by @entity0 a 21 - year - old has told how glamour modelling saved her from depression and gave her her life back			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , used to suffer from panic attacks , anxiety and @entity10 when she was in school , making her life a misery			1
her confidence plummeted and the situation became so bad that @entity5 stopped attending classes			1
@entity5 says glamour modelling is all about her transformation and her independence but after she started modelling for lads ' mags , @entity5 shed more than just her clothes - she lost her anxiety too			1
ironically one of the strongest sources of teasing was her lack of a chest - with other girls bullying her for her slow development			2
@entity5 says : ' when i was 12 , everyone else had boobs but me - girls used to laugh and call me ' aa '			1
' it ’s ironic really considering how things turned out			0
' i suffered badly with depression - @entity10 , panic attacks and all sorts of things			1
' i did n’t enjoy school at all - i had no self - confidence and did n’t want to see other people - in the end i just told my mum i was n’t going			1
' despite not turning up very often , @entity5 still did well in her gcses , but it was n’t until she turned 18 that her confidence began to return			1
@entity5 , pictured aged 13 , used to suffer from panic attacks , anxiety and @entity10 when she was in school , making her life a misery @entity5 boldly started her own career by approaching magazines with pictures she had taken herself @entity5 says she finds glamour modelling empowering and is proud to show off her body , flaws included following her ' feel the fear and do it anyway ' motto , she took herself down to a promotional photo shoot			1
armed with the pictures , she built up her portfolio and started sending them to the lads ' mags and soon found herself garnering attention from the industry			2
she said : ' people say all these things about glamour modelling , but for me , it totally turned my life around			0
@entity5 says her father has now come to terms with her career choice ' a lot of that is to do with a feminist petition saying they were against it for objectifying , almost dehumanising , women			2
' but for me it was absolutely the opposite			0
it was about female power , and taking a stand , and saying " this is me , this is who i am , this is my body ”			0
' seeing myself in those magazines had a massive impact on my confidence - i finally felt like me again			1
' however , her path into the industry has n’t always been smooth , especially for her relationship with her father			0
@entity5 said : ' when i first started he was n’t happy because i ’m his little girl			2
' but i spoke to him and said , " i ’m a woman now , this is my choice , there ’s nothing wrong with what i ’m doing , and i want to be open and honest with my family ”			0
' once we had that conversation he was happy with my decision			0
' she ’s quick to point out that she does n’t do modelling for an ego trip and shies away from flashing her flesh on social media			0
@entity5 says it ’s all about her transformation and her independence			2
defiant @entity5 said : ' i ’ve got imperfections , scars and cellulite , just like any other woman , and i ’m still putting myself out there			2
' i ’m not scared of people ’s opinions or judgments - for me it ’s about independence , taking charge of your own life , and just being comfortable in your own skin			0
' you ’re always going to be judged , from the first moment you step out of the house until you return			0
' if you ’re happy and you feel good about the choices you make , then what else matters ? '			0
