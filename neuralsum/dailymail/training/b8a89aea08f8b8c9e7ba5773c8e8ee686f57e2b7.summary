pictured is @entity1 of @entity2 who claims to have come up with the ' holy grail ' of lighting a @entity6 company has beaten global giants to invent the ‘ holy grail ’ of light bulbs : a low energy unit which is as bright as a traditional bulb			1
well - @entity2 claims it has solved the shortcomings of led lightbulbs , which have so far been unable to match the brightness of old - style incandescent bulbs			1
the new bulbs use 85 per cent less energy and will last up to nine years , according to the firm which is based in @entity19 , @entity6			1
it has done this using a new type of chip that improves phosphor conversion , which is the process by which light particles from an led chip are converted to a different colour			0
well - @entity2 ’s founder and managing director @entity1 , 36 , said : ‘ we ’re excited to get our revolutionary bulbs out the public			1
‘ when someone says “ they are as bright as a normal bulb ” , that ’s what i want to hear			0
it ’s like the holy grail of the @entity38 world			0
’ the brightness of bulbs is measured by the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , which gives a score out of 100 to determine how vivid a light source makes the true colours appear			2
almost every single led lamp currently on sale in the @entity50 only has a @entity44 rating of around 80 - that is 20 per cent less than the traditional incandescent bulbs , according to well - @entity54 but well - lit ’s new units , which start at around £ 10 ( £ 16 ) , claim to have pushed that number up to 97			1
pictured are the led lightbulbs that are a direct replacement for a @entity60 and standard lightbulb			0
the bulbs use 85 per cent less energy and will last up to nine years , according to @entity2 which is based in @entity19 ‘ to achieve our market leading @entity44 levels we produced a “ sunlight white ” performance led device , ’ said mr @entity1			1
he added that they used a series of unique quality control methods in the led production process to make the bulb shine as bright as possible			0
‘ our method for producing white light using a new type of chip and multiple phosphor conversion achieved a day light white led light that is far superior to the light emitted by other led lamps , ’ he said			0

they also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs			2
however , up until now , they have struggle to maintain the same level of brightness			0

their technology uses blue leds , which last week landed three @entity110 - born scientists the @entity111 in physics after they invented it in the 1990s			2
@entity114 and @entity115 of @entity110 and @entity117 scientist @entity116 won the award for their invention , which has led to the use of environmentally - friendly light sources worldwide			0

estimates suggest led technology , used in everything from homes to billboards today , will be worth £ 50 billion ( $ 80 billion ) in 2020			2
@entity116 ( left ) , @entity114 ( centre ) and @entity115 ( right ) , all born in @entity110 , last week won the 2014 @entity138 , for their environmentally - friendly blue leds			0
the lighting breakthrough creates more energy - efficient home lighting , and can improve keyhole surgery techniques			0

device was invented by @entity2 from @entity19 , @entity6
leds are more efficient and last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament bulbs
up until now , leds struggled to match brightness of incandescent bulbs
well - @entity2 *'s* lights claim to last nine years and start from around £ 10 ( $ 16 )
