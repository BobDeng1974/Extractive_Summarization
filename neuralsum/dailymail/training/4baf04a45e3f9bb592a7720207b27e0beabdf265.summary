by @entity0 they were a hardworking couple from the wartime generation that never dreamt of claiming anything from the state			1
but , despite paying taxes all their lives , when @entity10 's wife @entity9 , 82 , suffered a severe stroke that left her needing round - the - clock care , no help was forthcoming			1
in a sickening example of authorities ' reluctance to pay care home bills – even when legally obliged to do so – health officials ruled that the former church organist 's nursing fees had to come out of the couple 's savings			1
denied funding : @entity23 suffered a severe stroke aged 82 it was only once they had paid more than £ 80,000 for mrs @entity23 's care – including selling their house – that it emerged she was entitled to state support for the £ 1,500 - a - month fees			1
after a five - year legal battle , her family have won back £ 80,000 made up of repaid fees and interest payments , but tragically @entity36 and mrs @entity23 both died before the claim was resolved			1
lawyers specialising in reclaiming nursing fees warned that a huge backlog of cases means other elderly people will die before justice is done and the @entity44 could face a bill for hundreds of millions of pounds			2
under @entity49 law , elderly people with assets worth more than £ 23,000 must pay for their residential care unless it is health - related			2
but the @entity54 's dignity for the elderly campaign has highlighted the unfairness for those who are wrongly told they are ineligible despite suffering @entity59 's , parkinson 's disease or a stroke			0
primary care trusts – which were responsible for funding ' continuing care ' on the @entity44 until the role was given to clinical commissioning groups – interpreted national guidelines differently , resulting in a postcode lottery			0

but she suffered a huge stroke in 2004			0
paralysed on one side and unable to speak or feed herself , she moved into a nursing home			0
social services told her daughter that as home - owners with reasonable savings the couple would have to fund the place themselves			2
unaware that her health needs meant she was entitled to free care , they agreed to pay privately			0
two years later the couple 's £ 200,000 semi-detached home had to be sold as mr @entity10 was struggling to manage on his own and mr @entity10 moved in with his daughter @entity101			1
' it was an incredibly stressful time , ' mrs @entity101 said			0
' i was trying to look after my dad while running a business during the day and trying to get to see my mother as often as i could … my health suffered and we were left with no savings at all			2
' in 2008 mrs @entity101 began a legal bid to reclaim the fees , but her mother died the next year aged 86 and her 90 - year - old father died 15 months later			1
' my father fought for his country , he and my mother paid all their taxes and never claimed anything from the @entity120 , and yet … they were totally let down , ' mrs @entity101 said			0
