@entity0 last night threw @entity1 a political lifeline by following his lead in giving @entity5 politicians the chance to veto air strikes on @entity8			1
in an unprecedented move , the president said he was determined to bomb @entity8 – but not until @entity11 voted on the matter			1
in theory , as commander - in - chief of @entity5 forces , he could ignore any @entity11 vote against military action , but having invited them to do so it is considered highly unlikely			1
president @entity0 has declared the @entity5 should take military action against @entity22 's regime speaking at the @entity24 rose garden , president @entity0 said he would seek congressional backing for any intervention the @entity8 army restarted its barrage on the rebel - held suburbs of @entity31 just two minutes after president @entity0 finished his speech threatening air strikes			1
the attacks had stopped five hours earlier			0
regime forces also immediately ‘ intensified ’ attacks on @entity37 in @entity8			2
but on the streets of @entity31 , those opposing @entity22 reacted with fury and disbelief that @entity5 intervention was not imminent			2
‘ what did we go through all that for ? ’ asked one woman			0
’ speaking from the @entity47 , mr @entity0 referred directly to mr @entity1 ’s decision to allow mps to vote on the issue and again referred to @entity51 as @entity53 ’s ‘ closest ally ’			1
mr @entity1 ’s gamble backfired when @entity56 leader @entity55 , backed by @entity58 and @entity59 rebels , inflicted a shock defeat , keeping @entity51 out of the conflict			2
@entity58 mps feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to mr @entity1 ’s standing at home and abroad – and to the @entity5 ‘ special relationship			1
’ but mr @entity0 ’s extraordinary decision to emulate mr @entity1 , immediately hailed by the prime minister ’s supporters as ‘ a huge compliment ’ , could turn the tables on mr @entity55 , who believed he had scored a notable success			1
as @entity76 inspectors crossed the border from @entity8 into @entity78 , they were followed out of the war - torn country by a continuous flow of families within minutes of mr @entity0 ’s statement , a relieved mr @entity1 tweeted : ‘ i understand and support @entity0 ’s position on # @entity8			1
’ and foreign secretary @entity85 tweeted : ‘ a fine speech by the @entity87 on # @entity8			0
’ the extraordinary development from @entity89 came at the end of mr @entity1 ’s worst week in no 10 since winning power in 2010			0
the prime minister was widely criticised for misjudging his plan to support @entity5 plans to punish the @entity8 regime after the massacre of hundreds of civilians near @entity31			2
according to @entity5 intelligence reports , 1,429 people were killed by chemical weapons on august 21 , including hundreds of children			2
the prime minister quickly took to @entity103 to endorse the president 's approach mr @entity0 ’s warm praise for @entity51 came only 24 hours after the @entity24 had called @entity107 , which has backed the military action , as its ‘ oldest ally ’			1
in one sentence , mr @entity0 appears to have restored the old order			0
mr @entity0 ’s comments about the need for a democratic vote on strikes against @entity8 echoed almost word - for - word mr @entity1 ’s justification for asking mps to support him			1
flanked by vice-president @entity120 , the president said that he remained convinced military action against @entity22 was needed and that there was no need to wait for the @entity76 weapons inspectors to report on the massacre			1
then he explained why he was taking the same democratic course as mr @entity1 : ‘ many people have advised against taking this decision to @entity11 and undoubtedly they were impacted by what we saw happen in the @entity51 this week when the @entity131 of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal , even as the prime minister supported taking action			1
' yet , while i believe i have the authority to carry out this action without specific congressional authorisation i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more effective			0
’ a source close to mr @entity1 said : ‘ we are delighted the president has done this			1
it vindicates the prime minister completely			0
’ president @entity0 revealed advisers had cautioned against going to @entity11 , particularly in light of the @entity154 defeat @entity1 suffered mr @entity0 said : ‘ we saw terrible images of the dead			1
all told 1,000 people were murdered including several hundred children			0
@entity158 were gassed to death by their own government			0
this was an assault on human dignity and a serious danger to security			0
’ mr @entity0 assured the @entity5 public : ‘ we will not put boots on the ground ’ but said the @entity5 was ‘ prepared to strike whenever we choose ’			2
he added , ‘ i know well that we are weary of war			0
that is why we ’re not contemplating putting our troops in the middle [ of a civil war ]			0
but we can not and must not turn a blind eye to actions in @entity31			0
’ where could they strike ? this map of @entity8 highlights the main strategic towns in the strife - torn country @entity181 : locations within the @entity8 capital that would likely bear the brunt of any attack however @entity186 yesterday dismissed claims that @entity8 used chemical weapons as ‘ nonsense ’ and challenged the @entity53 to provide proof before launching air strikes			1
the @entity193 president insisted that if @entity89 had evidence @entity22 ’s forces ‘ used weapons of mass destruction ’ it should be presented to the @entity76			2
but mr @entity186 said : ‘ if they say that the [ @entity8 ] governmental forces used weapons of mass destruction … and that they have proof of it , let them present it to the @entity76 inspectors and the @entity76 security council			1
‘ claims that the proof exists , but is classified and can not be presented to anybody , are below criticism			0
’ there was no immediate response to mr @entity186 ’s intervention from the @entity24			0
a @entity76 convoy of vehicles , carrying the @entity76 team of inspectors , crosses into @entity78 from @entity8 , at the @entity78 border crossing point of @entity220 , eastern @entity221 , @entity78 @entity76 weapons inspectors arrive at the headquarters of the @entity224 , in @entity225 , in the @entity226 president @entity0 said he was ' comfortable going forward without the approval of a @entity76 @entity228 ' that had so far been ' unwilling to hold @entity22 accountable ' the president faces an uphill battle to get @entity11 permission to attack @entity8			1
as it stands , the @entity234 - controlled lower @entity233 will almost certainly deny permission while the @entity236 - controlled @entity235 might give him a reluctant go ahead			0
some @entity89 - based analysts said last night that mr @entity0 could suffer the same humiliation as mr @entity1 – and lose the vote			1
his decision to delay military was criticised by @entity8 ’s main opposition party , the @entity242			2
a spokesman said : ‘ i am surprised that the president said he has the legal authority and the moral responsibility to respond but then to pass this on to @entity11			2
‘ the people of @entity8 will feel that this is inaction			0
‘ this is a failure of leadership on the president ’s part			0
‘ i thought this announcement was to tell the whole world that he is going to punish this brutal regime and let them know they can not use chemical weapons against their own people			0
’ but last night @entity8 ’s prime minister @entity261 said his country was prepared for @entity5 military action			1
he said : ‘ the @entity8 army is fully ready , its finger on the trigger to face any challenge or scenario that they want to carry out			0

president @entity0 has said the @entity5 should take military action against @entity8
but he wants to put plans to a vote in @entity11 before launching attack
decision throws political lifeline to humiliated @entity1
source close to the @entity281 says it ' vindicates ' his choice to go to commons
