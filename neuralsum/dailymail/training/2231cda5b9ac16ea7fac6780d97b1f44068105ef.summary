@entity25 : @entity1 celebrates his win overcome : he defeated @entity20 's @entity4 @entity1 ( 19 - 0 , @entity27 wins ) was eager to impress against 34 - year - old @entity4 ( 22 - 0 , @entity28 ) , who was unbeaten coming in but having never faced anyone of note			1
the southpaw looked slick as usual in the opening stages at the @entity34 and a southpaw right looked hurtful in the second , only for @entity36 to bounce back with an immediate counter			0
@entity1 seemed to be boxing within himself and was well ahead by the middle stages , though he did not have it all his own way			2
the @entity42 's occasional bolo punches were decent but rarely built upon , though his timing was impressive as usual			0
the action livened a little in the seventh as @entity1 - who had failed to knock out his four previous opponents - engaged in more of a fight with @entity4 , himself with an unintimidating stoppage record			1

the @entity63 , smelling blood , charged forward and landed again as @entity65 referee @entity64 moved in to administer a standing count			0
however , the @entity20 corner threw the towel in when they saw their man in dire straights and the official waved the fight off			2
on the undercard , @entity74 pulled out a shot from nowhere in the sixth to keep his @entity9 light - middleweight title against midlander @entity79			1
@entity79 , from @entity80 , had been impressing the crowd with his intelligent pressure until @entity83 uncorked a lovely right to the body from which @entity79 could not recover			0

' my timing was a bit out after 10 months out but i landed the shot			0
