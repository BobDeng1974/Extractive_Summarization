federal prosecutors are accusing a former @entity2 marksman of the cold attempted murder of his wife of 35 years who is suffering from dementia			1
wife @entity7 , 55 , was staying at a friend 's house last month when prosecutors say her husband , 58 - year - old @entity11 , broke in and shot her and her friend 's husband because his mistress threatened to go public with their six - year affair			1
both mrs @entity7 and the husband survived the attack , though prosecutors would n't reveal their conditions			1
while his wife continued to recover from her nearly - fatal injuries , @entity7 spent @entity23 with his girlfriend in @entity25 , renting a limousine and sure that he had been ruled as a person of interest in the december 12 shooting			1
but authorities arrested the @entity32 , @entity34 man on sunday , after amassing damning evidence they say proves he planned the shooting and places him at the scene of the crime			1
heartless : @entity11 , a former @entity2 marksman , was arrested sunday after prosecutors accused him of shooting his wife and a family friend at this home in @entity45 , @entity46 last month double life : prosecutors say the shooting happened two weeks after @entity51 's mistress of six years threatened to expose their affair			1
above , investigators take evidence at the scene of the shooting @entity7 appeared in @entity46 federal court for the first time on monday , dressed in yellow prison garb indicated his status as a maximum - security prisoner , as he was charged with interstate domestic violence and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence			1
if convicted of both crimes , @entity7 could spend the rest of his life in prison			2
the @entity73 have been married for 35 years , but at least for the last six , @entity11 was engaged in an affair with a woman only identified as ' @entity76 ' in court papers from @entity78 , @entity25			1
@entity73 ' job working for a @entity81 paramilitary company involved travel , so it perhaps did n't raise any alarms to mrs @entity7 that he spent so much time away from home			2
each month , prosecutors revealed , @entity7 spent living a double life in @entity78 with his girlfriend and socializing with her circle of friends			2
two weeks before the shooting however , @entity51 's mistress became upset when he accidentally called her from @entity34 and she overheard a conversation with his wife which convinced her that he would never get a divorce			1
the mistress , who was visiting with the @entity96 at @entity78 police chief at the time of the distressing call , allegedly threatened to reveal the affair ' by publishing photos of the two of them together in the local newspaper ' according to an affidavit			1
a week before @entity108 , mrs @entity107 's lifelong friend @entity106 picked her up in @entity32 to spend some time at her home in @entity45 , @entity46			0
shaky alibi : @entity7 told police that he was at home on the night of the shooting , but they found evidence that shows he may have plotted to kill his wife , and which places him at the scene			1
above , the @entity73 ' home in @entity32 , @entity34 mrs @entity107 's elderly parents live in the @entity46 town , and mrs @entity106 thought it would offer @entity7 a break from caring for his dementia - stricken wife			1
the shooting happened at the @entity106 's home in the early hours of december 18 , while mrs @entity7 was sleeping in one of their guest bedrooms			1
@entity106 rose the alarm when she heard breaking glass around 3am and woke her husband			0
investigators later found a window into the garage broken , believed to be the intruder 's point of entry			0
her husband @entity140 left their bedroom and entered the hall where he first saw the male intruder ' dressed in dark clothing and wearing a ski mask , carrying a handgun at the top of the stair landing '			0
the intruder proceeded to the second guest bedroom where @entity7 was sleeping and shot her four times - including once in the back of the head			2
he then chased mr @entity140 , who hid in a closet and tried to call 911			0
mr @entity140 later told investigators that the masked - man was wearing glasses similar to a pair he had seen @entity73 wear before			0
mr @entity140 was also shot at three times in the arm , shoulder and back as he barricaded himself in the closet			0
his wife @entity106 remained unharmed in the attack , hiding underneath a piece of furniture			0
according to court documents , @entity51 's behavior immediately before and after the shooting made him a suspect in the crime			0
footprints at the scene , suspicious @entity175 searches and blood stains also connected @entity73 to the heinous crime			0
three hours after the shooting , police arrived at @entity7 home and felt that the hood of his car was warm			1
they later pulled @entity7 over as he drove to a convenience store near his home and informed him that his wife had been shot			1
instead of asking what had happened and how his wife was doing , @entity7 immediately feigned a heart attack , though he refused to go to the hospital			1
he told police that he spent the night at home , working on his computer , and only left once to go get donuts and coffee			0
security camera footage shows him going to a @entity199 ; donuts at 4:50am			0
prior to that he was also captured on a convenience store 's cctv at 12:11am , giving him plenty of time to drive to and from the @entity106 's home to commit the crime in between			0
while an analysis of @entity7 ' computer show she was using it at 2:16am , it was also revealed that he looked up how to change the clock on a computer to conceal the actual time it was used early the previous day			2
they determined that the files had actually been accessed some two hours after the shooting			0
@entity73 ' boss also told police that he asked him to lie and say that they had been video chatting at the time of the shooting			0
he says @entity7 is no longer employed at the company , based in @entity81			2
in a search of @entity51 's home and car they also found clothes matching the description of the intruder in a washing machine and blood stains			0
two 9mm handguns and about 15 rounds of the same 27 - year - old ammunition used in the shooting were also found at @entity7 ' house			1
investigators took a cast of a footprint imprinted in a flower bed on the @entity106 's property and discovered that it matched @entity7 ' size 11 boots			2
mrs @entity7 and mr @entity140 were rushed to @entity249 in the aftermath of the shootings where they both underwent multiple surgeries			2
it 's unclear what condition they are in as prosecutors refused to say , citing privacy			0
instead of dutifully attending to his wife as she continued to recover at the hospital , a confident @entity73 spent @entity23 in @entity25 with his girlfriend , even renting a limousine			0
he allegedly told his mistress ' family and friends that he had been cleared as a person of interest in his wife 's shooting , claiming he was in @entity273 at the time and had a letter to prove it			1
@entity7 was ordered held without bond on monday , at least until his next hearing on january 21 .			2

@entity11 was arrested sunday in connection to a december 12 shooting which injured his wife and a family friend
the shooting happened two weeks after @entity7 ' mistress of six years threatened to expose their affair
