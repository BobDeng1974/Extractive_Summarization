the lawyer for one of @entity3 's murderers today revealed the ' living nightmare ' of representing the notorious child killer			1
speaking ahead of the 20th anniversary of the toddler 's death , @entity6 recalled how he was convinced that ' angelic - looking ' @entity3 must be innocent of the brutal crime			1
he also claimed that were it not for the malign influence of @entity15 , whom he compared to ' the @entity17 ' , @entity11 would never have taken part in the killing			1
the 10 - year - old was on his way to school to pick up some gerbils which his teacher had asked him to look after , but was apparently led astray by @entity15 telling him : ' forget the gerbils , let 's go robbing			1
he and @entity15 had been caught on cctv six days earlier holding two - year - old @entity36 by the hand and leading him through the @entity39 shopping centre in @entity40 , near @entity41			1
over the following hours , they beat and tortured him before leaving him for dead on a nearby railway line			2
but mr @entity6 said today that in his first meeting with his client , he found it impossible to believe that he could be guilty			1
' he was like an angelic - looking eight - year - old , ' said the solicitor , who now runs his own law firm in @entity41			1
' i thought , " what am i doing here ? he could n’t be capable of anything like this			2
" he was so convincing in his first interview that he had been nowhere near the @entity39			2
' @entity35 : the two - year - old being led away from the @entity39 shopping centre in @entity40 by the older boys @entity11 claimed that he had been near @entity58 with @entity15 , and said neither of them had been at the shopping centre where the toddler went missing			1
mr @entity6 , 59 , said : ' i believed him			2
and it was only after there was a time - out and the officers who interviewed @entity15 had a briefing and came back for the second interview			1
' and again i was in blissful ignorance thinking , it ’s the easiest money - i felt guilty , actually , because this boy had had nothing to do with anything , i thought - until having got him cosy with his little space pens and his can of @entity78 , they kept him nice and relaxed and they said : " look we ’ve spoken to @entity15 and he says you were in the @entity39			1
" ' heartbreak : the 20th anniversary of the murder of @entity84 , pictured , is coming up on tuesday after a silence @entity11 responded : ' well ok , we were in the @entity39 but we never grabbed a kid			1
' mr @entity6 said : ' he got up and he grabbed his mum and he was crying and i thought , " @entity90 , what have i let myself in for here ? " ' the walls came crashing in at that moment and i knew what he was like , and it was like a living nightmare			2
' he said that from that point he was ' caught up in a maelstrom of massive criminology ' which he could never have prepared for , and described how police had to check his car to ensure he was not targeted by vigilantes in a reprisal attack			2
' i had never been in this position before , ' he said			2
' i thought i was going to get assassinated or something at first because the public ’s feelings - including my own - were running high			2
' mr @entity6 sympathised with @entity11 ' parents , whom he described as ' very respectable people ' , saying that the boy 's upbringing was ' no worse than any kid in @entity41 '			2
he put the blame for the murder squarely on the shoulders of the other 10 - year - old : ' @entity15 had this kind of hold			1
he was like the @entity17			0
' according to mr @entity6 , @entity11 had been asked by his teacher to look after the class pets : ' he was on his way to pick up the gerbils from the school , and it was only because he bumped into @entity15 who said , " forget the gerbils , let 's go robbing "			1
' the lawyer criticised officials for choosing to hold the children 's trial in the main courtroom at @entity133 , saying : ' they could n’t have found a more daunting venue than @entity135 at @entity133			1
' appeal : the child 's parents @entity140 and @entity141 during a press conference after their son 's disappearance however , mr @entity6 also expressed sympathy for the @entity146 , and said he would have been willing to prosecute @entity11 and @entity15			1
' my number one sentiment is for @entity141 [ @entity84 ’s mother ] - still is and always will be , ' he said			2
' the wounds re-open for that lady every time this comes up and now must be horrendous for her			0

' the fact that the perpetrators were also young children , for so many people that blew their minds			0
they could n’t understand how this could happen			0
