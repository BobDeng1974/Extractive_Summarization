by @entity0 smiling again : @entity1 underwent surgery to fix her underbite when @entity1 first noticed her lower jaw jutted out further than her upper jaw , during her early teens , she assumed the problem would correct itself			1
instead , the mismatch only became more pronounced			2
within a few years her underbite – where the lower jaw is further forward than the top – was so severe that chewing food was difficult			1
‘ i already had orthodontic braces to correct my crooked teeth and i hoped they ’d fix my underbite , ’ says @entity1 , 26 , who works in @entity12 ‘ but my lower jaw gradually got more prominent and unsightly , and by the time i was 17 it was really uncomfortable			1
‘ eating was hard as my teeth did n’t fit together properly			2
i did n’t eat apples because it was too much effort trying to bite into them and i had to get food to the back of my throat and chew it much more			1
i also felt really self - conscious as my jaw looked odd			0
’ an underbite is a type of deformity known medically as a reverse overjet			1
it is caused by an overgrowth of the lower jaw or the upper jaw not developing properly , or a combination of the two			0
‘ @entity43 deformities are quite common and affect about ten per cent of the population , ’ explains @entity37 , consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			0
‘ an underbite can sometimes cause jaw - joint problems , such as pain or clicking , and patients find it hard to bite into foods			1
' there ’s often also a psychological impact too as it can appear strange and alter looks			0
’ an underbite can occasionally be corrected with orthodontic braces alone but if the deformity is severe – as in @entity1 ’s case – surgery is needed to reposition and realign the jaws			1
this is performed by surgeons qualified in both medicine and dentistry , and only on patients aged over 18 whose bones have stopped growing			1
‘ @entity43 surgery is a major undertaking and the entire process takes about 18 months ’ says mr @entity37			1
‘ people with an underbite often have rotated or angled teeth , caused by the mouth adapting , and these must be completely straightened and aligned before the operation by an orthodontist			1
otherwise it ’s impossible to work out where the jaws should be and teeth wo n’t fit together correctly			1
’ before the op : @entity1 pictured before the surgery , when her protruding jaw meant that she struggled to chew her food properly patients wear braces for a year – and they remain on during the procedure			1
once the teeth are straight , the surgeon takes x-rays of the jaw and makes a cast of the teeth , and uses a metal hinge known as an articulator to simulate how the teeth should meet			0
‘ once the correct position is determined , plastic wafers are made to sit on the teeth during the operation and show where the jaw should be , ’ says mr @entity37			1
‘ a great deal of planning happens before the surgery			0
’ the operation is performed under general anaesthetic and through the mouth , via incisions in the gums , to prevent scarring to the face			2
‘ to move the upper jaw , we break and detach it from the base of the skull , then reposition it , ’ says mr @entity37			2
‘ to move the lower jaw , we cut the sides of the jaw using a surgical saw			0
’ the jaw can then be slid forwards or backwards until it is in the correct position – marked by the wafers			0
it is fixed together again with titanium plates and screws , then the gums are sewn up with dissolving stitches			2
titanium is used because it is bio-compatible , so it can stay in for life			0
@entity1 had four screws inserted and had a thin slice of bone removed from her jaw , to improve the fit			1
@entity138 usually takes two to three hours and requires a short stay in hospital			1
‘ afterwards patients experience swelling , numbness and discomfort for several weeks , ’ says mr @entity37			0
‘ painkillers are prescribed and patients see their final appearance two to three months later			2
@entity148 stay on for up to six months			2
’ @entity1 ’s recovery from the @entity151 surgery took about five weeks			1
‘ after the operation the pain was extreme , despite the painkillers , and there was a lot of blood in my mouth , ’ she says			2
‘ my jaw was locked shut , due to the pain , and my cheeks were like footballs			0
' the first few days i was kept on a drip , then i started drinking nutrient shakes through a straw			0
after a few weeks i moved on to soft foods then later back on to solids			0
‘ although my bottom lip and part of my chin are now numb , which doctors warned could happen , i have n’t had any pain since			2
' the ordeal was definitely worth it – i am now able to chew food comfortably , can eat what i like and i breathe more easily			1
‘ once the swelling had completely gone , i had a normal - looking face and was thrilled			0
it was like looking at a different person in the mirror			0
‘ now i feel much more confident about my appearance , whereas before there was a major imperfection			0
‘ my face is all in proportion and the new jaw position even makes my cheekbones more pronounced			0
‘ having the surgery was the best decision i ’ve ever made			0

@entity1 , 26 , had such a *bad* underbite she struggled to chew her food
it *worsened* during her teens and @entity1 decided to have an operation
@entity138 saw doctors break both her jaws to ' set them right ' with titanic plates
the procedure took 18 months from start to finish
