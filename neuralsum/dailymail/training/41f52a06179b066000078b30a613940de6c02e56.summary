@entity1 coach @entity0 remains convinced the @entity2 was set up to favour hosts @entity4			1
@entity4 and @entity1 face each other in @entity6 on saturday to decide who ends the tournament in third place			1
the third - place play - off is not a popular match and both coaches would of course much rather be contesting the final 24 hours later in the @entity14			1
@entity48 was angry that @entity4 , as winners of @entity57 , were allowed to play their second - round and quarter - final games before everyone else			2
as hosts , they also played their opening group game against @entity64 first			0
his comments provoked outrage from @entity4 coach @entity67 , but the @entity69 manager in waiting is standing by his words			1
' i will stick to the facts , ' @entity48 told a press conference			2
' the facts are that @entity4 started first			2
and @entity4 again has played first again and we played a day later			0
' these are the facts			0
i am not going to beat around bush			0
then you know what the implications are if that is the case			0
answering back : @entity67 was previously incensed by comments from the @entity1 boss hair raising : the @entity4 coach speaks to @entity87 forward @entity88 during a final training session case for the defence : @entity92 ( r ) and @entity93 prepare for their final match of @entity4 2014 @entity96 moves : @entity4 players @entity97 ( r ) and @entity98 show off their skills during training forgiven ? @entity92 cradles a baby while meeting @entity4 supporters at a training session ' the question is why ? i think @entity67 should think about that if he wants to do that and is allowed to do that			1
' @entity48 â€™s annoyance has clearly been heightened by the fact that @entity4 have had another day to prepare for the third - place play - off			1
' we have one day less than @entity4 , ' @entity48 added			0
' we have to get into shape in two - and - a - half days , which physically is hard			0
