‘ he asked me if i had played for @entity2 and when i said yes , he shook his head as if in disbelief and said , “ well , that was n’t @entity2 football ”			1
’ that ’s @entity8 reflecting on a unsavoury spat with @entity10 in 2007 after the @entity13 ’s @entity12 side had parked the proverbial bus and ruffled a few feathers in the @entity16 ranks on the way to a 0 - 0 draw at @entity19			1
and then there ’s this from february 2014 when @entity2 travelled to @entity23 in the @entity24 , a match won comfortably by the @entity25 with @entity10 operating as a false no 9			1
below par : @entity10 has struggled to win over the @entity2 fans since his move ‘ some people were talking a bit too much before the game and now they have to shut up for a few days , ’ @entity10 told @entity30			1
the dig aimed squarely at @entity35 who had earlier referred claimed the team travelling to @entity38 were the worst @entity2 for many years			1
the very idea then that the summer ’s biggest transfer could well involve @entity43 football ’s prodigal son and @entity45 ’s bête noire seems deeply uncomfortable , not least to @entity16 fans			1
to the rest of the world , having @entity2 on your cv would be considered a high point			2
to @entity35 , it seems the spell as ‘ the translator ’ he spent under the tutelage of the late , great sir @entity56 is a blot against his copybook of footballing ideals			0
these two are n’t just unrealistic bed - fellows , the argument could be made that they do n’t play the same sport			0
spot on : @entity10 was a vital part of the @entity16 team before leaving in 2007 it ’s been argued that @entity10 ’ shortcomings in @entity68 are due to the fact his much - fabled ‘ dna ’ had changed			1
he was certainly a more developed player physically than his colleagues , relying a blustering will to burst into spaces and exploit whatever tiny gaps could be found by the movement of those around him			0
however , touting him as a replacement for @entity79 seems wide of the mark			2
the @entity81 was a master of timing without the ball – arriving late , finding a yard - @entity10 was very much in his element with it as his feet			2
one remembers the lung - busting run from the halfway line against @entity89 in the ‘ 11 - second derby ’ or the neat exchange with @entity92 in order to pick the lock of the @entity96 defence in 2006			0
whenever he did send one crashing in from range , it was the result of his own hard work			0
his genius simply would n’t flourish in the restrained world of @entity104 all the exits from the @entity19 in the last half - decade , only really that of captain @entity10 has passed without the vitriolic out - pouring familiar with the departure of star names			2
crunch : @entity79 tackles @entity10 during a @entity24 game between @entity112 and @entity2 in 2012 the young tyro had given eight years – three as captain , leader , legend - of his life and career as the heartbeat of a project whose foundations were now at their weakest			1
his departure to @entity2 for a knockdown $ 35million stuck in the throat only because of the behavior of his captors – ‘ @entity127 ’ anyone - not through any angst towards the man himself			2
the @entity130 had conducted himself admirably throughout his time in north @entity132 – the odd throw of a pizza aside – and was now yearning for a return to a team being feted as perhaps the greatest we had ever seen			0
the fans had sent him on his way with their blessing , they had dusted themselves down and admitted defeat to a higher power			0
like the girlfriend with whom you always knew you were punching above your weight , sometimes you just have to hold your hands up			0
yet should @entity10 return to the @entity150 , and to @entity112 , one ca n’t help but imagine what it would be like to see your first love arm - in - arm with a someone so at odds with what you thought made them great ; an older , uglier , more unpopular partner , in whom a bulge can only be found in his wallet and his gut , the one he ’s stuffed with goodies thanks to the irritatingly successful pursuit of paid - for - popularity			1
it ’s not exactly very ‘ @entity2 ’ ; just ask @entity8			0
@entity166 bound : @entity10 ( right ) is currently with the @entity68 squad ahead of the world			0

@entity2 are happy for the @entity43 *midfielder* to leave the @entity171
@entity10 has been linked with a move to @entity112 to replace @entity79
played for @entity16 for eight years before leaving in 2007
