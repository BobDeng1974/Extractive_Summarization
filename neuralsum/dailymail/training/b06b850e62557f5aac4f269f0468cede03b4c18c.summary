as he left court , @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m so sorry ’ and refused to answer further questions			2

up to 800 more families have been told their children could have been at risk during the five years @entity0 worked for @entity11 ( pictured ) in @entity12 ‘ he would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them			1
‘ what makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination			1
i was n’t a case of “ do n’t tell your parents ”			0
he was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination			0

‘ i am so deeply sorry these incidents have happened and i am also deeply saddened , as a doctor , that one of my own profession has placed himself and his patients in this position			2
‘ there is a very ancient and sacred trust that exists between a doctor and his patients and , quite frankly , it sickens me to think that trust has been breached			2
’ chief nurse @entity141 said : ‘ his cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all , including staff who worked alongside him to care for these vulnerable and sick children			1

he had almost become part of the family			0
‘ we had every bit of trust in him			0
@entity0 , we thought , was a good doctor			2
but he had a very dark secret he was hiding from the parents			0
‘ i think that makes it even harder to swallow – the fact he was hiding it from all of us who trusted him			0
’ the parents of one of the doctor ’s alleged victims , who has leukaemia , told the @entity110 they felt ‘ betrayed and numb ’			0
the mother , who can not be named for legal reasons , said : ‘ i ’m kicking myself because i never thought to say why is there no one else in the room ? but we never queried it because of his position			0
