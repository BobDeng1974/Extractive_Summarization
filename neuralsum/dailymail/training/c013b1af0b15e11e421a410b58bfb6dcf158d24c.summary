i could n’t believe it when i saw the damage			2
' on the night it happened there was the shock of the house being shunted then the horrific noise the house made			0
it sounded like it was falling down			0
we looked out of the window and we saw this great big car sat on our garden			0
' considering the state of him already being disqualified from driving i think it is disgusting he was on the road in the first place			2

there are little kids playing in the street all the time , he could have easily mowed a little girl down			2

it ’s caused a big upheaval			0
' the insurance have been and will put it right			0
the cost will be £ 50,000 plus some of the things like the palm trees we are n’t insured for			0
no doubt our premiums will be sky high next time			0
