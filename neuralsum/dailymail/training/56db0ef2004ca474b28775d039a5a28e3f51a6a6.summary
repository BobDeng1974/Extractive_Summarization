by @entity0 promises : labour welfare spokesman @entity2 will vow to raise the minimum wage , introduce living wage contracts and build homes @entity6 will today hit out at the ballooning cost of housing benefit for working families – despite opposing all attempts by the @entity11 to cut the bill			1
shadow minister @entity2 will unveil analysis showing that the number of employed people claiming the hand - out is set to double from 2010 to 2018			1
the extra cost during these years will be £ 12.9billion or £ 488 for each household in @entity19 , she will claim			0
in a speech at @entity21 , @entity22 , miss @entity2 will say it is wrong that a benefit meant for the poorest is increasingly propping up the income of low - paid workers			2
she will also condemn the @entity28 record on welfare as one of ‘ failure and waste ’			0
@entity6 promises to cut the housing benefit bill by raising the minimum wage and encouraging firms to pay the so - called living wage			1
the welfare spokeswoman will say : ‘ the number of working people claiming housing benefit is set to double because the @entity28 government has failed to tackle low pay , insecure work and the cost - of - living crisis			1
‘ that ’s meant thousands more people have been forced to rely on housing benefit to make ends meet			1
' @entity6 will raise the minimum wage , introduce living wage contracts and get 200,000 homes built a year by 2020 to tackle the housing benefit bill and ensure working people can make ends meet			1
’ miss @entity2 will also say that mr @entity53 has wasted huge amounts with his flagship @entity56 welfare reforms			0
she called for a three month pause while the @entity58 investigates it			0
‘ @entity53 promised a million people would be on @entity56 by april 2014 , ’ she said			0
‘ but the latest figures show less than 6,000 people are claiming			2

’ she will add : ‘ next may there is a big choice for the @entity19 people on social security			0
‘ a @entity28 economy based on low wages , failing programmes , waste and rising costs , or a @entity6 future with reforms to make work pay , tackle waste and reward people who do the right thing to get social security spending under control			2
’ waste : the welfare reforms brought in by @entity53 , left , should be paused , miss @entity2 said			0
but welfare minister @entity88 , right , blamed @entity6 for leaving the @entity11 with a ' culture of dependency ' a @entity28 source said the level of housing benefit for working people began to rise under @entity6 – not under the @entity11			1
welfare minister @entity88 said : ‘ we inherited an out - of - control housing benefit system from @entity6 that created a culture of dependency			1
their system saw some people claiming £ 104,000 a year of hardworking taxpayers ’ money to live in expensive areas			0
‘ we ’ve capped benefits so no family can claim more than the average family gets by going out to work and we ’ve put an end to unlimited housing benefit			1
this is all part of our - long - term economic plan to build a welfare system that provides a safety net for those in need , while rewarding the willingness to work			0
‘ but @entity6 have n’t learnt their lesson			2
they voted against our housing benefit cap , they voted against our overall cap on benefits and they still plan to borrow and spend more by restoring the spare room subsidy – landing future generations with more debt than they can ever hope to repay			2
