by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 made light work of @entity4 on saturday to win the @entity7 2014 women 's title			1
@entity2 won 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 on @entity8			1
host commentator the fastest women 's @entity7 final in 31 years , at 55 minutes			1
that 's all from us today , unfortunately it was n't the competitive final we 'd hoped for			0
back tomorrow for the men ! @entity4 receives a standing ovation , and says : ' i 'd like to congratulate @entity20 she 's played fantastic for two weeks			1
' really tough today but i 'm proud with how i 've played , i love coming here ' it 's a step in the right direction , i do n't know if i deserve all your love today but i really appreciate it			0
' genie 's been @entity4			1
no way - @entity2 was just sensational			1
what a display of hitting from the left - hander			0
i 'm all for competitive finals , but sometimes you just have to applaud a player seizing the opportunity to perform at the very highest level			0
both players have left the court while the roof closes for the presentation ceremony			0
where has that @entity2 been hiding since 2011			1
that was nearly two hours shorter than the @entity44 final , brilliant from the victor , sobering for @entity46			0
one of the best performances in @entity7 history that , @entity2 absolutely demolishes the helpless @entity4 , winning 6 - 3 , 6 - 0			1
you 've got to hand it to her , that was superb			0
up next , the winner 's ceremony ... the @entity55 star is on the brink here ... inevitable			0
@entity4 was up 40 - 15 up there , but again @entity2 manages to win the game			1
a winner on the stretch just sums up @entity46 's day			0
@entity61 : @entity62 having a long chat in the @entity64 with venerable journalist @entity66 - something of an odd couple			0
they are watching a fine display from @entity2			1
@entity4 forces @entity2 to deuce , but the @entity55 again lands her fastest serve at the tournament at 113mph when it matters most			1
this really could be over soon			0
another break for @entity2 , @entity4 just has no answer at the moment			1
she is pummeling her second serve , and the @entity55 does n't look like being broken at the moment ... another comfortable hold for @entity2 , she serves to love			1
something drastic has got to happen for this match to change			0
this final was always going to be about whether @entity2 , who is a wonderfully talented ball striker , would be able to let her talent flow and be free enough from nerves			1
i think we have the answer – this has been extremely high quality from the @entity55 and @entity4 has no answer			1
the @entity89 likes to take the ball early and dictate but she has just not had the chance			0
so far the mental strength of @entity4 has not been allowed to be a factor			2
another break of serve for @entity2 , that 's three in a row			1
she 's dictating play , with some huge returns			0
@entity4 's got a huge fight on her hands to get back in this one			2
@entity26 breaks back ! for the first time in the match the youngster manages to get on top in the rallies , taking full advantage			0
another break for @entity2 , who is playing the tennis of her life right now			2
nine winners compared to @entity4 's four			2
more huge serving from @entity2			2
@entity4 just ca n't deal with that first serve at the moment , losing 82 % of the time when it 's in			2
crucial hold for @entity46 - she was down 15 - 40 but recovers well			0
few unforced errors from @entity4 , but she is trailing on winners			2
while @entity2 is serving so strongly , @entity4 just ca n't get into the points			1
two aces already for the @entity55 , though @entity46 is trying to attack her second serve			0
a superb winner on the defensive from @entity2 wins her the game - @entity4 could be in for a long afternoon			1
she is already striking the ball superbly , and three winners in that game is enough to take the early advantage			0
can @entity26 fight back ? but @entity2 comes back with a comfortable hold herself , landing her fastest serve of the tournament so far in the process			2
vital early hold of serve for @entity4 , that should settle her nerves nicely			2
a typical powerful forehand beats @entity2 all ends up			1
@entity2 looking for her second @entity7 title , while the @entity89 is searching for her first ( surely of many ) @entity137			1
both have got better and better throughout the tournament , so we 're expecting a cracker			0
boost for the players ! we 're expecting them out on @entity8 shortly			2
while @entity4 and @entity2 prepare in the locker room before stepping out onto @entity8 , the men 's finalists @entity144 and @entity147 have already completed practice sessions ahead of their hotly - anticipated clash tomorrow			1
@entity144 hit with former player @entity152 " @entity151 in front of a large crowd out on @entity155			2
moments ago , i just walked past @entity144 round the back of the press centre and he could not look more relaxed as he casually strolled towards the broadcast area for pre-final interviews			2
@entity161 and @entity4 were once so close that the @entity89 stayed with @entity162 at her family home near the @entity164 when they played there			0
as teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars - including @entity173 - performing @entity172 dance moves			0
but there has been an acrimonious falling out			0
asked on friday if they were still close , @entity4 responded bluntly : ‘ no. i do n’t think so , ’ adding ‘ i ’m sure you guys can figure out that one ... i ’ll leave it at that			0
’ princess @entity46 was expected at @entity7 on saturday to watch from the @entity180 as @entity4 , the @entity89 tennis player named after her , contested the women 's singles final			1
other guests included the @entity184 , last year 's women 's champion @entity184 , @entity186 footballer @entity62 , the actress @entity187 , sports minister @entity187 , @entity188 golfer @entity184 and @entity191 's last women 's singles winner at @entity7 , @entity192			0
but we still have a fine day at @entity7 coming up for you			0
20 - year - old @entity4 has done so well to make it this far , but she has quite a task on her hands in the final			1
@entity2 is up next , with the match due to start ( perhaps under the roof ) at 2pm .			1
