only a week of the tennis season has gone and already an alarming number of players have been calling in sick to tournaments or withdrawing , in the case of @entity5 , because he is ' tired '			0
rising gloriously above all this is @entity7 , a player for the ages , who registered his 1,000th @entity10 victory by winning the final of the @entity12 against @entity13			1
with his 6 - 4 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 victory the 33 - year - old @entity14 became only the third player in the modern era to get into four figures of professional wins , behind @entity20 and all - time leader @entity21			1
by lifting the @entity38 trophy @entity7 was being feted again , this time with a presentation from @entity42 greats @entity40 and @entity43			2
while fans have their favourite aspects of @entity7 — his free - flowing style , for example — increasingly he is being recognised for his extraordinary durability and consistency in an era when men 's tennis is among the most physically demanding of sports			1
of all the stats being trotted out in tribute yesterday , arguably the most remarkable of his career remains the 36 consecutive times he reached the quarter - finals or ( usually ) better at the @entity60 between 2004 and 2013			2
while there are comparisons with @entity20 and @entity21 , an equally apt one is with @entity64 , the all - conquering @entity65 who was born less than two months after him			1
she stands on 684 career victories , a mark which illustrates the @entity14 master 's astonishing consistency of effort			2
@entity7 reached the landmark after seeing off @entity13 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 2/7 ) 6 - 4 in @entity42 @entity13 made life difficult for @entity7 but was eventually beaten in three sets sunday represented his 83rd career title , and hard fought it was against the huge - serving @entity77			1
it sets him up beautifully for a run at the @entity34 , which begins a week today			0
realistically you would expect him to overtake @entity20 's tally of 1,071 but even @entity7 will struggle to overhaul @entity21 's final figure of 1,253			1
they are three very different personalities , but what they have in common is an absolute lust for winning and severe dislike of losing			0
of going past @entity21 the @entity14 admitted : ' i doubt that it 's going to happen but you never know			2
' he was nonetheless delighted with this latest notch of greatness			0
' i 've played a lot of tennis over the years so to get to 1,000 wins means a lot to me , ' he said			0
only @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 have achieved more career victories than @entity7 21 — most wins against one player – @entity101 19 — most wins against current player – @entity104 22 — wins over five sets 737 — straight - set wins 1st — tour win was over @entity109 @entity108 in 1998			1
500th — tour win came in 2007 ( vs @entity110 ) 706 — next highest active player wins belong to @entity112 210 — most wins in one country : 210 in @entity65 111 — most wins against players from a country — the @entity109 @entity118 — wins on grass courts ' it 's a special moment , no doubt about that , i will never forget this match			0
looking back , it 's almost nicer winning it this way , in a final with nerves and humid conditions against a great player			0
' @entity13 was aware of the historic occasion but rather overestimated @entity7 's achievement			1
' we all know today was a significant milestone for @entity7 , ' said the world no 8			0
' when we were warming up , i heard all those titles ; i honestly thought he was playing for 2,000 match wins today ! i think he needs to step it up ! ' two thousand wins will be beyond even @entity7 , but you would expect him to get past @entity20 , on the proviso that his body and sometimes troublesome back can hold up , as it did last year but struggled to do in 2013			2
when @entity7 's second set of twins arrived in may he was asked whether they would distract him from the tennis court but he has already answered that one			1
his smooth technique puts less strain on his body than most other players and his life runs like a @entity14 clock , supported by his formidable wife @entity156 , as became apparent at the @entity157 in november			0
@entity64 was born two months after @entity7 but stands on 684 career victories the man with whom he fell out there , @entity159 , looks to have played himself into form in time for the defence of his @entity34 title			2
on sunday , he won the @entity164 by beating qualifier @entity165 6 - 3 , 6 - 4			1
by reaching the final and beating some tough @entity168 along the way @entity165 showed how useful he is , and it could yet be that by this time next week he will have switched his allegiance to @entity172 , as his change in citizenship from @entity175 appears imminent			0
@entity159 looks to have played himself into form in time for the defence of his @entity34 title @entity177 has pulled out of the forthcoming @entity34 with an arm injury @entity21 : 1,253 @entity20 : 1,071 @entity7 : 1,000 @entity179 : 929 @entity180 : 875 @entity181 : 870 @entity182 : 801 someone who will not be in @entity184 is @entity186 champion @entity185 , whose withdrawal through a shoulder injury should see @entity190 @entity189 get an automatic entry into a @entity60 field for the first time			1
@entity185 and @entity177 seem to have paid for putting in a full stint at the @entity195 in the off - season			0
@entity7 was smart enough to restrict his participation to a couple of days			0
there was good news for @entity172 in the doubles yesterday , as two players won titles			0
@entity204 ( left ) celebrates his @entity205 doubles victory in @entity30 with his partner @entity207 @entity204 made the perfect start to the season in the company of his @entity42 partner @entity211 when they defeated @entity212 and @entity213 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 in the final at @entity30			1
@entity204 wants to make a case for a return to the @entity172 @entity38 team this year			0
and 2012 wimbledon doubles champion @entity218 won his second career title in @entity221			2
he and partner @entity222 beat @entity223 and home favourite and eight - time men 's doubles @entity60 winner @entity224 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 .			1

@entity7 defeated @entity13 to earn 1,000th career win
@entity7 reached landmark after seeing off @entity13 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 2/7 ) 6 - 4
only @entity21 and @entity20 had *previously* achieved the feat
sunday 's victory was @entity7 's 83rd career title
