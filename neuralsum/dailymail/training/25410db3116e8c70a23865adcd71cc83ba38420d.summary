offended : @entity0 was told to send a demo when he offered to help on the sequel to @entity3 as the man behind the haunting theme to @entity3 , @entity0 thought he was well qualified to help out on the sequel			1
after all , his original score – @entity8 – has sold over a million copies and has become synonymous with @entity10			1
the composer , however , found his pride well and truly dented when he offered his services and was told to submit a demo tape for consideration			2
yesterday mr @entity0 said the only song he had so far heard from the sequel , @entity17 , sounded like ‘ @entity19 style pop ’ which he feared would upset fans of the first film			1
he said : ‘ there are some people who watch @entity3 every year with their whole family , so to them it is something almost sacred			0
' it ’s an icon that is part of the entire @entity10			0
it really holds a very dear place in people ’s hearts			0
’ he ’s particularly upset the follow up does not feature the original theme			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t think it can be a proper sequel without some version of @entity8			1
it could be sung by a different voice , it could be updated			0
but it ’s so much part of @entity3 that people will be expecting it			0
’ mr @entity0 , 74 , wrote walking in the @entity39 in 1970 on a beach in @entity41 after escaping from @entity42 where the pressures of a massive workload had driven him to a near breakdown			1
it was n’t until over a decade later when he was shown plans for the film of @entity3 that he realised he had the perfect musical accompaniment			0
in the 1982 film , based on the book by @entity53 , the song plays as the boy and snowman glide over the countryside			2
follow - up : a scene from @entity17			0
mr @entity0 said it would not be a proper sequel unless it had some version of walking in the @entity39 in it in the sequel , the snowdog joins them as they fly across @entity42 before heading for the @entity65 , over a new soundtrack written and recorded by former @entity68 drummer @entity67 and @entity70 composer @entity69			1
mr @entity0 , who first made his name in the sixties writing scores for tv shows , said that after being belatedly told about the new film his assistant approached the show ’s producer , @entity77 , to ask if she wanted him to write any music for it			1
he added : ‘ she said if you care to submit a demo , we ’re asking anyone who can write music to send in demos for our consideration			2
fears : mr @entity0 that the only song he had heard from the sequel sounded like @entity19 style pop original : walking in the air which featured in @entity3 ( pictured ) was originally sung by @entity96 's choirboy @entity95 ‘ i wrote a polite letter saying i do n’t do demos but if you would like me to come and look at the script you are proposing i could let you know if i might be interested in composing a score for it			1
i never had a reply			0
’ walking in the @entity39 was originally sung by @entity96 ’s choirboy @entity95			0
a version sung by @entity109 chorister @entity108 released three years later reached @entity110 5 in the charts			2
the new film will air on @entity113 over @entity10			0
a spokesman for the broadcaster said : ‘ @entity17 is a brand new sequel with an original storyline and new soundtrack			1
‘ @entity118 , who died earlier this year , produced the original film and was instrumental in getting @entity53 ’ blessing and bringing @entity17 to screen			2

@entity0 said one song from the sequel sounded like @entity19 style pop
added it could *n't* be proper sequel without some version of his original song
