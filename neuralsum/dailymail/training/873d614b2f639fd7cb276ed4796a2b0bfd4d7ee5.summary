by @entity1 reporter published : 08:05 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 8 august 2013 a failed marriage proposal that left a would - be groom mortified in front of the entire crowd at a minor league @entity8 baseball game last week was all an elaborate hoax , the team revealed this morning			1
the @entity11 uploaded video of the apparent on - field rejection on @entity14 after the game on august 2			1
since then it has taken the internet by storm , garnering some 600,000 views and prompting the question : is it a fake ? and , after failing to respond to @entity22 's calls yesterday , the @entity11 today admitted the proposal was a phoney - and the seemingly ill - fated couple , @entity24 and @entity25 , were just two employees acting out a skit			1
down on one knee : spectators were shocked when ' @entity25 ' apparently rejected her boyfriend @entity24 's public proposal @entity11 vice president of marketing @entity34 said the team 's promotions team dreamed up by the prank to entertain fans and attract wider attention to the small - scale team			1
' after watching a public proposal , we talked about what would happen if the answer were no , and how that might affect a crowd , and those viewing it after on video , ' @entity34 said			0
' we worked with two of our employees on the skit and executed a digital strategy to set the video on a viral path ; we could not be more pleased with the outcome			2
' he added : ' if anyone was offended by the promotion in any way we sincerely apologize ; this endeavor was intended to entertain and remind fans you never know what you 're going to see at a @entity11 game			1
' will you marry me @entity25 ? ' he asked			1
stepping back with her hands over her mouth , @entity25 stammered : ' @entity24 , i 'm sorry , i ca n't			1
' she then sprinted out of the stadium as the announcer laughed			0
' sorry , i do n't mean to laugh @entity24 , i do n't think we 've ever had this happen before , ' he said in the skit			1
the rejected suitor turned as red as his t - shirt as he ran out away , with the mascot still dancing around the field			0
the @entity98 speculated the proposal was a hoax , but the @entity101 reckoned the ' woman 's off - microphone reaction seems pretty real '			2
and online , opinions were mixed			0
witness , @entity105 , commented on @entity14 that he believed the proposal was legitimate			0
' i was there , my first thought was that it was fake			0
but what would the point of that be ? ' he wrote			0
' the guy worked for the team in some way , he ran in the dugout ( saw him later ) and she ran out of the stadium			0
all i can say is know the answer before asking ! ! ! ' shocked : @entity25 , stepping backward , looks distressed as she rejects @entity24 's offer			1
some believe her acting skills were lacklustre humiliating : @entity24 runs off the baseball field after @entity25 tells him she does n't want to marry him in the prank other @entity11 fans , shocked at what they witnessed , took to @entity126 to sympathize with @entity24			1
@entity127 tweeted on august 2 : ' at the # rockcats game and we witnessed a rejected , on field marriage proposal			2
the crowd gasped , the players were laughing as the girl ran off humiliated			0

he posted the image , which shows ' @entity25 ' looking decidedly uncomfortable , wringing her hands , on @entity126 with the comment : ' on field # proposal at the @ @entity146 last night , she said no and ran off			2

@entity8 's @entity11 today admitted the proposal was a phoney
*footage* *captured* the awkward moment @entity24 asked girlfriend @entity25 to marry him at a baseball game and she said ' no '
' @entity24 ' and ' @entity25 ' were actually team employees performing a skit
