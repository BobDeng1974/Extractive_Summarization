four years ago , @entity0 was paralysed in a cycling accident			1
ever since , he has been raising money for pioneering stem cell treatment which could one day help him walk again			1
but now , after collecting £ 20,000 , the 25 - year - old has given it all away – so a little boy can learn to walk instead			1
mr @entity0 abandoned his own dream after hearing about five - year - old @entity9 , who lives near him just outside @entity10 , in @entity11			1
he has to use a walking frame to get around , and his family are desperately trying to raise £ 60,000 for an operation in @entity24 to help him walk unaided for the first time			1
mr @entity0 , who is wheelchair - bound , said he made the extraordinary gesture because @entity9 had a better chance of walking than he does			1
‘ i know for me that things are n’t going to get better any time soon , ’ he said			0
‘ i just wanted to do something that could help someone whose life could get better			0
‘ @entity9 can definitely walk if he has the surgery			1
i would n’t wish being paralysed on anyone , so if i can help someone walk , i will			0
’ @entity0 ( pictured before his accident ) was paralysed from the chest down when he was knocked off his bicycle in 2009			1
he also suffered a stroke which denied him use of one arm mr @entity0 raised £ 20,000 to pay for stem cell treatment but he then gave all of the money to @entity9 ( pictured with his parents @entity45 and @entity46 ) who has cerebral palsy he continued : ‘ while there is hope for @entity9 , i will do everything i can , because i do n’t want to see a young boy suffer			1
‘ i ’m incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped me out but this boy needs it more than i do at the moment			0
‘ it would make me very happy to see the difference made to @entity9 ’s life			2
i just hope when i give the money it encourages others to [ give ]			0
’ the treatment mr @entity0 was hoping to get is in development			1
while there has been progress in trials abroad , it would be at least five years before he could be helped			0
mr @entity0 was knocked off his bike by a car in 2009 , as he cycled to work at @entity70			1
he broke a vertebrae which left him paralysed from the chest down			0
he also suffered a stroke as he recovered in hospital , which left him without the use of his right arm			1
he requires 24 - hour care at his home in @entity80 , near @entity10 , which costs £ 180,000 a year			2
the family will use the money to pay for @entity83 to have surgery in the @entity24 the treatment should allow him to take his first unaided steps and to run around with his friends mr @entity0 ( pictured before his accident ) says that he made the decision because the surgery will make more difference to @entity83 that stem cell treatment would to him mr @entity0 ( pictured before his accident ) needs round - the - clock care and knows that stem cell treatment is his only hope of walking			1
even if it could help him , he would not be able to have treatment for five years @entity9 was born with two dislocated hips			1
he was put in a pelvic harness at five days old , and had had three operations by the time he was 13 months			0
mr @entity0 's mother , @entity102 , said : ' that little boy needs to be out playing football with his friends in the sunshine , not at home asking his mummy why he ca n't			2
i 'm so proud of @entity109 ' his family , from the nearby village of @entity112 , are desperately trying to find £ 60,000 to send him to @entity24 for a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy			1
his mother @entity115 , 44 , described mr @entity0 ’s £ 20,000 gift as ‘ phenomenal ’			1
the family had already raised just over £ 11,000 , so they now have more than half of the £ 60,000			2
she said : ‘ what @entity0 has done is brilliant			2
so many people have helped @entity83 and we are grateful to them all			2
’ @entity9 ’s father @entity123 , also 44 , added : ‘ @entity0 has given us a phenomenal amount of money			1
i do n’t think it is even possible to say how grateful we are , or to put into words what it means			0
how do you even start saying thank you for something like that ? ’ yesterday mr @entity0 ’s mother @entity102 said : ‘ it ’s heartwarming what @entity109 has done			2
it ’s crazy that that young lad @entity9 could be able to walk , if he had the money			2
‘ @entity109 ca n’t walk , not right now , and he accepts that			0
that little boy needs to be out playing football with his friends in the sunshine , not at home asking his mummy why he ca n’t			0
i ’m so proud of @entity109			0
’ to donate to @entity9 's charity fund , please visit @entity145 selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			2
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be ' transmitting ' properly are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			0
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			0

@entity0 , 25 , was paralysed when he was knocked off his bike in 2009
also suffered a stroke which caused him to lose use of his right arm
raised £ 20,000 to pay for stem cell treatment which could help him recover
gave all the money to family of @entity9 , 5 , who has cerebral palsy
will be used to help pay for surgery in the @entity24 - this should enable @entity83 to take his first unaided steps
