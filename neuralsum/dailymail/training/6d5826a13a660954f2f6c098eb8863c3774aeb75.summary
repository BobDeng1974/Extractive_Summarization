when you are in a helicopter , it only takes a heartbeat for your mood to change from awe to dread			1
lifting off from the southern tip of @entity8 had been electrifying , with the @entity10 rollers crashing in on the coast to the right , and the azure @entity13 caressing the shore to the left			1
the knotted green expanse of the rainforest came up fast ahead , and we were on the hunt for the @entity26 parrot , our eyes raking the trees for a flash of green that would identify a bird found nowhere else on earth			1
a place among the palms : @entity8 offers splendid beaches , including the sands of @entity32 suddenly , clouds rolled over us as the highest peak loomed ever larger			1
first there were breaks in the gloom , and then ... nothing			1
we could see perhaps 20ft in any direction			2
where on earth was that mountain ? but just as panic was creeping over us , the cloud broke and there was the rainforest below			1
minutes later we were touching down at a seaside airport on the west coast , buoyed by a sheer rush of adrenaline			2
we 'd saved an hour in a minibus , and experienced a ride that would make @entity53 weep with jealousy			2
ten minutes later , we were swinging through the gates of @entity56 , a 60 - acre estate with about 160 apartments and villas that cascade up and down vertiginous hillsides dotted with calabash and almond trees , with views across an unbroken expanse of ocean to the western horizon			2
a picture of @entity13 perfection : @entity68 sits on the island 's west coast , in sight of the famous @entity72 we could feel ourselves starting to slough off the cares of the world the minute we arrived			1
but then how many hotels come with their own resident humming birds ? elusive : @entity79 failed to spot the @entity80 on a verdant wall next to the reception , we watched rapt as these miniature miracles darted from flower to flower , the exquisite greens and blues of their feathers a blur of motion			2
when i told our ten - year - old son that we could go on a speedboat ride and then snorkel , he took a deep breath and said : ' ok , let 's do it			2
' which is how we found ourselves skimming across @entity100 with the impossibly laid - back @entity101 at the tiller			0
when we arrived at the dive site , after a few words of guidance - ' do n't tread on the fire coral cos it 's really gon na sting ' - we plunged into what felt like a warm bath , and discovered a world of wonders			0
on the seabed , we spotted a moray eel , its bulbous head poking out of the sand , floating lazily with the current for all the world like a piece of seaweed , but with death lurking in its shadow			0
in the deeper water of next - door @entity32 , down to a depth of 20ft or so , we found the conch shell graveyard , an eerie wasteland of hundreds of giant shells , tossed overboard by the fishermen who bring in their catch from deeper waters			1
if morning dives were boys ' time , afternoons were all about the lunatic that passes for my seven - year - old daughter going just a little crazy at the watersports beach			0
you can waterski or potter about on a pedalo			0
but we just wanted a ride on the @entity141 , a huge inflatable that seats eight and rockets along behind a speed boat , bobbing and crashing like a deranged cork across the wake			0
after that , it was usually time for a bowl of all - inclusive ice cream and a cocktail ( non-alcoholic for her , restorative for me ) at the @entity155 beachside restaurant , the most relaxed of the five eateries in the resort , where you 'll find a thumping reggae beat and a ready smile any day of the week			0
it 's about £ 120 a day for all - inclusive ( and £ 70 each for the children ) , which covers breakfast , lunch , dinner , snacks and soft drinks			0
this is n't a cheap holiday by any means , but sitting at @entity155 watching the sun set over the @entity173 with a 14 x 61 cocktail at your elbow ( named after @entity8 's latitude and longitude ) is almost beyond price			1
making a splash : the @entity56 resort offer an exciting range of water sports we could have spent the week on the beach , playing giant chess and beach cricket			1
but that elusive @entity188 parrot was nagging at us , so one morning we took a drive up to the rainforest that spreads thickly across the centre of the island			1
stretching up far into the trees is a network of cable cars that carried us through the huge tree ferns and vast buttress root systems of the @entity198			0
i nearly gave into temptation and let out a @entity202 roar , but had to satisfy myself with watching the chicken hawks swooping above , the bright @entity205 butterflies darting among the trees and keeping a narrowed eye out for the slither of a boa constrictor below			0
but still no sign of that pesky parrot			0
@entity8 's motto is ' the land , the people , the light ' , and this is the place where the @entity217 - winning poet @entity216 has spent a lifetime capturing its unique beauty			1
you can have a slice of it , too			0
just do n't expect to see any of those parrots			0
seven nights room - only at @entity56 with @entity225 ( 020 7751 0660 , www.caribtours.co.uk ) costs from £ 1,109 per person , based on two adults and two children sharing a two - bedroom ocean - view room			0
the price includes return flights , private transfers and lounge passes at @entity235 .			1

the transfers buzzes across glorious rainforest *scenery* and high *terrain*
@entity8 is great for water sports , with scuba diving especially *popular*
