by @entity0 @entity2 's wife boasted in a gushing interview of how he did all the chores around the house and was the ' best husband he could be ' - not knowing that all the while , he was sexting his online mistress			1
the couple invited @entity10 into their home in july 2012 for the first in - depth interview since @entity2 resigned from @entity13 the year before			1
@entity14 said she did so , because photographers were still stationed outside their home , ' as if we should have something to hide ' - words which have undoubtedly come back to haunt her in wake of the recent scandal			1
' @entity2 would be the first to tell you that he regrets the mistakes that he made and he has spent every single day since then trying to be the best dad he can be , the best husband he can be and it shows , ' she said			2
devoted daddy : @entity2 said quiet time with his son at 3am helped turn him into a different person ' i consider myself very lucky to be married to him			1
i 'm proud to be married to him , i want @entity65 to be proud of who his father is			0
' we 're a happy family			1
we 're a couple in love and have a baby boy who is a reflection of that love and i want people to know that			0
i just want people to know we 're a normal family			2
' she continued to tell @entity10 how @entity2 does all the chores around the house as well as the 3am baby shift			1
though it appeared all of his time was spent on acting like husband of the year , the disgraced politician still managed to squeeze in some extra-curricular activities outside of laundry duty - this was when he started his online affair with @entity92			1
' i have not washed a single piece of clothing ever			0
@entity2 does all our laundry			2
i have not been to our dry cleaner			0
he does that , ' @entity14 boasted			1
' he makes my tea when i get up in the morning			0
he 's just a loving , caring , thoughtful spouse and partner			0
' looking ever the devoted father and husband in the accompanying photo shoot , @entity2 said : ' every day since this has happened , i 've tried to become a better person , a husband that @entity14 deserves and as good a father as i can be			1
' last week , he admitted that his more than six - month virtual relationship began at the same time and has attributed his behavior to a ' rough patch ' in their relationship - a far cry from the united front they put on for the magazine			1
' the fact is that it was the time that my wife and i were working through some things in our marriage			2
' he said during a press conference last week			2
' it was a terrible mistake that i unfortunately returned to during a rough time in our marriage			1
' happily ever after - not quite : @entity2 and his wife @entity125 on their wedding day on july 10 , 2010 husband of the year : @entity2 picks up his wife 's dry cleaning one year after his first sexting scandal as @entity14 gushes he is the ' best husband he can be ' standing by her man : @entity2 had been mounting a successful campaign for @entity26 mayor - with wife @entity14 by his side - until new sexting allegations emerged the mayoral candidate also mused in the @entity40 interview how much cradling his son at 3am gave him a sense of still and calmness he never had before			1
' i learned that i always had a great sense of where i was going and how to get there next but i did n’t have a good sense of just sitting and being and feeling and having a sense of peace			0
' that 's not my m.o			0
of all the adjectives you could use to describe @entity2 , " still " would n't be one of them			2
i really do feel like a very , very different person			0
' but , unfortunately for @entity14 , for the next six months he engaged in lewd online conversations with the 23 - year - old political student , exchanged explicit pictures and even promised to set her up in a @entity49 condo so they could meet in person			1
though their interactions started to peter out by @entity166 , she revealed he contacted her as recently as april			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity169 at the weekend , @entity46 unashamedly lifted the lid on @entity2 's depraved and bizarre sexual fantasies , and how he sighed : ' oh baby , i want to suck your toes ' , while demanding photos of her feet in high heel shoes			1
the man she said she once put up on a pedestal , she now brands as a ‘ narcissist ’ , adding : ‘ i do n’t think he ’s an ethical man			0
i do n’t think he ’s an honest man or a trustworthy man			0
i certainly do n’t think he should be the mayor of @entity26			0
' he would say all sorts of things , and wanted me wearing high heels and nothing else , ’ she said			0
' for some reason , he just wanted me to be in heels all the time			0
