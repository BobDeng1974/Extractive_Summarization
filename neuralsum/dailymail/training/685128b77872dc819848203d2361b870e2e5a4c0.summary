by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:18 est , 5 december 2013 parents should not let their baby share their bed because it increases the risk of sudden infant death , experts have warned			1
health officials in @entity11 are so worried about the practice that they have issued new guidance to highlight the dangers			0
bed - sharing between parents and infants is widespread in the country - but this can put newborns at risk			1
parents should not let their baby share their bed because it increases the risk of sudden infant death ' it 's important that children under three months sleep in their own beds , ' said @entity28 , of the @entity29			1
she said the recommendation was ' new ' , since the institution had previously only advised against new - borns sleeping in the same room as a smoker , or in the same bed as a parent under the influence of drugs or alcohol			1
the information was first published by @entity11 medical newspaper @entity41 , which cited a paediatrics professor at @entity43			0
' it has been clear in the research in recent years that co-sleeping is a risk factor in @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , ' professor @entity44 told the paper			0
a 2001 study published in the paediatric journal @entity53 showed that 65 per cent of three - month - old @entity11 babies slept with their parents , the highest rate in the western world			2
a report published by the @entity59 , which analysed nearly 1,500 sudden infant deaths , revealed that 22 per cent took place while the baby slept in the parental bed			2
the @entity29 says it is vital that babies sleep in their own bed until they are at least three months old according to professor of medical statistics @entity70 , who was responsible for the study , the risk of sudden infant death among babies sleeping with their parents is five times higher than in those who sleep alone			1
other countries , including @entity75 and the @entity76 , recommend sleeping in the same room as the new - born , but not in the same bed			2
@entity49 is the unexpected , sudden death of a child under the age of one in which an autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death			0
it is also known as cot death			1
almost all @entity49 deaths occur without warning or symptoms when the infant is thought to be sleeping			0
some recommendations to prevent sids include putting the baby to sleep on its back , with enough space to move , avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke and making sure they are not too hot .			0

the @entity29 says babies under three months old should always sleep in their own bed to *reduce* cot death risk
previously the board only said babies should not share a room with a smoker and that they should not share a bed with a drunk parent
cot death is five times more likely if baby is sharing a bed with its parents
