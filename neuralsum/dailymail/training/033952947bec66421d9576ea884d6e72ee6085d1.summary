looking at pictures of @entity3 posing confidently in just her underwear , it 's hard to believe she was once so shy , she would have a panic attack if she met people she did n't know			1
the 23 - year - old from @entity9 used to hate people looking at her and became too scared to leave the house because she feared socialising			2
@entity3 's nervousness was so extreme , she would have sleepless nights worrying about having to travel for work on public transport and could be reduced to tears in business meetings			1
confident : @entity3 is now a model after having hynosis to cure her anxiety problems ca n't stop me now ! the 23 - year - old once hated leaving the house but now she has become a confident lingerie model after overcoming her crippling anxiety thanks to the power of hypnosis			1
@entity3 explained : ' i used to have frequent anxiety and panic attacks , which were really severe and developed when i had to travel for work			1
' if i had to travel somewhere for work in the morning i would be up the whole night before crying and worrying			0
' it got to the stage when i was anxious to step out of my front door and it killed my social life			2
i would make up any excuse not to leave the house			0
i 'd tell my boss and my friends that i was ill and i could n't go out			0
inhibiting : @entity3 said she used to have panic attacks and worried about travelling for her job with a jewellers no inhibitions : now she 's so confident she 's happy to show off her body in selfies ' i have always been quite reserved and doubted myself a lot but after having to travel for work , it escalated in way i could never have imagined			1
' @entity3 had always dreamed of being a model but knew it would never be a reality because of her lack of confidence and anxiety			1
' i entered into a beauty contest when i was seven and loved it			0
but as i grew up i did n't have the confidence to think about doing it properly , ' she said			0
' i would constantly worry that i was n't good enough and be paranoid about what people would think of me			0
i was very unconfident and shy , and just could n't deal with unfamiliar situations			0
' it got to the stage where i was constantly crying , not sleeping and eating and finding myself unable to breathe			0
' @entity3 worked as a visual merchandisers for a jewellery company and had to travel for up to a week at a time to different stores across the @entity67			1
the model says she can now pursue her dream career thanks to having hypnosis she said : ' i 'd worry about the entire journey from getting on the train , travelling to an unfamiliar place , having to hold leadership over staff and stores i did n't feel comfortable in , before proceeding on these journeys i would cry for days in advance and struggled to sleep			2
' the more i had to travel , the more my panic escalated , i even broke down in tears a few times when i was away and whilst i was on the shop floor , when a panic attack hit , i 'd struggle to breathe and felt like i was losing control of my own feelings and mind			2
' her anxiety was so bad , she began getting in trouble at work when she would call in sick or make excuses not to go , and eventually her bosses agreed she would n't have to travel			2
but @entity3 was still struggling to leave the house and was at her lowest ebb so she decided to give hypnotherapist @entity94 , from @entity9 , a call			1
transformed : she used to avoid going to unknown places and meeting new people but now loves socialising @entity3 spent Â£ 360 on eight hypnotherapy sessions with @entity94 at his clinic , @entity101 , in @entity9 and he helped her address her deep rooted self - esteem issues and through breathing and visualisation techniques			1
she said : ' i was sceptical at first but i had nothing to lose			0
i was so down and stressed it was worth a shot			0
' i was actually amazed at the change i felt after the sessions - it was like @entity94 had completely changed my outlook and mental attitude			0
' @entity3 has overcome her anxiety and now is confident enough to pose in underwear - after finally being able to pursue her dream of being a hosiery model			1
look at me ! once she hated being looked at but now she loves to show off her body @entity3 now travels to photoshoots across the country with no problems and has no inhibitions about flashing some flesh in racy lingerie and stocking sets			1
she said : ' i absolutely love it and ca n't believe how i have turned my life around			1
twelve months ago i would never have thought i would be confident and comfortable enough to leave the house and travel to see a photographer , and then strip off			2
' i have received such positive feedback for my modelling and it has really given me the boost i needed			0
' before hypnotherapy i was unable to leave to house , but now i am travelling across the country and posing in these amazing underwear sets - and i am absolutely loving it			0
