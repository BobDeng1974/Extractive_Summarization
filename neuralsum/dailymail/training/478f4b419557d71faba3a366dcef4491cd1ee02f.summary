by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 28 april 2013 @entity1 was on holiday in @entity3 when he died			1
there were no warning signs that anything was wrong – indeed , he seemed to be in perfect health			0
but his heart simply stopped beating			1
‘ he was sitting on the bed , texting , and that was it			0
it was like switching off a light , ’ explains his sister @entity10			0
she was told about the harrowing events later by @entity1 ’s two best friends who were with him			1
‘ they called for help and a nurse was there within minutes , but there was no hope			0
‘ waiting at @entity32 for @entity34 ’s luggage , but knowing he would n’t be coming through the doors too , was perhaps the hardest thing i have ever done			2
i just felt as if i could n’t possibly go on			0
’ after a post-mortem failed to determine a definite cause , the tragedy in july 2008 was attributed to @entity42 ( @entity22 ) , a catch - all term for an undiagnosed heart condition			1
shockingly , the syndrome kills 12 @entity45 aged between 14 and 35 every week			1
in 1992 , @entity46 , the son of former @entity48 footballer @entity47 and the brother of tv presenter @entity50 , died from an undiagnosed heart condition aged 15 while playing in his garden			1
tragic event : @entity1 , pictured with friends as a teenager , died while on holiday in @entity3 in 2008 @entity58 footballer @entity57 died on the pitch during an international match in @entity61 in 2003 , while @entity63 captain @entity62 also collapsed and died during a game against @entity65 in 2007			1
and just three months ago , @entity66 , a teenage swimming star tipped to represent @entity67 at the @entity68 in @entity69 , died at her home in @entity71 after going into cardiac arrest			2
like 25 - year - old @entity1 , they were all extremely fit , making their deaths all the more unfathomable			1
aside from being an adored son and brother , @entity1 was also carving out a successful property career , had a flat in @entity79 , @entity80 , and planned to marry his girlfriend			1
‘ @entity34 was extremely intelligent – he got straight as at school and achieved a top 2:1 in his economics degree from @entity85 , ’ says @entity10 , a financial manager from @entity82			0
‘ he was the life and soul of the party , stupidly good - looking and incredibly caring			0
’ in the months after @entity1 ’s death , the @entity1 family ’s collective grief manifested itself in various ways			1
‘ i thought i felt my heart break – a sharp , physical pain i ’d never experienced before , ’ @entity10 says			2
‘ how could i go on without my gorgeous little brother ? shock : @entity1 , right as a child , was a fit and healthy young man when his heart suddenly stopped beating ‘ previously , whenever anything had gone wrong in my life , i would turn to my parents , but they were suffering too			1
we were united , yet i felt incredibly alone			0
as a sibling , there was a very particular sense of desperation and loneliness			0
’ help was at hand from @entity110 ( @entity110 ) , a charity set up in 1995 to help prevent @entity22 through better screening			1
the charity ’s teams visit schools and sports clubs across the country , offering simple heart - monitoring scans that can flag up abnormalities			2
it also provides support for families in mourning thanks to volunteers who train to become accredited counsellors			0
most recently , @entity110 launched a new service aimed at helping siblings of @entity22 victims			1
‘ when someone loses a brother or sister , there ’s a very real risk of implosion because they ’re not prepared to make themselves – or their pain – heard , ’ says @entity110 founder @entity129			1
professor @entity139 , consultant cardiologist at @entity140 , believes the best way to prevent @entity22 is to offer screening using an echocardiogram ( @entity144 ) , a painless test that detects electrical or rhythm problems with the heartbeat			2
‘ there may be no warning signs at all , ’ he says			0
‘ but an unexplained collapse or blackout , a family history of sudden death in the young , or sustained palpitations – more than a few seconds of feeling your heart race – could be an indicator			0
’ dr @entity158 , a consultant in emergency medicine at @entity160 of @entity161 , has been campaigning for better awareness of @entity22 for a decade			2
‘ most cases have a genetic origin , ’ she explains			0
‘ cases tend to come to light in teenagers and those in their early 20s , as the heart grows and matures			0
frequently we hear about @entity22 happening during sport when the heart beats faster and harder , and may also suffer slightly low oxygen levels			1
‘ if a person already has an abnormal heart structure or a genetic problem with the electrical conduction , exercise may trigger the heart to go into an abnormal rhythm and , in the worst case , a cardiac arrest			0
’ @entity10 , who is now a long - term @entity110 volunteer , devotes much of her time to spreading this message in a bid to save other families from the same anguish she still experiences			2
‘ the hardest time for me is january because @entity34 ’s birthday was the day after mine			0
these days , i prefer to lie low and instead of gifts , i ask everyone to donate to @entity110			2
that ’s the best possible present because it ’s for him too			0
