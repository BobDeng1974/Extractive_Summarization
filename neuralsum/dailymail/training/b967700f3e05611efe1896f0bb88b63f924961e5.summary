the government ’s £ 130billion help to buy scheme could ‘ inflate the market ’ and push property prices even further out of reach of young families , said the business secretary			1
it launches next year and is designed to help more people get on the housing ladder by providing lower deposits and loans guaranteed by the taxpayer			1
clash : chancellor @entity3 ( left ) claims the scheme will help more people on to the property ladder and encourage a wave of new housebuilding but @entity1 ( right ) voiced concerns of a house price boom but @entity28 mr @entity1 said he shared the concerns of experts who warn that it could artificially raise house prices by making it easier to get a large mortgage			1
he told @entity37 ’s @entity36 programme : ‘ well i did warn about it and i am worried of the danger of getting into another housing bubble			2
’ mr @entity1 said the scheme could be a ‘ useful addition ’ if it was ‘ properly designed ’ but added : ‘ it could be a problem - it could inflate the market			1
‘ we must n’t risk returning to the problems of the last decade when housing got out of control			0
’ the business secretary said the real problem was a lack of housing and claimed the current building rate of about 100,000 homes a year was ‘ hopelessly inadequate ’			1

there were 120,000 new homeowners in the first half of the year – a rise of a fifth in 12 months and the biggest number since a peak of 181,500 in 2007			0
but a surge in house prices means 51 per cent of first - time buyers are buying properties within the £ 125,000 stamp duty threshold – up from 44 per cent in a year , says the @entity93			1
but warnings have been issued by experts , including former @entity97 governor lord king			0

its chief economist @entity100 said : ‘ the world must have gone mad for us to now be discussing endless taxpayer guarantees for mortgages			0

’ there have also been concerns that the scheme could be exploited by migrants from the @entity113			0
in a wide - ranging interview , mr @entity1 responded to concerns over the viability of a high speed rail link between @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120 following news that its projected cost has soared by £ 10billion to more than £ 40billion			0
