beneath all that fur , she may have the healthy glow of an expectant mum ... but things are seldom that black and white with panda pregnancy			0
so @entity6 , @entity7 ’s only female giant panda , was placed under 24 - hour surveillance – and her keepers put on ‘ red alert ’ – yesterday after tests suggested she is expecting			1
any new arrival would be the first panda cub to be born here			2
they even have access to @entity30 footage via their smartphones and laptops so they can monitor her from their homes to ensure they do n’t miss a beat			0
if @entity6 , whose name means @entity42 , is carrying a baby , the pitter - patter of tiny paws could be heard any time in the next two weeks – and it might even be twins			1
as excitement grew yesterday at perhaps the most anticipated birth since @entity48 ’s , she seemed to revel in keeping everyone guessing			0
@entity6 has been relaxes in her ' off show area ' at @entity51 today after experts announced there is a high chance she is pregnant she even stuck her tongue out at the crowds at @entity51 , where she lives with partner @entity57 , whose name means @entity58 ( he was n’t revealing much either , just eating bamboo and sleeping a lot as usual )			1
visitor @entity62 , 22 , from @entity63 , said : ‘ she looked so serene , and it looked like she was smiling			0
then she stuck her tongue out			0
it was as if she was saying , “ i ’m giving nothing away ”			0
’ pandas are notoriously picky about mating and , unfortunately , sparks failed to fly between @entity6 and @entity57 , both aged eight , following their arrival in 2011 after a 5,000 - mile flight from @entity72 , which is loaning them to @entity7			1
they will stay at the zoo until 2021 and are expected to generate £ 47million in tourist income for the @entity78 economy			2
the female giant panda rests at @entity51 zoo today in preparation for what could be the first birth of a giant panda in the @entity7 but under the agreement that brought them here , any cubs are the property of the @entity72 and will be taken to @entity72 at the age of two , the age they would naturally leave their mother in the wild			1
@entity6 was artificially inseminated in april using some of @entity57 ’s sperm , and some frozen sperm from @entity96 , a ‘ genetically important ’ member of their endangered species who died at @entity100 last year			1
@entity102 foetuses do not start to develop until the final weeks of the five - month gestation period , and at birth the cubs weigh on average only 5oz – 1/900th of their mother ’s weight – so there is nothing so simple as a ‘ baby bump ’ to judge a pregnancy by			2
there is a chance @entity6 , seen roaming her @entity51 enclosure today , could reject the foetuses or that her body could reabsorb them @entity57 enjoys his free time at @entity51 while @entity6 , who is possible pregnant , rests in her ' off show area ' after @entity57 and @entity6 failed to mate naturally , experts artificially inseminated the female giant panda with @entity57 's semen so the cub or cubs will still be his instead , tests on @entity6 ’s urine revealed a high level of the hormone progesterone			1
this indicates she is pregnant , a zoo spokesman said , but it could equally mean she is undergoing a ‘ phantom pregnancy ’			2
the spokesman added that even if she is pregnant there is a possibility she may not carry to full term and her body may reject any foetuses			2
her keepers have spotted her displaying nesting behaviour , looking sluggish and sleeping for up to 16 hours a day , all indications she may be pregnant			0
but no one will know for sure until she starts going into labour			0
@entity142 , director of giant pandas for the @entity144 , said : ‘ if indeed she is pregnant , this is an extremely risky time for panda pregnancies			0
’ despite the lack of certainty , staff are planning for a birth – incubators have arrived at the zoo and @entity72 panda keeper @entity153 , from the @entity154 and @entity155 , has flown to @entity51 to assist			1
@entity102 express : @entity6 and @entity57 arrive in @entity51 on december 4 , 2011 on a @entity156 777f @entity57 and @entity6 settled in quickly at @entity51 zoo when they arrived in december 2011 @entity57 celebrates his 10th birthday in @entity51 where he was brought as a cub with @entity6 @entity6 is resting in her off show area at @entity51 ahead of the suspected labour			1
her cubbing box is located in the private enclosure at the zoo the arrival of @entity57 ( pictured ) and @entity6 in @entity51 two years ago has done wonders for the economy as well as aiding @entity78 's relationship with @entity72 , it is claimed the cub or cubs will stay in @entity51 until it is two and then return to @entity72			1
it is at the same age when @entity102 are traditionally released into the wild			0

@entity6 's most recent hormone tests showed she could be pregnant
experts at @entity51 on *constant* baby watch for signs of labour
artificially inseminated in april after failing to mate with @entity57
if born , cub will stay in @entity51 until it is two then return to @entity72
