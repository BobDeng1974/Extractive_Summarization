the @entity0 returned with a bang over the weekend , with spectacular goals , thrilling football , moments of controversy and some late drama			1
we 've watched all of the 26 goals again - with a little help from our friends at @entity12 - and here 's the full breakdown of how they were scored			1
paying the penalty the opening weekend saw three penalties awarded in the 10 games , with one scored and two missed			1
@entity19 slotted home to open the scoring for @entity22 against @entity23 after referee @entity24 had adjudged @entity25 to have tangled a little too closely with @entity26			0
going down : @entity26 fell under contact from @entity23 defender @entity25 , leading referee @entity24 to award @entity22 a penalty spot on : @entity19 confidently converts the penalty , sending @entity29 the wrong way out of character : @entity32 missed his penalty for @entity34 against @entity35 at @entity36 , @entity32 fired wide from 12 yards - his first penalty miss in 10 - as @entity34 went down 1 - 0 to @entity35 in the @entity39 derby			1
and @entity40 had a @entity0 debut to forget when @entity42 saved his spot - kick at @entity44			2
there were three penalty goals on the opening day last season and five the season prior to that			1
set - piece specialists they are the spectacular goals that get us on our feet , but there were no goals direct from free - kicks on the opening weekend			1
this is in contrast to last season 's first weekend , when two were scored - @entity58 rifled home for @entity64 against @entity65 and @entity66 curled one in for @entity68 against @entity69			2
some came close , like @entity71 , who curled one against the outside of the post in @entity75 's defeat by @entity76 , or the fan who ran 70 yards across the pitch to take one at @entity36			0
so close : @entity71 struck the outside of the post with this free - kick in @entity75 's loss to @entity76 good effort : a fan runs on to the pitch to take a free - kick during the @entity34 vs @entity35 game inside and outside the box the vast majority of the weekend 's goals ( 24 ) were tucked away from inside the penalty box , with just two scored from outside			1
this is a low count compared to recent form - there were six long - range hits on the opening day last season and five the year before that			1
it perhaps demonstrates a trend of working the ball into the box with passing , rather than shooting from range			0
there was @entity106 's superb 25 - yard strike for @entity23 at @entity22 and @entity108 's curled effort from just outside the area to give @entity76 the lead at @entity111			0
fine strike : @entity106 lets fly with a 25 yard shot to open the scoring for @entity23 at @entity22 cool finish : @entity108 curls the ball home to put @entity76 ahead at @entity111 @entity118 the opening round saw three headed goals and , in a trend that maybe shows the decline of high crossing in favour of passing moves and all of them came from set - piece situations			2
at @entity44 , @entity65 defender @entity129 won a battle of strength with @entity132 to head home @entity135 's corner and settle the contest			0
the other two came 10 minutes apart at the @entity138 - @entity137 was left unmarked to meet a @entity140 corner and give @entity141 the lead , before @entity143 bent his run to get in behind the defence and nod in @entity148 's free - kick to equalise			1
four headed goals were scored this time last year			0
heading for victory : @entity129 ( right ) beats @entity152 defender @entity132 to the ball and score towering : @entity137 rises above the @entity156 defence to head @entity141 in front on saturday twist : @entity143 scores with his head to bring @entity156 level at the @entity138 which foot ? 16 of the 26 came with the right foot and seven with the left			0
both of @entity76 's goals came off the left boot , @entity108 sweeping home and @entity168 slotting home the late winner			0
@entity171 also slotted home after rounding goalkeeper @entity172 to score @entity35 's late winner at @entity34			0
on the left : @entity171 rounds @entity34 keeper @entity172 to score @entity35 's winner at @entity36 passing stats the weekend underlined once again how @entity179 football 's top flight has thrown aside the traditional long ball game in favour of short and precise passing			2
87.48 per cent of attempted passes in the 10 matches were short - 7,951 in total - with just 1,138 over a longer range			1
this stat has remained consistently in the high eighties for the last three or four seasons now			0
the best example was , of course , @entity192 's magnificent goal for @entity64 at @entity193			0
this comprised 23 passes , working the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , before @entity199 played the final killer ball into @entity192 to finish with aplomb			2
team work : @entity192 's goal for @entity64 at @entity193 featured 24 passes in the build - up cool finish : the @entity207 gets on the end of @entity199 ' defence - splitting ball to score back to front : our @entity211 diagram showing the intricate passing for @entity192 's goal video positive reaction a plus for @entity217 total goals the 26 goals scored is one more than this time last year but some way short of the 33 racked up on the opening weekend of the 2006 - 2007 season , helped by @entity75 's 5 - 1 thrashing of @entity224 and @entity226 's 3 - 2 home win over @entity227			1
the lowest in the last decade came in 2011 - 2012 with just 18 scored and three goalless draws .			0

the opening weekend of the season saw 26 goals scored in @entity0
three penalties were awarded - one scored and two missed
there were no goals scored directly from free - kicks and just two from outside the penalty area
three headers found the net in opening 10 games of the season
87.48 per cent of passes were short , *signalling* end of long - ball tactics
