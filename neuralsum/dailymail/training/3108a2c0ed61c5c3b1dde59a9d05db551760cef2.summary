a high court judge has criticised justice secretary @entity1 after prison inmates were unable to attend the ' healthy sex ' courses that were key to their release			1
mr @entity6 , sitting in @entity7 , allowed legal challenges brought by three prisoners serving indeterminate sentences who face long delays before they can get on the programme			1
the judge said the justice secretary had breached his duty to provide such resources for jailed sex offenders , whose progress towards release from prison was ' effectively impossible ' without attending the courses			1
criticism : high court judge mr @entity6 ( left ) has criticised justice secretary @entity1 ( right ) after prison inmates were unable to attend the ' healthy sex ' courses that were key to their release he said more than 140 other inmates were also immediately affected by the problem			1
the judge said the cases raised an important issue about the extent to which the justice secretary 's public law duty could be modified by the level of resources he made available for offenders still serving indeterminate sentences for public protection ( @entity37 )			1
he ruled : ' the secretary of state is not entitled to overlook the public law duty by pointing to inadequate resources ...			2
' if @entity42 retains sentences of @entity37 for these claimants , as it has done and is entitled to do so , the secretary of state has a duty to provide resources to discharge the public law duty			2
' the heavily criticised @entity37 system was abolished in 2012 but many inmates sentenced earlier are still caught up in the @entity37 regime			1
under the @entity37 system courts imposed a minimum period which had to be served before offenders became eligible for consideration for release			0
' @entity56 ' : in 2009 the @entity57 upheld a @entity59 declaration that the then justice secretary , @entity61 's @entity60 , was acting unlawfully by failing to make provision in @entity37 cases the judge said the justice secretary was under a duty to provide resources to allow @entity37 inmates to demonstrate to the @entity69 by the time their prison tariffs expired that it was no longer necessary to keep them locked up for public protection			1
he said the three applicants for judicial review , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , had served their @entity37 tariffs			0
@entity74 was convicted in 2008 of threatening to kill a child and sentenced to an @entity37 with a minimum tariff of 20 months			0
@entity75 was sentenced in 2009 to an @entity37 with a three - year tariff for a sexual offence and assault occasioning actual bodily harm			0
@entity76 , who was nearly 73 years old , had a history of sex offences and was sentenced in august 2007 to an ipp with a tariff of two - and - a - half years			0
the judge said all three category c prisoners had waited at least two years for the healthy sex programme course which was critical to their chances of release			1
however , the earliest any of them was predicted to access the course was a further six to 18 months from the date of today 's judgment			0
the latest was up to three - and - a - half years - at least five years after a recommendation that the inmate go on the course			0
the judge said the justice secretary accepted he was under a public law duty to make provision for the three applicants , but contended it had been discharged ' having regard to the available resources '			2
in 2009 the @entity57 upheld a @entity59 declaration that the then justice secretary , @entity61 's @entity60 , was acting unlawfully by failing to make provision in @entity37 cases			0
other problems arose of delay and failing to ensure prisoners progressed through the @entity37 system , leading to the abolition of @entity37			0
but prisoners like the claimants not yet released were still subject to the @entity37 regime , and the justice secretary was continuing to act in breach of his public law duty .			2

mr @entity6 allowed legal challenges brought by three prisoners
all have indeterminate sentences and must attend ' healthy sex ' courses
however , they face long delays before they can get on the courses
judge says release from prison was ' effectively impossible ' without classes
indeterminate sentences for public protection were abolished in 2012
inmates should be able to demonstrate to @entity69 that it is no longer necessary to keep them locked up for public protection , says judge
