abandoned , rusting and desolate , the hulking remnants of these old bangers have been claimed by nature			0
@entity4 photographer @entity3 travelled the world to find vintage cars left to crumble in leafy forests and fields			1
he came across a range of mysterious graveyards hosting all sorts of vehicles , including a rare @entity13 , which , if restored , could be worth £ 82,000 , and a fleet of vehicles used by the @entity16 in the @entity17			1
many of the cars , often with doors , tires or windows missing , are parked on forest floors where nature has taken them over			2
@entity3 , 57 , from @entity25 , first came across a @entity27 truck that had been dumped in a bush six years ago			1
after witnessing how the foliage had grown in and around the man - made machine , he was hooked and began to track down other unusual resting places			2
part of a sculpture park in @entity34 which contains 50 cars			2
covered in moss and lichen , they appear to blend in with the woods around them the sun sets over dozens of abandoned cars in 2014 in @entity43			0
@entity3 has travelled the world for six years searching for scenes like this two old cars poking out of a barn in @entity49 in 2014			1
@entity50 became hooked after finding a @entity27 truck that had been dumped in a bush seemingly camouflaged cars are stacked on top of each other causing them to blend in with the landscape , in 2013 in @entity58 another view of the @entity34 sculpture park			1
thick foliage has grown up through the rusting shells which were once roadworthy vehicles			0
a @entity13 abandoned at the park could fetch £ 82,000 if restored another exhibit at the @entity34 sculpture park ( left ) and a rusty red car abandoned in a forest in @entity4 , pictured by @entity3 in 2014 three cars that wo n't be going anywhere soon resting in a field in @entity71 while a working vehicle cruises by in the background this old car is barely discernible amidst at the bottom of a heap of rusty , overgrown junk in @entity58 , pictured by @entity3 in 2013 a battered ' stop ' sign stands ironically in front of a rusting vehicle that clearly has n't been driven for years in a yard in @entity58 @entity3 said : ' in @entity83 i came across a place with about 250 cars , untouched in a little wood			1
the cars have rusted over time and the paintwork has dulled ' the place was founded by the @entity16 after @entity17			0
they left these cars in a little wood , but they did not take them when they went back home			1
' ' other graveyards are not as rich in history but make for eerie and stunning places to explore			0
' while in many cases i can not retrace the history of the vessels , some sites are more discernible and conspicuous than others			0
' in @entity34 , for instance , i visited a car yard where vehicles had been disassembled during the 1950s			0
' because the site stood a mere two miles from @entity112 border , the car parts were then taken piece - by - piece over into the neighbouring country , where the importation of whole cars was forbidden			0
' the automobiles were reassembled - this was not prohibited			0
only 30 miles from my hometown , @entity25 , i discovered a special collection			1
' a car dealer had a funny idea			0
when he turned 50 in 2000 he arranged 50 cars from 1950 as a sculpture park in his garden and made a big party			0
' some friends got really angry when they saw , for instance , an extraordinary @entity13 left alone on purpose			1
' in restored condition this car could fetch $ 120,000 ( £ 82,000 )			1
' dozens of cars lining forest a pathway in @entity58 appear to be sinking into the mud			0
@entity3 is interested in how foliage can grown in and around man - made machines these @entity141 cars have seen better days as they lie abandoned in the baking sun out in the @entity49 desert , pictured in 2014 a yellow and black race car has clearly been battered by the elements before this picture was taken on february 27 last year in @entity4 @entity148 fashioned @entity141 cars and big yellow school buses site in quiet rows at a site in @entity153			1
@entity141 is a favourite subject for @entity3 a few blotches of paint cling on to the rusty shell of this old banger in @entity43			1
it 's hard to imagine it ever having been fit to drive a @entity162 collection of @entity163 , sold between 1939 to 1949 , look the worse for wear , pictured on february 15 this year in @entity4 a rusty yellow car abandoned by @entity167 forces after the @entity17 pictured in 2012 in @entity83			2
dead foliage litters the entire scene @entity170 covers and old fashioned vehicle in @entity4			2
@entity3 first discovered his passion for such subjects in his home country this car in @entity71 looks more capable of running than most but it is doubtful it would be wise to go for a spin nonetheless			2
