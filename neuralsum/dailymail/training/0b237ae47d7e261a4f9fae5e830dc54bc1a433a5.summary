appearing on @entity10 's @entity9 , 38 - year - old @entity1 wanted to speak out about her harassment at the hands of her ex to give a voice to other women - and men - trapped in abusive relationships			1
she said : ' i was pleased that he got convicted , but i was appalled at the sentence - community service for what he did			1
i want to send out the message that emotional abuse can be more damaging than physical abuse , external bruises fade but the bruises inside me they are still there , it ’s really hard			1
' @entity1 appeared on @entity9 this morning to discuss her abusive relationship with comedian @entity2 who was sentenced last week in her first television interview since @entity2 was convicted of harassment causing her fear of violence on at least two occasions @entity1 , from @entity38 , revealed that although she left @entity2 over his behaviour it was actually her father who went to the police and convinced her to press charges			1
she said : ' i did n’t actually go to the police			2
when i left him on july 4 , i just went home to my parents and slept in the spare room and for about two and half months i was just crying and looking at websites about domestic abuse because i was always one of these people who just thought , " i 'd never put up with that			2
the minute someone swore at me i 'd be gone "			2
' but it was my dad who went to the police			0
i was reluctant to , but i spoke to them and they were amazing and i just thought there is no way i can let him get away with this because who ’s he going to hurt next ? ' @entity1 appeared on the show to give a voice to the other men and women stuck in abusive relationships when asked why she put up with the abuse , she said : ' i absolutely adored him , he was the love of my life			2
in the beginning he was so lovely , but gently , ever so – i do n’t know how they do it , but the abuse is just sort of drip fed , and by the time that you ’re in love and completely smitten and i ’ve moved in with him and everything , then you think , " @entity84 , he ’s a control freak " because i ’ve got no friends now			1
' when we were first together it was absolutely amazing			0
he was just so wonderful , kind , generous , lovely , love of my life actually , and i just thought to myself , " how on earth did i ever get so lucky ? "			0
' @entity2 ' controlling behaviour included stopping her speaking to friends and family , dictating what she should wear , taunts about her weight and pushing her in front of a moving car			1
he even made her write down a list of anyone she had ever been intimate with on a pad of paper			0
@entity1 said : ' by doing the pad he had a complete record of my past , which is the ultimate control and he would use it against me			0
' incredibly @entity1 told hosts @entity111 and @entity113 that she does n’t know whether she still loves her ex. she said : ' i think so , yes			0
i think so , i do n’t know			0
i 'm so confused , my head is still kind of confused about it			0
