@entity15 said : ' @entity0 crashed on a fast and straight part of the descent			2
he was reaching for his pocket and the bike was swept away under him probably because of a bump or hole in the road			0
' @entity0 's withdrawal could see him refocus on the @entity170 , which begins in @entity171 on august 23			2
it could be @entity58 and sir @entity173 also ride the @entity170			0
@entity58 wrote on @entity174 : ' @entity176 loss for the @entity3 today			0
recover well @ albertocontador & i hope to see you at the @entity170			0
