by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 15:49 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 05:39 est , 14 november 2012 rail companies are drawing up controversial plans for officially sanctioned ' third class ' travel , a senior government figure has admitted			1
@entity7 admitted the @entity8 was considering the proposal , which was ditched in @entity10 by the former nationalised @entity11 in june 1956			1
it has sparked a new class - war row in the wake of chancellor @entity16 's recent spat after he sought a place in @entity18 after buying only a standard class ticket			2
the third way : a 1930s ' third class coach on an electric train in @entity24 can it get much worse ? many commuters are already left with standing room only on their journeys unions said the government was ' winding back the clock ' fifty years			1
@entity7 , who speaks on behalf of the government in the @entity33 , was responding to a question on whether invitations to bid for new rail franchises permitted the introduction of a third passenger class			1
a @entity40 peer , the @entity7 is the grandson of @entity43 post-war prime minister @entity42 , elected in 1945 , whose government nationalised the railways			1
the question and answer are recorded in @entity48 , the official record of the @entity50 under the heading : ' railways : @entity53 '			1
former labour minister @entity54 asked the government ' whether invitations to bid for new rail franchises permit the introduction of a third passenger class			1
' @entity7 replied that it did , noting : ' the current franchising system allows bidders to propose the introduction of a third passenger class as long as these proposals comply with the ticketing and settlement agreement and franchise agreement			1
' @entity66 - topped : it was only in 1844 that the law was passed to ensure third - class carriages were covered			0
this drawing appeared in a newspaper in 1847 squeeze : @entity72 has changed in more than 160 years when it comes to second - class travel luxury travel : first class was , as ever , the domain of the well - to - do third class travel first became an option in 1838			0
six years later an act of parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class			0
the @entity84 stipulated that all third - class passengers should be carried in covered accommodation			0
railway companies also began providing lighting in third - class carriages			0
however , whereas there were several oil lamps in the first class carriages , third - class carriages only had one			0
in 1844 the railways introduced @entity95 for government workers			1
the @entity98 car , introduced in @entity10 in 1874 , created a new level of comfort			0
@entity101 abolished second class travel in 1875 , upgrading third class passengers to second class standards			0
other railways followed the example			1
second class disappeared from fare tables until 1956 , when third class was renamed second			2
@entity11 later renamed this standard class			0
but the @entity111 insisted the answer had been deliberately ' misinterpreted ' by union critics , insisting the @entity7 had meant a third and additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a ' premium economy ' class on airlines			1
but critics said that if there were three classes – the bottom class would by definition be ' third class			0
' @entity125 , left wing leader of the @entity127 transport union said : ' now we know , the door is open for the train operators to introduce third passenger class as and when it suits them			0
' we knew that this government was winding the clock back on employment , benefits and legal rights but now they are opening up the option to dive back in time more than 50 years to the days of third class rail travel			1
' but @entity54 said : ' i was astonished by the response which suggested there could be a cattle class carriage at the back or one for toffs at the front '			2
but a @entity111 spokesman said : ' it is completely untrue and deliberately misleading to claim that this government wants to introduce ' third class ' fares			2
' it absolutely does not			0
the minimum level of service is standard class and the government is only interested in proposals from train operators that would improve , at the very least maintain , existing standards			2
' the spokesman added : ' the government 's spokesman in the @entity33 , @entity42 , spoke of the possibility of ' a third passenger class ' like premium economy on flights or business leisure class on @entity170 , not reducing current standards			1
' the @entity127 is deliberately confusing the two to scare train passengers			0
' it is understood that @entity174 was considering the introduction of a third class – between standard and first – in its scuppered bid for the @entity178			0
back to the future : a third class dining car on the @entity101 in 1898			2

the first time plans have been considered since they were ditched in 1956
lord @entity7 is the grandson of @entity42 who nationalised the railways
unions accuse government of ' winding back the clock '
