it was an extraordinary thing to say , akin to putting your head in the noose and stepping up on the stool beneath the gallows			0
@entity6 , who started his second spell as @entity9 manager just 70 days ago on september 4 , could be out of a job come sunday night as a consequence of his own words			1
he has , in effect , filled out his own @entity15 form and is awaiting the rubber - stamp from his employer			0
@entity6 said of the upcoming @entity19 qualifier with @entity20 in @entity21 : ' if we lose , it makes sense that i leave			1
' @entity6 , pictured here during wednesday 's defeat to @entity28 , has said he will resign if @entity9 lose to @entity20 in their @entity19 qualifier on sunday night striker @entity31 rues another missed chance in @entity9 's 3 - 2 loss to @entity28 in @entity21 ( left to right ) @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 leave the pitch after the defeat ( @entity40 to right ) @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity35 react after a fourth loss in five games and after wednesday night 's 3 - 2 friendly loss to @entity28 heaped even more pressure on his shoulders , @entity6 , sounding as gloomy as a man writing his own obituary , confirmed : ' yes , i will still leave if we lose to @entity20			1
' even by the standards of their recent slump - a @entity57 hangover that has seen four defeats in five matches - @entity9 should beat a team ranked 99th in the world			1
following @entity62 's tinkering , expanding the tournament from 16 to 24 games and ushering through up to three teams from each qualifying group , @entity9 will not fail to reach the finals			1
but after wednesday night , @entity6 is not as certain as he was when he made that ultimatum on himself last weekend			1
the odds were stacked against the former @entity71 caretaker boss from the outset			2
@entity9 were excellent at the @entity73 , finishing third , and @entity74 returned from @entity75 and headed off to @entity76 a national hero			2
the way he had his team playing vibrant , attacking football was a tough act to follow and so it has proved			0
there had been criticism of his return in some quarters , with plenty saying @entity88 should have come in			0
@entity74 is greeted by the tv cameras and fans after @entity9 returned home from the @entity73 @entity92 congratulates @entity93 after @entity9 's 5 - 1 rout of @entity95 at the @entity73 @entity9 's coaching team of ( from left ) @entity98 , @entity6 and @entity99 have struggled september 4 ( @entity100 ) @entity101 2 @entity9 0 september 9 ( @entity19 qualifier ) @entity103 2 @entity104 october 10 ( @entity19 qualifier ) @entity9 3 @entity106 1 october 13 ( @entity19 qualifier ) @entity107 2 @entity9 0 november 12 ( @entity100 ) @entity9 2 @entity28 3 and the results have been underwhelming to say the least			1
in @entity6 's first game , a friendly with @entity101 in @entity112 at the start of september , they found themselves two - down inside the first 10 minutes			1
in their opening @entity117 qualifier , against the @entity103 , they were beaten by a stoppage time goal by @entity120			0
in last month 's double - header , they had to come from behind to beat lowly @entity106 and then slumped to a 2 - 0 defeat in @entity107 , leaving them third in the standings			1
and their glaring weaknesses were exposed in an exciting game with @entity28 at the @entity129			2
after @entity41 had rewarded a high - tempo start to the second - half by bringing @entity9 level at 1 - 1 , they were unlocked at the back by a sweeping @entity136 ball , which left @entity137 to score his second of the night			1
and @entity28 's third was the worst			2
@entity140 was woefully out of step with the rest of the back line , playing @entity145 onside as he received @entity146 's through ball , rounded @entity148 and finished			0
@entity145 ( right ) sprints off in celebration after rounding goalkeeper @entity148 to score @entity28 's third @entity150 was highly critical of the @entity152 defence after the match , saying there is no ' security or stability ' @entity31 and @entity9 made front page news in @entity158 on thursday morning on both occasions , @entity6 sat in shock on the bench , apparently unaware of how to fix things			1
@entity150 , at least , did n't hold back in his criticism of the back line afterwards			0
' we should not point the finger at each other , ' he told @entity168			0
' but we have to speak to each other about the errors that were made			0
we have no security or stability at the back and we fall into repetition			0
' @entity6 was n't helped when centre - back @entity175 was forced off injured in the first - half , replaced by @entity34 , and the manager admitted they were threadbare at the back			1
' it is true we are a bit thin on good defenders , especially after the new injury to @entity175 , ' @entity6 said			2
' i do not have many alternatives			0
' under @entity92 , any defensive frailties were usually masked by exciting forward play but now they look profligate			0
@entity34 fails to stop @entity28 's @entity189 getting in a header on goal during the friendly @entity41 blasts home @entity9 's equaliser early in the second - half but they were soon behind again @entity35 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity140 ( left ) and @entity41 after his goal both goals , from @entity41 and @entity35 were spectacular , but @entity31 was wasteful			1
at one point he missed an open goal from two yards out			0
@entity93 , not quite fully fit and left out of the @entity28 game with sunday in mind , can not return soon enough but he has been far from his best for @entity76 this season			2
@entity208 , in excellent form for @entity207 , failed to sparkle for @entity9 and was removed for @entity209 on the hour			2
the crowd only became animated when @entity150 received the ball and many had already voted with their feet , with sections of the ground empty			0
this @entity9 fan was still getting behind his team - but many jeered as they slipped to defeat there were audible jeers when the teams walked off at half - time and after the @entity28 goals			1
the @entity9 optimism of the @entity73 has long since evaporated			0
but @entity6 has been here before			0
when first appointed @entity9 manager in 1995 , he started with four losses from five , including competitive defeats to the @entity103 and @entity228			1
they still made the finals , albeit via the play - offs			0
in that first spell , @entity6 remained until 1998 , leading @entity9 to the semi-finals of the @entity73 in @entity234			1
this time round it may be a considerably shorter stay and under - fire @entity6 has already outlined his own exit strategy .			2

@entity6 is on the brink following a fourth defeat in five games
the @entity9 manager said he would resign if they lose to @entity20
sunday 's @entity19 qualifier in @entity21 has taken on vital *importance*
@entity9 lost 3 - 2 to @entity28 in a friendly on wednesday night
@entity6 , the former @entity71 manager , has only been in job 70 days
