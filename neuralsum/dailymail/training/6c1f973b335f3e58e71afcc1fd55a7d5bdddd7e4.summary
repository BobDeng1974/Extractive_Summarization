@entity1 snipers are receiving security training from the @entity3 amid fears that they and their families will be targeted by @entity7 terrorists following a series of blunders			1
defence chiefs published online and in official reports the names and photographs of sharpshooters – a move the snipers say could endanger their lives			1
at least 50 troops , including those belonging to elite @entity21 and @entity22 units , and some who have since left the @entity1 , have attended briefings as concerns increase for their safety			1
the identity of snipers must be protected because jihadis consider them to be high - value targets on the courses at @entity3 headquarters in @entity33 , the snipers are being advised how to escape and evade capture if jihadis strike at their homes or when they are going about their everyday lives			1
they are also warned not to carry military identification , remove their names from the electoral roll and to report suspicious activity to police			1
the courses include briefings on cyber-security , with the snipers being shown how to thwart attempts to hack into their mobile phones , email and @entity50 pages			1
the extraordinary measures had to be brought in after the @entity52 breached rules that state that members of @entity56 's @entity55 and snipers should never be identified			1
the rules must be strictly observed because jihadis consider snipers to be high - value targets			1
their specialist role and devastating impact on the battlefield have been popularised in the @entity66 - nominated film @entity67 , starring @entity68 as @entity70 @entity69 , who was credited with 160 confirmed kills in @entity72			1
last night , a former @entity74 sniper described the horrifying moment when he found an @entity1 report on the internet which described how he had shot dead a @entity79 fighter in @entity81 province , southern @entity82 , at a range of more than 1,000 yards			1
he said : ' since then i 've lived every day with the fear that i or my family members will be targeted			2
i can never feel entirely safe in this country after coming back from the war zone and being identified in that report			1
' it is especially sickening as while i was still serving in @entity82 , i gave my commanders explicit instructions that i did n't want to be identified or put up for any sort of recognition when we came home			1
' it was a stupid mistake on their part			2
i only found out when a friend pointed it out			2
naturally people are concerned for me , and as snipers we 're aware of the threats to us			1
' the sniper has taken drastic measures to protect himself and his relatives , including varying his routes to and from local shops and keeping a ' crash - out bag ' – a rucksack containing items he would need to evade capture by @entity7 extremists			1
the man , whose experiences on the front line left him suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , genuinely fears he is a target			2
he added : ' i 'm careful who i discuss my @entity1 life with , while giving out my phone number or my home address is a complete no - no. and when i 'm going somewhere for the first time , i need to work out how i could get out of there fast and without being tailed			1
' i 'm prepared for ' going to ground ' , as we snipers call it			1
i 'd grab the crash - out bag and go			2
it might sound like paranoia to most people but then they 're not snipers			2
they do n't know how badly the terrorists want us dead			2
' he is not the first sniper to be exposed by blundering @entity52 officials			1
four years ago , @entity144 trooper @entity143 's cover was blown after he achieved the longest successful shots by a @entity56 soldier – killing two @entity79 fighters from two miles away			2
on his return to @entity56 , trooper @entity143 agreed to be interviewed by the media after receiving assurances from @entity52 officials that none of his personal details would be revealed			1
but the officials failed to inform newspapers , leading to the publication of his name and family information			0
days later he was told by police that @entity56 - based @entity163 sympathisers were plotting to kidnap him			2
trooper @entity143 suffered acute distress and later received £ 100,000 compensation from the @entity52 the revelation that snipers are receiving enhanced security and cyber-security training follows the brutal execution of fusilier @entity174 in @entity175 in 2013 , and recent intelligence from a government agency , the @entity167 , that jihadis want to kidnap a soldier or police officer			1
an @entity52 spokesman said last night : ' keeping our personnel and assets safe is of the utmost importance , which is why our security arrangements are kept under continual review and frequently tested			1
' all personnel are given clear guidance on social media use and informed of the standards of behaviour expected of them whether offline or online , on duty or off duty			0
' by a @entity74 sniper i was a @entity74 sniper who served multiple tours of southern @entity82			0
being a civilian now is a big change and to be honest i miss being a sharpshooter every day – going to the war zone and doing my job			0
but then i look at my daughter and i realise i want to be at home with her			0
i also did my fair share [ of killing ] , but with what is going on in the world today maybe what i did was not enough ? when i was down there in @entity82 , i had no idea that i 'd face these threats at home			0
as an ex-sniper , i can never go public about what i did as a sharpshooter			0
instead , i live a quiet life in order to protect my family – they are my priority and it is them i worry about			0
i 'm always wary of people asking questions about my background and i do n't give out my personal details			0
i also change my phone numbers and emails			0
snipers should take these precautions , especially considering what has happened to those who 've had their cover blown in the media and on the internet			2
they 've been to hell and back since officials let slip their names , which was unforgivable			2
so it is good that snipers are getting extra training to protect themselves			1
it is very hard for people to understand what we have to deal with , because they have n't done what we 've done			0
@entity246 is a dark art. basically we 're there to kill the enemy and we 're good at it			0
but that makes us unpopular with the enemy and their sympathisers here , so we 're high - value targets			1
i 'm not looking for understanding or sympathy			0
it is easy for me to come to terms with my actions , basically because it has to be			0
i was woken up one night in @entity82 and told to take out a @entity79 fighter			0
i did it and i was back in my bed asleep ten minutes later as if nothing had happened			0
sometimes it is that easy mentally			0
i could n't be constantly thinking or worrying about what i was doing because i would have big problems , would n't i ? the film @entity67 is huge and it has got people thinking about how we deal with the job			0
whether what a sniper does gets too personal or emotional for him to deal with depends on his mindset , his experience and his upbringing			0
for me , blocking thoughts like that got easier as i went back to @entity82 and did the same thing again and again			0
i am sceptical when i hear figures for so - called confirmed kills for @entity56 snipers , such as the 173 reported last week for a @entity22			1
how can they be sure ? people do n't normally die straight away when you shoot them			0
it is also hard to tell from long range			0
the idea of sniping is that you fire from far enough away that you do n't have to go down there and check			0
killing more people does n't make you a better soldier either .			0
