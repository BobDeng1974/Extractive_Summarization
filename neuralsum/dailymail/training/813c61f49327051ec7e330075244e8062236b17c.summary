the @entity1 village widely viewed as @entity3 's @entity2 , where the first proven patient , a two - year - old boy , fell ill and died in december last year , has been cracked to the core			1
@entity6 , a small village at the top of a forested hill reached by a rutted red earth track , is known throughout the world as the birthplace of the most recent @entity3 outbreak			1
today villagers here are in debt , stigmatized , hungry and still angry and deeply suspicious about who or what brought the disease that has devastated their lives			0
a young girl plays with hair in the @entity1 village of @entity26 , some 400 miles south - east of @entity22 , @entity1 , believed to be @entity3 's ground zero children listen to the village chief in the communal room in @entity26 , where villagers are in debt , stigmatized , hungry and still angry and deeply suspicious about who or what brought the disease that has devastated their lives @entity6 , a small village at the top of a forested hill reached by a rutted red earth track , is notorious as the birthplace and crucible of the most deadly incarnation of the ebola virus to date in @entity6 , as in many other villages in areas in @entity44 affected by @entity3 , the disease is shrouded in mystery , surrounded by suspicion and rumors			1
people here still believe that @entity3 was disseminated by white people seeking the deaths of blacks , including through a measles vaccination campaign ; by a laboratory testing bats to create a vaccination against the virus ; by politicians from a rival tribe bent it is a question scientists have yet to answer conclusively , although they have come to @entity6 to test great apes and bats as possible sources			1
when 2 - year - old @entity63 caught a fever , started vomiting , passed blood in his stool and died two days later , nobody knew why			1
now @entity63 is widely recognized by researchers as @entity69 , the first person to have died in the latest @entity3 outbreak back on december 28 last year			1
@entity73 's son , @entity63 is widely recognized by researchers as @entity69 , the first person to have died of @entity3 back on december 28 last year children carry sanitization kits supplied by @entity76 in the @entity1 village of @entity6 a group of young girls return to the village of @entity6 , home of @entity3 's @entity69 women gather in @entity6 to prepare grains as life goes on beyond @entity3 in the little village in the meantime , @entity3 has left @entity63 's grandfather , 85 - year - old @entity87 , without hope			1
@entity87 has locked the room in his house where the child died			2
' eight people died in that room			2
it must remain closed , ' he said			0
' all that is left for me is to wonder why @entity97 gives me any more days on this @entity98			2
' @entity6 is a village of about 400 people — down from 600 last year , after dozens of young men abandoned it in the belief that the @entity63 family or the entire village was cursed , according to the village chief			1
the village doctor , @entity106 , was among the first to flee , and the clinic is shuttered and shunned as a place of death , not healing			2
those left here are gaunt , skin stretched tightly over their bones , with the only false signs of fat being the cruelly bloated stomachs of malnourished children			2
families crowd into two - roomed houses built from home - made mud bricks			2
their ' kitchens ' are open fires outside marked by three blackened stones			0
@entity73 , @entity63 's father , hugs his arms to his chest , as if for comfort , when he talks about the many deaths in his family , especially that of his only son			1
' i was so traumatized by the deaths , ' said @entity63			1
' i think we still are			0
' like most of the villagers , he 's also broke			2
when @entity63 took his son to the village doctor , he had to pay 20,000 guinea francs ( $ 2.75 ) for medication			1
more expensive and useless trips to the clinic followed as @entity63 's 4 - year - old daughter died , then her mother , eight months ' pregnant , followed quickly by the grandmother , an aunt and the midwife who delivered his wife of a stillborn baby			1
@entity63 had no money to pay for the burials and feed the many mourners who came from other villages to perform a mass funeral rite			1
so he borrowed 1 ½ bags of rice and 250,000 francs ( about $ 35 ) — more cash than he sees in a year — and killed his last goat			0
he says it will take him a year to pay back his debt			0
a child grabs food from a woman in a poor village that has become even poorer in the wake of @entity3 village treasurer @entity170 said everyone contributed to the village coffers , but that borrowing to pay for all the burials in @entity26 has emptied the communal chest @entity176 , the village 's health assistant , is the only health worker left from the epidemic that killed the village 's three midwives , known here as ' wise women ' even the little he had was lost , when everything was burned to avoid contamination			1
as he complains of the chilly nights , he puts his arm around one of his surviving children , 6 - year - old @entity189 , who snuffled from a cold as snot ran down her nose			0
' i do n't own a blanket to cover myself at night , ' he said bitterly			0
' i do n't own a goat ... what i carry is a weight of sorrow			0
' before the @entity3 outbreak , village treasurer @entity170 said , everyone contributed to the village coffers to give them a cushion in case of an emergency			1
but borrowing to pay for all the burials in @entity26 has emptied the communal chest that once held 8 million francs ( $ 1,100 )			1
' this was a catastrophe , ' he said			0
' now we have nothing			0
' worse than nothing — some of those indebted to the village fund have themselves died of @entity3			1
in a tragic irony , the burials that bankrupted the village only helped to spread the disease			2
when people died , their bodies were washed by relatives , in line with tradition			0
they found out too late that this is one way to pass on @entity3 , which can be caught only by direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person			1
@entity6 — whose name in the local @entity233 language means ' this is as far as we go ' — has also been left isolated , as neighbors in other villages turned on it			0
' people are very , very angry with us , saying the disease started with us , ' said village chief @entity241			2
@entity242 sits in his home in the @entity1 village of @entity26 , some 400 miles south - east of @entity22 , @entity1			1
@entity245 lost his wife , daughter and two grandchildren to the deadly disease			0
he is @entity73 's father in law @entity251 sits in @entity26 , where as in many other villages across @entity3 country , the disease is shrouded in mystery , surrounded by suspicion and rumors villagers wait for a distribution of sanitization supplies from @entity76 in the school @entity6 people here still believe that @entity3 was disseminated by white people seeking the deaths of blacks , including through a measles vaccination campaign ; by a laboratory testing bats to create a vaccination against the virus ; by politicians from a rival tribe bent on killing off the forest people ; by white miners looking to exploit a nearby mountain of iron ore mourners who came to @entity6 refused to eat any of the food or drink the water			1
eventually they stopped attending village funerals altogether , a slight that cuts deep in @entity282 culture			0
at one point , they isolated @entity6 for days , @entity176 said			0
they smashed the bridge that leads to town , cutting off access to the only working well and the main road			0
people in @entity6 have even lost one of their few sources of protein to @entity3			2
after the virus was officially recognized in @entity1 at the end of march , villagers were warned to stop eating ' bush meat ' — the fruit bats , cane rats and monkeys that provide protein but that scientists suspect are a reservoir for viruses like @entity3			1
without protein , the villagers are less healthy , said the village 's health assistant @entity176 , in a country where @entity76 estimates 50 percent of child deaths are related to malnutrition			0
@entity176 is the only health worker left from the epidemic that killed the village 's three midwives , known here as ' wise women			2
' ' they were the ones called to care for people when they became ill , ' said @entity318 , who speaks for the women of @entity6			0
' who will care for us now ? ' on killing off the forest people ; by white miners looking to exploit a nearby mountain of iron ore			0
@entity6 does have one hard - won victory to be proud of — @entity3 is gone , at least for now , and the village is still standing			1
@entity176 is thankful , and credits some of the doctors who came			0
' ( otherwise ) this whole village would be dead , ' he said			0
' it would have disappeared from the maps			0
