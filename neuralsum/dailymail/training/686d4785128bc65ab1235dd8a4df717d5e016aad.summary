by @entity0 @entity1 trained on the outfield with @entity3 before day two of their @entity4 = @entity7 match against @entity8 after his return to cricket over the weekend			1
the 36 - year - old former @entity12 captain seemed to be feeling the effects of his exertions at @entity15 , tweeting on monday : ' still a bit stiff from saturdays 12 overs just bowled 5 more now for a rub ! ' however , @entity1 showed flashes of his old genius during his comeback for @entity22 , taking a superb caught - and - bowled among his three wickets			1
throwing his hat into the ring : @entity1 trains with the @entity3 team at @entity27 catch him if you can : @entity1 's return is expected to raise attendances at @entity27 video : watch @entity1 's stunning caught - and - bowled and if he pulls one of those beauties out during the @entity35 , it will justify @entity3 's pay incentive			1
@entity1 is set to cash in on his return to top - level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for @entity3 ’s @entity42 home matches			1
it is understood the all - rounder , who is hopeful of ending his five - year absence from the game on friday as @entity3 host roses rivals @entity48 at @entity27 , will receive £ 1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure — possibly 8,000			1
the county ’s two home matches so far in the @entity35 have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against @entity54 and 5,900 against @entity55			2
laughing all the way to the bank : @entity1 will receive a payment per fan for @entity3 's home games last year ’s home fixture against @entity48 drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any of their four other @entity42 games in @entity66			1
since @entity68 , fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in @entity12 ’s defeat by @entity71 at @entity72 on saturday , may also be available for selection for @entity3 , the opportunity will be there for @entity1 to add a few thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses			1
@entity1 is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals @entity48 , but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘ cricket reasons ’			1
@entity1 , 36 , came through a low - key playing comeback on saturday by helping @entity15 beat @entity82 in a lowly @entity84 game			1
comeback : @entity1 returned to cricket when he played for @entity15 on saturday low key : the former @entity12 all - rounder took three wickets on his return to the game he knows if he gets selected for @entity3 on the big stage now , somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons			1
‘ i ’d be lying to you if i said i did n’t think about playing against @entity48 , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it will be a full house , however , friday is a long way away , it really is — if i get a go , i get a go but i ’m not by any means expecting to play			1
‘ on thursday i ’ve got a game with the @entity104 second team , which i ’m just going to go out there and enjoy			2
i ’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself thinking that this is a trial for friday or anything like that			1
i ’m just going to play — and if i get picked , i get picked			2
‘ if i ’m going to play then someone else is going to miss out			2
they ’ve got to be comfortable that , when they tell the player who is missing out , it ’s the right decision for cricket reasons			2
and i need to be comfortable with that as well			2
‘ so it ’s all down to cricket , down to what value i can give the side and whether i can give more than the person i take over from			2
’ after saturday ’s cameo , which include facing three balls as a batsman before being caught on the boundary attempting a six , he stressed how the competition for @entity3 is especially tough now			2
realistic : @entity1 said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback @entity128 : @entity1 has set his sights on playing against rivals @entity48 on friday night ‘ i ’m not putting too much pressure on myself , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ i ’m not making big hopes			2
‘ i ’m just going to see where it goes			0
i appreciate that @entity3 are on a roll in @entity135 and there ’s @entity68 and @entity137 and people to come back into that side			0
‘ so it ’s not a gim me that i ’m going to play			0
but i ’m going to try to put myself in the frame			0
the comeback has just crept up on me			0
it ’s not something that was a goal of mine , that i set out to do			0
‘ it has just come around quite innocently and that ’s been the nice thing about it			0
i ’m not chasing anything			0
i ’m just enjoying it			0
why should n’t i ? i like cricket			0
’ with @entity1 offered a portion of the @entity27 gate for his return to top - level cricket , @entity154 takes a look at other stipulations which sports stars have requested ... @entity162 @entity162 shocked football by moving from @entity164 to @entity165 in 1982 , dropping down a division			1
club sponsors @entity168 had to help pay his £ 5,000 - a - week wages			1
@entity170 the @entity172 manager agreed to become the coach of @entity174 in 2002 , but only with the proviso that if war broke out in the country he could leave			0
@entity178 when the striker joined @entity180 in 1996 he demanded the @entity172 football club build him a house for every year of his contract			0
he was there for three years			0
@entity185 the @entity187 footballer insisted @entity188 put in his contract that they would arrange cooking lessons for his wife , when he signed for them in 1999			0
