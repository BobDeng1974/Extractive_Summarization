researchers testing a major upgrade to a telescope have spotted a bizarre supernova remnant that looks uncannily like a manatee			2
@entity5 is one of the largest supernova remnants ever viewed by the @entity8 , measuring nearly 700 light years across , and covering two degrees on the sky â€“ the span of four full moons			1
the unique 20,000 year old phenomenon was spotted following a major upgrade to the @entity15 's ( @entity15 ) @entity8 ( @entity8 )			0
they occupy the remainder of their day resting , often on their backs with their flippers crossed over their large bellies , in a pose closely resembling @entity5			1
dangerous encounters with boat propellers injure many of these curious herbivores , giving them deep , curved scars similar in appearance to the arcs made by the powerful jets on the large @entity5 remnant			1
' optically bright astronomical objects , those visible to the eye and optical telescopes , often are nicknamed for their earthly likenesses , such as the @entity46 and @entity47 , ' said the @entity48 in a statement			0
when the @entity8 's giant @entity5 image reached the @entity52 's office , @entity53 , the director 's executive assistant , saw the likeness to a manatee , the endangered marine mammals known as ' sea cows ' that congregate in warm waters in the southeastern @entity60			1
the enormous @entity5 cloud formed when a giant star , 18,000 light years away in the constellation of @entity64 , exploded as a supernova around twenty thousand years ago , sending its outer gases flying outward in an expanding bubble			1
the remaining , gravitationally - crushed relic of that giant star , usually a black hole , feeds on gas from a very close , companion star			0
the cannibalized gas collects in a disk around the black hole			0
the disk and black hole 's network of powerful magnetic field lines acts like an enormous railroad system to snag charged particles out of the disk and channel them outward in powerful jets traveling at nearly the speed of light			0
the @entity84 , @entity5 , ( green dot ) is found 18,000 light years away in the direction of the constellation @entity64 , the @entity64 this system of a black hole and its feeder star shines brightly in both radio waves and x-rays and is known collectively as the @entity93			1
over time , the microquasar 's jets have forced their way through the expanding gases of the @entity5 bubble , eventually punching bulges outward on either side			2
the jets also wobble , like an unstable spinning top , and blaze vivid corkscrew patterns across the inflating bulges			0
until now , the nebula was known as @entity5 , a less catchy name by being the 50th radio source listed in the @entity108 , assembled in 1958 by @entity110 astronomer , @entity111 .			2

@entity5 is one of the largest supernova remnants ever viewed
@entity19 , known as sea cows , average around 10 feet long , weigh over 1000 pounds , and spend up to eight hours a day grazing on sea plants
