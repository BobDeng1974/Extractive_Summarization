organisers of an electronic music festival in country @entity0 last weekend were disgusted to find mountains of trash left behind by party - goers			1
the @entity7 festival , a weekend of ' psytrance ' , techno and art , attracted thousands of revellers to the picturesque @entity13 camping ground , 245 km north - west of @entity14			1
but festival - goers left much more than their dancing shoes behind			1
" we 're all here cleaning this up because a percentage of you have made a hell of a mess and left it all behind - and you really obviously do n't give a toss , ' says @entity25 , a member of the @entity27 football club and one of the clean - up volunteers in a video of the aftermath			1
' @entity32 's fair - you would n't do this at your mum and dad 's place , do n't do it at our lake			1
' if they 're organised enough to bring couches , surely they can be organised enough to take them home , it 's just simple courtesy , ' says @entity25 as he loads a truck with garbage bags and old cushions			2
' @entity32 's fair - you would n't do this at your mum and dad 's place , do n't do it at our lake , ' says @entity25 , one of the volunteers with the @entity77 the @entity79 event prides itself on being environmentally conscious and before the party , urged festival goers , as ' friends of the eartth , ' to leave no trace			1
' if we can become responsible caretakers of the land , as is our heritage , we can continue to gather here for many moons to come …			0
if we ca n't ... sadly with the indictment on our shoulders we will have to leave … , ' stated the festival website			2
the @entity7 festival was held here on the @entity95 , near @entity27 in country @entity0 the picturesque camp site before the @entity79 music festival last weekend the beautiful @entity98 is a popular camping spot for nature lovers and recreational fishers according to the @entity103 , it took four solid days and a team of fifty plus volunteers to get the site back to how it was			1
a bush doof is an outdoor dance party , usually held in a remote area , or in bush or rainforests outside big cities in @entity114 or @entity115			0
' @entity116 ' is an @entity114 term for loud , heavy bass electronic music			0
in most cases , bush doofs are small and secret , promoted by word - of - mouth or social media			0
sometimes they last for days			0
last year , a central coast teenager survived an 80 - metre cliff fall after trying to avoid the cover charge for a ' bush doof ' in the @entity128 , north of @entity129			0
another 21 - year - old man went missing for more than 48 hours in forest south - east of @entity132 after attending a remote rave			0
@entity135 doofs usually involve live techno or trance djs and are notorious for illicit drug use			0
' people were disappointed by the rubbish , but i was out there yesterday and i 'd say 90 per cent of the camp ground was restored to it 's natural state , ' @entity103 secretary , @entity145 , told @entity146			1
some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options in comments to social media			2
' unlike @entity154 and others where you are provided with a garbage bag at the gate they did not even mention to us anything about rubbish disposal , ' wrote one @entity51 user who attended the festival			2
' we were never told that there were any bins on site and did not even see one until we drove out the gate on the last day			0
perhaps if they want people to be more responsible they need to take responsibility for informing festival patrons about how to properly dispose of their rubbish and provide adequate bins ! ' but @entity79 organisers have scolded festival goers on their official @entity178 page , posting ' @entity79 festival patrons got a lot to learn ! take some @entity181 ! ' take some @entity181 : ' @entity175 say @entity79 patrons have a lot to learn ' you obviously do n't give a toss ' : volunteers were frustrated at cleaning up the mess taking out the trash : it took volunteers more than four days to clean up the campsite @entity192 says the @entity27 club provided bins and a rubbish crew for the event and its members were out in force for the clean - up afterwards			1
' you 've got to remember this is a huge area and a lot of people , so it was a big job , but not a mammoth one considering , ' @entity145 said			0
' overall it was a positive event and the town and local businesses have been extremely supportive			0
' @entity192 does n't believe the trash will spell the end of the @entity79 festival but says to future revellers : ' enjoy yourselves , respect the environment			2
' leave no trace : ' there is nothing i hate more than walking around and seeing thousands of those empty @entity218 bulbs scattered around what was originally a beautiful clean space ' , says one @entity222 user who found a better use for the rubbish			2
some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options @entity0 's @entity234 in full swing last weekend : ' disgusting its left up to the local community that was kind enough to let us on their beautiful land , ' wrote one festival - goer on social media .			1

festival - goers leave mountains of rubbish behind after last weekend 's @entity234 in country @entity0
it took four days and more than 50 volunteers to clean up the @entity95 camp ground
' @entity32 's fair . you would n't do this at your mum and dad 's place , do n't do it at our lake , says volunteer
