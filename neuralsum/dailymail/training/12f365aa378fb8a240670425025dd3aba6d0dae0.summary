it ’s probably the last thing you feel like doing first thing in the morning - but smiling after being rudely awakened is compulsory with this latest app. dubbed ‘ @entity5 ’ , the app requires users to grin into their smartphone camera before its incessant buzzing is turned off			1
the camera tracks key features on a user ’s face and then determines whether that person is happy enough to be allowed out of bed			1
developed by @entity27 - based developers @entity28 , the free app will save a picture of the user smiling in a photo gallery as a reminder			1
it is currently only available for @entity35 devices , and includes a snooze feature for the days that users do n’t feel like smiling			1
for bearded snoozers , the app may not work as well			2
‘ thick facial hair interrupts the smile detection process , ’ the company wrote on @entity41			2
the alarm clock app wakes a person up with the sound of sizzling bacon , while a connected scent device emits a bacon perfume for many people , a hearty fried breakfast including a couple of rashers of bacon is a desirable way to start the day			1
but as cooked breakfast or a bacon sandwich is n’t the healthiest option , a new @entity60 app and device that wafts the appealing smell of the cured meat could prove to be a more sensible option			2
