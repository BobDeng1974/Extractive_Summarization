@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned that @entity2 may not feature in any of the team 's remaining six games this season because he fears playing the troubled midfielder could see him break his police curfew and end up in prison			1
after his third conviction last week for assaulting a police officer , @entity2 escaped a jail sentence but was placed under a restriction of liberty order and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am for 16 weeks			1
that has already ruled him out of the evening matches with @entity17 at @entity18 on wednesday and at @entity19 on friday may 1 , but @entity0 fears that even playing in the three remaining games in the @entity21 , which kick off at 3pm , could leave the player at risk of breaching his order			1
@entity1 rogue @entity2 has been handed his third conviction after assaulting a police officer @entity1 manager @entity0 says he will not risk playing the troubled midfielder again this season @entity0 is worried that if @entity2 was , for example , called up for after - match drug testing , required hospital treatment for an injury or was caught in traffic on the 80 - mile journey back to his home in @entity35 , he would run perilously close to his 7pm curfew			1
and he admits the only game in which @entity2 would be able to safely feature is the final - day derby at @entity39 which kicks off at 12.30pm on may 24 , but even then he may not be risked			1
' @entity2 is available for selection but there is no guarantee he will play , ' conceded @entity0 yesterday			1
' he has a curfew and we do n't want him to break it			0
' this is something i will need to look at between now and the end of the season			2
and we need to look at all aspects of this - where he is playing , what time he will leave after the match , travelling times and whether he gets an injury			2
' there are all sorts of things that could happen			0
heavy traffic , or his car could break down , or he could be called in for drug testing - which can often take a long time			0
' @entity2 stays in the central belt so there are times when the journey could take longer than an hour and a half			1
and the last thing we want to see is @entity2 getting into trouble because he misses his time zone			1
' the last game of the season is definitely one he can play in because of the early kick off			0
we 've not asked ( the courts ) for any special dispensation			0
but it 's something we might look at			0
' @entity2 has been fitted with an electronic tag on his ankle and , if selected by @entity0 , it 's understood the match - day referee would need to inspect the device before each game to ensure there are no health and safety risks			1
law 4 in the @entity86 states : ' a player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player ( including any kind of jewellery )			0
' @entity0 said : ' there 's been a suggestion that he ca n't play with the current tag he has got but i am sure he could			2
i 've seen it happen before in @entity100 football and it 's something we 've been looking into			0
we are just waiting for confirmation			0
' meanwhile , @entity1 have agreed a pre-contract to sign @entity106 midfielder @entity105 on a three - year deal			1
the 23 - year - old had been a peripheral figure at @entity110			0
@entity106 boss @entity111 told the @entity106 official website : ' the option to sign an extended contract with a fellow @entity116 club was one which @entity105 felt he could n't turn down			2
' @entity2 goes in with a high challenge on @entity120 's @entity119 ( right ) at @entity121			2

@entity2 is currently on house arrest for assaulting a police officer
the @entity1 midfielder has been ruled out of evening matches for his club
