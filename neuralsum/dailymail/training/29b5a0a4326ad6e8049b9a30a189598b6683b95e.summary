mrs @entity6 is arguing that she has the right to decide who lives in her home and is seeking damages for alleged harassment by her estranged son			1
yesterday , the court heard that the property had been the family home for nearly four decades before the row			0
mrs @entity6 had been renting the property but in 2001 she bought it jointly with her son for just £ 200,000			1
mrs @entity6 paid only £ 5,000 , with her son , an electrician currently living in @entity47 , @entity48 , contributing £ 150,000 in cash and acting as guarantor for a £ 45,000 mortgage in his mother ’s name , the court heard			1
a deed of trust was drawn up between them at the time of the purchase , stating that they each owned half of the house			0
bargain : the terraced home in @entity65 , south west @entity30 , cost just £ 200,000 in 2001 @entity66 , for mr @entity11 , said his client ’s mother was being ‘ unreasonable ’			1
‘ the trigger for the litigation was mrs @entity6 ’s decision to change the locks to the property when her son said he wanted to spend more time there , ’ he said			2
‘ the purpose of the trust was to provide a home for mr @entity11 , as well as mrs @entity6 , and he indeed occupied the property between 2001 and his exclusion in 2012			1
’ criticising mrs @entity6 ’s ‘ unreasonable refusal to allow him to resume occupation ’ , mr @entity66 told the judge that , in the event that it is impossible for mr @entity11 to return to the house , his client wants it sold and the proceeds split			2
‘ if it is impossible for him to live at the property , the purpose for which the trust was created has come to an end and the court can make an order for sale , ’ he said			0
‘ this is a situation where there is over £ 1million of equity in the property , and each occupier would be entitled to at least £ 500,000 on sale			0
‘ that should be enough to accommodate two people separately , even in @entity30 in 2014			2
’ the deed details the rights of occupancy and it is the interpretation of this that has led to the court case			0
mr @entity11 said he helped to purchase the home so that his mother would have ‘ somewhere safe to see out her days ’			1
but mr @entity66 said the deed of trust was also supposed to be an investment that he would inherit after his mother ’s death			0
mrs @entity6 claims that the deed was intended to provide a home for the rest of her life just for her			0
when her son said he ’d like to ‘ spend more time there ’ , the pair began rowing			2
by december 2012 , she had banished him from the home and changed the locks after he allegedly allowed strangers to lodge in the house , the court heard			0
battle : the county court hearing took place inside the @entity130 ( pictured ) in central @entity30 mr @entity66 , on claims that his client had harassed his mother , said : ‘ the allegations consist of a number of telephone calls , a single instance of unspecified abuse in person , and a malicious call to the @entity140			2
’ @entity141 , for mrs @entity6 , said she was within her rights to prevent her son living in the home			0
‘ there is evidence that mr @entity11 allowed strangers into the house as lodgers , ’ he said			0
he also argued that mr @entity11 had no right to occupy the house under the trust deed			0
judge @entity153 reserved her judgment following the three - day hearing and will give her decision at a later date .			0

@entity11 and his mother @entity23 , 79 , are each suing each other
he paid for three - quarters of her home in @entity29 , @entity30 , in 2001
its value has since *soared* from a £ 200,000 ' right to buy ' to £ 1.2million
falling - out reached its peak in 2012 after he spent more time at home
he is demanding his mother lets him back in , or they sell and split profits
but she is demanding her son pays damages for alleged harassment
