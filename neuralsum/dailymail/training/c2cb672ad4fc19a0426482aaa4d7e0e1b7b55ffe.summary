the transfer window has finally shut after a summer of spending and a typically manic deadline day			1
plenty of clubs will be happy with their dealings , while others will rue the ones who got away as £ 850million was splurged			1
here , @entity10 charts the winners and losers from the summer window ... spend , spend , spend : @entity15 clubs splashed out more than £ 850m in the transfer window winners @entity18 : probably the biggest winners overall , buying well in the positions they needed to			1
@entity18 had a clear plan of the flow of players in and out of @entity25 and struck early meaning @entity26 could spend transfer deadline day relatively stress free			1
new additions @entity30 and @entity32 have made superb starts already			1
@entity34 : @entity35 was the standout performer on transfer deadline day			2
he pulled off something of a coup , bringing in @entity39 from @entity40 and @entity41 from @entity42 on the final day , to add some flair to a solid team			1
add in club record signing , @entity47 striker @entity46 , and it speaks a lot about @entity34 ’s ambition			2
it was a relatively low key window but they managed to retain the signatures of key players while bolstering an already strong squad with shrewd purchases , like tough tackling @entity66 and @entity67 , who they identified as targets early on			2
@entity70 : @entity71 had a big money pot to play with from the £ 75m @entity74 transfer			1
he brought in nine players to bolster a squad that was sometimes short of depth last season			0
@entity79 is a risky but potentially inspired signing			1
@entity81 and @entity82 are likely to be key figures			0
@entity84 : there were nervous moments for fans who thought the window might pass without a striker being signed to replace the injured @entity90			2
the deal for @entity92 went through at the death			0
while not a prolific goalscorer he has a great work rate and will be keen to impress at the @entity97 and retain his @entity99 spot			0
keen to impress : @entity92 , mocked up here in an @entity84 shirt , is a good buy for the @entity106 losers @entity42 : @entity108 has done a sterling job of rebuilding after the heart was ripped out of this team , with several high profile departures			0
the club has reinvested some of the money in @entity117 @entity116 and @entity118 who both look bright on early inspection			0
there is reason to be optimistic but this squad is ultimately weaker than last season			0
@entity125 : spent plenty and two eyecatching signings but few spectators watched a dreary 0 - 0 against @entity129 last week and thought what @entity130 most needed was a top quality striker			1
while @entity134 is a nice luxury it is a bit like laying a new floor when the roof is leaking			2
weaknesses in central midfield and defence will need to be papered over			0
surprise losers : despite signing @entity134 and @entity143 , @entity125 had a poor window @entity145 : this window has been by no means a disaster for @entity145 , who signed the versatile @entity148 on deadline day , but it has been slightly underwhelming			1
they missed out on @entity92 to north @entity152 rivals @entity84 and failed to land the superb @entity153 from @entity42			0
@entity154 will have to work with what he already has			0
@entity40 : things started brightly on @entity157 with long - term targets @entity159 and @entity160 secured			2
but a lack of investment has left them short all over the pitch			1
the departure of talented @entity39 to @entity34 will come as a blow to fans who have been disappointed to see the playmaker marginalised by @entity169			0
@entity129 : a limited transfer budget has meant @entity129 bought in bulk but with little emphasis on quality			0
@entity175 and @entity176 , both bought on transfer deadline day , are both promising youngsters but unproven at the highest level , while @entity180 failed to make the grade at @entity34 last season			0
failed to make the grade : @entity180 was @entity129 's big signing but has n't cut it in the @entity15 @entity185 completes £ 6m season long loan deal to @entity187			1

@entity18 were biggest winners after signing @entity30
@entity56 keeping their stars means they *'re* in good shape
@entity79 is a potentially inspiring signing
@entity125 should have signed a defender , not @entity134
lack of investment has left @entity40 short
@entity15 clubs spent £ 850m in the transfer window
