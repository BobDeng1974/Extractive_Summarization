this is the man named as an alleged serial child abuser 13 years ago by victims of the @entity4 grooming scandal			1
yet despite being accused of vile crimes by 18 young girls , @entity5 was never questioned by police			1
now , though , officers are investigating @entity5 , who these days is confined to a wheelchair following a shooting			1
but @entity5 was not questioned about the allegations and police are only investigating the 39 - year - old father in the wake of last week ’s report into the @entity4 scandal by professor @entity27			1
yesterday one alleged victim said it was ‘ unbelievable ’ young girls had not been protected			1
@entity31 – not her real name – got into a relationship with the violent man she knew as ‘ @entity35 ’ when she was 14 and he was 24			2
she claimed he was controlling and aggressive but police dismissed her concerns and those of her parents			1
they did not question him even after she made an official statement			2
she said : ‘ i just think it is disgraceful			2
it was n’t just me , there were so many of us and nothing was ever done			0
’ for two years she believed she was in love with @entity5 , who had been married twice by the time she met him			1
her parents did everything they could to stop the relationship			0
they even put her into care in a bid to separate them – but carers openly allowed him to see her and she twice became pregnant by him			0
she went to police aged 16 after realising she ‘ could n’t take ’ any more , but said she was treated with derision			2
victim : @entity31 ( left ) , not her real name , thought she was in love with ' @entity35 ' ( right ) when she was just 14 on one occasion , she claimed , she called police saying she was scared because @entity5 was sat outside her house in his car but was told because she lived on a main road he was allowed to be there			1
@entity31 said : ‘ he should have been arrested and questioned and taken to court			2
to not even question him is just unbelievable			0
’ the former deputy leader of @entity71 , @entity70 , is a cousin of @entity5 and lives a few doors from his family home			1
mr @entity70 was accused in a report in @entity75 last year of helping to arrange a deal where @entity5 returned one of his young alleged victims who had gone missing from home to police			1
crime tsar @entity81 defiantly repeated his refusal to quit yesterday in the wake of the @entity4 grooming scandal			0
the @entity86 insisted he will complete his term of office – but announced that he will not seek re-election to the £ 85,000 - a - year post in 2016			0
mr @entity81 , @entity71 cabinet member for children ’s services between 2005 and 2010 , apologised again for his role in the ‘ systematic failure ’ which allowed the scandal to go undetected for so long , adding : ‘ i wish i knew then what i do now			0
’ the 46 - year - old has faced calls to step down from @entity99 , @entity100 and the @entity101 , and faces questioning by the @entity104 home affairs select committee over the scandal in the next few days			0
he had refused interviews in the days after professor @entity27 ’s damning report but broke his silence to tell the mail : ‘ if i stepped down now , it would take two months to elect a successor and a by - election will cost £ 1.5million			2
‘ somebody will be elected without the knowledge i have			0
i came into public life to make a difference and i am still in a position where i can make that difference			0
' i genuinely think i am the best person to take this forward			0
when i took over , there were just two or three officers working on child sexual exploitation			0
’ mr @entity70 has denied protecting @entity5 or knowing about any inappropriate relationships			1
@entity5 was named as a ‘ boyfriend ’ by up to 18 girls who spoke to social workers as part of the risky business outreach group , aimed at youngsters who were at risk of being lured into prostitution			1
the council - funded project , which has since been absorbed into the council ’s safeguarding team , allegedly passed his name to police in 2001			1
professor @entity27 ’s report said @entity142 was often the only agency to take victims seriously but was ‘ too often seen as something of a nuisance , particularly by children ’s social care ’			2
@entity5 was shot in the stomach in 2005 and now uses a wheelchair			1
he and his wife @entity150 moved to a council bungalow near @entity152 , @entity153 , around a year ago			0
@entity5 refused to speak to the @entity110 and his solicitor @entity154 did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the allegations			1
@entity86 said : ‘ a number of investigations looking at historical sexual offences in @entity4 are currently ongoing			0
‘ these are large - scale investigations and are very much live and dynamic			0
we would be compromising those investigations if we were to provide any details at this stage			0

18 girls allegedly named @entity5 , 39 , as their ' boyfriend ' in 2001
but he was never questioned by police who ' dismissed concerns '
now he will be *quizzed* as report found *1,400* girls were abused in the town
