by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:24 est , 24 february 2014 killed : @entity5 @entity4 leader @entity3 , pictured , was killed in a suicide attack on a compound in the northern @entity5 city of @entity9 two suicide bombers killed a senior @entity14 operative on sunday , blowing themselves up inside the militant leader 's compound in the northern @entity5 city of @entity9 , rebels and activists said			1
the killing of @entity18 , who rebels said was serving as @entity14 chief @entity21 's representative in @entity5 , falls against the backdrop of bloody rebel infighting between an @entity14 - breakaway group known as the @entity25 , and an array of ultraconservative and more moderate opposition fighters			1
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for sunday 's assassination , but rebels quickly accused the @entity32			1
@entity33 had been critical of the group , reportedly blaming it for the internecine conflict among rebels that has killed thousands of people across northern @entity5 since it began in early january			1
if an @entity32 role in @entity3 's death is confirmed , it could further complicate efforts to resolve the infighting , which has undermined rebel efforts to oust president @entity45 in @entity5 's nearly 3 - year civil war			1
since the rebel - on - rebel clashes began , government forces have chipped away at opposition - held areas , including around @entity9			1
a native @entity5 with longstanding ties to @entity14 , @entity3 was a co-founder of @entity53 , a prominent , hard - line rebel group in @entity5 that is part of a powerful alliance of seven groups known as the @entity57			1
@entity58 , a spokesman for the @entity57 , described @entity3 as " a big figure in global jihad , " and said he was appointed by @entity61 last year to mediate a dispute between the two @entity14 affiliates in @entity5 : the @entity32 and the @entity64			2
high - ranking : assassinated @entity18 was said to be serving as the representative in @entity5 of @entity14 chief @entity21 , pictured speaking via @entity67 , @entity66 said @entity3 had criticized the @entity32 for its antagonistic approach toward other rebel factions			1
he said rebels believe the @entity32 , which @entity14 publicly disowned earlier this month , was behind sunday 's bombing			2
' the first fingers of blame point to the state , ' @entity58 said			2
' unfortunately this is going to make the infighting worse			1
' he did not provide any evidence to support his assertion that the @entity32 had a hand in @entity3 's killing			2
the @entity83 - based @entity82 said two others were also killed in the attack , which it attributed to the @entity32			1

@entity33 had long been on the radar of @entity94 intelligence agencies			0
in 2002 , @entity96 officials described @entity3 , whose real name is @entity98 , as the courier for the late terrorist leader @entity100 between @entity101 and @entity102			0
islamic extremists have emerged as a powerful force in @entity5 's civil war			0
the rise to prominence of hard - line @entity25 militants like @entity3 has sent jitters through @entity94 capitals , and dampened enthusiasm for the @entity113 opposition			0
@entity114 , an analyst with the @entity115 , said @entity3 's activities in @entity5 had been a source of concern for the @entity119 and its allies			0
" he is essentially a core @entity14 veteran who almost certainly ... had extensive , close relations with ( @entity100 ) @entity100 , " and other senior leaders , @entity114 said			1
" the fact that he had such a high position in @entity53 , and confirmed it himself , his @entity14 history â € ” it made elements in the @entity119 administration potentially consider @entity53 as a terrorist organization			0
" @entity5 's uprising began with largely peaceful protests in march 2011 before turning into a civil war that has killed more than 140,000 people			1
the conflict has also forced 2.5 million to flee the country , left millions more in desperate need of aid and caused immense suffering across the nation			2
on saturday , the @entity141 @entity140 passed a resolution demanding immediate access everywhere in @entity5 for humanitarian aid			0
the resolution , which marked a rare instance of unity on the security council , does n't threaten sanctions but it does express the council 's intention to take " further steps " if the resolution is n't implemented @entity5 's @entity152 on sunday welcomed the resolution , voiced its readiness to cooperate but said that top priority must be respecting national sovereignty			0
it also said that to address the humanitarian crisis demanding dealing with " foreign - backed terrorism			0
" @entity158 says the crisis in the country is caused by an international conspiracy against @entity5			0
also sunday , a car bomb exploded near a charity field hospital close to the @entity164 border , wounding mostly medics and patients who had fled violence elsewhere in the country , activists and @entity164 media said			0
@entity164 ambulance crews evacuated at least 11 of the wounded , including a 5 - month - old baby , to @entity164 , said @entity5 activists of the @entity175			0
