by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:00 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 9 december 2013 a top economist says @entity5 leader @entity4 's plan to cap energy bills will cripple the @entity8 's energy infrastructure @entity4 ’s pledge to freeze energy prices has been savaged by the leader of the world ’s most influential economic group			1
@entity14 , of the @entity15 , says it will destroy investment in the energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights on			1
mr @entity4 said in september that he will freeze energy prices for 20 months if @entity5 wins the general election in 2015			1
the commitment is credited with keeping his party high in the opinion polls , although new research claims it has wiped billions off the value of shares in energy firms			1
but mr @entity14 says a freeze on bills takes no account of the fluctuating international cost of energy			1
in an interview with @entity35 tonight , he says some energy firms could be left bankrupt by the plan , which would deter investors just when @entity8 needs more energy infrastructure			1
he adds : ‘ if you freeze the price of energy and the international price of energy rises it means there ’s going to be a very big difference to pay			1
who ’s going to pay the difference ? are you going to ask the investors to take the difference ? ‘ they ’ll probably go bankrupt			2
how are you going to get people to come in and invest to get their money back in 30 , 40 years ’ time , when you are saying there ’s going to be a freeze ? ‘ i think this is simply not consistent , not economically objective			1
’ the investment bank @entity58 said yesterday that £ 6.7billion has been wiped off energy shares in @entity8 since mr @entity4 pledged on september 24 to freeze bills			1
it said that if @entity8 ’s listed utility companies had kept pace with similar firms in @entity67 , their value would be around £ 11billion higher now			1
@entity14 , of the @entity15 , says it will destroy investment in the energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights on the chief executive of @entity73 said that @entity8 needs new energy infrastructure because the country could soon be close to an energy shortfall , raising the spectre of blackouts			1
@entity79 said : ‘ the amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down from about 15 per cent to this winter when we ’ll be about 5 per cent			0
next winter will be even smaller			0
the leadership of @entity4 has been ‘ a considerable gift to the @entity89 ’ , @entity5 peer @entity85 said yesterday			0
the film producer said the @entity92 ’s brother @entity91 would have given the government ‘ a much tougher time ’			0
he accused mr @entity4 of beating @entity91 to the position with a ‘ bloc vote ’ by trade unions – and said he lacked experience			0
@entity85 spoke out as it emerged @entity4 is seeking advice from @entity101 big hitters			0
a leaked memo shows he consults @entity103 every month , and @entity101 ‘ ultra ’ @entity104 every six weeks			0
others to be consulted include : former @entity109 aides @entity107 and @entity110 ; @entity112 press officer @entity111 ; and adviser @entity113			0
‘ so will we get through this winter ? yes			0
will we get through next winter ? i do n’t know			0
’ @entity116 boss @entity115 also called for ‘ massive ’ infrastructure investment			2
@entity5 energy spokesman @entity118 said excess energy company profits had pushed customer bills too high , and the price freeze was necessary			1
she added : ‘ the public have been overcharged			0
wholesale prices dropped substantially in 2009			2
that was never reflected in a pass on to consumers			0
there ’s been a distortion ever since			0
’ but mr @entity79 said it was unfair to criticise the profits of the so - called @entity132 energy firms			1
‘ in 2012 we made about a 3.5 per cent margin , ’ he said			0
‘ that is hardly excessive			0
unfortunately ... suppliers are the easiest thing to shoot at			0
warnings of an energy shortfall came as sir @entity140 , the government ’s chief scientific adviser , said shale gas could produce new energy but create less carbon dioxide than coal , adding : ‘ it ’s a better fuel			2
as part of a fuel mix to a low - carbon future , it ’s a sensible thing to do			2
’ meanwhile , @entity149 , the firm fracking for shale gas , yesterday said it had found enough in @entity151 to fuel @entity8 for 50 years			1
@entity153 boss @entity152 compared the potential to that of @entity157 oil and pledged that the public in fracking areas would benefit to the tune of billions of pounds			2
he added : ‘ there is so much gas that we can give the supernormal profits to the people it belongs to – the people of @entity8			1
we want to give away billions			2

@entity170 freeze takes no account of fluctuating energy prices , says expert
it could deter much - needed investment into the @entity8 grid
billions has been wiped off value of energy firms ' sharers since pledge
