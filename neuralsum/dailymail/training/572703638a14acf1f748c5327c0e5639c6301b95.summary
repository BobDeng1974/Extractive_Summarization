by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 06:59 est , 26 september 2013 @entity1 may have scooped the award for @entity3 in a @entity5 category for her role in @entity7 at this years 65th @entity8 , but it was her hair that caused the biggest storm when she stepped onto the red carpet			1
with her usually shoulder length locks seemingly chopped into a soft bob , the 34 - year - old actress revealed to @entity16 read carpet presenter @entity17 that her crop was in fact fake			1
rather than committing to a haircut , the actress had her hair carefully styled into a ‘ fob ’ , or faux bob , and here @entity23 shows you how to copy this chic style			1
keep your hair on ! @entity7 's @entity1 pulls hair fake - out with ' faux bob ' when she hit the red carpet at the 65th @entity8 on monday @entity1 , who won the award fro best actress in a @entity5 this year ( left ) for her role as a troubled @entity34 agent in @entity7 , sported a much longer hair do at last years @entity8 ( right ) celebrity hair dresser @entity36 , who has worked with the likes of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and supermodels @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , shows us how			1
@entity36 said of @entity1 ’s red carpet look : ‘ the bob is a classic – it 's the fast track to elegant and a great way to show off high gloss healthy locks , it 's age versatile and there 's an interpretation that works for all face shapes and hair colours			1
‘ it 's an iconic look and will always work for the timeless glamour we like to see on the red carpet			1
i love that @entity1 rocked the fake			1
’ @entity36 says that the right tools and preparation are essential for @entity23 readers hoping to create the perfect ‘ fob ’ where you are after a ' fob ' or a full - on bob , @entity36 says make sure you get the right style for you			1
' ask what length overall and type of fringe or not will suit your face shape , age and lifestyle			0
' a longer version with soft fringe will be easier to maintain and easier to wear			0
do ask also about colour choices , particularly on blonde tones , as they need to match skin tones which change with age , just to ensure they flatter and do n't appear harsh			0
' ask about the amount of layers cut into a bob – too many results in a loss of shape and the hair kicks out instead of in which is the signature look of a bob			2
' finally , the the minimum length of a bob i feel for best flattering features should be to the jaw line , anything above is quite difficult to pull off and is n't for everyone ' he says : ' after a barrel brush blow dry to really smooth out all of the hair , use pins to literally mould the hair and push it underneath itself , rolled almost to the desired bob length			2
‘ faking on longer hair in this way creates a natural vintage movement with the thickness of the hair once it 's doubled up on itself			0
use @entity110 to mould ( use on wet hair before the blow dry ) and @entity114 to set without stiffness			0
' ' a smooth , healthy , high shine finish is the key to all interpretations of the bob , so product preparation and the right styling tools are essential			1
build in moisture before a barrel brush blow dry with @entity124 applied from mid length to ends			0
' once dry , finish with a heated styling tool that locks in moisture and delivers shine			2
my @entity131 has built in @entity133 to infuse a shot of the hair 's naturally produced protein , visible on the finish			0
use a non-sticky spray to finish that allows movement			0
' the mother - of - one arrived as a nominee in the @entity3 in a @entity5 category for her role in @entity7 , but the star left as a winner			0
@entity1 appeared at the @entity146 's @entity145 on saturday with her normal long blonde locks she also stunned on the red carpet , wearing an @entity150 couture lace gown with a neckline slashed down to the navel , paired with subtle @entity154 jewellery and @entity156 shoes			1
however some critics thought the actress looked too skinny , drawing attention to her jutting collar bones and flat chest			0
@entity1 may have faked hers , but there was no doubt that bobs were as on trend as pale pastel dresses on the red carpet this year			1
@entity170 's @entity169 's bob was sleek and side - parted , while @entity171 added edge to her chic bob with a bias cut and @entity175 softened hers with layers and a sweeping fringe			2
@entity36 says : @entity169 's smooth , glossy , side - parted version brought great class to her overall look			2
' january @entity181 also opted for a short cut , though with a curled tousled look , which was also adopted by @entity184 and fellow @entity185 star @entity185			0
@entity169 @entity171 and @entity175 ( @entity186 ) kept it sleek and elegant @entity184 and @entity188 and @entity185 ( @entity186 ) all chose to keep their bobs tousled			0

@entity1 wowed with a sleek bob on the @entity8 red carpet
admitted that it was created with *clever* styling not a haircut
