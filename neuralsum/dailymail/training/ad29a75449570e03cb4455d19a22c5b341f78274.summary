' we have high expectations			0
we wo n’t make a mediocre movie , this is a once in a generation opportunity to reinterpret @entity8 for a 21st century audience , ' @entity17 said			1
' ultimately we 've got the passion and we have the commitment but we need to partner with great writers and great film - makers and i think that right combination will empower us to do what we want to do			0
' @entity17 's impressive career spans over decades with films such as @entity90 and @entity91 under his belt			2
he knows what it takes to reinterpret a classic icon and bring him to the big screen and believes @entity8 needs to be taken into the @entity97 to be a success			2
the producer believes we are living in ' an exciting time ' in film for the convergence of life - action , animation and visual effects and says anything is possible			0
@entity17 produced @entity5 last year it was a huge shock for @entity9 that @entity5 was n't nominated for an @entity108 this year ' we ca n’t stick to the tv series and we ’re certainly not going to be referencing the 2009 animated movie			1
we really want us to reinterpret him in a very contemporary way			0
' ' if you look at @entity115 and more recently @entity13 and before that @entity90 or the @entity117 movie they 're all very different but they all have one thing in common which is they break new ground , ' he said , this will be the fist time @entity8 will have ever been made into a @entity52 blockbuster film			2
@entity16 's @entity125 have been very careful about who they let lay their hands on their prized possession			0
' they wanted to make sure that whoever did it would do justice to the property , ' @entity17 said			2
@entity91 won an @entity134 in 2007 @entity17 produced and worked on visual effects for the widely acclaimed film ' there has been an explosion in this type of film in the last half a decade particularly and i think it ’s a great time to bring him to the big screen as a live action superhero			1
' whether it ’s @entity147 or @entity72 or @entity73 there is just such a love from audiences for this type of property so the timing is perfect			0
@entity17 and @entity9 are in the pre-production stages of the next instalment of the @entity13 movies			0
the first one will be called @entity156 , based on a @entity13 toy line and the second film will go by the name @entity160 , to be directed by @entity161 who co-directed the first film			0
the company is also working on a @entity165 movie , in collaboration with @entity168 's @entity167			0

@entity17 produced @entity90 in 2013 the animation film depicted what it was like when dinosaurs walked the earth ' it really supports out animation industry in @entity4 and it supports long - term creative jobs so it ’s not just about the films it ’s about the industry as well			1
we ’re really pleased it solidifies the position we ’re in in @entity4			0
' in 2006 , @entity17 's work on @entity91 contributed to the monumental @entity108 win for the penguin film			1
however , he says he is ' perplexed ' that @entity5 was n't even nominated for an @entity108 nod this year			1
' i feel perplexed and disappointed and that ’s being really honest , ' @entity17 said			2
' if you look at the amount of news that was generated when the @entity108 were announced there was more news generated around why @entity13 did n't get a nomination than any other nomination actually announced so we were n't the only ones perplexed			1
' @entity17 worked on visual effects for @entity117			0
the film won over critics and was hailed a success @entity206 worked with @entity17 on the film			2
@entity208 and @entity209 were the stars from @entity17 's point of view , @entity5 was ' the most ground - breaking and most challenging animated film that was produced last year '			1
' it found the biggest audience in @entity214 of any animated film produced last year so all i can think is the @entity217 maybe was a little bit unsure because it was a toy brand			0
perhaps they did n't understand the complexity of the film because we made it look too easy			0
' @entity17 said the @entity217 like to hold on to traditional methods of film making and believes there are not enough categories at the awards for animation movies			2
' there ’s not enough slots because if the @entity217 wants to keep supporting traditional animation and recognise innovative animation and animated story - telling , perhaps five slots is not enough			0
the funny thing the only bad review we had about @entity13 was someone actually said that they got sick of laughing so hard in the first 20 minutes			0
