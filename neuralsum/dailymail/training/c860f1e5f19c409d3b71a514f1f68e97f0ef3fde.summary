although the jury took under four hours to find @entity1 guilty of dragging miss @entity11 from her bike , raping her and then strangling her to death with her own bra , the defendant defiantly maintained his innocence throughout			1
as the sentence was passed he addressed judge @entity17 , saying : ' i understand how the family feel about their loss , but how can you clearly say i did anything ? jailed for life : @entity1 ( left ) was found guilty of raping and murdering @entity11 ( right ) ' i did n’t do nothing			1
i understand where they coming from , but i did n’t have nobody die the way they said			2
i did n’t have no interaction with her			2

he told @entity1 his refusal to accept responsibility was ' in keeping with your history of a lack of remorse			1

around 30 of miss @entity11 's relatives and friends were present , and her family gave victim impact statements to the court before the sentencing			1

' miss @entity11 's aunt @entity76 added : ' he [ @entity1 ] has no idea what he did to all of us			1
he should never ever be able to walk on the same ground that @entity6 did			0

' @entity84 reported that @entity1 had previously admitted the attack on @entity86 , saying he had only meant to steal her bicycle			1
he allegedly said he killed her because she screamed when he tried to take the bike			0
he later retracted the confession , which his lawyers claim he made only because he is mentally challenged			0

@entity7 district attorney @entity99 said in a statement : ' my heart continues to go out to @entity6 's family and friends			2
i hope this verdict will give them some sense of justice			2

' i hope the rest of society is satisfied as well , ' he said			0
while they have now received the verdict they had yearned for , the @entity11 family have waited almost two years to watch their daughter 's killer get life			1
a dog walker found the young woman 's body , which was naked apart from a pair of beige socks , on 2 june 2010			0
during the first two days of @entity1 's trial , the jury heard how he grabbed his 5 ' 3 , 100lb victim when she was riding her pink and grey bike home from a night out			1
he grabbed her at the front of her apartment building , before dragging her 120ft to the rear of her home , where he raped and then killed her			0
assistant district attorney @entity147 told the court that @entity11 was : ' tiny , small , petite but so vulnerable			1
' he said @entity1 's stalking of her on a bicycle , which was captured on cctv to be played later on in the trial , happened because : ' he knew he could dominate , overwhelm and control her			1
' he claimed @entity1 left his dna ' all over her , inside of her ' and said ' he destroyed her ' during the attack			1
defence attorney @entity161 rejected the claims , arguing that even dna experts were capable of making mistakes			0
a forensic psychologist , @entity165 , then testified that @entity1 had an iq of just 73 , and had most likely been born with brain damage			1

' it was just like touching a piece of glass , ' she said			0
' that was somebody 's child and i did n't want her to be alone			0
' other witnesses said they found a man 's dirty t - shirt and miss @entity11 's purse in the hours after the murder			2
assistant medical examiner @entity192 , who performed the autopsy , said the ligature which ended miss @entity11 's life was ' one of the tightest ' he had seen			2

defiant to the last , @entity1 asked judge , ' how can you clearly say i did anything ? '
