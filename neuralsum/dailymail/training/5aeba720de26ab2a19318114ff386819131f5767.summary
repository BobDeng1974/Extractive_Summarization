‘ we had been to the pub up the road and were coming back to my house through the gate ' , he went on			0
' it was pitch black and we were using torches to navigate our way back and the big stag must have got trapped in the garden as we have deer fences around it			2
' it must have panicked when it saw us and the only way out was through the gate that we were standing at			0
it just ran at us and went straight through us			0
‘ @entity10 was at the back of the group and its antlers must have caught her in the neck			2
the stag then made for the hills			0
it was a completely freakish accident , i ’ve never seen the like of it before			0
dangerous : the animal 's antlers pierced dr @entity29 's throat , leaving her in critical condition ( file picture ) ‘ i think i know the one it is , it ’s been hanging around			1
it ’s a three - year - old stag , around 150kg			0

holiday : the group had been at a ceilidh at the @entity186 ( pictured ) before being invited to mr @entity127 's home where the attack occurred the group was approaching this gate when the stag seemingly panicked and charged dr @entity29 who was the tallest in the group a young stag pictured crossing the road in @entity12 where dr @entity29 was staying with friends before the attack owner @entity197 , 51 , said : ‘ no one here has heard of anything like this in their lifetime , it has shocked the community			1
‘ it ’s a cornered stag with no alternative exit route , it would have just been in a panic			0
it had nowhere else to go but through the group and unfortunately it seems @entity10 was in the way			2
‘ the force of the attack and impact must have been ferocious			0
i went to the scene later and found @entity10 ’s mobile phone smashed into tiny bits			2
‘ i understand the type of injury @entity10 has suffered can cause quadriplegia or paraplegia			2
she was telling me she enjoyed the outdoors in the hills and camping on her own in remote places , so any form of paralysis to such an active person will be a disaster			0
’ one local gamekeeper with more than 40 years of experience with @entity234 stags said he had never heard of such an incident			0
he added : ‘ for a stag to come out of the darkness like this and go for someone is highly unusual – a chance in a million			0
