@entity0 has hit back at critics who labelled him greedy when he quit @entity2 for @entity3 by saying : ' it 's not about money – i wanted to boost my career			1
' the @entity9 full - back has finally joined @entity3 after months of wrangling , having turned down offers from @entity2 to renew his contract , which ends this month			1
and after helping @entity14 through to the last 16 of the @entity15 in wednesday night 's goalless draw with @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity0 hit back at the rumours he had been trying to simply hike up his wages at @entity2 , pointing out that he had been on the same deal at the @entity22 for the past six years			1
' but he was keen to clarify why he turned down @entity30 's offers to stay at @entity2			1
' i ’m going to clear everything up because i keep reading that i did it for money and i ’m greedy , ' he said			2
' what i want to say is i have stayed with @entity2 on the same contract since 2008 and i never asked for more money			1
' for people who think it ’s for money , it ’s not			2
i just wanted to change			2
i needed a boost in my career and i think it was about time			0
' it was not an easy time because we were still involved in the @entity46 and it was hard to stay focused			0
i stayed focused on my team because i have a lot of respect for @entity2			1

i told my family to keep away from speculation and i stayed focused			0
' tearful exit : @entity0 's last game for @entity2 was in their 3 - 2 @entity46 final victory against @entity59 in may high note : the @entity46 victory was the only trophy @entity0 won during his seven - year spell at @entity2 and although he finally won his first trophy with @entity2 when they beat @entity59 in the @entity46 final last month , he admits going to join @entity65 will give him the chance of @entity67 and @entity69 glory			1
' it is an exciting time for me and my career			0
i think we have a good team with @entity3 and we can do great things			1
' @entity2 made me grow up as a player and as a man as well			1
we finally won a trophy , but it ’s not even about that because @entity2 have a quality			2
' it ’s just that , personally , i wanted a boost			0
i needed to start again			0
' and @entity0 is not worried about competing with @entity85 star @entity84 for the right - back position			1
' i know they have a very good right - back in @entity89 and i will have to fight to find some time on the pitch			2
but i ’m looking forward to it			0
' before joining up with his new team - mates , @entity0 believes he can help @entity14 win the @entity15 , with the experience of manager @entity94 a decisive factor			1
the @entity9 crashed out of the past two tournaments after internal rows between players and staff , but @entity0 says @entity94 has brought harmony to the camp – and has the experience of winning the @entity15 in 1998			1
he said : ' we have started very well , so we have to be ambitious			0
' in the past we were maybe too arrogant , too confident			0
sometimes it ’s good to start from the bottom			0
we ’ve worked hard as a team for a few years and today we are here			0
we have managed a good start to the @entity15 and we want to go to the end			2
