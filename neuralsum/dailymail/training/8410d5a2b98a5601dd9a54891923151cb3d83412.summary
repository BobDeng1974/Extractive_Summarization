humans have evolved to look physically different from each other because our eyes play such an important role in social interactions , research suggests			1
most animal species use smell or sound to identify each other - but people rely primarily on sight to differentiate individuals			1
many animals are visually almost indistinguishable from each other , particularly those which are active at night			0
researchers from @entity17 compared dna from around the world			1
they found genetic regions controlling facial features were more varied than those influencing other body parts			1
this indicated that facial variation in humans ( left ) has an evolutionary advantage , compared to other more identical - looking species ( right ) but humans have developed to be physically unique , according to the new research , giving rise to a wide variety in hair colours , eye pigmentation , height and facial features			1
behavioural ecologist dr @entity37 , from the @entity38 , said : ‘ humans are phenomenally good at recognising faces ; there is a part of the brain specialised for that			0
researchers from the @entity38 compared dna from around the world			1
they found that genetic regions controlling facial characteristics were more varied than those influencing other parts of the body			1
this was a clear sign that facial variation had an evolutionary advantage			1
facial traits were also independent of each other , unlike most body measures			2
people with longer arms tend to have longer legs			0
but individuals with wide noses or widely spaced eyes do not have longer noses , for example			0
the most variable facial traits lie within the triangle of the eyes , mouth and nose , the researchers found			1
they assessed human facial variability with the help of a 1988 @entity76 database of personnel body measurements			2
‘ our study now shows that humans have been selected to be unique and easily recognisable			0
it is clearly beneficial for me to recognise others , but also beneficial for me to be recognisable			0
otherwise we would all look more similar			0
’ the scientists , whose findings are reported in the journal @entity86 , showed that facial traits are much more variable than body features such as the length of the hand			2
facial traits were also independent of each other , unlike most body measures			2
people with longer arms tend to have longer legs			0
but individuals with wide noses or widely spaced eyes do not have longer noses , for example			0
comparing dna from around the world showed that genetic regions controlling facial characteristics were more varied than those influencing other parts of the body			1
this was a clear sign that facial variation had an evolutionary advantage			1
co-author professor @entity109 said : ‘ lots of regions of the genome contribute to facial features , so you would expect the genetic variation to be subtle , and it is			1
but it is consistent and statistically significant			0

these charts show the correlation between width and height of hands and noses the scientists also used data from the @entity145 , which has catalogued nearly 40 million genetic variations among humans worldwide			2
‘ genetic variation tends to be weeded out by natural selection in the case of traits that are essential to survival , ’ said prof @entity109			1
‘ here it is the opposite - selection is maintaining variation			0
all of this is consistent with the idea that there has been selection for variation to facilitate recognition of individuals			0

researchers from @entity17 compared dna from around the world

this was a clear sign that facial variation had an evolutionary advantage
experts claim this is because humans rely on sight to identify individuals
*traditionally* , genetic variation is weeded out to ensure a species ' survival
this research suggests variation is *deliberately* maintained in humans
