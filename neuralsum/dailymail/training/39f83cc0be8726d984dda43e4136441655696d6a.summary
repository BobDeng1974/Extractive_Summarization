by @entity0 he arrived at the @entity1 in 1835 in a woman 's coffin , wearing a pink skirt and appeared to have breasts			1
so , not surprisingly , perhaps , for decades experts there described the @entity9 mummy in their guide books as the preserved remains of a ' dancing woman '			1
there was the itchy question of why the embalmer had drawn a beard on ' her ' face , but it was not until the 1960s when the body was x-rayed that questions over its gender began to be seriously raised			1

for decades experts there described the @entity9 mummy in their guide books as the preserved remains of a ' dancing woman '			1
now they 've discovered the embalmed body is actually a man now , thanks to a hospital ct scanner , it has finally been confirmed that the mummy is , in fact , that of an adult male ... and his decolletage was the result of a couple of strategically placed bundles of cloth			1
similar padding had also been applied to plump out his thighs			0
scholars think both areas may have been specially padded because the man was fat and the embalmer was trying to recreate accurately his appearance during life			0
the tests also established that he was at least 20 years old , 5ft 6in tall , had lost five teeth - and would have suffered terrible pain from several dental abscesses			1
the mummy was originally part of a collection of @entity9 antiquities amassed by @entity60 , @entity61 consul general in @entity9 , in the 1820s			1
he is one of eight mummies to be virtually unwrapped in the museum 's @entity65 , @entity68 exhibition @entity69 , director of the @entity1 , said : ' this new technology is truly ground - breaking , allowing us to reconstruct and understand the lives of these individuals ' the ' electronic excavation ' of the man , thought to date from the 2nd century ad when @entity9 was under @entity78 rule , forms part of a new exhibition opening at the museum in central @entity82 tomorrow			1
an interactive visualisation shows him being gradually unwrapped			0
yesterday @entity85 , curator of the @entity1 's department of @entity9 and the @entity87 , said : ' there was a deliberate attempt to create his appearance and it may be that it was done because he was overweight			1
thanks to a hospital ct scanner , it has finally been confirmed that the mummy is , in fact , that of an adult male ' it is a highly unusual mummy altogether , with the arms , legs fingers and toes separately wrapped rather than the whole body being cocoooned in material			1
there are only a handful of other mummies like him in the world			0
' he also has a leather belt and several linen straps on his body			1
they are some sort of decoration but we do n't know what they symbolise			0
some depictions of @entity9 dancers show them wearing similar straps so he may have been a dancer after all			1
' the mummy was originally part of a collection of @entity9 antiquities amassed by @entity60 , @entity61 consul general in @entity9 , in the 1820s			1
it is thought it was originally from a tomb in @entity130 , but there are no documents to confirm this			2
when the @entity1 bought the mummy at an auction records do , however , show he had a short skirt or kilt around the waist which was once pink , although the colouring has now almost disappeared , and he was in a wooden coffin marked with the woman 's name @entity144			0
the coffin has been dated to 1300 - @entity146 , but dr @entity85 said the style of showing the mummy as if he was alive rather than physically idealised is of a much later period			2
there is no inscription on the trappings to identify the deceased			0
dr @entity85 said : ' what we do know is he would 've been from a high status family as the body was very carefully treated			2
' there is gold leaf on the body			2
the ancient @entity160 believed the gods had golden skin so it may have been to make the dead person god - like			1
' there is also a lotus flower , a symbol of re-birth , drawn in ink on each knee			0
' the mismatched coffin may have been the result of @entity160 reusing them to bury different people or the result of antiquities dealers in the 19th century matching good quality items with each other even if they did not belong together to increase the overall price			0
he is one of eight mummies to be virtually unwrapped in the museum 's @entity65 , @entity68 exhibition			0
the men , women and children lived along the banks of the @entity187 in @entity9 and @entity87 between @entity188 and @entity189 and their lives and deaths are now revealed in unprecedented detail			1
the images come from ct scanners - which are normally used to diagnose tumours , fractures and heart disease			2
the scanners use x-rays to produce images of slice after slice of the mummies			0
the information is then knitted together using software designed for the car industry			0
by calling up material of a specific density , it was possible to view bandages , skin or bone and so peel back layer after layer			0
the mummy of a child temple singer is also on display , with digital visualisations revealing developing teeth and long hair			0
she is depicted as a mature adult on the cartonnage , or casing , around her remains , but the tests indicate she was around seven - years - old			2
her name is known to be @entity227 from inscriptions on the cartonnage and she is thought to have died around @entity230			2
@entity69 , director of the @entity1 , said : ' this new technology is truly ground - breaking , allowing us to reconstruct and understand the lives of these individuals			2
' the exhibition runs until november 30 .			0

it was first thought the embalmed body was a *female* dancer from @entity9
the ' dancing girl ' appeared to have breasts - which are actually cloth
a hospital @entity245 allowed *researchers* to make *incredible* discovery
