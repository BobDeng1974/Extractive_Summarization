by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:24 est , 5 august 2012 updated : 18:57 est , 5 august 2012 fallen star : a dishevelled @entity3 , pictured near his @entity5 home earlier this year on a hot night in june , @entity3 is @entity6 - ing at @entity7 , a nightclub with arty pretensions in @entity9 , @entity5			1
@entity3 - famous at ten , a millionaire at 12 and a has - been at 15 - lives not far away in a magnificent £ 2 million loft apartment and can be found at @entity7 once a month plying what passes for his trade these days			1
on this night , there are absences to visit a back room , and when @entity3 and his coterie of friends return , they smell of marijuana			1
people who know him say he ’s worlds away from the character of @entity25 , the joyful young boy in @entity26 who charmed millions of movie - goers			1
today , skinny to the point of skeletal , @entity3 looks far older than his 31 years			1
his alabaster skin appears papery and his green eyes framed with blonde lashes add to the air of vulnerability which clings to him			1
a neighbour at the @entity38 near his home said that @entity3 now looks so bad she could easily confuse him with a tramp			1
he wears ‘ vintage ’ clothing from secondhand stores , in particular a brown leather women ’s jacket , and goes everywhere with his small group of friends			1
indeed , it transpires that @entity3 , a multi-millionaire thanks to his career as a child actor , has fallen into some unwholesome company			1
one @entity5 source said : ‘ he mixes with a crowd of rich kids who split their time between @entity56 and @entity5			1
they are a fast crowd			1
’ one fairly new development is a friendship with a rocker @entity60 , from a punk band called the @entity62			1
they are so close that @entity3 joined the group on a two - month tour of @entity66 recently , and took to the stage to duet with @entity60 on some of their dates			1
@entity60 is a fan of the drug ketamine ( originally designed to sedate horses )			1
disturbingly , he persuaded @entity3 to star in a ‘ ketamine - inspired ’ film , @entity73 , last year			1
shot on an @entity75 , it is both puerile and incomprehensible			1
@entity60 giggled : ‘ i was on a lot of ketamine at the time ... it ’s a ketamine classic			1
’ he ’s since laid off the drug somewhat , saying : ‘ i feel that it ’s given me brain damage			2
’ @entity60 , who lost a bandmate to a drug overdose , has brought @entity3 into the orbit of the notorious and hopelessly addicted @entity85 , another of his chums who also appeared in the film			2
so what are we to make of all this ? this february , @entity3 was pictured looking desperately unwell			2
in the photo , taken in @entity5 , he clutched a tin of @entity93 and looked as if he was ill or suffering some kind of addiction , although his publicist said he was ‘ in perfectly good health ’			2
last week , his story took a dramatic turn when the @entity100 published a claim that he is ‘ close to death ’ , thanks to addictions to prescription drugs and heroin			1
then , photos appeared of a pale and dishevelled @entity3 walking along a @entity109 street clutching his stomach and appearing to retch against an ivy - clad wall , adding fuel to the rumours that all is not well			2
heartbreak : culkin with his ex-girlfriend , actress @entity115 @entity3 ’s @entity116 , @entity117 , denies it all , calling the report ‘ ridiculously and impossibly fictitious ’			1
the staff at a @entity122 pharmacy store in @entity123 confirmed that @entity3 comes in ‘ fairly regularly ’ , but declined to comment further			2
however , the magazine ’s account of @entity3 ’s alleged addictions is extremely detailed			2
it claims he is spending £ 3,800 a month on drugs , a habit which has grown since he was dumped by his girlfriend of eight years , actress @entity115 , at the end of 2010			1
the magazine contends that @entity3 is ‘ hopelessly hooked ’ and quotes sources who say they have seen him use a mixture of drugs			1
they say he regularly shoots up heroin and the painkiller oxycodone - a semi-synthetic opiate sometimes used by cancer patients			2
he invites friends for poker parties , which turn into drugs binges with a ‘ close circle of whacked - out pals ’			1
a supposed insider told the magazine : ‘ he ’s been hooked for a year and a half ... @entity3 is surrounding himself with junkies and lowlifes			1
’ another pal allegedly said : ‘ @entity3 is surely dying			2
he ’s addicted to heroin , @entity153 and the painkillers @entity155 and @entity156			2
i have witnessed his drug - taking , which has escalated over the past year and a half to the point where he needs serious help			1
’ the friend says @entity3 buys 300 to 400 @entity156 and @entity155 painkillers every ten days at $ 5 per pill			2
but the high is no longer enough , so he ’s shooting up heroin and @entity153 , too			2
according to medical experts , the dangers are of a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmia			2
why would @entity3 play such a deadly game with his health ? @entity172 at 10 : the former child star made $ 70,000 for the first @entity26 movie and £ 3 million for the sequel according to the @entity100 , his descent began when he split with @entity115			1
he is apparently even more depressed since she started dating fellow actor @entity178 , who broke up with wife @entity179 last year			1
but there are other tragedies in the story of the fall of @entity3			2
raised with six siblings in a one - bedroom apartment , he started landing movie roles at eight			2
his father kit , an actor , started him out on his career when he was only four			2
he was a millionaire by ten , thanks to the first @entity26 film			0
he was paid £ 70,000 for that and £ 3 million for the sequel			0
‘ i ’d made enough money by the time i was 12 to never have to work again , ’ he told an interviewer			0
at the time , his @entity26 director , the late @entity196 , said of @entity3 : ‘ he ’s got a nice family who care about him , and he certainly has n’t suffered from all this working			0
’ but this was a woeful miscalculation			0
@entity3 later said that @entity200 ruled the family - ‘ his kingdom ’ - by humiliation , and that even when they all moved into a huge house in @entity5 , which was paid for by @entity3 , the bullying did not stop			0
in 2004 he said : ‘ my father was overbearing			0
he was always the way he is , even before my success			0
he ’d play mind games to make sure i knew my place			0
’ at 14 , @entity3 announced that he was quitting acting			0
the following year his father left , after which his mother @entity214 filed for custody of @entity3 and his siblings , igniting a bitter public battle with kit			1
eventually , @entity3 had his parents legally blocked from controlling his £ 11 million fortune — a move that estranged him for good from his father , who now lives in @entity223			0
all this - the overbearing father , the lawsuits - calls to mind parallel experiences in the life of @entity229 , who became a friend of @entity3 ’s just after the @entity26 films			0
@entity3 later recalled that @entity229 simply rang him up and invited him to come over and play video games			0
the reason for the friendship , he said , was that they were both eternally eight years old			0
@entity3 loyally testified during a 2009 trial , in which @entity229 was accused of molesting another boy , that the singer had never touched him inappropriately			0
having skipped his final year of high school , at 17 @entity3 married his sweetheart , @entity240			1
by the time he was 20 , they were divorced			0
there followed a period of promiscuity which ended when he met @entity115 , a stunning brunette whose big break came in the sitcom @entity246			1
bad influence ? : @entity3 has developed a friendship with @entity62 musician @entity60 , a self - confessed drug user in real life , @entity3 played her househusband - walking the dog and keeping house			0
she said in interviews that he cooked for her every night			0
there were a couple of forays into the public eye			0
in 2000 , @entity3 took on a role in a @entity261 play called @entity262 , and while he was in the @entity263 he wrote a memoir , @entity265 , which came out in 2006			0
part biography , part meditation on fame , it was a curious book which he had wanted to present without putting his name on it			0
he explained that he felt as if the world owned ‘ @entity3 ’ and he did n’t want anything to do with that character			0
in 2003 he was in the indie film @entity276 , playing a drug user			0
the following year , in a case of life imitating art , he was arrested in @entity280 for marijuana possession			1
he also had prescription drugs on him			1
he was fined and given three one - year suspended prison terms			1
if that was not bad enough , four years ago his sister @entity286 was killed in a car accident - a tragedy which his brother @entity290 said they had all struggled to cope with			0
she left a nightclub in @entity293 and was struck by a car , dying in hospital the following day			0
her death did n’t bring the family together			0
@entity3 remains unreconciled to both parents			0
for the past three years , he has lived in a large apartment in the trendy @entity301 area of @entity5			0
he has the entire eighth floor			0
one neighbour is a supermarket magnate			0
a close friend of @entity3 ’s pal @entity60 says that the former child actor is not a recluse , just someone who values his privacy			0
as @entity3 once said : ‘ i had all the fame anyone could want , and i ran away from it			0
’ but the question now is whether running away is doing him even more damage than the fame that he grew to loathe .			0

sources say he has been ' hooked for a year and a half '
' driven to drugs ' after split from @entity115
