by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 27 february 2013 it may look like a rusty wreck , but this ultra-rare @entity3 will still set you back a pretty penny - and will cost a further £ 250,000 to restore to its former glory			2
for the 1949 @entity7 was just the fourth car built by the iconic @entity10 car company after it was bought by @entity11			1
the much - coveted car , which retrospectively became known as the @entity13 , is one of just 15 ever made and nine still in existence			1
in need of @entity17 : this @entity7 is on the market for almost £ 100,000 but will cost a further £ 250,000 to restore to its former glory in demand : the car was one of just 15 made and one of eight or nine still in existence , so it is highly desirable despite its poor condition pricey : a db1 in mint condition , like the one pictured , can sell for in excess of £ 400,000 but it is in need of some tender loving care from a car enthusiast with plenty of spare cash to spend after three decades of decay			1
specialist dealer @entity37 has the motor on the market for £ 99,950 in the hope that someone will snap it up with the intention of restoring it			2
whoever takes on the project could end up making a tidy profit in the end however , with mint condition @entity48 usually shifting for more than £ 400,000 , with prices of classic @entity51 rising in the current market			1
@entity53 , general manager for @entity54 - based @entity37 , said : ' the chassis is good and it is a complete car but it is need of a serious restoration			0
' the body looks quite bad but we do n't think it will need to be replaced and it still has its original chassis and engine which is important			0
' any rare @entity3 such as this model is desirable and values are really going up at the moment			0
' about 90 per cent of all @entity51 ever built still exist but we think there are just eight or nine of the 15 two - litres left and only two others we know about in the @entity10			0
rare : the @entity3 has been bought by a specialist dealer from its previous owner in @entity71 where it was left decaying in a garage for three decades new era : the car was just the fourth made after @entity11 bought the iconic motor company in 1947 iconic : the car later became known as the @entity13 with @entity11 's @entity77 continuing to live on in the current @entity3 range , with the firm currently building the @entity80 ' the past ten years has seen some prices appreciate by more than 600 per cent			1
the @entity3 is a really pretty car and it will look fantastic when restored			2
it was one of just 15 @entity48 ever made , but what will you get for your £ 100,000 : ' the car will probably cost around £ 250,000 to restore and take between a year and 18 months			1
' @entity11 took over the @entity3 in 1947 with the two - litre sports model the first car built under his management			1
it later became known as the @entity13 with @entity11 's @entity77 continuing to live on in the current @entity3 range , with the firm currently building the db9			1
as the original name suggests , the car is powered by a 2 - litre engine which developed a modest 90bhp when it was new - giving the @entity97 a top speed of a mere 93mph			0
this is less than half the top speed a current @entity3 is capable of but its impressive 24mpg makes it greener than all of the current range barring the @entity106 - based @entity105			0
the car 's brochure states : ' the discriminating motorist will find every virtue he is likely to look for - beauty of styling , superb comfort , speed with safety and power to spare			0
' it adds : ' you will certainly be proud to own one ; you could even be excused for boasting about it			0
' @entity11 is understood to have opted against larger scale production of the car because he was underwhelmed by its performance , focusing the firm 's resources onto the more powerful @entity126			2
this particular model was the fourth ' @entity13 ' to leave the firm 's factory in @entity130 , @entity131 and was delivered to @entity132 in 1949 in its original livery of @entity134 with @entity135			2
the car was then chosen to represent @entity3 at the @entity137 of that year where it was sold to another dealer , @entity138			0
original : the body looks quite bad but dealers do n't think it will need to be replaced and it still has its original chassis and engine underwhelming : @entity11 is understood to have opted against larger scale production of the car because he was underwhelmed by its performance a ' continuation ' log book from 1963 shows it was moved to @entity71 that year where it remained until @entity37 recently bought it			1
for the past 41 years it has had just one owner and has been kept off the road since 1983			0
@entity37 is calling the classic sports car one of the world 's most exciting @entity3 restoration projects			0
mr @entity53 added : ' the @entity13 was the last @entity3 to have a four - cylinder engine with @entity11 fitting the @entity126 with a more powerful six - cylinder			1
' it was capable of nearly 100mph when it was new so it was quite respectable at the time but this was n't fast enough for @entity11			2

the @entity7 was one of just 15 made
it was the first model made after @entity11 bought the company
the car became known retrospectively as the @entity13
a fully restored @entity13 can sell for in excess of £ 400,000
