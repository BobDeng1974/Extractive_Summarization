a portrait of string instrument crafter @entity2			2
it has been claimed his highly sought after violins were developed by accident their more powerful and fuller sound has seen them acknowledged as the best violins ever crafted			1
but those created by @entity2 would only go on to become the world ’s most expensive musical instruments as a result of errors in their creation , it is claimed			1
an analysis of hundreds of instruments made in his legendary workshop has identified the key design features that give them more power and a fuller sound			1
acoustic experts found that vital to the sound is the shape and length of the violin ’s f - shaped holes through which air escapes			1
the more elongated these are , the more noise the instrument can produce			1
the thickness of a violin ’s back plate also contributes to its acoustic power			2
but a model created from the measurements of technical drawings of @entity42 - era violins from museums , collector databases and books , as well as x-ray and cat scans of the instruments , suggests the alterations to the traditional holes were unintentional – they most likely came about by craftsmanship error as they tried to replicate an original blueprint			1
the researchers found the 17th and 18th century ‘ golden age ’ violins crafted by @entity2 and the other @entity42 masters @entity57 and @entity58 slowly evolved to more elongated f - holes and thicker back plates , rather than an obvious shift in design			1
professor @entity64 , of the @entity65 , in @entity66 , said : ‘ we found if you try to replicate a sound hole exactly from the last one you made , you will always have a little error			1
‘ you are cutting with a knife into thin wood and you can not get it perfectly , and the error we report is about 2 per cent … always within what would have happened if it was an evolutionary change , accidentally from random fluctuations			2
’ in 2011 a @entity76 sold at auction for almost £ 10million			2
while each violin maker undoubtedly possessed a good ear , whether they recognised the particular design elements that contribute to a more powerful sound is still up for debate			0
professor @entity64 said : ‘ people had to be listening , and had to be picking things that were more efficient , and were making good selection of what instrument to replicate			0
‘ whether they understood , ‘ oh , we need to make the sound hole more slender , ’ we can not say			0
but they definitely knew what was a better instrument to replicate			0
’ stradivarius violins , such as the two pictured , are considered to be the greatest violins ever crafted and can sell for millions the study published in the @entity97 took seven years and involved examining the acoustic dynamics of stringed instruments from the oud , lute , and medieval fiddles to the guitar and ultimately the violin , a period spanning 800 years			2
during this time sound - hole shape evolved from a simple round shape to a semicircle , which eventually morphed into a c - shape that grew more elongated , ultimately assuming the f - shape of the violin			1
the perimeter of these shapes steadily grew , while the area of the interior void gradually decreased			0
the results may be useful for master violin makers looking to design more powerful , fuller - sounding instruments , although professor @entity64 acknowledges there is more to producing a quality violin than adjusting a few parameters			0
he added : ‘ mystery is good , and there is magic in violin making			0
some makers , i do not know how they do it , it is an art form			0
they have their techniques and methods			0
but here , for us , it is good to understand scientifically as much as you can			0

the perfections of @entity76 violins were created by error , it is claimed
acoustic experts say shape and length of holes is key to their sound
the more elongated these are , the more noise the instrument can produce
but analysis of technical drawings suggests this came about by accident
' golden age ' violins of the 17th and 18th century slowly evolved over time
