@entity11 and @entity12 were fishing for barramundi at @entity15 beach when mr @entity12 spotted the huge crocodile 's head breaking the surface about five metres off shore			1
the beast then vanished beneath the waves			2
@entity11 and @entity12 were fishing when they spotted the crocodile in what would prove a terrifyingly close call , ms @entity11 had turned to get more bait when the crocodile burst out of the water just a metre away from her			1
' five minutes before it appeared i was standing knee - deep in the water casting my line out , ' mr @entity12 told @entity33			2
' it came right out of the water onto the beach			2
that ’s when i said to the missus " do n’t panic , but there 's a crocodile next to you "			2
' i grabbed a stick and whacked the sand in front of its head and he kind of went back in			0
but he was stalking us			0
i ’d say he was in the water for quite a while stalking us before we actually saw him			0
' i ’ve seen crocs a lot , but not like that			0
it really put the wind up us			0
' ms @entity11 dropped her rod and the pair fled to their car			1
they watched the crocodile for another 30 minutes before it eventually moved off to a nearby creek			1
it disappeared beneath the water before launching itself onto the sand next to the couple ms @entity11 says she was part - excited , part - terrified by her close encounter			1
' it was a pretty hairy experience , ' she said			0
' @entity12 stayed cool , calm and collected and pretty much took it all in his stride			0
