@entity1 's city attorney issued a cease - and - desist demand to a mobile app which allows drivers who are fed up having to circle around trying find a parking space to purchase a spot from someone who is already parked in one			1
in a letter to @entity11 , city attorney @entity9 cited a provision in @entity1 's police code that prohibits people and companies from buying , selling or leasing public on - street parking and mandates fees of up to $ 300 for drivers who violate the law			1
@entity9 's warning to @entity21 is the latest attempt by city government officials and state lawmakers nationwide trying to figure out how to regulate web - based businesses that offer shared parking , transportation and housing services using mobile applications			2
a new app for @entity1 drivers called ' @entity21 ' lets them buy a parking spot from another motorist already in a space among the more popular ridesharing services are @entity36 and @entity37 , and popular housing apps include @entity39			1
the @entity21 app allows drivers to get an often elusive parking spot and sell it for $ 5 , $ 10 , even $ 20 , and then wait until the buyer arrives to take their place			2
@entity9 has given its creators until july 11 to shut down operations in @entity1 or possibly face a lawsuit under @entity49 's @entity48			0
@entity9 added that besides the violations , @entity21 's app encourages drivers to unsafely use their mobile devices and engage in online parking bidding wars while behind the wheel			2
@entity55 said in an email monday that he is talking with his legal staff and did n't immediately have a specific comment about the letter			0
in a letter to @entity11 , city attorney @entity9 cited a provision in @entity1 's police code that prohibits people and companies from buying , selling or leasing public on - street parking and mandates fees of up to $ 300 for drivers who violate the law ' as a general principle , we believe that a new company providing value to people should be regulated and not banned , ' @entity55 wrote			1
' this applies also to companies like @entity39 , @entity36 and @entity37 that are continuously facing difficulties while delivering something that makes users happy			0
regulation is fundamental in driving innovation , while banning is just stopping it			0
' the city attorney 's warning to @entity21 comes about a month after his office started investigating the startup , which began its @entity1 operations in april			1
' technology has given rise to many laudable innovations in how we live and work â€” and @entity21 is not one of them			0
it 's illegal , it puts drivers on the hook for $ 300 fines , and it creates a predatory private market for public parking spaces that @entity99 will not tolerate , ' @entity9 said in a written statement			2
' people are free to rent out their own private driveways and garage spaces should they choose to do so			0
but we will not abide businesses that hold hostage on - street public parking spots for their own private profit			2
' parking in @entity1 has long been known as a driver 's worst nightmare			2
a recent @entity113 parking census reported that the city has 440,000 parking spots available - but only 275,000 of those are street parking			0
@entity9 has given its creators until july 11 to shut down operations in @entity1 or possibly face a lawsuit under @entity49 's @entity48 the @entity21 app allows drivers to get an often elusive parking spot and sell it for $ 5 , $ 10 , even $ 20 , and then wait until the buyer arrives to take their place @entity9 's letter to @entity21 also asked @entity128 to immediately remove @entity129 from its app store			1
@entity128 did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment			0
@entity1 - based technology expert @entity133 , who runs the @entity134 , whose objective is to connect the startup community with policymakers and government , believes the issue between @entity140 and the city attorney is a great example of the need to create more forums for the two entities to engage			1
' companies need to be familiar with local laws , but threatened legal actions , such as cease - and - desist letters , only divert attention away from the opportunity to rethink how the community can use technology to improve government services , ' said @entity155 , who 's a former executive director the @entity156 at the @entity157 , @entity158			1
two other tech companies , @entity160 and @entity161 , which @entity9 said also violates city and state laws , will receive similar cease - and - desist warnings later this week			1
@entity166 co-founder @entity165 , whose $ 5 - per - parking - spot swapping app was also warned to cease and desist , said monday the goal is just to reduce congestion , which creates pollution and other problems			1
' we do n't understand why they want to shut us down			0
we are trying to solve the huge parking problem , which is not only bad for drivers but for all the city , ' he said			0
