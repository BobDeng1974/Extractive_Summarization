an archive of highly - classified test reports has come to light revealing how the @entity3 killed thousands of @entity5 citizens by bombing their own cities with @entity8 rockets - for target practice			1
the top - secret @entity11 documents , much of which are written in coded @entity5 , are said to offer proof @entity13 used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles			1
the incredible 20 - page archive is made up of reports which were only issued to ' @entity22 ' , a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it			1
an archive of highly - classified test reports has come to light revealing how the @entity3 killed thousands of @entity5 citizens by bombing their own cities with v - 2 rockets - for target practice the top - secret @entity11 documents , much of which are written in coded @entity5 , are said to offer proof @entity13 used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles the burn marks are said to be proof of the documents ' sensitivity , as someone clearly tried to torch them the incredible archive is made up of reports which were only issued to ' @entity22 ' , a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it deadly : a v - 2 rocket launched in @entity5 from a fixed site in the summer of 1943 they show how the desperate @entity3 used their own settlements as targets while developing the deadly weapons during @entity51			1
it means thousands of @entity5 died at the hands of their own leader in 1944 and 1945 - who then blamed the carnage on @entity58			1
the @entity8 rockets - the @entity8 standing for @entity60 , or @entity60 - were fired at @entity61 and the south east of @entity63 , as well as targets on mainland @entity65 , killing over 7,000 people			1
the warheads were launched in the final months of the war as @entity69 advanced closer to victory and were considered @entity13 's last role of the dice			1
however , it is widely agreed that if the @entity3 has developed the rockets sooner they may have won the race to develop the atomic bomb and gone on to win the war			1
the @entity8 rockets - the @entity8 standing for @entity60 , or @entity60 - were fired at @entity61 and the south east of @entity63 , as well as targets on mainland @entity65 , killing over 7,000 people the documents show that @entity13 fired @entity8 rockets from a test centre in what was then @entity82 into surrounding cities , killing his own people @entity86 reconnaissance photograph of @entity8 rockets at a test stand the remarkable archive was rescued from the flames at the end of the conflict and has remained in the possession of a @entity5 collector ever since			1
now it is set to go under the hammer at @entity96 , in @entity61 , on march 18 , where it is expected to fetch Â£ 2,500			0
on wednesday , @entity96 spokesman @entity99 said : ' the @entity8 was the first truly ballistic missile which might have brought victory to @entity13 had he won the race to develop the atomic bomb in 1945			1
' a note which comes with the archive from a researcher indicates that these were final test firing reports for the rockets and were issued in very limited numbers of no more than 10 to 12 copies			2
' the present archive could prove to be a highly important new source of information on what was by far the most important technological and scientific development to have come from the @entity51			0
' the @entity8 was the first real ballistic missile			0
powerful : the first v - 2 attack on @entity69 hit @entity120 in @entity61 in september 1944 and left a gigantic crater ' had @entity13 been successful in developing the technology of the atomic bomb then he would have had the capability of firing it long distances			2
' with the use of this rocket - unquestionably this would have led to the @entity3 winning the war			2
' the document , which is typed on sheets of @entity8 paper , shows a large number of @entity8 rockets were fired from the @entity137 region where experimental devices were tested			1
they were fired against the @entity139 with missiles claiming thousands of lives in @entity61 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
but shockingly , the reports also reveal many of the original test firings were at @entity5 towns and cities - mainly in the area of @entity82			2
it is believed special units were then sent to evaluate the extent of the damage caused and report back to the @entity153 about their effectiveness			0
mr @entity156 added : ' perhaps the most remarkable fact which comes from these papers is that many of these test firings were fired at @entity5 targets			0
devastation : a v - 2 rocket attack left this block of flats in @entity166 , @entity61 , in ruins ' this is evidence enough of how desperate the @entity3 were becoming after @entity169 and the relentless advances of allied forces across @entity65			2
' many of these test firings at @entity5 towns and cities resulted in considerable casualties and substantial damages to houses and other properties			0
' i have never seen such concrete evidence to substantiate that @entity13 actually used his own towns and cities as target practice			0
' after the war the majority of @entity8 - related documents were destroyed by the @entity5 before the @entity139 moved in by orders of the @entity11 mr @entity99 said : ' the fact that several of the sheets in the present archive have clearly been in a fire suggests that these very papers were rescued from such destruction			1
' this really is an exceptionally rare find and one that offers a chilling insight into @entity13 's war efforts during his final months			2
' the v - 2 rocket was developed by @entity199 , a @entity5 aerospace engineer and space architect			0
he was a member of the @entity201 but after the war went to work in @entity203 for @entity204 and eventually helped develop the technology that put man on the moon in 1969			0
the @entity8 was the most advanced weapon used in the war until the @entity203 dropped atomic bombs on @entity210 in august 1945			0
launched from mobile units , the 46ft ( 14m ) tall rockets were powered by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 13 tonnes , fully fuelled			0
the v - 2s were also @entity13 's answer to his country 's disappointment that the @entity220 ( or doodlebugs ) did n't knock @entity69 out of the war			2
they were launched vertically and could travel at 3,335mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away , making it the world 's first long - range combat - ballistic missile .			0

most of the top - secret documents are written in coded @entity5
they were issued to the mysterious ' @entity22 ' unit
they show how the desperate @entity3 used their own settlements as targets
it means thousands of @entity5 died at the hands of their own leader
@entity8 rockets were a final throw of the dice at the end of the war for @entity13
