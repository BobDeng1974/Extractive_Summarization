@entity10 photographer @entity9 dresses the dogs in pieces designed by pet couturier @entity13 , before taking their pictures for her new photographic series , @entity18			1
each photograph carefully captures the pooches pulling high - fashion poses and unique facial expressions as well as giving them the chance to show off their stylish new look			1
@entity28 dog : all of @entity9 's chihuahua models wear outfits created by dog couturier , @entity13 ' after discovering the incredible @entity34 scene in @entity35 , i wanted to create a series that would resemble what you see in human fashion magazines , ' @entity9 tells @entity40			1
' i organised a casting of chihuahuas , because i thought they would be the most expressive for this project , with their larger than life attitude			0
also , they are so tiny and their features are so small , they show the fashion very well ( i guess the petite size runs within dog fashion as well ! )			0
' i invited @entity13 , a famous pet couturier , to design pieces for me			1
on each shoot , he would bring his creations , all very detailed and exquisite , and i would go through them , pairing them with each other and with matching backgrounds , styling every photo like a stylist would do on a @entity18 shoot ( i assume ! )			1
' ' the experience was thrilling in itself , to create something new from and with someone else 's art , and then the photography part was also very exciting			0
i tried and capture the dogs ' expressions that would match the outfits they were wearing , to create a whimsical gallery of characters			2
' my entire photography work is about pets and our relationship to them			0
i am fascinated by the human / dog bond in particular , and all the things that we subject dogs to , especially in a big city like @entity35			2
dogs have become more than animals , they are true life companion and often replace spouse and children ( it is very true in the world of dog fashion )			2
i am interested in challenging this bond , and what it says about us as a society			0
' why are humans turning to animals to replace relationships they ca n't form in the human world ? why are dogs accepting anything from us ? what is this bond made of ? love ? co-dependance ? all these questions fuel my work			2
' unique : each photo aims to capture the dogs pulling high fashion poses and unusual facial expressions resemblance : some of the diva dogs look a little like members of the royal family as well as @entity115 starlets ' as for dog fashion , it is quite a fascinating world as well , ' adds @entity9			1
' i discovered it a few years ago			0
these people gather in charity events , dress their dogs with custom made outfits that costs hundreds of dollars			2
designers compete for best designs , dogs compete for best model , etc. as in child pageant though , even though the focus seems to be on the dog , the show is really all about the ' pawrents ' ( the owners of the doggies ) , and there is a lot of drama and fun behind the scene ! ' ' models ' appearing in the series include @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			1
according to @entity9 , her pet portraits go beyond capturing the interesting features of dogs and reveals that she looks for ' soul , personality [ and ] charisma ' in her models			1
writing on her website , she adds : ' every dog is an individual			0
in my mind , each one harbours a rich inner world of stories and dreams			0
' as a photographer , i aspire to create a window into that world and let that richness emerge			2
' over the last three years , @entity9 , who also creates reportage photos that go behind the scenes at veterinary clinics and rescue homes , has focused her projects on pets and their place in society			1
and she 's enjoyed plenty of success			0
late last year her series @entity187 went viral online , and she is now working on her first book			0
elaborate : outfits are bejeweled , furred and embellished in a process that takes months to complete dog lover : outfits are created with pooches who have ' proms and awards shows to attend ' in mind help : @entity9 also does reportage work and has created photos behind the scenes at dog rescue homes doing well : last year , a project of @entity9 's entitled @entity187 went viral online inspiration : @entity13 's creations are strictly couture and inspired by everything from movies to fairy tales			1
