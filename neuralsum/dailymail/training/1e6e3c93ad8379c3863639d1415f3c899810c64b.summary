it has the low ability to cause disease in healthy individuals but has been known to cause severe illness in people with pre-existing conditions			0
its transmission can occur through bites , licks or even close proximity to animals			0

‘ her blood was full of bacteria and organisms			0
‘ @entity52 , an organism present in dog saliva , normally does n't cause damage			1

but it is extremely rare			0
’ dr @entity105 added that a ' very small ' cut had been found on her hand			0
she was rushed to @entity10 but died the next night after her organs began shutting down he added that he would have expected that the penicillin she regularly took would have protected her from the bacteria entering her bloodstream and was unsure why it had not			1
