marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart , eyes , blood vessels and skeleton			2
it 's caused by a defect in the gene that usually allows the body to produce a protein that helps give connective tissue its elasticity and strength			1
people with the syndrome are usually tall and thin , with disproportionally long arms , legs , fingers and toes , and may have a curved spine , flat feet or nearsightedness			0
treatment usually includes medications to keep blood pressure low to reduce the strain on weakened blood vessels			0
depending on the severity of symptoms and the part of the body that 's affected , surgery may be necessary			2
if the heart or blood vessels , such as the aorta in the heart , are affected , the condition can become life - threatening			2
about 1 in 5,000 people have marfan syndrome , and it affects men and women of all races and ethnic groups equally			2
