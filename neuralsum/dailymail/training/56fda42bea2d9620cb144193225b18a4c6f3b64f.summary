by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 7 april 2013 holidaymakers were shocked to see a monster rise from the deep - a giant anchor which has been buried under sands for hundreds of years			1
visitors to the @entity7 beach saw the 12ft high anchor , which is estimated to be 170 years old , rise up out of the sands overnight , after a strong tide moved the shifting sands			1
the one tonne anchor was recovered from @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , and tests will now be carried out it to discover where it came from			1
the massive anchor was uncovered by the shifting sands in @entity21 , @entity22 after remaining buried for 170 years visitors to the beach were stunned to find the 12ft anchor had been uncovered by the tide in a matter of hours a tractor was required to lift the massive anchor , which weighed in at one tonne , from the sand and transport it for testing			1
the anchor , while a significant piece of maritime history , is by no means the first large piece of debris to have been discovered at @entity13			2
the beach is known as @entity7 ' equivalent of @entity38 's @entity37 as over 300 ships have been wrecked at the picturesque beauty spot in the past			1

' over time stormy weather and the shifting of vast tonnages of sand , the beach has given up scores of wrecks and jetsam and flotsam artifacts - including many anchors			2
a tractor was required to lift the massive anchor , which weighed in at one tonne , from the sand and transport it for testing ' @entity61 only started to be recorded in some detail when newspapers started to record in the first decade of the 19th century the misfortune of hapless mariners			2
' little if anything is known about the names of more than 300 vessels thought to have floundered there			0
' the beach , part of the @entity73 leisure and nature complex , is often the resting place of the washed up skeletons of steel and wood vessels			0
the mysterious debris is washed in on spring tides which often send the sea two miles up the shore			0
@entity83 in @entity14 , is known as @entity7 ' equivalent of @entity38 's @entity37 as over 300 ships have been wrecked there as the sands levels rise and fall artifacts can be shifted or buried deeper , and many remain undiscovered for years			1
nature reserve rangers make daily sweeps of the beach to check for washed up items			2
senior ranger @entity93 said : ' finds have varied from lost cargoes of sun tan oil to coconut trees with coconuts that are washed up on the tide			0
' but it is what is revealed from under the sand or storm ripped dunes that is of more interest			0
