a flying saucer took to the skies over @entity2 on saturday as @entity3 tested a new vehicle that could one day be used to transport people to @entity6			1
the test drive of the @entity8 , which was carried 120,000ft ( 23 miles ) into the sky by a helium balloon , was considered a success despite the parachute not fully working			1
cheers in the control room as the vehicle launched from the island of @entity17 quickly died down however , when it became clear that the new inflatable braking system had failed to property unfurl			0
the low - density supersonic decelerator could one day be used to take astronauts to @entity6 , and is shown here before the test the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) is a large , doughnut - shaped first deceleration technology that deployed during the flight			1
the second is an enormous parachute ( the @entity38 )			0
imagery downlinked in real - time from the test vehicle indicates that the parachute did not deploy as expected , and the team is still analyzing data on the parachute so that lessons learned can be applied for the next test flights , scheduled for early next year			0
' we are thrilled about the test , ' said @entity47 , project manager for @entity8 at @entity3 's @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50			2
' the test vehicle worked beautifully , and we met all of our flight objectives			0
' we have recovered all the vehicle hardware and data recorders and will be able to apply all of the lessons learned from this information to our future flights			0
' @entity3 officials were still pleased with the flight for the $ 150 million experiment , and said it was a pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to @entity6			1
the space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the same parachute design in use since the twin @entity71 spacecraft landed on the red planet in 1976			1
saturday 's launch over @entity2 was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no - fly zones			1
technology needs to advance , or else humanity wo n't be able to fly beyond the @entity80 in low - @entity82 orbit , according to @entity83 , head of space technology , at @entity3 headquarters			2
' technology development ' is the surest path to @entity6 , ' @entity83 said at a june briefing			2
viewers around the world followed portions of the mission in real time over the internet thanks to cameras on board the vehicle that beamed back low - resolution footage as it ascended over the @entity100 island of @entity17			0
after taking off at 11.40am from the @entity24 , the balloon boosted the disc - shaped vehicle over the @entity27			0
its rocket motor ignited , carrying the vehicle at supersonic speeds to an altitude of 34 miles above the surface			1
the environment this high up is similar to the thin @entity6 atmosphere , where @entity3 still uses 1970s technology to bring rovers and other devices onto the @entity6 surface			1
the test vehicle hardware , black box data recorder and parachute were all recovered later in the day after the craft was dragged aboard a @entity3 ship a graphic shows the proposed flight path and touch down for the flying saucer mission ' we want to test them here where it 's cheaper before we send it to @entity6 to make sure that it 's going to work there , ' project manager @entity47 of the @entity48 said during a pre-launch news conference in @entity17 in early june			1
when it prepared to drop back the @entity82 , a tube around the vehicle was supposed to have expanded like a @entity100 puffer fish , creating atmospheric drag to dramatically slow it down from @entity139 , or four times the speed of sound			2
the parachute , which on this occasion failed to fully unfurl , is used to guide the vehicle to a safe ocean splashdown			0
at 110ft in diameter , the parachute is twice as big as the one that carried the 1 - ton curiosity rover through the @entity6 atmosphere in 2011			1
engineers planned to analyze the data and conduct several more flights next year before deciding whether to fly the vehicle and parachute on a future @entity6 mission			2
in flight : the saucer - shaped vehicle hovering saturday over @entity17 , @entity2 , during an experimental flight high in @entity82 's atmosphere saturday 's test : this image shows the launch of the high - altitude balloon carrying a saucer - shaped vehicle for @entity3 the vehicle splashed down in the ocean at approximately 11:35 a.m. @entity167 ( 2:35 p.m. pdt / 5:35 p.m. edt ) , after the engineering test flight concluded			1
the test vehicle hardware , black box data recorder and parachute were all recovered later in the day			0
in order to get larger payloads to @entity6 , and to pave the way for future human explorers , cutting - edge technologies like @entity8 are critical			1
among other applications , this new space technology will enable delivery of the supplies and materials needed for long - duration missions to the @entity6			2
' this entire effort was just fantastic work by the whole team and is a proud moment for @entity3 's @entity184 , " said @entity183 , deputy associate administrator for the @entity184 at @entity185 in @entity186			0
' this flight reminds us why @entity3 takes on hard technical problems , and why we test - to learn and build the tools we will need for the future of space exploration			0
' technology drives exploration , and yesterday 's flight is a perfect example of the type of technologies we are developing to explore our solar system			0

the saturday launch over @entity2 took the spacecraft 23 miles above the surface and into the @entity82 's atmosphere
conditions at that altitude are similar to those on @entity6
the saucer could one day transport humans and heavier payloads to the ' @entity6 '
