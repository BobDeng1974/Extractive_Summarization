by @entity0 published : 05:18 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 22 october 2013 from a @entity5 still life to evocative @entity4 landscapes , there are few paintings that artist @entity7 can not copy			1
so similar to the originals are her works , even art experts have trouble telling the difference			1
and while it might sound like an odd choice of career , according to @entity7 , demand for copies is soaring - not least from museums who use them when the original work is being cleaned or restored			1
copy : @entity7 's replica of this painting by @entity24 is almost identical to the original ( below ) @entity24 's original : the real @entity26 of @entity27 ( 1880 ) hangs in the @entity28 in @entity29 ' i have been reproducing great master works to a very high standard throughout my career , and as a result it is quite difficult for the untrained eye to tell the difference , ' explains @entity7			1
' even experts have missed the fact that my painting was the copied version			2
my paintings have hung in galleries when the real painting was on loan , and people were none the wiser			0
' so what makes a good copy ? @entity7 , whose paintings sell for between £ 600 and £ 9,000 depending on the complexity of the work , says it 's all about getting the style , technique and ageing spot on			1
' each painting is thoroughly researched , ' she reveals			0
' the correct size canvas has to be selected and primed , aged and executed in oil paint to ensure not only the look , but also the texture and feel of the painting , is as close to the original as possible			0
' the best copyist paintings are ones that have the same texture , colour and age as the original			2
popular : @entity5 's @entity69 and @entity70 is in a private collection but @entity7 was still able to copy it detailed : @entity7 's version of this @entity5 still life faithfully recreates the @entity77 painter 's impressionist style spot the difference : @entity7 's version of @entity81 's @entity80 in a @entity82 ( left ) and the original ( right ) many of @entity7 's works are copies of @entity87 paintings - a genre that has proved popular with clients			1
the 19th century art movement originated in @entity91 during the 1870s and 1880s , in the face of opposition from the conventional art community who objected to the lack of sharp lines and contours , and artistic detail			0
instead , @entity87 works focus on recording a moment and are characterised by thin , visible brush strokes			2
among the most famous of the @entity87 are @entity4 , @entity24 , @entity5 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
' as a copyist , it is important i do not have a style of my own , as each painting must look like it is by the [ original ] artist			2
' despite the illegal - sounding nature of her business , @entity7 says everything is entirely above board and that clients know exactly what they 're buying when they purchase one of her copies			1
' everything i do is completely within copyright law , and i would never pass off one of my paintings as the real deal , ' she explains			0
' i adhere strictly to copyright laws which permit copying 70 years after the original artist has died , and more contemporary artists continue to come into circulation			0
this is why my work tends to focus on the great masters			0
' it is up to the purchaser what they tell their friends [ about ] the painting			0
if they pass it off as the real deal then it is up to them and out of my control			0
' copyright concerns notwithstanding , @entity7 admits that the toughest part of recreating great art is accommodating idiosyncratic techniques			1
' it is often the simplest looking paintings that are the hardest to copy , as the dips and the quick brush strokes are harder to copy than the great masters , ' she explains , adding that each work takes around three months to complete			2
the artist at work : @entity7 at home in the @entity155 studio where she creates her copies of famous paintings favourite : copies of @entity4 's paintings , including this one , are especially popular with clients identical : @entity4 's @entity161 on @entity162 is among @entity7 's portfolio of copies ' for example			1
@entity167 ’s pen and ink sketches are very hard to copy due to the spontaneous approach of the drawing			0
' so would she ever attempt an original work of her own ? surprisingly , @entity7 says she would never even consider it			2
' no , ' she says			0
' i 'm not a fine artist , and do n't have a style of my own			0
having said that , i do enjoy doing illustration and water colour from time to time and i also enjoy photography			0
' it would seem there 's no end to @entity7 's artistic talents			1
recreation : the original rocks at @entity187 , @entity188 by @entity4 ( left ) and @entity7 's version ( right ) recreation : @entity7 's take on @entity24 ’s 1882 still life , two roses on a @entity193 original : @entity24 ’s stunning 1882 still life painting two roses on a @entity193			1

the painter she 's most often asked to copy is @entity77 impressionist @entity4
copies can take three months to make and cost between £ 600 and £ 9,000
