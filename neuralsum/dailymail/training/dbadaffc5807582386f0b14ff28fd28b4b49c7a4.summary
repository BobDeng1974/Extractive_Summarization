@entity0 had to endure a barrage of abuse from his own supporters as he headed down the tunnel at the end of what may prove to be his last game as head coach of @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s seventh defeat in nine @entity13 games was inflicted by two second - half goals from @entity16 striker @entity15			1
both were deflected , which perhaps sums up the @entity20 ’s luck at present , and time will tell if chairman @entity23 ’s notoriously itchy trigger finger holds off long enough for him to stay in charge for the trip to @entity26 on @entity27			2
afterwards , @entity0 insisted that he is still capable of turning the club ’s fortunes around but admitted that the decision is out of his hands			2

‘ i think the players believe we all are as well , but obviously other people will make decisions as far as that ’s concerned			0
i ’m not in control of that			0
‘ i want to carry on , i want to still do this job and see it turning around			0
that ’s not going to change			0
we ’re all in this together			0
‘ it ’s not really about me , i ’m more concerned about the players and the team			0

’ nearly 3,000 @entity9 fans made the trip to the @entity40 for this @entity122 derby and stayed largely supportive of @entity11 until the 63rd minute when he replaced @entity124 and @entity69 with @entity76 and @entity70			1
@entity0 later defended the decision by pointing out that both @entity124 and @entity69 have been carrying injuries , but it was met with a chorus of ‘ you don ’ t know what you ’re doing ’			2
when @entity15 claimed a fortuitous second goal for @entity16 three minutes later , the travelling fans were in open revolt			1
they hurled abuse at @entity11 as he walked past them en route to the dressing - rooms at the end			2
‘ i do n’t know if they would have wanted me to acknowledge them , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ what do you do in those circumstances ? ‘ i can understand			0
people are frustrated , i ’m frustrated , and so are the players			0
i can understand them expressing that , it ’s the nature of the job			0
former @entity148 and @entity149 defender @entity67 looks dejected after @entity15 scores his second goal @entity16 's in - form forward @entity41 passes the ball while being tracked by @entity9 's @entity69 @entity152 , on loan at the @entity9 from @entity154 , tussles for the ball with former @entity158 striker @entity15 former @entity159 defender @entity51 protects the ball from @entity9 forward @entity161 during their @entity13 clash midfielders @entity54 and @entity74 battle for the ball during their match at the @entity40 ‘ if anyone is going to take it then i ’m the person			1
i ’m there to be shot at			0
i stand out there and take it			0
i ’m prepared to take the criticism			0
’ @entity9 had actually played the neater football for a much of a first half short on clear - cut chances			1
but it was @entity16 who made the breakthrough six minutes after the restart with a goal that must have felt like a dagger to the heart for @entity11			1
@entity41 had possession in midfield and sprayed the ball wide to @entity52 who had made an overlapping run on the left			2
the @entity187 pulled it back to @entity15 who took @entity71 and @entity66 out of the game by switching the ball from his left foot to his right , and then beat @entity64 with a low shot that took a slight deflection off @entity67			1
@entity9 nearly equalised when @entity48 parried @entity74 ’s close - range effort and @entity66 scrambled the loose ball against the post			1
within seconds , the game – and possibly @entity11 ’s future – had been decided			0
@entity41 was involved , cutting inside from the left and laying a pass off for @entity43			0
the @entity204 tried his luck with a fierce effort from 25 yards and it took a bizarre double deflection off @entity15 before rolling inside the post with @entity64 helpless to keep it out			1
it secured @entity16 ’s first back - to - back wins in the league this season as @entity216 ’s side moved up to 11th place			1
aside from a hamstring problem that forced @entity41 off towards the end , the only blemish for @entity16 was that @entity15 will shortly be leaving on international duty with @entity222 at the @entity223			1
‘ we ’re going to miss him but hopefully they ’ll get knocked out pretty quickly and he wo n’t miss too many games , ’ joked @entity216			1
@entity0 , for one , will struggle to see the funny side			2
