by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 18:21 est , 20 july 2013 @entity1 was facing a new storm last night after attacking the thousands of @entity4 licence fee payers who complained over his abusive rant at @entity8 star @entity7			1
brand was forced to quit his @entity12 show in 2008 after @entity13 exposed obscene answer - machine messages which he and co-presenter @entity15 left for mr @entity7 , then 78.but in an interview with today 's @entity17 , the 38 - year - old actor says the incident - dubbed ' @entity18 ' - was a ' dishonest scandal '			1
he claims many of the 42,000 people who complained to the @entity4 either had no real idea of what they were complaining about or were motivated by an @entity26 agenda			1
brand said it was telling that the broadcast of the messages had attracted just two complaints - and that number only swelled in the light of what he said was hostile press coverage			2
@entity1 pictured with then - wife @entity37 , at the @entity38 claims many of the 42,000 people who complained to the @entity4 either had no real idea of what they were complaining about he says : ' there was obviously a pre-existing agenda in privately owned media to destabilise , attack and diminish the @entity4			1
' when @entity17 host @entity45 challenges him about whether viewers were motivated by the same agenda , he says : ' they were			2
' but attacking his remarks , @entity50 mp @entity49 , a member of the @entity51 , said : ' of course the people who complained at the time were genuinely offended by this man 's actions			2
the fact that he does n't seem to realise that shows that he has n't learnt anything			0
' the messages left by @entity1 and @entity15 concerned mr @entity7 ' granddaughter @entity18 , a burlesque dancer and @entity1 's former girlfriend			1
he tells ms @entity45 the fact the comedy veteran was booked as a future guest on the same show showed the incident in a different light			2
@entity1 says : ' the situation with the granddaughter had been talked about in a previous show			1
' i would always talk about things from my personal life on that radio show in a relatively respectful , cheeky way			0
the subsequent week @entity7 was booked to come on the show as a guest on the phone			1
how we broke the story of the messages left by @entity1 and @entity15 concerned mr @entity7 ' granddaughter ' i think what people imagined happened is that i went , " right , let 's leave a message for @entity7			1
" that is not what happened			0
what happened was he did n't answer the phone and so i said , " right , let 's leave a message			0
" ' @entity1 says he accepts it was ' really , really wrong ' to leave ' embarrassing and upsetting messages '			1
but he adds : ' it is offensive if someone calls up an answerphone , does some swearing and hangs up			0
but if , incrementally , that act is led to by a series of innuendo and jokes , it 's a different thing			0
it 's still a thing that is wrong but it is not the thing that they are offended by			0
' brand also says his desire to start a family is ' almost unseemly ' - but refuses to talk about his failed marriage to @entity37			0
last night @entity7 said : ' my thoughts are the same as they were			2
we kept silent at the time and i do n't want to have an opinion on it			0
if he wants to think it 's a dishonest scandal , then that 's up to him			1
' the show is broadcast on @entity121 at 11.15am today .			0

@entity1 , 38 , left obscene messages on @entity7 ' machine
