the @entity1 chairman of the @entity2 claimed wednesday that his @entity4 counterpart secretly colluded with the @entity5 to bring about the targeting of conservatives that has gripped politics - watchers for nearly a year			1
if true , it would mark the first involvement of an elected politician in a nearly year - long scandal that involved the @entity5 breaking the law and playing political favorites			2
@entity17 rep. @entity16 charged in a letter that @entity20 rep. @entity19 put a nonprofit tea party group called @entity23 the vote on the @entity5 's radar by asking the tax agency for information about the organization 's activities and its growing corps of volunteers			1
when the @entity5 later targeted the @entity22 - linked group and its founder , @entity33 , for years of special scrutiny – as it did with hundreds of other right - leaning groups that sought exemptions from federal income taxes – its letters employed language nearly identical to what @entity19 ' staff had written the @entity5			1
liberal groups , generally sailed through the application process quickly			0
the group also supports a national voter - id requirement , a deal - breaker among all but a handful of @entity4			0
@entity19 ' requests were disclosed in emails that @entity16 said came to the attention of @entity2 investigators only last week , following a @entity1 grilling of @entity5 commissioner @entity74			1
the @entity5 has only grudgingly provided documents that @entity16 's committee has demanded , and has stonewalled on thousands more pages that are the subject of subpoenas			0
' the @entity5 and the @entity80 said in a statement , referring to @entity19 , ' made numerous requests for virtually identical information from @entity23 the vote , raising concerns that the @entity5 improperly shared protected taxpayer information with @entity87 ’ staff			1
' other emails indicate that @entity90 , the former @entity5 official who now faces a likely contempt of @entity53 vote and possible criminal prosecution for allegedly violating the ' equal protection ' rights of conservatives , shared copies of @entity23 the vote 's tax returns with @entity19 ' office			1
the @entity20 @entity100 , said @entity16 , demanded that @entity23 the @entity50 send ' copies of all training materials used for volunteers , affiliates , or other entities			1
' tax headache : @entity90 risks being criminally prosecuted and held in @entity107 for her role in @entity5 abuses linked to anti-conservative bias five days later the @entity5 sent the @entity112 conservative group an email requesting ' a copy of yours volunteer registration form ... the process you use to assign volunteers ... how you keep your volunteers in teams , ' and ' how your volunteers are deployed ... following the training they receive by you			1
' @entity90 became personally involved with @entity19 ' requests in january 2013 when she asked @entity125 , an underling , ' did we find anything ? ' getting a negative response , @entity90 told @entity125 to ' check tomorrow please			2
' three days after that exchange , @entity19 received the tax return copies			2
he never shared them with republicans on the committee , something @entity16 says he had an obligation to do			0
a year later , the @entity100 denied during a committee hearing that he had worked with the @entity5 to target @entity23 the vote			2
' we want to get to the bottom of how these coincidences happened , ' the group 's attorney @entity139 testified in february , ' and we ’re going to try to figure out whether ... there was any staff of this committee that might have been involved in putting @entity23 the vote on the radar screen of some of these federal agencies			2
' @entity19 leapt up and asked for permission to interrupt			0
' what she just said , ' he insisted , ' is absolutely incorrect and not true			0
' he will likely clash again with @entity16 on thursday , when the @entity2 meets to consider a measure calling on the entire @entity2 to declare that @entity90 is in @entity107 for refusing to answer questions about the targeting scheme			2
in two hearings she has invoked her @entity159 right against self - incrimination ; republicans secured a party - line vote this year declaring that @entity90 waived that right by offering a self - serving opening statement before saying she was done talking			1
oversight sheriff : rep. @entity16 is demanding answers from his counterpart @entity19 , the ranking @entity100 on the @entity2 that @entity16 chairs @entity90 , who has refused to testify about her role in the @entity5 's political favoritism , is accused of taking her cues from @entity19 in a bid to hobble a tea party group that focuses on voting fairness in addition to written @entity5 demands from @entity90 and other @entity5 officials , @entity175 found herself hectored with sudden on - site visits from several other government agencies after her organization filed its application for so - called 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status , a designation that would allow it to operate tax - free while providing a benefit to the public			1
one by one the @entity188 ; the @entity189 ; the @entity190 ; and the @entity191 – an partner organization of the federal @entity193 – descended on her with written demands and licenses to inspect her property			0
@entity189 demanded to see her family 's firearms			0
the @entity200 administration has pledged that it would pursue its own aggressive investigation of the @entity5 's politically motivated activities			0
@entity203 , a trial attorney within the @entity5 's civil - rights enforcement division , has been appointed to lead that probe			0
conservatives point out that @entity203 may not be an impartial sleuth since she ' maxed out ' on her legal eligibility to donate to president @entity200 's successful political campaigns .			0

emails show @entity20 @entity4 rep. @entity19 asked the @entity5 for dirt on @entity50 , a tea party - linked group in @entity216 , @entity112
days later , the @entity5 began a series of *increasingly* demanding letters to the organization 's founder , using language nearly identical to @entity19 '
the group was one of hundreds whose applications for tax exemptions were delayed in a scheme to single out right - wingers for their *beliefs*
@entity90 , the former @entity5 official then in charge of *vetting* and *monitoring* tax - exempt nonprofit groups , was involved in responding to @entity19
at one point the @entity5 sent the @entity4 pol copies of @entity23 the vote 's confidential tax returns .
@entity90 has refused to testify about her part in the scandal , and the @entity2 will soon vote on a contempt of @entity53 *citation*
