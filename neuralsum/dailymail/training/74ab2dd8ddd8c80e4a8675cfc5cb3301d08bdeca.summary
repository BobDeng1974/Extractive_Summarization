by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 _ @entity3 - the former @entity4 manager under investigation by the @entity6 for ‘ racist , sexist and homophobic messages ’ - attended @entity8 ’s 20th anniversary dinner only three months ago			1
at a glittering event at @entity11 , @entity3 was one of 650 luminaries from the worlds of football , politics and business in attendance			1
it is understood that @entity3 was sat on a table with former @entity21 leader and @entity4 supporter @entity22			1
@entity28 said at the dinner : ‘ people must stand up against racism			1
we know what we should do , we know what we must do , but we just have to identify the will - when ability and will meet then results occur			0
’ @entity3 has often spoken positively of the anti-discrimination organisation			1
fan favourite : @entity3 was hugely popular in @entity42 , the fans were outraged when he was let go by @entity44 @entity46 's story that shook football in 2012 , he said : ‘ the chairman [ lord @entity55 ] of the ‘ @entity8 ’ campaign has been championing kicking racism out of our sport for years and is trying his damnedest to make this work , as have a lot of people			1
‘ people have got opinions but to stand as one block and try and fight against it is the best way			2
’ following an educational workshop for local children in 2011 , the then @entity4 manager @entity3 was quoted as saying : ‘ as a @entity64 we unite as one against racism			1
‘ football is a game followed by all and should an enjoyable experience , whatever their racial or ethnic background			0
we all have a role in stopping racism in sport , and society in general			2
’ positive : former @entity4 boss @entity3 ( right ) has spoken regularly of his admiration for @entity8 the @entity79 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity3 ’s time at @entity4			1
in the course of a search by the @entity64 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity3 ’s employment at @entity4 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity96 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity96 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			0
that said , @entity96 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity6 process is complete			2
the @entity79 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity96 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			0
if @entity96 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity96 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity6 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity132			2
@entity96 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			2
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity96 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity96 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity96 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity96 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity6 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter .			1
