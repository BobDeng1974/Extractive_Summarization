by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 05:22 est , 27 august 2012 thousands of @entity2 fans were lashed by torrential rain for two hours because of a health and safety ban on umbrellas at an open air concert			1
an audience of nearly 7,000 went home drenched to the skin after being told off by an on - stage presenter for opening brollies at the rain - sodden amphitheatre in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the teenagers sat shivering while heavy - handed security staff ensured no one breached the brolly ban throughout the show at the @entity20 on saturday night			1
i 'm with the band : @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 of @entity2 were covered by a roof - while those watching them were drenched while the band were covered by a section of roof , the crowd - who had paid £ 33 per ticket to see their idols - were forced to suffer			1
a local councillor said the ban at the venue had been standard from its opening , because large umbrellas ' could poke out someone 's eye '			1
but concert - goers were less impressed , with one teenager claiming her tonsils were so inflamed by the morning that she could neither speak nor swallow and needed emergency antibiotics			1
ice cream parlour worker @entity48 , 17 , from @entity50 , @entity13 , now faces at least a week off work			2
illness : @entity48 , 17 , was left with inflamed tonsils and forced to take a week off work after having to stand for two hours in torrential rain at the gig she said : ' by 8.30 it was absolutely pouring down			1
a lot of people were putting up their brollies and the security guards were telling everyone to put them down			2
' everyone was shocked and some people started refusing because it was torrential rain			2
' then a presenter came on stage and said , everyone needs to put their brollies down because it ’s a health and safety hazard			0
' he said " no one wants their eye poked out "			0
@entity2 were under a canopy but we had no shelter at all			0
' i could have walked out but i am a big @entity2 fan and had been looking forward to the concert for weeks			0
' her furious mother @entity80 , 47 , added : ' it ’s absolutely disgusting			0
she came home drenched with all her make - up running down her face			0
' you are allowed umbrellas at @entity88 and football matches which also have seated areas so why not here ? ' she was wet through and freezing and was laid up all night awake with painkillers			1
' it was a disappointing end to what should have been a great experience			0
' the concert should have been cancelled when it started pouring down and everyone given their money back			0
' @entity100 and tourism bosses from welcome to @entity14 hosted the event at @entity104 ’s largest open air theatre			1
councillor @entity105 , of @entity100 and welcome to @entity14 , said the theatre ’s umbrella ban had ' been a standard rule from the word go '			1
he added : ' if you put up one of those big golfing umbrellas you could really clobber someone - or poke them in the face or eye			1
' it is generally accepted that you ca n’t put umbrellas up			1
you can sit around on a bank at a stately home with umbrellas but not in an auditorium setting			2
sunnier times : the open air theatre has no sliding roof protection for visitors - ' because it would have been too expensive ' ' it is just one of those hazards			1
it was unfortunate it was such a poor night			0
i just hope that the majority of people were adequately dressed			0
' the theatre , closed since 1986 , reopened in 2010 following a £ 3.5million revamp , paid for by the profits made by redeveloping council - owned land on the seafront			0
' if the theatre was covered it would make it a more attractive venue			1
we did consider putting a sliding roof on			2
' but it would have added £ 1.5m to the cost and the council had already spent a lot of money restoring the theatre			0
' i do n’t think it is possible to cancel these things when they are being held under contract			1
they go ahead come what may			0
' thank goodness it did n't rain on her majesty ! the @entity159 watches a performance at the venue before officially re-opening it in 2010 however , @entity100 had already put the concert back a week			2
@entity2 ’s management said they had had to juggle with the tour dates to give the boy band more time in the recording studio			0
@entity169 , research director of the @entity170 ’ @entity168 , said : ' it ’s ridiculous that so much was spent making this venue water - tight , and now the slightest shower has ruined this event			2
' taxpayers will wonder where their hard - earned cash has gone , given that the @entity177 has to make necessary savings			0
' local authorities have to reassess their priorities and reduce spending , and spending like this can be cut out and re-focused on frontline services			0
