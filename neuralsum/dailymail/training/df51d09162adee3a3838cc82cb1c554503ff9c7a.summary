by @entity0 and @entity1 a state panel has effectively killed a bid to name a @entity5 cove for @entity6 , citing opposition from a tribe that says he held racist views on @entity11			1
the @entity12 this week voted to indefinitely table the request after hearing opposition from the @entity16 of @entity17 and @entity18 , whose ancestral homeland includes @entity5			1
supporters had sought to name a scenic cove on the lake 's northeast shore for @entity6 , @entity6 's real name			1
' racist ' : the @entity16 tribe in @entity17 claim @entity6 was racist towards @entity11 tahoe : supporters of @entity6 wanted to name a scenic cove on @entity5 after @entity6 because of the time he spent in the state but @entity31 , head of the tribe 's cultural resource department , said @entity6 was undeserving of the honor because of derogatory comments about the @entity16 and other tribes in his writings			1
among other things , he cited @entity6 's opposition to the naming of the lake as @entity5 , which is derived from the @entity16 word " da ow " for lake			1
@entity31 also objected to a @entity6 quote about @entity5 : ' people say that @entity5 means " @entity46 " - " @entity47 " - " @entity48			1
" @entity49 ! it means grasshopper soup , the favorite dish of the digger tribe - and of the pi - utes as well			1
' @entity31 said @entity55 dislike being referred to as the ' digger tribe , ' a derogatory term applied to some tribes in the @entity58 who dug roots for food			1
' @entity6 had racist views on the native people of this country and has captured those views in his literature , ' @entity31 wrote in a letter to the board			2
' therefore , we can not support the notion of giving a place name in @entity5 to @entity6			2
' @entity16 : @entity6 referred to members of the @entity16 tribe as the ' digger tribe ' which is a derogatory name term used to insult the tribe but @entity79 , history professor emeritus at the @entity80 , @entity81 , said it 's irrelevant whether @entity6 's writings were insulting to @entity11			1
the cove should be named for @entity6 because he praised @entity5 's beauty while visiting the lake in 1861 - 1862 , and he became one of @entity89 's most beloved authors after assuming his pen name as a @entity17 newspaper reporter around the same time , @entity79 said			1
' in his early days , ( @entity6 's ) ironic - comic mode was insulting to everyone , including governors , legislators , mine bosses and journalistic colleagues , ' he told the board			2
' he learned and overcame his prejudices far better than most of his contemporaries and successors			0
' @entity102 , an @entity103 professor emeritus at the @entity104 and leading @entity6 scholar , said the author eventually overcame his racism against blacks			0
but @entity109 said he has found no evidence that he significantly changed his views on @entity11			0
the @entity16 tribe still exists in @entity17 , where @entity6 lived for many years @entity6 did not embrace the idea of idolizing what he called the ' noble red man , ' @entity109 said , and poked fun at writer @entity117 for doing so			1
' when it comes to @entity119 , he was ahead of his time substantially , ' he said			0
' when it comes to @entity11 , his record is not very good			0
if he were alive today , he would sing a different tune			0
' board member @entity124 , who initiated the plan to name the cove for @entity6 , said it 's unlikely it would resurface			2
he said he dropped his support of it , even though he learned about a later letter @entity6 wrote objecting to the treatment of tribes in @entity134 and @entity135			0
' i have a great deal of respect for the @entity16			0
and if their cultural committee is unhappy with naming the cove for @entity6 , i 'm not going to fight them , ' @entity124 said			0
' we need to show sensitivity to the tribe			0
' @entity6 first used his pen name - ' @entity6 ' - while a reporter at a newspaper in @entity149 , @entity17 in the early 1860s @entity124 said he still believes the cove near @entity151 is where @entity6 camped and accidentally started a wildfire while preparing to cook dinner in september 1861			1
but @entity155 , a civil engineer from @entity156 , @entity18 , maintains @entity6 camped on the @entity18 side of the lake			0
it 's the second time the bid to name the cove for @entity6 failed			0
in 2011 , the @entity162 rejected the request after the @entity164 said @entity6 's influence on the @entity17 lake was minimal and other historical figures were more deserving of the honor			2
supporters sought to honor him because there is no geographic feature in the state named for @entity6 , whose book ' roughing it ' put @entity17 on the map .			2

@entity6 spent many years in @entity17 in the early 1860s and supporters wanted to name a scenic cove on @entity5 after the writer
born @entity6 , he began using his pen - name , ' @entity6 , ' while a reporter at a @entity17 newspaper
the @entity16 tribe of @entity17 claim @entity6 was racist against @entity11
members of the tribe cite *passages* he wrote about the ' digger tribe , ' a derogatory term for the @entity16
