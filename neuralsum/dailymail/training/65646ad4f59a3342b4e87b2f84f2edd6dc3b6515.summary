he said : ' we were invited by our @entity31 friends to join them on a night visit of a whale carcass , which had just been caught and harvested by @entity62			1
' being one of the first nations , @entity62 from @entity56 have the right to catch and harvest three whales every year , which they do in autumn			2
' the polar bears who come to @entity56 in autumn swim from free - flowing ice further north and have learned that there is always something left for them from the whale once the @entity62 have removed all the " good pieces "			1
' what is left are mostly bones with bits of meat - more than enough to feed the hungry bears for the day			0
' @entity94 : mr @entity53 said that the polar bears have learned that there is always something left for them from the whale once the @entity62 have removed all the ' good pieces ' nourishing : what the @entity31 hunters leave behind is mainly just bones and meat , but that 's more than enough to feed the hungry bears , the photographer said hungry as a bear : polar bears are the world 's largest land carnivores , rivalled only by the @entity112 brown bears of south - western @entity34 dr @entity113 would be proud : they usually feed on seals but , given the opportunity , are also known to eat walrus , beluga whale and bowhead whale carcasses not the most social characters : as adults , polar bears are generally solitary creatures - except during breeding and cub rearing collective noun : when they do gather together , like here , they are poetically described as an ' aurora ' of polar bears ; more mundanely they can also be dubbed a ' pack ' amazing spectacle : mr @entity53 described how the larger , adult bears were able to deal with the mammoth whale ribs ' as if they did n't weigh anything ' ' a fat bear is a happy bear ' : polar bears are considered one of the few animals who actively hunt humans - but mr @entity53 said he felt relaxed among them @entity145 and old : ' bear sows were letting their cubs squeeze in next to male bears , although this would never be possible during the day , ' said mr @entity53 polar party : he described how the fierce predators ' were all dirty from mud and blood , chewing , cracking bones , squelching and growling ' polar bears are the world 's largest land carnivores , rivalled only by the @entity112 brown bears of south - western @entity34			1
sitting at the top of the @entity58 food chain , they usually feed on seals but , given the opportunity , are also known to eat walrus , beluga whale and bowhead whale carcasses			2
they are only very rarely seen eating vegetation			0
as adults , polar bears are generally solitary creatures - except during breeding and cub rearing			1
however , when they do gather together , as in these pictures , they are poetically described as an ' aurora ' of polar bears , although more mundanely they can also be dubbed a ' pack '			2
last bits : in the morning seagulls arrived to scavenge the few morsels left on the whale bones by the hungry pack of polar bears picked clean : a polar bear mother stands amid the stripped remains of the whale carcass with her two cubs after the night - long feast full up : two large adult polar bears are either sharing a touching moment or roaring in each other 's faces in this picture taken after the feed is over playtime : having eaten their fill , the two savage beasts appear to frolic among the remains of the whale carcass , with most of their peers already departed mr @entity53 added : ' we went in a small group of four and came to see an amazing @entity205 was a feast of over 20 bears of all sizes , from small cubs to large males			1
they were all dirty from mud and blood , chewing , cracking bones , squelching and growling			0
' the larger bears were easily dealing with huge whale ribs as if they did n't weigh anything			0
' @entity217 were letting their cubs squeeze in next to male bears , although this would never be possible during the day			0
' their only goal was to get as fat as possible , quickly			0
some of them could hardly drag their bellies , since this was their second whale of the year and they were already full after finishing the leftovers from the first one			0
' polar bears are considered one of the few animals who actively hunt humans - but mr @entity53 said he felt relaxed among them			1
he added : ' a fat bear is a happy bear			0

the *incredible* scene was captured near the @entity31 village of @entity56 on the edge of the @entity58 in @entity34
animals were feasting on leftover whale carcass after it was hunted and *butchered* by local @entity31 *tribesmen*
normally polar bears are solitary animals , but the mammoth *quantity* of food on offer made them happy to share
