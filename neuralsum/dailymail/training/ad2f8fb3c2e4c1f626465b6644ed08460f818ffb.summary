the 2001 court transcripts were made public by the state @entity12 , which had tried to air the documents before the november 6 election			2

happy couple : @entity22 rep. @entity2 speaks to supporters on election day with his second wife , @entity25 , left by his side victory : @entity2 , center , easily won a second term despite damaging revelations that he once urged a patient with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion the 48 - year - old congressman , whose campaign platform opposed abortion , acknowledged the conversation but said he was only trying to get her to admit she was n't pregnant			1
the transcripts obtained by the @entity39 show that woman testified under oath that she had been expecting			2
she declined to elaborate on the outcome of the pregnancy			0
on his campaign website , @entity2 espoused an anti-abortion position , saying : ‘ all life should be cherished and protected			2
’ the 48 - year - old medic also scored a 100 per cent rating from the @entity50			1
according to @entity2 ' testimony , the first of his ex-wife , @entity52 's , abortions was because she was taking an experimental drug that carried potential risks in pregnancy			1
the second came amid problems in their relationship			0
both pregnancies were terminated before the couple got married in 1995			0
‘ things were not going well between us and it was a mutual decision , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n't think that it was easy for either one of us			0
i think it was a very difficult and poor choice and i think that there are probably regrets both ways			0
’ @entity2 ' first wife had supported earlier efforts to release the court records , though her attorney said thursday he had n't had time to review them enough to comment			2
more trouble : according to newly released transcripts from @entity2 ' divorce proceedings , the 48 - year - old pro-lifer signed off on his wife 's two abortions in 1995 @entity86 chairman @entity85 issued a statement to @entity88 in response to the explosive revelations , saying ion part : ‘ congressman @entity2 ' lies have come home to roost			1

unfaithful : the documents claim that @entity2 , who ran on a family - values platform , had multiple affairs with at least two patients and several co-workers ‘ @entity2 has acted irresponsibly , his actions are contemptible and his tangled web of deceit is sickening			1
@entity2 should be barred from practicing medicine , and he should give up his seat in @entity114 to make way for someone worthy of the trust that @entity118 instill in their elected officials			0
’ the 670 - page divorce transcript also revealed that @entity121 who ran on a conservative , family - values platform , had sexual relationships with at least two patients , three co-workers and a drug representative while he was chief of staff at @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity3 , in 2000 while he was married to first wife			1
@entity2 could potentially lose his medical license since doctors are prohibited from engaging in sexual relationships with patients			2
according to the @entity137 , ‘ sexual contact that occurs concurrent with the patient - physician relationship constitutes sexual misconduct			2
’ during the 2001 divorcé trial , the physician - turned politician challenged the idea that his conduct , which included writing prescriptions for one of his paramours , was in any way reprehensible			0
' i do n't feel real obligated to respond to that			0
i think it 's ludicrous , ' he said			0
