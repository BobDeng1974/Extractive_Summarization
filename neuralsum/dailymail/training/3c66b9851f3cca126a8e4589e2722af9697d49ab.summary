in a picturesque village in the @entity3 mountains , an 82 - year - old woman is putting her middle aged children into nappies			2
mrs @entity6 , who lives in a small village called @entity8 , in @entity9 , is forced to take care of her three children despite being an old woman herself			2
her children have been afflicted with the village 's curse : something they called ' @entity17 ' : the foolishness			1
the curse means many of the village 's 5,000 residents have a genetic mutation that predisposes them to alzheimer 's disease – and most develop the condition by the time they are just 40 years old			1
doctors say 5,000 people in the village of @entity8 , @entity9 ( pictured ) , are at risk of developing early onset @entity33 because of a genetic mutation passed down and spread through intermarriage @entity8 is based in the @entity38 area of @entity9			1
people from this area call themselves ' paisa ' , meaning countrymen , and the mutation which causes @entity33 's has come to be known as the ' paisa ' mutation ' to see your children like this , it 's horrible , horrible			1
' mrs @entity6 told the @entity48 , ' i would n't wish this on a rabid dog			0
it is the most terrifying illness on the face of the earth			0
' one of her sons , @entity57 , 55 , has to be tied to a chair with blue shorts as he squirms so vigorously , shredding his nappy with his hands			0
her daughter , @entity62 , 61 , is mute and fed by a nose tube			0
previously , she had violent rages			0
@entity66 was a nurse but started to forget her patients ' medications at age 48			0
mrs @entity6 ' other son , @entity70 , 50 , can only remember to buy one item at a time from the shop			2
many of the 5,000 villagers who live in @entity8 have inherited the mutation that pre-disposes them to @entity33 's and intermarriage has accelerated its spread			1
it was inherited from the village 's @entity81 ancestors , and those from the @entity38 area of @entity9 now call themselves ' paisa ' , meaning countrymen			1

a single parent can pass down the mutation , located on the 14th chromosome – which causes a devastating form of early - onset alzheimer 's			1
those who have the mutation have a 50 per cent chance of developing @entity33 's , sometimes as early as 32 years old			1
the disease begins with forgetfulness but slowly progresses to being disorientated , having delusional ideas and being aggressive			2
in some families , parents and children have progressed through the illness together , from memory loss to dementia			2

in some families , parents and children have progressed through the illness together , from memory loss to dementia			2
but a neurologist named @entity118 , who grew up in @entity8 , hopes there is a blessing in the village 's curse			1
thirty years ago , dr @entity118 , the head of the neuroscience program at the @entity124 , set himself an ambitious mission : to find a treatment to prevent @entity33 's , the most common form of dementia in the world			1
' most treatments have failed because they 're administered too late			0
our strategy is to intervene before the disease destroys the brain , ' dr @entity118 said			2
alzheimer 's disease is caused by parts of the brain wasting away			1
it is not known exactly what causes this process to begin , although people with the condition have been found to have abnormal amounts of proteins called amyloid plaques , fibres and a chemical called acetylcholine in the brain			2
these reduce the effectiveness of the brain 's nerve calls and gradually destroying them			0
over time this damage spreads to several areas of the brain , such as the grey matter ( responsible for processing thoughts ) and the hippocampus ( responsible for memory )			0
@entity118 , a neurologist who grew up in @entity8 , has set himself an ambitious mission : to find a treatment to prevent @entity33 's			1
he is trialling a new drug on 300 of the village 's residents for several months , dr @entity118 been testing an experimental drug on a group of 300 healthy patients aged 30 to 60 years old who have the paisa mutation			1
the active molecule in his drug targets the proteins that attack the brain and lead to dementia			1
the trials are part of a $ 100 million ( £ 65 milion ) project financed by the @entity178 and @entity179 in the @entity180 , as well as @entity182 pharmaceutical group @entity181			0
the results are expected around 2020			2
the stakes are high worldwide : more than 36 million people suffer from @entity33 's and , without a cure , the number could rise to 66 million in 2030 and 115 million in 2050 , according to the @entity188			1
that 's nearly one new case every four seconds — three times the rate of hiv infections			0
' we do n't know what causes @entity33 's , but for one per cent of the cases worldwide , it 's genetic in origin			1
' and that opens a very important window toward finding a preventive treatment , ' said dr @entity118 , who estimates 5,000 people are at risk in and around @entity8			0
at his university , a small room filled with refrigerators and formaldehyde jars holds a ' brain bank ' created with organ donations from local residents — an invaluable research source			0
' it was very hard for them to accept , in addition to their suffering , donating their loved ones ' brains , ' said @entity218 , a nurse in the neuroscience department who organises cognitive stimulation workshops for patients			0
the @entity188 predicts 115 million people worldwide will have @entity33 's by 2050			1
pictured is a brain scan of a 74 - year - old patient with the condition ' but without that social link , the scientific project could never have seen the light of day , ' she said			0
herself a fit 60 - something with no plans to retire , she has lived @entity8 's nightmare along with residents			2
' some say they 'd rather kill themselves			0
then they get sick and they forget , ' she said			0
@entity237 — an energetic , 72 - year - old grandmother from @entity8 who has settled in the regional capital @entity239 — said she is praying for dr @entity118 's treatment to work			0
two of her daughters , aged 43 and 47 , are suffering memory loss and ' becoming small children again , ' she said			0
another daughter , 53 - year - old @entity246 , is ' just a body ' who drinks from a baby bottle			0
' i 've trusted my children to @entity252			0
it 's his decision , ' she said .			0

villagers have a mutation that predisposes them to early onset @entity33 's
people with the mutation have a 50 *%* chance of developing @entity33 's
intermarriage among village residents has accelerated spread of disease
neurologist born in the village is testing a new drug on residents
he hopes to find a cure for dementia , and will *publish* results in 2020
