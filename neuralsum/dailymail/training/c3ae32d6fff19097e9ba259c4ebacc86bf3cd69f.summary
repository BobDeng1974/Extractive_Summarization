@entity7 , of @entity8 , is struggling to find new homes for the animals after they were abandoned or given away by their owners			1
they are among about 60 cats which the @entity8 charity ms @entity7 works for , @entity16 , is trying to rehome - the largest number in the organisation 's 10 - year history			1
the charity has even warned it may have to start turning cats away unless new owners come forward			1
needing a home : this kitten is one of 30 that have been taken in by @entity7 in @entity8 ms @entity7 is fostering 30 kittens at her home , while a further 30 mature cats are being cared by for by other charity workers			1
ms @entity7 said : ' there are cats all over the place			1
normally i have about half a dozen at a time , but now i sometimes get three or four pregnant cats a week			1
' for the past two years , and especially since @entity38 , numbers have been growing			1
' i have had 17 pregnant cats since @entity38 , then you will get four or five in a litter			2
the baby kittens used to be quite easy to re-home , but not now			0
' i have been doing this for 11 - years now , and my house has never been so crowded with them			0
' some of the kittens are still with me after five months , which is very unusual			0
' overrun : ms @entity7 said the number of cats in her care had risen so quickly that her friends had offered to foster some until new homes can be found ms @entity7 said the number of cats in her care had risen so quickly that her friends had offered to foster some until new homes can be found			1
the sharp increase in numbers is being blamed on the recession			1
staff say people who see animal breeding as a quick way of making money can later find they are unable to look after them			2
ms @entity62 said : ' i think part of the problem is that it is so easy now to advertise animals for sale on @entity68			0
' you get people eager to make some quick money by breeding cats			2
' they think they are being clever business people , making £ 40 or £ 50 a cat , but often they ca n’t sell them quickly enough as people want the kittens when they are very young , and then they find they ca n’t cope			2
' they do n’t have to pay to advertise in a newspaper			0
@entity68 is really convenient for them			0
' then the cats are getting dumped , or brought here			2
' warning : @entity78 , the animal charity 's co-founder , has admitted it may have to start turning cats away warning that pets ' always suffer ' during a recession , ms @entity7 called for more financial help to be made available to owners who need to have their cats neutered			1
she added : ' at the moment my house is completely crowded with cats , scratching my doors and making a mess			2
' but i have some really lovely kittens and i just hope there are some people out there who are willing to give them a home			0
' @entity78 , co-founder of @entity16 , who has nine rescue cats at her home , said : ' we ’ve just had our 10 - year anniversary and this is the most amount of cats we ’ve ever had to re-home			1
' we get cats for a variety of reasons , sometimes people tell us they need to get rid of their cat because they ’ve just had a baby or fallen pregnant , we ’re getting an increasing number of people who say that the council will not let them have more than two pets			0
' the council and housing associations seem to be cracking down on the amount of pets people can have in their properties in recent years			0
' sometimes people come to us with genuine reasons - for example			0
elderly people who are unable to care for their pet due to ill health			0
' we get a lot of pedigree cats and people do n’t seem to be getting them neutered			0
' we ’re getting to the point that there are so many , we might have to turn some away and we do n’t want to do that			0
