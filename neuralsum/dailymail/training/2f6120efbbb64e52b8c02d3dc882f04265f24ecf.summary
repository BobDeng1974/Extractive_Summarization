@entity8 once sat next to @entity10 at a boozy dinner party in @entity72 , and made what @entity10 recalled as ' very specific ' suggestions about the design of lightsabres , it claims			2
' it was just a conversation , ' @entity8 told the magazine			0
although he 'd said nothing about cross guards , he had made a case for unevenness ' i thought it would be interesting if it were less precise , and just a little bit more spitty a redesigned weapon could be ' more analog and more primitive , and i think , in that way , somehow more ominous			0
' the result of an ambitious $ 4.05 billion buyout that saw @entity97 acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from @entity100 in november 2012 , the hugely popular first trailer revealed a new weapon - a fiery new lightsabre , with a cross guard , and a resemblance to a burning crucifix			0
@entity16 was aware of @entity9 's latest product , the @entity18 , before his death , @entity8 said			1
in the interview , @entity8 also reveals the firm 's secret office on @entity9 's @entity112 capmpus			1
' the room is about three thousand square feet , though its outsized reputation has led it to be described as ' cavernous ; it ends in a glass wall , behind which stand three eight - foot - high computer - numerical - control ( @entity119 ) milling machines that shape plastic and metal to produce models and prototype parts			0
@entity8 's small team of designers work 12 hour days , and when @entity8 designed the space he wanted these machines to be as integrated into the studio as noise and dust pollution allowed			1
' they make physical objects , and that is what we 're doing , ' he told his interviewer			0
' @entity16 was the most focused person i 've met in my life			1
' it 's terrifying that when you really truly focus , it seems a bit illegal			2
' you can achieve so much			0
' what focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you 're focused on something else			0
i remember talking to @entity16 and asked why he was perceived as harsh			1
' and i said could n't we be more moderate ? and he said why ? and i said because i care about the team			0
' and he said : ' no jony , you 're just really vain			0
you just want people to like you			0
i 'm surprised at you , because i thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people			0
'' ' people misunderstand @entity16 because he was so focused ' toward the end of his life , @entity16 told @entity163 , ' if i had a spiritual partner at @entity9 , it 's @entity8			1
jony and i think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say , ' hey , what do you think about this ? ' ' he gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product			0
' and he understands that @entity9 is a product company			1
' he 's not just a designer			2
that 's why he works directly for me			2
he has more operational power than anyone else at @entity9 except me			1
' @entity8 also spoke at a special celebration of @entity16 life , held on the lawn at @entity183 , @entity9 's office			1
' @entity16 used to say to me — and he used to say this a lot — ' hey , @entity8 , here 's a dopey idea			1
' ' and sometimes they were : really dopey			0
sometimes they were truly dreadful			0
but sometimes they took the air from the room , and they left us both completely silent			0
' bold , crazy , magnificent ideas			0
or quiet , simple ones which , in their subtlety , their detail , they were utterly profound			0
' @entity8 said to me , ' i could n't be more mindful of him			0
' how could i not , given our personal relationship , and given that i 'm still designing in the same place , at the same table , where i spent the last fifteen years with him sat next to me ? ' the @entity18 was conceived ' close to @entity16 's death , ' @entity8 said			1
@entity8 is also believed to have been the designer of @entity58 ( left ) from the @entity206 hit film @entity207 @entity8 's small team of designers work 12 hour days			2
