the birth of the @entity1 and @entity2 of @entity4 ’s first child , our future monarch , is an occasion for great joy			2
but in recent days i have found myself thinking how much @entity10 would have relished the role of grandmother			1
in her all too brief time on the world stage , we saw how good she was with children : she had the ability to get into a child ’s mind ; her wicked sense of fun was infectious ; and she could put even the most over-awed child instantly at ease			1
she proved communication is not just about the spoken word — a look and a caress can be more eloquent than words			0
indeed , she embraced any woman she saw who happened to be pregnant			0
seeing photographs of the @entity49 shopping for baby clothes with her mother made me terribly sad that @entity10 was n’t around to be part of the ritual and fun of the run - up to the birth			1
i experienced how much she enjoyed this at first hand when i became pregnant at the relatively late age of 38			0
i had met @entity10 only the month before i conceived through our mutual friend , the then @entity65 ambassador ’s wife , @entity62			1
the life and soul : a drenched princess @entity10 with @entity68 ( centre ) and @entity33 on the @entity70 at @entity71 in 1997 devoted to her boys : @entity10 with @entity33 ( left ) and @entity35 , joined by nanny @entity73 in the background in @entity75 , @entity76 when i was seven months pregnant , i was invited to @entity77 to have lunch with @entity10			1
she had been following my pregnancy closely and had been full of practical advice			0
but the reason for this lunch invitation became clear as soon as i had sat down			0
‘ what shopping have you done for the baby ? ’ she demanded			1
‘ nothing yet , ’ i replied			1
‘ i ’m busy at work			2
’ i was working full - time as ceo of @entity90 in @entity91			1
@entity10 got up from the table , went to her writing desk and came back with a two - page type - written list of everything i would require — the same list she had used for her own two babies			1
she still had it , even though @entity33 was by then nine and @entity35 seven			0
another baby for @entity10 : the princess leaving hospital with prince @entity35 , 16 september 1984 ( pictured left ) and posing for a formal family picture with prince @entity33 a month later she told me firmly that i needed to ‘ get organised ’			1
yes , @entity103 ! a few weeks later , @entity10 rang me at work and said she was going to take me in hand , as she assumed — rightly — that i still had n’t been anywhere near a baby shop			1
she gave me a date and told me to bring my list			2
a few days later she collected me from @entity90 ’s headquarters and rushed me off to @entity111 in @entity77 ( since closed down , unfortunately )			2
@entity10 was a whirlwind of efficiency , sweeping items off the shelves and into our trolley — things i had never even heard of , let alone understood what they could possibly be for			1
@entity120 and @entity10 with baby @entity33 in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 in 1983			1
@entity10 insisted @entity33 travel with the couple abroad the shop assistant was flustered at the till as @entity10 handed over her credit card			1
indeed , i think it was one of the first times she had used it , rather than paying in cash , and she was rather excited about it			0
as we left , struggling to walk under mounds of baby equipment , the shop door alarm went off because , in her confusion , the assistant had forgotten to remove one of the security tags			0
so , we had to stagger back to the till , causing still more confusion — and stares of amazement from other mothers - to - be			0
full of fun : here @entity10 is pictured with her sons , @entity35 in the middle and @entity33 on the right , in the garden of @entity150 in @entity151 , 1986			1
@entity33 is wearing a @entity153 t - shirt when we finally collapsed into the car , @entity10 consulted her list once more			1
‘ do n’t worry about a pram , ’ she said			1
‘ you can borrow mine — and i can give you @entity33 ’s moses basket			1
’ a few days later , a vast @entity161 pram was delivered to our house , with the moses basket inside			2
@entity10 ’s attentions did n’t end there			1
about three weeks before i was due , she came round to tea			0
she knew i was edgy and within minutes asked me what was wrong			0
i promptly burst into tears and admitted i was scared : that i was the sort of woman who could run @entity90 ’s , but had no idea how i would cope with having a child , let alone the ghastly ( in my eyes ) process of giving birth			2
a protective hand : @entity10 carries her son , prince @entity35 , off a flight at @entity180 she calmed me down and then organised a session for me with birthing guru @entity182 , who had advised @entity10 during her pregnancies			1
this terrifying but wonderful woman , then in her late 70s , arrived at my house a few days later			0
she taught me breathing techniques and tried to show me how to relax			0
i can still hear @entity10 roaring with laughter when i told her how @entity182 had bossed around my husband , @entity189 , as soon as he walked through the front door			1
my first daughter , @entity192 , was born just before @entity193			0
i was still in the delivery room when i was told by a nurse that @entity10 was on the phone			1
the next morning a beautiful china pot arrived full of plants , with a note saying : ‘ @entity201 , just the biggest hurrah possible			2
’ she was round the next day to have a cuddle — with the baby , obviously			2
after prince @entity33 's birth in 1982 at @entity205 : @entity206 ( seated left ) , @entity10 , @entity207 , and prince @entity120 and the @entity1 ( standing ) as soon as i arrived , @entity10 would meet me halfway down the stairs , scoop up @entity192 and take over			1
when my second daughter , @entity209 , was born two - and - a - half years later , @entity10 again came to the fore			2
@entity209 was very weak in the first months of her life because she had @entity213 ’s syndrome , with added complications			0
@entity10 would visit my house in @entity216 , @entity91 , and just sit with her to give me a break			2
she came with me to hospital appointments and asked questions of the medics when i was incapable of doing so			0
she had a tenderness that was extraordinary to witness			0
today , as i think of @entity33 and @entity223 ’s new baby , i remember how @entity10 was with my two daughters			1
how she would appear at bath - time , turn up at birthday parties and invite us all to lunch at @entity77 so she could play with them			0
she encouraged @entity192 to do ballet , showed her the basic moves and lay down on the floor with her to do stretches			0
@entity10 gave her a pair of ballet shoes signed by the stars of the @entity238 , which , 16 years later , still hang on her bedroom wall			2
we should not forget that @entity10 ’s first job was as a nursery school teacher			1
it had been clear even then that she was wonderful with children and , indeed , it was the only part of her life in which she had complete confidence			0
it makes it seem all the more cruel she has been denied the pleasure of being with her grandson			0
this much - awaited baby will , i am sure , be the cause of national celebration			0
the birth of their first son will only increase worldwide interest in the @entity1 and @entity49 as they move from being a couple to becoming a family			0
@entity10 ’s legacy , which until now has lain with her sons , will extend to a new generation			1
@entity10 was made to be a mother			2
her nurturing instinct was the best part of her character			0
she would have been the most magnificent grandmother and it makes me ineffably sad she will not be a part of the royal baby ’s life			0
but , of course , my feelings are as nothing to those that prince @entity33 will experience			0
one thing is certain for me , however			0
no matter how much @entity278 involves herself in the birth and early years of her first grandchild , her attentions could not be greater than those @entity10 would have provided .			2

in her all too brief time , we saw how good she was with children
she told me firmly that i needed to ‘ get organised ’ . yes , @entity103 !
@entity10 was efficient , sweeping items off the shelves and into our trolley
@entity10 ’s legacy will extend to a new generation
