by @entity0 @entity1 has vowed not to change his style as he seeks to avoid that ' if only ' feeling come the end of the season			2
following the team orders furore during the @entity7 @entity6 on sunday , @entity1 remained defiant he had done nothing wrong			1
in ignoring instructions to let by @entity14 team - mate and title rival @entity11 on lap 51 - given the two drivers were running different strategies - @entity1 put his own interests first ahead of the team			1
third : remarkably , @entity1 finished on the podium despite starting from the pit lane in @entity7 @entity20 should have obeyed team orders - @entity11 on the other hand , @entity1 is not there to hand @entity11 a free pass to this year 's championship as he has no doubt he would have finished behind the @entity27 in @entity7 if he had let him through			1
instead , @entity1 grabbed a stunning third having started in the pit lane after a fire during qualifying wrecked his car , with @entity11 a place further back in fourth , to cut the gap between the two to 11 points			1
it was the second astonishing drive from @entity37 in a week , bearing in mind he started 20th in the @entity27 @entity6 and again went on to finish third after a brake - disc failure in qualifying			2
reflecting on his decision in @entity7 once the adrenaline had abated , the 29 - year - old said : ' it was not about questioning authority , and i do n't think i was being ruthless			2
problems : in both the @entity7 and @entity27 @entity6 @entity1 had mechanical problems in qualifying strained : the relationship between @entity11 and @entity1 has become strained in recent months ' i was not even being bloody minded			1
i was doing my job and got to the top			0
' i am hired to race and bring in points for the team			2
i am also hired to be me and race my heart out			0
' i did not start at the front of the pack			0
i started from the pit lane , so in my mind i could not afford to lose anything else			1
i have already given away too much			0
' at the end of the year i could be looking back saying ' if only the car did not catch on fire ' , or ' if only the brakes did n't fail ' , ' if only i had n't made a mistake in qualifying ' , ' if only the engine had not stopped in the race ' ... all these things			0
' so it was just a case of not giving a single point away			0
i tried my hardest to be ahead and i do n't feel as though i was being obligated to help			0
