" ' in terms of the sexual abuse , i did n't know that that 's what it was , i just knew i did n't like it			1

his alleged victim , @entity82 , said the abuse was so shrouded in religious context he came to believe he was living closer to @entity141 by submitting himself			1
' he began kissing me and told me about the breath of life			0
' the abuse was progressive and relied heavily on religion to justify what he was doing to me			2
' mr @entity82 contacted the @entity149 in @entity31 with his claims , but was told the priest , now a frail man in his eighties , was not of sound enough mind or body to either face extradition or carry out official duties			1
while it has never publicly acknowledged that any abuse was carried out , the order added that the man was being kept out of the reach of children			2
@entity38 in @entity39 where the men say they were subjected to routine sexual abuse as children in the 1960s and 70s a 2008 photograph of him performing a religious ceremony while standing next to a young girl in @entity31 however prompted mr @entity82 to contact the @entity28			1

this person left the @entity29 for @entity31 at the time of the alleged offences and has not returned since then			1
' in spring 2013 , new evidence came to light and we reopened the case with the hope of bringing someone to justice			0
' we have conducted a thorough investigation and have been in close liaison with the authorities in @entity31 and the @entity195 but , unfortunately we need to interview the suspect in this case and he is unable to travel from @entity31 voluntarily due to ill health			1
' all legal avenues have been pursued to enforce his return to @entity29 but his ill health means we are unable to go through the formal procedures to extradite him			1
' the investigation is not closed but has reached a point where we ca n't go any further			0
' when contacted by @entity53 , the @entity13 said it was ' dismayed ' by allegations of abuse and had cooperated with police enquiries - but would not acknowledge that any of the men had been abused despite damages having been awarded			1
