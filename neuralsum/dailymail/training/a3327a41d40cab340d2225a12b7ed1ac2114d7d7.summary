a new pregnancy - style @entity2 test could give health workers on the front line in @entity7 accurate diagnoses within 15 minutes , it has been claimed			1
@entity9 scientists are in the pre-production phases of the test , which they claim will ' dramatically cut times ' for medical teams working in the field			1
the small white plastic kit is in development and resembles a traditional pregnancy test			1
it can be used without specialised equipment , speeding up the process of testing for the virus , the researchers from a branch of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) said			1
researcher @entity44 , said : ' this test works like a traditional pregnancy test available in a pharmacy			2
' we place a sample , a drop of blood , serum , plasma or urine , which moves towards this band			1
' the virus then gets caught by antibodies , already present on the bands			1
' then depending on the results , you get a coloured reaction			1
' the new test has already undergone trials in a high - security laboratory in @entity65 to obtain a licence , using the strain of the disease currently spreading through @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			2
the head of the laboratory , @entity72 said he expects to begin to roll out the tests on a larger scale at the beginning of 2015			2
' we are in a pre-production phase , ' he said			1
' the tests we 're working with now are prototypes which helped us make adjustments			2
blood tests and other tests currently take between 24 hours and three days to yield results the new test can be used without specialised equipment , speeding up the process of testing for the virus , the researchers from a branch of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) said a sample , a drop of blood , serum , plasma or urine , is placed on the band			1
the virus then gets caught by antibodies , already present on the bands			1
depending on the results , you get a coloured reaction a vaccine to protect millions from the ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor @entity107 nations			1
the head of the @entity35 's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the haemorrhagic fever - the majority in @entity71 , @entity70 and @entity69			0
@entity35 director general dr @entity114 addressed the regional committee for @entity7 in @entity116 dr @entity114 , director general of the @entity35 , criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on ' markets that can not pay '			0
she said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two @entity35 arguments ' that have fallen on deaf ears for decades '			0
addressing the regional committee for @entity7 in @entity116 yesterday , dr @entity125 said : ' @entity2 emerged nearly four decades ago			0
why are clinicians still empty handed , with no vaccines and no cure ? ' because @entity2 has historically been confined to poor @entity107 nations			0
' the r&d ( research and development ) incentive is virtually non-existent			0
' a profit - driven industry does not invest in products for markets that can not pay			0
' @entity35 has been trying to make this issue visible for ages			0
now people can see it for themselves			0
' ' we expect to have a few hundred of them in the coming days in order to start the clinical validation phase			2
' production can then start at the beginning of 2015 on a larger scale which will be adapted according to requirements in the field			2
' the aim of these rapid tests is to be able to conduct diagnosis as close as possible to the affected communities			2
fast tests are also under development in several other countries			0
@entity157 researchers announced last month they found a new method to detect the virus in 30 minutes , while @entity161 researchers are also working on a test that could give results in 10 minutes			1
the most deadly outbreak of @entity2 on record has killed nearly 5,000 people , all but a handful of them in @entity70 , @entity69 and @entity71			0
there are a number of tests currently used to diagnose @entity2			0
the majority work within a few days of the onset of symptoms , detecting the virus 's genetic material or the presence of antibodies against the pathogen			1
the most accurate of these is a polymerase chain reaction ( @entity183 ) test , a technique that looks for genetic material from the virus and creates copies of it that can be deteched , dr @entity189 , an infectious disease specialist at @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity193 , told @entity194			1
he said : ' @entity183 is a really definitive test			0
it can pick up very small amounts of the virus			2
' but the test has its drawbacks			0
it can be negative in the first three days			0
dr @entity202 , a specialist at the @entity203 , added : ' somebody could be in the hospital for three to five days before a diagnosis is confirmed			1
' the important thing is keeping the patient isolated until you can get a diagnosis			0
' another test for @entity2 looks at the antibodies produced by the body 's immune system in response to the virus			1
the antigen - capture enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( @entity220 ) , can take longer than three days to give a positive result .			0

the new test is in the pre-production phase , say @entity9 scientists
small white plastic kit can be used without specialist equipment speeding up the diagnosis process and giving results within 15 minutes
a drop of blood , urine , serum or plasma is placed on the test
the virus is then caught by antibodies already present in the bands
depending the results , the test *provokes* a coloured reaction
researchers say the test could be available as early as *january* 2015
currently tests for the virus can take between 24 hours and three days
