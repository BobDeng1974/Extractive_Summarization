@entity3 agents allowed a convicted felon and former member of a domestic terrorist group to pass through an expedited security line , @entity1 's internal watchdog has revealed			1
the passenger , whose identity has not been released , has served years in prison for murder and offenses involving explosives , the @entity1 's inspector general 's @entity8 said as it revealed the ' significant aviation security breach ' in a statement on thursday night			1
the watchdog was asked to investigate the june 2014 incident last october after a whistleblower came forward			1
it did not release specific details of the passenger 's criminal history or where the incident took place			0
the passenger , who is a @entity29 citizen , had not registered for the @entity3 's @entity31 program , but if they had , they would have been rejected because of their convictions , the office said in the statement			1
' significant security breach ' : a passenger who has convictions for murder and offenses involving explosives was allowed to pass through the @entity3 's @entity31 line ( file picture ) despite an agent recognizing them instead , they were selected for the screening through the @entity47 program 's ' risk assessment rules ' , the watchdog said			1
the program compares information the traveler has given their airline with information from the @entity54 , no fly lists and other intelligence - based systems to determine if they can board the plane and to identify low - risk passengers for expedited screening			0
after determining a passenger can be pre-screened , it allows them to print documents carrying the @entity31 sign			0
the @entity3 was unable to show the traveler 's vetting results because they are deleted seven days after travel , the inspector general 's @entity8 said			1
when the passenger reached the airport , an agent looked at their documents			0
' after checking the traveler 's boarding pass and identification , an alert transportation security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor , ' the watchdog said , @entity81 reported			2
' however , the supervisor directed the [ officer ] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the @entity3 pre-check lane			2
' as part of the @entity31 system , the passenger - who has a criminal history involving explosives - would not have had to take off their shoes or jackets or remove liquids from their carry - on luggage			1
investigation : the @entity3 responded that all passengers , including those with @entity31 tickets , are subject to ' robust ' checks			2
it is not known where the june 2014 breach took place the incident was brought to the attention of the inspector general 's @entity8 's after a whistleblower went to the @entity29 @entity8 , an independent federal investigative agency			1
a classified report was issued to @entity3 detailing the need to make changes to the @entity31 vetting and screening process			0
on thursday , the @entity3 said in a statement that it ' takes its responsibility for protecting the traveling public very seriously '			0
' all passengers , including those with @entity31 on boarding passes , are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security , both seen and unseen , ' it said			0
the @entity3 added that the success of its pre-screening system relies on the intelligence and national law enforcement communities identifying passengers they believe to pose a risk - yet this passenger had not been place on one of their lists			2
still , the agency said it was reviewing the guidelines it provides to @entity3 officers and supervisors to ensure they ' clearly understand the procedure in the event a person or item presents a creditable threat to transportation security ' .			0

the *unidentified* passenger had convictions for murder and offenses related to explosives , said @entity1 's inspector general 's @entity8
despite this , the traveler was issued a ticket allowing them to take the @entity31 lane
a @entity3 agent recognized the felon and told their supervisor - but the supervisor allowed the passenger to go through anyway
@entity31 means passengers can keep on their jackets , do not need to remove shoes and do not need to take liquids out of their luggage
the watchdog , which began investigating in october after a whistleblower came forward , did not say where the june 2014 incident took place
@entity3 said it takes its responsibility to protect the public ' very seriously '
