the village of @entity1 on the @entity2 will be the best spot to view friday 's solar eclipse - and the only b&b in the area still has a room available for the spectacle			1
the west side of @entity2 is the best place in the country to view the event , and @entity13 has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across @entity16 and @entity17 wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse			1
@entity21 viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and @entity23 are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand			1
@entity40 is @entity1 's only b&b			1
proprietor @entity43 - @entity42 had sold both her spare rooms - but one , costing £ 75 - a - night , was to a couple of @entity47 eclipse chasers			1
' they have had to unfortunately cancel			2
he wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises			2
so the room is free , ' said mrs @entity42			1
@entity1 is set to be the best place for viewing friday 's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent the village of @entity1 has only one @entity41 , and one couple 's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse the @entity2 is als famous for the @entity69 prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old ' ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until i told them			1
they were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them			2
' we have a glorious view all the way to the @entity79 but the eclipse has helped put @entity1 on the map			1
it will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists			2
but it is a long way to come on the off chance			2
@entity1 is a village on the @entity2 , in the @entity91 , @entity92			1
@entity1 is within the parish of @entity94			1
known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape			2
@entity1 is mainly a former @entity100 camp , high above sea level , used by the @entity102 to man a vital communications post			1
the giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting @entity1 listed as an official dark skies spot			1
@entity111 , who runs the small four star hotel @entity112 at @entity114 in @entity1 , said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from @entity117 - paying £ 135 - a - night			1
' i think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse , ' he said			2
pupils at @entity94 primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes			0
@entity128 , chairman of @entity129 , said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons			2
' many of our members have opened up in march especially for the eclipse , ' he said			0
' we have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok			0
@entity141 had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse			0
we are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once - in - a - lifetime early boost			0
' people coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like @entity141 where people just hopped in a car			0
' we have the best view in the @entity16 and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them			0
' a spokesman for the @entity161 added : ' it is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not , in this case			0
' @entity1 is a vital communications post , but residents want a community buyout of the military land the moon will travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over the @entity176 and darkening the skies across @entity92 and across @entity17 in the morning of friday ( 20 march )			1
it is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight			0
the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will start around 8.30am and will last until about 10.45am			2
the further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence @entity189 in the @entity91 of @entity92 is the place to be on this list dr @entity192 , head of the @entity193 said : ' the path of totality lies well to the northwest of the @entity16 making landfall over the @entity198 and @entity199 as totality moves towards the @entity201			0
' the @entity16 will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse			0
' the place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the @entity16 is the west coast of the @entity2 close to @entity1			1
' here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am			0
' skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north - western @entity92 , the @entity91 , @entity213 and @entity214			0
' @entity13 are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old @entity216 - thought to have been an ancient observatory			1
@entity13 president @entity218 said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors			1
' the @entity2 is the best location in the @entity16 for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in @entity214 and the @entity213 isles			1
we are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day , ' he said			0
a team from @entity232 will be broadcasting live from @entity69 too			0
@entity233 , resident astronomer at the @entity234 added : ' it will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn			0
' from the @entity238 upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon			0
' birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge			0
experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer .			0

the west side of the @entity2 set to be the perfect viewing spot
