by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:04 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 10:43 est , 16 january 2014 @entity3 today hit back at claims defence cuts mean @entity5 is no longer a key full military partner to the @entity7			1
the prime minister dismissed the criticism from @entity10 , @entity7 's former defense secretary , insisting @entity5 remains a ' first - class ' military power			1
mr @entity10 said the @entity14 ’s ability to fight on land , sea or in the air has been undermined by moves to slash spending and troop numbers to fill a multi-billion pound blackhole in the defence budget			1
the @entity30 is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 over a number of years , with the 20,000 posts expected to be gone by 2020			0
@entity34 numbers are expected to fall by 6,000 , while the @entity35 will lose 5,000 staff			0
mr @entity10 , who served under presidents @entity37 and @entity39 , told @entity40 's today programme that naval cuts were particularly damaging , noting that for the first time since the @entity44 does not have an operational aircraft carrier			1
he said : ‘ what we have always been able to count upon on this side of the @entity49 was @entity14 forces had full spectrum capabilities very much along the same lines as our own forces that they could perform a variety of different missions			1
former @entity14 defence secretary @entity56 rejected the idea that @entity5 is not pulling its weight ‘ with the fairly substantial reductions in defence spending in @entity5 , what we ’re finding is they wo n’t have full spectrum capabilities and the ability to be able to be a full partner as they have been in the past			1
‘ because i lament our own defence cuts , i would say i also lament that reality in terms of @entity5 , ' he told @entity40 's today programme			1
but mr @entity3 rejected the criticism			0
speaking on a visit to the @entity78 project in central @entity79 , the prime minister said : ' i do n't agree with him			0
i think he has got it wrong			0
' we have the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world			1
we are investing in future capabilities			2
' we are a first - class player in terms of defence and as long as i am @entity89 that is the way it will stay			2
' however mr @entity10 ' concerns echoed those of senior military staff in the @entity14			2
last month general sir @entity95 , the @entity96 , warned that manpower was increasingly seen as an ‘ overhead ’ , and that @entity5 was in danger of being left with hollowed out armed forces , with ‘ exquisite ’ equipment but without the soldiers , sailors and airmen needed to man it			2
he told the @entity107 military think - tank that the @entity34 was ‘ perilously close ’ to its ‘ critical mass ’ in terms of manpower			0
@entity111 , who was defence secretary from 2010 when the coalition was formed until november 2011 , dismissed the idea that mr @entity10 ’ criticism would lead to ‘ hurt pride ’ in the @entity14 military			1
‘ i 've sat beside him in a very large number of meetings over the years and i know him very well , and he 's been a persistent critic , particularly of @entity121 - @entity120 countries who do not pull their weight			2
. who are spending 1 per cent of their gdp on defence			0
‘ the @entity14 need to remember when we did the defence review , we set out the fact that we 'd be able to carry out an enduring stabilisation operation at brigade level - that 's about 6,500 personnel - while conducting a complex non-enduring one of about 2,000 personnel plus a simple one at the same time			0
‘ that is far more than any of our allies in @entity120 outside the @entity7 can do			0
so we 're providing a broad range of capabilities			0
’ @entity141 's shadow defence secretary @entity140 said : ' it should worry @entity3 that @entity5 's strongest ally has concerns about his government 's mishandling of defence			1
' the @entity30 is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly - renamed @entity30 - formerly the @entity30 - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000 mr @entity56 also highlighted that the @entity7 is also cutting its spending on the military			2
‘ the @entity7 is making substantial cuts of about $ 500bn to the @entity152 budget over this decade			2
@entity7 's the world 's biggest economy with the world 's biggest defence budget			1
‘ we 're the world 's eighth biggest economy with the fourth biggest defence budget , so certainly we 're pulling our weight on that and we 're one of only four or five countries inside @entity120 to meet our 2 per cent gdp spend commitment			1
so i do n't think we can be questioned on that			0
‘ countries in the @entity168 who want to be able to spend more on their security need to deal with their economic problems now			0
’ a @entity174 spokesman said : ' like the @entity7 , the @entity14 has had to take tough decisions on defence spending , but we still have the fourth largest defence budget in the world and the best - trained and best - equipped armed forces outside the @entity7			1
' over the next decade , we plan to spend gbp160 billion on equipment , to ensure our armed forces retain their formidable range of cutting - edge capabilities and ability to project power across the globe , including by maintaining our major naval presence in the @entity188			0
' construction of the first new aircraft carrier , the largest ship the @entity34 has ever operated , is almost complete and the @entity34 will also operate state - of - the - art type - 45 destroyers , new type - 26 frigates , and seven new @entity197 class submarines			0

@entity5 does not have ' full spectrum capabilities ' , @entity10 warns
he ' laments ' defence budget cuts on both sides of the @entity49
but @entity205 defence secretary @entity56 insists @entity5 still pulling its weight
