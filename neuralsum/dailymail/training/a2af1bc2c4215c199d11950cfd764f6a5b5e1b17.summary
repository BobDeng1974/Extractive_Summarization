theories about him have abounded online			2
was the creation solely his or was he working for some kind of sinister @entity171 global conspiracy ? @entity27 has been associated with the shadier aspects of the @entity173 and the @entity174			0

he never even divulged if his name was real of a pseudonym			0
@entity242 said working with @entity2 could be difficult			2
' he was the kind of person who , if you made an honest mistake , he might call you an idiot and never speak to you again , ' he said			0
' he does n’t like the system we have today and wanted a different one that would be more equal			0
he did not like the notion of banks and bankers getting wealthy just because they hold the keys , ' @entity242 said			0
over the course of the interview , @entity2 's family described him as ' extremely intelligent , moody and obsessively private , a man of few words who screens his phone calls , anonymizes his emails and , for most of his life , has been preoccupied with the two things for which @entity27 has now become known : money and secrecy			1
' attention : @entity13 's @entity72 spent two months trying to track down the founder of the buzzy ' cryptocurrency ' -- known by the assumed pseudonym ' @entity2 ' neither family nor any colleagues could or would say why @entity2 has remained so secretive about his work — and the millions he has made from @entity27			1
@entity242 speculated that he simply wanted to keep flying under the radar			0
' if you come out as the leader of @entity27 , now you have to make appearances and presentations and comments to the press and that did n’t really fit with @entity2 ’s personality , ' he told the magazine			2

a @entity27 wallet under his name contains 1 million @entity27 — $ 657 million usd at current exchange rates — that have n't been touched since @entity27 's inception			1
@entity13 speculates the reason he has n't spent it is because doing so could have compromised his anonymity			0
another reason is that he does n't want to attract the attention of the @entity340			0
one thing is now clear : if this is the genuine bitcoin inventor , his life might never be the same again now that his true identity has been revealed .			0
