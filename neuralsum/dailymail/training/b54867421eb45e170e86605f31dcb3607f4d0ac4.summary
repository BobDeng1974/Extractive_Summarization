who will ever forget @entity66 , clad in a hideous canary yellow shiny silk suit , proposing to his mysteriously odd @entity69 girlfriend @entity68 infront of the cameras ? how very apt that sequinned - adorned @entity68 was dressed like a confused bird as she strutted through the @entity72 with huge , feathered horns			0
' set the bird free ! ' laughed the stunned celebs looking down from the plush marquees concerned for her welfare on the arm of pensioner @entity66			0
@entity80 up on @entity81 , @entity82 , the blonde bombshell spurned ex of @entity66 , sashayed into the luxury emirates marquee declaring she did n't give a hoot about @entity66 's forthcoming nuptials to @entity68			1

while her famous @entity134 footballer boyfriend @entity133 was celebrating scoring one of the two goals that cemented @entity139 ’s win against @entity140 , @entity142 - @entity141 could n't stop smiling in @entity143 as she enjoyed a day out in the @entity144 despite the distance between the loved - up couple , @entity132 was certainly never far from the beauty ’s mind deck exclusively telling @entity40 she 'd just love for @entity132 to propose			1
@entity150 was a perfect rose amid some rather unpleasant thorns sprawled out , heels missing and dresses torn , teams of security staff had to help them leave @entity125			1
