by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale top football agent @entity1 has slammed the @entity2 for banning him for six months , describing the punishment as ‘ completely out of proportion ’			1
@entity1 , whose @entity5 has been one of the leading football businesses for over two decades , has been banned for two years , with 18 months suspended , for third - party ownership breaches			1
the @entity2 decision prevents him from working during the transfer window this summer , which promises to be highly lucrative with @entity13 clubs expected to spend a record sum			1
not happy : @entity1 has slammed the @entity2 for banning him for six months for a deal involving @entity16 @entity1 worked for @entity17 in negotiating striker @entity16 ’ move to @entity19 for £ 350,000 in 2010 , with the selling club wanting to pay him a proportion of their 25 per cent sell - on arrangement rather than a straight agent ’s commission			1
however the @entity2 vetoed @entity17 ’s proposal			2
but when @entity1 went back to @entity17 after @entity16 ’ £ 6million transfer to @entity28 last august , the club had changed ownership			1
and instead of recompensing @entity1 for his original work , the agent was reported to the @entity2			1
@entity1 said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous that i have been given such a ban when it was @entity17 who wanted to pay me that way			2
i earned nothing for this assistance , @entity17 earned in excess of £ 550,000			0
yet the @entity2 , in their supposed wisdom , felt i acted beyond the agent ’s charter			2
‘ the @entity2 are happy to apply their heavily over-staffed and hugely unsuccessful compliance department to punish those who try to help our game maximise its assets			2
i ’ve been made a scapegoat for the @entity2 failing to nail any proper third - party transactions involving a lot of money			1

. the biggest objections to @entity53 president @entity52 allocating as much as £ 16million of @entity55 ’s money to the film @entity57 , a vanity project about the history of football ’s world ruling body , are expected to come from @entity63			1
and certainly the @entity2 will not be impressed with a film that depicts the colonial pre-war rulers of @entity67 football as arrogant and out of touch ( no change there , then ) for refusing to have anything to do with the @entity72 in 1930 , 1934 and 1938			2

. @entity73 have concerns over the way their chairman @entity76 has been portrayed during the @entity79 sexist text scandal			1
although @entity76 , a shooting pal of @entity79 , chairs the @entity13 ’s audit and remuneration committee , only a majority club vote can rule on their beleaguered chief executive ’s fate			1
yet the misconception demonstrates just why the @entity13 must reform their governance to a far more transparent and independent process			0
watch : @entity79 will be called to account by the @entity2 to deliver his promises @entity52 , who is due to announce his candidacy for a fifth term as @entity53 president at their congress in @entity94 next month , has been widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election			1
former @entity53 executive @entity96 , the only candidate so far , will certainly withdraw when @entity52 becomes a certain runner			0
however , it ’s understood that @entity63 will definitely put up a candidate because their president @entity100 does not want @entity52 to be elected unopposed			2
the @entity101 is unlikely to put himself forward with so much on his plate in @entity63			0
but @entity100 will search for a credible challenger who would n’t be embarrassed by an election defeat			0
no trouble : @entity52 is widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election shame of fans ’ boss the scenes at the end of the @entity112 match against @entity113 will not impress the @entity2 , who had links with their official supporters ’ club team before distancing themselves			1
@entity112 manager @entity118 stormed on to the pitch after the 5 - 5 draw – with @entity113 winning on penalties — to confront the referee , calling him a cheat			0
the official then lunged at @entity118 before players from both sides rushed to keep them apart			0
civil servant @entity118 said : ‘ i was so angry for my players and i had a list of grievances that i wanted to talk to him about			0
i apologised afterwards for what i said			0
’ the @entity2 respect campaign is obviously alive and well .			0

@entity1 has been banned for third - party ownership breaches , but *insists* he is being used as a scapegoat by the @entity2
@entity52 is widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election
