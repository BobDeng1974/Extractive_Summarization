a video recording the comments a woman hears as she walks around the nation 's biggest city is a testament to the pervasiveness of street harassment women face , its creators said wednesday			1
the video , shot over 10 hours one day in neighborhoods all over the borough and edited down to a 2 - minute final product , has set off a storm of outrage since it was released tuesday			2
rape threats have since been directed toward @entity17 , the woman in the video , according to multiple reports			1
the footage , which was shot and edited by @entity47 , was captured by a camera @entity47 had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of @entity17 , who was dressed in jeans and a t - shirt and walked silently along			1
as of this writing , the video has already been viewed 12.3million times and there are over 59,000 comments on @entity59			1
speaking about the experience of making the video , @entity17 told @entity62 ' i felt like crying and i have occurrences in my past of sexual assault , so i was n’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me			1
i was just going over in my head and reliving , unfortunately , these memories while i was walking			2
i wanted to break down in tears			0
' ' i ’m pretty sure i cried that night , ' she also told the newspaper			0
' i put on music			0
i called my mom — i think that was right after the video			2
' i called my mom just so i could hear that she loves me and that i was putting myself forward as a face for this cause because it ’s something i really believe in and i needed to hear that she was proud of me , which she is			0
' hidden camera : the footage was captured by a camera @entity47 had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of @entity17 , who walked silently along stalked : one man walked next to @entity17 for five minutes as she walked through @entity92 @entity93 , executive director of @entity94 ! , the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video , told the @entity97 ' it ’s hitting a nerve			1
certainly , people are coming out of the woodwork and saying some really offensive and misogynist things			0
' we ’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against @entity106 and we ’re pulling those down as quickly as possible , but they exist			1
that ’s scary and i think what they ’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this			0
and both of us are saying no , we need to talk about this because if we do n’t talk about this , if we do n’t get this story out , then none of this is going to change			0
' @entity47 told @entity62 ' i ’m getting some blowback , but not nearly as bad as @entity106			0
right now she ’s getting a lot of threats and things like that and it ’s just so sad			0
it ’s like the video is now being echoed in real life			0
' at no point did @entity17 make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them			1
that did n't stop the comments from coming			0
when she did n't respond , one man told her , ' somebody 's acknowledging you for being beautiful			1
you should say thank you more ! ' everyday : @entity17 said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her stares : at no point did @entity17 make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them - but that did n't stop the comments from coming may told the @entity148 ' this is having a very serious impact on the way we live our lives			1
' @entity17 said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her			1
' the frequency is something alarming , ' she told the wire service			0
@entity161 , walking on a @entity39 street on wednesday , agreed that street harassment is a problem and said it happens to her frequently			0
it 's like an invasion of your space , ' she told the @entity148 ' i 'd like it to stop			0
' the video also has faced some online criticisms , among them that the men shown all seem to be minorities			2
@entity47 and @entity17 emphasized that the comments came from all racial groups , and @entity47 said some interactions that were filmed could n't be used for reasons like the audio was disrupted by passing sirens			2
' my experience , what we documented , it was from everybody , ' @entity17 told the @entity148 another criticism was that some men 's comments seemed innocuous : ' good morning , ' ' have a nice day			1
' some men could have been ' genuinely being nice , @entity191 , a @entity192 resident who readily acknowledged street harassment exists and has seen it happen to women in his family , told the @entity198 said he thought the video shed light on a bigger problem , ' but some people just genuinely want to say hello			2
' that 's the problem with street harassment , may told the wire service , because when there 's a fear that a simple good morning could escalate into sexual comments or actions , there 's a reluctance to engage at all .			1
