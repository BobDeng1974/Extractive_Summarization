soon you wo n't need to rely on @entity1 to reveal whether your friend or lover has been telling untruths			2
an affordable lie detector , named the ‘ @entity6 ’ , is worn on the forehead and changes colour based on the wearer ’s heart rate			1
it first monitors the pulse to establish a baseline , and then compares this to any changes in heart rate - this in turn reveals whether the wearer is panicking about having to conceal the truth			1
crunch time : the ‘ @entity6 ’ is worn on the forehead and changes colour based on heart rate the toy shows green if the person ’s pulse is normal , suggesting that they ’re telling the truth , yellow if they may be lying , and red if the device thinks they are definitely lying			1
created by @entity35 - based toy company , @entity34 , the scanner is supposed to be a cheaper version of a polygraph machine			1
a polygraph works on the assumption that the body reacts involuntarily to the stress of lying			2
it measures reactions such as changes in skin conductance , pulse rate , blood pressure , and breathing while the subject is asked a series of questions			1
truth or dare ? created by @entity35 - based toy company , @entity34 , the scanner is supposed to be a cheaper version of a polygraph machine			1
the device costs £ 28 ( $ 45 ) and comes with a set of 15 questions written out on cards ranging from relationships to secret fantasies lie detectors , used by law enforcement agencies around the world , work on the assumption that parts of a person 's brain will respond involuntarily to certain cues			0
but last year scientists discovered that a significant proportion of people are able to suppress their brain activity that related to remembering , making them appear innocent and helping them to evade detection			0
researchers from the universities of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 alongside the @entity81 devised an experiment where candidates committed a mock crime , after which they were questioned while experts monitored their brain activity			0
their findings have implications for the professionals who rely upon brain activity lie detector tests when questioning criminals			0
@entity91 , @entity92 and the @entity93 use the technique that is based on the assumption that it is impossible to control activity deep in the areas of the brain used for memory			2
the team behind the study said their results show the technique is ' of limited value ' and suggested that investigators using lie detectors in their inquiries should not work on the assumption that a person 's brain activity is completely beyond their control			0
using a number of sensors attached to the body , physiological changes can be used to determine whether someone is telling the truth			2
the @entity6 , however , only monitors changes in pulse using infrared rays			1
the device costs £ 28 ( $ 45 ) and comes with a set of 15 questions written out on cards ranging from relationships to secret fantasies			0
last year , researchers found that a significant proportion of people are able to suppress their brain activity that related to remembering			0
the @entity93 study claimed that this would make them appear innocent due a lie detector test and help them evade detection			0
under pressure : the toy shows green if the person ’s pulse is normal , suggesting that they ’re telling the truth , yellow if they may be lying , and red if the device thinks they are definitely lying			1

*gadget* is worn on the forehead and changes colour based on heart rate
it shows green if the pulse is normal , suggesting they ’re telling the truth
@entity159 is shown if they may be lying , and red if they are ' definitely lying '
scanner , by @entity34 , monitors these changes using infrared rays
