an experimental spaceplane has returned to @entity1 after a successful mission			2
@entity3 launched its unmanned @entity4 ( @entity4 ) on a @entity7 rocket from @entity8 in @entity9 at 1340 gmt today			1
the initial launch was postponed after an unidentified problem with the launch complex			1
in total the flight lasted about 100 minutes , and included a daring re-entry into @entity1 's atmosphere to test new technologies			1
the craft was fired 256 miles ( 412km ) into @entity1 's atmosphere in the first test flight of technology that could lead to new re-usable spacecraft for use on future missions to @entity23			1
scroll down for a replay of the launch the launch of an experimental spaceplane took place , after a minor delay due to an unidentified problem with the launch complex			1
@entity3 launched its unmanned @entity4 ( @entity4 ) on a @entity7 rocket from @entity9 at 1340 gmt today ( still image from live video stream shown ) ' @entity4 has opened a new chapter for @entity3 in terms of reentry capabilities and reusability , ' explained @entity40 , @entity3 director general			1
' @entity3 and its @entity41 , together with @entity44 space industry , are now ready to take up new challenges in several fields of space transportation , in future launchers , robotic exploration or human spaceflight			2
' @entity4 will be launched into a suborbital path by a @entity7 rocket launched from @entity44 ’s @entity53 in @entity54 in february 11			1
@entity4 will separate from @entity7 at an altitude of 210 miles ( 340 km )			1
@entity4 will coast to up to 256 miles ( 412km ) and then begin its re-entry phase , recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors			1
the entry speed of 4.6 miles per second ( 7.5 km / s ) at an altitude of 75 miles ( 120 km ) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit			0
@entity4 will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the @entity74			2
the 16ft ( five metres ) long spaceplane separated from the @entity7 rocket at an altitude of 210 miles ( 340km ) above the @entity1 before climbing to its maximum altitude			1
it then flew @entity81 for around 20,000 miles ( 32,000km ) during the 100 - minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere at a rapid 16,800mph ( 27,000 km / h )			2
during this time it navigated through the atmosphere using ' flaps ' at its back , controlling its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space			0
after passing this test , it then splashed down in the @entity74 as planned around 1525 @entity96 ' this mission will teach us a lot about the technologies we need to apply in new launch systems , in particular when we think about reusable systems , ' said @entity103 , @entity104 of @entity105			0
' this was a short mission with big impact , ' added @entity109 , @entity4 project manager			0
' the cutting - edge technology we validated today , and the data gathered from the sensors aboard @entity4 , will open numerous opportunities for @entity44 to develop ambitious plans in space transportation for a multitude of applications			1
' this photo shows the @entity7 rocket lifting off from @entity3 's base in @entity8 , @entity54 bearing the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) on a 100 - minute test mission the 16ft ( five metres ) long spaceplane separated from the @entity7 ( shown just after launch ) at an altitude of 210 miles ( 340km ) above @entity1 before climbing to its maximum altitude the @entity4 flew @entity81 for around 20,000 miles ( 32,000km ) during the 100 - minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere			1
@entity127 is a map showing its 100 - minute mission engineers at @entity3 hope to use the craft , which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings , to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to @entity1			2
it could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of @entity23 in future missions and then return samples to @entity1			2
're - entry is something we need to achieve if one day we want to have the ambition of having astronauts flying back to @entity1 with @entity44 technologies , ' said mr @entity109			2
@entity4 passed through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new @entity44 re-entry technologies before parachutes deployed to slow the descent for a safe splashdown in the @entity74			1
the @entity156 recovery vessel will be used to retrieve the spacecraft			0
over the last month , the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting @entity4 out of the water			0
the two - piece shell of @entity7 opened to release the space plane at an altitude of about 200 miles ( 320 km )			2
pictured is an artist 's impression of various stage of the test flight developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ( £ 110 million or $ 225 million ) , the @entity4 is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on @entity1 after a mission to space			1
this could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the @entity177 ( @entity177 )			0
the only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the @entity177 and back is @entity180 's @entity179			0
speaking to the @entity181 , mr @entity109 said : ' @entity44 is excellent at going to orbit ; we have all the launchers , for example			0
' we also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit			0
but where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit			0
' so , if we are to close the circle - go to orbit , stay in orbit , come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations			0
' engineers at @entity3 hope to use the craft ( illustration shown ) , which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings , to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to @entity1			2
it could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of @entity23 in future missions and return samples to @entity1 scientists filled the @entity4 with sensors to monitor how the various materials and flight systems cope during the flight			1
after separating from the spacerocket , the @entity4 was travelling at hypersonic speeds of 9,562mph ( 15,389km/h )			0
it climbed further through the atmosphere before lowering and dipping its nose to begin re-entry			0
during the descent , the heat shields designed to protect the spaceplne reached temperatures of up to 1,700 degrees c ( 3,100 degree f ) flaps and thrusters helped control the vehicle as it descended , ensuring it came down at a pre-arranged landing site in the @entity74			2
just before landing a parachute system deployed to allow the two - tonne vehicle to land gently , with airbags deploying to keep it from sinking			0
a recovery ship was waiting nearby - around 1,800 miles ( 2,900km ) west of the coast of the @entity238			0
as it made its way through the atmosphere ( illustration shown ) , @entity4 used ' flaps ' at its back to control its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space , such as @entity250 's recent @entity249 spacecraft			1
after passing this test , it then splashed down in the @entity74 at the end of the flight last year @entity3 used a prototype of the @entity4 to practice recovering it from the ocean			1
an attempt to launch the @entity4 last november was postponed by engineers to allow additional analysis of the rockets trajectory to be conducted			0
last year saw two major setbacks for the space industry			0
on october 28 , an @entity263 rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the @entity177 this was followed three days later by the crash of @entity271 tourist space plane @entity269 on a test flight , killing one of two pilots			0
last year @entity3 used a prototype of the @entity4 to practice recovering it from the ocean , shown in this image the @entity4 spaceplane can be seen above on top of @entity3 's @entity7 rocket on the launch pad in @entity9 the @entity4 space plane as it is encased in its farings that will protect the experimental craft during the launch the graphic above explains the different stages that will occur during the test flight of the @entity4 space plane			1

@entity3 's @entity4 has successfully returned home
the spacecraft took off at 1340 gmt on a @entity7 rocket from @entity9
lift - off was initially delayed after an unidentified launch complex problem
it was carried 210 miles above @entity1 before firing its own thrusters
it climbed to a maximum altitude of 256 miles ( 412km ) and then began its daring re-entry attempt through the atmosphere
it traveled around 20,000 miles before splashing into the @entity74
a ship will recover the spacecraft from the ocean
the @entity4 could lead to @entity44 's first re-entry space vehicle
technology will be used to build re-usable spacecraft for missions to @entity23
