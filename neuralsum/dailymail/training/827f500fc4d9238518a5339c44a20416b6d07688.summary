by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 01:25 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 18:03 est , 29 january 2013 the top executives at several organizations that received taxpayer - funded bailouts also received increasingly generous salaries and bonuses , a watchdog group alleged monday			1
the internal watchdog group , which keeps check on taxpayer bailouts , further noted that the @entity11 failed to curb this spending for the second year running			0
the ceos of three companies that received major bailouts – @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 – each received ‘ excessive ’ pay for the last two years and fought treasury secretary @entity21 to ensure they would receive full pay			1
payout : top executives at firms that received taxpayer bailouts still receive government - approved ' excessive ' compensation , @entity27 said monday , with dozens receiving more than the pre-approved $ 500,000 salary pay day : treasury - approved pay packages of $ 5million or more went to the @entity13 of @entity19 , @entity17 , and @entity18 , the watchdog firm claims the report , which was published by the @entity35 inspector general for the @entity36 ( @entity27 ) , shows that 68 out of 69 executives at the three companies received an annual compensation of at least $ 1million , oftentimes much more			1
and the @entity11 signed off on it , the report claims			0
the report also states that the top 16 executives within @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 received a combined pay of over $ 100 million			1
one of @entity42 ’ goals when it passed the @entity36 program was to curb ‘ excessive ’ executive pay among top managers			2
but the report claims that @entity13 still got heavily compensated , with the @entity11 's so - called ' pay czar ' approving multi-million dollar pay packages			2
the @entity11 's pay czar , or ' special master ’ @entity49 , was tasked with limiting ' excessive ' pay at companies the government bailed out using taxpayer money during the financial crisis			2
but the @entity54 did not follow the rules it had set for compensation , instead letting companies define pay themselves , according to a report by the inspector general for the government 's bailout program			2
heads : @entity64 , general motors chairman and chief executive officer @entity63 , and right , @entity65 , chief executive officer of @entity17 too big to fail ? @entity21 is the @entity66 treasury secretary in 2012 , the pay czar acceded to company requests in approving multi-million dollar pay packages and pay hikes for top executives at @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity19			1
the pay czar approved all 18 pay raises requested by the companies , for a total of $ 6.2 million , and approved pay packages of at least $ 1 million for 68 of the 69 employees at the companies it was overseeing , the report found			1
' while taxpayers struggle to overcome the recent financial crisis and look to the @entity66 government to put a lid on compensation for executives of firms whose missteps nearly crippled the @entity66 financial system , the @entity66 @entity11 continues to allow excessive executive pay , ' the report said			1
ms @entity49 said in the report that it was normal for the top executives at these firms to receive more than the suggested $ 500,000			1
@entity27 fired back : ‘ that might be true if companies had not been bailed out and were not still significantly owned by taxpayers			0
’ special inspector general @entity96 said it was not surprising companies asked for large pay packages and higher pay			0
' but what we saw in 2012 that is somewhat different than prior years is that this time the companies pushed back on pay , but they seemed to have met no resistance , ' she said in an interview with @entity2			0
protesting : @entity108 , an occupy @entity109 member , holds a placard asking @entity18 to stop using @entity66 tax payers bailout money to exploit workers @entity96 is tasked with overseeing the government 's @entity113 or @entity36 , which pumped $ 68 billion into @entity17 , $ 50 billion in @entity18 and $ 17 billion in @entity19 , among others , to save them from collapse during the 2007 - 2009 crisis			1
in december , the @entity11 sold the last of its common stock in @entity17 and said it plans to sell its remaining shares in automaker @entity18 in the next year or so , leaving @entity19 as the last major company that still owes the government under @entity36			1
the acting pay czar , @entity49 , said her office achieved its mission , cutting average cash compensation for the top 25 executives at bailed - out companies from what they were getting prior to the @entity36 bailout			2
in 2011 and 2012 , the office also froze pay for the chief executives of @entity18 , @entity17 , and @entity19			1
' while taxpayers struggle to overcome the recent financial crisis and look to the @entity66 government to put a lid on compensation for executives of firms whose missteps nearly crippled the @entity66 financial system , the @entity66 @entity11 continues to allow excessive executive pay			0
' but last year , @entity96 's office found pressure from financial institutions undermined efforts to limit executive pay at bailed - out companies , especially as some @entity11 officials were more concerned with getting @entity36 funds back than in limiting pay			0
@entity96 said the situation has worsened since then			0
contrary to recommendations the inspector general made last year , the pay czar 's office has not developed procedures for how to decide compensation or when to determine high salaries are warranted			0
' without developing some criteria ... @entity11 put itself in a position of essentially letting the companies drive what pay @entity11 was approving , ' she said			0
under the rules governing pay for @entity36 recipients , cash salaries are supposed to rarely exceed $ 500,000			0
but in 2012 , 70 percent of the top executives at @entity36 recipients overseen by the government had cash salaries of $ 500,000 or more , a number that has quadrupled since 2009 , the report said			1
ninety - four percent got cash compensation of $ 450,000 or more			0
angry : people protest against corporate bailouts in front of @entity17 office during the nationwide ' @entity180 ' protest in @entity181 in 2009 @entity96 said in one situation , the @entity11 approved a pay raise of $ 50,000 for one @entity18 employee because the company wanted to ' do a little extra for him			1
' this shows the complete lack of appreciation that @entity18 has for the fact that they 're owned by taxpayers , and that @entity66 are in tight budgets and do n't have any extra ( funds ) , ' she said			0
in another case , the pay czar approved a $ 200,000 pay raise for an employee of @entity198 , the bankrupt mortgage lending unit of @entity19 , despite knowing the unit was about to go @entity201 said the government 's pay curbs were unlikely to have a lasting impact			2
the report found it likely @entity17 will return to its ' past practices ' in setting high executive compensation now that it has repaid the government 's @entity36 funds			0
' the responsibility shifts to the @entity211 to ensure that @entity17 does not encourage excessive risk taking through compensation , ' the report said .			2
