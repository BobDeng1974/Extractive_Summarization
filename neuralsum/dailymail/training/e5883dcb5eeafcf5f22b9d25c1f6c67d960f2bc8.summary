@entity0 has released the first trailer for its controversial new reality series born in the @entity3 , which follows a group of pregnant women who abandon traditional hospital and home births in favor of having their babies out in the wild , miles away from the nearest medical facility			1
the trailer introduces two mothers who have chosen to pursue this ultimate style of natural birth , with one being carried out into the woods during labor , and another choosing to go through the entire process while camped out in a makeshift cabin in rural @entity20			1
and while the show has come under fire from medical experts who claim it will start a ' dangerous trend ' that will see more mothers attempting to give birth without the help of doctors or midwives , its stars insist their choice of birthing method is actually one of the safest - and most enjoyable			1
' i said , " i do n’t want iv lines , i want to be able to move , be able to walk , i do n’t want to be strapped down to the bed or tied to a monitor			0
" ' the nurses at that time ... were very argumentative and as soon as i proved any resistance to what they wanted to do , they treated me disrespectfully and they introduced a lot of fear to me that was n’t necessary			2
' @entity51 , whose husband @entity67 fully supported her decision to pursue a totally natural birth , is actually a trained midwife and gave birth to her second child while at home , without the help of any other doctors or nurses			0
isolated : @entity51 , from @entity20 , opted to give birth to her third child @entity52 in a makeshift cabin built by her husband trained professional : the 25 - year - old is a midwife and therefore chose not to have any other doctors or nurses present at the birth into the wild : the family asked a nearby medevac team , located 30 minutes away from their home , to be on standby in case of an emergency she admits that giving birth out in the wild , without the safety of a totally - sterile environment , did n't worry her because she completely ' trusted her body ' , her husband and her training to ensure her baby would be born without any complications			0
@entity0 producers offered the @entity101 the opportunity to have a medical professional on - hand in case of any medical emergencies , but @entity51 declined , opting instead to have a ask a medevac team located 30 minutes away from their home to be on standby should anything go wrong			1
' i ’ve attended many births , dealt with many complications			0
we were very prepared , we did n’t anticipate anything going wrong that we could n’t handle , ' she added			0
while announcing the launch of the series back in june , @entity0 's senior vp @entity113 told @entity116 that executives working on the show were taking ' extreme precautions to make sure the mothers and babies were safe ' throughout the filming process			1
mother and child : @entity51 and her husband @entity67 welcomed a healthy baby girl trust : the mother - of - three was completely confident in ' her body and her husband ' he added : ' our presence at these births is going to make them far safer than if they were doing it on their own			0
' but the series has already come under fire from critics who insist that @entity140 in the @entity3 will inspire many more pregnant women to follow in the footsteps of its stars - but without the help and support of a professional production team			1
' i understand everybody wants to believe we over-medicalize pregnancy and that it 's a natural process , ' maternal - fetal specialist @entity148 told @entity116			2
' but it 's a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life			2
