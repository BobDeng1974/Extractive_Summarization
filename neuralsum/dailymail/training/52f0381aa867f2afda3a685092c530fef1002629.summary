a father whose life was saved by a heart transplanted from a keen cyclist awoke to find he had a passion for the sport too			1
@entity6 , 38 , was given weeks to live as he battled a congenital heart condition			1
the businessman did not realise how serious his illness was until medics told him he had kidney failure , lung failure and heart failure			0
despite never having cycled before , he took to the saddle when he left hospital , and now regularly cycles , with @entity19 's name etched into his helmet however , after his successful operation , doctors told mr @entity6 his new heart came from a man named @entity19 – an avid cyclist who was killed in a collision with a car while out riding			1
seven days after his 13 - hour operation he asked physiotherapists to bring an exercise bike into his room and cycled seven minutes every day for a week			0
and , despite never having cycled before , he took to the saddle as soon as he left hospital and is now regularly clocking up the miles – with @entity19 ’s name etched inside his helmet			2
he is also gearing up for a challenging 342 - mile ride from his home near @entity46 to @entity47 – where he had the life - saving transplant – to raise money in @entity19 ’s memory			2
mr @entity6 was born with multiple heart defects , meaning his heart was not effectively pumping blood around his body			1
he was fitted with three pacemakers ( one of which is pictured in an x-ray before his heart transplant ) but suffered a stroke and nearly died in january last year mr @entity6 's condition deteriorated and he was put on the list for a heart transplant			1
he had the operation and says when he woke up and was told his heart was from a cyclist he immediately felt ' stronger '			2
he completed a 30 mile charity cycle ride in @entity19 's memory 19 weeks later mr @entity6 – whose wife @entity67 , 38 , is expecting their third child – said : ‘ before my transplant i had never really cycled			1
but when i found out that my donor had died in a cycling accident i was determined to do it in his memory			2
‘ i have “ @entity19 ” written in my cycling helmet so he ’s with me whenever i ’m on the bike			2
i only know his first name , @entity19 , and when i ’m tired i ask him for a bit extra and it spurs me on			2
’ mr @entity6 – who has two sons @entity83 , six , and @entity84 , nine – had a congenital heart condition and has had a number of major operations since his diagnosis			1
he has had three pacemakers fitted , suffered a stroke and was read his last rites at one point			1
however , he went on to recover and lived as normal a life as possible and even set up his own design and project management business			0
after his heart transplant ( he is pictured in hospital after the procedure ) mr @entity6 now wants to encourage people to sign on to the organ donor list			1
' at some point my donor had made a conscious effort to sign up to the organ register and as a result i am able to keep enjoying my life as well as bring a new one ' he said mr @entity6 , father to sons @entity84 , nine ( left ) and @entity83 , six ( right ) says he owes everything to his heart donor , @entity19			1
he said : ' thanks to him signing on the organ donor list i have a new life , a really active life			0
i have a sense of responsibility to my donor and his family and i 'm never going to waste it ' but his condition deteriorated and in january last year he was admitted to the @entity120 in @entity47 , and placed on the donor register where he awaited a new heart			0
the surgery took place in may last year			0
the hospital is an internationally recognised transplant centre			0
he claimed that as soon as he was told about @entity19 he knew everything was going to be fine			2
he said : ‘ i was keen to find out a bit about my donor			0
the moment i woke up i felt stronger			0
i asked my physio to bring in an exercise bike and i cycled seven minutes a day for the next seven days in memory of my donor			0
my heart wanted to go and go			0
‘ nineteen weeks later i completed a 30 - mile charity cycle in his memory			0
a year later i rode 54 miles from @entity139 to @entity140			0
’ mr @entity6 , from @entity141 , @entity142 , said he owes everything to @entity19			1
he added : ‘ i realised another family have done this for me – another family have enabled my family to carry on			0
’ on why he had taken up cycling , he said : ‘ some people talk about how muscle memory can survive a transplant but i do n’t know about that			2
i put it down to the fact that i wanted to do something in @entity19 ’s memory and , because he was keen on cycling , i chose that			1
’ mr @entity6 ’s wife @entity67 said : ‘ @entity6 ’s transplant has had an unbelievable change			1
we feel like we have been given a second chance at life			0
