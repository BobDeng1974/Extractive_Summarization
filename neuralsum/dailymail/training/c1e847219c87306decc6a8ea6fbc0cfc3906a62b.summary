by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 27 november 2013 the number of ‘ morning - after ’ motorists caught over the drink - drive limit the day after a night out on the tiles is increasing			1
arrests between 6am and 8am for drink - driving following a heavy night rose by nearly 4 per cent last year , according to police figures			2
many motorists do not realise they are still at risk of being over the limit even after hours of sleeping it off			0
a police breathalyser : many people do not realise that they could still be over the legal drink driving limit the morning after a night out and with @entity17 and @entity18 looming – the peak time for morning - after offences , accounting for 10 per cent of the annual total – arrests are likely to soar further			1
a separate survey of 1,688 drivers by insurers @entity22 showed that 3 per cent – or 1.2million – admitted driving while over the legal limit the morning after a drinking session in the past two years			1
some 37 per cent insisted that driving was unavoidable , 26 per cent said they were only going a short distance and 19 per cent thought they were all right to take to the road			0
seven per cent even thought it was acceptable to drive because they were not on a motorway , and 13 per cent believed they were only a little over the limit so it did not matter			0
the report noted that most morning - after drink - drivers still have around five hours to go before they become sober enough to drive			1
arrests between 6am and 8am for drink driving following a heavy night rose by nearly four per cent last year the arrest figures were obtained by @entity22 under a @entity45 request and were based on replies from 22 police forces			2
they show that 350 drivers were arrested for drink - driving between 6am and 8am in 2011 , rising to 363 in 2012 – an increase of 3.7 per cent			2
the @entity22 survey showed that 46 per cent of drivers underestimated how long it took for alcohol to leave the body – or did not know , while 30 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women admitted to having driven at least once after a heavy drinking session the night before			0
the @entity22 report says : ‘ morning - after drink - driving is on the increase , with more motorists putting themselves and other road users at risk			1
' this upward trend is being exacerbated by a lack of awareness among drivers about how long it takes alcohol to leave their system			0
’ the current drink - drive limit is 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood , 35mg per 100ml of breath or 107mg per 100ml of urine			2
this equates to approximately four units for an average man and two to three units for an average woman			0
official guidelines say it takes an hour for the body to break down one unit			1
but experts say that this is not a reliable measure because it will vary depending on the person ’s age , weight , gender and metabolic rate .			0
