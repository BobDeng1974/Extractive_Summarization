@entity0 is determined to be his own man at @entity2 , but this is one habit he will not mind borrowing from sir @entity4			1
late goals were a hallmark of @entity4 ’s teams and how fitting that @entity9 ’s first appearance as @entity2 manager at @entity11 should end with a stoppage - time winner from under - fire midfielder @entity13			1
it meant that the @entity15 maintained his winning start as @entity2 boss , adding @entity18 to a list of beaten opponents that includes @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
subs not used : @entity63 , @entity59 , @entity55 , @entity13 , @entity54 , @entity52 , @entity61 goals : @entity35 49 , @entity13 90 +1 @entity18 : @entity42 ; @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 57 ) , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 90 ) , @entity75 ( @entity76 73 ) ; @entity77 ( @entity78 57 )			1
subs not used : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85			0
goal : @entity71 71 typically , he was still far from happy			1
it was , @entity9 acknowledged , @entity2 ’s ‘ worst game ’ under him			1
they were pedestrian at times and @entity25 missed a penalty			1
on this evidence , he still has a significant amount of work on his hands			0
on saturday lunchtime another team in white will line up against @entity2 ... and this side will have to raise their game to beat @entity102			1
‘ we made a lot of wrong choices , wrong passes and we did n’t press too much , ’ said @entity9 afterwards			0
‘ we have to choose better the right time to pass the ball			0
we have n’t done that and that is a pity			0
‘ it ’s a big pressure because the fans expect a lot , but you can not change everything in three or four weeks and the players can not change either			0
‘ we have to wait and see and develop and we need time , but we have won every game up to now and that ’s fantastic when you see our opponents			2
’ that @entity13 should be the man to score the winner was somewhat poetic			2
warm welcome : @entity0 was given a rousing reception by @entity2 supporters high five : @entity9 ( right ) shares in an embrace with @entity2 mascot @entity128 ( left ) before the game love in : @entity9 has got @entity2 fans excited this season after a dismal last campaign in demand : @entity9 ( right ) signed autographs before he could get to his dugout ahead of the friendly dream team : united fans hope @entity140 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) guide @entity2 to success this season the much - maligned @entity142 might not face such a bleak future under @entity9 as some might think , but last night @entity13 ’s every touch was greeted with ironic cheers from a section of @entity2 fans when he made his first appearance under the new manager as a late substitute			1
however , the jubilant reaction from @entity2 supporters was genuine enough when he scored with the last kick of the game , chesting the ball down and despatching it into an empty net after @entity18 goalkeeper @entity42 had collided with his own defender and completely missed @entity53 ’s high ball into the box			1
if @entity9 can breathe new life into @entity13 ’s @entity11 career , just imagine what he can do for the rest of the team			1
the 63 - year - old might have worked at @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 but he seemed genuinely touched by the reception he received last night			0
‘ fantastic , ’ he said			0
‘ i came on the pitch and they are shouting and screaming my name			0
’ there had been no great fanfare for @entity9 , no banner declaring him ‘ @entity176 ’			0
he does n’t need reminding why he was brought to @entity2			2
@entity4 was n’t even there for the occasion , choosing instead to watch the @entity179 in @entity180			0
top talent : @entity2 had an array of talent watching from the stands at @entity11 on tuesday night @entity186 sensation : @entity56 ( right ) made his @entity11 debut against @entity18 star in the making : @entity61 ( centre ) featured in his first pre-season game since the @entity192 but @entity9 walked out at @entity11 for the first time as @entity2 manager looking every inch a man comfortable in his new surroundings			1
there was a high - five for club mascot @entity200 as his players warmed up and a casual , almost nonchalant , wave of the right hand as he strolled towards a home dugout besieged by photographers before kick - off			0
then he disappeared from view and got on with what he had been brought here to do			0
@entity11 got its first glimpse of the 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation he has implemented since his arrival last month , with @entity56 making his home debut in a deep midfield role			2
the former @entity216 midfielder certainly looked at home against his @entity186 countrymen , instigating a lot of @entity2 ’s best moves			2
he mustered his team ’s first effort on goal in the 23rd minute and it was his pass that released @entity225 down the right in the build - up to the incident that saw @entity25 throw himself rather dramatically to the ground under little contact from @entity65			2
the @entity186 certainly felt justice was done when @entity25 fired the resulting spot - kick against the foot of the post			1
no nonsense : @entity53 ( right ) started for @entity2 at the heart of their defence on the ball : @entity57 also started for @entity0 's side in their last pre-season friendly the @entity242 striker also failed to control a sublime through ball from @entity35 before the @entity245 midfielder gave united the lead four minutes after half - time			1
@entity225 ’s corner was deflected to the edge of the box and @entity35 ’s side - footed finish took a nick off a @entity18 defender on its way over @entity42			1
there was little reaction from @entity9 , who sat scribbling on a notepad			0
defender @entity50 produced a magnificent tackle to deny @entity73 , but the @entity18 ’s @entity258 found an equaliser in the 72nd minute when @entity55 tried to cut out a free kick from the right			2
he was unfortunate to see it deflect over his own defence towards the back post where @entity73 applied an emphatic left - footed finish into the roof of the net			1
step forward @entity13 , the man most closely associated with the doomed @entity269 era			2
late goals never quite fell @entity269 ’ way in his eight months , but here was @entity9 at it in his first game			0
no wonder he was smiling .			0
