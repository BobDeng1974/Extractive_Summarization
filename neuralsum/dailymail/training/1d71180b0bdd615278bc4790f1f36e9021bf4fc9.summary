by @entity0 towns and villages that allow fracking should be given a greater share of the proceeds , a @entity2 mp said yesterday			1
as ministers gave the green light to potential shale gas exploration across vast swathes of the country , mps said support in local areas would depend on the scale of ‘ payback ’ for communities			1
@entity19 , a former ministerial aide in the communities department , which rules on planning applications , said the government ’s current offer was not high enough			0
this amounts to £ 100,000 per exploratory well and 1 per cent of all revenues			0

fracking is likely to be a big issue in next year 's general election fracking is likely to become an important issue in next year ’s general election , with research by @entity40 showing that 31 out of 40 @entity2 target seats could be open to shale gas exploration			1
it could also affect 24 of 31 cabinet ministers ’ constituencies			0
parts of mr @entity19 ’s constituency of @entity48 and @entity49 are in the @entity50 , a region stretching from @entity51 to @entity52 said to contain 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas – enough to cover @entity55 ’s energy needs for decades			1
he backed new rules designed to protect national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from development , but said ‘ there are other issues still to be sorted ’			0
one of these was protection of the water table , which some critics have claimed can be contaminated by fracking			1
the process involves pumping a mixture of sand , water and chemicals into shale deposits to force out gas trapped in them			2
mr @entity19 said many of his constituents did not have a mains water supply and drew directly from the water table			1
‘ it ’s a serious [ election issue ] in terms of getting it right , and also in terms of what is the payback for @entity84 , ’ he added			2
‘ we still believe there should be a greater payback to local areas			0
’ in addition to the £ 100,000 per well and 1 per cent of revenues , ministers have agreed to let councils keep all the money paid in business rates by fracking firms that otherwise would have gone to the exchequer			2
it is thought councils could be in line for up to £ 1.7million a year for a typical 12 - well site			2

there has been serious opposition to fracking in @entity55 , partly from fears the process could contaminate underground water supplies campaigners have welcomed the rules restricting development in areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks , where major fracking projects will be allowed only in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1
@entity121 , of the @entity122 , said : ‘ this is a significant change			0
we hope it will reflect a much more cautious approach that recognises the risks of turning some of the most special places in the country over to industrial - scale extraction of shale gas and oil			1
’ however , @entity40 said the rules were a ‘ sham ’ that would create a ‘ giant loophole ’ for fracking across protected areas			0
spokesman @entity136 said : ‘ ministers ca n’t have their cake and eat it			0
if they ’re serious about protecting our national parks , they should have made them off limits to shale drillers			0
’ industry sources said there was concern that the new rules could act as a barrier to the extraction of shale gas .			1

fracking is likely to become a big issue in next year 's general election
three - *quarters* of @entity2 target seats could be open to shale gas exploration
there are fears that exploitation could contaminate the water table
