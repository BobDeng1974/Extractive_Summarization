by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 19:29 est , 12 june 2012 garden feud : @entity3 , 74 , destroyed her neighbours ' trees and shrubs during a six year battle over who owned a path , a court heard the greenery hanging over a path at the bottom of her neighbours ’ garden made @entity3 see red			1
so the 74 - year - old , who claimed the 3ft - wide strip of land was part of her property , decided on direct action			1
she went on a three - month hacking spree with an electric saw and shears , chopping down plants in the middle of the night and hacking at an apple tree			1
after trying to persuade @entity3 to stop , her long - suffering neighbours , @entity30 and @entity31 , reported her to police to protect what they believed was their property			1
yesterday , @entity3 was ordered to end to her campaign after a judge backed the cooks and placed her under an indefinite restraining order			1
the feud began after the pensioner insisted the path at the bottom of the @entity36 ’ garden was actually part of her land , which adjoins it			1
she claimed to have pruned trees and shrubs there long before 2004 , when the @entity36 moved next door to her bungalow in @entity52 , @entity53			0
however , they maintained that the path was theirs and politely asked her to stop pruning and mutilating their plants and trees			2
instead , her raids on their foliage escalated			0
in all , she made more than 12 attacks on their property between august and november last year , at one point even hacking down bamboo at 4am			1
@entity64 heard she also installed @entity66 cameras overlooking the path			1
the @entity36 claimed she shouted at them and deliberately played loud music while they were outside to spoil their enjoyment of the garden			2
@entity3 said she was legally entitled to cut the shrubs and trees because they were encroaching on the path , which she said was hers			1
damage : tree branches which @entity74 cut off during her campaign of harassment against the @entity31 family but the @entity36 showed the court @entity79 documents that confirmed the path was theirs			2
they told how she had damaged several plants as well as a fence			0
mr @entity84 told the court : ‘ i went through every kind of emotion			0
‘ i was angry , upset , i was hurt			0
i could n’t believe anyone was acting in that way			0
’ wrecked : a tree which has been attacked by a chainsaw in @entity30 and @entity31 's garden mrs @entity31 added : ‘ she was very aggressive			2
she would never listen to us			0
‘ we wanted to find a resolution to the problem , to find out why she continued to come into our garden and destroy it , and find a situation where we could all live peacefully without interference			2
‘ we would like her to leave us alone			0
we would like to live our lives privately , with a private garden			0
‘ we want to go into our gardens without fear of being shouted at , or spied on , or to have music played loudly , without being watched , just as any other people would do			0
’ @entity3 claimed she had a letter from 2007 proving her ownership of the path , but she was unable to produce it in court			1
speaking of the @entity36 , she said : ‘ i did always prune the silver birch			0
when they came here it was a different ball game			0
i was told to get off it [ the path ]			0
i do n’t want to talk to them			0
‘ i told them i ’m loath to have anything to do with them			0
’ @entity3 denied one charge of harassment but was found guilty by district judge @entity123			2
she was given a restraining order preventing her from going in her neighbours ’ garden or having contact with them			1
@entity3 was also ordered to remove the cctv and was told to pay £ 500 court costs			2
garden wars : @entity30 and @entity31 lived in the property in @entity52 , @entity53 , which is marked in blue while @entity3 , 74 , lives in the bungalow marked red			1
the path leads to a private road round the back of @entity3 's property - which is the left - hand side of this aerial image feud : the property in @entity52 , @entity53 , where @entity31 and @entity84 live			1
they proved that they were the owners of the garden path			1

@entity3 , 74 , went on a three - month wrecking spree - and even hacked down bamboo at 4am
pensioner installed @entity66 camera overlooking the *disputed* garden path
she has been given a restraining order preventing her from using the garden
