first minister @entity14 visits @entity22 in @entity16 , where he played a game of bowls with @entity26 gold medalist @entity25 and sport minister @entity27 mr @entity14 celebrated his first attempt at bowling - but it later emerged that he had been practising beforehand he has persisted with the argument despite claims of hypocrisy after it emerged the @entity35 ’s own spending on private contractors rose by almost a quarter last year to more than £ 80million			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ health is a devolved issue			2
so the only person who could , if they wanted to , introduce more private provision into the @entity6 in @entity13 is @entity14			1
‘ i think this is a desperate man recognising the argument is going away from him making a pretty desperate argument			0
‘ actually because of the protection on @entity6 spending that the @entity47 has given that we would not cut @entity6 spending while we have had to make difficult decisions elsewhere - that has actually made sure under the @entity52 formula that money is available for @entity13 as well			1
