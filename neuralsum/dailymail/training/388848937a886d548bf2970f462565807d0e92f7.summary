by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 10:52 est , 28 august 2012 twelve @entity2 police officers have been detained on suspicion of deliberately opening fire on an armoured car and wounding two @entity6 embassy employees			1
the incident has put a strain on @entity6 / @entity2 relations and turned the spotlight back on serious problems inside @entity2 's premier law - enforcement agency			2
officials offered sketchy accounts of the shooting that do not address the reason @entity2 federal police opened fire on friday on the vehicle , which had diplomatic licence plates and was carrying a @entity2 @entity21 captain			1
that charge can entail both criminal wrongdoing and extreme negligence			1
it leaves open the possibility of both a deliberate attack on @entity6 by corrupt officers and a gross error			2
experts said either scenario was cause for pessimism about the federal police , which has long been touted as the best hope for @entity2 controlling organised crime			1
@entity54 , director of the security consulting firm @entity55 , said : ' we 're looking at another example of why there 's significant concern over how @entity2 has gone about training its federal police			1
' @entity2 municipal and state police are seen as widely corrupt , incompetent or both			1
military troops have been accused of an increasing number of human rights violations since president @entity66 sent them into the streets in late 2006			0
law enforcement problems : two @entity6 embassy officials were injured in the incident , which has put a strain on @entity6 / @entity2 relations @entity2 's government has made a major effort in recent years to retrain the federal police , purge its ranks of corrupt officers and increase its numbers from 6,000 to more than 35,000 officers			1
dr @entity79 , an expert on @entity2 's effort to combat drug cartels , said : ' they have been pushed to do a lot in a very short time and they are recruiting a lot of young people and they try to push them through the training process very quickly to use new equipment , and to handle new intelligence and to handle operations that are probably better handled by well - seasoned veterans			2
' the reputation of the federal police was damaged in june after two officers fatally shot three colleagues at @entity33 's international airport			2
authorities said the shooters were part of a trafficking ring that flew in cocaine from @entity104			0
@entity2 announced this month that it was replacing 348 federal police assigned to security details at the airport in an effort to quash drug trafficking through the terminal			1
last year , a businessman from @entity112 , across the border from @entity114 , @entity115 , accused a group of 10 federal police officers of beating him , torturing him and driving him around town			1
protesters : relatives of the federal policemen involved in shooting at a @entity6 embassy vehicle try to block the exit of a van carrying the officers to a federal detention centre in @entity31 , @entity2 they released him when he said he would give them money , but instead @entity131 went to authorities and the agents were detained			1
in april , @entity134 was stabbed to death inside his home , which was then set on fire			0
his death came a day before he was to attend a judicial hearing to ratify his accusation against the officers			0
in the case involving the embassy vehicle , @entity6 and @entity2 officials declined requests for comment yesterday			2
supporters of the detained police gathered outside prosecutors ' offices in @entity31 , just south of @entity33 , to protest			0
the @entity6 @entity27 in @entity33 said that two @entity6 government employees and a @entity2 @entity21 captain were heading to a training facility outside the city of @entity31 when they were ambushed by a group of gunmen that included federal police			2
the @entity2 government said federal police were conducting law - enforcement activities in the rural , mountainous area known for criminal activity when they met the car , which attempted to flee and came under fire from gunmen in four vehicles			1
violence : the bullet - ridden car is checked by military personnel before federal officers were detained to get to the bottom of what happened neither country has offered further details , but experts said the incident would almost certainly affect the thinking of president - elect @entity178 , who has promised to both double the ranks of the current federal police and start a new paramilitary force known as the gendarmerie , composed of former military members operating under civilian command			1
observers have predicted that the creation of the new force will increase tensions between the many agencies currently responsible for law - enforcement and public security in @entity2			0
since 2008 , the @entity6 government has given $ 243million in equipment and $ 25million in technical assistance and training to the federal police under the drug - war aid program known as the @entity198			0
under @entity200 , more than 4,300 federal police have completed training at @entity2 's @entity202 in @entity203			2

congressman @entity214 , a @entity115 @entity215 closely involved in @entity6 / @entity2 - relations , urged @entity6 taxpayers to be patient with the development of @entity2 law enforcement			0
' we 're seeing that in @entity221 , @entity222 , the training part of it does take a while , ' he said			0
' i am optimistic that @entity2 want to have a peaceful existence where they 're free of drug violence			0
we need to have a long - term commitment and we need to understand it 's going to be years			0
' video : investigation underway - see the bullet riddled car staff were riding in ...			0
