@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has given his unequivocal backing to @entity3 ahead of a potentially career - defining year for the @entity5 head coach			1
@entity3 will take his troops to the @entity7 in two weeks ' time to begin the pursuit of a first @entity10 crown since he took over in 2012			1
@entity11 will then turn to a @entity12 on home soil in the autumn where @entity5 must finish in the top two of a group featuring both @entity17 and @entity18 to make the quarter finals			1
@entity5 coach @entity3 has been given full support by @entity1 chief executive @entity0 @entity0 has praised the @entity5 coach for the ' bigger role ' he plays beyond just training the team @entity0 admits the pressure will be on @entity26 to get to the latter stages of the tournament but he is confident the right man is in charge to lead the team forward			1
' the number one objective is coaching the team - absolutely his focus in terms of 2015 , ' he told the @entity37			2
' but again i think he 's got that bigger role			2
he 's also got a role about engagement with the public , engagement with the game as a whole			2
' you 've heard me talk about inter-connection			2
if you want to engage the country you have to have someone who deals with that			0
' and he gets , i hope - and i think he believes this - a lot of support internally , because yeah , of course he 's under some pressure			0
' @entity3 , with @entity55 ( left ) and @entity56 , has not won the @entity10 since taking charge in 2012 @entity5 face a bumper year that includes the @entity10 and the @entity12 on home soil if all goes well at the @entity12 then @entity26 is likely to also lead @entity5 into the 2019 edition after signing a deal in october which ties him to the @entity1 until 2020			1
the awarding of a six - year contract the year before a @entity12 raised a few eyebrows but @entity0 insists he has even more faith in @entity26 now than he did the day the coach was appointed			1
' we had a great advisory panel			0
i was sat there at the first meeting with @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , ' he said			0
@entity77 ( centre ) has been called up into @entity5 's @entity10 training squad ' they were a great bunch of people to help			1
you had to start with this old - fashioned idea ; this is what we want , how does he ( the candidate ) fit against it ? how does he measure up ? ' three years on , that view has been even more informed , because i spend a lot of time with him and the coaching staff			0
not only does @entity3 have that understanding and appreciation , but it 's palpably clear that this is a guy who has values			1
' we could all say , ' yes , but it 's all about winning '			0
of course it 's all about winning			0
but it 's also about values , and you have to say they are doing a really good job			0

@entity5 are involved in the @entity10 and @entity12 at home in 2015
@entity1 chief @entity0 has total faith in @entity3
@entity5 coach has signed a deal with the @entity1 that extends until 2020
