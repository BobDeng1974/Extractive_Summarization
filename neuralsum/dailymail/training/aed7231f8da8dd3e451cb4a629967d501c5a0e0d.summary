by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 21 october 2013 @entity3 fans reacted with sadness and fury when it was revealed that the beloved character mr @entity3 had been killed off in @entity8 's latest novel , @entity9			1
now the author has revealed why she felt her heroine had to find herself suddenly single again at the age of 51 with two children			0
she explains in a video you can watch below : ' i wrote this book from the inside out , that is what happened , @entity14 died			0
no - one gets to @entity3 's age without suffering some sort of loss , life does n't turn out as you expect			1
' i did n't want this book to be a weak copy of the other books , ' she said			1
and despite the sad subject matter of @entity3 becoming a widow , @entity45 said the book is still funny and uplifting			1
@entity49 is back : @entity45 said she kept the character played by @entity52 , right , because ' an ex can become a friend ' ' the thing about @entity3 is the comedy has always come from something real , ' she explained			1
' tough things happen in life and she gets through and she survives , she had her friends , she deals with it and she comes through the other side and she 's still finding things funny			0
' it hurts but she 's still laughing , that was something important that i wanted to say			0
' but while mr @entity3 - who was played by @entity33 - in the films will only be referred to in flashbacks in the new book , @entity45 was keen to ensure the character @entity70 still had a starring role			1
he was the lovable rogue who cheated on @entity3 and almost cost her her happy relationship with @entity3			2
so it is plausible they would still be friends decades later ? @entity45 believes so			0
' the thing about @entity49 is , people do stay in people 's lives , old boyfriends do become friends			0
not all sad : @entity45 said the new novel still has humour despite the loss of @entity3 's husband still mad about @entity3 : the book has been selling well despite poor reviews ' he 's still @entity49 saying " what colour are your panties " and having a crack at seduction but he 's still in her life and they accept each other as they are			1
' @entity45 concedes his inclusion is also because she has a soft spot for the character - which was increased after @entity52 played him so charmingly in the film adaptations , adding his own improvised lines to the script			2
she said : ' i love @entity49 as a character and i love @entity52 as a character			2
@entity52 contributed a huge amount to the funny lines in the movie			0
' for example when he 's seducing @entity3 and she 's wearing the big pants , and he says " do n't worry , i 'm wearing something similar myself " and " oh mummy ! " that came from him			1
' so i really wanted to keep him present and he 's now godfather to @entity3 's children			2
' despite some mediocre reviews and the loss of mr @entity122 has still been snapped up by readers , topping the hardback chart the week it went on sale .			0

fans saddened by loss of hero in latest @entity3 novel
author @entity8 said it makes it more realistic
she did n't want third book to be ' weak copy ' of previous two
@entity70 remains because she loves the character and @entity52 's *portrayal*
