by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 12:40 est , 23 january 2014 a plant virus has been found in honeybees and could help explain their decline			1
@entity6 and @entity8 scientists have found the tobacco ringspot pathogen , which attacks tobacco plants and soybeans , is increasingly prevalent in declining honeybee colonies			1
they say it is the first evidence that honeybees exposed to infected pollen can become infected too			1
@entity6 and @entity8 scientists have found the tobacco ringspot pathogen , which attacks tobacco plants and soybeans , is increasingly prevalent in declining honeybee colonies ( pictured ) the use of pesticides , loss of habitat and climate change has previously been blamed for the shrinking of honeybee populations			1
‘ the results of our study provide the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus - contaminated pollen can also be infected and that the infection becomes widespread in their bodies , ’ the study 's lead author , @entity26 of the @entity28 , said			1
the virus was also found in varroa mites – a beehive pest described as a ‘ vampire parasite ’ that is also believed to weaken colonies by transmitting disease while feeding on their blood			2
the researchers made their discovery after screening bees for frequent and rare viruses			2
@entity48 ( illustrated ) is not the only virus now known to attack honeybee colonies but it is the first evidence that honeybees exposed to infected pollen can become infected too around five per cent of known plant viruses are pollen - transmitted and are therefore potential sources of host - jumping viruses , they explained in their paper , which was published in the journal @entity58			1
these viruses tend to be particularly dangerous because they lack a genetic function that edits out errors in replicated genomes so that they can generate a flood of variant copies with different infective properties			0
high replication rates mean viruses appear to work together to determine the suffering of their hosts			0
‘ the viruses are a likely source of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases , ’ the researchers said			0
the virus was also found in @entity77 mites - a beehive pest described as a ' vampire parasite ' that is also believed to weaken colonies by transmitting disease while feeding on their blood			2
this mite has been magnified many times and is clinging to hairs on a bees 's leg @entity48 ( @entity90 ) is not the only virus now known to attack honeybee colonies			1
when the researchers investigated bee colonies classified as strong or weak , @entity90 and other viruses were more common in the weak colonies than they were in the strong ones			2
they said that bee populations with high levels of multiple viral infections began failing in late autumn and perished before february			2
in contrast , those in colonies with fewer viral assaults survived the entire cold winter months			0
‘ the increasing prevalence of @entity90 in conjunction with other bee viruses is associated with a gradual decline of host populations and supports the view that viral infections have a significant negative impact on colony survival , ’ the researchers said			0
honeybee populations are declining sharply there are only enough honeybees in @entity118 to properly pollinate a quarter of the country ’s crops , scientists claim			1
destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees , which are vital for food production			0
professor @entity130 of the @entity131 , who led the research project , said : ‘ we face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity137 , found that @entity138 has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops			1
bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides			0
previous studies have estimated that the number of @entity118 honeybees have halved over the last 25 years			0
scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination .			0

@entity6 and @entity8 scientists have found the tobacco ringspot virus is increasingly prevalent in declining honeybee colonies
it attacks tobacco plants and can be passed to bees via infected pollen
pesticides , loss of habitat and climate change have previously been blamed for the shrinking of honeybee populations
