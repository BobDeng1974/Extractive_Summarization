by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 07:13 est , 14 september 2012 for almost two decades , film buffs have been playing ' @entity2 of @entity2 '			1
similar to the idea that we can form a chain to anyone else on the planet through seven degrees of seperation , the game starts with someone naming an actor , and challenging their friends to find a connection to @entity2 in as few links as possible			1
now @entity15 - well known for sneaking ' easter eggs ' into its search engine - has , at long last , brought the ' @entity2 ' directly into its results pages , making the game a lot more visible - but perhaps upsetting film fans who prefer a challenge over instant gratification			1
but kudos to any fan who can get to from @entity27 's @entity26 to @entity2 in just four moves			2
from @entity29 to @entity2 : the chain passes from @entity26 , to actress @entity31 through co-star @entity32 , to @entity33 due to a shared appearance in ' @entity35 ' , to @entity2 in @entity36 the game was borne out of a statement the actor made in 1994 , when he said he has worked with everyone in @entity41 , or knew someone who had worked with them			1
@entity2 is perhaps best known for his roles in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and is one of @entity41 's most prolific actors			1
with over 50 @entity41 films under his belt , you can quickly get to any notable actor , director or crewmen by filling in the blanks - and then the fun is in getting to his name in as few as links as possible			0
for example : @entity62 , famed for @entity63 and @entity64 , was in @entity65 with @entity66 , who was in @entity45 with @entity2			0
the @entity2 : typing an actor 's name followed by ' bacon number ' gives you a @entity41 countdown to the @entity47 star centre of the universe ? almost every actor can be linked to @entity2 , usually within two or three people - for example @entity62 , from @entity64 , can make it in two links when the game started - and began spreading over the internet as various fan - sites built up at the end of the 90s , it was quite difficult to get to the actor within a few links			2
but , 20 years down the line , with actors adding to their cv and building more connections , it is now surprisingly difficult to find actors with more than three or four degrees of separation from @entity2			2
indeed , even the @entity27 and @entity95 cast are only three or four links away from the actor			0
one for the @entity27 fans : @entity98 , best known to us as @entity29 , is only four degrees of separation from @entity2 ... and , to be soap agnostic : @entity95 fans can enjoy the fact that @entity103 is only three steps from @entity41 's centre @entity15 has yet to comment on the reasons for the new search engine trick			1
but the search engine has a history of sneaking pranks into search results - if you want just one example , search ' tilt ' on @entity15 right now			0
or type recursion - and then get annoyed as you get lost in a cycle of ' did you mean ... @entity118 ? ' if you want to give it a go , type an actor 's name before the @entity2 below			0
( @entity123 will open in a new window )			0

@entity15 gets in on the fun of game which challenges film buffs to link actors to @entity2 based on films of co-stars
