by @entity0 last updated at 5:18 pm on 20th january 2012 a father who was so fat he used to drive his car almost horizontal so he could fit behind the wheel has lost nearly half his body weight			1
@entity5 , who weighed more than 41 stone , used to gorge on pork pie sandwiches every night as well as packets of biscuits and takeaways			1
but when he eventually broke the seat of his car , his sisters confronted @entity5 and persuaded him to stop eating himself to death			1
@entity5 , who used to stuff himself with pork pie sandwiches has has lost 16 stone ( and hopes to lose a few more ) before going on a diet , the 39 - year - old was too ashamed to leave the house and could n't walk anywhere without becoming breathless			1
now - after shedding 16 stone , the weight of a baby elephant - @entity5 , from @entity22 says he no longer recognises himself			1
he said : ' if you had seen me two years ago to what i am now , you would think i was two different people			1
' i used to drive almost lying down just so my belly could fit behind the wheel			1
nobody could fit behind me either			1
' the day the seat broke was pretty bad , although i can laugh about it now			2
' @entity32 , who is dad to 15 - year - old @entity33 , admits he ' has always been big ' but says that his weight spiralled after he lost his job as a call centre trainer in 2005			2
with nothing to do , @entity32 would sleep from 6am until 2pm , skip breakfast and lunch before devouring a takeaway at around 9pm with half a loaf of bread on the side			2
he said : ' i was really lazy			2
my mam would try and give me recipes but i just could n't be bothered with it			2
it was so much easier to phone up for a takeaway			2
' as @entity5 began to pile on the pounds he became reclusive , too scared to even go into his garden after a group of boys taunted him about his size			1
very happy family : @entity5 pictured with hi sisters @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 who persuaded him to loose weight he said : ' it was like a spiral , your confidence is knocked , you 're not going out as much and you just find yourself comfort eating			1
' anytime my friends would call or ask me to go out , i 'd say i was busy and make excuses			2
' i used to have a lot of friends but i cut them out because of the way i felt about myself			2
' the only time @entity5 would venture outside was to drive his grandmother - who has asthma and a knee replacement - to the shops or to pick up his 15 - year - old son @entity33 from school			1
he said : ' crowds used to really scare me			2
and when i picked my son up he used to ask me to stay in the car			0
' it could have just been that age where it is not cool for your dad to come for you , but then i always thought he might be embarrassed about my weight too			0
' one day his sister @entity58 persuaded him to go for a walk , but @entity5 said : ' i got out the car and i must have walked for 50ft when i had to stop because my knees and my back were hurting so much			1
' despite the warning signs @entity5 did n't face the facts until his sisters , @entity57 and @entity58 , staged an intervention			1
they contacted their brother 's doctor who sent over a crisis team of nurses			0
@entity58 said : ' we talked for months about what we could do because we were worried sick about him			0
our nana used to cry herself to sleep thinking she 'd find him dead			0
' @entity57 said : ' we did not want to invade his privacy but in the end we had to because if anything happened to him we would always be thinking " why did n't we do anything " ? ' at the time i felt bad but it was the best thing we have ever done			0
' although @entity5 had a panic attack when the nursing team arrived , he agreed to visit his gp			1
he said : ' he gave me three choices : i could die , i could have a gastric band or i could try to lose weight myself			0
' the gastric band was not an option as both my dad and grandad had died in hospital and i was scared of surgery			0
' so @entity5 plucked up the courage to join his local @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity22			1
he was delighted to lose a stone in the first month and continued to lose a stone a month			0
he said : ' one of the scariest things i have ever done was walk through that door at @entity125			0
' it seemed like there were about 1,000 people there and as i opened the door everyone looked			0
it 's been a breeze since then ! ' now slimmed down to a more healthy 25 stone , @entity5 has a new lease of life			1
he 's swapped the pork pie sandwiches for fruit throughout the day and has home - cooked pasta , curry or chilli in the evening			0
now no longer housebound , @entity5 loves walking everywhere			1
last year he was able to take @entity33 for a birthday weekend in @entity150 for the first time since 2006			0
he said : ' before i had heard about things being built but was stuck in the house so i never saw them			1
i thought " i live in this area but i do not know it anymore "			0
' so i took up photography and i go all over the place taking photographs			0
' the super-slimmer says he still wants to lose another six stone but is n't worried about suffering from loose skin			0
he said : ' at 6ft 4ins the doctor said i should be just over 14st 2lbs			0
but i do n't think i would look right so i 'd be happy at just under 20 stone			0
' my attitude might change when i have lost more weight but for now i am happy to tuck any loose skin into my pants ! '			0

@entity5 became too ashamed to leave his house because of his size
