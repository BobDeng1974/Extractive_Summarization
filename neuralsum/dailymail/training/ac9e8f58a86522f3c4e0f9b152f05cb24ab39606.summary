by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:25 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 28 december 2012 jumping into the sea on a chilly @entity3 was always going to hurt			1
but these unlucky swimmers found the experience extra painful after they were swept on to rocks			1
the choppy waters braved in yesterday ’s annual dip meant many emerged from the sea dripping with blood			1
cuts and bruises : the injured swimmers hobble over the rocks to shore , helped by lifeguards and bystanders danger : a man is wrenched from the stormy sea after the situation began to look worrying @entity24 crews and bystanders rushed to help injured participants , some of whom were in fancy dress , at the afternoon swim in @entity31 , @entity32			1
many of the 370 swimmers , who were raising money for their local branch of the @entity37 , emerged shivering and wounded after the 11am start			1
@entity40 , who watched the swim , said : ‘ it is a classic @entity3 event in @entity31 and everyone enjoys taking part , but this year the conditions were n’t great			1
‘ it was quite choppy			1
some of the swimmers were swept towards the rocks			2
‘ the barnacle - covered rocks meant the swimmers in difficulty were well covered by grazes			2
the @entity56 members on the beach went to help			2
’ poor weather for swimming : heavy rain throughout december has caused havoc across @entity62 up until five years ago only a few dozen took part in the @entity31 event , but the number has since increased tenfold			2
organiser @entity67 said : ‘ a few people had a few scrapes but there were no serious injuries			2
it went well given the weather , with some having a paddle and others enjoying a swim			0
’ the @entity3 swim , which started in @entity31 in 1985 , is one of numerous similar events held across the country			0
seen by some as a bracing and effective way to freshen up after a day spent eating and drinking to excess , it is viewed by others as a foolish and uncomfortable exercise			0
a swim across the @entity89 in @entity90 was called off after the @entity91 said the river was dangerously flooded			0
it was flowing so fast that the safety boats would not be able to manoeuvre if any of the swimmers got into trouble			0
unhappy ending : the fun - loving fundraisers clambered out of the water with the help of a lifeboat and a few dedicated @entity3 lifeguards @entity102 : the swimmers were relieved to be back on dry land after what could have been a very nasty @entity3 surprise a @entity108 swim in @entity109 was also called off after the local council closed the beach because of bad weather			0
@entity109 and @entity113 said conditions would be ‘ extremely dangerous ’ for even experienced swimmers , with winds of up to 30mph , a high tide and a heavy sea swell forecast			0
along the south coast , a woman died when a wave knocked her off her feet as she paddled off @entity124 beach in @entity125			0
three witnesses tried in vain to rescue her and she was washed a short distance out to sea before being recovered by a lifeboat crew			1
she had been with a small group of bathers who decided to brave the sea on christmas morning despite dangerous conditions			1
with winds gusting up to 50mph , the coastguard said conditions were ‘ not suitable for swimming or small craft ’ when the incident happened at 10.40am			0
he said the woman suffered head injuries when she was washed into a groyne , a barrier made of concrete , steel and timber leading from the beach to the sea which is designed to reduce erosion .			0

@entity24 crews rushed to help injured participants
bystanders also came to rescue of those *stranded* from group of 370
