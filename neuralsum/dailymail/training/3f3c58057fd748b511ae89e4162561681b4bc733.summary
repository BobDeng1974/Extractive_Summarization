@entity0 made it four pole positions in five races this season as he again left @entity6 team - mate @entity5 trailing			1
with @entity6 again proving to be way ahead of their rivals , @entity0 finished 0.168 seconds ahead of @entity5 as the all - conquering force in @entity9 again locked out the front row of the @entity13 @entity12 grid			1
as long as he keeps his nose clean , @entity0 is likely to win sunday ’s race after a brilliant performance in qualifying			1
nobody can live with them : @entity44 , of @entity45 , was third fastest , a full second back from @entity47			1
‘ i ’m very disappointed , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ i do n’t particularly like coming second to @entity0			2
i did a good lap but he did a better job			0
’ there is a danger , implicit in what @entity5 said , that @entity0 can waltz to his second world title			1
he has won three of the four races , the only blip being a technical malfunction at the opening round in @entity59			0
close : @entity5 finished just behind @entity0 as @entity6 locked up the front row @entity5 won that race and was runner - up at the next three , meaning that he takes a four - point lead into today ’s race in @entity20			1
@entity0 has not led the standings since he did so fleetingly in 2012			2
‘ that was my one small taste of leading the championship for some time , but otherwise i do n’t remember the last time , ’ he said			0
‘ as long as you ’re leading when you cross the finish line at the last race , that ’s what counts			0
but it ’s my goal to get in front and stay there			0
’ @entity0 accomplished his pole position feat despite having problems with his machinery			1
he came on the radio to say : ‘ i do n’t know how but we ’ve made the car worse			0
’ impressive : @entity45 driver @entity44 completed the top three in @entity83 disappointing : @entity84 failed to set a time in @entity85 at @entity20 after stopping on track he later explained : ‘ in practice we had such a great car and often when things are that good you do n’t want to change much			1
but we changed a few things over night in the hope of making things a little bit better – small things , like half a millimetre here and there			0
‘ but today they car was a real handful			0
’ the same could be said of the world champion , @entity84			2
the gearbox of his @entity45 failed , condemning him to start 10th and adding to a season of woe			0
how he must be irked by the performances of his team - mate @entity44			1
‘ i 'm quite disappointed , ’ said @entity84			2
it was a dismal day , too , for @entity111			2
@entity112 was eighth fastest – impressive in the circumstances – and his rookie team - mate @entity114 15th			1
the feel - good factor that came with @entity118 ’s return is dissipating			0
it will take time for the structural changes that are slowly evolving to take full effect .			0

@entity6 ace @entity0 secured his fourth pole in five races in 2014
the @entity127 was *0.168secs* quicker than team - mate and rival @entity5
@entity44 qualified third as team - mate @entity84 broke down
@entity112 will start eighth - a *commendable* effort - in his @entity111
