by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:00 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 28 october 2013 justice minister @entity2 has announced new rules forcing criminals to listen to statements read out by their victims in court murderers , rapists and other criminals will be forced to sit in court and listen to victims and their families describe the misery and heartache caused by their crimes			1
victims will be given the right to read out a statement in court after conviction - and confront directly the criminals who damaged their lives			1
justice minister @entity2 said it would mean both offenders and judges were ‘ left in no doubt ’ about the full suffering of those hurt by criminality			1
if the victims choose to , they will read their statement out before sentencing , allowing the judge to take into account what they have said before setting a jail term or other sentence			1
currently , victim personal statements are often handed over to the judge on paper , with extracts sometimes read to the court			0
nearly one in ten victims say they do n’t remember even being offered the opportunity to write a statement			2
but as part of a new victims ’ @entity46 , to be published today , they will be given a guarantee that their side can be heard before sentencing begins			1
if they do not want to read it out themselves the prosecutor can do it for them			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ for too long victims have felt they are treated as an afterthought in the criminal justice system			1
i am determined that victims are given back their voice and are fully supported			2
he added : ‘ i want to create a tougher justice system			0
under this government those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer			0
i ’m making sure victims ’ voices are heard and that criminals no longer get away with just a slap on the wrist			2
’ the new rules were welcomed by the family of @entity73 , a @entity74 graduate who was murdered by her @entity76 factory worker boyfriend in a plot with his secret lover and the lover ’s uncle			1
@entity81 , 31 , @entity82 , 32 , and her uncle @entity83 , 38 , were convicted at @entity84 in june of murdering the 23 - year - old for a life insurance payout and a share of a house worth £ 137,000			0
victim : the new rules were welcomed by the family of @entity73 , a @entity74 graduate , who was murdered by her @entity76 factory worker boyfriend miss @entity73 ’s mother @entity90 , 46 submitted a statement to the court which was read by the judge			1
she told the @entity94 : ‘ i think every victim impact statement should be read out in court : it should be the right of the person whose life has been changed so badly			2
’ ‘ as witnesses you only answer the questions the barristers ask you , you ca n’t tell them your personal story			0
‘ in the statement , you can express your feelings about the person that you lost and your life without them			0
’ @entity73 ’s father @entity112 , 48 , said : ‘ we heard all the rubbish that came out from them for nine weeks			2
‘ at the end of it all victims should have their own right to express their feelings - and look those who did it in the eye			2
@entity73 ’s sister @entity124 , 22 , added : ‘ i think it ’s important for statements to be read out			1
i wanted to have the last say to those defendants			0
’ victims groups said the process of writing and reading out the statement can help victims cope and recover from the crime			2
earlier this year @entity134 , one of the victims of @entity136 kidnapper @entity134 , confronted him in court after being freed from more than a decade of captivity @entity140 , chief executive of @entity141 , said the change would give victims ‘ the choice to explain to a court in their own words the personal and emotional impacts a crime has had on them and their families			1
’ the new code , which will come in to force in december , will ensure extra support for victims of stalking , domestic abuse , terrorism and families bereaved by violent crime			0
it will explain what victims can expect from the criminal justice system from when they report a crime to the end of any trial , and make sure they are referred automatically to victims ’ service by the police			0
victims will also be given easier access to compensation if they are denied support by the system			0
and for the first time businessess - which are the victims of more than nine million crimes a year - will be given similar rights to individuals			1
the new rules on reading out statements are similar to those in force in parts of the @entity183			1
earlier this year one of the victims of @entity136 kidnapper @entity134 confronted him in court after being freed from more than a decade of captivity			0
@entity134 told @entity134 : ‘ you took 11 years of my life away , and now i have it back			0
