by @entity0 published : 14:44 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 29 april 2013 a hilarious spoof of political drama ‘ @entity4 ’ that debuted last night at the @entity6 ’ dinner saw @entity7 big leaguers taking aim at @entity11 heavyweights with the goading hand of star @entity13			1
the aptly titled ‘ @entity18 ’ starred @entity13 in the same role he plays on the @entity16 original series , that of remorseless politico @entity17			2
@entity19 is gunning for the best seats he can get at ‘ @entity21 ’ and goes to great lengths to get them in the video , reaching out to the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28			1
‘ he ’s the one that got fired from ' @entity44 , ' right ? ’ @entity26 asks			1
@entity26 also refused to sit beside former speaker of the house @entity45			1
‘ she keeps trying to friend me on @entity50 , ’ the 76 - year - old @entity48 senator complained			2
another equally unlikely , but just as funny , cameo was made by one of president @entity54 ’s closest confidantes , @entity27			1
‘ what on @entity57 happened , ’ @entity55 asked the fake congressman			0
‘ you know i was supposed to sit next to @entity60			0
’ and though he ’s had his problems with the president , even @entity63 mayor @entity28 shows up			1
reversal : @entity11 typically dogs @entity7 but politicos like senator @entity26 turned the tables last april 27 @entity27 , a @entity66 advisor , appeared in the spoof of the @entity16 series , starring @entity13 ‘ you ca n’t run for mayor again , ’ @entity19 counsels three - term mayor @entity28			1
‘ that ’ll put @entity73 in a pickle and then he ’ll tweet that pickle			0
’ several other notable lawmakers show up , including @entity4 minority whip @entity77 , who ’s hoarding @entity79 tickets , and everyone ’s favorite interviewer of politicians , @entity83			0
the first @entity16 series produced just for the streaming platform created a great deal of buzz after its february 1 release			0
that , paired with its propensity to portray the seedier , sharkier side of politics , makes it no surprise that @entity98 insiders would jump at the chance to help spoof ‘ @entity4 , ’ @entity11 , and themselves			0
and @entity13 ’s character closes the spoof with an appropriate greeting			0
‘ i hope some of you were taking notes … mr. president , welcome to @entity106			0
' levity : even normally droll @entity28 , center , poked fun at himself with a @entity111 gag			2

@entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 among the politicos willing to take a joke , at least for one night , at the annual ' @entity21 , ' held april 27
