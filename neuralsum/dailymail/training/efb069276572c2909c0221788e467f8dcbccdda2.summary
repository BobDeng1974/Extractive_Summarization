by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 12 november 2013 looking at these amazing pictures , you might be forgiven for thinking this animal is part dog , part mountain goat			0
in fact @entity6 is a @entity10 - @entity9 cross who was adopted from a rescue home four years ago			1
her amazing climbing skills are thanks to her loving owner , @entity15 , who has trained her to balance on almost anything she comes across			0
her repertoire does n't stop there either , as she can also run , hop and jump her away across fences , down balustrades and between concrete pillars			0
the dog has even mastered a gazelle - like leap from high - up places , such as a garage roof , back into the waiting arms of her owners			0
as well as balancing , @entity6 has been taught to navigate a range of obstacles			1
here she deftly tackles a stack of hay bales , leaping across them and off the other side @entity6 's repertoire of tricks even extends to climbing ladders , as she demonstrates here online some have compared @entity6 to a mountain goat , and as she leaps from rock to rock it is easy to see why @entity6 was rescued from the @entity59 in 2009 when she was severely underweight , had behavior issues and hair missing around her neck			1
the ten - month - old dog had a hard start but since then has found fame online thanks to her amazing tricks			1
boarder collies are otherwise known as sheep dogs and are bred for their intelligence , energy , obedience and ability to learn a range of commands quickly			0
while @entity6 's balance is perfect , she may need to improve her riding skills as she 's facing the wrong way they are often used in films and advertising because they are friendly and easy to control			2
labradors are more laid back than collies but are equally intelligent and responsive to training , so it is easy to see how @entity6 picked up on all of her tricks			1
@entity15 told @entity88 : ' she loves to balance on anything and loves to jump into her owner 's arms from the ground or high up			0
' @entity15 also has another dog , @entity95 , a poodle who has also been taught an impressive array of tricks from balancing along a beam to jumping over other animals .			2

@entity102 rescued @entity6 , a @entity19 - @entity9 cross , in 2009
she was severely underweight , had missing *fur* and was badly behaved
however she has now returned to *health* and learned an array of tricks
