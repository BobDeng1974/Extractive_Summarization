students , parents and staff at a @entity4 high school are horrified after the discovery students have been drinking treated sewage water from a bubbler on campus for more than a year			1
in a letter sent to all parents during the school holidays , the principal of @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity9 admitted that ‘ @entity16 ’ recycled water had been inadvertently connected to an outdoor drinking fountain			1
the bubbler had been dispensing recycled water for 16 months – from december 17 2013 until april 1 2015			1
‘ the cross-connection came to our attention through the maintenance staff of the college on the 30th of march , 2015 , ’ mr @entity9 wrote in the letter , issued on april 14			0
unfortunately for students , ‘ @entity16 ’ recycled water is sewage that has been treated to a standard that ’s safe for watering gardens , washing clothes and flushing toilets			1
students at @entity4 high school @entity11 were drinking from a bubbling dispensing recycled water for more than a year although it is the highest quality of recycled water , the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption			1
whilst drinking the water , the students would have been at a greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis or diarrhoea due to the possible presence of a parasite , @entity43			2
an investigation has been launched by the @entity45 to assess the extent of the possible health impact on the students			2
the principal assured students , parents and staff that the drinking fountain was shut down on april 1 and is no longer in use			0
the other 20 bubblers at the school have been tested and none show traces of recycled water			1
the ongoing investigation will determine the number of students who have drunk from the water foundation since it became contaminated			2
although it is the highest quality of recycled water , the water that the students had been consuming is not considered acceptable for consumption ‘ @entity66 has advised that drinking the @entity16 recycled water may have led to a slightly increased risk of gastro , ’ the principal warned			1
however , preliminary testing of the chemicals present in the drinking water from the bubbler found that ‘ the vast majority were at very low concentrations ’ , meaning the student were unlikely to have been harmed from consuming the water			0
@entity78 spoke with a number of parents of @entity82 's students			0
all the parents were unaware of any cases of gastro or anyone who believed they 'd been adversely affected by the bubbler			0
a @entity90 official will be on site at the school on thursday april 16 to respond to concerns the parents may have			0
‘ if anyone is suffering from a gastrointestinal illness and experiencing symptoms such as vomiting , diarrhoea and abdominal pain , they should seek advice from their gp , ’ mr @entity9 advised			0
families and staff are being encouraged to contact the @entity45 on 1300 761 874			0
