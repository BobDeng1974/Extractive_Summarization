@entity0 has an estimated 421 million fewer birds today than it did 30 years ago as modern farming methods and urbanisation have caused their habitats to vanish , according to a new study			1
most of the birds lost , around 90 per cent , have been the most common and widespread species , including sparrows , skylarks , grey partridges and starlings			2
scientists believe the population crash can be linked to modern farming methods and deteriorating and fragmenting habitats			2
declining : common birds such as starlings ( pictured ) are declining in numbers as scientists find @entity0 has an estimated 421 million fewer birds today than it did 30 years ago ' it is very worrying that the most common species of bird are declining rapidly because it is this group of birds that people benefit from the most , ' said dr @entity28 , one of the researchers from the @entity30			1
' it is becoming increasingly clear that interaction with the natural world and wildlife is central to human well - being , and significant loss of common birds could be quite detrimental to human society			0
' however , the study found that not all common birds are declining and populations of great tits , blue tits , robins and blackbirds , are all going up			2
risk : around 90 per cent of the birds lost have been common species , such as starlings which were seen creating shape - shifting cloud formations above the rooftops of @entity51 , @entity52 , earlier this week in decline : scientists believe the population crash can be linked to modern farming methods and deteriorating and fragmenting habitats rare species such as marsh harriers , ravens , buzzards , storks and stone curlews had also shown increases in recent years , which researchers said was probably due to conservation efforts			1
the research , co-led by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , is published in the journal @entity70			0
' the rarer birds in this study , whose populations are increasing , have benefited from protection across @entity0 , ' said dr @entity76 , from the @entity68 's @entity77			2
encouragement : populations of great tits , blue tits ( pictured ) , robins and blackbirds , are all going up flying high : rare species such as marsh harriers ( left ) and ravens ( right ) are also increasing in number ' for example , white storks and marsh harriers receive among the highest level of protection in the @entity92 - this is why their numbers have increased			1
' the conservation and legal protection of all birds and their habitats in tandem are essential to reverse declines			0
' this is a warning from birds throughout @entity0			0
it is clear that the way we are managing the environment is unsustainable for many of our most familiar species			0
' worry : dr @entity28 said it is worrying that the most common species of bird , such as starlings , are declining rapidly because ' it is this group of birds that people benefit from the most ' dr @entity116 said that ' interaction with the natural world and wildlife is central to human well - being ' , so losing vast numbers of common birds could be ' detrimental to human society ' the scientists analysed data on 144 species of @entity0 birds collected from numerous surveys in 25 different countries			1
much of the information was provided by thousands of volunteer fieldworkers who identified and counted birds in the areas where they lived			0
the researchers concluded that more conservation should be directed at wider - scale environmental improvement , such as urban green space projects and effective environmental schemes aimed at farmland			0

@entity0 has around 421 million fewer birds today than three *decades* ago
around 90 *%* of birds lost have been widespread species such as sparrows
scientists say population crash is linked to farming and vanishing habitats
but numbers of great tits , blue tits , robins and blackbirds going up
rare species such as ravens and stalks are also on the rise
scientists studied data on 144 species of @entity0 birds in 25 countries
