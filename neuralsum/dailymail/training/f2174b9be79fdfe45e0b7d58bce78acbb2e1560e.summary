by @entity0 published : 14:54 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 14:58 est , 30 january 2014 the cuttlefish can change the colour and pattern of its skin to stay hidden from predators			1
and now @entity9 scientists are looking to the fish ’s camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers , which could help them to blend in with their surroundings in realtime			1
they have discovered new details about neural organs called chromatophores , which enable the ‘ chameleon of the sea ’ to virtually disappear			1
scientists are looking to the cuttlefish 's ( pictured ) camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers , which could help them to blend in with their surroundings as well as the cephalopod cuttlefish skin is unique for its dynamic patterning and speed of change			1
the cephalopod has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues			1
to regulate its colour , the cuttlefish relies on a vertically arranged assembly of three optical components : the leucophore , which is a near - perfect light scatterer that reflects it uniformly over the entire visible spectrum , the iridophore , which is a reflector containing a stack of thin films and the chromatophore			2
this layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours			0
chromatophores contain luminescent protein nanostructures that enable the cuttlefish to make quick and elaborate changes in its skin pigmentation			2
when the cuttlefish switches on its coloration system , each chromatophore expands			2
the surface area can change as much as 500 per cent			0
scientists at @entity64 and the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) believe their findings could also lead to new types of paint , cosmetics and consumer electronics – as well as smart uniforms for soldiers that can react to surroundings in realtime			1
‘ nature solved the riddle of adaptive camouflage a long time ago , ' @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 at the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) told the @entity83			0
‘ now , the challenge is to reverse - engineer this system in a cost - efficient , synthetic system that is amenable to mass manufacturing			0
’ the cuttlefish has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues , but scientists have had an incomplete understanding of the biological , chemical and optical functions that make this adaptive coloration possible			1
to regulate its colour , the cuttlefish relies on a vertically arranged assembly of three optical components : the leucophore , which is a near - perfect light scatterer that reflects it uniformly over the entire visible spectrum , the iridophore , which is a reflector containing a stack of thin films and the chromatophore			2
researchers are trying to reverse - engineer the cuttlefish 's chromatophore system in a cost - efficient , synthetic system that is amenable to mass manufacturing so that it can be used as a new type of camouflage uniform for soldiers ( stock image ) this layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours , co-author @entity126 , a @entity127 in bioengineering at @entity79 explained			1
‘ @entity129 were previously considered to be pigmentary organs that acted simply as selective colour filters , ’ she said			2
‘ but our results suggest that they play a more complex role - they contain luminescent protein nanostructures that enable the cuttlefish to make quick and elaborate changes in its skin pigmentation			2
’ when the cuttlefish switches on its coloration system , each chromatophore expands			2
the surface area can change as much as 500 per cent , the scientists explained in a paper published in the @entity145			0
the team of researchers showed that within the chromatophore , tethered pigment granules regulate light through absorbance , reflection , and fluorescence - in effect functioning as tiny light - sensitive elements , even as the chromatophore changes in size			0
‘ the cuttlefish uses an ingenious approach to materials composition and structure - one that we have never employed in our engineered displays , ’ said co-author @entity159 , @entity160 and of @entity161 at @entity79			0
‘ it is extremely challenging for us to replicate the mechanisms that the cuttlefish uses			0
the cuttlefish ( pictured ) has neutrally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues and blend in with its surroundings ‘ for example , we can not yet engineer materials that have the elasticity to expand 500 times in surface area and were we able to do that , the richness of colour of the expanded and unexpanded material would be dramatically different			1
she explained : ‘ the cuttlefish may have found a way to compensate for this change in richness of colour by being an " active " light emitter not simply modulating light through passive reflection			0
’ scientists from the @entity65 have examined adaptive colouration in the cuttlefish and other invertebrates for many years			1
@entity65 's @entity201 said : ‘ cuttlefish skin is unique for its dynamic patterning and speed of change			1
' ‘ deciphering the relative roles of pigments and reflectors in soft , flexible skin is a key step to translating the principles of actuation to materials science and engineering			0
‘ this collaborative project expanded our breadth of inquiry and uncovered several useful surprises , such as the tether system that connects the individual pigment granules			0
’ professor @entity76 is an army reservist who completed two tours of duty in @entity223 , so using the cuttlefish to find a biologically inspired design for new types of military camouflage carries special meaning for him as poor camouflage patterns can cost lives on the battlefield			1
‘ throughout history , people have dreamed of having an invisible suit , ’ he said			0
‘ nature solved that problem and now it ’s up to us to replicate this genius , so , like the cuttlefish , we can avoid our predators			0

scientists at @entity64 and the @entity65 have discovered new details about the cuttlefish 's neural organs
their findings could also lead to new types of paint , cosmetics and consumer electronics – as well as smart uniforms for soldiers
