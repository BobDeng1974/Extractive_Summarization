by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 1 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:35 est , 1 november 2013 when we get to adulthood we have a tendency to hold our noses , cover our eyes with goggles and plug our ears when we go underwater			1
but it 's a different story for babies			2
they have a gag reflex , and being submerged reminds them of being in the womb , meaning when they go under water they look utterly at peace			2
' up to around six months they have a gag reflex which means they hold their breath automatically , ' says underwater photographer @entity24			1
underwater photographer @entity24 , 33 , from @entity25 , was a @entity26 news photographer before embarking on her new career taking photos of children swimming the baby is submerged , let go for a second while @entity24 takes the photos then brought straight back up @entity24 first started to dabble with underwater photography at @entity34 when she learned to scuba dive @entity24 , 33 , who founded her brand new company @entity36 , takes pictures of the confident waterbabies , capturing a brief moment as they explore an underwater world			1
the babies have been attending swimming lessons for a while before the shoot in order to get comfortable with swimming and being submerged			2
' at the shoot , the parents says the baby 's name , then says ' ready , swim ! ' and then the baby is submerged , ' says @entity24			1
' they are let go for a couple of seconds while i take the photos then brought straight back up			2
' ' it does n't give me very long to take the pictures but i only need a few seconds as my camera can take six frames per second			0
' @entity24 says the older children especially love dressing up for their photo shoot the babies are n't underwater for very long but it looks that way as @entity24 freezes that split second in time @entity24 takes the pictures very quickly , she only needs a few seconds as her camera takes 6 frames per second ' i ask that babies have done a term of baby swimming lessons that include submersions			1
' this means they gradually over a few months , build up to going under the water			0
it starts with splashing on the head , then face , and builds up to a full submersion			0
' so in reality the babies are n't underwater for very long at all			1
it just looks that way as we freeze that split second in time			0
@entity24 , from @entity25 , @entity85 , first started to dabble with underwater photography at @entity34 when she learned to scuba dive			1
' i have continued experimenting with it for over a decade and have invested heavily in the equipment			0
my previous work is in stark contrast to the underwater portraiture			2
' @entity24 , who now travels across the @entity93 , including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 to carry out her underwater snaps , worked as a news photographer for more than a decade			1
' it often involved waiting outside in the cold , whereas baby swimming pools are kept at a nice warm 30 degrees , ' she says			0
@entity102 , 6 months , looks serene in her underwater photo by @entity104 @entity24 trained to be a baby and pre-school swimming teacher too so she can teach babies to swim herself she just decided to take the plunge and see what happens if she devotes all her efforts to a business ' also , a lot of the time in news photography , you have to photograph people who do n't want their picture taking , like people leaving court , but the babies do n't complain , mostly			1
' i will certainly miss the adrenaline rush of news photography : getting a call telling you to catch the next flight to @entity128 , or get to the hospital , @entity120 of @entity121 is in labour ! ' but i love the creativity of underwater photography and the unusual images you can capture			1
' ' i 've always had an entrepreneurial streak but having worked full time for newspapers my entire working life i have n't had the time to pursue any of my ideas fully			0
' i 've had a few failed businesses that i ran on the side such as strawberry wine , painted glass and ceramic gargoyles			0
the underwater photography seems quite sensible in comparison			1
i just decided to take the plunge and see what happens if i devote all my efforts to a business			2
' it feels like every picture you can conceive on land has already been taken , because photography is so popular now , but with underwater , it 's a whole new angle			1
' i trained to be a baby and pre-school swimming teacher too so i can teach the babies to swim myself as safety is very important			0
so this really is quite a career change			0
' i 'm not a mum yet myself but if i have one , it 's sure to be the most photographed swimming baby around			0
' prices start at Â £ 30 for half an hour in the pool with up to five other children			2
customers get free use of costumes provided and up to six submersions			0
pictures are then paid for separately if they choose to buy any , starting at Â £ 30 .			0
