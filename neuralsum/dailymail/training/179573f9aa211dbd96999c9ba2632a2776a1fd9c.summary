' one of our inspectors has gone out to check it and he is happy this seal is fit and healthy			2
' seals will swim down rivers in search of food			0
this seal appears to be following a dredger that is turning up fish , it is likely this easy meal is what has brought the seal inland			2

' it 's rare , as the seal is typically on the coast in salty water			0
' my advice to people would be to not approach the seal as it is a wild animal and it could bite			0
it could also be dangerous for dogs			0
' he added : ' it is very hard to catch a seal when it 's healthy , it is an enormous risk			2
' more often than not , when you approach a seal on land it will go back into the water			0
' but if it 's poorly then you have more chance of catching them and we can then give them an immediate inspection and bring them back to a rescue centre			0
