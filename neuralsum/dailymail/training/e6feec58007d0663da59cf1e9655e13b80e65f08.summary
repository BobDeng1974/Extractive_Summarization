an @entity0 on holiday in @entity2 a century ago found a country with little to recommend it			1
waking up on the first morning and consulting his guide book , he would have read the following description : ‘ @entity2 is a bleak and often arid land , with few traces of picturesqueness			1
’ the towns , the guide continues , are wreathed in tobacco smoke and the cafes are ‘ very deficient in comfort and cleanliness ’			2
the guide further warns that the service from waiters , chambermaids and porters is generally very slack and that the traveller should always count his change			2
in the @entity2 countryside there is great danger of highway robbery , while in the cities the police will arrest anyone they can lay their hands on			1
@entity32 work : edwardian tourists riding on donkeys and camela with their native guides at the @entity37 at @entity38 , @entity39 in 1910 the railway carriages and omnibuses are so filthy that a clothes brush , a duster and some insect powder should always be at hand			1
as for the national sport of bull fighting , it is ‘ the most unsportsmanlike and cowardly spectacle ’ a civilised man will ever see			2
this is the account of @entity2 given in the 1914 @entity52			1
these small , red books , bound in leather , were the first recourse for an @entity0 abroad in the late 19th and early 20th century			0
i came to @entity57 through my maternal grandfather , who amassed a collection of more than 130 of the red guides			1
he was possessed by a particularly keen sense of wanderlust , even into his 80s , and bought many hundreds of antique travel books			0
the tone of the @entity57 guides is informed , detailed , authoritative — and riotously , unguardedly rude			1
alongside the city maps , ferry time - tables , and guides to churches , monuments and museums , there are unforgiving comments on the ‘ natives ’ a traveller might have the misfortune to encounter			1
the @entity2 are indolent , the @entity78 filthy , the @entity79 dishonest and the ‘ orientals ’ as stupid as children			1
the guides reflect an imperial attitude that would be unthinkable today			2
for a century , @entity57 — founded in 1832 by @entity84 publisher @entity57 — was the indispensable guide to @entity86 , the @entity87 and beyond			1
he prized himself on the accuracy of his books and was once discovered keeping count of how many stairs there were to the roof of @entity95 cathedral by placing a coin on every 20th step			0
he wanted his readers to know exactly how far they would have to climb			0
by the outbreak of @entity102 , 992 editions of the guides had been published , covering @entity86 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity87			2
after @entity84 , @entity106 was the biggest consumer of the books			1
it was the red @entity57 , small enough to fit in an overcoat pocket , which the @entity111 took as protection when they ventured abroad			1
today , many people know of @entity57 through reading or watching the film adaptation of @entity117 ’s @entity116			1
in the opening chapters , our heroine @entity116 ( played in the film by @entity122 ) finds herself in @entity123 without a @entity57			1
a vintage @entity57 , which is guilty of terrible racial stereotypes the guide is supposed to be a shield against @entity79 passion and without its protective influence , @entity126 finds herself being kissed by an @entity0 made hot - blooded by the @entity132 sun. the name was also made famous by the @entity134 when the @entity84 targeted bombing campaigns over @entity0 cities such as @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity139 , singled out for their architectural beauty by @entity57 ’s guide to @entity106			1
the aim was to depress morale by destroying our regency terraces , cathedrals and medieval streets			0
in return , the @entity148 razed @entity150 , demolishing the @entity151			0
reading the guides today you are struck by how patrician they are in their view of the world			2
these are books for travellers from the two great @entity86 imperial powers : @entity106 and @entity84			1
in an age before political correctness , it was possible to be really very rude indeed about foreigners			0
it is not just the @entity2 who are liable to run off with your change			1
in @entity79 , according to my grand - father ’s 1912 guide , extortion is the national hobby and begging the national plague			1
customs officials unfailingly pilfer your luggage and the cab - drivers , boatmen and porters are insolent and rapacious to ‘ an almost incredible pitch ’			0
the guide explains that while the ‘ evil sanitary reputation of @entity183 ’ is often exaggerated , it remains a filthy city			2
the southern @entity79 , @entity57 explains , believe the ‘ brilliancy ’ of their climate more than makes up for the dirt			1
travellers are advised to stay in hotels with iron bedsteads as these are less likely to be infested with the ‘ enemies of repose ’ — @entity57 ’s dainty euphemism for bedbugs			1
still , the guide cheerfully concludes , things have improved greatly since the cholera epidemic of 1884 , though travellers are advised not to order oysters as they have been known to cause typhus			0
the bedclothes at the inns are full of ‘ fleas , bedbugs , lice			0
and other disgusting insects , winged and wingless ’			0
you can not even console yourself with a glass of wine for the @entity78 vintages are universally ‘ insipid and weak ’			1
tangiers market in @entity214 is ‘ an indescribable mass of @entity217 humanity ’ ; and in @entity39 , any traveller who comes into contact with the natives ‘ should avoid rubbing their eyes with their hands ’			1
you could n’t get away with that in a @entity228 guide today			0
indeed , some of @entity57 ’s advice will appal modern sensibilities			1
in @entity232 , you are advised to ward off stray dogs with an umbrella and in @entity39 it is acceptable to hit a cab driver with your walking stick			2
you are , however , advised to ‘ sternly repress ’ the urge to prod a donkey with a stick to encourage it to gallop			0
( the original owner of my grandfather ’s 1914 @entity39 guide , a @entity241 from @entity242 , put an emphatic ‘ x ’ in the margin next to this advice			0
) overall , the poor @entity39 are given a hard time of it			0
the average native , explains @entity57 , is ‘ no more intelligent than a child ’			1
@entity57 is not just guilty of terrible racial stereotypes			1
he also has a very dim view of the capabilities of women			0
a female traveller is a delicate creature who can not possibly manage certain activities			2
when it comes to climbing @entity264 , for example , a man may do it on foot , but as this is too ‘ fatiguing ’ for ladies , they are advised to take the train			0
i can say with great satisfaction that i managed it perfectly well as a 13 - year - old schoolgirl			0
few countries escape @entity57 ’s censure , although the @entity278 are grudgingly admired for their cleanliness : ‘ spiders appear to be regarded with special aversion and vermin is fortunately as rare as cobwebs			2
’ @entity84 , of course , is beyond reproach			2
but what of @entity106 ? certainly , we fare better than some countries			2
‘ as compared with @entity291 hotels , ’ explains the 1927 guide , ‘ @entity111 hotels may be said as a rule to excel in cleanliness and sanitary arrangements			0
’ so far so good , though the guide adds that some hotels can be tolerated by gentlemen , but certainly not by ladies			0
our cuisine is inferior and monotonous and the national dish , the guide remarks disparagingly , is tea with chips and steak			0
as for the @entity111 themselves , @entity57 observes that the country is ‘ a place of parsons , puppy dogs and peculiar people ’			1
after @entity313 , @entity312 disappeared from @entity111 shelves			0
other guides such as @entity228 , the @entity316 and @entity317 took their place			2
then , in 2007 , the series was relaunched			0
the red covers remain , but they now come in wipe - clean , plastic jackets			0
practical , but with none of the romance of my grandfather ’s red leather hardbacks			0
in tone they are indistinguishable from other guidebooks			0
there is nothing to match @entity57 ’s sniffy comment on visiting large towns in @entity0 : ‘ we need hardly caution newcomers against the artifices of pickpockets and wiles of impostors			2
’ nor are they as evocative as the originals — for there are passages of lyrical description amid the scorpions and bedbugs			0
the scenery of @entity200 , for example , is celebrated for ‘ its mountains , its deep - blue gulfs and its clear , ethereal atmosphere which brings distant objects close to the beholder and robs shadows of their depth and gloom ’			0
while i do n’t advocate a return to the days when edwardian guides advised travellers to wash their hands if they so much as touched a foreigner , there is something refreshing about @entity57 ’s acerbic comments on the food , hotels and manners of foreign climes			1
this week , many of us will return from august holidays in @entity374 , @entity2 and @entity79 rather wishing someone had warned us that the local taxis smell like goat sheds , that the paella will make you desperately ill and that you can not get a decent cup of @entity381 anywhere in the @entity383 .			1
