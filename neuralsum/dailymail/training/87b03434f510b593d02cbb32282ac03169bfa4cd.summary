by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was 16 years ago at @entity4 ’s @entity3 that the last best - of - five match was played in women ’s tennis , with @entity8 beating @entity9 in what turned out to be four sets			1
the idea has not been tried since that meeting at the @entity15 year - end championships , but in the wake of a crushingly one - sided women ’s @entity22 final , the possibility of women going the same length as the men has been raised			1
@entity24 has suggested that the best - of - five format from semi-finals onwards might be the best antidote to the kind of 55 - minute hammering of @entity30 by @entity31 , which left some fans feeling shortchanged after paying £ 124 for a ticket on saturday			1
hard work ? @entity36 ( right ) played five sets while @entity31 breezed to the title champions : @entity36 and @entity31 pose with their trophies following their @entity22 victories the comparison with sunday ’s four - hour epic between @entity36 and @entity45 also stirred up the debate about the equal pay that is now a fixture at @entity48			1
the idea of extending women ’s matches was gaining little support as @entity22 closed down on monday			1
‘ i can see that it was n’t great value for money on this occasion , but it is n’t a change i would like to see , ’ said @entity53 , former @entity54 champion			0
‘ @entity30 was blown away a bit as was @entity62 last year , but then we have just had an excellent @entity54 final a few weeks ago ( @entity64 beat @entity65 over three hours )			1
‘ i ’m hoping that this new generation of players will make it more competitive at the top			0
also the three week gap between @entity54 and @entity22 next year will make a difference - you are going to see players more comfortable on the surface			0
’ time for change ? @entity24 has suggested the best - of - five format should return from semi-finals onwards with women ’s tennis fought out from baseline to baseline , the extra pounding the already stressed show courts would take from longer matches was a concern raised by @entity84 ’s former world no 5 @entity85			1
‘ the women have never objected to playing best of five and they are certainly capable of doing it , ’ she said			1
‘ but the women ’s game is different to the men ’s and women are made differently			1
three sets is a good fit to me			0
there is a danger of a knee - jerk reaction			0
’ former @entity84 no 1 @entity99 agreed , saying : ‘ they tried it in @entity4 and it did n’t work			0
women ’s matches tend to take longer and there were tv scheduling problems			1
’ while there have been many one - sided women ’s @entity48 finals in recent years it is a myth that they have all been that way			2
the last two @entity113 finals have gone to a deciding set , as have three of the last five @entity115 finals			2
last time : @entity9 and @entity8 played in the last best - of - five match 16 years ago yet there is no escaping that straight - set climaxes to women ’s championships have become commonplace			1
of the combined last 24 women ’s finals at @entity54 , @entity22 and the @entity113 , 20 have been over in two sets			2
@entity125 , coach of one of the women ’s game ’s rising stars , @entity131 @entity130 , is also against the move			2
‘ it would alter the whole dynamic of the matches			2
someone like @entity130 is conditioned to play best of three			0
playing a potential five is very different			0
if you do it for two rounds you have to do it for all seven			0
’ and that , as pointed out by @entity143 @entity84 player and @entity145 commentator @entity144 , would bring enormous challenges			0
‘ you would have to start early to fit it all in , especially at @entity22 , and you could have players walking out to empty stands			0
‘ the argument about equal prize - money because they play shorter matches is a non-starter for me , as it ’s about quality and enjoyment			2
how could people who like tennis not have been impressed by the quality of @entity31 ’s ball striking ? ’ for most people the calibre of matches and the narrative at the top of men ’s tennis has way outshone the women in the current era of @entity45 , @entity172 and co. it is why men ’s final tickets , with the solitary add - on of the mixed doubles final , were priced at £ 148 compared to saturday ’s £ 124 for the women ’s , which also included the women ’s doubles and an outstanding men ’s doubles final			1
the difference in unofficial prices was far greater			0
in five years things may have changed considerably , with the women ’s game likely to regain lost ground in public affection as male superstars fade away			2
regardless , any reversal of the equal prize - money policy is never going to happen .			0
