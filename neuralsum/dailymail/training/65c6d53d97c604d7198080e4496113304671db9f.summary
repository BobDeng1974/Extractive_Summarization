by @entity1 correspondent the @entity2 is to spend £ 20,000 sending staff from @entity4 and @entity5 to @entity6 ... just so they can meet for the first time			1
around 200 staff will be forced to travel hundreds of miles by train to attend the four - hour conference on june 27 so they can have ‘ a chance to get acquainted ’			1
and despite spending £ 1billion on new headquarters in @entity4 , bosses have hired a state - of - the - art conference centre for the event , as well as laying on refreshments at further cost to the licence - fee payer			1
new headquarters : the @entity2 is to spend £ 20,000 sending staff from @entity4 and @entity5 to @entity6 for a four - hour conference			1
this is despite the corporation spending £ 1billion on new @entity4 headquarters ( above ) yesterday , the plan was branded a ‘ complete waste of money ’ by a @entity2 employee , who contacted the @entity27 anonymously			1
he said holding the event in @entity6 , which is 90 miles from @entity4 and 120 miles from @entity5 , would double the rail cost , adding : ‘ most of us are not getting pay rises , again			2
yet there is money to waste on this			0
we want answers and accountability from over-paid bosses			0
’ in an email to staff on the @entity2 ’s ‘ platform group ’ , a part of its @entity45 department , a senior executive said the conference would : ‘ give us a chance to get acquainted			2
’ she said : ‘ our team is split across @entity5 and @entity4 , but we want everyone to be together in one place – just for the one day , and we feel it ’s well worth the effort ! host city : around 200 staff will be forced to travel hundreds of miles by train to attend the conference in @entity6 ( pictured ) on june 27			1
the event aims to give @entity2 employees ' a chance to get acquainted ' ‘ having researched the options available , we ’ve chosen a venue in @entity61 terms of cost and time , this was the best option for getting everyone together in one location			1
we ’re going to book rail travel for staff , which we also feel is most convenient and time efficient			0
’ she added : ‘ one of our goals for the day is that it ’s interactive , and provides sufficient opportunity for you to meet and talk with colleagues in a way that you do n’t normally have the opportunity to do			0
in other words , we promise the @entity78 will not be loads of @entity80 ! ’ concern : @entity83 , of the @entity82 , said the @entity6 conference was ' a shocking waste of the licence fee ' since the @entity2 set up its £ 1billion headquarters in @entity4 in 2011 , it has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money shipping staff around the country			1
last year , it emerged it had paid its own staff £ 24million to relocate to the @entity94 without asking them to provide receipts to prove their expense claims			0
staff who did not wish to move to @entity4 permanently were instead allowed to commute there for two years and receive £ 1,900 a month to cover the cost of renting an apartment in the city			2
so far , the @entity2 has spent £ 4million on trains and hotels for staff visiting the base , with more than £ 300,000 going on first class rail tickets			2
yesterday , @entity83 from the @entity108 ’ @entity82 said the @entity6 conference was ‘ a shocking waste of the licence fee ’			2
he added : ‘ there ’s no reason why staff from @entity4 could n’t come to @entity5 , or vice versa , and using a halfway house is only pushing up the cost			0
' there has to be more accountability among senior bosses at the @entity2 , or sympathy for the licence fee will swiftly evaporate			0
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ this is a one off meeting and the only time this year the teams from @entity5 and @entity4 will be brought together			0
' @entity6 is the most practicable location for teams that are split across the country , and we have made savings wherever possible			0
