it was the first foreign @entity1 nuclear base , built in @entity2 three years before the @entity4 missile crises and ready for an attack on @entity6			1
@entity1 nuclear missiles 20 times more powerful than @entity8 were set up here , primed to be fired at targets including @entity10 and nuclear bases in eastern @entity12			1
but since it was built in 1959 in the picturesque woods of @entity16 , @entity13 has become an eerie ghost town , reclaimed by nature			1
ready for attack : bunkers covered in sand for missiles and hardened concrete bunkers for warheads lay in the camp primed : a rocket launcher able to fire at targets up to 1,200km ( 750 miles ) away was also on site reclaimed : the base has been largely overtaken by nature there was once a garrison town for 15,000 people in this wood in what was then @entity2 , with a theatre , shops , offices , a gym and a school			1
but the camp was extremely well hidden , concealed from spy planes and prying eyes by birch trees			1
an obelisk which bares the silhouette of @entity47 still stands and peeling murals featuring brightly coloured paintings of swans flying and a sailing ship remain at the school			0
the upright figure of @entity47 , and a mural of @entity55 tanks in action , are also featured on the wall outside			0
bunkers covered in sand for missiles and hardened concrete bunkers for warheads lie elsewhere on the camp , once ready for attack			0
well hidden : the camp was concealed from spy planes and prying eyes by birch trees leader : an obelisk featuring the silhouette of @entity47 faded remains : a mural of @entity55 tanks in action , are also featured on the wall outside an area which was once the site where weapons of mass destruction would have been launched , is now nothing more than a beautiful clearing amidst the trees			1
this idyllic glade features a concrete platform , on which there is a metal plate for the rocket launcher able to fire at targets up to 1,200km ( 750 miles ) away , and which could have easily reached @entity10 , which lies just 1,000km away			0
it is almost impossible to see the sky from the glade , which means it would also have been barely visible to the prying spy planes of the 1960s			0
according to secret @entity96 intelligence reports released since the end of the @entity98 , the base was set up in 1959 , the @entity93 reports			2
in @entity4 , aerial photographs used as evidence were clear and after two weeks of tension , the @entity1 backed down and agreed to remove the weapons			1
but the rocket base in @entity2 was far less visible			2
secret @entity104 reports dated august 11 , 1960 , and entitled ' @entity105 in @entity2 ' piece together the puzzle of where the base could be			2
eerie reminder : brightly coloured murals featuring swans and ships remain on the walls of the camp 's school abandoned : the camp was left in 1994 when the @entity55 removed anything that they could from the base first foreign base : the camp was designed to target the west the glade features a concrete platform on which there is a metal plate for the rocket launcher the @entity96 knew there was a new missile and trailer system in use because it had been shown to the @entity132 and cameras on @entity134 in 1957 and 1960			1
they also knew the @entity1 was too distant for it to reach prime @entity6 targets			1
details which appear to have come from @entity6 agents in @entity2 who observed what was going on around them on the railways and roads between @entity141 and @entity2 helped to piece together the puzzle			0
@entity104 reports reveal that agents had seen ' a very slow moving column of @entity1 military vehicles ' heading from the ' direction in which the @entity148 airfield and a railroad loading ramp are located in a northwesterly direction along the western outskirts of @entity148			1
' a few months later , another observation noted : ' a group of eight trailers probably identical to the @entity156 parade trailer , based on analysis of available photography , was observed entering @entity2 by rail at @entity160 , on 9 september , 1959			0
' special military train shipments , suspected of carrying unidentified @entity1 missiles and related equipment were also seen at several other locations in @entity2 during 1959			2
from all of the clues , the @entity104 concluded the camp in the forest north of @entity168 was going to be used for mobile launchers of nuclear weapons			2
hidden : a bunker at the base concealed by mountains of sand overgrown : although the buildings , including shops , a school and a theatre still remain , they are gradually being overtaken by nature a later @entity104 account told a story of the @entity1 leader , @entity183 , asking a military designer how many nuclear missiles it would take to destroy @entity187 and @entity188			1
those missiles would have been fired from this camp			0
the missiles deployed in @entity2 in spring 1959 , were withdrawn later in the year			0
however , unaware , the @entity104 , was still concerned about their presence in the country in early 1961			0
@entity195 's dr @entity194 , an expert on @entity6 intelligence operations in @entity2 , told the @entity197 deployed the weapons as part of a policy of ' nuclear blackmail			2
' he said : ' he threatened in 1956 , at the time of the @entity203 , to use nuclear weapons , and he very much regarded his threat as successful , so he saw nuclear blackmail as a valuable policy initiative and he needed , therefore , the nuclear missiles to back that up			0
' according to secret @entity96 intelligence reports , the base was set up in 1959 @entity194 said he believed they were withdrawn in connection with @entity183 's demand in november 1958 that @entity6 countries should leave @entity168			0
as @entity218 announced plans to defend @entity168 and to cross @entity2 territory the threat of a full - scale war looked imminent			0
for years after @entity13 was the headquarters of the @entity1 's 25th @entity222 , the third biggest @entity1 military base in @entity2 .			1

concealed by birch trees and amidst dense woodland , @entity13 was the first foreign @entity1 nuclear base
it has now become an eerie ghost town , reclaimed by nature
