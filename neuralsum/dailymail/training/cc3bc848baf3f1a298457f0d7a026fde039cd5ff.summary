' his turn on the stand : @entity14 seen arriving at a courthouse at military base @entity17 , @entity31 where he will testify about the treatment he received during his two - years in prison the noose : this artist rendering shows @entity37			1
@entity14 being shown a bedsheet as he testified in his pretrial @entity40 hearing wearing his dress uniform , he appeared nervous , stuttering over his words as he tried to answer questions from a defense attorney about his arrest in @entity46 in may 2010			1
he was testifying only about his arrest and confinement and not about how he leaked classified documents to @entity40			1
seated in the witness booth , he swiveled back and forth and gestured with his hands as he described the layout of his confinement quarters overseas			2
' i was in a pretty stressed situation ... i was getting very little information ' from his attorney while he was being held , he said , noting that he felt increasingly ‘ hopeless ’			1
' i had pretty much given up			2
my world had just shrunk , ' @entity14 said , explaining how he had suicidal thoughts while being held by authorities			2

' i totally started to fall apart , ' the 24 - year - old said			2

goal : @entity14 is trying to avoid trial in the @entity40 case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in @entity65 , @entity66 , and had to sleep naked for several nights earlier thursday , a military judge accepted the terms under which @entity14 would plead guilty to eight charges for sending classified documents to the secret - spilling @entity40 website			1
colonel @entity86 's ruling does n't mean the pleas have been formally accepted			2
that could happen in december			0
but @entity86 approved the language of the offenses to which @entity14 would admit			0
she said those offenses carry a total maximum prison term of 16 years			0
@entity14 made the offer as a way of accepting responsibility for the leak			0
smile : @entity14 was decidedly more excited when he appeared in court for the first time on tuesday ( pictured ) controversial : supporters stood outside the @entity31 military courthouse where he was due to appear tuesday make or break : if a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned , though that is not expected to happen government officials have not said whether they would continue prosecuting him for the other 14 counts he faces , including aiding the enemy			0
that offense carries a maximum penalty of life in prison			0
under the proposal , @entity14 would admit to willfully sending the following material : a battlefield video file , some classified memos , more than 20 iraq war logs , more than 20 @entity118 war logs and other classified materials			0
he would also plead guilty to wrongfully storing classified information			0
meanwhile , @entity14 's lawyers are arguing that the charges against the soldier should be dismissed because of how he was treated while confined at @entity65			0
other prospective witnesses include a military psychiatrist who examined @entity14 at @entity65 , and the former commander of the confinement facility at @entity128 , @entity129 was later moved there , re-evaluated and given a medium - security classification .			0
