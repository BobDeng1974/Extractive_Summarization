@entity2 militants are using huge numbers of @entity5 - made bullets to maim and kill innocent victims across @entity7 and @entity8 , a new survey has revealed			1
a study of more than 1,700 shells fired by @entity11 in the @entity13 regions of the two countries found that 20 per cent were manufactured in @entity5			1
only ammunition from the @entity16 and @entity17 were found in greater numbers in a list of 21 countries ranging from @entity21 and @entity22 to @entity23 and @entity24			1
mark of origin : a survey of ammunition fired by jihadists in @entity7 and @entity8 shows huge numbers of bullets were made in the @entity5 , including these four rifle cartridges which were manufactured at the @entity5 - government owned @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 in 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 in the case of the @entity5 , much of the ammunition was likely seized when the jihadists sent @entity7 forces fleeing during its lightning uprising in june			2
the report found that many of the 323 @entity5 - made cartridges were manufactured between 2000 and 2010 - a period when @entity5 was arming the @entity7 army following the second @entity45			1
@entity46 ( @entity47 ) , which conducted the study , noted in its report : ' is forces appear to have acquired a large part of their current arsenal from stocks seized from , or abandoned by , @entity7 defence and security forces			0
' the @entity5 gifted much of this materiel to @entity7			0
' analysis of the markings on the bottom of the shells found that many had been made at the @entity33 in @entity35			0
the shells comprised mainly 5.56 x 45mm cartridges which are used in @entity5 - supplied @entity66 and @entity67 assault rifles , the report said			1
falling into the wrong hands : a study of more than 1,700 shells fired by @entity11 fighters ( above , file picture ) in the @entity13 regions of @entity8 and @entity7 found that 20 per cent were manufactured in @entity5 the spent shell casings were collected between july 22 and august 15 by a private arms - tracing group in four @entity13 areas of @entity7 and @entity8			1
one of those included the @entity79 where up to 200,000 @entity80 to flee after the terror group stormed the surrounding villages and captured women to be sold as sex slaves			0
the wide range of countries which supplied the bullets indicates just how nebulous the situation is on the ground in the @entity90 , with different factions obtaining weaponry by various means and sources			0
@entity47 , a non-profit research organisation funded by the @entity96 report , said : ' the sample includes ammunition manufactured in 21 countries during a period of nearly 70 years ( 1945 â€“ 2014 )			2
' the variety and age of ammunition used by @entity105 forces indicates a large array of ammunition supply sources , which is attributable to the group having captured materiel during numerous engagements and against various opponents , across @entity7 and @entity8			0
' bullets from the @entity115 federation were much newer - as recent as seven months - suggesting they had been obtained from @entity8 forces , the study said			0
