@entity0 could hardly contain his enthusiasm in the build - up to the first round of the @entity4 on thursday – and it showed as he made a blistering start			1
the world no 1 had taken to social media to express his feelings			1
' just under 3 hours until i hit my first competitive golf shot in 6 weeks			0
to say i ’m excited is an understatement , ' he tweeted , complete with the hashtag : imready			0
out on the course , the world no 1 looked more than ready , as he went round in a fabulous 66 to be tied for the lead with @entity19 @entity18 and lower still further his staggering stroke average on an @entity22 course that most players consider rather difficult			1
as for the other 20 rounds he has had : six 66s , five 67s , two 68s , two 69s and five 71s			0
his start in particular on thursday was mesmerising			2
you might have thought there would be a touch of early rust after an extended period of inactivity but not a bit of it			0
one brilliant shot followed another and he stood on the sixth tee at four under par. not just the race to @entity49 , but this tournament looked as if it was going to be all over bar the shouting long before the 72nd hole as well			1
not getting the fairly routine birdie four at the long 7th stopped the momentum , as a string of prosaic pars followed			0
indeed , @entity0 had to show off a touch of magic around the green at the difficult par four 12th to prevent registering his first dropped shot			1
@entity0 finished the first day tied for the lead with @entity19 @entity18 on 66 the crowd look on as the @entity61 takes his second short on the 12th hole the 25 - year - old returned to the birdie trail by rolling in a nice 12ft putt at the 15th before notching his sixth gain with a similar length putt at the next hole			1
@entity18 is currently 52nd in the world and needs to break into the top 50 by the end of this event to secure a first appearance at the masters			1
he has been on the cusp of making it for the last month but blew a great chance with a poor final round at the @entity79 last week			2
‘ it has been on my mind for a while , ’ he admitted			0
@entity18 made his score with a wonderful finish that saw him birdie four of the last six holes			1
the pair finished one stroke ahead of exciting @entity88 and scot @entity89 , while in - form @entity90 , playing alongside @entity0 , shot a fine 68			2
the 25 - year - old waves to the crowd on the 18th after a brilliant opening round comeback of the day came from @entity96 , who was four over par for the tournament after a terrible first ten holes			2
but he played the next eight in five under for a gutsy 71			0
@entity102 ’s conversation about putting with @entity104 @entity103 on tuesday night produced no immediate dividend as he stumbled to a poor 75 – and his hopes of finishing the season with a first victory in two years are almost certainly over			0
@entity110 @entity109 shot 69 , while @entity111 shot 70			0
northern irishman @entity112 , @entity115 @entity114 and @entity117 champion @entity116 from @entity118 had to settle for rounds of 72			0
@entity18 , seen here missing a birdie on the 18th , enjoyed a strong opening day in @entity49 @entity122 targets strong season - ending display			1

@entity0 shares @entity4 lead with @entity18
world no 1 make blistering start to @entity49 tournament
both @entity18 and @entity0 shoot first round total of 66
