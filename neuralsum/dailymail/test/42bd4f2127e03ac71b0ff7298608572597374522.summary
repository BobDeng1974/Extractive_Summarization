@entity0 was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist			1
@entity8 , a @entity9 based author , believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves @entity0 did not exist			1
he claims there are no contemporary mentions of @entity0 in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived , yet other @entity16 sect leaders from the time do appear			1
instead he insists the disciples of @entity0 were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence			1
historical researcher @entity38 has claimed that @entity0 did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of @entity0 in historical texts by 126 writers during the ‘ time of @entity0 ’ from the first to third centuries			1
he claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of @entity45 to create a figure to worship			1
he says this is surprising despite his ‘ global miracles and alleged worldwide fame			0
’ the 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of @entity0 , when @entity38 says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as @entity0 - but none mention him			1
' when i consider those 126 writers , all of whom should have heard of @entity0 but did not - and @entity68 and @entity69 and @entity70 and @entity30 with a tetralogy of opposing @entity72 , the silence from @entity61 and @entity62 and @entity63 , conflicting @entity65 stories , and so many other mysteries and omissions - i must conclude that @entity0 is a mythical character , ’ he writes			1
‘ " @entity0 " was nothing more than urban ( or desert ) legend , likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed			1
’ in a new book due to be published later this year , he will argue that the figure of @entity0 was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people			1
speaking to @entity85 , he said : ' there is a paradox that @entity0 did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years			1
' or it means he did n't do all these things at all			0
' the first gospel of @entity45 appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray			1
' i believe that @entity45 started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old gods and old traditions were rebooted			0
' @entity45 appears to have been a @entity16 mystery faith			2
' by the time of @entity68 there appears to have been plenty of different " lord 's suppers " as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs			0
' it appears that early @entity45 managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of @entity0			1
' mr @entity8 , whose first book ' nailed : ten @entity118 ' was published in 2010 , believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began @entity45			1
instead he says early @entity123 drew upon the beliefs and rituals of other cults and faiths around in the first century			2
he argues that @entity129 's cult is one such example and had initially been a competitor to the cult of @entity0 before being incorporated into the @entity118 story			2
mr @entity8 says there are inconsistencies in the @entity136 of the @entity118 bible ( pictured above ) that suggest @entity0 was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life the statue of @entity142 ( above ) in @entity143 , @entity144 , is one of many depictions of @entity0 but mr @entity8 says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance mr @entity8 said : ' there is nothing implausible to think that @entity0 was a real person , but i just do n't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all			1
' we also have no mention of @entity0 in other historical texts from the time			1
there were certainly people writing about @entity26 at the time like @entity158			0
' during this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than @entity0 , but all of them managed something @entity0 did not - to make a dent on the historical record			1
' two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did			0
' the earliest mention of @entity0 yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words ' @entity174 , son of @entity177 , brother of @entity0 ' is inscribed			2
the box , which has been dated to @entity180 - several decades after the crucifixion - was seized by the @entity182 and its owner arrested for forgery in 2003			0
although he was later cleared in 2012 , doubts about the authenticity of the inscription remain			0
others have said there could have been several people named @entity191 , whose father was called @entity177 and had a brother called @entity0 living in @entity194 at the time			1
the @entity196 ( above ) is thought by some to be the first mention of @entity0 in an inscription on its side there are three mentions of @entity0 in @entity202 sources which have been used to research the existence of a ' real ' @entity0			2
a @entity0 is mentioned in @entity204 , which was written around 94 ad			2
rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father , @entity0 was actually the son of a successful , middle - class and highly intellectual architect			2
this claim comes from biblical scholar dr @entity209 , who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so - called ' missing years ' of @entity0 ' life , when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest - ranking rabbi in @entity26			2
the radical revision of @entity118 history would suggest that , in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life , @entity0 may have been speaking from experience			2
dr @entity209 has analysed the @entity65 's original @entity222 and @entity223 scriptures to try to establish the truth about @entity0 's background			2
he says a mistranslation of the @entity222 word ' tekton ' to describe the profession of @entity177 , @entity0 's father , is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of @entity0 's character			2
dr @entity209 claims that while ' tekton ' is usually said to mean carpenter , it more accurately means master builder or architect			0
as an architect , @entity177 would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son			0
roman historian @entity240 later mentions @entity0 and his execution with @entity242 in his @entity243 , thought to be written around @entity244			0
both mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution			0
mr @entity248 also takes issue with many of the stories about the crucifixion that stem from the first gospels of @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
he said : ' there are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in @entity26 at the time they are set			0
' @entity29 makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in @entity26			0
' if @entity0 really had been arrested on the eve of @entity265 , they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend			0
' the trial itself violates the rules of @entity16 law - why was he not stoned ? ' what we know about @entity242 also suggests he was someone who would not do what the @entity16 asked him and would often do what they asked him not to			0
' instead @entity29 portrays him as being persuaded by the @entity16 leaders to execute him			0
' mr @entity8 argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of @entity0 as literary devices rather than as a historical account			1
he said : ' there is also no evidence for the tradition that sees @entity284 - an @entity286 rebel and murderer - being released while @entity0 , an innocent , is condemned to death			1
' what this actually seems to be is @entity29 using the story as an allegory for the @entity294 scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for @entity298			0
' mr @entity8 hopes to have his new book ' jesus : mything in @entity301 ' out later this year			0
he added : ' it still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who @entity0 is we get 50 different @entity0 's emerging			0

@entity311 writer @entity8 claims there is no evidence @entity0 existed
the @entity9 based author instead says @entity0 was a literary allegory created by combining old @entity16 stories and rituals along with rival cults
he insists it is time to stop believing in @entity0 as a historical figure
