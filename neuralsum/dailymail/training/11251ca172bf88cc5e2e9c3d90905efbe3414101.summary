by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 04:43 est , 9 january 2014 @entity2 is lapping at front doors			1
boats are bobbing in gardens			1
the locals all acknowledge that you can hardly live next to @entity9 ’s most famous river and then grumble when things get a little soggy			1
but even old @entity13 hands are starting to feel nervous as recent rains and saturated soil continue to see water levels rise and rise			1
@entity9 ’s coast has endured a dramatic pummelling in recent days and a new @entity20 has taken shape in @entity22			1
but some of our most exclusive neighbourhoods are also suffering			1
scenery like this has made the @entity36 a celebrity @entity38 ; sail upstream from @entity39 and the @entity40 and you ’ll find @entity42 a couple of miles beyond @entity44			1
these banks have also produced some of our most popular literature , not least @entity49 and the children ’s classic @entity51			1
but what would @entity51 , @entity52 and the gang have made of the dense brown torrent swirling its way through @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and all those other handsome riverside towns that like to claim they inspired the author , @entity62 ? sir @entity42 ( left ) and sir @entity44 ( right ) are both high - profile residents who live along the river i head for the award - winning @entity66 dedicated to the @entity13 and all its works , including @entity62 ’s masterpiece			1
sadly , the museum , on the edge of @entity58 , is closed for the first time in its history			1
it ’s @entity51 in the @entity75 round here			1
the car park is underwater and the sewage system is backing up			1
‘ we ’re used to a bit of flooding , but this is exceptional , ’ says facilities manager @entity78			1
‘ we had a funeral party booked in for today , but we had to cancel			2
’ looking back to town , it ’s impossible to determine where the @entity13 stops and @entity58 begins			1
the whole area is a huge pond , with the occasional signpost or park bench poking above the surface			2
at nearby @entity93 , the lock is redundant			2
the water level is the same height at both ends and the raging weir beside the lock is now the @entity99 ’ very own white water rapids			2
the @entity102 family have been operating boats in @entity58 since 1870 , but the main office is marooned from the road by several feet of water			2
fifth - generation owner @entity102 , 42 , has erected a gangplank to get to his desk			2
beauty spots such as @entity58 , which helped inspire @entity62 while writing @entity51 , and now suffering the effects of the storms parts of the town are now underwater , including the @entity66 which had to cancel a booking from a funeral party because of the flooding he has plaques on the wall to show various high water marks over the years			1
we are still a few inches short of the disaster that followed the sudden melting of snow in march 1947			2
but this week ’s flooding is on a par with the last major deluge of 2003			1
radio and tv presenter @entity130 , who lives nearby , found the water two inches from his back door yesterday			2
before setting off for his daily show on @entity135 , he shifted what furniture he could upstairs			2
‘ it was like moving house in a couple of hours , ’ he says			2
‘ our local lock - keeper is like the @entity142 is asking him what ’s going to happen next			2
’ a little further upstream , the village of @entity146 could , indeed , accommodate a ship right now			2
nearby @entity148 is home to assorted luminaries ranging from the @entity151 to magician @entity152			1
@entity152 , who raised his house on stilts , is said to be braving out the floods in the town of @entity148 the @entity156 is elsewhere , but mr @entity152 , who fought a long battle with the council to get permission to raise his home on stilts , is braving it out			1
his lane , now impassable , appears to be an additional tributary of the @entity13 , but he is said to be philosophical , as most people in this part of the world are — or were			1
‘ you get used to a certain amount of flooding , of course , but if it gets any higher then people are going to start getting worried , ’ says unflappable @entity148 parish councillor , @entity167 , standing outside the riverside house where her family has lived for nearly 150 years			2
her garden shed is now on the edge of what looks like a very substantial estuary			2
unfortunately for the locals , the @entity180 warns that levels will go on rising for a few more days yet			0
as of last night , the @entity183 , a £ 110 million , seven - mile storm drain built to alleviate flooding around the @entity135 towns of @entity187 and @entity188 , was operating at maximum capacity for the first time in its 14 - year history			0
its sluice gates can not be opened any wider			0
if the water gets much higher than this , it wo n’t just start flooding bits of @entity188 — and perhaps some of chef @entity199 ’s neighbours in nearby @entity200			0
unfortunately for those who live along the @entity13 ' banks , water levels are expected to rise again in two days @entity9 has experienced three weeks of heavy rain and flooding which has seen rivers across the country burst it could even have the bizarre effect of submerging the 2012 @entity211 rowing complex at @entity212			1
just over a bridge outside @entity187 , on a sharp bend in the @entity13 , residents of @entity214 are no longer waiting for the floods to come			1
it ’s too late for that			0
@entity220 and her husband , @entity221 , are the local volunteer flood wardens			0
they have canoes tied up by the front door and are busy checking that all the residents are in one piece			0
‘ one neighbour is on holiday so i ’ve evacuated her chickens to a nice home in @entity187 , ’ says @entity220			0
radio dj @entity130 , who lives near @entity58 , found floodwater two inches from his back door yesterday she has just finished distributing a lorry - load of portable loos to neighbours whose drains have packed up			0
everyone wants to know the latest news about water levels			0
‘ i would n’t mind if this was an act of @entity244 , but it ’s not			0
it ’s a man - made problem , ’ she says , echoing what seems to be the unanimous view round here			0
everyone points out that @entity214 started flooding only when the authorities opened the @entity183 in 2002			0
having carried excess floodwater around @entity188 and @entity187 , the man - made waterway then spits it all back into the @entity13 just ahead of the stretch that runs past @entity214 , @entity253 and historic @entity254			1
the residents are convinced the consequent surge effect is the cause of their problems			0
‘ it ’s as if we are being sacrificed to protect all those expensive properties further upstream , ’ says retired engineer @entity259 , 72 , whose house is now entirely surrounded by water			0
like everyone else , he is angry that the @entity180 has stopped dredging the river			1
‘ bring back the dredgers and do it every year just like they used to , ’ says @entity267 , 81 , shouting at me from her window			0
she ’s lived here since 1954 and says things are worse than ever			0
a few doors away , events manager @entity277 and her husband @entity278 are busy shifting anything moveable upstairs			0
their house sits on the junction of the river and the overspill from the neighbouring lock			1
it ’s weirdly mesmerising to look out and see two furious torrents merging next to their garage			0
a few miles away , by the mighty sluice gates of the @entity183 , i meet the @entity180 ’s man in charge of the flood strategy for this part of the @entity13			1
@entity59 , in @entity297 , is another idyllic town at risk of flooding if storms continue for much longer downstream near @entity304 flooding from the @entity13 has caused devastation to farmland and housing @entity308 explains that the jubilee project has actually saved thousands of people from flooding and that it has not made things any worse for anyone else			1
‘ every time we build a flood defence anywhere , someone will say that they have been sacrificed to help someone else upstream , but it ’s just not true , ’ he says			0
‘ and dredging would make no difference at all			0
what we are seeing is an exceptionally high volume of water — as in 2003 — and i am afraid it still looks set to rise a little more			0
’ not once in the course of two days wandering along the @entity13 do i hear any self - pity			1
no one is demanding compensation			0
everyone accepts that if they want to live in a largely idyllic spot , there must be the occasional downside			1
they ’ll be laughing again come the summer			0
but for now , it ’s time for bottled water , portable loos , torchlight and stoicism			0
standing next to the bungalow that was once the home of band leader @entity346 , @entity214 resident @entity343 points out another famous local landmark			0
it is the late @entity349 ’s cabin cruiser — wisecrack — straining on its moorings against the swirling waters			0
even @entity354 , i suspect , would be pushed to get a joke out of this .			0

parts of @entity9 are now experiencing third week of rain
rivers across the country have burst their banks and *destroyed* homes
as @entity13 swells now some of @entity9 *'s* *poshest* houses are at risk
