the @entity0 is preparing to court - martial a female nuclear missile launch officer on drug and obstruction - of - justice charges following an investigation that led to the disclosure of a separate exam - cheating scandal that implicated nearly 100 nuclear officers			1
second lieutenant @entity9 , 25 , of the @entity10 at @entity11 , @entity12 , was the first missileer , as launch officers are called , known to have been charged since the drug investigation was made public in january			1
the investigation came to light on the same day that defense secretary @entity19 visited the headquarters of the @entity0 's land - based nuclear missile force			1
@entity9 is a missile launch officer at @entity11 , @entity12 , home to a third of the @entity0 's @entity25 missile capability four missileers were subjects of the drug investigation , three were at @entity11 and one at @entity30 in @entity31			1
the twin disclosures of alleged exam cheating and illegal drug use accelerated a wave of embarrassing news about the nuclear missile corps , which has been beset with discipline problems , low morale , leadership lapses and resource shortages			2
last month , @entity42 announced plans for top - to - bottom changes in how the force is managed and operated			2
ten days later he resigned , although @entity0 officials said they were confident the reforms will move ahead			2
@entity9 was charged with illegal drug use and obstructing the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) probe by dyeing her hair to ' alter the results of potential hair - follicle drug tests , ' according to @entity55 , a spokesman at @entity11			1
he would not elaborate on her alleged actions or the tests			0
he said her court - martial was scheduled for january 21			1
efforts to reach @entity9 for comment on tuesday were unsuccessful			0
the nuclear missile corps has been beset by embarrassing news over the past year , with defense secretary @entity42 promising a shake - up of management and operations ten days before he resigned the investigation began in august 2013 at @entity68 in @entity69			1
when investigators examined the cellphones of two airmen at @entity68 they found text messages to or from 11 other @entity0 officers at several other air bases			1
the text messages detailed ' specific illegal drug use that included synthetic drugs , ecstasy and amphetamines , ' according to a report released in march that looked mainly at missileers ' exam cheating but also traced a connection between the drug and cheating issues			1
two of the 11 officers were assigned to @entity89 ; investigators determined that both had used personal cellphones to discuss illegal drug activity as well as answers to routine proficiency tests taken by all missileers , according to the march investigative report			2
that investigation focused on the exam cheating , whereas the drug probe was done separately as a criminal inquiry by the @entity50 , which has not publicly announced its results			1
eventually the number of @entity89 missileers implicated in the drug probe grew to three			0
the @entity0 concluded that the exam cheating was confined to missileers at @entity11			1
disciplinary action for the alleged cheating is being handled separately from the drug cases , although the @entity0 has said that three officers at @entity89 who were suspected of illegal drug activities also were alleged to have shared classified exam materials			2
on tuesday , air force secretary @entity113 said the @entity50 criminal probe is complete			0
' we 've made a big point about accountability , ' @entity115 said			0
' standards are standards , and when people fail in integrity , service and excellence there are appropriate accountability measures			0
' we 've made a big point of that and that 's true across the @entity0 and it has been , of course , particularly true this past year in the @entity132 community			0
' as a missileer @entity9 was trained to operate the @entity25 missile , which is armed with a nuclear warhead and stands ready for launch on short notice from an underground silo that is electronically linked to a launch control center , also underground , where two missileers are on duty around the clock			2
because of the sensitive nature of the job , with its many classified procedures and potential for costly mistakes , any allegation of drug use by missileers is concerning			0
a @entity152 report last year on workplace stresses for missileers and others in the nuclear missile corps found some suffering ' burnout			0
' it also found an elevated rate of behavioral issues , including domestic violence			0
@entity9 's @entity10 at @entity11 operates 150 of the @entity0 's 450 @entity25 intercontinental ballistic missiles , or icbms			1
the other 300 are evenly divided between @entity164 in @entity165 and @entity30 in @entity31			0
the @entity0 also operates a fleet of nuclear - capable bomber aircraft .			0
