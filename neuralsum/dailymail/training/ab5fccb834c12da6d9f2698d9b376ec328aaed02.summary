by @entity0 @entity2 former police community support officer @entity1 told an @entity4 court today that smuggling drugs into the country was the ' most stupid decision of my life			1
' the 43 - year - old former @entity10 with @entity11 had previously pleaded guilty to trafficking crystal meth , often referred to as ' ice ' , worth more than Â£ 3,000 into @entity14 , @entity4 's second largest city , in april last year			1
miss @entity1 blamed her ' state of mind ' at the time which led to her bringing the 3lbs of ice into the country , resulting in her arrest when police raided her three - star hotel @entity14 hotel			1
but today her defence team argued that despite her admission of the crime - smuggling the drugs through customs in her underwear - the case had not been proved because of the duress she had suffered			2
the team was referring to miss @entity1 's claim that an @entity51 friend in the @entity53 city of @entity54 , where she had been living after leaving the @entity2 , had threatened her , telling her : ' i 'm @entity56			1
' today the defence team said the threat , made by a man called ' @entity63 ' , meant that @entity31 could not be deemed fully responsible by law			0
family support : @entity1 's mother and brother observe proceedings during an earlier court hearing apology : @entity1 told the court she regretted her actions and said they were the result of ' the most stupid decision of my life ' standing before the three judges in a red prisoner 's bib , miss @entity1 then spoke in her own defence			1
she apologised to the court for the crime , explaining that her state of mind at the time had led to ' the most stupid decision of my life and one i regret the most			1
' much of the six hour hearing was taken up with complex legal argument and when the court eventually adjourned , miss @entity1 was told she would continue to be remanded in custody until the next hearing on january 15			1
it is then that the prosecution will have the opportunity of responding to the defence plea for leniency			0
despite the prosecution having earlier asked for @entity31 to be sent to prison for 16 years , there is no guarantee that she will receive that sentence			0
observers said there was still a chance that she could be sentenced to death , as happened with @entity2 grandmother @entity108 , from @entity109 , who is now on death row in a @entity113 jail , despite the prosecution asking for a 15 - year jail sentence			0
@entity1 waits for her hearing to commence as she paces around in a jail cell with fellow female prisoners @entity1 is visited by her mother and brother in her cell before entering the courtroom for her hearing armed police escort @entity1 to her hearing in @entity14 earlier this month miss @entity1 has shown open remorse since her arrest			2
she said in an earlier @entity128 message to friends : ' your support means the world to me			0
i 'm so very sorry i 've disappointed you all			0
' her court appearance today comes just four days after police from @entity54 raided homes in the city of @entity139 and seized three tons of ice and made 182 arrests			0
police said a massive drug operation had been operating in @entity139 , a notorious drug - producing area			0
while there is no suggestion that the drug operation was linked to miss @entity1 's agreement to act as a drug mule on the flight from @entity54 to @entity4 , police said that in the past three years , @entity139 - 370 miles from @entity54 - had provided one third of the crystel meth nationwide			2
it has not been revealed whether the drugs seized in the @entity139 raid were for export or domestic consumption .			2

@entity1 , 43 , had previously served with @entity11
she blamed decision to smuggle drugs on her ' state of mind '
@entity1 *insisted* a @entity56 friend had forced her to smuggle the drugs
