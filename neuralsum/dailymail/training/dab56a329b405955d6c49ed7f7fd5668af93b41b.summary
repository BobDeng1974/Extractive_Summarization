not even the distraction of a spectator proposing to his girlfriend could prevent top seed @entity3 from easing into the last 16 of the @entity4 on saturday			1
the romantic fan popped the question after the second set of @entity3 's third - round match with @entity9 and received not only a ' yes ' , but a massive cheer from the rest of the crowd on @entity13 and applause from @entity3 himself			1
by that stage @entity3 had weathered the storm and was two sets ahead , the world number one crucially winning a tie - break in the opening set after failing to convert any of his six break points			2
' @entity9 is a top - 10 player , he has played in the final stages of grand slams and big tournaments			1
he has big power in his game			0
' every time i had an opportunity for the break he came up with a service winner or an ace and obviously it was frustrating but i had to keep it together and the difference was made in the first set when i won the tie - break			2
' @entity9 was favourite to win that tie - break when an ace took him 5 - 3 ahead with another serve to come , but a terrible double fault let @entity3 off the hook and the @entity30 eventually took his fourth set point to win it 10 - 8			1
@entity3 claimed an early break in the second set and crucially saved three break points in the next game with a hat - trick of aces			2
from then on there was only ever going to be one winner and @entity3 celebrated his 7 - 6 ( 10/8 ) 6 - 3 6 - 4 win by getting the crowd to sing happy birthday to his mother @entity71			1
next up for the four - time champion is @entity74 's @entity73 , who won a big - serving battle with @entity77 @entity76 that unsurprisingly featured tie - breaks in the first two sets and a total of 54 aces			2
four - time champion @entity3 beat @entity9 ( pictured ) , who could not get to the fourth round djokovic hugs @entity9 after beating the @entity86 at the @entity4 in the third round defending champion @entity88 had earlier continued his far more unobtrusive progress in the championship , beating @entity92 's @entity91 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 4 to maintain his record of not having dropped a set			1
the fourth seed sent down nine aces and won 90 per cent of points behind his first serve to set up a clash with @entity31 's @entity99 in the fourth round			2
@entity99 was a similarly comfortable winner over @entity102 's @entity101 , beating the world number 60 6 - 2 6 - 4 6 - 4 to reach the last 16 and equal his best performance in a grand slam			1
' i 'm feeling good since the beginning of the tournament , ' @entity88 said			0
' for sure i 'm not the focus on the tournament because there 's @entity3 , @entity112 ( @entity113 ) coming back from injury , @entity115 ( @entity116 ) also just lost , there 's ( @entity118 ) @entity119 , ( @entity121 ) @entity120 still playing			2
' for sure i 'm not the focus			0
for me does n't matter			0
i 'm happy the way i 'm playing			0
to get to the second week again , it 's great			0
so far everything is good for me			0
' @entity125 continued his charmed progress through the draw with victory over @entity130 's @entity129 , the 12th seed winning 7 - 6 ( 8/6 ) 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7/3 ) to set up a last - 16 contest with eighth seed @entity133			1
the no 1 - ranked @entity3 was able to see off the @entity86 and get to the fourth round for his ninth year djokovic supporters cheer his win after his third round match against @entity9 of @entity31 in @entity32 @entity99 saved three match points in his first - round match with wild card @entity142 , eventually winning the fifth set 10 - 8 , and saved another in the second round against @entity147			1
@entity99 was trailing 4 - 6 4 - 6 0 - 4 when @entity147 fell ill but won the third - set tie - break and was leading 4 - 0 in the fourth set when his unfortunate opponent retired			1
@entity99 acknowledged he was making the most of his good fortune , adding : ' it gives you the chance			0
it gives you the opportunity to play today because i was already out with @entity147 and @entity142 in the first round , no ? ' today when i was out there playing , i thought i have to be pleased for that opportunity , so try your best			2
i think today finally i play some of my best tennis			0
losing with @entity142 or @entity147 i would n't have the chance , so i feel very pleased			0
' it 's true i have a couple of tough matches			0
today was also a tough one , but it was straight sets , which is really good for my fitness condition			0
i feel ready to play the rest of the week			0
' @entity133 continued the theme of one - sided matches by beating @entity175 's @entity174 - who knocked out home favourite @entity176 in the previous round - 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 3			1
