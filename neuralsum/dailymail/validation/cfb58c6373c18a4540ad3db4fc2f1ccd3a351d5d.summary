method of choice : double murderer @entity2 has chosen to die by firing squad it is a macabre choice to make - and almost unique to some inmates on @entity8 's death row : would you be injected with toxic chemicals , or shot in the heart ? but , amid cries of outrage against the southwestern state bringing death by firing quad back into law , almost half of those due to die that way have picked the punishment themselves			1
@entity2 , who slit the throats of his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 , is one of three who has opted to die by the bullet			1
two others in @entity8 's eight - strong death row have made the same choice , the @entity32 reported - though it is not clear who they are			1
the recent change in @entity8 's execution law revived the firing squad as a back - up method , in case no lethal injection drugs are available it was outlawed in 2004 , before which time inmates such as @entity43 had been able to choose between the two			1
even while firing squads were banned , a legal technicality meant previous decisions were still valid			2
the last was carried out in 2010			0
in practice , @entity8 has no doses of lethal injection , and no way to acquire more			1
that situation means anybody the state executes is likely to be put before a firing squad - five marksmen with .30 - caliber @entity59 rifles - whatever their preference			1
the state is not due to kill anybody for several years yet , so a new source could be found - though many drugs manufacturers now refuse to do business with governments that carry out capital punishment			1
human rights organizations criticize the method as a barbaric throwback to the days of the @entity71 - the same charges which led to the scrapping in the first place			2
he said : ' those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state			2
' we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued			1
others : two other inmates have requested death by firing squad			1
above are ( left to right ) @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 death row : anybody sentenced to death before 2004 has a choice of execution methods			2
pictured above ( left to right ) are @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 ' however , when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant , enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch			0
' refusal : @entity133 , pictured , has asked for lethal injection - but may be killed by firing squad anyway if none can be found the move follows a series of high - profile botched executions around the @entity141 in 2014 and 2015 , many due to concerns about the efficacy of lethal injection drugs			1
proponents of the punishment tout the speed of firing squads - provided some of the five bullets hit the heart , death can come in little longer than a minute			2
lethal injections have in some cases dragged on for almost half an hour			0
the last firing squad death in @entity8 , and the @entity141 , was that of @entity83 in 2010			1
a @entity157 report said that he told a @entity8 judge ' i would like the firing squad , please ' a few weeks before his execution date			1
he explained his preference more than a decade earlier , in an interview with the @entity165			0
he told the paper : ' i guess it 's my @entity168 heritage			0
' ' i like the firing squad			1
it 's so much easier ... and there 's no mistakes			0
' as per his wishes , the marksmen opened fire at a 12:15am on june 18 , 2010 , @entity173 reported			0
at 12:17am , he was declared dead			0
the prisoner is seated in a chair that is set up in front of a wood panel and in between stacked sandbags that keep the bullets from ricocheting around the room			0
a target is pinned over the inmate 's heart			0
shooters aim for the chest rather than the head because it 's a bigger target and usually allows for a faster death			0
the prisoner is offered a two - minute window to offer final words			2
in 1977 , @entity197 used that chance to say ' let 's do this ! ' before he died			0
five shooters set up about 25 feet from the chair , with their .30 - caliber @entity59 rifles pointing through slots in a wall			2
assuming they hit their target , the heart ruptures and the prisoner dies quickly from blood loss			0
weapon : @entity8 's marksmen fire the fatal rounds from a .30 - caliber @entity59 rifle , similar to the one above the gunmen are chosen from a pool of volunteer officers , with priority given to those from the area where the crime happened			0
thus far there have always been more volunteers than necessary			0
the shooters ' identities are kept anonymous , and one of their rifles is loaded with a blank round so nobody knows which officer killed the inmate			2
unlike lethal injections , death by firing squad leaves some of an inmates ' organs - such as the eyes , kidneys and liver - unspoilt for donation , so long as they are not hit by stray bullets			1

state recent brought firing squad back onto the law books
was *reinstated* as second choice amid *shortage* of lethal injection drugs
before 2004 , inmates could choose - and three went for firing squad
one is @entity2 , who killed his sister - in - law and her baby in 1984
firing squad sees prisoner face five marksman with rifles from 25ft away
