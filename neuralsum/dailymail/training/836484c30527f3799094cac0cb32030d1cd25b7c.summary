but that ’s no reason to leave quail ’s egg croustades off the menu , according to @entity12			1
in the @entity16 , the online magazine of @entity12 family business @entity15 , editor @entity12 has given her tips on how to organise a ‘ fun ’ first birthday celebration			1
@entity12 's suggestion for quail 's egg croustades is also included in her book celebrate she includes the recipe for the fiddly finger - food – garnished with @entity25 sauce and pan-fried crispy pancetta – but helpfully recommends that ‘ to keep expense down ’ you should limit canapes to two per person			1
and her wisdom does n’t end there			0
‘ most of your guests will probably be crawling , ’ the @entity35 ’s sister points out			0
‘ create a baby - proof play zone with plenty of cushions			2
’ the 29 - year - old has written a party planning book , @entity44 , which includes the very same recipe for croustades			1
she was recently appointed as a columnist for @entity49 magazine			0
the april issue of @entity49 will feature @entity12 's first column the magazine features the recipe alongside an advert for the book urging readers to ‘ buy signed copies now ! ' it also suggests making your offspring ’s first milestone memorable by decorating the room with balloons because ‘ babies all love balloons ! ’ miss @entity12 also advises : ‘ play some nursery and party music in the background ... or @entity69 is always a winner			1
’ and the grown - ups are not forgotten , either : ‘ set chairs around the area for parents to relax and watch ’			0
doubtless none of this will whet the appetite of the shoppers who have flooded @entity49 ’s @entity78 and @entity79 accounts with complaints after @entity12 replaced @entity81 , 71 , whose cookery books have sold 21 million copies , as a columnist in the supermarket ’s magazine			1

for the record , quail ’s eggs are about a quarter of the size of hen ’s eggs - and a dozen quail ’s eggs costs £ 2.35 from @entity49 .			0
