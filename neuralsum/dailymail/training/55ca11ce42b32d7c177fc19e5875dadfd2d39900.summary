in a moving interview with @entity109 , @entity53 says : ‘ we ’re not the ones that have done something wrong here			0
it ’s the person who ’s gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family			0
’ @entity87 says : ‘ when it ’s a special occasion , when you should be your happiest and @entity16 ’s not there , that ’s when it really hits home			1
’ his wife adds : ‘ it ’s when you have big family occasions really			0
that ’s it is n’t it ? family occasion and you have n’t got your complete family			0
’ detective chief inspector @entity15 , the senior investigating officer , will announce ‘ a revelation moment ’ in @entity9 ’s £ 5million investigation			1

emotional : an interview with @entity53 and @entity87 will also be shown during the special episode of @entity38 tonight witnesses reported the sightings to @entity14 police , but little importance was placed on them at the time			0
now @entity9 says tracing the man in the two e-fits is ‘ one of the main priorities for the investigation ’ after scrutinising the time frame when the abduction could have taken place			1
they are the first to be issued in relation to the @entity161 - funded inquiry into the case			0
detectives say their timeline and version of events surrounding @entity16 ’s disappearance has ‘ significantly changed ’ , making the two witness sightings far more significant than previously thought			1
officers are keeping an open mind as to whether more than one person was responsible for the abduction , which they think may be linked to a series of break - ins at the resort			0
disappeared : @entity16 went missing from the @entity14 holiday apartment in 2007 when she was three years old mr @entity15 said : ‘ whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation , tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us			1
we have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of @entity16 ’s disappearance			2
‘ this is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well , who we are equally keen to trace			0
these people were seen on the day of @entity16 ’s disappearance and the days leading up to it			2
’ the focus of the hunt for @entity16 , from @entity199 , @entity200 , who would now be ten years old , will move to @entity202 this week when her parents are expected to travel there to make a tv appeal			1

publicity for that programme says detectives are now going on the ‘ offensive ’ , with inquiries focusing on @entity202			2
it adds : ‘ this is the reason why @entity211 will show sketches of two men who appear to speak @entity142 and who have so far been paid little or no importance			0
’ the e-fits will also be shown on @entity226 as the two ‘ @entity142 speakers ’ may have been @entity228 – the accents sound similar			0
tonight ’s @entity38 reconstruction will give the most detailed sequence ever made public of the events that led to @entity16 ’s disappearance			2
detectives believe her kidnappers may have been lurking in or near the @entity238 ’ holiday apartment as her father went to check on his children			1
earlier inquiries focused on the period after that , but they now believe the 45 minutes before that could hold the key			0
mr @entity15 said : ‘ our work has significantly changed the accepted version of events and it has allowed us to highlight very specific appeal points			0
i hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together , it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward			0
