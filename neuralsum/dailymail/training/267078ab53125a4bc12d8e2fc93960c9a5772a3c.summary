heavy drinking was the cause of ten million visits to @entity5 hospitals last year , figures have revealed			1
in the first all - encompassing analysis of the toll of alcohol on the health service , experts put the total cost of treatment at £ 2.8billion			1
charities last night said that the country ’s booze culture is putting an ‘ intolerable strain ’ on the @entity16			2
but the latest research – with outpatient admissions and @entity36 trips also taken into account – puts the true impact of drinking at ten times higher			1
the analysis also calculates the long - term impact of heavy drinking , such as heart disease , stroke and cancer			2
the charity @entity47 , which examined official figures provided by the @entity16 , found that alcohol caused 9.96million visits to @entity5 hospitals in 2012/13			1
that included 6.3million visits to @entity36 , 992,000 overnight admissions to inpatient wards , and 2.67million day visits to outpatient wards			1
hospital staff report that @entity36 units are turning into war zones , particularly at weekends			2
health minister @entity61 has called for a £ 50 fine for those who ‘ gratuitously ’ consume too much alcohol and then abuse health staff when they are taken to hospital			2
mr @entity61 said in august : ‘ there ’s an issue with youngsters drinking too much			0
it ’s having a massive impact on people ’s health and the consequences for them further down the line are enormous			0
’ but @entity47 ’s report shows that while @entity36 admissions are a huge source of problems , long - term drinking is also placing a burden on the @entity16 because it causes diseases which are expensive to treat			1
its research reveals that 47 per cent of all admissions for head and neck cancer – including tumours of the mouth and throat – are linked to drinking			0
just over 13 per cent cases of breast cancer are also attributed to alcohol			0
toll : more than 6million of the visits were to @entity36 units and a million included overnight stays in hospital some 15 per cent of gastrointestinal cancers , 13.5 per cent of hypertensive disease such as heart disease and stroke , and 23.4 per cent of epilepsy admissions are rooted in heavy drinking			1
according to the charity ’s @entity104 , men aged 55 to 75 were the most likely to be admitted to hospital due to alcohol misuse			2
and some 9.6million people are now drinking in excess of @entity111 guidelines , including 2.4million who are classed as high risk			0
those rated high - risk drink more than eight units of alcohol a day – about three pints of beer or four large glasses of wine			0
while @entity36 admissions accounted for the vast majority of visits , inpatient admissions cost far more , making up two - thirds of the total cost burden of £ 2.8billion			1
@entity47 chief executive @entity125 said : ‘ the @entity16 is now facing an intolerable strain from alcohol - related illnesses			1
‘ this is not just from readily identifiable causes such as @entity36 visits and admissions for liver disease , but from a significant number of other conditions in which alcohol plays a major , but often under - appreciated part			1
‘ we urgently need action to prevent alcohol misuse			0
the most effective of which is for the government to implement a minimum unit price , which has the potential to save the economy millions , and most importantly save lives			0
’ government agency @entity146 said alcohol harm was going in the wrong direction as it repeated calls for minimum pricing to be introduced			0
@entity153 , director of the alcohol , drugs and tobacco division at @entity146 , said : ‘ alcohol harms are unacceptably high and much of this is preventable			0
‘ @entity146 will continue to promote the evidence for a minimum unit price on alcohol and other measures to reduce harm , raise awareness of the harms to those drinking at risk , as well as promoting good effective local treatment and specialist hospital services for all who need them			0
