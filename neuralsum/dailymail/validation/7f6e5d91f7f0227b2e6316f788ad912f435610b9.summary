reaching up to close my kitchen blind , i catch sight of my neighbour in her garden			2
she raises her hand to wave , then stops			2
rooted to the spot , horror etched on her face , she looks as though she ’ll never get over the shock			1
but i ’m not surprised			2
my face is the stuff of nightmares			1
covered in a cotton mask and wrapped in @entity15 ( right ) , i look just like @entity16			2
i ’m swaddled like this because , according to a new bestselling book , the @entity19 , steaming your face by covering it in @entity15 is the secret to beautifully smooth and rejuvenated skin			1
a new bestselling book , the @entity19 , says that steaming your face and covering it in clingfilm is the key to rejuvenated skin @entity31 women are renowned for their beautiful skin but , until now , no book in @entity34 has revealed the secrets of their beauty routines			1
now , we can discover the joys of massage to tone the muscles of the face and natural remedies for wrinkles , sagging , oiliness , pimples and blackheads — including a step - by - step guide to the clingfilm mask			1
the idea is that the heat created by your breath and body warmth will encourage pores to open , so that the moisture from any water , creams or serums applied to the face will soak into the deeper layers of the skin , boosting collagen			1
‘ moisture content is the most important factor in a rejuvenated complexion , ’ says the book ’s author @entity64 , a celebrity beauty guru in @entity31			1
‘ if skin is hydrated , it will look younger , firmer and fresher			1
’ she promises that her mask , which consists of water , followed by hydrating lotion , then serum — will give me an instant youth boost			2
if i follow it to the letter , i can wave goodbye to @entity81 , as water is the secret weapon in the war on ageing			2
surprisingly enough , the idea does have medical backing			2
@entity87 ( pictured ) gave the bizarre technique a try and wrapped her own face in clingfilm to see what the results were like ‘ we use clingfilm in severe cases of psoriasis to encourage cream to work at a deeper dermal level , ’ says dr @entity93 , director of the @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96			1
dr @entity93 says healing cream is applied to the skin , then wrapped in clingfilm before being left overnight in a process called @entity108			1
the heat from the body encourages pores to open and the cream to absorb , rather than just sitting on the skin ’s surface			1
in the past year , my complexion has begun to look grey and tired			2
at 46 , the lines around my eyes and mouth are becoming pronounced			0
so if wrapping my face in @entity15 helps me retain some semblance of youth , i ’m willing to give it a try			1
@entity87 ( pictured ) bought cosmetic facial mask sheets and first soaked them in water before applying @entity126 hydrating fluid to the mask having bought a cosmetic facial mask sheet — a thin piece of cotton in the shape of a face with the eyes , nostrils and lips cut out — ( £ 2 for 40 , @entity137 ) , i set to work			1
first , i soak the weird - looking facial mask in water and wring it out			0
then , i liberally apply @entity126 hydrating fluid ( £ 27.05 , narscosmetics.co.uk ) to the mask , creating a thin layer of product over its surface			0
‘ hydrating fluid is a moisturising agent , ’ says dr @entity144 , a cosmetic medicine specialist from @entity96			0
‘ it contains humectant , a substance that attracts and retains water			0
it gathers water on and below the skin ’s surface and retains it , plumping out fine lines and smoothing the complexion			1
’ the book also recommends that you do a quick lymphatic drainage massage to clear toxins and reduce puffiness with the mask drenched , i pat it on to my face , where it sticks like a damp cloth			1
though it ’s strange , it feels pleasantly cool and less slimy and greasy than i had imagined			0
now to wrap my face in clingfilm			1
this feels horrid and , despite having created breathing holes around my nose and mouth , i feel claustrophobic			0
yet within minutes , the clingfilm is doing its job			0
beneath the mask , my skin feels smooth and slippery and i ’m clouding up from the humidity			1
i can feel the heat created by my breath			0
it ’s not as hot as a sauna , but it ’s several degrees warmer inside the mask than out			0
after 20 minutes , i whip off the mask as instructed			0
already , my skin looks smoother and plumper			1
now it ’s time to rub in moisturising cream			0
i opt for @entity185 ( £ 36 , @entity186 ) , though @entity64 says any cream will do because it ’s how it ’s applied that matters			0
after taking off the mask , @entity87 ( pictured ) tries to follow follow @entity64 ’s instructions on the art of water massage by spritzing water along the ‘ muscles of facial expression ’ she recommends a quick lymphatic drainage massage			1
massaging lymph glands behind the earlobes , around the collarbone and under the armpits helps stimulate lymphatic flow , thus clearing toxins , she says			0
this , in turn , will help reduce puffiness in the face and lead to a clearer complexion			1
after slathering on the cream , it ’s time to steam my face again — only this time , i use a wet towel heated in the microwave for 30 seconds			1
beneath my warm towel , it ’s dark and restful			0
i can almost feel the moisturiser seeping into my pores and , i hope , filling out the lines across my face			1
but the calm does n’t last long			0
once the towel comes off , i ’m busy trying to follow @entity64 ’s instructions on the art of water massage			0
using a spray bottle , i attempt to follow her diagram , spritzing along the ‘ muscles of facial expression ’ — along the forehead in a zig - zag from right to left , clockwise around the eyes and mouth , three short upward strokes along the cheeks and , finally , clockwise around my whole face			2
by the time i ’ve finished , i ’m soaking wet , with water dribbling down my face and plopping forlornly off the end of my chin			2
@entity87 ( pictured ) was pleasantly surprised by the results of the clingfilm facial and says she thought her complexion looked instantly softer onto the final leg of this marathon , and it ’s time to massage serum into my face			1
i use skin - @entity247 serum ( £ 40 , @entity137 ) , a strong , hydrating product with hyaluronic acid — an agent that encourages skin to attract and retain water			2
then i massage it into my damp skin , concentrating on smoothing out the lines around my mouth and on my forehead , and pressing it into my face with upward strokes			1
and , finally , i ’m done			0
the facial took half - an - hour , but it felt much longer — perhaps because i was struggling to read the instructions through the clingfilm			0
nevertheless , i ’m pleasantly surprised			0
my complexion looks instantly softer , its greyish tinge replaced by a rosy hue , and the lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished			0
‘ you wo n’t get lasting rejuvenating effects from this facial because it wo n’t increase collagen , which is the key to younger skin			1
but your face will look plumped out and smoother for 24 hours , ’ says dr @entity144			2
however , @entity64 insists her facial has a cumulative effect , so if you repeat it three times a week for three months , you can knock off a decade			0
the day after , i meet a friend for lunch			0
she demands to know if i ’ve had a collagen filler			0
‘ you ’ve done something and do n’t tell me it ’s just a good night ’s sleep , ’ she says			0
with a result like that , i ’m willing to mummify myself every evening for the rest of the year .			0

we *'d* all like younger , fresher looking skin but it *'s* not always easy
