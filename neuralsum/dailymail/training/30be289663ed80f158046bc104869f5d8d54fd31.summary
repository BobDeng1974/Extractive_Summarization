addressing the defendants , mr @entity46 said : ' in short , by your offending you have let down your colleagues , you have damaged patient trust and you have undermined the quality of care for the elderly and vulnerable at @entity54			1
' the three women were charged following a @entity57 inquiry into the hospital after a student nurse acted as a whistleblower			1
the women would physically and verbally abuse patients , often telling them to shut up , as well as handling them in a rough and aggressive manner , police said			1
@entity4 , of @entity10 , @entity65 , of @entity31 ; and @entity12 , of @entity27 , were responsible for looking after elderly female patients with various physical and mental conditions including dementia			1
june @entity69 , who is wheelchair bound , was the only patient still alive or well enough to come to court to give evidence against them			2
the other patients are too ill or suffer from dementia			2

the incidents occurred between february 27 to april 30 last year on @entity8 at @entity9 in @entity11 ' i lost faith in my gp , the ambulance service and hospitals in general			1
' ms @entity89 discharged herself from the hospital following the assault and was in a state of distress when she had to return to @entity54 for further treatment			2
' i wanted to die , ' she said			2
' i thought why could n't i have a heart attack and end it			2
' a police inquiry into alleged offences committed against a health campaigner who highlighted failings at a scandal - plagued hospital has been unable to identify those responsible			2
@entity104 said it had finished detailed inquiries into offences reported by @entity107 the @entity45 founder @entity108 , whose mother @entity109 died at @entity110 in 2007			2
ms @entity108 , who battled to expose hundreds of needless deaths at the hospital , moved out of @entity112 earlier this year following the desecration of her mother 's grave			2
the campaigner believes the threats made against her by some local people , which also included on - line abuse , were politically - motivated			2
officers from @entity104 , which will reopen its inquiry if new evidence comes to light , are still appealing for information			2
in a statement issued by the force , a police spokesman said : ' after seeing media reports about alleged incidents , we immediately contacted ms @entity108 to get further information			2
' detectives were made aware of a number of issues , including damage to flowers and vases at her mother 's grave			2
' clearly , such offences are completely unacceptable			2
' we began an investigation which involved taking witness statements , carrying out inquiries at incident locations and examining @entity148 footage			0
' we 've now finished our detailed inquiries and , at this stage , we have not been able to recover evidence which could help us identify offenders			0
' a public inquiry into ' appalling ' failings at the @entity155 , which published its final report in february , found that hundreds of patients were mistreated at the trust between 2005 and 2009			1
previous reports into the @entity155 estimated that as many as 1,200 patients may have died needlessly while in its care			0
administrators recommended last month that the @entity155 should be dissolved and some services at @entity110 should be cut			1
in a statement , ms @entity108 said she was disappointed people had seen fit to abuse her for attempting to bring to light problems in the @entity45			0
' one of the biggest problems at @entity170 is still the denial about what happened and that is what 's led to me being abused , ' she said			0
@entity4 was found guilty of holding a bed sheet over 87 - year - old @entity178 ’s head and telling her she was dead			1
she pushed ms @entity178 ’s breasts in another incident and forcefully twisted her mouth which was both ' demeaning and completely unnecessary '			0
@entity4 shouted at 88 - year - old patient @entity182 to force her to sit in a chair and slapped @entity184 , 92 , after cleaning her , the hearing was told			1
@entity65 was found guilty of one count of neglecting patient @entity39 , while @entity12 was found guilty of one charge of neglect and one charge of assault by beating june @entity69			1
jurors heard the healthcare assistants were arrested after a student nurse @entity194 whistleblew on them following a placement on the ward last @entity197			0
@entity198 , prosecuting , said : ' the conduct complained of simply had no place on any ward			0
it can not be justified			0
' @entity204 @entity203 heard 92 - year - old @entity205 was admitted to the ward on march 27 , 2012 , suffering from septic arthritis in her left knee			0
mr @entity198 told jurors : ' she was bed bound and extremely frail and it is the expert ’s professional opinion that she suffered from dementia and was n’t able to make her own decisions			0
' during the time she was on @entity8 she was under the care of @entity4			1
' @entity194 described @entity4 as being extremely rough with @entity205			1
' in the course of one encounter @entity194 noted that when miss @entity205 ’s bandages were removed miss @entity205 said ‘ mind my leg			0
’ ' after that @entity4 grabbed her left knee with both her hands and pushed it towards @entity194			1
' this caused her to scream in pain and turn pale before falling silent			0
that , we say , is what constitutes ill treatment for that count			0
' opening the case , mr @entity198 said : ' the prosecution case is they variously ill treated patients either by positive actions towards them or by failing to look after them when they should have			0
' the defendants worked on a geriatric ward and were trusted to provide the most basic tasks			1
' there is little doubt some of these would have been unpleasant and that elderly and demented patients could be obstructive			0
' however , this factor only serves to highlight the vulnerability of these patients and outline the fact that providing care professionally was the responsibility of each defendant			0
' an entitlement for proper care should not be a matter of chance given at the whim of the carer			0
' the court heard the ward has since closed down following a @entity57 investigation into alleged abuse			0
@entity259 , which runs the hospital , apologised to patients following the verdicts and stressed it had a ' zero tolerance approach ' to any form of neglect or ill - treatment			1

' there can be no place under any circumstances for such behaviour in our trust or in the wider @entity45			0
' it added that following an internal disciplinary investigation all three women had their contracts of employment terminated			0
healthcare worker @entity4 placed a sheet over one patient 's head and told her she was dead it added : ' we take a zero tolerance approach to any form of neglect or ill - treatment of our patients and applaud the student nurses who showed courage and integrity in raising the alarm			1
' it is the duty of every member of staff to report such behaviour and we will actively encourage and support this through our whistleblowing policy which is made clear to all staff on day one of their employment with the @entity155 , with ongoing reminders to existing staff during regular statutory and mandatory training			0
' moreover , we will take action against any member of staff who turns a blind eye , or fails to take immediate and appropriate action , if they witness any form of abuse or negligence			0
' @entity259 was issued with three formal warnings last week after inspectors found ' unsafe ' conditions at @entity54 including filthy maternity wards and water placed out of the reach of elderly patients			1
the trust had ' failed to protect the safety and welfare of patients ' and must now make ' urgent improvements ' following unannounced inspections in may and june , the @entity334 ( @entity334 ) said			0
following the sentencing , detective sergeant @entity341 , from the @entity57 's @entity342 in @entity343 , said : ' these three women had a responsibility for the welfare of those who were under their care			0
' the public and families of these elderly patients have a right to expect that they will be treated with respect and looked after in an appropriate manner			0
' @entity12 , @entity65 and @entity4 let everyone down and it 's right that they have been found guilty at court			1
