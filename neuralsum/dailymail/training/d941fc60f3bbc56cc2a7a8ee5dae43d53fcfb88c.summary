by @entity0 published : 00:12 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 00:12 est , 10 january 2014 a @entity3 court has ruled that the identities of seven anonymous reviewers who criticized a local carpet cleaning business must be revealed			1
in a decision that will strike fear in the hearts of all anonymous online trolls , an @entity8 judge ruled on tuesday that @entity13 must comply with the demand of @entity16 's attorneys and hand over the names of the reviewers			1
@entity8 - based @entity19 was the subject of several negative reviews on the site by anonymous authors - who hadeed claims were not real customers of his business			1
bad reviews : business owner @entity16 ( left , with @entity3 governor @entity29 ) wants to sue anonymous reviewers of his carpet cleaning business for defamation if he is correct and the customers are not genuine , @entity13 's @entity34 will have been violated , and the comments will not be protected under the @entity37			1
the case began in 2012 when several negative reviews were left on @entity41 's @entity13 page , some claiming the company swindled customers , overcharging hundreds of dollars above the quoted price , while others said their carpets ended up looking worse than before they were cleaned			1
@entity16 could find no record that the reviewers were actual customers and sued the authors of seven negative reviews and subpoenaed @entity13 for their identities			1
according to the @entity53 , @entity13 refused several times and was help in contempt of court			0
on tuesday , the @entity57 agreed two to one , that @entity13 must identify the anonymous reviewers			0
@entity13 's @entity34 requires that reviewers must have been a customer of a business to leave a review			2
bad opinion : the company 's @entity13 page has seven negative anonymous reviews from 2012 which @entity16 says can not be matched to any customer the company does not require users to register with their full name , but does record the ip address of each review posted			2
' the @entity3 statute makes the judge a gatekeeper to decide whether or not thereâ € ™ s a common sense reason for someone in our position to get this information , ' @entity74 , a lawyer at the @entity76 firm @entity75 who represent @entity16 , told the @entity87			0
' in order for someone like @entity16 to find out who these people are , he has to explain his case , and if he can convince the judge that there might be a real lawsuit against this person , the judge can then say , " yes , you can get this information , " ' said @entity100			0
if the negative reviews were written by people who were never customers of @entity16 , he will sue for defamation			1
small business : the company cleans and repairs carpets and rugs the non-profit advocacy group @entity108 that represents @entity13 says reviewers should not have to reveal their identities when expressing opinions protected by the @entity37 and that @entity16 should have to at least prove that the reviews were false before the identities are handed over			1
@entity13 's lawyers say @entity16 did not meet nationwide standards necessary to uncover the anonymous users , but the court disagreed			2
' @entity13 said that all the posts had different ip addresses , but how many ip addresses does one person have between all their devices ? ' said @entity124 € ™ s attorney , @entity74 , to the @entity87			0
' it would be easy to create a number of different fake accounts			0
' in a 25 - page majority opinion , judge @entity128 said , ' generally , a @entity13 review is entitled to @entity37 protection because it is a personâ € ™ s opinion about a business that they patronized			2
' the anonymous speaker has the right to express himself on the internet without the fear that his veil of anonymity will be pierced for no other reason than because another person disagrees with him , ' judge @entity128 wrote			0
however , the court said that first amendment rights do not cover deliberately false statements and agreed that @entity16 provided sufficient reason to believe the users may not have been customers of @entity19 .			0
