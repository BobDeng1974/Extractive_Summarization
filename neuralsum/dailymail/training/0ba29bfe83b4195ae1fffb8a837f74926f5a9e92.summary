a 79 - year - old mother will be kicked out of her £ 1.2million home - after a judge ruled that she can not share it with the grown - up son she hates			1
@entity5 changed the locks on her home in @entity8 , @entity9 in a bid to keep out her electrician son , @entity11			1
but judge @entity12 ruled she had ' unlawfully excluded ' him from the house he had mostly paid for and which he half owned			1
court fight : @entity5 ( right ) changed the locks on her home in @entity8 , @entity9 in a bid to keep out her electrician son , @entity11 ( left ) the judge considered splitting the house in half so that mrs @entity5 could live on the ground floor and her son above her			1
but the breakdown of their relationship was so ' irretrievable ' that forcing them to live in this way was bound to cause trouble , she said			0
in the end , the only solution was to force mrs @entity5 to sell the home where she had lived for almost 40 years and split the profits with her son			1
the enforced move was ' bound to lead to suffering ' for mrs @entity5 , the court heard			2
but her tenacity in court showed she was ' well able to stand up for herself '			0
with her son 's help , she had bought the house under the ' right to buy ' scheme in 2001 for just £ 250,000 , making close to a 500 per cent profit since , the court heard			1
and judge @entity45 said she was sure the pensioner ' would be able to cope ' with moving to ' a cheaper part of @entity9 '			0
mrs @entity5 moved into the house as a council tenant in 1976 and only managed to buy it when her son , now in his 50s , agreed to put in £ 155,000 of his own money			1
it had been his home since he was 14 but , in november 2012 , his mother changed the locks and told him to stay away - even preventing him from collecting his belongings			2
the terraced home in @entity59 , south west @entity9 , cost just £ 250,000 in 2001 she insisted she had never agreed to a 50/50 ownership split and told @entity62 : ' i do n't want him there			1
have i no rights as a person ? ' after death yes , but during my life i do n't want other people living there '			0
mrs @entity5 even launched a counter-claim for damages against her son , accusing him and his wife , @entity73 , of targeting her with a ' phone call harassment ' campaign			2
but the judge said mrs @entity5 's central harassment allegation was ' probably concocted ' because she was ' so angry ' with her son			2
he had made an ' unpleasant tactical attempt ' to question his mother 's mental health and was ' less than wholly reliable as a witness '			0
but his mother had ' told the court substantially more untruths than he did ' and her account of events had been ' thoroughly undermined ' , said the judge			0
there was , she ruled , no truth in mrs @entity5 's claim that she did not agree to a 50/50 split or that she had been put under pressure to sign documents she did not understand			2
she had ' exercised her free will ' and had gained far more than her son from the spectacularly successful property investment , the court heard			0
he had sold his own home to raise the £ 155,000 and his mother ' knew full well ' that the intention from the outset was to provide a home for both for them			2
the judge roundly rejected mrs @entity5 's claim that , for years , her son had only visited the house to collect his mail , walk the dog , and to ' bring women back '			1
although he moved to @entity109 , @entity110 , in 2006 , he had treated the @entity8 property as his home right up until the day his mother changed the locks			2
the judge said the only explanation for the unlawful ' lock out ' of her son was that ' mrs @entity5 wanted the whole house for herself '			1
he had told her he wanted to spend more time there , but ' she wanted to live in the house alone '			0
mr @entity119 told the judge he had no desire to see his mother , who has nothing to live on but her pension , forced out of her home			0
he only wanted to retrieve his possessions and to sleep in the house for part of the week whilst he was working in @entity9			0
1976 : mrs @entity5 moves in to home in @entity8 , @entity9 as a council tenant 2001 : purchases house for £ 250,000 with help of her son @entity11 who paid £ 155,000 2012 : mrs @entity5 changes the locks and tells her son to stay away october 2014 : both appear at @entity62 after the dispute ends in legal action december 2014 : judge orders that mrs @entity5 must sell the £ 1.2million property judge @entity45 said she had thought about a structural division of ground floor from first floor as a possible solution to the impasse			1
but she was convinced that that was bound to lead to ' continuing disputes ' between the warring mother and son			0
she also considered allowing mrs @entity5 to stay in the house until she died , but ruled that that would hardly be fair on her son			1
such an ' irretrievable breakdown ' in their relationship meant a sale of the house was the only realistic option			0
the judge said the pensioner 's conduct during the case revealed her as a woman ' well able to stand up for herself '			0
she concluded : ' although the loss of her long term home is bound to lead to suffering on mrs @entity5 's part , i am sure that she would be able to cope with the process of sale and of purchase of another property , even if it has to be in a cheaper part of @entity9 '			1
the judge laid down a time table for estate agents to visit the house - as well as removers to retrieve mr @entity119 's furniture and other belongings - in preparation for a sale .			0

@entity5 , 79 , will be forced to sell home in @entity8 , @entity9
judge rules she and son @entity11 would not be able to live there together
ruled that pensioner ' unlawfully excluded ' son from house he had mostly paid for and which he half owned
she bought home in 2001 after son put in £ 155,000 of his own money
its value has since *soared* from a £ 250,000 ' right to buy ' to £ 1.2million
court is told that the breakdown of their relationship was ' irretrievable '
mrs @entity5 changed locks to the house in 2012 and told him to stay away
