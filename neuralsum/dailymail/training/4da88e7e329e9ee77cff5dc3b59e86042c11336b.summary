@entity0 has asked for more time to stamp his own identity on the @entity3 side after insisting he was not to blame for the transfer strategy which left them short of defenders			1
the @entity7 is grateful not to have been fired in the wake of last weekend ’s 8 - 0 drubbing at @entity10 and the @entity3 take on @entity11 just one point outside of the bottom three			1
@entity0 marked one year in the job earlier this month but believes he is still some way from making the team his own			1
@entity3 boss @entity0 was embarrassed by his side 's 8 - 0 defeat against @entity10 ‘ it takes time , no doubt , ’ he said			1
‘ managers love to have time but it ’s also unrealistic			1
we ca n’t always be asking for time			1
‘ do i need time to change things ? yes , i do			2
the most difficult thing to change is mentality			2
a player at 27 or 28 is n’t going to improve his ability , but he might have been in a certain mental situation because every season involved in relegation			1
it takes time to change that and results			2
the two coming together , i hope i ’ve got the time			2
’ @entity0 says the loss at @entity10 – which equalled a club record – was not helped by only having four fit defenders			1
and the @entity3 boss does not take responsibility for the club ’s failure to bring in the personnel he asked for during the summer			1
‘ i wanted seven defenders and we started the season with six , ’ said @entity0 , having this week signed former @entity48 defender @entity47 on a free transfer			1
‘ that ’s true , but now we have seven			2
i did n’t make the decision to have six , but that ’s life			2
@entity0 - reacting to the defeat last weekend - has pleaded for more time at the @entity57 @entity0 has brought in @entity48 defender @entity47 in hope that the 34 - year - old can bolster his defence ‘ i accept it and i get on with it			1
which means i ’m not going to tell you i ’m happy or not happy			2
i get on with it because that is where we are			0
‘ we were looking for certain players , we were looking for @entity71 but he did n’t come			0
but i ’m not going to lie , we did n’t sign a replacement for @entity71			0
’ meanwhile , midfielder @entity75 has revealed the desperation of the squad to put right the humiliation of last weekend			0
‘ i said to my girlfriend on sunday morning , “ i wish we had a game this afternoon to put it right ” , ’ he said			0
‘ you just need another game and we need everyone to pull together as a club			0
we know the supporters will back us			0
we let them down on saturday but we are looking to bounce back and start repairing that damage			0
‘ what happened last week we ’d like to think was a one - off			1
a lot of people are hurting			0
there has been a lot of discussion since then and this week has been difficult			0
‘ we finished the game on saturday and did n’t meet up again until monday			0
that 24 hours felt like a few days for most of us			0
we came back and had time to think about it , we put our point across where we thought we could improve			0
