by @entity0 published : 03:04 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 6 august 2013 a mother has been fined £ 400 because her son missed a day of school nearly nine years ago because he had severe headaches as a result of an undiagnosed brain tumour			1
@entity7 , 51 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was given just seven days to pay the fine which was issued because her 24 - year - old son @entity11 was off sick when he was a teenager in november 2004			1
she claims she had informed the school that her son , who had to take several sick days in the months before his diagnosis , was ill but she was fined for his ' truancy ' anyway			1
upset : the fine has been upsetting for mrs @entity7 as it has also brought back bad memories of her son 's battle with cancer mr @entity11 , who now has three children of his own , collapsed with seizures in january 2005 and was on a life support machine for three days at @entity24			1
he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent numerous operations			2
mrs @entity7 was taken to court by @entity28 later that year after education bosses claimed she was not doing enough to get her son back to lessons at @entity31 in @entity32 after his treatment			1
the case was thrown out by magistrates and mrs @entity7 assumed that was the end of the matter			1
however , she has now been issued with a letter by debt recovery firm @entity39 , who were acting on instruction from @entity43 , ordering her to pay a £ 405 court fine within seven days			0
if the mother - of - three does not pay the fine she has been threatened with bailiffs coming to her house and the sale of her possessions by public auction			0
a spokesman for the council claimed the fine related to a case when mrs @entity7 was found guilty in her absence of allowing her son to be truant			1
but she claims she was only aware of the later case which she attended and that she ' had never heard anything ' about the earlier hearing or the fine until last week			0
demand : mrs @entity7 was sent a letter from @entity61 , acting on the instruction of @entity63 , asking for the £ 405 fine she said : ' when @entity11 first started getting headaches i first thought he was a typical teenager blagging to try to get time off school but he was in tears with the pain			1
' we thought it was migraines and the doctors put it down to migraines too			2
' i called the school every time @entity11 was sick so i do n't know why this has been put down as an unauthorised absence			1
' i would have thought i would have got a letter about this from the court , but i have never heard anything about this fine before until the letter landed on my doorstep last week			0
' mr @entity11 was in hospital for five weeks after he collapsed and then spent two years undergoing treatment			1
doctors can not operate on the benign tumour in his brain and he will have to take medication and attend regular check - ups for the rest of his life			1
since receiving the debt collection order this week , mrs @entity7 said she has been unable to sleep as it has brought back memories of the difficult time			2
' it ’s eight years ( since @entity11 was in hospital ) now and we get hit by this from absolutely nowhere			2
it ’s not just the financial stress of being told we ’ve got to find this money but it brings all those awful memories back up again			0
' as far as we ’re concerned there ’s no fine to be paid , but even if there was it seems bizarre that after hearing nothing for eight years we suddenly get a letter saying we ’ve got to pay this money within seven days or face further action			0
' fine : @entity7 ( left ) has been fined because her son @entity11 ( right ) missed school when he was suddenly hospitalised with a brain tumour in 2005			1
he is now 24 and a father of three the @entity43 and @entity120 , which is responsible for the collection of fines ordered by courts in the @entity124 , said today it was looking into whether the order had been made in error			2
a spokesman said : ' we are investigating this incident as a matter of urgency			0
the family have been advised no further action will be taken until our investigation has concluded			0
' parents of children who persistently truant can be fined , ordered to do community service or even jailed			2
the numbers of parents prosecuted has risen from under 4,000 in 2005 to 12,800 in 2011 as the government has cracked down on truancy			0
this year the government introduced on - the - spot fines of £ 60 - rising to £ 120 if they fail to pay on time - to parents whose children miss school			0
@entity147 figures suggest around 43,000 pupils fail to attend school on any given day			0
around 7 per cent of schoolchildren , the equivalent of 450,000 pupils , missed around a month of lessons in 2010 - 11 .			0

@entity7 , *53* , has been fined for her son 's absence in november 2004

two months later @entity11 was on life support after doctors discovered tumour
