acute pain : @entity1 contracted @entity2 whilst on a walking holiday in the @entity4 when @entity1 developed pain in her hands and wrists in autumn 2011 , she thought she might be developing arthritis that was being aggravated by the cold			1
in fact , @entity1 , 37 , who is a vet , was displaying the first signs of a disease picked up on her summer holidays - in the @entity14 - and her case was so severe that she ended up in a wheelchair , unable to work			1
' the stabbing , burning pain became excruciating quite quickly , spreading to my toes , knees , back , jaw , neck and shoulders and then shooting down my limbs , ' recalls @entity1			1
' it was intermittent , but the worst pain i 've ever experienced - there were occasions when i thought i 'd black out			2
' she also suffered tingling and loss of sensation			2
@entity1 , who describes herself as a ' healthy , outdoorsy type ' , was so debilitated that her gp referred her to a neurologist			1
after an mri scan and various tests ruled out conditions such as multiple sclerosis , @entity1 was finally diagnosed with unexplained neuralgia , or nerve pain , four months after her symptoms first began			1
by now she could n't operate at the animal hospital where she practises without plunging her arms into buckets of ice afterwards to ease the pain			2
then a colleague mentioned that his sister who 'd had similar symptoms had been diagnosed with @entity2			1
' i 'd been on a walking holiday in the @entity4 about a month before the symptoms appeared and remembered seeing leaflets about @entity2 in the cabin i stayed in , ' says @entity1 , who lives in @entity56 , @entity57			1
' but i had n't paid much attention - i knew it was passed on by ticks and , as a vet , i remove them from animals all the time			1
i felt my training would have alerted me if they carried a real risk for humans			1
' but lyme disease is a risk , affecting increasing numbers as milder winters and damper summers provide perfect conditions for ticks to thrive , according to the charity @entity74			1
official figures suggest 3,000 people a year in @entity14 are affected by the disease , although with symptoms similar to so many other conditions , such as fibromyalgia - a long - term condition causing pain all over the body - multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome , the charity estimates many people may have been misdiagnosed			1
the disease begins with a bite from an infected tick			2
the insect injects an anaesthetic , so the bite ca n't be felt , as well as the @entity90 bacteria into the blood			0
in two - thirds of cases , this causes a distinctive bullseye - shaped red rash that spreads outwards , usually from the site of the bite			0
but it does n't hurt and may go unnoticed - ticks can be as small as poppy seeds , and often climb up into the groin , armpit or scalp , where any redness may also go unnoticed			2
the victim may not even be particularly ill or may have only minor , flu - like symptoms that soon pass			0
however in some cases - particularly if they 're not promptly diagnosed and treated - the disease can @entity1 then went to see a private specialist in @entity2 , who recommended doxycycline antibiotics			1
@entity112 produced from deer tick bite leading to @entity2 : the illness is affecting increasing numbers of people in the @entity14 ' i responded beautifully , ' she says			1
' within three weeks the pain had gone and i was back operating on sick animals			2
life returned to normal - i even fell in love			0
' however , @entity1 relapsed last summer			1
' i did n't think it possible , but the pain was 100 times worse , ' she says			0
' i could n't brush my hair or lift a kettle			0
' @entity127 , my boyfriend of just three months at that point , had to feed me and dress me			2
and the one time i did manage to make it downstairs from my sick bed , i could n't get back upstairs again			0
' @entity1 was signed off from work and had to use a wheelchair			1
' my job is my vocation so it was just awful , ' she says			0
' there was a general fatigue and brain fog so dense i could n't even remember the names of those closest to me			0
i was in such agony i wanted to die			0
' dr @entity140 , a consultant microbiologist who works with @entity142 testing for @entity2 , explains : ' if the @entity2 organism is n't defeated by the immune system in the early stages , it can spread to other sites - particularly the nervous system and joint tissue , including the brain , causing inflammation that can lead to tingling , @entity152 's palsy ( partial facial paralysis ) or even , possibly , low - grade meningitis			1
' if the disease is treated at this stage , the patient will usually make a quick recovery , although damage caused by the infection , such as tissue scarring or deterioration of nerve function , can take time to resolve			2
' this can take from six weeks to six months , and occasionally even longer			1
dr @entity140 is sceptical about patients relapsing , however , saying some take a long time to recover or get re-infected			2
' the key is to get it early , ' he advises			0
' so our job is to increase awareness , among @entity175 as well as the public , to ensure patients with @entity2 are recognised , diagnosed and treated as soon as possible			1
' but clearly prevention is also key			0
an estimated 10 per cent of ticks are thought to carry the @entity2 bacteria			1
they are usually found living in long grass or undergrowth and are therefore common in woods , moors , parks and even gardens where there is also wildlife to feed on , explains @entity190 , chair of @entity74			0
' they attach themselves to passing animals such as sheep , rabbits , mice , cats , dogs and even birds , ' she adds			0
' in humans , they can grab on to the outside of clothing and find their way onto skin under a waistband or up a sleeve and tend to keep going until they find somewhere moist and warm			0
' this means it 's important to keep covered outdoors in areas of vegetation where there is also wildlife			0
' and not just in the countryside , ' @entity190 warns			0
' @entity216 , badgers and foxes are common in urban areas and there are deer in increasing numbers in some public parks			1
' she recommends checking yourself , and children , for the tiny black specks , including around the hairline , then carefully detaching any found with a cotton thread wound around the tick close to the skin and pulled upwards , or a special tick remover available from vets or the @entity74 website			0
' it 's vital to avoid leaving behind the head , which can still then infect , ' she says			0
if infection has occurred , symptoms typically take from a couple of days to a month to manifest			0
' flu - like symptoms developing after you 've been in a potentially tick - infested environment should flash warning signs - particularly in summer and definitely if accompanied by a red rash , ' says @entity190			0
the test for @entity2 involves a blood test to screen for antibodies and usually another to confirm the results			1
results may come back negative , as antibodies can take weeks to develop , so the test may need to be repeated			2
treatment is with antibiotics , which may also need to be repeated			0
after seeking help from specialists in the @entity256 - where @entity2 is more common - and persuading her gp to follow their advice on medication , @entity1 began a second course of antibiotics last december which has reduced her pain by three - quarters			1
she is still on medication , but has less need for her wheelchair			2
' it takes two days in bed to get my energy back after having a bath , ' she says			0
' but i feel much better and hope i will soon be back at work			2

@entity1 got @entity2 from after a walking holiday in @entity276
it was so painful she was signed off from work and had to use a wheelchair
it can take from six weeks to six months to fully recover from the disease
lyme disease , carried by ticks , is affecting increasing numbers of @entity14
