@entity0 , 73 , died from a minor fall after being wrongly prescribed a mixture of medication which prevented his blood from clotting a dementia sufferer bled to death after a minor fall because doctors failed to notice that his medication prevented his blood from clotting , an inquest has heard			1
retired gardener @entity0 , 73 , was wrongly prescribed a combination of drugs which , when taken together , reduced his body 's ability to clot blood			1
but a ' systemic failing ' meant doctors at @entity20 , @entity21 , ' ignored ' the problem on two occasions , only taking a proper blood sample when it was ' too late '			1
the 73 - year - old had been taken to hospital after falling from a chair while at @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30			2
at an inquest into his death , coroner @entity31 said mr @entity0 would not have died as a result of the fall if doctors had recognised the problem caused by the particular mixture of drugs			1
he said there had been opportunities for hospital staff to notice the abnormality , but that they failed to take a proper blood sample in time			2
he has now vowed to write to bosses at the hospital trust , warning that action should be taken			0
recording a verdict of accidental death , mr @entity31 said : ' i will be sending a report to the chief executive of @entity20 pointing out the problems with regards to the taking of blood samples and their analysis , and indicate to them that appropriate action should be taken to resolve what i believe to be a systemic failing			1
' speaking after the inquest , mr @entity0 's 63 - year - old wife @entity63 said she felt ' very let down ' at what she had heard			1
she said : ' it was not just one slip up			0
it was the doctor with the wrong medication and it was twice with the bloods			0
' nobody is perfect and they seemed such a good crowd at the hospital , and i could n't fault anything , but i feel very let down by what i heard at the inquest			2
' the court heard how mr @entity0 , who had gone to the home in april , had been prescribed warfarin following a stroke			1
he was later prescribed miconazole , an anti-fungal agent , for cellulitis			0
but the inquest heard it had been a ' personal failing ' by mr @entity0 's doctor to prescribe two medicines which , when taken together , increases the anticoagulant effect			1
this means mr @entity0 's body 's ability to blood clot was severely affected			1
speaking after the inquest , mr @entity0 's 63 - year - old wife @entity63 said she felt ' very let down ' at what she had heard after falling from the chair in august this year , mr @entity0 was taken to hospital			1
the inquest heard how there were no physical signs of massive abdominal bleeding			2
but an international normalisation ratio ( @entity104 ) check would have told doctors mr @entity0 's blood was not clotting properly , the court was told			1
the coroner heard how doctors tried to collect blood on two consecutive days in order to take a reading			2
but , when they could not collect enough blood , they ' ignored it rather than go back and take another blood sample ' , the court heard			0
mr @entity31 said : ' that seems to me a systemic failure rather than an individual failure			0
' there is no system in place that says if you take out a blood sample and it 's insufficient then , rather than simply ignore it , you should go back and take another			0
mr @entity0 died at the @entity20 , @entity21 ( pictured ) in august , after doctors failed to take sufficient blood samples on two occasions ' one can not speculate as to whether , in fact , had the inr been capable of being collected on the first occasion and vitamin k provided , the outcome would have been different			1
' whatever chance he had he lost by the failure to do that			0
' when they finally managed to test mr @entity0 's inr at the third attempt , medics discovered it had rocketed from a usual 2.6 to more than 12			2
mr @entity0 was given treatment but his heart stopped on monday , august 18 , three days after being taken to hospital			1
mr @entity31 said : ' he simply bled to death internally			0
' the relatively minor fall would have itself not have caused any significant injury had it not been for the fact blood - clotting agents were such that - once there was a minor bleeding from a minor blood vessel - it simply did not stop			2
' there was an opportunity to deal with that at the @entity20 because on admission they took a blood sample to do the full blood count , but there was insufficient taken to collect the @entity104			2
' the retired gardener was staying at @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity30 ( pictured ) when he fell from a chair and was taken to hospital he added : ' in terms of the prescribing of miconazole , that seems to me is a personal failing			2
there is plenty of literature out there that doctors ought to know			0
it seems to me that is where the problem started			0
' mr @entity0 's wife , @entity63 , who lives in @entity176 , told the court that mr @entity0 had developed dementia after a stroke			1
he had gone into the care home after two previous short stays for respite care			0
in a statement , care assistant @entity183 told the court she saw mr @entity0 ' slide off a chair ' onto a carpeted floor			1
he was given painkillers after complaining of pain in his left groin , but had no visible injuries , she added			0
mrs @entity193 met her husband when he moved over to @entity195 in the 1970s			0
they were married for 38 years and had three children : @entity199 , 41 , @entity198 , 34 , and @entity200 , 40			0
she said : ' he was a keen cyclist			0
he was very fit and active until his stroke			0
it was a shock because my husband was a very intelligent man			0
' it 's like losing him twice because he went in the home in april and i had to learn to be without him then too			0
i feel guilty because i wonder if he had been at home , would he have died ? ' dr @entity212 , acting medical director at @entity20 , said : ' we offer our condolences to mr @entity0 's family			1
' the trust is currently undertaking an investigation into the circumstances around mr @entity0 's care and treatment so we are unable to comment at this time			1
' dr @entity221 , the consultant who is carrying out the internal investigation , has offered to meet with mr @entity0 's family again to ensure that we keep them fully informed during this investigation and the subsequent findings			1

@entity0 , 73 , fell off chair at @entity228 , @entity30
he then died from internal bleeding while at the @entity20
mr @entity0 had been prescribed drugs which stopped his blood clotting
doctors failed to recognise problem , only taking tests when it was ' too late '
