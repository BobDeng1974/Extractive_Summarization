by @entity0 published : 02:33 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 19:36 est , 4 march 2014 @entity2 has been omitted from @entity4 's squad to face @entity5 in a friendly for punching opponent @entity7 during @entity10 's @entity9 feisty clash with @entity11			1
as the pair waited for a ball to arrive in the penalty area , @entity12 swung a right arm from behind @entity7 , planting one flush on the @entity20 forward 's jaw			0
the vicious incident was n't picked up by referee @entity22 , but was captured by television cameras and the 30 - year - old midfielder has since been dropped by @entity4 for a breach of manager @entity27 's ethical code			2
ouch : @entity2 lands a punch on @entity11 opponent @entity29 during the @entity9 clash rocked : as @entity7 waits for the ball , @entity12 lands flush on his chin fiery : @entity12 's conduct went unnoticed but he was handed a retrospective three - game ban @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity37 ( @entity36 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) ; @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , @entity47 ( @entity39 ) , @entity43 ( @entity39 ) , @entity42 ( @entity39 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 ) ; @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity57 ( @entity39 ) , @entity56 ( @entity55 ) , @entity62 ( @entity41 ) , @entity63 ( @entity54 ) , @entity64 ( @entity39 ) , @entity65 ( @entity41 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , @entity68 ( @entity10 ) , @entity69 ( @entity36 ) , @entity70 ( @entity67 ) , @entity71 ( @entity52 ) , @entity72 ( @entity39 ) @entity10 talisman @entity12 's problems worsened as he was handed a retrospective three - game ban , after the @entity75 deemed the punch to be ' deliberate '			1
the sanction , which rules @entity12 out of crunch clashes against @entity52 , @entity79 and @entity80 , is likely to hinder @entity10 's chances of catching leaders @entity39 , who hold an 11 - point lead at the top after beating @entity11 2 - 0 on sunday			0
remarkably , @entity12 's was n't the only punching incident during the heated goalless draw			0
@entity11 's @entity88 was also handed a three - game domestic ban for punching @entity10 counterpart @entity91			2
@entity27 , who was at the unveiling of @entity4 's new strip in @entity94 among @entity4 's squad are @entity97 bad boy currently on loan at @entity72 and @entity59 's @entity58 , who started sunday 's @entity100 final against @entity101 on the bench			0
hard line : @entity27 ( left ) decided not to select @entity12 for breaching a code of ethics new look : from left , @entity4 stars @entity65 , @entity37 , @entity64 , @entity42 , @entity108 , @entity27 and @entity38 unveil the country 's new kit on monday you as well ! @entity11 's @entity88 ( left ) was also banned for punching @entity91 underhand : @entity88 planted a left uppercut into the ribs of the @entity10 man , who writhed in pain afterwards			1

@entity2 gets three - game ban for ' deliberate ' punch on @entity11 forward
@entity11 *defender* @entity88 also banned retrospectively for punching
@entity27 's @entity4 squad without @entity12 and @entity124
