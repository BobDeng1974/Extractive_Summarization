@entity0 sent out a warning to their @entity3 rivals with a convincing 3 - 1 win over @entity5 at the @entity6			1
@entity7 scored twice for the hosts , while @entity9 added a third 23 seconds after being introduced as a second - half substitute			1
@entity12 ' side gained a late consolation when @entity14 put through his own net			2
here , @entity17 's @entity16 gives his opinion on the performance of the players on monday evening			0
all smiles : @entity9 is congratulated by his team - mates after having an immediate impact as a substitute @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) - team average 6.8 @entity25 - 7 maybe could have caught a few that he punched but solid and took few risks			1
@entity14 - 6.5 in his first game back after the @entity29 look as solid as ever despite late own goal			2
reads the game so well			0
@entity32 - 6.5 nearly let in @entity33 early on but dominant after that and led his side by example			2
@entity37 - 6 lucky not to be booked when @entity38 outstripped him but better than last season			0
@entity41 - 8 best i ’ve seen him play in a few years			2
his pace was essential in his battle with @entity38			0
outstanding : @entity41 produced one of his best displays in years at left - back for @entity49 's side @entity50 - 6 never strayed too far from his central zone			1
provided a solid defensive buttress			0
@entity54 - 6.5 relatively quiet by his high standards			0
i ’d have liked to see a bit more from him			0
not at his best : @entity54 was uncharacteristically quiet in central midfield for the reigning champions @entity63 - 7 struggled in the first half but much more of an impact when he moved centrally			2
@entity67 - 6.5 quiet in the first half but came to life in the second with good movement off the line			0
@entity7 - 8 @entity73 pure instinct for his first and a sublime flick for his second			1
opener : @entity7 watches as his fierce strike rips into the back of @entity81 's net in first half main man : @entity7 has started the season brilliantly for @entity0 , and he was the stand - out player on monday night @entity85 - 6.5 not as exciting as @entity0 ’s other hot - shots but led the line well until he came off			1
@entity88 @entity9 - 7 looked bright during his time on the pitch and took his goal brilliantly 23 seconds after coming on			1
clinical : @entity9 needed just 23 seconds to leave his mark on the game - a firm finish past @entity81 @entity96 - 6 @entity97 - 6 manager @entity49 - 8 went with two strikers and it paid off and you have to applaud that attacking instinct			1
perfect performance : city boss @entity49 's decision to play a 4 - 4 - 2 against @entity5 paid off @entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) - team average 6.3 @entity81 - 5.5 wo n’t be happy with the goals he let in , particularly @entity9 ’s side - foot at the post			1
@entity110 - 6 better at right back , looked quicker than at the @entity29 but @entity0 were too strong			1
@entity111 - 6.5 if he wants to be the defensive leader he needs to get the back four working as a unit			0
off the pace : @entity5 's summer signing from @entity116 , @entity111 , left , battles with @entity85 at fault : @entity119 was thrown into the starting line - up by @entity12 but was culpable for first goal @entity122 - 6 solid in the first half when @entity5 were better , but could not keep @entity0 at bay			1
@entity119 - 5.5 hesitation at this level is punished and he had his pocket picked by @entity7 for the goal			1
@entity129 - 6 was busy in tight areas , moved the ball quickly , and linked well with @entity132			0
@entity132 - 6.5 started attacks well with @entity5 in charge but gradually had less of an impact			2
@entity136 - 6.5 made some good , intelligent runs from deep but overrun in midfield late on			0
@entity139 - 6.5 was good going forward but sometimes left the inexperienced @entity119 exposed			2
@entity140 - 7 showed quick feet and breezed past @entity32 in the first half as if he was n’t there			0
@entity38 - 7 his movement off the ball was good but they did n’t get it to him enough in the middle			0
bad night at the office : @entity140 failed to find the back of the net at the @entity6 against his former club @entity88 @entity152 - 6.5 prompted @entity5 's consolation goal , forcing @entity14 to bundle in from close range late in the second half			1
@entity156 - 6 @entity157 - 6 late consolation : @entity14 puts the ball past @entity25 under pressure from @entity152 manager @entity12 - 6 @entity5 started well but getting nailed by the @entity162 this early will affect confidence			1
referee @entity166 - 8 no real controversial moments to deal with , though he might have booked @entity37 for bringing down @entity38			0
let the game flow and is clearly respected by the players despite his young age .			0

@entity7 's sublime showing in front of goal fired @entity0 to *victory*
striker scored either side of the break , with @entity181 *international* @entity9 also on the *scoresheet* for the reigning @entity3 champions
@entity41 *excelled* at left - back as @entity49 's side eased to a win
latest @entity5 signing @entity119 was thrown in at the deep end by @entity12 but was culpable for @entity0 's opening goal at the @entity6
