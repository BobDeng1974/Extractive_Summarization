@entity0 is urging @entity1 to take a leaf out of @entity4 's book as they look to bounce back from their self - inflicted wounds			1
the @entity1 head for @entity8 on monday evening having endured a nightmare fortnight , scoring three own goals in an 8 - 0 defeat at @entity12 and then handing @entity13 a 2 - 0 victory on a plate at the @entity16 last weekend , courtesy of individual errors from @entity19 and @entity20			1
as a result , @entity22 's men have slipped into the @entity25 's bottom three , rekindling memories of last season 's desperate fight for survival			2
@entity1 players look dejected as they fell to a 8 - 0 humiliation at @entity12 earlier this month @entity0 says @entity1 can look to rivals @entity4 for inspiration to turn season around @entity33 celebrates scoring for @entity4 during the 2 - 0 victory at the @entity35 on wednesday in the meantime , arch - rivals @entity4 have lifted themselves out of the drop zone with victories over @entity39 and @entity40 , and booked themselves a place in the @entity43 quarter - finals following an unexpected win at @entity45			1
@entity0 said : ' it can change so quickly - look at @entity4 up the road			1
' we 're looking to bounce back on monday , it 's a massive game for us			1
' we ca n't get too carried away with a couple of bad results			2
we 've all been here that many times			2
we 've got to cut the errors out			2
you cut them out and you suddenly make teams beat you			0
' but it 's a hard thing to do			0
' @entity1 did just that last season when , having gone into the final six games of the season seemingly doomed to life in the @entity65 , they managed to draw at @entity45 and win at both @entity66 and @entity67 as they collected 13 of the last 18 points on offer to stay up			1
@entity1 's @entity20 - who made errors in the defeats to @entity13 and @entity12 - could be dropped while there may be trepidation on the terraces over the club 's current plight , there is a belief within the dressing room that the picture is far from as bleak as that which has been painted , and @entity0 insists the last two games have to be put into perspective			1
he said : ' results are the big thing but as players , you tend to judge by the performance			0
we were on the pitch and you feel the way the game was going			0
' we went down to @entity95 and got beaten 1 - 0 and everything you read in the paper was n't great , but we actually dominated them from start to finish			1
they could n't get two passes together			0
' that was an enjoyable game to play in , even though we got beaten 1 - 0			1
we felt we were there all the game , pushing			0
i know which team i would have wanted to be on			0
@entity4 celebrate as the @entity109 beat @entity45 2 - 0 in the @entity43 on wednesday ' we 've got to think about some of the positive performances and not get too downbeat about losing 2 - 0 to @entity13			1
we 've got to bounce back			1
' we know how punishing the league is and we 've got to look to move on as quickly as we can			0
' @entity0 will run out at @entity113 on four bookings for the campaign and knowing a fifth is inevitable sooner or later because of the nature of his game			2
however , he has worked hard on his discipline and is confident he has made progress			0
he said : ' i 've played every minute of every game so far , so there 's a good chance i 'm going to get booked			0
@entity126 and @entity127 look deflated at the restart as the holders lost at home to the @entity109 ' maybe that would have affected me more when i was younger , but five bookings before december 31 - that 's maybe 18 , 19 games			1
( @entity138 ) @entity137 got booked in the first five games of the season ( he was booked in five of the first seven league games ) without a mention , @entity135 and @entity136 missed a game			2
' there 's been a couple i have n't been happy with , but it 's part of the game , is n't it ? it 's basically not a problem			0
' i would n't want to miss a weekend			0
if i miss a midweek it 's not so bad , but a weekend disrupts your rhythm			0

@entity1 have lost their last two games an aggregate of 10 - 0
@entity4 have won three games on the spin after *horrific* start
@entity0 believes @entity1 should copy @entity109 ' lead
he expects his side to ' bounce back ' against @entity8 on monday
