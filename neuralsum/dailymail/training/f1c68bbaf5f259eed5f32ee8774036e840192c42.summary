they show she fretted about the effect that appeasing nationalists in @entity13 – for example , relaxing the rules on flying flags – would have on other minorities in the @entity6			1
speaking at an @entity3 peace - building summit 30 years ago , she said : ‘ if these things were done , the next question would be what comes next ? ‘ were the @entity22 in @entity23 to be allowed to fly their own flag ? ’ @entity23 , an @entity5 enclave in @entity26 , became a hotbed of racial tensions in the 1970s			1
it was there that @entity31 , an anti-racist campaigner , was killed after police knocked him unconscious during a protest against the @entity35 in 1979			2
it was also the scene of a notorious race riot in 1981			2
the @entity38 told of her fears behind closed doors during her meeting with then @entity3 prime minister @entity42 for talks at @entity44 in november 1984			0
she could not understand why @entity45 in @entity13 were looking for certain rights and demanding reforms in policing , justice , equality and power - sharing			0
and she said there were minorities all over @entity54 who were not making the same sort of claims			2
the newly declassified files released by @entity59 ’s @entity58 contain an official note of the two - hour @entity44 summit that reveals mrs @entity0 ’s ‘ incomprehension ’ as to what exactly @entity3 nationalists wanted			1
the meeting was described as rapid and vigorous by those there			0
mr @entity42 , then leader of the @entity69 party , explained that the minority felt they were @entity3 and a part of the majority of the island of @entity13 ‘ from which they had been cut off by an arbitrary act ’			0
the @entity6 had drawn a line around the six counties , creating a @entity81 majority , cutting off the minority from the nation and people were ‘ set against each other within a narrow space , ’ he said			0
he added there was ‘ hard evidence ’ of bias in the justice , security and policing systems in @entity13 while the guns of the @entity93 ’s @entity92 were being used to ‘ bully ’ @entity45			0
the @entity38 told of her fears behind closed doors during a meeting with @entity3 prime minister @entity42 mr @entity42 warned mrs @entity0 that she needed to deal with the alienation of northern nationalists			1
‘ they can not fly the flag of their own nation in their own country , ’ he said			1
