by @entity0 a cadet officer has told an @entity3 court how @entity6 captain @entity4 did not ' slip into a lifeboat ' as he claims but jumped off while stricken passengers and crew were still on board			1
@entity11 was giving evidence during the trial in which @entity14 is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the @entity6 after the luxury liner struck rocks off the coast of the @entity3 island of @entity20			1
thirty - two people died in the disaster and the trial has focused on the behaviour of @entity14 , who was dubbed ' captain coward ' after it emerged he had refused orders by coastguards to get back on board and help coordinate the rescue efforts			1
@entity14 , pictured , is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the @entity6 after it hit rocks			1
crew member @entity32 told his trial she was ordered to send passengers back to their cabins @entity11 told the hearing in @entity37 : ' @entity4 , shortly before me , jumped onto the roof of a lifeboat by deck four , shortly afterwards the area where we were , was then underwater as the @entity6 slipped on the rocks			1
' we had formed a human chain so as not to slip , i was part of that team named @entity47 and we helped five people who had been hurt			0
' then when i could n't see any more passengers , together with @entity14 and four others we went to went to where the lifeboats were			0
' i jumped onto the roof but @entity14 was already there , he had jumped just before me			0
as soon as the lifeboat launched , the ship rolled and the deck where we had been was submerged			0
we picked up passengers who were in the water as we headed to the shore			0
' in the dock : captain @entity4 seen as he arrives for his trial in the town of @entity37 @entity14 has insisted that he ' tripped and fell ' into a lifeboat as the 290m luxury liner lay stricken on rocks just off the coast of the @entity3 island of @entity20 but prosecutors insist he failed in his duty and fled the scene while more than 300 people were still onboard			1
according to the investigation @entity14 was on dry land just after midnight , nearly three hours after the @entity6 has initially struck the rocks but the last person was not rescued until 4am			2
@entity11 painted a vivid picture of the frantic panic that had gripped @entity14 after he had steered the liner , which had more than 4,000 passengers and crew onboard , onto the rocks and said : ' he was saying " what have i done ? i 'm finished sailing			0
" ' my job was to monitor the equipment and make sure the ship was stable during sailing and i remember just as we struck the rocks there were vibrations and i could hear that we had scraped the bottom			0
' cruise ship @entity6 lies stricken off the shore of the island of @entity20 in january 2012 @entity11 ended his testimony to the court by telling prosecutor @entity101 that he had been told by other officers on the bridge , that @entity14 had a ' briefcase with him between his legs ' as he escaped in the lifeboat to safety			1
while the rescue was ongoing and @entity14 was in the lifeboat , in a widely reported telephone call that was leaked to the media , coastguard chief @entity108 can be heard ordering him : '' get back on board , for f * * * 's sake			2
' but @entity14 refused to do so and instead he made his way to a hotel on the island where he waited for officials to arrive and he was later taken away to the mainland where he was arrested and ultimately charged			0
salvage operators in @entity121 lifted the @entity6 cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of @entity20 in september , in the biggest ever project of its kind			0
it will soon be scrapped in a break during the hearing , @entity127 , a lawyer representing the island of @entity20 , said : ' everyone knew that night the @entity6 's route - you just had to watch it on the internet and various marine traffic websites - you could see that the ship had changed route			2
' prosecutors say that @entity14 deliberately altered the course of the @entity6 so that he could carry out the sail by salute of @entity20 and so impress passengers and islanders but it was a course of action that proved dramatically and tragically foolhardy			2
the disaster happened on january 13 , 2012 , just hours after the @entity6 had left the port of @entity147 for a seven day @entity149 cruise and on board there were 35 @entity153 passengers and crew			1
if convicted @entity14 faces a minimum of 20 years in jail - meanwhile salvage experts confirmed today that the @entity6 has been made secure in the face of strong winter storms forecast to hit the area , with a system of 28 steel anchors .			2
