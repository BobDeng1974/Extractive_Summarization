right from the beginning , i felt “ very nice person , good human ”			0

he also touched heads with the heir to the throne , another sign of how close the pair have become over the years			0
since the @entity8 last met the exiled spiritual leader he has held discussions with @entity83 's president @entity82 , raising the subject of @entity85 during talks in @entity87 in 2009			1
