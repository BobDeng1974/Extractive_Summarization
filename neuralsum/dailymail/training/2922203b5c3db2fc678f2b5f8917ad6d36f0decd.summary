people sporting muffin tops , beer bellies and love handles are twice as likely to develop a serious heart problem than their thinner counterparts			0
while obesity has long been seen as a risk to heart health , new research shows midriff bulge has been linked to a sudden , and often fatal , heart malfunction			1
as the name suggests , sudden cardiac death occurs without warning , explains the report in the @entity16			1
it is caused by an unexpected loss of heart function , which rapidly reduces blood flow around the body , including to the brain			0
midriff bulge has been linked to a sudden , and often fatal , heart malfunction called sudden cardiac death the @entity27 researchers wanted to find out if those with muffin tops and beer bellies are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death , as the evidence suggests this distribution of body fat may be more dangerous			1
the risk was ascertained using the waist to hip ratio - calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement			1
studies show people with the highest waist to hip ratio are twice as likely to be affected as those with ratio in the normal range			2
but the researchers wanted to find out if those with muffin tops and beer bellies are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death - as the evidence suggests this distribution of body fat may be more dangerous			1
it is thought that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than carrying it around the hips or thighs			1
the scientists , of the @entity60 , in @entity61 , @entity62 , studied almost 15,000 middle - aged men and women aged between 45 and 64			0
all the people were taking part in the atherosclerosis risk in @entity69 study , which has been tracking the causes of artery narrowing in middle - aged @entity27 since 1987			2
all the participants underwent a detailed health assessment in 1987 - 89 , and then again in 1990 - 92 , 1993 - 95 , 1996 - 98 and 2011 - 13			0
it is thought that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than carrying it around the hips or thighs			1
this included measurements of weight , height , waist circumference and the waist to hip ratio			0
during the monitoring period , which averaged 12.5 years , sudden cardiac deaths occurred			0
on average , those affected were in their mid- 50s , two - thirds of victims were men and 40 per cent were of @entity92 heritage			0
unsurprisingly , those who died suddenly tended to have more known risk factors for heart disease , such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol			0
they also had a higher @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , larger waist circumference and a larger waist to hip ratio - an indicator of central obesity - than those who were not affected			2
the risk of sudden cardiac death was associated with general obesity , but only in non-smokers			1
and of the measures of obesity - @entity98 , waist circumference , and waist to hip ratio - the latter was the most strongly linked to sudden cardiac death risk after taking other influential factors into account			1
and unlike @entity98 and waist circumference , the link between waist to hip ratio stood regardless of existing coronary heart disease , diabetes or high blood pressure and other known risk factors			2
the researchers stressed the study is an observational one , so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect			0
they added the precise mechanisms for the association between sudden cardiac death and central obesity are not known			2
however it is known that fat around the midriff is thought to be more critical than fat stored elsewhere in the body , because of its influence on inflammation .			0

midriff bulge *doubles* the risk of suffering from sudden cardiac death
biggest risk is in people with large waist to hip ratio , say @entity27 researchers
*backs* previous research that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than around the hips or thighs
