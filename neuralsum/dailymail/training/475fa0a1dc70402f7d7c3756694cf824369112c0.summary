sometimes it can be a lonely existence in goal and @entity3 found his north @entity5 baptism no less brutal at one end of the @entity7 than it was at the other			0
having conceded four in a blur at @entity10 on saturday and it somehow got worse for @entity13 's rookie keeper as he conceded four more at @entity14			1
he made a dreadful error for the first , dropping the ball from a corner , which allowed @entity18 to put @entity14 in control of this @entity21 quarter - final			1
@entity22 tried hard not to criticise @entity3 but confessed games swung on moments like that			0
@entity14 's @entity18 celebrates his instinctive goal taking advantage of a @entity29 error to put @entity14 ahead 1 - 0 @entity30 doubled @entity14 ' lead straight after half - time with a low driven shot that @entity3 had no chance of saving @entity14 : @entity35 ; @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6.5 ; @entity18 6.5 ( @entity40 80mins ) , @entity41 7 ; @entity42 6.5 ( @entity43 61 , 5 ) , @entity44 7 , @entity45 6 ; @entity46 7.5 ( @entity47 69 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goals : @entity18 18 , @entity42 46 , @entity46 65 , @entity47 70 booked : none manager : @entity56 7 @entity13 : @entity3 4 ; @entity57 5 , @entity58 5 , @entity59 5 , @entity60 6 ; @entity61 5.5 , @entity62 6.5 ( @entity63 73 , 6 ) ; @entity64 6 , @entity65 4.5 ( @entity66 80 ) , @entity67 5 ; @entity68 4.5 ( @entity69 60 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 goals : @entity76 booked : @entity60 manager : @entity22 6 referee : @entity79 6 attendance : 34,677 thirty - four seconds into the second half , @entity30 had lashed in another , this time a crisp strike , arrowed skilfully into the bottom corner			1
@entity46 added the third , his 12th of the season , before he was replaced by @entity47 , who pounced for the fourth when @entity3 was unable to hold a routine drive by @entity44			1
by the end , it seemed too cruel and , although @entity47 needs confidence boosting after his own goal - issues , even the home fans seemed slightly relieved when @entity3 saved from the @entity94 international near the end			2
by this point , @entity14 's place in the last four was beyond doubt , @entity56 had relaxed on the touchline and the ' @entity14 are on their way to @entity102 ' songs were cautiously aired			1
perhaps they were sung with more gusto once the semi-final draw paired them with @entity107 of @entity108 , although @entity56 seemed unsure which team from @entity110 stood between him and his first appearance at @entity102			2
for @entity13 , however , another competition slips by and the long quest for silver goes on , and @entity22 's most pressing issue as he returns to @entity116 is how to stop this goalkeeping crisis wrecking what was a promising campaign			2
@entity119 and @entity120 are injured – out until mid-january - and @entity121 is on loan for the season at @entity124 , with no recall clause			0
@entity3 faces a genuine test of his mental strength if there is no help forthcoming from the @entity130 , who have the facility to grant special permission for clubs to make emergency loan signings outside the transfer windows			0
this seemed to be on @entity22 's mind as he made the most of his goalkeeper 's shoulder injury through the closing minutes of the game			0
@entity3 had treatment once and then , when there was another break in play for @entity43 to receive attention , the @entity13 boss nudged his physio to run on again , to check - out the young ' keeper			1
it is easy to understand @entity22 's fears			0
his only alternative is @entity71 , who is 17 and has even less experience			0
' there 's no way our 17 - year - old should be forced in at this level , ' said the @entity13 boss			2
@entity14 midfielder @entity44 ( centre ) brings the ball down under pressure from @entity13 's @entity61 ( right ) striker @entity46 does the dirty work too in this challenge with @entity13 's @entity68 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) @entity13 keeper @entity3 jumps to claim a regulation catch from a corner , but oh no.			1
. the ball slips through the @entity170 third - choice stopper 's fingers as @entity18 lurks below him @entity18 gets the decisive touch while @entity3 scrambles on the ground and @entity61 ( left ) can only watch as the ball finds the net @entity18 ( centre ) and his fellow @entity14 conclude their celebrations and head back for the restart rookie keeper @entity3 stands dejected after the error that led to @entity14 opener true , these extreme experiences can build character , but they can also scar young footballers and no - one wants to see @entity3 , who is out of contract at the end of the season , suffer like this			1
how will he feel in sunday ’s derby , knowing @entity190 will target him ? @entity191 will do the same at @entity192 on @entity193			0
spurs did it last night , peppering his goal from distance across a slick surface			2
@entity3 , on only his second senior start , made a solid save to thwart @entity30 who had been released by a disguised pass from @entity201			2
but the mistake which triggered the slide out of the @entity21 was totally unforced			0
@entity13 's @entity62 ( left ) shoots as he 's closed down by goalscorer @entity18 ( right ) @entity14 ' @entity205 defender @entity37 ( right ) uses his height and power to beat @entity13 striker @entity68 in the air @entity67 ( right ) feels the wrath of a sliding tackle from @entity46 's towering frame @entity68 ( left ) jumps to block the clearance from @entity14 ' @entity214 defender @entity213 ( right ) @entity46 ( left ) hits top speed as the in - form striker vies to get around @entity13 defender @entity58 ( right ) @entity46 goes over under the challenge of @entity58 but the appeals from @entity14 players are turned down kane slots @entity14 third and puts the result beyond doubt with his left foot for his 12th goal of the year @entity46 holds off the challenge of @entity170 defender @entity59 to slot his strike inside the far post ( from left ) @entity41 and @entity201 embrace @entity46 shortly before the star striker is substituted @entity3 was all alone as he jumped to catch @entity44 ’s high corner kick , only for the ball to slither from his grasp and spill at the feet of @entity18 , who forced it over the line for his first @entity14 goal			1
@entity13 had conceded after 18 minutes , just as they had at @entity239 in october			0
@entity14 should probably have been awarded a penalty when @entity46 was tripped by @entity58 before half - time , but referee @entity79 waved play on			1
the decision did not influence the result which is a lucky break for @entity79 who was heavily criticised for a penalty he awarded to @entity247 in a 1 - 0 win against @entity249 , and then found his next appearance to be at @entity251 , in @entity108			1
@entity13 rallied briefly , after going behind , with @entity252 keeping out two fierce strikes from the impressive @entity62 before the break while @entity255 and @entity67 wasted clear opportunities to equalise			0
while @entity13 ’s goalkeeper squirmed in the spotlight , their strikers were in no mood to spare his embarrassment			0
@entity47 ( centre ) and @entity44 ( left ) high - ten after @entity47 scored the fourth after @entity3 could n't handle the @entity264 's shot @entity47 controlled with his first touch of the game and finished with his second after coming on for @entity46 @entity47 guides the ball beyond @entity3 , who had a night to forget in his first appearance at @entity239 @entity60 consoles keeper @entity3 at the end of the match as @entity13 bow out of the @entity21 even at 2 - 0 down , there was a glimpse of an escape but @entity275 and @entity68 somehow contrived to miss a sitter created by @entity64			1
with not a defender in the frame , @entity275 was first to the cross at the near - post but his contact was so thin he glanced it away from his team - mate and it flashed wide at the far - post			0
the @entity239 fight - back in october was inspired by @entity288 ’s goal , six seconds into the second half , but this time it was @entity14 who came flying out of the interval			1
@entity30 struck after 34 seconds , cutting across the pitch from left - to - right before unleashing a sweet drive inside the post from just outside the penalty box			2
@entity22 claimed @entity3 would have saved it had it not clipped @entity58 ’s heel on the way			0
the goalkeeper did make a decent save from @entity302 and @entity60 cleared off the line from @entity213 ’s header before @entity46 and @entity47 piled on the misery and @entity14 started to dream of @entity102 .			1

@entity14 's @entity18 made it 1 - 0 in the 18th minute after @entity13 keeper @entity29 dropped a corner
spurs struck again for 2 - 0 straight after half - time through after slick work in the box from @entity30
@entity46 's 12th goal of the season was @entity14 third then his substitute @entity47 scored the fourth
@entity14 now face @entity107 in their semi-final while @entity320 will play @entity321
