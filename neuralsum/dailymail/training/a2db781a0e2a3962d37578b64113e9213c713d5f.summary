@entity0 may have liked his shaken , not stirred , but now there ’s a machine that makes cocktails that float in mid-air			2
@entity6 scientists have created what they claim is the world ’s first levitating cocktail machine , which uses sound waves to suspend tiny droplets of alcohol that drinkers can lick out of the air			1
so far inventor @entity15 has served @entity16 and @entity18 cocktails using the quirky machine			1
bottoms up ! @entity6 scientists have created what they claim is the world ’s first levitating cocktail machine , which uses sound waves to suspend tiny droplets of alcohol that drinkers can lick out of the air ( pictured ) he came up with the idea for the @entity28 along with professor @entity29 of @entity30			1
it uses ultrasonic sound waves to generate a levitating field capable of trapping tiny alcohol droplets and floating them in mid-air			1
‘ it 's a pretty powerful machine			0
so far we 've made a levitating @entity16 at 70 per cent proof and a levitating bloody mary cocktail using vodka at 160 per cent proof which will blow your socks off , ' mr @entity15 said			2
professor @entity29 explained : ‘ sound waves , even in the form of your voice have an inherent amount of power			2
work in progress : so far inventor @entity15 ( pictured right , alongside professor @entity29 ) has served @entity16 and @entity18 cocktails using the bizarre machine ( also shown ) a device called @entity55 , which looks like a goldfish ball containing smoke , lets people inhale cocktails and food such as lemon tart			1
it was invented by a @entity64 professor and aerosol scientist			0
liquid such as whisky is poured into the base of the machine , which when switched on , creates a cloud of tiny droplets suspended in a glass dome			2
like the levitating cocktail maker , it uses ultrasonic sound waves , which are generated by vibrating piezoelectric crystals			1
the waves alternate low and high pressures through the liquid , which make it bubble and form tiny droplets that behave like a cloud			0
the device can be bought for around $ 167 ( £ 104 )			0
‘ the @entity28 uses very powerful sound waves in the ultrasonic spectrum which crucially are beyond the range of human hearing , otherwise it would seriously damage your ears when the machine was switched on			1
’ the machine is the first step in a wider project to create contactless cutlery and levitating popcorn			0
the team plan on eventually being able to float an entire roast meal into hungry diner ’s mouths			0
currently , the @entity28 costs around £ 30,000 but they are working on cutting the cost			0
mr @entity15 has previously invented edible mist machines , an ice cream pottery gramophone wheel and glow in the dark ice cream , at events company @entity105 , which he founded			0
the company is now working on developing a jellybean waterfall , whirlwind popcorn storm and an edible aftershave range			0
choice : so far inventor @entity15 has served @entity16 and @entity18 cocktails ( pictured ) using the quirkly machine			1
he hopes one day to be able to levitate a whole roast dinner			2

so far inventor @entity15 has served @entity16 and @entity18 cocktails using the bizarre machine
' @entity28 ' machine was developed with help from a @entity30 expert
it uses ultrasonic sound waves to generate a levitating field capable of trapping tiny alcohol droplets and floating them in mid-air
*experts* one day hope to be able to levitate a whole roast dinner for diners
