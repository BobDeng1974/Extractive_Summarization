with an open plan kitchen and a cosy corner bed , it 's all you could want from a poky city flat			1
but this is a detached suburban home - and it 's one of the smallest of its kind in the country			0
at just 14ft wide , the former @entity11 coach house looks more like a childhood crayon sketch than a couple 's first - time buy			1
estate agents , however , insist the £ 99,950 price tag makes it just that			2
@entity17 : at just 14ft by 13ft , this former coach house in @entity19 could be @entity21 's smallest detached home cosy : the house is on sale for £ 99,950 - less than a fifth of the price of a garage sold in @entity28 , @entity29 the property stands in the grounds of a larger @entity11 house which was converted into 11 flats in the @entity19 suburb of @entity35			1
measuring 14ft 1in by 12ft 9in , it has 359 sq ft over two floors excluding a garage which comes with the price			0
into that space , the couple who live there currently have fitted an open - plan kitchen with a sofa and tv along with a bathroom , double bedroom and even a tiny landing			1
the bedroom measures 9ft 9in by 8ft 4in , enough room to squish in a double bed and a small shoe rack , along with a built - in wardrobe			0
the house 's unusual design means it has had a wave of interest , say its estate agents - especially as detached houses in the same street have sold for up to £ 500,000			1
a room with two views : the bedroom measures 9ft 9in by 8ft 4in , enough room to squish in a double bed squeeze : the floor plan shows how the stairs rise over the electric hob , and there is even a small landing @entity71 from @entity73 estate agents claimed the house could be snapped up before @entity75			2
' it 's the smallest detached house i 've ever seen , ' he said			0
' despite only being on the market for about three weeks we 've had lots of viewings - it 's been a mixture of first time buyers and buy to let enquiries			0
' the coach @entity86 is such a unique place - it was incredibly hard to value			0
' @entity89 takes up the entire ground floor which is exactly what people who after open plan living want			2
' and you 'll be hard pressed to find another detached house , with off - street covered parking , around here for under £ 100,000			1
' the price is indeed cheaper than the average detached home in @entity19 , which sells for £ 280,000 , or even the average terraced house at £ 127,000			1
bargain : the house is almost a third of the price of the average detached home in @entity19 , at £ 280,000 downside : sadly its external walls and use of electric storage heaters mean it will cost more to keep warm bonus : the house comes with this garage			1
estate agent @entity71 said : ' you 'll be hard pressed to find another detached house , with off - street covered parking , around here for under £ 100,000 ' but all those external walls mean the house is likely to cost far more to heat than the average home			1
it comes only with electric storage heaters and not gas central heating			0
the kitchen hob , too , runs on electricity			0
and the price will seem like a dream to anyone in @entity29 , where @entity21 's most expensive garage went on sale just weeks ago - for £ 550,000			1
the ramshackle lock - up off the @entity135 in @entity28 earned the enormous auction house price tag because it had planning permission to be demolished and turned into a small house			2
technically , there is a detached home which claims to be an inch smaller than the one in @entity19 - but it 's a bit of a push			2
developer @entity144 built the 14ft wide property last year in what used to be a parking space between two end - of - terrace houses in @entity149 , @entity150			0
unsurprisingly , his neighbours were not impressed - as the 70 - year - old left a gap of just four inches on each side of his skinny home , blocking out a gable window			0
technically , this ' detached ' home in @entity150 is an inch smaller - squeezed between two terraced homes comparison : developer @entity144 , who built the 14ft wide property last year in what used to be a parking space between two end - of - terrace houses in @entity149 , @entity150 , left just a 4in gap on either side			0

former coach house was converted in @entity19 suburb of @entity35
it has bedroom , bathroom , open plan kitchen with sofa - even a landing
it is on sale for £ 99,950 - a fifth of large detached homes on same street
and buyers get value for money , as it also comes with a *private* garage
just weeks ago a garage in @entity28 , @entity29 , went on sale for £ 550,000
