by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 man who once was considered a psychopathic serial killer has been freed , after authorities found that his eight murder convictions were based on false confessions			1
@entity8 was convicted of eight murders in a series of trials from 1994 to 2001 - despite there being no forensic evidence or witness statements - and confessed to more than 30 killings in total			1
but the 63 - year - old later recanted his confessions , saying that he made them to get attention and drugs , and prosecutors dropped the final murder charge in july last year			1
freed : @entity8 was convicted of eight murders in a series of trials from 1994 to 2001 - despite there being no forensic evidence or witness statements - and confessed to more than 30 killings in total yesterday , a court in @entity30 , @entity3 , ordered his release from a secure psychiatric unit where he has been held since 1991 - ruling that he should continue to receive care , but no longer in a closed unit			1
each of @entity8 ’s convictions was overturned after prosecutors said they had no other evidence linking him to the deaths , some of which may not even have been murders			1
‘ he has been detained for 20 years in a locked psychiatric clinic			1
it is a miscarriage of justice , ’ said his lawyer @entity43 , adding that they will now start looking at whether to seek damages			2
@entity8 had been kept at the mental institution until now , waiting for a verdict on whether his mental health was good enough to let him out			1
his case is one that has gripped @entity3 for years			2
unexplained : @entity8 claimed he killed 17 - year - old @entity56 @entity55 ( left ) in 1981 , and strangled prostitute @entity57 ( right ) in 1985 the government launched a commission of inquiry last november looking into possible shortfalls in the legal system that may have resulted in @entity8 's convictions			1
outside : each of @entity8 's convictions was overturned after prosecutors said they had no other evidence linking him to the deaths he relished his reputation as ' @entity3 's answer to @entity69 ' and would happily regale anyone in ear shot with stories of murder , mutilation , rape and cannibalism			1
his tales of how he strangled , stabbed , defiled and mutilated his victims captivated and horrified his homeland , cementing his standing as @entity3 ’s most prolific and deranged serial killer			2
some victims he claimed he stabbed , others he strangled and one he beat to death with a rock			2
some he said he raped , others he chopped up and one he even claimed to have eaten			2
but what was constant throughout all his gruesome confessions was the detail with which he described the murders : how he killed them , where he killed them , even their last words			1
he managed to hoodwink judges , psychiatrists , journalists and the @entity3 public , until he decided to make his most staggering confession of all : that he had made it all up			0
his near forensic knowledge of many of the murders convinced detectives and prosecutors that he must have committed the crimes			1
nobody bothered to find out that he had studied the killings during regular trips to a local library on day trips from the asylum			0
@entity8 , a convicted sex offender and bank robber who at the time had changed his name to @entity8 , had already been locked up in the @entity118 hospital for a botched bank robbery			1
1976 , @entity120 , 15 he claimed to have picked the teenager up in his car by the side of a road			2
after persuading him to engage in a sexual act he said he strangled him , abused the body and cut it up with a saw in nearby woods			0
he said he took a leg as a souvenir			0
1980 , @entity133 , 11 he spotted @entity134 by the side of a road and asked to check if he had run over a cat			0
when the boy bent over he smashed his head against the door and dragged him into his car			0
he drove the boy into the countryside , where he sexually assaulted then strangled him			0
he buried some of the organs , put the hands on the car 's front seat , the head , legs and torso in plastic bags			0
he said what he did no't throw out of the window he took home and ate			0
1981 , @entity55 , 17 after beating and raping her , he said he strangled her with the strap of her handbag 1984 , @entity158 and @entity159 the @entity161 couple were on a camping holiday			0
he said he stabbed the husband through the tent canvas and clambered inside			0
he described the attack in extraordinary detail , accurately numbering how many times each victim was stabbed			0
1985 , @entity169 , 23 he made the @entity56 female prostitute strip before he tortured her , and he described how she vomited as he strangled her			0
1988 , @entity172 student , @entity171 , 24 he said he and an accomplice took the tourist , who was seeing relatives , to a holiday home in the woods and killed him when he tried to escape			2
1988 , @entity178 , nine the @entity56 girl was waiting at a bus shelter for a downpour to end when he pulled her down a slope and bashed her head against a rock			0
he later told how disappointed he was that she was not a boy			0
he said her last words were : ' mummy , mummy '			0
he then dismembered and buried her , returning a year later to burn the remains			2
police later found a bone fragment that matched that of a young girl that appeared to have been cut by a sharp instrument in the spot he identified			0
it was there , during a series of therapy sessions which he says were so uninteresting that he felt a failure even at that , that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take notice of him			2
he told @entity212 in an interview last august how when he said his heavily - pregnant mother had walked in on his father sexually abusing him at the age of ten , the therapist 's interest sparked up			2
such was the shock at what his mother had seen , he claimed , that she miscarried the baby onto the bedroom floor			2
he told how the next day his father took him to bury the dead foetus in nearby woodland			0
as the therapist listened intently to his tale , for the first time he felt important			0
and within weeks he was telling staff he was behind one of @entity3 's most famous unsolved murders - that of 11 - year - old @entity133 whose torso alone was found in 1980			1
as the months drew on he confessed to a host of other murders including that of a 15 - year - old boy in 1976 ; a 17 - year - old girl in 1981 ; @entity161 husband and wife in 1984 ; a 23 - year - old female prostitute in 1985 ; and an @entity172 student and a 9 - year - old @entity56 girl in 1988			1
of those eight murders he was convicted , despite claims of a lack of real evidence			1
retrials were ordered in each case , but prosecutors said that without the confessions they did n't have enough evidence to go back to court			1
last july they dropped the final case , which involved the death of 15 - year - old boy who disappeared in northern @entity3 in 1976			1
@entity8 was convicted in 1994 of murdering the boy , even though there was no technical evidence linking him to the crime and the cause of death could not be established			1
the lack of evidence to support the confessions led to some doubts over @entity8 's guilt , but a 2006 review by @entity3 's chancellor of justice found no problems with the convictions			1
two years later @entity8 recanted in a @entity3 tv documentary , saying he had fabricated the story of @entity8 the serial killer			1
he now claims it was a cry for attention , fuelled by heavy medication			0
@entity276 , a @entity3 legal expert who was not involved with the case , last year called it the country ’s ' greatest miscarriage of justice in modern times			1
' he said it was particularly painful for the families of the victims , who are unlikely to ever find out the truth of what happened to their loved ones			0
with @entity8 's confessions withdrawn , there are no longer any strong links between the eight deaths , and it is not even clear that all were homicides			1
in two cases no bodies were found .			0
