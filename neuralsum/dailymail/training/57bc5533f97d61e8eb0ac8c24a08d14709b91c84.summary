i was a fat , spotty girl sitting on the sea front in @entity43 imagining , dreaming , being absolutely sure that a big producer would drive by in a car with a cigar and lean out of the window and say " hey , what 's your name ? you 're the one i ’ve been looking for ! "			1
' when she finally managed to break into the world of film , @entity9 said she was more lost than ever before			2
