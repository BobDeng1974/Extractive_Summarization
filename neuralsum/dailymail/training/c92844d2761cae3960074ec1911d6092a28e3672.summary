by @entity0 @entity2 - based author @entity1 threw himself in the underworld of swinging at sex parties an author has lifted the lid on the world of swingers and revealed how thanks to the internet they have come out of suburbia and into a home near you			1
@entity2 - based @entity1 spent three years having sex with dozens of couples in his quest to understand the subculture known as ‘ @entity19 ’			1
his conquests include a vixen in her 50s who liked having sex with soldiers and a mother who switched from bad cop to loving mother when her five - year - old walked in on them			2
he tells how he becomes such a hit that he had three ‘ playdates ’ a week including one with a wife who screams so loudly he worried the neighbors would call the police			0
at one sex party he was the youngest there by three decades - where the mature ladies fought amongst themselves to ‘ break him in ’			2
along the way he learned the ‘ @entity44 ’ to ensure that he wins acceptance and gets praised as a ‘ respectful and skilled single male ’			0
@entity1 hopes that other men will read his book and become better educated swingers than he was - and wo n’t have to go through the same hardships that he did			1
in his expose of the @entity50 swing scene , @entity1 has gone to great lengths to disguise who the people are that he mentions in his encounters			1
but he is honest about himself and says that swinging was a way to overcome his own anxieties about sex			1
@entity1 , who lives in @entity2 , says that the golden rules of swinging are : thou shalt not lie - be truthful about your appearance , your age , relationship status and sexual orientation			1
@entity1 describes his encounters at sex parties as either one - on - ones , threesomes or foursomes - sometimes with women decades older than him ( photo posed by models ) he tells aspiring swingers not to judge others , embrace rejection and be polite when it happens			1
swinging is broken down into a number of scenarios : one - on - one , threesomes , the hard or full swap - essentially a foursome when two couples all have sex , a soft swap - couples switch partners but no oral or intercourse takes place - and group scenarios			1
single women are known as ‘ unicorns ’ because they are so rare and so treasured			0
@entity1 finds out about sex parties on @entity92 or sex websites on the @entity94 and , once he has a lead , goes on masturbation diets to ensure that ‘ there was no way i was n’t going to be able to perform ’			1
of his encounters , the anecdotes are legion			0
one man with a brusque voice calls him up and asks right away : ‘ so , you have experience with rough sex ’			0
at eight that night he goes to the address the man texted to be greeted by a woman called @entity109 who wore ‘ a powder blue lace bra and matching panties ’			0
@entity1 and another man engaged in uncomfortable small talk about granite versus laminate counter tops before being introduced to ‘ @entity116 ’ who was in a side room			2
@entity1 writes : ‘ each of her limbs was tied to a different corner of the mattress with thickly braided white rope and over her petite , tanned torso were sprinkled condoms of seemingly every size and variety in the history of prophylactic manufacture			2
‘ @entity116 appeared a sexual sundae of sorts ’			0
@entity1 tells how he became such a hit that he had three ' playdates ' per week and found sex parties on @entity92 ( picture posed by models ) four men have sex with her and @entity109 and @entity1 joins in until he tries to stand on the mattress - and clips his head on a ceiling fan , sending blood over himself and ruining the mood			1
he receives oral sex from a single woman in a secluded spot in his car and sleeps with a woman in her 50s who tells a @entity153 who has also been invited to the party : ‘ i can take whatever you got soldier ’			0
@entity1 writes about the physical dangers of swinging and whilst having sex with one particularly athletic partner he is thrown off her and onto the floor where he injures his pelvis			1
@entity1 is hurt so badly he is put on morphine and has to see an orthopedist who says he needs an agonising procedure and weeks of treatment to correct the damage			2
in the author disclaimer , @entity1 writes that ‘ swinging is n’t for everyone ’ and asks that readers come with an ‘ open mind and a certain level of curiosity ’			1
he says that anyone can follow in his footsteps , so long as they are respectful and follow the rules of the lifestyle			0
he writes : ‘ i ’m a regular guy			0
‘ granted , a regular guy who ’s had one - on - ones , @entity182 , @entity183 , foursomes , moresomes , gang bangs , orgies , phone sex , text sex , car sex , and public sex			1
’ he adds : ‘ by subjecting myself to sexual experience after sexual experience after sexual experience i was demystifying the act of sex , desensitizing my reaction to it and chipping away at the fear it held over me and beneath which i was pinned			0
‘ now , years later , i ’d escaped that tonnage of performance - hindering anxiety and understood sex for what it was : fun ’			2
for the rest of the book he continues his anecdotes , such as when he is at a party full of older couples and is the youngest by far			0
@entity1 's book @entity212 gets between the sheets of the lifestyledaniel stern swingland @entity1 writes how he surveys the room whilst eating some mashed potatoes he serves himself from the buffet which had been laid on by the hosts			2
a woman called @entity220 jumps onto him just as he finishes eating , tears his clothes off and summons two more males to wear down her ‘ limitless energy ’			0
she screams at all three of them : ‘ f * * * me now ! ’ things continue until @entity220 has ‘ the orgasm of all orgasms ’ that causes her to collapse and for @entity1 to temporarily fear that she has died - until she comes out of it			1
on another occasion , given just an hour ’s notice , @entity1 borrows his friend ’s car and drives halfway across town to meet a couple who want a threesome			2
while the wife busied herself in the bathroom on their hotel room , her husband and @entity1 watched a @entity245 movie to pass the time - which they left on whilst both having sex with her			1
the first sex party he details includes a copy of the invitation to ‘ @entity254 and @entity255 ’s 7th @entity253 ! ’ it reads : ‘ arrival at 7pm , dinner at 7.30pm , followed by @entity258 at 7.31pm ’			0
once inside @entity1 talks to a large man called @entity260 and introduces himself with the words : ‘ i ’m a boring straight male ’ , which were designed to put him at ease			0
@entity260 asks @entity1 if he likes to give oral sex , if he is a good kisser and if he uses condoms			1
@entity260 then asks how big @entity1 ’s penis is and if he trims downstairs			0
when @entity1 reveals that his balls are shaven , @entity260 replies : ‘ good man ’ and lets his wife have sex with him			1
@entity1 sums up the process like this : ‘ i had progressed this far with @entity260 because i knew f * * * * * * @entity260 ’s wife as the same as f * * * * * * @entity260 ’			0
@entity1 's book is called @entity280 .			0
