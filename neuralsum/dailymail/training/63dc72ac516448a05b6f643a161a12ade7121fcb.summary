many of the items @entity12 dealer @entity10 bought were once so underrated they would have sold for little more than their value in precious metal			1
and yesterday historians were celebrating his gift to a museum of one of the most important collections of @entity22 and @entity24 objects for more than a century			1
precious : a group of @entity27 silver gilt cups of a stag by @entity29 ( c.1605 - 10 ) , an owl ( c.1570 ) , a ship model ( c. 1620 ) , a @entity33 musketeer by @entity34 ( c. 1600 ) and a bear ( c. 1605 - 10 ) director of the @entity38 dr @entity37 ( right ) and professor @entity39 , @entity41 's @entity40 , discuss a silver gilt pitcher his haul of nearly 500 items , valued together in the tens of millions , has been bequeathed to @entity48 ’s ashmolean museum			0
among them are highly unusual works that were considered inferior or undesirable at the time he bought them , compared to more traditional or sought - after pieces			1
this month the spoils of his shrewd eye and travels around the continent will go on display before being housed in a permanent gallery , described as ‘ a cabinet of wonders ’			0
the collection , bequeathed after mr @entity10 ’s death last year , was trumpeted as ‘ the most important accession of objects of this sort to any @entity69 museum ’ since a bequest by @entity71 to the @entity72 in 1898			1
important donation : a @entity27 @entity75 ewer and basin with silver gilt mounts ( c.1580 ) the blues : a lapis lazuli cup ( pictured left ) with jewelled and enamelled silver gilt mounts made with stone ( c. 1560 ) and a bowl ( right ) with gold mounts from @entity84 ( c. 1608 ) admiration : a woman looks at a ' silver gilt ewer with enamelled royal arms of @entity89 ' that dates from around 1510 ad impressive : the collection of nearly 500 objects has been valued at tens of millions of pounds historically it spans more than 250 years from the 1500s to 1700s			1
aesthetically , however , it encompasses a fascinating spectrum of style and craftsmanship , including works that incorporate coconut shell , ostrich egg , ivory and mother of pearl			0
such items have come to be highly prized by wealthy collectors – but few of his contemporaries appear to have had mr @entity10 ’s unerring nose for a bargain			2
according to one friend , he was expert in securing under - priced items – but , the friend added : ‘ he bought a great many things simply because he liked them , not because they were sought - after or fashionable			0
’ mr @entity10 , who died aged 84 , was driven by a passion for craftsmanship			2
he joined the family silver - dealing business at 18 and built it into one of the best known in @entity119 , with premises in @entity121			0
his private collection , acquired during more than six decades of travel and trade , also reflected his fascination for exotic materials , especially from the @entity127 and the @entity128			0
