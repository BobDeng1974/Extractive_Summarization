by @entity0 great @entity2 menu judge @entity1 has blamed tv chefs for making @entity2 a nation of couch potatoes she is the doyenne of the culinary world with more than 50 years ’ experience in the kitchen			1
great @entity2 menu judge @entity1 , 74 , was running her own catering company at 20 , ran the respected @entity1 for nearly two decades and has published 12 cookbooks			1
but woe betide any chefs who try to impress her with food which is too clever for its own good			1
miss @entity18 criticised molecular gastronomy chefs for trying to show off with clever techniques which added nothing to the flavour of dishes			1
and she complained the culture of celebrity chefs was breeding a generation who watch cookery shows ' while stuffing their faces with pizza , @entity33 and chocolate bars			1
' speaking at the @entity36 in @entity37 last weekend , the @entity35 - trained septuagenarian said : ' the trouble with all these fashions is that every second chef who is half good thinks they can do it too			0
' it tends to be dominated by machinery they have got in the kitchen rather than the quality of the ingredients or what things go together			0
' you get too many flavours because something has been dehydrated and pulverised until it is a sort of sand or powder , or something has been dropped into a calcium bath to make it into little balls like caviar			0
then there is a lump of meat that has been in a water bath for a long time … by the time they have done all that , where is the flavour ? ' miss @entity18 also railed against ' ridiculous ' celebrity culture , which she blamed for warping children ’s aspirations			1
when she goes into schools and even catering colleges , pupils are only interested in tv cooks like @entity74 and @entity75 because they are famous rather than because they can cook			2
' it is the wrong thing for children to aspire to , ' said miss @entity1			1
' some of these tv chefs do not have any restaurants at all			1
' it is just performance , which is fine , but when food came out of the @entity87 education [ department ] , it was all rather solemn			0
' no one cooks from celebrity chefs at all because it has nothing to do with cooking , it is just entertainment			2
' they buy their books , which lie on coffee tables untouched			0
they watch the shows because the average adult in @entity102 watches five hours of tv a day and it just happens to be cheap telly			1
' it is heartbreaking that we see these chefs doing beautiful things with wonderful ingredients while they are sitting on sofas stuffing their faces with pizza , @entity33 and chocolate bars			1
' @entity1 with fellow @entity115 judges during a series special			1
she said ' ridiculous ' celebrity culture was warping children 's aspirations , also the chef said schoolteachers were to blame for feeding a hunger for celebrity culture rather than educating children about food and cited one incident when she visited a school , only to be treated ' like @entity127 ' because the children had been primed to believe a star was coming			1
chefs , she added , had become ' obsessed ' with equipment and tricks at the cost of producing quality flavours			1
' i would never say they have no place , it is just there is too much of a fashion , ' she said			0
' i am very happy to eat foam on top of a cappuccino because it is quite pleasant but the trouble with foam on most dishes is that it rapidly becomes scum so what started off looking like wonderful foamy rocks of seafood turns into some swimming pool you would not want to go near			2
' miss @entity1 said she was a fan of @entity154 , describing him as an ' absolute genius '			1
when molecular gastronomy was done well , she added , it could enhance rather than detract from the flavour of dishes			1
waiters who take too much time to describe food also came in the line of fire from the outspoken chef , who has just finished recording the ninth series of @entity115 , which will be screened on the @entity87 later this year			2
@entity1 ( right ) at @entity1			2
she also criticised gastronomy chefs for using high - tech methods that affect the way food tastes miss @entity1 described a business lunch at @entity172 in @entity173 , where diners were inflicted with a minimum of 10 courses , each accompanied by a lengthy description from the waiter			1
' the waiter comes along and tells you a story for every mouthful you eat - and there are 10 courses so it takes forever , ' she said			0
what to do if you ca n’t find an item in the shops ? for @entity190 the answer was simple – turn to @entity191			0
the celebrity chef tweeted @entity193 to demand : ‘ why does nobody sell brioche burger buns ? ’ @entity196 jumped in to reply : ‘ @entity196 is launching brioche burger and hotdog buns			0
would you like an advance sample ? ’ and @entity201 ’s @entity200 added : ‘ our taste the @entity202 @entity203 will be in stores next week ! ’ miss @entity190 , who has more than 500,000 followers , posted : ‘ let them eat brioche ’ , while other users called the storm in a teacup ‘ briochegate ’			2
' all the food was delicious and it is fascinating stuff but this is a @entity216 restaurant			0
[ my companion ] had to leave before the pudding and i thought : " this is not quite right			0
" they should serve a warning that it is a restaurant for foodies only			0
' miss @entity18 was born in @entity224 but spent her adult life in the @entity2			0
she launched her catering company in 1960 , opened her @entity227 starred restaurant @entity18 ’s at the age of 29 and started her cookery school six years later			2
she was chairwoman of the @entity230 for four years until 2010 , a government quango set up to make school dinners healthier			0
she said she resented @entity74 at first for bringing the issue to a head but was soon won over by his earnestness and dedication : ' my first reaction , i am ashamed to say , was : ‘ my @entity239 , i have been banging on about this for 40 years and so have most of the cooks i know and people who are interested in education			2
' we have all been to see the department a hundred times , we have lobbied and done our bit and along comes this whippersnapper , snaps his fingers and @entity250 gives him lots of money			0
' but that is the power of television and the power of @entity74 , because he is really amazing and engaging			0

people watching cookery shows ' while stuffing their faces ' fault of tv chefs , said @entity1
celebrities warp children 's aspirations , @entity115 judge added
@entity268 chefs showing off clever techniques often sacrifice flavour of dishes
