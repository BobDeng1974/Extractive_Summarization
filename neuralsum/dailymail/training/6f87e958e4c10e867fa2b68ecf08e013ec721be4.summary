as the actress turns 46 today , @entity20 looks back at her biggest highs and lows			1
( pictured : @entity8 at the 30th @entity25 @entity24 in january ) since 1994 , millions of women have grown up using @entity8 as a type of older sister			1
when the actress first came onto our screens as @entity2 in 1994 , her hairstyle spawned hundreds of thousands of copycats in salons across the western world			2
when she gave the credit for her bikini body to the @entity39 , those same women ditched their meals of lettuce and grilled fish for steak and eggs			0
and after she made the move to the silver screen , her legions of fans used their expendable income to turn her movies into @entity52 gold			0
we look back at some of the biggest highs and lows of @entity16 's ultimate @entity57 over the last two decades ... the @entity58 : our love of her love life @entity8 's five - year marriage to @entity7 was one of the most watched romances in celebrity history			1
they were @entity16 's golden couple - gorgeous , happy and seemingly totally untouchable			1
the world became obsessed with @entity8 's seemingly perfect marriage to @entity7 but @entity8 became the poster girl for women scorned when the actor , now 51 , ended their marriage and moved on with @entity74 in 2005			1
at the time , it was widely reported that @entity7 had started his relationship with @entity74 whilst they were filming @entity78 and mrs @entity79 together , and he was still with @entity8			1
three years later , @entity74 appeared to confirm their on - set affair , when she said of the film : ' not a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love			1
' later that year , @entity8 responded in an interview with @entity90 , where she referred to @entity74 's comments as , ' very uncool , ' and , ' inappropriate			1
' @entity8 is now happily engaged to @entity92 , who she started dating in 2012 in her first interview post-split in @entity94 in 2008 , @entity8 went into detail about her tears , heartbreak and pain over the affair			1
but the article appeared to give the star closure and she had soon bounced back by dating @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , before eventually meeting her now fiance @entity92			0
several years on , the incident is well and truly under the bridge and recently @entity8 insisted there is no longer any bad blood between her and @entity74			1
in an interview with @entity110 , she said : ' i think that 's slowly coming to an end			2
' it 's just tiresome and old			2
it 's like an old leather shoe			2
' no , let 's buy a new pair of shiny shoes			2
' the ' @entity2 ' during her time on the hit comedy show friends @entity8 became famous not just for her hilarious character @entity2 , but for the ' @entity2 ' haircut			1
the layered look , that was styled by her still hairdresser @entity125 became one of the most asked for cuts of the 90s			0
the ' @entity2 ' haircut became one of the biggest hits of the 90s but @entity8 has since referred to it as a ' disaster ' @entity8 has since spoken about how difficult the look was to maintain			1
she said : ' the @entity2 ' was one of the hardest hairstyles to maintain			0
' me and the blow dryer and the hairbrush were n't meant for each other			0
' it really was a " hairdo			0
" ' not only did the actress find it impossible to maintain , she has since revealed that she thought it was ugly			2
@entity8 with the rest of the cast of friends ( @entity148 ) @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 in an interview with @entity156 magazine , she said : ' i think it was the ugliest haircut i 've ever seen			1
how did that thing have legs ? ' ' it was all anyone ever wanted to know about , all @entity125 ever got asked to do			0
' i liked it at the time , but i started to grow it out after about eight months			0
' but it just would n't die			0
' the ' will she , wo n't she ' @entity165 whether or not @entity8 will have children has been a source of great debate among the general public for years			1
thousands of column inches in magazines have speculated on whether the actress is sporting a tiny bump , something the actress has revealed has been tough to endure			2
@entity8 has revealed that she and @entity92 are trying for a baby following her split from @entity7 , it was claimed that she had n't wanted children , something which she went on to deny in her 2008 @entity94 interview			2
she said : ' a man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children			0
that really p * * sed me off			0
' i 've never in my life said i did n't want to have children			2
i did and i do and i will ! ' the women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children ; why would i want to limit myself ? ' i 've always wanted to have children , and i would never give up that experience for a career			0
' i want to have it all			0
' @entity8 , who looked stunning on the red carpet at the @entity197 this year , has long spoken of her desire to have children however , ten years on and @entity8 is still battling speculation over whether she will have a child , this with @entity92			1
in 2014 , she was forced to once again to respond to the claims			0
she said : ' i do n't have this sort of checklist of things that have to be done , and if they 're not checked , then i 've failed some part of my feminism or my value as a woman because i have n't birthed a child			0
' i 've birthed a lot of things and feel like i 've mothered many things , and i do n't think it 's fair to put that pressure on people			0
' and in 2015 she revealed to @entity219 that she and @entity92 are trying for a child , saying : ' listen , that 's a topic that 's so exhausted			0
' i get nervous around that , just because it 's very personal			0
' who knows if it 's going to happen ? ' it 's been a want			0
we 're doing our best			0
' the grown up years despite being one of the highest earning actresses in @entity16 , @entity8 's film career has always been criticised for being a little lacklustre			1
she is best known for staring in rom - coms like @entity235 , he 's @entity236 and @entity237			1
@entity8 looked happy at the unveiling of her @entity239 in @entity16 in 2012 however , this year @entity8 's career has taken a turn for the serious			1
after starring in the critically acclaimed cake , @entity8 was even nominated for a @entity197			2
this is the first time the actress has truly gained recognition for her talents and seemingly signals a move away from the films she has starred in before			0
@entity8 has previously revealed that she enjoys the challenge of making people see that she is more than just a sitcom star , ' it excites me , actually , ' she once said			2
after the success of her first foray into serious acting , it seems like we will be seeing much more of grown - up @entity8 as she reaches her mid-forties .			1
