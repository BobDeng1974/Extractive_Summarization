@entity0 has closed the door on a possible move to @entity3 by pledging the next four years of his career to @entity5			1
with his present contract expiring in 2016 , speculation was mounting that the 29 - year - old may be tempted to explore avenues down south sooner rather than later			1
@entity10 were the latest side to be linked with the @entity12 last week but @entity0 has now headed off any such moves at the pass by committing his future to @entity5 until he turns 33			1
@entity5 captain @entity0 has signed a new deal keeping him at the club until the summer of 2018 the 29 - year - old has been at the club since 2007 , when he joined the @entity20 giants from @entity21 @entity0 , who now looks set to end his playing days as a @entity5 player , said : ‘ it ’s an absolute privilege to extend my contract with @entity5 , a brilliant football club and with such incredible supporters			1
this is a place that i call home			0
‘ being @entity5 captain is a tremendous honour and it is a role which i cherish dearly			2
the team is in a great place just now and we ’re all right behind the manager and the backroom team as they build for the future			0
‘ i will do all i can with the manager and all the players at the club to deliver the success which our supporters deserve			0
’ @entity5 have previously been reluctant to offer bumper long - term deals to players approaching the age of 30 but they have made an exception in the case of the man who is also now skipper of @entity49			1
@entity0 is keen to pursue a coaching career and it ’s understood the prospect of gaining such experience while still playing formed part of the contract negotiations			2
@entity0 talks to assistant manager and @entity49 legend @entity57 during a @entity5 training session national captains @entity0 and @entity59 shake hands before the recent friendly at @entity63 the midfielder came through the ranks at @entity21 and made his debut in 2002 before winning the @entity67 with the @entity69 side in 2007			1
he moved to @entity5 for £ 4.4million that summer and has gone on to make nearly 300 appearances for the club			2
after a sluggish start to life in green and white under @entity74 , he has developed into an invaluable part of @entity77 ’s side			0
the @entity78 feared @entity0 might miss much of his first season at @entity5 when he was stretchered off in a pre-season friendly against @entity81 , but the midfielder recovered from what proved to be a serious hamstring injury in just two months			2
in signing the new deal , he has given the clearest indication yet that he ’s content with every aspect of life at @entity5			0
a winner of four @entity90 , two @entity91 and a @entity67 in his time at @entity63 , @entity0 is now in line to complete 11 years ’ service with the club – a rarity in the modern age			0
however , he will be watching from the stands when his team - mates host @entity100 after being sent off against @entity101 before the international break .			0

@entity5 have tied down their captain @entity0 until june 2018
the 29 - year - old , who is also @entity49 captain , said it was a privilege
