a motorist has been caught speeding at 149mph – more than twice the legal motorway limit and a record for the past year others have been caught doing three times the legal limit in 30mph zones – one near a rural primary school			1
the motorway offence , on the @entity9 near @entity10 in @entity11 , was captured by a speed camera and was the highest recorded speed during the period april 2013 to may 2014			1
new digital cameras have recently been installed on the @entity9 and older ones re-activated			2
the offences were revealed in data received from police under a @entity27 request from the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1
the highest speed recorded on a 30mph road was 96mph in @entity31 in @entity32 – more than three times the legal limit			1
that just pipped the 94mph clocked up in the 30mph zone near @entity37 on the @entity38 in @entity39			2
in other 30mph zones , drivers were filmed doing 92mph on the @entity42 in @entity32 ; 86mph in @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 ; 86mph in @entity48 ’s @entity47 , @entity49 ; and 84mph on the @entity50 at @entity51 in @entity54 police ’s area			0

the fastest speed recorded last year in a 30mph zone was 96mph , however , one motorist passed @entity37 primary school in @entity39 at 94 mph the @entity28 report noted : ‘ a motorist in on the @entity9 at @entity10 holds the record for the highest speed clocked by a speed camera in @entity77 and @entity78 between april 2013 and may 2014			1
the 149 mph figure was revealed following freedom of information requests to 39 police authorities			2
’ but the @entity28 says the penalties which ‘ excessive speeders ’ face are ‘ out of sync ’ with the danger they pose to other road users and to themselves			2
@entity28 head of road safety @entity91 said : ’ let ’s be clear – we ’re not talking here of otherwise law - abiding motorists who are trying their best but may make a careless mistake and slip a few miles per hour above the posted speed limited			1
‘ these are dangerous drivers who are speeding at two or three times the legal speed limit , sometimes near schools			0
they are selfish individuals putting people ’s lives in danger			0
’ guidelines to magistrates on sentencing for speeding include a fine plus six penalty points or disqualified for between 7 and 56 days for motorists who drive at 101mph and 110mph on a 70mph road ; at between 76mph and 85 mph on a 50mph road ; or at between 51mph and 60mph in a 30mph zone			0
@entity28 chief executive @entity117 said : ‘ speed limits are a limit			1
they are not a target to beat			0
unfortunately this message has not got through to many motorists and it ’s clear that efforts to make speeding as socially unacceptable as drink - driving continue to fail			0
