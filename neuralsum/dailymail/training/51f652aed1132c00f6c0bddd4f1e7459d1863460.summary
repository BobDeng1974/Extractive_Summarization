by @entity0 increasing numbers of @entity2 and @entity3 users are being targeted by hackers who are remotely locking their devices and demanding ransom money in return			1
ransomware attacks , in which criminals remotely gain access to a device and hold it hostage , are n’t new , but they have traditionally targeted laptops and @entity17 in this latest mobile attack , the hackers are controlling gadgets by breaking into customers ' @entity22 accounts and remotely locking the devices using the @entity2 feature			1
the alleged ransomware attacks are thought to have originated in @entity27 , but reports have also been spotted worldwide			1
hackers are accessing users ' @entity22 accounts , stock image pictured , to enable the @entity2 feature and remotely get access to any connected devices find my @entity2 helps users locate and protect their @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity37 , or @entity38 - if it ’s ever lost or stolen			1
with @entity2 set up on a device , it locates a device on a map , can play a sound to help users find their phone , use @entity45 to lock and track it , or remotely delete all personal information			1
with @entity47 or later , @entity2 includes a feature called @entity49 , which is turned on automatically when @entity2 is switched on			2
activation lock makes it harder for anyone to use or sell an @entity2 , @entity3 , or @entity37 if it ’s lost or stolen			0
with @entity49 , the @entity53 and password are required before anyone can disable @entity2 , sign out of @entity22 , or erase and reactivate the device			1
the attacks began last week in @entity27 , but customers from across the globe have reported the hack on official @entity62 support forums and tech sites			1
based on these reports , criminals are hacking into @entity22 accounts from a browser , before locating connected devices using the @entity2 feature			1
in some instances , customers have multiple @entity62 products including iphones , @entity3 , ipods and @entity38 attached to the same account			0
the hackers , operating under the name ' @entity76 ' , are then enabling @entity77 to shut the devices down remotely			2
this feature lets people send messages to thieves , for example , letting them know that the phone has been locked			0
in this instance , hackers are personalising these messages to demand $ 100 in ransom money to release the devices			1
the hack only works on handsets that have the @entity2 feature switched on , and this is accessible in @entity93			2
@entity62 told the @entity94 : ‘ @entity62 takes security very seriously and @entity22 was not compromised during this incident			2
the hack only works on handsets that have the @entity2 feature switched on , pictured left			2
once the @entity2 feature is enabled via @entity22 , the hackers , operating under the name ' @entity76 ' locate the device on a map before selecting @entity45 , pictured right , and remotely locking the phone ransomware is a type of malware that infects a system and prevents the owner from getting access to it			1
hackers then demand ransom money for the restriction to be removed			1
some forms of ransomware encrypt files on the hard drive , while others lock the system			0
the malware is usually installed as a trojan , via a downloaded file or security flaw in a program or network			0
in june last year , security firm @entity125 said it collected more than 250,000 unique samples of ransomware in the first quarter - double the number it obtained during the same period the year before			0
‘ impacted users should change their @entity53 password as soon as possible and avoid using the same user name and password for multiple services			0
' any users who need additional help can contact @entity136 or visit their local @entity137			0
’ to change an @entity53 , go to appleid.apple.com and follow the steps to reset the password			0
users that have a passcode on their @entity144 devices can remove @entity45 in @entity93 , using this pin			0
although the attacks began last week , they show no signs of stopping			0
they appear to be scam in which hackers are stealing details from other websites and using the same login details to access as many accounts as possible - including @entity22			2
it highlights , again , the need to have different login details for different accounts .			0

attacks are thought to have originated in @entity27 and *spread* worldwide
hackers , under the name ‘ @entity76 ’ are accessing users ’ @entity22 accounts to enable the find my @entity2 feature
once enabled , they lock the phone remotely and demand ransom money
this pop - up can be programmed to say a personalised message
