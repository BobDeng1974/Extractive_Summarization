poor old @entity1 , supporters can be cruel			1
he ’s one of those players for whom cheers are perhaps worse than boos , knowing as he must the irony that they carry			1
he was given what must have seemed to the uninitiated a nice reception when his place in @entity12 ’s starting line - up was announced			1
no - one else in his side came close to drawing such a reaction , and neither did any player in the @entity18 squad			1
his £ 7million move to @entity20 in 2010 , sight unseen , remains one of @entity25 football ’s great curiosities			1
but here he is , recruited by a side who completed a domestic treble last season and who came within a penalty shootout of winning the @entity32			1
but he knows that with the riches of a stay at @entity20 he has also earned a certain amount of ridicule in this country			2
of course , it ’s faintly ludicrous and quite obviously unfair			2
he did n’t set the amount , he did n’t choose to be less than spectacular in four years at @entity56			2
his judgements were never the ones in question			2
but he will always be a figure of fun because he was a central aspect of a strange transfer that did not come off			2
and so it transpired at the @entity64 on sunday afternoon			2
his touches were cheered , none more so than at the end of the first half when he took possession on the right and left @entity73 on his backside			0
his cross to @entity76 bobbled a touch but it was just about fine			0
manager : @entity18 head coach @entity80 contemplates his side 's performance as they go1 - 0 down transfer : former @entity20 forward @entity1 moved to @entity12 for less than half what @entity20 paid for him escape : goal - scorer @entity38 escapes the attentions of @entity18 's @entity88 during their @entity90 match @entity18 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity91 ; @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 ; @entity96 , @entity88 ; @entity97 , @entity73 , @entity98 ; @entity99 @entity12 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity100 ; @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 ; @entity105 , @entity1 ; @entity76 , @entity38 , @entity106			1
that was the highlight ; the rest acceptable			0
he swapped flanks a few times , occasionally taking the ball and getting up on his toes , jinking a little here , dropping a shoulder there			0
then , as it looked like he might try something , he ’d give a simple pass , usually backwards			0
no frills , no great effect			0
in all , he was neither good nor bad			0
but then no - one was , except perhaps @entity76			1
he made @entity12 ’s opener by robbing a defender and squaring for @entity38 to finish			1
@entity98 , also a fine player , hit the post at the other end , before @entity76 rattled the underside of the bar for @entity12			1
@entity1 was part of the move , but only in a very minor way			0
he was cheered for his role , though			0
handbags at dawn : @entity12 's @entity103 goes head - to - head with @entity18 's @entity136 cushion : @entity96 celebrates scoring @entity18 's third , giving his side a two - goal cushion @entity141 equalised in the second half for @entity18 and @entity98 then put them in front			1
@entity145 , like @entity98 , profited from @entity147 ’s questionable goalkeeping and made it 3 - 1			1
and @entity1 ? he kept at it and had a shot blocked in the second half			0
his runs got a bit more purposeful and he actually linked up play quite well			0
but by the then the cheers had stopped , starting up again only when he was substituted in the 70th minute			0
maybe he ’ll come good in @entity156 and shock everyone			0

@entity12 lost 5 - 1 to @entity159 *yesterday*
@entity38 puts @entity12 1 - 0 up
@entity141 equalises for @entity18
@entity98 and @entity96 score to put @entity18 ahead
