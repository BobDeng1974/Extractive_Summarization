by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity2 ’s failure to have any impact against @entity4 on wednesday night and coach @entity6 ’s inability to do anything about it dominated the inquest into @entity12 ’s dismal @entity11 exit			1
' he ran only one mile more than goalkeeper @entity13 ' ran one headline as post-match statistics revealed the @entity16 had covered 4.2 miles during the game - half that of @entity4 matchwinner @entity18			1
' we were n’t really interested in @entity21 having a lot of participation in the game ' were the words that will come back to haunt @entity6 after the 1 - 0 defeat			1
he had been asked why @entity2 saw so little of the ball in @entity4 's win			1
the coach also underwhelmed when asked about the pattern of games against @entity4 this season			1
in five matches @entity45 have scored twice and been unable to beat @entity52 ’s team			0
' i see no reason why the next match will be any different , ' said @entity6 to the exasperation of most @entity12 supporters			1
that next game against @entity4 will be @entity45 ’s last match of the domestic season and one they will probably need to win to retain their title			2
under fire : @entity12 boss @entity6 was criticised for his deployment of @entity2 on wednesday night over and out : @entity12 missed out on a place in the @entity11 semi-finals to their @entity67 rivals @entity2 has failed to scored against @entity4 in the five matches played and finished woefully from several opportunities in the @entity37 on wednesday night but the @entity16 is the least of @entity12 ’s problems			1
they need to rebuild in defensive and goalkeeping positions but are prevented from doing so by their year - long transfer ban			0
supporters will now put the club under huge pressure to bring in a new coach or even call elections and vote in a new president			0
only a win in next week ’s @entity84 final will calm their supporters , but with @entity86 struggling for fitness and @entity88 definitely out their defensive frailties will mean they start the game as clear underdogs			0
for the first time since 2011 , @entity2 has gone four games without scoring ; the more revealing statistic , however , is the distance he covered on wednesday night			0
there seem to be only two possible reasons behind a perceived lack of effort - one is that he was hampering an injury , the other is that he wants to keep as much in reserve for @entity105 ’s @entity104 campaign			0
many players have appeared to do the same in recent years : @entity109 legend @entity108 had his worst season at @entity45 before excelling at the 2002 @entity104 ; and @entity111 was player of the tournament in 2006 after a relatively low - key finish to @entity115 ’s domestic season			0
@entity2 has never quite replicated his @entity12 form on the international stage			2
for a player who has it all for his club , an end - of - season rest may an attempt to go for broke in @entity109			0
@entity123 winner : @entity18 fired home the only goal of the game after five minutes to send @entity4 into the last four marching on : @entity18 celebrates his winning goal with former @entity12 forward @entity130			2

@entity2 ran 4.2 miles during the 1 - 0 @entity11 loss to @entity4
coach @entity6 was unable to affect the situation
@entity12 have played @entity4 five times this season and not won
the @entity4 side went through to the semi-finals 2 - 1 on *aggregate*
