mr @entity100 , who was the senior investigating officer in the case , said april ’s family reported she had been abducted at 7.20pm on october 1 last year - prompting a ' significant police response '			1

' the family plan to place the remains in a pink coffin and take them through the town of @entity122 , @entity75 , on a horse drawn carriage			0

hundreds of people are expected to turn up to say their farewells to the little girl , with a possible venue being @entity146 in @entity10			0
