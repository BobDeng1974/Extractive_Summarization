' politicised ' : former @entity1 chief @entity0 , pictured donations to the @entity1 have dropped by more than £ 7million after the charity was accused of betraying its traditional core support for contentious political issues			1
the backlash follows a controversial period for the @entity1 , which has been pursuing campaigns against hunting , the badger cull and the @entity11			1
it has also been accused of bullying tactics in bringing prosecutions for animal cruelty			1
and there has been a power vacuum at the top of the organisation since @entity0 , the chief executive who presided over the charity ’s new direction , unexpectedly left his post in february due to ill health			2
his deputy , @entity25 , left six weeks later			0
critics of the @entity1 ’s decision to campaign on politicised issues say the drop in donations indicates that it needs to refocus on traditional concerns			1
latest accounts show the charity is in financial crisis and losing support from the public and grassroots members			2
accounts posted on the @entity1 website show a fall in cash from voluntary income , with receipts down from £ 112.4 million to £ 105.4 million			1
cash from legacies was down £ 5.7 million , while individual gifts fell by £ 1.2 million			2
at the same time , membership fees fell by £ 34,000 , or six per cent , from £ 590,000 to £ 556,000			2
the charity ’s overall operating income also slumped by more than £ 11 million , from £ 132.8 million to £ 121.2 million			0
this was due to rising costs for fuel , veterinary fees and private boarding costs incurred where there was no room at its centres to care for animals			0
in a statement last week , @entity1 council chairman @entity60 said the figures were ‘ clearly unsustainable and show things can not continue to carry on as they are ’			1
he told staff the charity needed to save £ 4.5 million and jobs would be cut from the 1,568 workforce			0
although the new plans have not yet been finalised , the charity intends to focus on animal rescue work			0
it is also planning new money - making ventures so it does not have to rely on individuals leaving donations in their wills			0
how the @entity76 reported the @entity78 case in 2012 but it is not yet clear if the organisation intends to cut back on controversial prosecutions , such as its decision to bring a £ 326,000 private case against the @entity78 in @entity84 in december 2012			1
although the case was successful , the judge suggested the public might feel the cash spent ‘ can be more usefully employed ’			0
sir @entity88 , of the @entity89 , said : ‘ the @entity1 has undertaken high - profile , political campaigns on subjects such as hunting , the badger cull , live exports and horse - racing – campaigns we feel have done little to further animal welfare and should not be the priority of the @entity1			1
we hope it will reconsider how it spends donors ’ money			0
’ an @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we have seen periods where we are cash - rich , and leaner times when people tighten their belts			2
but we are prepared to make difficult decisions			0
