for more than a century , this historic clock 's chimes have been part of village life , day and night			2
but they are about to be partially silenced in the latest example of health and safety gone mad – after a complaint from a couple who recently bought the house next door			2
the decision in @entity14 , @entity15 , was last night slated as a ' politically correct health - and - safety purge ' by communities secretary @entity17 , who said he was issuing new guidance to councils to prevent it happening again			1
battlefield : @entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 , a legal expert who moved in to the house , four months ago first , mr @entity23 , who works as a case manager at the @entity26 , complained to the trust that manages @entity22 – the community hall on top of which the three - faced clock stands ' if people do n't like the chime of a bell that has sounded for generations , they should reflect on whether they want to live next door to it in the first place or consider the merits of double glazing , ' the minister told the @entity43			1
the row began shortly after legal expert @entity23 , 44 , and his accountant wife @entity46 , 41 , moved to @entity14 from a nearby village last september			1
first , mr @entity23 , who works as a case manager at the @entity26 , complained to the trust that manages @entity22 – the community hall on top of which the three - faced clock stands			1
then he contacted the parish council and @entity52 , threatening to sue because the chimes , which have sounded every 15 minutes since 1900 , had left the couple unable to sleep and ' depressed '			1
the trust was advised it would probably lose if the case went to court			2
so it has now had to buy a bespoke timer for £ 1,700 plus installation costs to stop the chimes between 11pm and 7am			1
however , in an inspiring show of community spirit , villagers have chipped in with donations to meet the fee , despite being outraged by the move			2
the chimes on the clock at @entity22 in @entity14 , @entity15 , have sounded every 15 minutes since 1900 the trust has now had to buy a bespoke timer for £ 1,700 plus installation costs to stop the chimes @entity73 , of the hall 's management committee said : ' there 's a lot of resentment that someone can come into a place and stop something that 's been going on for 100 years without any real feel for the community in general			1
' people have powerful memories of the hall and the clock			2
it has been a venue for wedding receptions , for all sorts of events and groups			0
in the @entity94 ladies gathered there to write letters to men at the front			0
' @entity99 , chairman of @entity100 , said : ' to my mind it 's " buyer beware "			0
you ca n't really miss the clock – it 's 90ft tall and right next door			0
' mr @entity17 's department has now drafted guidance to councils that the local character of a place should be taken into account during noise disputes			0
' in recent years , too many town halls have been over-zealous in trying to silence church bells and village clocks which have chimed for decades , if not centuries , ' he said			0
' we need some common sense to recognise such sounds are part of the fabric of @entity122 's life , rather than trying to whitewash all the character out of our heritage			0
' mr @entity23 insisted he did not know the clock chimed every 15 minutes when he bought the house for £ 295,950 after just one viewing			1
' we changed the double glazing and paid for sound - proofing but it 's still not working , ' he said			0
' i do n't think there 's any point that they should chime after 11pm			0

@entity23 , 44 , and his wife @entity46 , 41 , moved to @entity14 last september
the legal expert first complained to the trust that manages @entity22
he then contacted the parish council and @entity52 council
threatened to sue as chimes left couple unable to sleep and ' depressed '
chimes had sounded every 15 minutes since 1900 but will do no *longer*
villagers said there was a ' lot of resentment ' but chipped in to buy a timer
