it is a terrifying moment for any man - as they lean down on one knee and fumble to open that tiny velvet box ... their whole future dependent on the answer to a four - word question			0
but now it has become clear just how risky proposing to the woman you love really is			0
a new survey has shown that nearly one in four women have turned down at least one marriage proposal during their lifetime			1
a new survey has revealed that one in four women have turned down a marriage proposal in their lifetime , with the top reason being that the man was n't ' @entity21 ' ( picture posed by models ) the most common reasons are because they feared the proposer was n't ' the one ' , that it ' did n't feel right ' or that their partner was n't taking the proposal seriously enough			1
others even said they have rejected a proposal because they thought it was nothing more than a joke			1
but 23 per cent of people who have declined a proposal admitted they 'd regretted the decision later on			1
it also emerged 59 per cent of men feel nervous at the prospect of proposing to their partner , with 15 per cent admitting that the thought made them break out in a cold sweat			0
almost one in three women also revealed that they would turn down a marriage proposal if the man had n't gone to enough effort while popping the question ( pictured posed by model ) one man even recorded his own heart rate leading up to , during and after proposing during a break to @entity54 , with his pulse spiking at 131 beats a minute as he got down on one knee			1
a spokesperson for travel firm @entity58 , who commissioned the research , said : ' we realise that proposing is a big decision for most people and the survey results clearly show this			1
' it can take a long time to pluck up the courage to pop the question and to not hear the answer you are hoping for can be difficult			0
' and it seems many women will turn down a proposal simply because it was n't done in the way they were hoping			1
' so if you are planning to propose , make sure you have an idea of what your partner would like and hopefully you will be celebrating hearing ' yes '			0
' of the @entity82 questioned over their proposal experiences , 37 of women revealed they had been proposed to twice in their lifetime and 12 per cent admitted men had asked for their hand in marriage no less than three times			1
i was n't certain they were the one 2			1
it just did n't feel right 3			2
i do n't / did n't want to get married 4			2
it did n't feel like they meant it 5			2
i did n't think we 'd been in a relationship long enough 6			2
we 'd already split up and they were trying to win me back 7			0
i was worried about what other people would think 8			0
i did n't think we could afford it 9			2
i thought it was a joke 10			0
i did n't think my partner was taking it seriously enough while issues over the condition of the relationship were most likely to solicit a ' no ' from the woman in question , the research has shown that the effort that goes into the proposal is also a big factor			1
29 per cent of women admitted they would turn down their partner just on the basis of the proposal itself being poor			1
52 per cent revealed they were hoping for a traditional ' down on one knee ' proposal and 20 per cent wanted an ' all - singing , all - dancing ' proposal			0
it also emerged just 22 per cent of men actually planned to , or did , spend the traditional two months ' salary on a ring for their partner			0
one in ten men do n't intend to spend a great amount on a ring saying that they ' do n't see the need for a ring			0
' the study found the most romantic destinations for proposing to a partner are @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity54 .			0
