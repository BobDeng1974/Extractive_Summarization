by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ' failure to deliver @entity5 football at @entity6 has directly benefited their rivals @entity7 , who as a result have jumped into the advantageous pot two			2
@entity6 , @entity11 and @entity12 will all have no involvement next season , which sees @entity7 rise to the second group of seeds			1
the @entity19 giants and @entity6 all boast higher @entity21 coefficients than @entity7 , meaning @entity23 's side - as well as @entity25 ' @entity24 - move up a pot by virtue of the big three 's absence , noticeably enhancing their chances			1
all smiles ! @entity7 will be in pot two for next season 's @entity5 group stage draw cheers ! city were aided after @entity6 's disastrous campaign under ex-boss @entity3 pot one : @entity38 * pot two : @entity7 pot three : @entity40 pot four : @entity41 pot one : @entity42 pot two : @entity7 pot three : @entity44 pot four : @entity45 * assumes that team progresses through qualification stages they reached the last - 16 of the competition after coming behind @entity50 from the third pot last year			1
their initial seeding meant the potential of topping the group was slim from the off , in turn seeing @entity7 knocked out by @entity58 after finishing second in the first stage			0
the @entity61 champions will now forgo tricky assignments against one of @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity24			0
although pot three 's quality is strong , it means - in theory at least - that only one side stand in their way of finishing first in a group			0
@entity77 , meanwhile , find themselves in pot three after tumbling down to 32nd in @entity21 's coefficient rankings through a lack of @entity82 football in the 2013 - 14 season			2
it represents a tricky return to the continent 's premier competition for the @entity88 - back after a five - year absence - who will definitely face one of @entity42 , @entity50 , @entity58 , @entity92 , @entity38 or @entity93 in the group stage			0
first time for everything : @entity7 managed to finish second in their group last season we 're in ! @entity77 , thanks in part to @entity101 , will again compete in the continent 's premier competition pot one : @entity38 pot two : @entity24 * pot three : @entity77 pot four : @entity41 pot one : @entity42 pot two : @entity66 pot three : @entity77 pot four : @entity45 * assumes that team progresses through qualification stages does n't look too bad : @entity109 's @entity108 will again be in pot one when the draw takes place @entity113 and @entity108 appear safe as houses in pot one - providing @entity117 's side can maneuver their way through a two - legged play - off in august			1
if they can , it 'll be the @entity123 ' 17th consecutive season in the hat - a record only matched by @entity42			0
no @entity127 sides can face each other in a group , although there is the possibility of facing @entity133 's @entity132 , who would be in pot four alongside the likes of @entity41 , @entity45 and @entity137			0
pot one : @entity113 / @entity108 pot two : @entity69 pot three : @entity40 pot four : @entity41 pot one : @entity113 / @entity108 pot two : @entity66 pot three : @entity44 pot four : @entity45 easy street : @entity142 winners @entity113 should qualify for their 17th consecutive season in the @entity5 should make it : @entity133 's @entity132 need to qualify but if they do will be in pot four			1

@entity6 failed to qualify for @entity21 under @entity147
@entity150 's side have a better @entity21 coefficient than @entity7
that means @entity23 's team jump into second pot of seeds
champions were also helped by @entity11 and @entity12 failing to qualify
@entity77 are in pot three , with @entity108 and @entity113 in pot one
@entity132 will be in pot four if they progress through qualification play - off
