‘ i believe all four wheels of the vehicle left the ground and we landed heavily in the @entity63			1

’ pc @entity37 said he then became aware of a cyclist who was travelling in the same direction as the police van , around one metre away from the kerb			0

he added : ‘ through that admission he accepts that his driving on this day in march fell below that of a competent and careful driver			0
‘ the prosecution however allege that his conduct amounts to more than careless driving but that of dangerous driving			1
‘ and what is alleged in this case is that the defendant ’s driving was to fall far below the standard expected of a competent and careful driver and that it would be obvious to a careful and competent driver that driving in that way would be dangerous			2

‘ @entity59 was responding to this call for assistance but in my opinion he misjudged the severity of the hazard that was presented by the bridge , approaching as he did at 68mph			0
‘ it was because of that speed he was unable to retain proper control of his vehicle as he approached the brow of the bridge			2
