by @entity0 have you ever thought about how fast you ’re spinning on @entity3 ’s axis ? even when you finally relax in front of the tv , you ’re still spinning at a dizzying speed of over 600mph if you ’re in the @entity7			2
using this map , you can search for where your line of latitude crosses the black curve to determine the speed you ’re spinning in the cosmos			0
using this map , you can search for where your line of latitude crosses the black curve to determine the speed you ¿ re spinning in the cosmos the graphic was created by @entity19 - based @entity18 who wanted to find a way for people think about their existence in a broader sense			2
according to the graphic , the speed at which your area of the planet is moving can vary between 0 and 1040mph			1
‘ basically , i 'm a geologist who loves math , ’ mr @entity18 told @entity28			0
‘ every once in a while , i tackle a fun thought experiment or back - of - the - envelope calculation related to the natural world			0
’ the result was the graphic that reveals the speed of a point on @entity3 's surface for any given latitude as a result of the rotation of the @entity3 about its axis			1
the values on the graph are accurate to within about 1 mph ( 1.6 km / hr ) of your actual speed			0
it does not take into account our rotation around the sun into account , which is roughly 67,000 mph orbital speed			0
even when you finally relax in front of the tv after a long day , you 're still spinning at a dizzying speed of over 600mph if you 're in the @entity7 an object on the @entity3 's equator travels once around the @entity3 's circumference			1
this is about 24,901 miles ( 40,075 kilometres ) per day			1
to calculate speed , mr @entity18 divided that distance by 23hr , 56m , 4s to reach the figure of 1,040 mph			1
after that , speed due to rotation was calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude at the point			1
‘ the largest error introduced is probably the fact that you have to estimate your location on the curve based on where you live , then read your speed off the x-axis , ’ said mr @entity18			0

the calculation assumes that the @entity3 is a perfect sphere , which is n’t the case			0
. there is also some variability in speed introduced by the altitude of a given location , but the effect is very minor			0
‘ if , hypothetically , @entity103 ’s peak and the deepest part of the @entity105 were both located along the equator , the difference in tangential speed caused by the 12.3 mile elevation difference would only be about 3 mph , ’ said mr @entity18			2
‘ i am partial to maps because my education focused heavily on geographic information systems , ’ said mr @entity18			0
‘ but sometimes all you need is a good graph to make the data beautiful			0
