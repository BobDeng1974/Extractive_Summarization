there is an 800lb elephant in the room for this @entity4 semi-final in the shape of @entity6 , but my advice would be : do n’t make it personal			1
@entity11 ’s match with @entity12 will be won between the lines of the tennis court , although there is no doubt it can be strange for all concerned when a coach switches corners			1
i experienced this in 2003 in my first match as a coach against @entity22 following our eight - year association			2
i was working with @entity25 at @entity26 and he won in three sets against @entity22			0
the whole experience gave me a vaguely sick feeling			0
@entity11 celebrates his straight sets win over @entity31 in the quarter - finals @entity11 is set to come up against his long - term friend @entity6 , who now coaches @entity12 the key to this match is whether @entity11 can maintain the more aggressive style he has been playing			1
the stats do n’t lie and there is a reason @entity40 has a 4 - 6 record against the @entity42 : too often he has tried to beat him relying on his more defensive game and most of the time it has not worked			1
if i was coaching @entity40 , i would tell him he needs to keep playing ‘ first - strike ’ tennis — being aggressive with the first ball that is there to hit			0
he has to take the ball on if it is anywhere near the centre of the court , and must avoid giving @entity12 ‘ meatballs ’ , those more passive plays that give him the chance to belt heavy groundstroke winners			1
the second serve will be crucial for @entity40			0
he has been averaging 87mph on it here as opposed to 84mph in 2014 — an improvement , but still not enough by the highest standards			0
@entity59 tends to average around 100mph and @entity11 needs to get closer to that			1
@entity12 is @entity11 's next opponent after he saw off @entity61 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 in the quarter - finals @entity11 , working on his serve in practice on wednesday , will have to serve well against the big hitting @entity42 if the @entity42 has a weakness , it is that his second serve tends to be the most predictable of the top 10 , but there are already signs @entity69 is doing a good job coaching him			1
@entity12 is picking when to really go for a winner much better			1
before he would strike out too soon , especially when out wide , but now he is more intelligent			0
another key for @entity73 is that , at 29 , he has improved his movement around the court significantly			0
conditions are going to play a part			0
if , as expected , it is a cool evening and the ball flies relatively slowly , that favours the greater power of @entity12			2
but if it is significantly breezy , then @entity11 ’s control is superior in the wind			2
put me on the spot and i will say that there will be four tight sets , with the @entity89 going through to another final			0
the two - time @entity92 champion has been in fine form so far in @entity94 , aiming for a fourth final			2

@entity11 faces @entity12 in @entity4 semis on *thursday*
the @entity99 is coached by @entity11 's friend @entity6
@entity11 has a 4 - 6 head - to - head record against @entity12
the winner will face @entity59 or @entity105 in the final
