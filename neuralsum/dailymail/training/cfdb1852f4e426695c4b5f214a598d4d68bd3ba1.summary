as he watched tv reports on a 33 - year - old missing - child case , a man who 'd never been a suspect started pondering whether he was the killer , he later told a psychologist			1
'' did i ( do ) it ? ''			0
it was just a thought that came into my head , ' @entity7 recalls in the psychologist 's report , part of a recent court filing that adds new details about his defense in a case that galvanized the missing - children 's movement			1
' i was , like , nervous and questioning myself ... trying to make sense			0
' @entity7 would soon tell police he did choke six - year - old @entity21 in 1979 , confessing after investigators were tipped that he 'd spoken of having harmed a child			1
' did i do it ? ' : @entity7 , who admitted to killing @entity21 in 1979 in a taped confession , told a psychologist that he questioned himself over the murder after seeing a missing persons report on tv but defense psychological experts later found him unsure of whether the brutal scenario he 'd described was real or imaginary			1
' i believed it in my mind that i did it , but i do n't think i did it , ' @entity7 , 53 , told one psychologist			1
the interplay between belief and reality is shaping up to be a central issue in his murder trial , set for early next year			2
since a judge ruled this week that jurors could hear @entity7 's confession , it will be up to them to decide whether it was true			1
his defense says it was fiction from a man with an iq in the bottom 2 percent of the population and mental illness that makes it difficult for him to distinguish real life from fantasy			0
prosecutors say his confession was legitimate , and they 're seeking to limit proposed expert testimony on the psychological phenomenon of false confessions			0
1979 crime : @entity7 has pleaded not guilty to murder in the strangling death of @entity21 , who was one of the first missing persons to be placed on a milk carton ' we believe the evidence that mr. @entity7 killed @entity21 to be credible and persuasive and that his statements are not the product of any mental illness , ' the @entity70 district attorney 's office has said			1
@entity75 vanished while walking to his school bus stop may 25 , 1979 , now memorialized as @entity77			1
@entity7 then worked at a nearby corner store			0
@entity75 was never found , and the investigation spanned decades			0
after police followed an ultimately fruitless lead to a @entity70 basement in april 2012 - the news @entity7 watched on tv - they got a tip about him			1
authorities eventually learned that in the 1980s , the @entity89 , @entity90 , man apparently told a friend , his now - ex - wife and a church prayer circle he 'd hurt an unnamed child in @entity95			2
one listener remembers him saying he 'd dismembered a boy , another recalls him describing strangling a child after being hit with a ball , and even the child 's race varied , according to one of three recently filed defense psychologist 's reports			2
but after more than six hours of police questioning , @entity7 gave a calm , consistent account to police and prosecutors on video in may 2012 : he choked @entity75 , put the still - living boy into a plastic bag , stuffed the bag in a box and dumped it on a street			1
' i felt like something just took over me , ' he said			0
unanswered questions : @entity75 's parents @entity121 ( left ) and @entity122 ( right ) have been attending @entity7 's trial but after more than six hours of police questioning , @entity7 gave a calm , consistent account to police and prosecutors on video in may 2012 : he choked @entity75 , put the still - living boy into a plastic bag , stuffed the bag in a box and dumped it on a street			1
six - year - old @entity21 disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in @entity70 in 1979 ' i felt like something just took over me , ' he said			1
@entity7 has taken anti-psychotic medication for about a decade , and he 's been diagnosed most recently with schizotypal personality disorder			0
characteristics include social isolation and odd beliefs			0
he told police he 's seen visions of his late mother			1
he told defense doctors he has heard voices commanding him intermittently since his teens , seen furniture move on its own and observed people others do n't see hanging out around his house			0
he told defense doctors that a voice told him to approach @entity75 and that several mysterious people followed along during the attack , though he also said the memory ' feels like a dream , ' according to the psychologists ' reports			0
' his delusional thinking and hallucinatory experiences could have easily caused him to convince himself he was somehow responsible for the boy 's death when in fact he was not , ' defense psychologist @entity159 wrote			0
he said @entity7 's psychological problems and intellectual limitations put him ' at much greater risk than others ' of falsely confessing			2
prosecutors dispute his conclusion , and they asked a judge this month to limit any potential false confession expert testimony to factors accepted by the ' scientific community , ' citing a @entity95 legal standard			2
@entity7 's lawyer , @entity176 , said in court papers the testimony will meet the criteria			2
prosecutors have n't disclosed their own psychologists ' evaluations			0
but they 've noted that @entity7 was never hospitalized for psychological problems before his arrest and that he 'd shown the mental wherewithal to hold jobs , apply for government benefits and discuss religion .			0

@entity21 disappeared in 1979 walking to his school bus stop in @entity95
