by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 06:11 est , 25 august 2012 @entity1 last night insisted she wanted @entity2 to stay in the euro amid rumours that @entity5 was planning a ‘ temporary ’ exit for the country			1
the @entity5 chancellor sought to reassure @entity2 prime minister @entity9 over the country ’s future in the single currency as it lurches closer to the abyss			1
but at crisis talks in @entity16 she refused to give @entity2 more time to tackle its ballooning debts			1
@entity2 's prime minister @entity9 ( left ) is in talks with @entity5 's chancellor @entity1 ( right ) to secure more time to make painful financial cuts speculative reports on the internet claimed the @entity5 finance minister @entity24 was drawing up plans for @entity2 to leave temporarily while it straightens out its finances			2
however , there is thought to be strong opposition among key @entity31 officials in @entity32 and @entity33 and it is unlikely any such move would happen this year			0
[ related analysts in @entity37 dismissed the rumours			0
a spokesman for @entity41 firm @entity40 said : ‘ a temporary exit is the stuff of fantasy because a temporary exit will expose the same chain reaction links that an outright exit would , with the same painful consequences for all			0
’ @entity1 and @entity51 president @entity50 , meeting a day before @entity9 came to @entity16 , put the onus squarely on @entity2 to fulfill its pledges mr @entity9 , who meets @entity51 president @entity50 in @entity55 today , is desperate to secure ‘ breathing space ’ for @entity2 to get its finances under control			2
in the @entity5 and @entity51 media this week , mr @entity9 has been arguing that his country should have more time beyond the mid- 2014 deadline to complete reforms that are a condition of it continuing to receive bailout loans			0
without the help , @entity2 would be forced into a chaotic default on its debts and could be forced out of the eurozone			2
but mrs @entity1 said : ‘ we will not make premature judgments but will await reliable evidence ’ – meaning the report by international inspectors into the country ’s finances due this autumn			0
she added : ‘ @entity2 is part of the eurozone and i want @entity2 to remain part of the eurozone			2
’ protesters against the cuts try to enter the parliament during a 24 - hours general strike in @entity87 in february leading @entity5 politicians have voiced deep skepticism about granting @entity2 any concessions			1
@entity1 and @entity51 president @entity50 , meeting a day before @entity9 came to @entity16 , put the onus squarely on @entity2 to fulfill its pledges			0
@entity87 has faltered in the speed and effectiveness of implementing the reforms - irritating creditors , notably @entity5 , which is the single largest contributor to its 240 billion euro ( $ 300 billion ) bailout packages			1
weeks of political wrangling in @entity2 that ultimately brought a coalition government under @entity9 to power did n't help			1
@entity2 's continued access to the bailout packages hinges on a favorable report next month from the so - called ' troika ' of the country 's debt inspectors - the @entity109 , @entity110 and the @entity108			0
if @entity2 is found to have failed on key economic reforms that are conditions of the bailout loan , vital funds could be halted			1

@entity87 has irritated creditors with slow reforms
