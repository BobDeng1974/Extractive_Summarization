today marks 81 years since the notorious ' @entity0 ' , which claimed to show evidence of a monster living in @entity3 , was published in the @entity4			1
and to celebrate , @entity5 has launched its latest @entity7 experience that lets you virtually explore both above and beneath the water in the iconic @entity11 waterway			1
the tech giant has also released a @entity13 to commemorate the anniversary and changed the yellow @entity15 to a @entity0 peg - monster			1
the site has launched to mark the 81st anniversary of the ' @entity0 ' - an image of the mythical monster from 1934 - and it lets people virtually explore above and beneath the water of the attraction to the southwest of @entity31 to collect the images , @entity5 partnered with @entity18 and @entity19 from the @entity3 and @entity20 - a project set up to explore the loch and investigate all alleged sightings			1
' like the world 's best legends , the @entity0 transcends the everyday and exists at the edges of possibility , ' said @entity5 in a blog post			1
' whether or not you believe , most people hold a romanticised vision of the creature that , legend has it , plumbs the depths of the loch			0
' in 1934 , the ' @entity0 ' was released , claiming to show the monster in the misty waters of the lake			1
it 's the most iconic photo in the history of @entity3 - and may be one of the most elaborate hoaxes of our age			1
' ' like the world 's best legends , the @entity0 transcends the everyday and exists at the edges of possibility , ' said @entity5 in a blog post			1
' whether or not you believe , most people hold a romanticised vision of a creature that , legend has it , plumbs the depths of the loch @entity5 said there are more searches for @entity3 ( pictured ) than there are for other @entity72 institutions like @entity73 and the @entity74			1
it is formed of a series of interrelated bodies of water , including the @entity78 to the south and the @entity80 to the north @entity3 ( marked ) lies along the @entity82			1
this forms a line of weakness in the rocks which forms the @entity82 and the basins of @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity3 ' today , to celebrate the anniversary of its release , we 're bringing 360 - degree @entity7 imagery of @entity3 to @entity95 , so you can go in search of @entity0 yourself			1
' formed of a series of interrelated bodies of water , including the @entity78 to the south and the @entity80 to the north , @entity3 stretches for 23 miles ( 37 km ) southwest of @entity31			1
although it 's neither the largest @entity11 loch by surface area nor depth , it is the largest by volume , containing more freshwater than all the lakes of @entity109 and @entity110 combined and is almost 800ft ( 243 metres ) deep			0
the @entity0 ( pictured ) was taken in 1934 by colonel @entity111 and published in the @entity4 on 21 april that year			2
it was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants , @entity113 , who , on his deathbed , revealed the pictures were staged the tech giant has also released a @entity13 ( pictured ) to commemorate the anniversary and changed the yellow @entity15 to a @entity0 peg - monster the @entity0 has been the subject of many sightings in the @entity122			1
most , however , have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy			0
some experts believe the beast represents a line of long - surviving plesiosaurs , a type of carnivorous aquatic reptile from millions of years ago , while one of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon , which can grow up to 12ft ( 3.7 metres ) long			2
others include eels , bird wakes , seals , trees , logs , submarines , dogs with sticks - and even an elephant			0

although it 's neither the largest @entity11 loch by surface area nor depth , it is the largest by volume , containing more freshwater than all the lakes of @entity109 and @entity110 combined and is almost 800ft ( 243 meters ) deep this image was taken beneath the waterline at the southern edge of the loch near the @entity78 and shows @entity156			1
from the late nineteenth century to 1998 the abbey was a @entity159 monastery @entity19 has been carrying out fieldwork in the @entity122 since 1973 and has logged 1,000 @entity0 sightings			2
he said : ' the @entity5 project was so cloaked in secrecy , when people asked about the ripples in the loch during the expeditions , i had no opinion ' the @entity0 has been a subject of intrigue and debate since it came to the world 's attention			1
@entity175 took what appears to be a close - up of @entity178 in 2011 ( pictured ) the @entity0 has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to the world 's attention in 1934			1
scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern - day myth , with continued sightings claimed to be set ups and wishful thinking			0
but it has remained a contested phenomenon for 81 years			0
perhaps the most famous picture of @entity0 was taken by colonel @entity111 , a @entity191 gynaecologist			2
it was published in the @entity4 on 21 april 1934 and showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water			0
however , it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from @entity199 with a head and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big - game hunter @entity204 in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his hapless search for the beast			0
the earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of @entity3 appears in the @entity215 by @entity216 , written in the 7th century			1
@entity215 , an @entity217 monk , had sent a disciple into the loch to prove there was nothing there			0
but the monster rose and chased the man snapping at his heels			0
but it fled in terror ' as if pulled back by ropes ' when @entity215 made the sign of the cross and commanded : ' go no further			0
do not touch the man			0
' in november 1933 , @entity232 was the first to picture a creature splashing in the water			0
four stumpy - looking objects on the bottom of the creature 's body appeared to look like appendages , such as flippers , but it was later suggested the creature was a dog , possibly holding a stick			2
in 1938 , @entity244 , a @entity245 tourist , filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16mm colour film			0
his picture was declared ' positive evidence ' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist			0
in 1960 , aeronautical engineer @entity253 filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake			0
mr @entity253 allegedly spotted the animal on his last day hunting for it , and described the object as reddish with a blotch on its side			0
in may 2007 , @entity262 , a 55 - year - old lab technician , captured video of what he said was ' this jet black thing , about 45ft long , moving fairly fast in the water '			2
the film , though , has been cast into doubt			0
mr @entity262 has been criticised for claiming the existence of fairies and another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters swimming in the loch			0
@entity175 took what appears to be a close - up of the @entity0 in 2011			1
in february 2012 , a sonar image of a large mystery object deep below the surface of @entity3 netted boat skipper @entity280 the @entity281 of @entity282 - the first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker @entity283			1
the sonar picture , that shows a large unidentified living object deep underwater , was recorded by @entity3 boat skipper @entity280			2
mr @entity280 ’s sonar fish - finder device records the width of objects in the depths directly below his tourist boat every quarter of a second			0
an online register lists 1,067 total @entity0 sightings			2
the list was created by @entity298 , the man behind the @entity300 @entity299			0
but the @entity302 's photograph is among the most famous			0
a diver from the @entity18 is shown collecting imagery of the loch it was taken in 1934 by colonel @entity111 and published in the @entity4 on 21 april that year , but was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants , @entity113 , who , on his deathbed , revealed the pictures were staged			2
the image turned out to be a toy submarine bought from @entity199 with a head and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big - game hunter @entity204 in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his search for the beast			2
@entity19 has been carrying out fieldwork in the @entity122 since 1973 and has logged more than 1,000 @entity0 sightings			0
he said : ' the @entity5 project was so cloaked in secrecy , when people asked about the ripples in the loch during the special diving expeditions , for once i had no opinion			1
' i 'm so proud to have been part of this initiative and i hope people worldwide enjoy exploring @entity7 to have a look and then be inspired to travel to @entity11 to discover this area of magical beauty and natural intrigue			1
' @entity342 chief executive @entity341 added : ' @entity344 project is hugely exciting and we are delighted the team at @entity5 have been as inspired about our monster as the hundreds and thousands of visitors who travel to @entity3 every year hoping to catch a glimpse			1
' @entity351 carried out 20 years ago estimated the @entity0 phenomenon having an economic impact of £ 40 million ( $ 59 million ) to the @entity11 economy			0
with inflation , this figure would have risen to £ 60 million ( $ 89 million ) by now			0
and @entity5 said there are more searches for @entity3 than there are for other @entity72 institutions like @entity73 and the @entity74			1
' wherever you stand on the @entity0 debate , the legend lives on - even in the digital era			2
sail across the freshwater lake and take in its haunting beauty , made darker still by the peat particles found in its waters , ' the site continued			0
' let the @entity3 unlock the spirit of your imagination , where the rippling water , tricks of the light , and drifting logs bring the legend of @entity0 to life			1
' you can imagine @entity0 nestling within these dark , peat - filled waters , waiting for the right moment to breach the surface into the @entity11 sunlight above .			2

@entity5 partnered with @entity18 and the @entity3 and @entity20 to capture the @entity7 shots
site has launched to mark the 81st anniversary of the ' @entity0 ' - an image of the mythical monster
it lets people virtually explore above and beneath the water of the iconic waterway to the southwest of @entity31
there are more searches for @entity3 than any other @entity72 institution , and @entity5 's *doodle* also marks the *occasion*
