freshman cornerback , @entity8 , 19 , quit the football team on november 6 after coach @entity10 called him profanities and once even threatened to ' head - butt him during a study hall session			1
' there were 10 students and a tutor present during the incident			0
@entity8 's parents , @entity19 and @entity20 , are outraged by the ' bullying ' and are seeking disciplinary action against @entity10			1
@entity2 defensive coordinator @entity10 is accused of severely bullying and excluding one of his players ' i really think disciplinary action should happen , almost to the point where ( @entity10 ) should get fired			0
i really do , ' @entity29 told @entity30 ' he was just trying to really make me feel as if i was soft			2
' he got all up in my face			0
coach @entity10 has a lisp , so he was in my face telling me he 'll head - butt me , and he was kind of spitting in my face as he was saying it			0
i was just pulling my head back , looking at him like , is this guy out of his mind ? is he crazy ? , ' @entity8 told @entity30			1
@entity8 quit the team on november 6 after months of name - calling and exclusion from team practice the school issued a statement about the alleged bullying that said , ' at no time was there any threat of physical violence , which was verified by an academic counselor , who was present in the room			1
' the statement also said that the head coach , @entity51 , spoke with @entity10 about his behavior and that the next day the coach apologized			2
@entity8 's parents were not placated by the statement which says that they met with the school several times and felt that the issue was resolved			1
the statement claimed that athletic director @entity60 spoke with @entity8 's father and that they , ' confirmed that the matter was resolved to his satisfaction			1
' the family says this is untrue			0
in fact , @entity29 has been unable to have a meeting with @entity68 despite his numerous attempts			0
@entity60 , @entity70 of @entity2 , did n't make herself available to meet with @entity8 's family even though a statement issued by the school says she did ' we did n't even want this to escalate to the athletic director , ' @entity29 told @entity77			1
' we were trying to keep this in - house			0
i was n't trying to go to the [ university ] president and the @entity83			0
i was like , ' hey , let 's try to resolve this			0
' according to @entity29 , @entity51 said , ' mr. @entity8 , i 'm not going to tell you how i discipline my coaches			2
' i understand that , because that 's in - house stuff , but what happens if nothing happens ? how do you know ? where is the letter filed to ( @entity68 ) ? ' in addition to bullying , @entity8 feels as though was given less playing time unfairly			1
he also was n't invited to meetings that secondary coach @entity102 held with the rest of the cornerbacks			2
' obviously , if every single corner ( back ) is going to a meeting and not me , there is something up , ' @entity8 said			2
@entity8 decided to leave the team after @entity111 , the @entity112 , whose secondary had been racked by injuries , played a wide receiver at cornerback against @entity117 instead of @entity8 , reported @entity118			2
the @entity119 rides through the endzone in the game against @entity117 on nov. 2 that @entity8 never got to play @entity8 believes the bullying was instigated after he pulled a hamstring during a 40 - yard dash			2
he thinks this made @entity10 think of him as a less valuable player			0
the bullying escalated over time			0
basically , my dad went in there and told coach @entity10 there 's going to be no more bullying towards me , " @entity8 said			1
" basically that 's what it was -- i was just bullied by him for no reason			0
" @entity2 ' statement may be aimed at trying to save the school 's reputation after they were forced to fire college basketball coach @entity142 for bullying			1
@entity144 reports that @entity142 has since apologized for the bullying incident that got him fired and said , ' there were some actions that were definitely bullying			0

after the video was broadcast on @entity118 , @entity154 governor @entity153 asked @entity2 to fire @entity142			0
the @entity8 family thinks that @entity10 should get the same punishment			1
@entity8 , who is cousins with former @entity160 player @entity159 , wants to continue playing football even if it means he has to transfer schools			1
@entity8 is related to @entity164 player @entity159 who played for the @entity165			1
