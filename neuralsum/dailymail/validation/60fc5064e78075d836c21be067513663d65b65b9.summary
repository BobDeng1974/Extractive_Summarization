mr @entity10 , who lives in @entity20 , has already been rendered unable to speak by his degenerative condition and like @entity29 , he relies on a computer system to communicate			1
his works by moving a cursor with his eyes and blinking to type but doctors have told him his eyes could also give in to the disease , which causes paralysis , and mr @entity39 has made it clear that it is at this point he would not wish to continue living			1
for four years mr @entity10 allowed his filmmaker son @entity14 , 24 , to record his decline in order to raise awareness about the illness and the truth about the devastating impact it has had on his family			1
mr @entity10 , pictured with wife @entity16 and son @entity14 , has already been rendered unable to speak by his degenerative condition mr @entity10 allowed his filmmaker son @entity14 , 24 , to record his decline in order to raise awareness about the illness and the truth about the devastating impact it has had on his family ( pictured ) appearing in @entity57 ’s filming my father : in @entity60 , mr @entity10 , tells the camera : ‘ if i am no longer able to communicate , so as to express my opinion , and this is verified on two occasions , 48 - hours apart , by two doctors , then i would wish for my ventilation to be stopped and to manage my peaceful death			1
’ his wife of 30 years , @entity16 , 55 , said the achievements of professor @entity9 , make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish			2
after the film @entity77 thrust the academic ’s long life and success into the spotlight and won @entity3 , 33 , an @entity4 for his portrayal of @entity9 , miss @entity76 said people do not realise he is an ‘ exceptional ’ case			2
mr @entity10 is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives , most notably @entity89 , who died in december last year at the age of 51 after a year of refusing food			1
@entity16 , 55 , said the achievements of @entity29 ( pictured ) , make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish she lived with multiple sclerosis for almost two decades and was a vocal campaigner for the ‘ right to die ’			2
under current laws in @entity103 , it is an offence to encourage or assist anyone to commit suicide			0
however , campaigners last night raised concerns that the programme could ‘ normalise ’ suicide for the disabled and said the focus should be on improving quality of life			2
a spokesman for @entity115 said : ‘ we have deep concerns about this programme			0
it ’s vital that we do not normalise , in any way , suicide as an option for those who are disabled			0
' there are many people who are suffering from a whole raft of debilitating conditions who would be horrified at the suggestion that they should end their life			1
' what we need to be doing is focussing on how we ensure he has the very best quality of life and does n’t feel like he is becoming a financial or care burden on his family or on society as a whole			1
’ while mrs @entity76 does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children – @entity143 , 27 , and twins @entity14 and @entity144 – she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies			1
she told the @entity146 : ‘ @entity10 should have what he wants			1
either way i do n’t like the idea of losing him but i believe strongly that it ’s his life and he should have what he wants			2
you have all of these thoughts and emotions but at the end of the day it is down to him			2
‘ i ca n’t imagine what it will be like when we get to that but that ’s what i believe			0
it ’s his life and he should be able to choose			2
mr @entity10 is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives the documentary follows mr @entity10 ’s struggles from diagnosis in february 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in august 2014 , hoping it would allow him to live a further three years the family say the aim of the documentary , broadcast next wednesday , is to increase awareness of the disease ‘ the whole thing is quite surreal , having end of life conversations , but he ’s open enough to talk about it and while he wants to live if he ca n’t communicate that ’s the time he wants to end it			1
' you do n’t get any practice at this , you ’re just in it			0
there ’s no way out and no happy ending			0
we know we ’re going to lose him but as to how , if he ca n’t communicate that ’s the time			2
’ but it is not a decision that sits easily with the whole family and @entity14 reveals his concerns to the camera			1
he said : ‘ he says he wants to be switched off after he ca n’t communicate but i ca n’t actually imagine doing the tests and being like “ can you respond ? ” how do you judge what communication is ? ‘ for him to be completely himself and alive and for us to say okay , bye dad , you ca n’t communicate , and just turning off the machines			2
that to me is the worst way to go			0
’ the family say the aim of the documentary is to increase awareness of the disease			1
mrs @entity76 claims the public view it largely through the lens of its most famous sufferer , professor @entity9			0
however , as he was very young when he was diagnosed , it progresses much more slowly than usual			2
even allowing for this , professor @entity9 ’s longevity is remarkable			0
while mrs @entity76 does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children – @entity143 , 27 , and twins @entity14 and @entity144 – she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies the impact the disease has had on mr @entity10 's family is laid bare in the documentary , to be broadcast on wednesday mrs @entity76 said : ‘ people do n’t understand at all			1
people might see a tiny touch of it but they are not there to witness it , it ’s ghastly			0
it ’s a disease people just do n’t know about			2
they might know the name , they might know it through @entity9			0
' i ’m not medical but even i know he ’s the exception to the rule			0
people look at him and probably think people with motor neurone disease will live a very long time			1
his is an extremely exceptional case			0
’ the impact the disease has had on his family is laid bare in the documentary , to be broadcast on wednesday			1
it follows mr @entity10 ’s struggles from diagnosis in february 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in august 2014 , hoping it would allow him to live a further three years			1
in the intimate footage , which lifts the lid on what it is really like to live with a motor neurone disease sufferer , mrs @entity76 talks candidly about the strain it has put on their family and relationship			1
she said : ‘ it ’s incredibly hard			0
i do n’t want to be a widow and i do n’t want to lose him but how much more can you cope with ? ‘ i ’m really shocked			0
i thought , when he became ill we ’d almost become closer and closer but almost it ’s the opposite and i ca n’t believe that ’s happened			0
i ’m shocked that it draws people apart rather than together			0
’ speaking about the tracheostomy she added : ‘ i was thinking the other day , if it was my decision , not that it ever would be			0
' it would be so hard to say no knowing that he wants it but really and truly , i think myself and the kids are just exhausted with the whole thing and he ’s going to die , really , really sadly he ’s going to die			0
' be it tonight or tomorrow or in a month or two months or a year			0
it ’s just dragging out the inevitable			0
so if i had to say , i would say do n’t do it			0
