by @entity0 published : 21:05 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 21:05 est , 7 february 2014 around 700 doctors , nurses and health experts are calling on the government to ban smoking in cars carrying children ahead of a @entity11 vote on monday			1
in a letter to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , respiratory experts said secondhand smoke was a ‘ major cause of ill health in children ’			1
they said it was damaging to developing lungs , caused sudden infant death and resulted in thousands of hospital trips every year			1
@entity23 : hundreds of doctors have expressed support for a crackdown on smoking in cars signatories to the letter are being co-ordinated by dr @entity31 from @entity32 and chairman of the @entity35 ’s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease specialist advisory group			1
the letter said ‘ secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke is a major cause of ill health in children			2
‘ smoke inhalation damages the developing lung , and the @entity43 estimates that each year in the @entity45 it is responsible for 300,000 primary care contacts , 9,500 hospital admissions , at least 200 cases of bacterial meningitis and 40 sudden infant deaths			2
‘ most of this additional burden of disease falls on the more disadvantaged children in society , and all of it is avoidable			2
’ the @entity57 revealed last month that the ban could soon become law			1
deputy prime minister @entity60 says he does not support the policy			1
mr @entity60 , who smokes , said it was ‘ a stupid thing to do when a child is in the back of a car ’ but said he did not want to ‘ sub-contract ’ parenthood			2
danger : respiratory specialists believe that a ban will help prevent the spread of lung cancer but the @entity14 letter says those objecting to a change in law assumed there was a ‘ right to force children to breathe tobacco smoke ’			1
objectors ‘ seem to value this more highly than the children ’s right to breathe clean air ’ , it says			0
the letter comes as a minister announced yesterday there would be a free vote in the @entity11 on the issue on monday			0
transport minister @entity93 told mps he would vote in favour of the ban , having been forced to sit in the back of a car as a child while his father smoked			1
the vote comes as the @entity102 returns to the @entity11			0
the @entity103 was amended in the @entity104 last week after @entity105 tabled an amendment which would give the health secretary the power to make it illegal to smoke in a car carrying children			0
peers have now accepted a government - backed version of the amendment			0
@entity116 , chief executive of health charity @entity117 , said ‘ every day doctors see children with illnesses resulting from exposure to second - hand smoke , causing harm which is entirely preventable			0
‘ we understand why they feel so strongly and support their call to put an end to children ’s exposure to smoking in cars			1
’ @entity131 , director of @entity132 , said ‘ smoking in cars with children is inconsiderate but there is a line the state should n’t cross when it comes to dictating how people behave in private places			0
‘ very few adults smoke in a car with children these days			0
@entity114 should take encouragement from that and focus on education not legislation			0
‘ we urge mps to reject this unnecessary intrusion into people ’s private lives and trust parents to make the right decision for their children without the need for heavy - handed state intervention			0
