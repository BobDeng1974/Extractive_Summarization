by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 17 august 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 17 august 2013 an anonymous donation made to a fund 85 years ago is now worth £ 350m , but can not be touched due to a condition made by the donor at the time the £ 500,000 bequest - the same amount left by former nurse @entity6 which embarrassed the government this week - was to inspire the government to pay off the @entity11 's debt			1
but the donor specified in 1928 that the fund should be held in trust until the country raises enough money to pay off the whole debt , which currently stands at £ 1.2 trillion			1
donation : a £ 500,000 legacy left to the nation in 1928 to pay off the national debt is worth £ 350 million today the last @entity22 : miss @entity6 pictured shortly before her death and , right , as a child in 1931 , was well known amongst her neighbours leading a strict and pious lifestyle @entity27 , set up in the same year of the donation and now managed by @entity29 , has grown to become one of the largest charities in the @entity11 by net assets			1
@entity29 has been trying for four years to get permission to use the money to make charitable grants or to turn it over to the @entity36 , but any change would have to be approved by a court			2
a spokesman said : ' we 've been working ever since we became the trustee to change the original objects , which say the funds can be used only to pay off the entire national debt			1
' we are working with the @entity45 and the attorney general 's office to look at how best to take the fund forward			0
' home sweet home : @entity6 pictured outside her @entity51 council home in 1931 the former nurse left her fortune to the government to spend ' as they may think fit			2
' a spokesman for the attorney general 's office said : ' there has been correspondence between the @entity45 , the trustees and ourselves over the @entity27			2
' we are looking at a number of options for the future of the @entity27 , consistent with its object of extinguishing or reducing the national debt			1
' it would not be right to comment further whilst this process continues			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity45 said is it continuing dialogue with the trustee and the attorney general 's office regarding the charity			0
this week , the @entity73 and @entity74 handed the £ 520,000 left by @entity75 to the @entity36 after a furious row emerged over their acceptance of the money			1
modest : the ordinary semi-detached property which miss @entity6 lived in all her life , under the right to buy the scheme she was offered the chance to buy it for just £ 2,000 but refused @entity84 said the wording of her will made clear that her intention was for the money to ' benefit the nation ' rather than political parties			2
the legacy , disclosed along with other donations , sparked a bizarre row after a copy of the document emerged			0
conservative and @entity74 officials previously briefed that they had split the money because it was earmarked for " whichever party was in government "			0
but the text obtained by the @entity101 showed miss @entity6 - who died in september aged 90 - identified the beneficiary as " whichever government is in office at the date of my death "			0
as the backlash gathered pace , both coalition partners declared they would hand the funds to the @entity36 as a gesture of good faith .			0

donor specified that money would only be handed over when country raised enough to pay off national debt - but that stands today at £ 1.2 trillion
@entity27 has *battled* for four years to use money but would need a court order to pay it out
bequest of £ 500,000 was same amount left by former nurse which embarrassed the coalition
