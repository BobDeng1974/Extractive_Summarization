by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 took what their fans may view as a small measure of revenge over @entity7 last night			1

* @entity92 ratings by @entity0 at @entity9 @entity9 was almost full for this second round tie , the first meeting between the clubs since they fell out spectacularly over a @entity46 transfer			1
@entity7 paid compensation in the region of £ 20m to @entity2 after @entity46 ’s last - day winner away to champions @entity100 in 2006 - 07 effectively relegated the south @entity102 club			1
but there were irregularities over @entity46 ’s signing and the club were aggrieved that @entity7 were not punished more stringently			1
that money - and subsequent parachute payments for falling out of the @entity108 - was not put to good use and @entity2 are spending a fourth successive season in the third tier of @entity113 football			1
but tuesday night ’s result was sweet for them			0
manager @entity116 said : ‘ there ’s still a little a bit of injustice felt by our fans but hopefully this was about how we played , and the win tonight			2
’ both he and opposite number @entity22 praised @entity25 goalkeeper @entity67 , who made a series of superb saves to take the tie to penalties			2
‘ at the end of the day it is our fault , ’ said @entity22			0
‘ it was an @entity133 performance by their goalkeeper			0
whatever we shot at him he saved or blocked and if he saved , it fell to one of their boys			0
’ only three players from that 2006 - 07 season - @entity58 , @entity69 and @entity141 - remain at @entity9 and only @entity58 was included in tuesday night ’s squad			1
but the passage of time and personnel has not served to stem the flow of bad feeling			0
battle : @entity7 's @entity55 does his best to dispossess @entity2 midfielder @entity74 laces had barely been fastened before the first shouts of ‘ there ’s only one @entity46 ’ rang out from the home support			1
around 900 visiting fans travelled and from their corner of the sir @entity155 they responded with catty calls of ‘ same old @entity7 , always cheating ’			2
@entity22 handed a season debut to the boundlessly talented but seemingly endlessly troubled @entity57 , just two days before he is due to appear for a preliminary hearing at @entity160			0
the 21 - year - old has been charged with two counts of common assault			0
@entity57 , wearing the trademark black gloves he dons whatever the weather , from high summer to midwinter , played his part in their goal			0
his pass out wide was collected by @entity52 and whipped into the box to @entity30 , who headed into the bottom corner			2
it was a debut goal for the @entity177 striker signed from @entity178 for £ 3.5m			0
@entity2 were fortunate to equalise 12 minutes into the second half through a @entity33 own goal			1
the @entity7 captain was in the wrong place at the wrong time when @entity71 ’s cross was missed by @entity79 and deflected off @entity33 past @entity19			1
challenge : @entity186 attempts to shrug off the attentions of @entity7 centre back @entity33 on the touchline : @entity7 manager @entity22 and @entity2 boss @entity116 share words			1

@entity108 side @entity7 knocked out of @entity26 on penalties by @entity193 @entity2
hammers took lead through new boy @entity30 shortly before half - time
@entity2 equalised after @entity33 scored a second - half own goal
home fans at @entity9 taunted opposition with @entity46 masks
first time the two sides had met since the ' @entity206 ' back in 2007
