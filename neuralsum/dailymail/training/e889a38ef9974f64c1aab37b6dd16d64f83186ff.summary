@entity1 aside , it will be difficult for most football people not to be excited by sunday 's @entity4 debut for @entity5 against @entity6			1
the procession of genuine world - class talent to @entity9 has seemed like one - way traffic in recent years while the @entity11 sat around waiting for the scraps left over from @entity13 and @entity14			2
latterly , even @entity15 and @entity16 have been the preferred destination over @entity18			2
so even players of international renown and some experience are infected by the vibrancy that the @entity23 has brought to the @entity11 and to @entity4 , @entity24 included			1
‘ it ’s exciting — and also for the @entity11			2
he could have gone to a number of other clubs but it ’s great we ’ve got him			2
’ and given the desperate start the club have made — two points from three games and elimination from the @entity47 — the arrival of @entity5 , along with @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , has provided a renewed sense of optimism at the club			1
‘ obviously last season , we all know we were not good enough , ’ says @entity24			2
‘ but the time is now right to get these top players to get us back to where we belong , back to winning titles again			2
it ’s exciting times , it ’s interesting times for @entity4			1
we ’ve not got off to the best of starts but we are confident			2
it ’s a great signing			2
it ’s a great statement of intent			2
and i am looking forward to working with him			2
hopefully we can form a great partnership			2
’ as captain , @entity24 will be responsible for ensuring the transition from @entity16 to @entity71 is smooth			2
‘ you have to make sure the new players are made to feel welcome , ’ said @entity24			2
@entity50 was signed by @entity4 for £ 60million from @entity75 giants @entity14 @entity76 defender @entity51 will finally make his @entity78 debut two weeks after signing for the club @entity49 was another of the stars to arrive at @entity4 over the summer but in terms of how the team are going to play , even @entity24 has not quite figured that out yet			1
‘ @entity5 is a world - class player and it ’s down to the manager how he chooses to play			1
he [ @entity31 ] has myself , @entity5 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , so it ’s a great selection of players for him to pick from			1
’ yet amid the sense of euphoria that big - name signings always create , there are ripples of discontent			2
@entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have all spoken of their surprise that @entity4 sold @entity30 , a youth - team graduate , who understands the club , fans and the area , and recruited a @entity23 on loan , a player who has never spent more than two years at a club since he left @entity109 in 2009			1
to make way for the new arrivals , another youth - team graduate , @entity110 , has also been moved on loan to @entity113 and over the summer £ 160million has been spent			1
it might have transformed some people ’s view of @entity4 ’s executive vice-chairman @entity117 , with @entity118 saying he had done his job ‘ brilliantly ’ after questioning whether @entity4 were capable of finalising the biggest deals			1
former @entity4 striker @entity30 made his debut for @entity122 on saturday @entity110 ( right ) made his @entity113 debut on saturday against @entity124 having been let go by @entity4 but for @entity29 , the man who made his name primarily by promoting young players and not through lavish spending , it looks an unlikely change of direction			1
nurturing the youth was his stock in trade at @entity133 in the @entity134 , where he established his reputation by winning the @entity136 in 1995			0
and even at the richest clubs such as @entity13 and @entity138 he seemed to concern himself more with young players from the academies than with major signings			0
the manager bristles when the point is put to him , his explanation being that he still believes in youth but that he has sought to disrupt the atmosphere of the dressing room to create a new dynamic			1
‘ you have seen @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 playing			0
when you see my line - ups there are several young players who have played already			0
so i do n’t think i have changed my philosophy , only that we have to change the selection to give a new rhythm in the dressing room , ’ he says			0
‘ when you are there for more than two or three years as a substitute , do you think this is a good thing for the players ? no. @entity150 started @entity4 's first game of the season against @entity167 @entity149 ( right ) has been a regular for @entity4 since @entity31 took over @entity151 is another young player that @entity31 has given a first - team chance to ‘ my philosophy is that you have to sell those players or send them on loan			1
better for them and also better for the atmosphere in the dressing room			0
so we let go 14 players and we bought six players , so there are eight vacancies for young players			0
but it depends on the level of the young players at @entity4			1
i can not change that			0
but i have already played with a lot of youngsters so i do n’t understand your question			0
’ he might not put it this way but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that @entity29 feels he has cleared out some dead wood to allow new flowers to blossom			0
but there are more seasoned @entity29 watchers , those who have worked closely with him in the past , who have been surprised by the signals the summer transfer window has sent out			1
@entity195 was one of @entity29 ’s key players at @entity197 , the club where @entity29 restored his reputation by winning the @entity200 league in 2009 after failing with the @entity202 national team in 2002 and his indifferent second spell at @entity13 in 2003			0
@entity195 became close to @entity29 , is still in touch with him and now works as a pundit for @entity206 in @entity202			0
‘ i ’m really surprised about the players he has bought , the money he has spent , the positions they are in , ’ says @entity195			1
‘ maybe because of the good results in pre-season he thought @entity4 were better than they are			1
for me , from the outside , it looks like he ’s not the only one deciding who is coming in			0
@entity195 ( left , who worked with @entity31 ) shoots for goal during his time at @entity197 @entity221 played for @entity14 against rivals @entity222 on saturday after leaving @entity4 ‘ i understand @entity50 because @entity29 is looking at a type and he needs a player like @entity225 , who can do something on his own , carry the ball 50 metres passing people			1
he could n’t get @entity225 , so i guess @entity88 was second best			0
but renting @entity5 for that kind of money when you have @entity232 , @entity24 and you had @entity221 and @entity30 , is a big surprise			1
’ significantly , @entity29 suggests the spending is not yet over			0
‘ we have more balance in the squad but not enough balance , ’ says the @entity4 manager			1
when pressed on areas which remain out of equilibrium , he said : ‘ obviously the defending part			0
’ perhaps at @entity36 there will be a balance			1
sources close to @entity4 speak of how he has spoken with enthusiasm about @entity247 and @entity248 , players with whom domestic observers have long since become impatient			1
and his persistence with @entity149 , another who is said to be soaking up @entity29 ’s instructions , the insistence that @entity258 can be his fourth striker , the use of @entity150 on the opening day of the season are actions more in line with the @entity29 of old			0
‘ that ’s his trademark , ’ said @entity195			0
‘ he likes to prove you wrong			1
if you write @entity247 is the worst player , he likes to show you : “ hey , i can make smalling a good player ”			1
@entity31 is said to be enthusiastic about the potential of @entity247 and @entity248 ( right ) @entity266 ( left , a @entity197 player @entity29 improved ) celebrates with @entity267 ‘ the best example was @entity266 at @entity197			1
he was n’t that good passing or in his first touch			0
and after four months with the training of @entity29 , he became brilliant			0
that was the biggest change i ’ve seen , from a player who could n’t pass to one who was very good			0
‘ my only worry that @entity29 would not be a success is because @entity283 players are not tactical , clever players			0
at the moment the back - line do n’t push up , so the space between midfield and the defence is too big so everyone can just play in between there			2
it ’s just too easy			0
it was unbelievable in that first game against @entity167 and i doubt they understand what he wants			0
’ of course , if he can transform @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and even older players such as @entity248 and @entity247 into significant @entity4 defenders , the £ 160m spent will seem unimportant given the money he has saved the club			1
but if he ca n’t , he may just find himself knocking on @entity117 ’s door again in january asking for more			0
@entity31 has a stunning squad to choose from after a summer of spending at @entity36 but the new @entity4 boss has his work cut out choosing a starting @entity299 and keeping those he leaves on the bench happy			1
3 - 4 - 1 - 2 if @entity302 wants to squeeze the majority of his signings , this is the way to go			0
but it has blind in an unfamiliar central role and is ridiculously open in central midfield			0
would surely need a @entity310 type in there to shore things up			0
4 - 3 - 3 looks a little more balanced but asking @entity232 and @entity24 to run wide for @entity5 might not go down terribly well			1
@entity24 will do the job but @entity87 has n’t played there since his early days at @entity122			1
still no room for @entity317			0
4 - 4 - 2 a classic @entity319 formation — wingers ( though you might want @entity322 on the right to really get outside players ) and two central midfielders who can tackle and pass			0
but @entity89 , @entity87 and @entity326 — £ 75m of talent — are sat on the bench .			1
