@entity21 , two , was diagnosed with leukaemia after she developed a cold which failed to clear up however , three days later , @entity13 still showed no improvement - and deteriorated to a point where she was not eating or drinking and was sleeping 23 hours a day – so she was taken back to hospital			1
doctors carried out chest x-rays and told the family @entity13 had pneumonia			1
but , after getting the results of blood tests , on october 3 doctors gave @entity13 a blood transfusion and rushed her to @entity36			1
mrs @entity21 , 40 , said : ‘ at this point , we had no idea what was wrong - at worst i thought it would be asthma or diabetes			1
‘ they put us on a ward where there were all these children with no hair and i thought it was just while they were waiting to put us on a different ward			0
‘ then a @entity51 nurse came and introduced herself to us but i could not understand why we needed a @entity51 nurse			1
’ @entity13 ( pictured with her mother , @entity11 ) was initially diagnosed with a chest infection and given antibiotics but her parents took her back for further tests after her condition deteriorated and she stopped eating @entity13 was transferred from @entity17 to @entity36 where her parents say they were taken to a cancer ward before being told she had leukaemia a consultant arrived shortly after and asked @entity12 and mrs @entity21 to come for a private chat in his office			1
they were told @entity13 has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , a cancer of the white blood cells			1
mrs @entity21 said : ‘ it was just awful			2
it was even more upsetting than when my father died - and that 's saying something			0
‘ but i was so overwhelmed by the shock it felt like i had been switched off - i went completely numb and nothing was registering			0
‘ the doctor was going on - and - on and i could n't hear a single word he was saying			0
@entity13 ( pictured with her parents , @entity11 and @entity12 , and her brother , @entity79 ) is now having intensive treatment for her cancer , including chemotherapy and blood transfusions ‘ i was just looking into this forest landscape painting that was hung on the wall			1
‘ the doctor could have been repeating “ i 'm a monkey , i 'm a monkey ” and i would n't have noticed			0
’ @entity13 spent a month in hospital after her diagnosis and had intensive chemotherapy and steroid treatment as well as five blood transfusions			1
after returning home briefly , she went back for more chemotherapy and is now going back to hospital twice a week			1

but everybody has got behind us and without the support we have had , we would have cracked long ago			0
’ @entity13 is now undergoing intensive treatment which will continue for at least two years and she has already lost her curly hair following chemotherapy			2

mother - of - five mrs @entity21 said : ' we just take each day at a time and try not to look too far ahead ' ‘ when the specialist mentioned the word “ leukaemia ” , my first terrified thought was that @entity13 was going to die			1
‘ when i was at school , a girl i knew got leukaemia and she died and i instantly thought of that and it frightened me			0
‘ but luckily , medical advances have been made since then and we have to take each day at a time and hope that @entity13 's leukaemia will be cured			1
’ mr and mrs @entity21 , who live in @entity134 , @entity135 , revealed that they could n't have coped without the support of friends , family and the community who have rallied around and raised funds to help them through the financial difficulties that their situation has suddenly landed them with			2

‘ the @entity164 branch in @entity165 have been fundraising and lots of other people have been so generous by giving us food and money to help us through a difficult time			0
‘ we can not claim any financial support as you have to wait for three months after diagnosis			0
but once we can claim , i am planning to raise to raise money for the @entity176 house where we stayed and for @entity177 , the children 's cancer charity			0
’ a spokesman for @entity181 said : ' we are sorry to hear that the family have concerns about their transfer to @entity36			2
