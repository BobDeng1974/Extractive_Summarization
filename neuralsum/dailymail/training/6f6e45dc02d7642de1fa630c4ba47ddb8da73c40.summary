by @entity0 the first word their child speaks is a moment all parents remember			1
but for @entity6 , it was a particularly emotional - because it meant her son had survived gruelling surgery			1
four - year - old @entity9 woke up from the operation and uttered his word ever word - " mummy ”			1
when he came round from the operation , his first word was ' mummy ' @entity9 , who has @entity22 , suffered heart failure soon after birth and needed a risky operation - but was then diagnosed with a rare lung condition and spent six months in intensive care			1
he was expected to be on a ventilator long - term for life			1
but the youngster instead came off the machine , although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe			0
this is a surgical procedure to create an opening in the neck at the front of the windpipe ( trachea ) - but it made it virtually impossible for @entity9 to to speak			1
although his airway had collapsed , @entity9 ’s surgeon suggested out he could carry out a full reconstruction			1
this involved grafting a piece of cartilage from @entity9 ’s rib onto his airway to strengthen it			1
ms @entity6 and her partner @entity48 , of @entity49 , @entity50 , agonised about whether he should have the risky surgery			1
struggle : before the surgery , it was expected that @entity9 would be on a ventilator for life			1
but the youngster instead came off the machine , although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe			0
following surgery , he no longer needs this either ms @entity6 , a full - time mother , said : ' it was such a hard decision to make			2
@entity9 was happy with his tracheostomy			1
he did n't seem to mind it at all			2
' all the other operations he 's had have been life - or - death , this one had to be our choice			0
' then we had to take into consideration the risks - the fact that the operation was taking place just milimetres away from his vocal chords , so we could lose what chance we had of hearing him speak			2
' also the operation could cause damage and affected his chance of eating properly			0
' but we really wanted him to be free of the tubes and give him the chance to speak properly , to be able to communicate with his friends and play with them			1
' before , he was n't able to get mucky like any other little boy because the tubes had to be kept clean			2
' the pair eventually decided to go ahead and he underwent the operation at @entity90 last month			0
thankfully , the surgery was successful			2
ms @entity6 , 46 , said : ' it ’s amazing			0
when they told us he was now breathing , we just did n’t know what to say			2
' happy : lyall with his parents , @entity6 and @entity48			0
ms @entity6 said : ' hearing his first word was such an emotional moment			2
it was the perfect first word for him to say - and hearing it was amazing ' throughout his short life , @entity9 has defied expert opinion as he has battled various serious health conditions			1
after the operation he had to be sedated in intensive care for several days to allow the graft to heal			2
she added : ' @entity9 had the operation on march 13 and was sedated for three days to stop him from pulling on the tubes and allow the wound to heal			1
then he got a chest infection and they had to keep him sedated for up to a week in total			0
' waiting three or four days for him to wake up was long enough , but it was hell waiting for a week to see how he was and if we 'd made the right decision			0
when surgeons were eventually were able to bring him round , he began breathing for himself			1
' the first thing he said when he woke up was " mummy " , really clearly , said ms @entity48			0
' there were a lot of tears			0
enjoyment : now @entity9 can form many words and sounds he could n't before , is giggling and shouting , and enjoying the freedom he has never had ' it was such an emotional moment			1
it was the perfect first word for him to say really , hearing it was just amazing			2
' while in hospital , medical staff from throughout his life saw him and many became very emotional by his progress - which his mothers said was very touching			2
one told us : ' it 's more than was ever imaginable , ' said ms @entity6			0
' it took about three weeks for him to get back to himself - now he 's running around , shouting , back to his boisterous self			0
' now @entity9 can form many words and sounds he could n’t before , is giggling and shouting , and enjoying the freedom he has never had			1
ms @entity6 said : ' he can be more free			0
he can be upstairs playing with his friends or brothers while we are downstairs			0
we ’ve never been able to do that before - and that ’s massive			0
' he started school full - time in september so we definitely made the right decision and did it at the right time			0
' his family said they were ' indebted ' to surgeons for all they have done for @entity9 - and have now set up a fundraising drive to help other children like him			1
they want to buy resources for the wards which use @entity161 , a simple sign language which @entity9 uses , so they can better communicate with young patients			1
and they hope to enable frontline staff to learn a few basic signs which could make hospital less stressful for youngsters			0
' we want to make a difference for kids like him who are coming through - it would be great , ' said ms @entity48			0
@entity9 will take part in the @entity175 on may 11 , while his fifth birthday will be celebrated by a fundraising party on june 6 with an appearance from signing group singing hands			1
