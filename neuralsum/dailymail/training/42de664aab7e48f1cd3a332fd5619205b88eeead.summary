@entity0 once again got the better of old foe @entity1 in a pulsating renewal of the @entity4 at @entity5			1
with the score three - two in favour of @entity9 ' brilliant hurdler heading into their latest battle , @entity0 was the 5 - 6 favourite to get the job done again			1
@entity1 was the first of the big two to commit for home in the hands of @entity17 , but @entity18 tracked him through aboard @entity0 and there was little to choose between the pair jumping the final flight			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 produced a storming finish to the @entity4 at @entity5 11211/131/1111/1131/11111/1114 - 211 both horses fought tooth and nail to the line , but it was @entity0 who brought the house down with another determined success			1
@entity1 was one of three runners in the field for leading owner @entity33 and his two other participants , @entity35 and @entity36 , did their best to give the @entity39 - trained @entity38 hero a tow into the race			1
@entity1 hit the front after the home turn , but @entity0 , who beat his major rival in this race 12 months ago , was right in his slipstream			1
when it turned into a scrap after the last hurdle , @entity9 ' inmate once again dug deep into his reserves to seize the day			0
there was little between @entity0 and @entity1 as they jumped the last in the @entity4 the pair battled it out all the way to the line as the crowd roared them home from the last hurdle it was @entity0 's fourth victory in this race and his ninth from as many starts at his beloved @entity5			1
the winner 's stable companion , @entity66 , was not far behind the big two in third			2
@entity18 said : ' he 's an incredible little horse , but it takes two horses to make a race and , in fairness to @entity1 , he showed up today and it was an honest race			1
' plinth and @entity36 built the pace all the way down the back ( straight ) and it turned into a test of stamina more so than a sprint			0
' he 's a pleasure to ride			2
to have him at the peak of his powers for so many years is an incredible feat. ' you 'll never take 21 @entity89 away from him and counting			0
' @entity9 said : ' i think he 's the best anyone has ever trained over jumps			2
i 'll never have another horse like him			0
' @entity9 was keen to praise @entity0 's fighting qualities which yielded a half - length success			1
' there is a fantastic atmosphere here and it was a fantastic race just to watch , ' said the @entity100 handler			0
@entity18 managed to get @entity0 to the post just ahead of @entity17 on @entity1 ' it was a superbly run race			1
@entity33 's horses had the advantage , tactically			2
i told @entity18 to ride him as you find him and do n't try and beat @entity1			1
' coming to the final flight , @entity0 always gets a good jump but @entity1 got a fantastic one as well			1
' when he got over the last he put his ears back and no horse i 've ever seen can battle like him			0
' when he got his head in front he kept it there and he 's just a professional			2
' @entity18 said he jumped a shadow at the first and landed on it			1
he had a bit of gorse stuck in his girth coming back in which must have been uncomfortable for him			0
' he did n't look happy going away on the bend from the stands and it took him until about the mile to warm up			0
@entity18 was all smiles as he was led in after @entity0 's thrilling triumph in the @entity4 the crowd lapped up the race and gave @entity0 a warm welcome back the @entity4 success was the 21st @entity131 victory for @entity0 ' we expected @entity1 to be better but we knew we were better as well			1
there is not much between them			0
' we 're always trying to find the next one coming along but i do n't think i have anything like him			0
' @entity137 is seven from seven but he has a long way to go			0
hopefully we find another one but he 's unique			2
' last year people were asking me would he be retired but i said , ' no , why ? '			0
' he had two less - than - good runs but any horse is allowed that			0
i thought if the ability was still there there was no question and he was showing at home that the zest for racing was still there			0
' we probably did n't do enough with him in the second half of last season			0
' we were training him like he was when he was still keen but he 's not like that now			2
' i 'm enjoying his wins more now as there is not the pressure there used to be			0
' although stablemate @entity137 is the ante - post @entity38 favourite for the @entity162 showpiece in march , @entity9 said : ' to me , he 's our top @entity38 horse - he has the ratings			2
' he ( @entity137 ) looks the one coming up , but he 's ( @entity0 ) doing it			1
' @entity9 said @entity0 is likely to next compete in the @entity166 back at @entity5 on january 25 .			1
