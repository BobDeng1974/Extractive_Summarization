quarter of @entity2 's business comes from junk mail scam mail costs victims £ 2.4bn a year by @entity7 reporter last updated at 3:49 pm on 5th july 2011 cost : disposing junk mail is costing @entity10 councils more than £ 50m per year taxpayers ' are forking out more than £ 50 million a year - just to get rid of junk mail that is dumped on their doorsteps			1
last year the county of @entity15 alone paid £ 700,000 to send 4,000 tonnes of unwanted leaflets , pamphlets , menus and glossy adverts to landfill - enough to fill 500 dustcarts			2
if it was recycled it would still cost a staggering £ 500,000 to process			0
the claim comes as , tonight , the @entity24 's @entity23 reveals that @entity2 ' financially relies ' on the distribution of junk mail - which is now said to be vital to the service 's future			1
@entity30 , @entity31 vice chairman , said : ' if you extrapolate [ the @entity15 figure ] across @entity10 it 's more than £ 50 million a year			2
' we 've got to cut down the stuff going into the waste streams , there 's a lot of unwanted packaging			0
' if people stop producing this stuff then we could make significant savings to their council tax , he told @entity46 's today programme			0
' tonight 's @entity23 will look at the role @entity2 plays in getting junk and scam mail , of which it delivered 1.7 billion pieces last year , to residents ' front doors			1
it focuses on its links to @entity55 , which handles vast amount of mail for legitimate international business , but is also alleged to be used by scam mail fraudsters			1
@entity2 owns 33 per cent of the firm , in partnership with the @entity63 postal service @entity64 , that sends large amount of scam mail into @entity67			1
and once that mail , which bears the official @entity2 postmark and is not evidently from abroad , has entered the @entity67 postal system the service has a legal obligation to deliver it			2
profitable : @entity2 is said to earn a quarter of its money through distributing junk mail fraud investigators said the @entity2 logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy , giving credence to the scammers ' claims			1
@entity83 , director of the @entity84 , said : ' we 're trying to make @entity55 and @entity2 more aware of the human tragedy that this type of fraudulent mail impacts on victims			1
' i think they need to understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people			0
' @entity96 , whose late mother @entity97 was scammed out of £ 50,000 , said the official stamp of approval ' proved the scams were real ' to her , and that it was now up to the @entity2 to protect the vulnerable			2
she said : ' my mother used to say , it is n't a scam , it 's genuine			2
this is the @entity105 's mail			0
' @entity2 are delivering , in effect , coach loads of criminals to the houses of elderly and vulnerable people			0
they are the link between the victim and the scammer			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 said it was working closely with police to stop scam mail from entering the system			1
he said : ' we very much understand the upset and disquiet that scam mail can cause households across the country , including vulnerable people			1
' we do not want our postmen or women handling or delivering mail that causes harm			0
we have made significant progress in our efforts to root out scam mail as we intensify our drive against it			1
' @entity55 said it too was working closely with police and other agencies to prevent scam mail slipping through , and that since january it had removed six million items out of the system			1
of the ' local look ' postmarks , it said in a statement : ' local look is a recognised international marketing activity to prepare mail with a foreign postal indicia			0
not wanted here : junk mail has become so undesirable that many homes are putting up signs asking for it not to be delivered ' this happens across the world and not just in the @entity67			2
the vast majority of companies using such a service are legitimate businesses that are looking to reduce costs and improve response rates			0
' but @entity157 , who authored a report for the government on @entity2 's future , said legitimate junk mail was central to the financial viability of @entity2			1
he found that income from legitimate advertising mail accounted for nearly a quarter of @entity2 's letters business - £ 1.3bn out of a total of £ 5.4bn			1
making a mint : @entity2 has to , by law , deliver any items which enter into the postal system he added : ' the supreme irony is that without advertising mail , you would not have a universal postal service			2
' the @entity176 said sales due to junk mail totted up to £ 16bn a year and that half of the @entity67 population had bought goods as a result of a piece of direct mail last year			1
and @entity185 , its head of postal and environmental affairs , said : ' i do think we do need to make a differentiation between advertising mail and junk mail			2
' for us it 's very simple , junk mail is irrelevant and poorly targeted			1
that is waste and unnecessary			0
however , legitimate advertising mail is a different matter			0
it 's whether it 's relevant to those people			0
' we have a very strict code of practice in terms of targeting and supression			0
' and in fact the industry has made huge steps in the use of that			0
inevitably there is some instances where that is not going to be accurate			0
' but we are on the verge of signing a voluntary agreement with @entity218 that will give us some very hard measurable targets to achieve our targets			0
' victims : those who fall prey to scam mail pay out £ 2.4bn every year			1

quarter of @entity2 's business comes from junk mail
scam mail costs victims £ 2.4bn a year
