the @entity11 preceded a trio of wartime conferences attended by the leaders of @entity10 , @entity8 and the @entity25			1
known as the @entity27 , the first of these was the @entity28 in november 1943 in which @entity29 and @entity7 travelled to @entity30 to meet with @entity31			1
the central aim of the @entity28 was to plan the final strategy for the war against @entity35 and its allies , and the chief discussion was centered on the opening of a second front in @entity40			1
the @entity41 was held in february 1945 at the @entity42 in the @entity43			1
its main purpose was to discuss @entity40 's post-war re-organisation			1
as the meeting finished , a final plan for the occupation of @entity35 was agreed upon and @entity29 obtained @entity31 's word that the @entity25 would participate in the new @entity51			2
the final meeting of the @entity27 was the @entity53 in summer of 1945			2
the meeting was also attended by @entity54 as the @entity8 was awaiting the outcome of the general election			2
@entity57 attended as the new @entity10 president following @entity29 's death in april			2
one of the main objectives was to decide how to administer punishment to the defeated @entity35			2
the other principal goals of the conference were to begin designing the postwar world and negotiating treaties			2
only three other photographs jointly signed by the two wartime leaders are known			1
it was at the @entity11 that the @entity69 took the crucial and far reaching decision to demand unconditional surrender from @entity35 and the @entity72			0
militarily , it also resolved the long running and sometimes bitter dispute between the @entity77 commanders over strategy			0
while @entity29 and @entity7 enjoyed a good personal relationship there was little love lost between some of the other participants at the conference			0
the @entity10 military leaders , in particular , felt that the @entity8 had been dragging their heels over the invasion of mainland @entity40 in favour of an invasion through @entity90 and on into @entity91			1
the @entity11 resolved this dispute in @entity8 ’s favour			0
the successful invasion of @entity90 took place in july and august 1943 with the invasion of @entity97 following in june 1944			0
notably absent from the conference was @entity25 dictator @entity31 , who stayed in @entity99 due to the raging battle of @entity101 , which by that point the communists had nearly won			0
and so , as @entity107 soldiers finally began to roll back the @entity108 on the @entity109 , the conference marked the turning point for the @entity69 in @entity40			0
@entity29 presented the results of the conference to the @entity10 people in a radio address on february 12 , 1943			0
