@entity0 has urged @entity1 to rid themselves of @entity3 ’s gallant loser tag by grasping their @entity5 second chance on tuesday night			1
the @entity6 head into their second leg in @entity8 trailing 3 - 1 following an abject display at the @entity10			1
in each of the past four seasons , @entity1 have narrowly crashed out at the last 16 stage			1
@entity1 were in fine form to beat @entity14 on saturday and will need to carry that momentum forward the @entity6 will need to overturn a two - goal deficit against a team who rarely concede last season they secured a credible 1 - 1 draw in @entity21 after losing the first leg ; in 2013 @entity1 won 2 - 0 in the @entity23 only to crash out 3 - 2 on aggregate after a crushing first leg loss			1
three years ago , having lost 4 - 0 to @entity27 in the first leg , @entity0 ’s side staged a brilliant comeback only to fall short in a 3 - 0 second leg win			1
and in 2011 , @entity1 again missed out by a solitary goal , crashing out 4 - 3 on aggregate to @entity32 despite winning the first leg 2 - 1 at the @entity10			1
and now @entity1 must perform yet another @entity34 comeback in @entity8 with @entity0 desperate for his side to finish the job this time			1
@entity0 says his team have an opportunity to right the wrongs of last month 's defeat to @entity8 @entity41 and @entity42 cut a dejected figure while @entity1 were being beaten at home by @entity8 ‘ that ’s not what you want ( to be called gallant losers ) , you want to qualify , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we have got it wrong in the first game			2
what you want in life is the chance to put it right			2
we have the opportunity to put it right and after , no matter what , we will be ready to give everything to do it			2
‘ we are in a position where @entity8 are favourites			2
we can go there and create something special			2
i believe we will have the desire to do it			0
‘ honestly , i ’d prefer to be 3 - 0 up ( but ) we have no choice			1
we have to put it right			0
‘ sometimes in life , you make a big mistake and there ’s no comeback , no way you get the chance to put it right again			2
‘ in football , you can do it so let ’s just give everything			0
is all the pressure on @entity8 ? they can lose it			1
they ’ve already won it but they can still lose it			0
’ should the @entity6 need a further motivation then they only have to glance at @entity8 striker @entity83 ’s suggestions that his side wanted it more than the @entity86 club during the first leg			1
@entity42 has bounced back from a poor performance to score three times in four games since @entity8 the @entity1 striker hit a stunning goal to put the @entity6 ahead at home to @entity14 on saturday ‘ we have enough experience to know that what happens on tuesday night does not depend on statement of people , but just depends on our performance on the night , ’ said the @entity1 boss			1
‘ i do n’t believe that ( @entity8 wanted it more than @entity1 )			1
i think we wanted too much to make a difference in the first game and forgot our basics			0
’ meanwhile , @entity42 is determined to right the wrongs of his wasteful performance in the first leg last month			2
the @entity107 was heavily criticised by his own supporters for missing gilt - edged chances in the clash			2
but the striker has responded well , scoring three in as many starts since the defeat to @entity8 — including a brilliant strike in the win over @entity14 that fired @entity1 to within a point of second - placed @entity117			1
‘ i try to bounce back as quickly as i can and it ’s true the boss gave me a chance to do it against @entity123 ( after the @entity8 defeat ) , ’ said the @entity119 international			1
@entity1 crashed out of the @entity5 last season despite a good display against @entity21 in 2012 the @entity6 came close to overturning a 4 - 0 deficit against @entity27 , but fell just short ‘ i try to do it straight away			1
if you let the doubts enter your head it ’s even more difficult to cope			0
‘ there are always tough moments like that because we do a hard job			0
you have to question yourself every week and bounce back			0
‘ i try to show my answer on the pitch with my mentality			0
football is a sport where you need to have a strong mentality because you have to face some difficulties			0
‘ even when you play well and score a lot of goals , if you miss some everything is forgotten			0
you have to have a conscience about it and be aware			0
‘ do n’t believe the people who talk too much about football			0
i know when i play well or not			0
i know how to bounce back			0
i say that football is an everlasting new beginning			0
