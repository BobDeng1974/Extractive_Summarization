' and i never saw the fascination			1
so they liked sex how they liked it			1
who cares ? ' he writes in the book 's preface : ' although i 'm not a shy man i have always been reticent to reveal details about what i have done , mainly to respect the privacy of those whose lives have intersected with mine '			1
he explained his change of heart to the @entity40 : ' i finally said yes because i ’m not getting any younger and all of my famous tricks are dead by now			1

newly discharged from the @entity1 after @entity93 he got a job at a gas station near @entity96 , reports the @entity40			1
the book is as explicit as it is bawdy			1
the author describes pumping gas one day when actor @entity101 drove up and propositioned him with a $ 20 bill			2
it was to be the start of an era of ' amazing , intoxicating days , wildly erotic and carefree ' , he writes in the book			2
in its first chapter , mr @entity46 writes that the well - spoken mrs @entity110 star drove him to a large house on that blazingly hot afternoon			2
the actor and his friend , @entity113 , invited him to use the swimming pool : ' it 's hot @entity116			2
hop in for a swim , i 'll join you in a minute ... no need for a suit			2
there 's no one else here			2
' mr @entity46 claims he romped with the erstwhile @entity50 , pictured left in 1949 , and says he also had threesomes with @entity50 and @entity8 , pictured , right , in 1942 he describes then having ' really hot sex ' with the married men , who were in their 50s			2
' neither of them exhibited even a hint of effeminate behaviour			2
they were both in remarkably good shape , too , especially when you consider their ages ' , he recalls			2
the men saw each other off and on over the years : ' we always had a lot of fun together ' , writes mr @entity46			2
the author - who admits he did not have a sheltered childhood - had a first wife , @entity143 , who gave birth to their daughter @entity145 in february of 1947			2
he says life at home with his wife ' was pretty dull '			2
' @entity19 and one of his gay lovers drove in one night ... in due course , he and i would get to know one another pretty well ' life at the @entity157 gas station on @entity158 - which had turned into a trendy hang - out - was far more exciting			1
' @entity19 and one of his gay lovers drove in one night in a brand - new 1947 @entity160 , of which he was very proud ' , he writes in the book 's first chapter			1
' he filled up and we chatted ; every second of third day after that he came back and had me pump five dollars worth of gas into his car			0
he was living in @entity4 at the time and , in due course , he and i would get to know one another pretty well			0
' a request from a ' middle - aged queen ' to meet one of mr @entity46 ' 20 - year - old blond friends is what tipped him away from being a casual sexual partner of mr @entity101 's and towards the world of turning tricks			1
according to mr @entity46 , he stumbled into a business that he ran from his base at the gas station , servicing clients himself as well as setting them up with his handsome @entity1 friends			1

in his preface , the author writes : ' whatever folks wanted , i had it			0
i could make all their fantasies come true			0
no matter how outrageous or off - beat people 's tastes , i was the one who knew how to get them exactly what they were after			0
straight , gay , or bi ; male or female ; young or old - i had something for everyone			0
' ' frankly , ' he writes , ' i knew @entity4 like no one else knew it			0

in his book , mr @entity46 writes that , in addition to his gay clients , he also gained a following among heterosexual actors like @entity234 , who used him as a matchmaking service			0
the x-rated revelations come after years of silence on the part of mr @entity46 , who claims , reports the @entity40 , that as he never accepted cash for his services , was ' not a pimp '			0
unsurprisingly , though not yet out , the book has met with mixed reception - with some doubting its veracity			0

' ' full service : my adventures in @entity4 and the @entity295 ' opens the doors of the closeted , x-rated under world of old @entity4 over three decades the shocking tell - all is likely to meet with some rather less supportive audiences - particularly the relatives and fans of some of those exposed			0
the book has been libel - checked and @entity305 , an entertainment lawyer at @entity306 , told the newspaper that while some readers ' might be in tears ... there ’s nothing they can do about it			0
' the publishers , however , stand by the chronicle of the bygone era , with @entity317 / @entity316 's @entity315 telling the newspaper that he did not feel mr @entity46 was being ' meanspirited ' , and did not ' get the sense that this guy is trying to exploit these experiences			0
' mr @entity46 , who told the @entity40 that he prefers the sexual company of women , continued his eyebrow - raising and largely hidden sideline until the onset of @entity327 in the 1980s			0

' it was obvious that my days of arranging tricks for others were over			0
it was too unsafe a game to play anymore			0
