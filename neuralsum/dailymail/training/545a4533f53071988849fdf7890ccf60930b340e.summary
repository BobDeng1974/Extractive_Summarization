@entity0 believe that @entity1 will remain with the club as the @entity4 era dawns at @entity5			1
one of the graduates of the class of 1992 , @entity1 is contracted with the club and works alongside @entity9 with the under - 21 team and manages the under - 19 side in the @entity12			0
it is believed that he is set to continue in that position next season			0
@entity16 understands that @entity1 has made no indication to the club that he would be unwilling to continue in his role with a highly - placed source saying : ‘ @entity7 are very important to @entity0			1
part of the set - up : @entity1 assisted @entity23 at the end of last season when the @entity26 was interim manager @entity28 : the former midfielder played over 350 times for @entity0 during an 11 year career @entity33 key to @entity34 ' @entity1 is a member of staff at the club , he has a position here and he is working with @entity9 , who will remain at the club			1
’ @entity1 was promoted to the first - team fold following the sacking of @entity43 in april as he assisted close friend @entity23 after the @entity26 assumed managerial responsibilities at @entity5			2
once @entity50 was handed the job , there were suspicions that the @entity53 may look to weed out the influence of the @entity7 of ‘ 92 to make way for his own backroom staff but with @entity23 on board as assistant , the new manager has indicated his desire to maintain a link with @entity0 ’s heritage			0
however , the future of @entity60 , who followed @entity43 from @entity61 to @entity0 last summer in the position of first - team coach , remains clouded in mystery			2
it is understood that discussions are continuing at @entity0 over whether @entity60 be remain at @entity5 under @entity4 but it would seem unlikely that he will maintain such a senior position at the club next season			1
a @entity0 insider was keen to stress that the ‘ @entity7 ’ are ‘ part of the fabric of the football club ’ but @entity60 , who is currently working as a @entity73 pundit at the @entity74 , is still to be informed what role , if any at all , that the club can find for him following the exit of @entity43			1
new man : @entity53 manager @entity4 is due to take over at @entity0 after @entity83 's @entity74 campaign champion : @entity1 ( second from top ) was part of the 1999 treble - winning team and won 6 @entity89 titles @entity60 may exit as the club look to make a break with the dismal campaign endured by @entity43 , with @entity50 having already brought in @entity93 as his assistant coach , although it could yet be that @entity0 find a reduced role for the former @entity98 international			1
as for @entity99 , @entity0 had no plans in place to reintroduce the club legend to the coaching staff while @entity43 was in charge and as things stand , it seems unlikely that he will form a part of @entity50 ’s backroom team			2
@entity99 acted as a temporary assistant manager when @entity23 took over for the final four games of the season			0
he also teamed up with @entity1 to help his former team - mate coach the @entity0 youngsters for the @entity12 in the autumn but @entity16 understands that this arrangement was on a purely voluntary , non-contracted basis			0
class of 92 : @entity1 is one of several of @entity0 's golden generation who has gone on to work at the club video ' class of 92 ' to buy non-league @entity123 confident : @entity0 believe that @entity1 will stay in his role with the academy under @entity50 it was orchestrated by @entity1 , rather than @entity43 , and it remained a temporary role			1
it is distinctly possible that he will aid @entity128 on the same , ad - hoc basis next season			0
@entity99 does , however , remain a paid ambassador for @entity0 but he has not been contracted on a permanent basis as a member of the coaching staff since retiring in the summer of 2013			0
his chances of earning a senior position under @entity50 have also been dented by his outspoken views in his column for the bookmakers @entity139 , with the 39 - year - old particularly critical of @entity0 striker @entity141 and executive vice-chairman @entity142 , with @entity99 saying that the @entity0 chief has ‘ an awful lot to prove this time that he 's good enough at his job ’ in this summer transfer window .			0

@entity1 will continue in his role with the @entity0 academy
@entity4 to take over at the club after the @entity74
@entity1 worked at @entity0 academy under @entity43 , and assisted @entity23 in his role as interim manager at the end of last season
still *doubts* about roles for @entity60 and @entity99
