two days after struggling with her emotions on her competitive return to the @entity3 , @entity0 was in a much more relaxed mood on sunday as she powered her way into the fourth round			1
the @entity8 world no 1 , who made a nervous start before battling past @entity12 's @entity11 7 - 5 7 - 5 in her opening match , was back to business as usual with a 6 - 2 6 - 0 demolition of @entity17 's @entity16			1
' i was able to relax because i was able to do more of the right things and not make as many mistakes as i did in my last round , ' said @entity0 , who boycotted the @entity3 event for 14 years after winning the 2001 final			1
@entity0 made short work of @entity16 , winning 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 to reach the @entity3 fourth round @entity16 , of @entity17 , had little answer to the play of world no 1 @entity0 ' i think with that , that helped me to be able to relax even more			1

just trying to feel the rhythm and trying to focus on the ball more than anything else			0
' @entity0 , a 19 - times grand slam singles champion , had been apprehensive and ' a little nervous ' after finally deciding to return to @entity3 after such a long time away			1
fourteen years ago , she was booed by the crowd as she beat @entity39 in the final to win her second title at the @entity43 desert resort , where her father @entity44 alleged he had heard racist taunts			0
the heckling by the crowd was in apparent response to @entity0 's sister @entity48 having withdrawn from their semi-final that year just minutes before the match , citing injury			2
@entity0 believes that , despite an impressive performance against @entity16 , there is more to come @entity16 hits a forehand as she tried in vain to get a foothold in the match against @entity0 @entity0 said she felt more relaxed and back to normal against @entity16 than she did against @entity11 @entity0 and @entity16 congratulate each other at the net after the match came to a swift end on friday , however , @entity0 received a standing ovation before the start of her match against @entity11 , an experience she described as ' amazing '			1

' they were both really proud			0
' the standing ovation was amazing			0
i really felt excited by it			0
i think it 's been a really great learning experience for everyone involved			0
@entity0 was overwhelmed by the reception she got from crowd on her return to @entity3 after 14 years @entity0 was given a standing ovation during her game against @entity11 on friday ' it was what it was , but i have kind of like really tried to zone into tournament mode and tournament focus			2
that 's what i 'm just trying to get ready for the rest of the event			0
' against the outclassed @entity16 , @entity0 looked every inch a world no 1 , though she felt she still had some way to go before she reached her optimum tournament level			1
' i feel like i can do a lot better in terms of just being mentally prepared and mentally ready , ' said the 33 - year - old			2
' that 's what i 'm just going to try to do ... is just keep going			0
