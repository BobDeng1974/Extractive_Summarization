as new information continues to pour in about wednesday 's tragic shooting in @entity2 , gunman @entity4 's reasons for killing a solider and opening fire on @entity7 still remain very much unclear			1
a 2011 court statement from @entity4 could shed some light on the attacker 's past - and perhaps his motivations - as it was revealed today he had recently applied for a passport and planned to travel to @entity13 after undergoing a ' radicalization process '			1
@entity4 fatally shot corporal @entity15 at a national war memorial in the capital @entity18 on wednesday before racing through the parliament building where he was shot dead near where prime minister @entity20 was meeting with lawmakers			2
it has emerged that , three years ago , he begged prosecutors to put him in jail to help him beat his drug addiction			1
' i went to see the @entity43 , i told them , ' just put me in so i could do my time for what i confessed , '' said @entity4 , in audio tapes obtained by @entity46			1
so , i warned them , ' if you ca n't keep me in , i 'm going to do something right now just to be put in			0
' so i went to do another robbery just so i could come to jail			2
' that robbery happened just hours later , when he went into a @entity55 's with nothing but a sharpened stick and demanded all the money in the cash register			1
police who arrested him on the scene said he seemed ' happy			0
' he then told the judge at his hearing , which happened after the incident at @entity69 but was for a likely parole violation stemming from a different robbery charge that occurred in @entity72 and for which he had already served two years , ' i 'm a crack addict and at the same time i 'm a religious person , so i want to sacrifice freedom and good things for a year maybe , so when i come out , i 'll appreciate the things of life more and be clean			1
' he added , ' the reason i am here is because i wanted to come in			0
the police said they could n't keep me , so i went to do a crime to come to jail			2
so if you release me what 's going to happen again ? probably the same loop and i 'm going to be right back here again			0
' @entity89 home : @entity4 was staying at @entity91 ( above ) , a homeless shelter , while living in @entity89 @entity18 home : he was last staying at the @entity94 ( above ) , a shelter in @entity18 oddly enough , the prosecutor said @entity4 had already served his time and should not be allowed to go to prison , but the judge agreed to put him away , initially just over the holidays , and he stayed there , it appears , until his hearing in february 2012 involving the incident at @entity69			1
at the time , @entity4 thanked the judge , and said , ' perfect			0
' in the @entity55 's case however , they could only charge @entity4 with uttering threats and , having already served 66 days in prison since december , he received just one additional day			1
the judge said to him , ' good luck sir			0
' it comes as police revealed he had recently applied for a passport , planning to travel to @entity13 after undergoing a ' radicalization process			1
' @entity4 , 32 , was a @entity2 who may also have held @entity117 citizenship , said @entity118 , commissioner of the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			1
he said the suspect had no apparent links to another @entity2 who killed a soldier in @entity72 earlier in the week			1
' we need to investigate and understand his radicalization process			0
he is an interesting individual in that he had a very well - developed criminality , ' @entity118 said			0
' there is no one path or one formula to radicalization			0
' he had recently applied for a passport and had arrived in @entity18 on oct. 2 to try to speed that process , but checks by the @entity43 did not turn up any evidence of national security - related criminality despite criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs , violence and other criminal activities , @entity118 said			1
in mourning : the @entity2 flag flew at half - mast today in memory of wednesday 's tragedy meanwhile , @entity2 foreign minister @entity34 has said there is ' no evidence ' linking @entity4 to a wider group , or network , of jihadists			1
what there is plenty of evidence of however , after multiple interviews with people who knew the 32 - year - old shooter , is his struggle with drugs , and his desperate desire to kick his addictions			0
@entity161 , who became close with @entity162 convert @entity4 as a result of their shared faith when they both lived at the same shelter , the @entity94 , told the @entity168 , ' for two weeks he was communicative , but then when he collapsed into drugs , he became isolated			0
' he added , ' his intention was to get passport and get home			0
he had to stay away from drugs			0
' @entity4 , as it has been reported , was unable to get his passport to travel to the @entity175			2
another man , who wished to remain anonymous and lived with @entity4 at @entity91 , a shelter in @entity89 , @entity178 , said that he met him in 2012 as he was in detox ' fighting off an addiction to crack cocaine and heroin			2
' he said @entity4 relied on ' constant prayer ' to fight off addictions			0
sneaking off : it was also revealed he was asked to leave his mosque , @entity187 ( above ) , for sleeping there without permission , not extremist views it has also been revealed that the young man was not asked to leave his mosque , @entity187 , in @entity192 , @entity178 , because he had any extremist views , but rather because he had begun sleeping there without permission			1
' at some point , when he got in trouble with the law , and he did n't have a place to go to , he started sleeping at the mosque without any authorization , ' said @entity202 , a member of the @entity203			2
' when the mosque administration found out it , they asked him to leave immediately and asked him never to do that again			1
' the young man apparently stole the keys despite these instructions , and soon the locks were changed and he was told to never return			0
@entity202 said there were no signs of ' radicalized behavior , ' and had there been , members of the mosque would have noticed immediately as they ' do n't tolerate that kind of extremist mindset			0
' what this reasoning does not explain however , if true , is why the young man would choose to commit such a horrific act if all he desired was to be put in jail .			2

@entity2 gunman @entity28 asked the @entity43 to put him in jail in 2011 for an armed robbery he *claimed* to have committed 10 years prior
when they *refused* he said if they did not , he was going to do something ' just to get put in , ' and hours later tried to rob a @entity55 's
he then appeared in court a few days later , for a hearing on a previous robbery in @entity72 , and begged the judge to put him away so he could ' overcome his crack addiction '
the prosecutor in the case said he should not go away , but he managed to spend 66 days in prison after *pleading* with the judge
this comes as @entity2 foreign minister @entity34 says there is currently ' no evidence ' of any terrorist ties in the shooting
it is also now being reported he was asked to leave his mosque for sleeping there without permission , not for having extreme views
police reveal he had applied for passport and planned to go to @entity13
