by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:54 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 10:35 est , 13 december 2013 most voters fear they would be worse off or have made no progress under @entity4 , according to a damning poll			1
six out of ten @entity6 believe they would be poorer or no better off if @entity8 's party was in power today			1
the findings are a major blow to mr @entity8 as @entity13 leader @entity12 claims he is now taking more votes from @entity4 than the @entity15 in key marginals			1
blow : despite @entity4 accusing the government of a ' cost of living crisis ' , most voters do not think they would be any better off under @entity8 's party some 32 per cent felt they would be poorer if @entity4 had won the 2010 election and 31 per cent thought they would be ' much the same '			1
just a quarter believed they would be wealthier under mr @entity8			1
@entity4 's lead over the @entity24 has narrowed to just four points , down from six in a previous poll			1
the main opposition party is now on 39 , while the @entity15 are on 35 per cent with @entity13 on 11 , ahead of the @entity28 on 9			1
the poll showed that @entity4 is trailing on economic credibility			2
some 42 per cent believe the country would be worse off economically under @entity4 , with just 21 per cent disagreeing			2
the @entity34 poll for @entity35 shows how the @entity37 's vow to ease the squeeze on the cost of living is failing to resonate with voters			2
coalition ministers have tried to outflank mr @entity8 's most eye - catching policy of freezing energy prices by matching it with a pledge to roll back green taxes			2
if @entity4 had won the last election how would the economy be doing under @entity4 ? shoppers stocking up on everything they need for a @entity53 dinner face paying up to 28 per cent more than they did just three years ago			1
the price of turkeys , potatoes , cakes , wine and chocolates have risen several times faster than wages , hitting families in the pocket			0
@entity4 claimed the figures means there will be ' real worry ' about the cost of celebrating this year , and accused the government of failing to boost wages as the economy recovers			1
figures compiled by @entity4 show how the price of festive favourites have risen dramatically			2
poultry has soared by 14.6 per cent since may 2010 , hitting anyone planning to serve traditional turkey on the big day			0
even more alarmingly potatoes have soared by 28.1 per cent , more than double the rate of inflation of 12.7 per cent over the same period			0
however wages have risen by just 6 per cent since the election			0
anyone with a sweet tooth will also feel the pinch , with biscuits and cakes up 21 per cent and sweets and chocolates 18.3 per cent more expensive			0
the cost of a @entity53 tipple has also risen , with wine and spirits up 14.5 per cent			0
but privately , senior @entity15 believe that voters will put a party 's competence to steer the country out of recession ahead of populist policies			2
the government has been stung by criticism that despite a return to economic growth most people feel no better off			0
wages have risen by a fraction of the increase in prices			0
but yesterday chancellor @entity109 seized on figures from the @entity111 showing that average earnings were now keeping pace with inflation			0
he told the @entity115 : ‘ it shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent			0
' that is , of course , the current rate of inflation			0
so i think that points to the broader argument that i have been making , which is that as the economy recovers , that is the route to a sustained increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy , and you ca n't pretend that the two are n't connected , that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan			0
’ @entity13 leader @entity12 also revealed that his party was taking more votes from @entity4 than conservatives in marginal seats			1
he said he wanted to overturn the myth that by voting @entity13 , the country would let in @entity4 by the backdoor			1
a poll to be released next week would ' really stun people ' he told @entity142			0
' it 's going to show that in most of our target constituencies the vast majority of our votes are not coming from conservatives			0
' yes , we get conservative votes but we 're picking up huge numbers of old @entity4 votes from @entity152 and @entity153 but we 're also picking up a lot of votes from people who have given up voting completely , ' he said			1
mr @entity12 added : ' the idea of " vote @entity13 , get @entity8 " is wrong and there are now some marginal seats in this country where actually the only party that could beat @entity4 is @entity13			1

32 ***%*** think they would have been poorer if @entity4 won the last election
31 ***%*** thought they would be ' much the same ' and only *25* ***%*** said ' better off '
@entity8 has accused the government of a ' cost of living crisis '
@entity12 *insists* @entity13 is taking more votes from @entity4 than the @entity15
