by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 24 october 2013 he famously said he wanted a poor church to help the poverty stricken			0
and it would appear that @entity5 is following up on his promise , by expelling a @entity8 bishop from his diocese pending the outcome of a church inquiry into his 31 million - euro ( Â£ 26.4million ) new residence complex			1
the @entity14 did n't say how long @entity16 @entity15 , 53 , would spend away from the diocese of @entity18 but it refused calls to remove him permanently			1
it gave no information on where he would go or what he would do			0
bishop @entity15 ( left ) has been expelled by @entity5 following the spending of some 31 million euros on a residence at the centre of the controversy is the huge price tag for the construction of a new bishop 's residence complex and related renovations			1
@entity15 has defended the expenditures , saying the bill was actually for 10 projects and there were additional costs because the buildings were under historical protection			1
but in a country where @entity42 launched the reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the church , the outcry has been enormous			0
the perceived lack of financial transparency has also struck a chord since a church tax in @entity8 brings in billions a year to the @entity8 church			0
@entity15 's leadership style has also been criticised			1
in august and september , more than 4,000 people signed an open letter to the bishop criticising what they considered his authoritarian style			2
people walk past a part of the residence of @entity15 , @entity63 , in @entity18 , @entity8 the head of the @entity8 bishops ' conference , archbishop @entity64 , has been particularly blunt in his criticism of the expenditures and the credibility problem it was causing the church			1
he said the ' decisive ' turning point came when @entity74 prosecutors earlier this month asked a court to levy an unspecified fine against the bishop for false testimony in a related case			2
@entity64 has said the church commission will investigate the costs of the renovation , the financing and how decisions about the restoration evolved			0
canon lawyers will determine if @entity15 violated church law regarding the use of church money , @entity64 said			2
in a highly unusual move , bishop @entity15 of @entity18 was ordered to leave his diocese while an investigation and audit into cost over-runs is held in a statement , @entity64 pledged that the commission would do its work ' quickly and carefully			1
' @entity5 ' decision opens ' a space to return to inner calm and create a new basis for talks , ' he said			0
the @entity14 stressed that @entity5 took the decision based on ' objective ' information , suggesting that the @entity14 was n't being swayed by the popular outcry			1
@entity5 has also made it clear he expects his bishops to live simply , setting as an example his own humble lifestyle			0
@entity15 met with @entity5 on monday			2
@entity15 's leadership style has also been criticized yesterday the @entity14 said the bishop was leaving pending the outcome of a @entity8 church investigation into the expenditures and his role in the affair			1
fellow bishops and lay @entity119 in the diocese , however , expressed doubt that he would ever be able to return			2
' this is a crisis of confidence that will be hard to overcome , ' said the dean of the cathedral chapter , @entity128			0
@entity18 's vicar general , the rev. @entity129 , who had been due to start january 1 , will instead begin work immediately and will run the diocese during @entity15 's absence , the @entity14 said			1
@entity8 's main lay catholic group , the @entity133 , praised the decision			0
' @entity5 ' decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the @entity18 diocese , because the situation had become an increasing burden for the faithful there and in all of @entity8 , ' said @entity144 , the group 's head			1
the @entity8 government refused to comment on the matter			0
@entity148 , bishop of @entity149 , said the pope had made a ' smart ' decision which gives all concerned time to review the situation calmly			0
but in comments to the @entity8 newspaper @entity155 , he cast doubt on @entity15 ever returning to @entity18			1
' there is a fundamental crisis of confidence in @entity18			2
the situation there is a mess , ' @entity148 was quoted as saying .			0
