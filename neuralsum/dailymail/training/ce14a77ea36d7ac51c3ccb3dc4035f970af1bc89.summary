older people at risk of going blind are being treated by a new x-ray procedure for the first time on the @entity5			1
the one - off treatment combats a form of age - related macular degeneration ( @entity9 ) , a disease affecting around 250,000 @entity11			1
it targets the ‘ wet ’ variation of the condition in particular – which develops when abnormal blood vessels form under a tiny part of the retina called the macula			2
@entity19 has become the first @entity5 hospital in the @entity11 to start offering appropriate patients a new non-invasive treatment for wet age - related macular degeneration monthly eye injections are the usual course of treatment , but the x-ray – called @entity28 – has been found to almost halve the number needed			1
and at £ 700 per injection , it means that costs for the @entity5 can be cut considerably while reducing the inconvenience for patients			1
some have not needed an injection for three years following the therapy , which delivers painless , highly - targeted low - level radiation similar to that used in dental x-rays			2
‘ @entity9 is an aggressive form of one of the most common eye diseases , ’ said @entity41 , consultant ophthalmologist at @entity43 ’s @entity42			2
‘ treatment can often be uncomfortable , with patients needing injections on a monthly or two - monthly basis , or in perpetuity			1
‘ current treatments can cost the @entity5 upwards of £ 700 per injection , so not only should @entity28 benefit patients but it will also be more cost effective			1
just two fewer injections per patient makes the treatment cost - effective			2
’ @entity9 normally affects people over the age of 60 , with the wet form progressing particularly quickly			1
around 26,000 people a year are diagnosed with wet @entity9			1
there is no way of preventing the condition , however laser surgery and drugs can limit the damage it causes			0
but doctors at the @entity43 hospital have started using @entity28 to deliver a dose of radiation to the back of affected patients ’ eyes			0
it is a non-invasive procedure that is over in just a few minutes			0
the procedure works by drying up any leakage caused by the uncontrolled production of new blood vessels			0
by focusing the beams on the back of the eye , scarring is reduced it works by drying up any leakage caused by the uncontrolled production of new blood vessels			0

mr @entity41 said a @entity91 clinical trial found treatment cut the need for monthly injections by 45 per cent on average – however patients still needed regular check - ups and some did better than others at avoiding top - up injections			1
he added : ‘ the ideal scenario is a patient needing no additional injections after once - only treatment with @entity28 , and their condition becomes stable			2
‘ but injections are still a valuable option for many patients as the new treatment will not be appropriate for everyone			0
’ @entity111 , an 83 - year - old retired sewing machine operator from @entity43 , was one of the first to be treated with @entity28			0
she said : ‘ i was diagnosed with wet @entity9 in my left eye three years ago and since then i have had nine injections in the eye			1
‘ i do n’t like the injections , nor the regular 28 - mile round trip to the hospital , so the x-ray therapy was very appealing to me			0
’ the therapy is due to be used at @entity5 clinics in @entity122 , @entity123 and other cities in @entity125 .			0
