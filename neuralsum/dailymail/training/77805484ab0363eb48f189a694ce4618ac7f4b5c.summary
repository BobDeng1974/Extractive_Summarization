six years ago she created a statue of a ‘ typical family ’ showing a mother , father and two children			1
asked to do something similar in @entity10 , however , @entity8 has come up with a sculpture which many may feel is far from typical			1
her £ 100,000 work representing what it means to be an ‘ ordinary ’ family in 2014 is of two single mothers and their children			1
sisters @entity17 and @entity19 and their sons @entity21 and @entity22 were chosen from 372 nominations to be the subjects of a @entity25			1
the £ 100,000 bronze sculpture immortalises the @entity28 family made up by sisters @entity19 and @entity17 and their sons @entity21 and @entity22 the real thing : sisters @entity17 and @entity19 with their sons , pictured next to the statue which depicts their family set - up the family stand next to their sculpture in @entity40 ( left ) - which is a million miles away from the artist 's depiction of a typical family in @entity7 , created six years ago , which is made up of a more conventional mother , father and two kids ( right ) the bronze sculpture by the @entity50 winner shows the four of them hand - in - hand and @entity19 heavily pregnant with her second son , @entity53 , now eight months old			1
but the absence of any adult male or father figure has drawn criticism			1
the mixed race sisters , who live separately , have not revealed details of their family set - up , leaving many to ask why the fathers are n’t included in the piece			2
@entity63 mp @entity62 said : ‘ there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with single parent families but i always find it sad when fathers are not involved in the lives of their children			1
’ the @entity70 also questioned why public money was spent on such a controversial sculpture			1
‘ when the council ca n’t afford to clear up the rubbish on the streets , £ 100,000 is not peanuts , ’ he said			1
@entity77 , of the charity @entity78 , said : ‘ everybody knows that families can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but this interpretation of a family seems most bizarre			1
it is factually inaccurate and totally out of step			0
‘ children do better when they have both their mother and their father playing an active role in their lives			2
’ dr @entity94 , a leading researcher on family policy , said the artist ’s decision to portray a fatherless family was ‘ a disgrace ’			0
‘ we should know whether or not there ’s a man involved here , ’ she said			0
‘ is he taking responsibility , living with them , or not ? these are things the viewer needs to know			0
‘ they are putting this up as some kind of ideal which people have to be like or have to evolve in this direction , but it represents under 1 per cent of the population			0
’ the sisters say the sculpture will help other families with unusual set - ups feel welcome in @entity40			1
the artwork took four years to complete after artist @entity8 invited members of the public to nominate local families the family was chosen for their closeness , said @entity8 , who took inspiration from carrying out a similar project in @entity7 one of the sisters , who are both single , is depicted as pregnant			1
hundreds of families were nominated as part of the project the sculpture is designed to celebrate ' the unsung and everyday ' elements of @entity40 city life according to organisers after receiving nominations and suggestions for a variety of family structures the artist and a panel of judges selected the @entity28 family speaking of the suggestions , one organiser said while a nuclear family was the most traditional , it is no longer the norm in @entity40 the sisters and their brothers , @entity153 , 25 , and @entity154 , 23 , were raised by their mother , @entity155 , a single parent , in a council house the plaque on the sculpture , which describes those featured in the work of art @entity8 was born in @entity40 in 1963			1
the artist shot to fame in the 1990s with a collection of photographs she had taken of strangers in the street , holding up signs with ' confessions ' written on them			0
speaking of the project , @entity8 said she had been inspired by the @entity10 tendency to bottle up emotion and not reveal secrets			2
in 1997 she won the @entity50 for 60 minutes silence , a film of uniformed police officers sitting together			0
wearing was elected as lifetime member of the @entity180 in @entity181 in 2007			0
@entity17 , 29 , mother of four - year - old @entity21 , and @entity19 , 27 , mother of @entity22 , five , and @entity53 , said they have experienced difficult times together and have ‘ always been there for each other ’			1
@entity17 , an outreach worker for a charity , said : ‘ we were interested in representing women , representing single parents and also mixed race people , which are such a part of @entity40			1
because there is n’t an adult male ... we thought that would be an issue and that ’s why possibly we would n’t be chosen			2
’ she added : ‘ there ’s always the expectation that in future we might be a complete family because perhaps there will be a male there			0
but i do n’t see it like that			0
we ’re women , we support each other and obviously we ’ve got the males there – our sons			0
potentially they are going to be fathers in the future			0
’ the sisters and their brothers , @entity153 , 25 , and @entity154 , 23 , were raised by their mother , @entity155 , a single parent , in a council house in @entity40			1
@entity215 described the four siblings as ‘ polite and well - brought up ’ , but said their mother , @entity28 , was somewhat aloof			2
one couple who knew the family well said : ‘ @entity155 never used to let anybody in the house			0
the two daughters would visit with their children almost daily			0
occasionally , one of the women would drive round with her boyfriend			0
but while the daughter went in to see @entity155 , the boyfriend would always stay in the car			0
’ another neighbour , who also declined to be identified , said : ‘ the sisters both seem to be devoted parents raising happy and well - rounded children			2
but @entity40 has tried hard in recent years to position itself in a positive light and this statue sends the wrong message			2
this is the @entity10 ’s second city , and while it is diverse , i do n’t know of any modern family made up of two single mothers who are also sisters			1
’ @entity155 ’s mother @entity240 , 70 , who also lives in @entity40 , said : ‘ i ’m proud that my granddaughters have been chosen as the faces of @entity40			2
they are lovely girls who have been raised the right way			0
’ miss @entity8 , who won the @entity50 in 1997 and is the partner of artist @entity245 , said : ‘ a nuclear family is one reality but it is one of many and this work celebrates the idea that what constitutes a family should not be fixed			2
’ her previous statue of a family stands in @entity256 , @entity7			0
the new sculpture , which stands outside the @entity258 and was commissioned by the city ’s @entity259 , was made in @entity261 and financed by a mixture of public money and private donations .			1

@entity8 invited @entity40 *residents* to nominate the most ' real ' family in the city to be immortalised
*based* sculpture on the @entity28 family made up by sisters and single mothers @entity19 and @entity17 and their children
the £ 100,000 bronze artwork was unveiled in @entity277 outside the new @entity278 today
the absence of any adult male figure has drawn criticism with one charity saying interpretation is ' most bizarre '
@entity63 mp @entity62 , a @entity70 , also questionned why public money had been spent on project
artist created similar sculpture in @entity7 six years ago - consisting of a more conventional mother , father and two kids
