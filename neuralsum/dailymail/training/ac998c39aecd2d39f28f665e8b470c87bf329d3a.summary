by @entity0 @entity1 can offer no excuses for his poor start as @entity5 technical director @entity4 says it 's simply because he 's driving ' slower than @entity7 at the moment '			1
the anticipated duel with @entity8 has failed to materialise with the @entity11 out - qualifying @entity1 in four of the six races and , crucially , finishing ahead in every grand prix			1
@entity1 is languishing in 12th place while @entity8 is the best of the rest when it comes to drivers ' standings , third only to runaway @entity21 pair @entity20 and @entity22			1
slow start : @entity1 ( pictured ) has failed to ignite a duel with @entity5 team - mate @entity8 losing battle : @entity1 was out - qualified in four of six races by @entity8 and sits 12th in the drivers ' standings speed : @entity1 has been urged to up his game by @entity5 technical director @entity4 in terms of points , @entity8 has amassed 61 compared to @entity1 's less - than - impressive 17			1
@entity8 is in his fifth season with @entity5 and has full knowledge of how the team works , while @entity1 is only in the first year of his return to the @entity38 marque			1
the cars , however , were a clean slate given the radical regulations			0
but @entity1 seems to not have adapted to the changes as naturally as @entity8			1
' i 'm not sure it 's entirely fair to say he is struggling more than @entity7 , ' said @entity46 in assessing @entity1 's form to date ahead of this weekend 's @entity48 in @entity49			1
' they both have similar feedback with the car , and there are aspects of this year 's rules that make the cars across the pit - lane a far from easy aspect for the driver			0
' there is a lot more torque from the engine , a lot less aerodynamic grip , and the tyres are deliberately less aggressive than last year			0
' all that means they are quite a handful to drive , not too breezy for anyone , be that at the front or back of the grid			0
' the problems @entity74 has with the car under braking , downshifting , are the same as @entity7 , and pretty much the same as being experienced by other drivers at other teams			2
' he 's just going a little slower than @entity7 at the moment , but that gap is closing as the year progresses			2
' no contest : @entity8 has adapted to the radical changes more naturally than his @entity5 team - mate looking down : @entity1 has a mere 17 points compared to @entity8 's 61 in the drivers ' standings @entity5 expected to be in the hunt for this year 's championships , only for @entity21 to outclass them after the rules overhaul			1
it is @entity46 's first full season as technical director after leaving @entity94 a year ago , and he recognises the sizable task			2
making a car quick that was n't quick in the first race is a particularly challenging task , ' added @entity46			0
' it 's very difficult to produce a rate of improvement substantially different to the people we are fighting with			0
' however , we 've had a race or two where the pieces we took to the track were useful , but not big steps forward			0
' we hope in the coming races to have a more steady progression of things we hope will lift us up in our competitiveness			0
' but we wo n't know for sure until we get there because it depends on what everyone else does			0
' i do n't think we can claim to have produced a chassis that is , at the moment , the equal of either the @entity21 or the @entity119			2
' we 're not lagging hugely behind , but there is work for us to do before we can hold our hands up and say we are completely happy with the chassis performance			0
' view : @entity1 ended in 12th in the @entity125 @entity124 , while @entity8 finished a more respectable fourth			1

@entity5 technical director @entity4 admits @entity1 is ' going a little slower than @entity7 ( @entity8 ) at the moment '
@entity8 out - qualified @entity1 in four of the six races and finished ahead in every grand prix
@entity8 is third in drivers ' standings , behind @entity21 ' @entity20 and @entity22 , while @entity1 is 12th
