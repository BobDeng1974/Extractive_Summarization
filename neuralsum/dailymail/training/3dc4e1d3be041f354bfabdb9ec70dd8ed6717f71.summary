a boys ' club who had a rare piece of @entity5 artwork left on their front door have had it valued on the @entity7 for £ 400,000			1
the work , called @entity9 had appeared overnight on a plank of wood screwed to a wall close to the @entity13 in @entity5 's home town of @entity15			1
@entity16 from the club , became involved in a row with the local council after removing the artwork put on a public wall near the youth club			1
however , the artwork was removed by the city council , who maintained they owned the wall , and put on display in @entity15			1
but the artist waded into the argument by writing a letter to the club 's owner , giving him his ' blessing ' to do what he felt was right with the art. mr @entity16 , 58 , has now had the piece valued by experts from the @entity7 , who were filming in @entity15			1
he said he was hoping to keep a low profile , but everyone at the mansion house recognised the piece immediately			0
gallery owner and expert , @entity26 , told mr @entity16 that selling the artwork for £ 400,000 would be a ' good deal '			1
confirmation : the artist waded in to the row by writing a letter to @entity16 , who runs the club , giving him his ' blessing ' to do what he felt was right with the art the youth club owner said : ' i am looking to sell the @entity5 at the highest price , and i just took it down to get an expert opinion			1
' i 'm not an art dealer and i 've got no idea what i am doing			0
he said it was like everything else - @entity5 is an incredibly hard thing to put a price on			2
' and the reason behind that is there are no set fees or prices , but it is a very unique piece			0
' they also said in real terms , if somebody offers me £ 400,000 , that would be a good deal			1
' a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush , and it is better to just get the money in the bank			0
funding : mr @entity16 said the sale of the piece would safeguard the club ( pictured ) as well as help fund other youth projects in the area popular : a couple joke around next to the @entity5 artwork , painted onto a wooden board bolted to the wall ' i could take it to auction and get no more for it , so we are in between a rock and hard place really , on making a decision			1
' but the people there today were amazing , everyone was going mad for it			0
' everyone was taking photos and gathering round			0
i was hoping to keep it quiet but everyone saw me there , and i guess it will end up on tv now			0
' but i am just trying to do my job properly and get the most money for my boys			0
' it is thought the piece is worth more than other pieces of @entity5 work , due to a handwritten note delivered to the club by the artist himself			1
row : @entity131 said it was not ' 100 per cent sure of the ownership ' of the wall the artwork was attached to , and days later removed the piece with the support of police safe keeping : before the artwork was taken by the council , the club had removed it from the wall and positioned it inside to protect it from vandals mr @entity16 has approached a number of wealthy businessmen , including @entity147 , in a bid to get the best price for the work			1
the painting was first discovered at the club in @entity153 ’s , @entity15 , on april 15 after @entity5 posted a picture of the new design on his website			1
they removed the artwork to protect it from vandals and put it on display inside the club			2
however , @entity131 said it was not ' 100 per cent sure of the ownership ' of the wall the artwork was attached to , and days later removed the piece with the support of police			1
resemblance : some critics of the piece have suggested the man in the painting looks like former prime minister @entity174 it was put on display at @entity177 while its ownership was decided and more than 10,000 people viewed it over the @entity180 weekend alone			1
but on may 6 , mr @entity16 received the letter from @entity5 , who gave the cash - strapped boys club permission to sell it			1
the following day the city 's mayor @entity184 received a similar letter from @entity5 confirming it was genuine			2
the artist had written : ' i do n't normally admit to committing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges wo n't be brought anytime soon you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece			0
' i 'm a great admirer of the work done at the club and would be chuffed if this can help in some way			0
' @entity200 - based street artist @entity5 is known worldwide for his stencils which often carries political messages or questions about society			2
despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for thousands , his true identity remains a secret - leading to a network of myths surrounding him and it is rumoured that his own parents do n't know what he does , believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator			0
there is also the suggestion that @entity5 is actually a collective of artists and does n't exist at all			2
@entity5 's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism			2
however by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation			0
he has allegedly been photographed in the past but has always been wearing a mask or hood			0
in 2008 he was reportedly ' unmasked ' as @entity231 , a former public schoolboy from @entity15 with a passion for art. at the time @entity5 's agent refused to confirm or deny the story			2
@entity5 then wrote on his website : ' i am unable to comment on who may or may not be @entity5 , but anyone described as being ' good at drawing ' does n't sound like @entity5 to me			2
' fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film @entity242 - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated			0
his most famous artworks include @entity246 - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and @entity250 , which he has created several versions of across @entity253 including @entity254 and the @entity255			0
@entity5 's top sellers include :			0
