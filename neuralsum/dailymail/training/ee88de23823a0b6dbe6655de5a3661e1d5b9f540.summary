a @entity1 fresco of children boxing : new dna analysis has debunked the theory that the @entity1 were refugees from @entity5 dna analysis has debunked the longstanding theory that the @entity1 , who some 5,000 years ago established @entity10 's first advanced @entity9 culture , were from @entity5			1
the @entity1 civilisation arose on the @entity13 island of @entity14 in approximately the 27th century @entity15 and flourished for 12 centuries until the 15th century @entity17 but the culture was lost until @entity20 archaeologist sir @entity19 unearthed its remains on @entity14 in 1900 , where he found vestiges of a civilisation he believed was formed by refugees from northern @entity27			1
modern archaeologists have cast doubt on that version of events , and now dna tests of @entity1 remains suggests they were descended from ancient farmers who settled the islands thousands of years earlier			1
these people , it is believed , are from the same stock that came from the @entity38 to populate the rest of @entity10			0
@entity19 set to work on @entity14 in 1900 with a team of archaeologists soon after the island was liberated from the yoke of the @entity44 , almost immediately unearthing a great palace			1
he named the civilisation he discovered after the legendary @entity48 king @entity49 and , based on likenesses between @entity1 artifacts and those from @entity27 and @entity53 , proposed that its founders migrated into the area from @entity5			1
since then , other archaeologists have suggested that the @entity1 may have come from other regions , possibly @entity59 , the @entity60 , or the @entity38			1
but now a joint @entity62 and @entity48 team has made a mitochondrial dna analysis of @entity1 skeletal remains to determine the likely ancestors of the ancient people			2
@entity67 , the energy powerhouses of cells , contain their own dna , or genetic code , and because mitochondrial dna is passed down from mothers to their children via the human egg , it contains information about maternal ancestry			0
findings suggest that the @entity1 civilisation arose from the population already living in @entity14 , and that these people were probably descendants of the first humans to reach there about 9,000 years ago			1
further , they found , the remains have the greatest genetic similarity with modern @entity85 populations			0
senior researcher dr @entity86 , professor of medicine and genome sciences at the @entity89 , said the analysis showed these people probably came to the area from the @entity38 , not the @entity92			0
@entity93 at @entity94 : the @entity1 culture , @entity10 's first advanced civilisation , arose on the @entity13 island of @entity14 in approximately the 27th century @entity15 and flourished for 12 centuries ' about 9,000 years ago there was an extensive migration of @entity103 humans from the regions of @entity105 that today comprise parts of @entity59 and the @entity38 , ' he said			1
' at the same time , the first @entity103 inhabitants reached @entity14			2
' our mitochondrial dna analysis shows that the @entity1 ' strongest genetic relationships are with these @entity103 humans , as well as with ancient and modern @entity111			2
' these results suggest the @entity1 civilization arose 5,000 years ago in @entity14 from an ancestral @entity103 population that had arrived in the region about 4,000 years earlier			1
' our data suggest that the @entity103 population that gave rise to the @entity1 also migrated into @entity10 and gave rise to modern @entity85 peoples			2
' dr @entity86 and his team analysed samples from 37 skeletons found in a cave in @entity14 â€™s @entity127 plateau and compared them with mitochondrial dna sequences from 135 modern and ancient human populations			2
the @entity1 samples revealed 21 distinct mitochondrial dna variations , of which six were unique to the @entity1 and 15 were shared with modern and ancient populations			2
none of the @entity1 carried mitochondrial dna variations characteristic of @entity5 populations			0
further analysis showed that the @entity1 were only distantly related to @entity27 , @entity53 , and other @entity5 populations			1
indeed , the @entity1 shared the greatest percentage of their mitochondrial dna variation with @entity85 populations , especially those in @entity142 and @entity10			0
a restored clay vessel at the @entity145 ruins : sir @entity19 , who discovered the civilisation , proposed his theory of its origin based on likenesses between @entity1 artefacts and those from @entity27 and @entity53 when plotted geographically , shared @entity1 mitochondrial dna variation was lowest in @entity5 and increased progressively across the @entity38 , @entity154 , @entity13 islands , @entity156 , and mainland @entity10			1
the highest percentage of shared @entity1 mitochondrial dna variation was found with @entity103 populations from @entity156			0
the analysis also showed a high degree of sharing with the current population of the @entity163 and @entity48			0
in fact , the maternal genetic information passed down through many generations of mitochondria is still present in modern - day residents of the area where the @entity1 skeletons were found			0
dr @entity86 said he believes that the findings highlight the importance of dna analysis as a tool for understanding human history			0
' genetic analyses are playing in increasingly important role and predicting and protecting human health , ' he said			0
' our study underscores the importance of @entity174 not only in helping us to have healthier futures , but also to understand our past			0

@entity20 archaeologists who in 1900 discovered the @entity1 culture believed they were from @entity53 or @entity27
the @entity1 civilisation arose on @entity14 in the 27th century @entity15 and flourished until the 15th century @entity15
