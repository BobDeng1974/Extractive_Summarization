guests at a theme park hotel in @entity2 will be checked in and have their luggage delivered to their room by robots as well as use their faces to access their rooms			1
@entity8 at the @entity10 theme park is situated just outside @entity11 , and will be offering cutting edge technology that could set a precedent for the future			1
interestingly , the @entity16 word ' henn ' translates into @entity17 as change			0
robots , or androids , will check in guests at the @entity22 - na theme park hotel in @entity2 it is believed 10 robot staff will be sourced for jobs within the hotel , ranging from check - in to room cleaning			1
the hotel will offer guests the choice between using traditional hotel keys or face recognition to open their rooms			2
the robots are from the company that licenses @entity38			0
the @entity39 reported company president @entity40 as saying : ' we will make the most efficient hotel in the world			2
' in the future , we 'd like to have more than 90 percent of hotel services operated by robots			2
' and surprisingly the chance to see a whole new world of hotel service comes at a reasonable price			0
with lower staff costs due to using robots , rooms will become more affordable at the theme park hotel the robots will also be used to clean guests ' rooms as well as deliver up their luggage a single room will cost around £ 40 ( 7,000 @entity60 ) while a twin room will come in at £ 50 ( 9,000 @entity60 )			1
however , with the expected interest , especially in peak season , set to book out the hotel , guests will be invited to ' bid ' for a spot in the venue			0
but bidding for a single room will be capped at around £ 80 ( 14,000 @entity60 )			0
there is expected to be a great deal of interest in rooms at the tech - savvy hotel , so guests will have to bid for a place especially in peak season due to the operating costs being lower , prices in the @entity81 will be lower than the other hotels there that 's still some way behind the prices of the other hotels in the theme park , but this has been offset against the use of solar panels , lower staff rates and other power - saving equipment			1
july has been pencilled in as to when the first building containing 72 rooms will be opening , with plans for a second wing already being discussed			0
the theme park is modelled in typical @entity99 style in terms of its architecture and framework giving visitors a taste of the @entity99 .			1

@entity81 is at the @entity99 - *inspired* @entity10 theme park , @entity2
10 robot staff will operate a variety of jobs , *including* cleaning the rooms
