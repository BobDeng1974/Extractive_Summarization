by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 12:20 est , 19 september 2013 architects have used a 3d printer to create an intricately decorated room that looks a little like the interior of a cathedral			1
creative duo @entity6 and @entity7 made the grand space called ' @entity9 ' that measures 16 square metres and has an incredible 260 million facets			1
they said the project aims to create architecture that ' defies classification and reductionism ' as well as straddling chaos and order and the natural and artificial to produce a space that is ' neither foreign nor familiar '			0
the pair used algorithms to create the building , which while carefully designed , did not necessarily produce an ' entirely foreseeable result ' according to the architects			2
they think the @entity44 process can make surprising results that go beyond what could have have been conceived using traditional design techniques			0

while architects have recently used pen and paper or a cad program to design a form , the pair believe 3d printing makes the design process allows a new level of complexity and detail that was impossible to imagine before and ' bits and bytes can be rendered directly into reality '			2
mr @entity6 and mr @entity7 said : ' the combination of computational design and additive manufacturing can lead to a non-standardised , highly differentiated and spatially complex architecture that is defined at the scale of millimeters			2

the architects said : ' the closer one gets to the form , the more features one discovers			0
such a hierarchical differentiation can also be found in classic architecture			0

such a hierarchical differentiation can also be found in classic architecture while the use of 3d printing in architecture has been limited to producing prototypes as material costs are high and machines limited by size , mr @entity6 and mr @entity7 said sandstone - printing technology has emerged as an additive manufacturing technique that overcomes these limitations ' yet unlike traditional architectural design processes , here a single process is used both to sculpt the overall form , and to create the minute surface details			1

the architects believe @entity44 printed sandstone ( pictured ) has unique features that make it suitable to create architectural components as it allows the creation of large elements with lots of detail and accuracy at a competitive price in a short period of time they believe it has unique features that make it suitable to create architectural components as it allows the creation of large elements with lots of detail and accuracy at a competitive price in a short period of time			1
natural sandstone has been used as building material since prehistoric times and is a common material used to build cathedrals and ornamental structures as it is a relatively soft material that is easy to carve but has structural resistance - much like the new 3d - printed sandstone			1
in order to further harden the micro-detailing of the grotto and to increase the structural stability , the printed sandstone is infiltrated with resin			1
this resin closes the pores of the artificial sandstone			0
mr @entity6 and mr @entity7 believe the new technique could be used in the restoration of historic buildings as well as constructing new ones			1
