the exhibition , called ' @entity36 : @entity24 's @entity37 , 1936 - 1951 ' , recognises the role that an organisation of young , idealistic snappers played in seeing documentary photography as both an art form and a way to argue for social justice			1

the @entity37 's darkroom , exhibition space , and its acclaimed newsletter ' photo notes ' all drew photographers together in a space where they could socialise and exchange ideas			2
women actively participated in the league where they found rare access and recognition			0

the decade and a half of the @entity37 's existence spanned the @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and , finally , the ' @entity214 ' hunt for domestic @entity215 to which the @entity37 fell victim			2
a december 5 , 1947 front - page story in the @entity222 : ' @entity223 , @entity218 on @entity219 as @entity220 ' proved @entity224 for the @entity24 @entity37			1

the blacklisting affected @entity270 even after it was disbanded			0
' at least partly because of the suppression after the blacklisting , the significant role @entity279 - and its teacher @entity95 - played in the evolution of the documentary photograph has not been fully recognized , ' mr @entity96 said			2
' the subsequent generation of photographers was sort of apolitical			0
