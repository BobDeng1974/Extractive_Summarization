by @entity0 last updated at 9:56 pm on 20th december 2011 a former clergyman who gave away a pet water buffalo yesterday lost a final legal attempt to have the animal returned			0
@entity5 claimed he was delusional when he transferred @entity6 the buffalo and the one - acre field where he was kept to a friend who lived in the same village			1
he took his case to the county court last year , claiming mental health problems meant he lacked the capacity to make sensible decisions at the time of the handover in 2006			0
' disgusting decision ' : former clergyman @entity5 has lost a @entity20 battle to have oink the water buffalo ( pictured ) returned after a judge dismissed claims he was delusional when he transferred the beast to a friend but a judge ruled against mr @entity5 , 51 , after hearing evidence from a psychiatrist who believed mr @entity5 knew what he was doing when he made the ‘ gift ’ to @entity31			1
yesterday , the @entity20 backed the decision , bringing an end to the saga over the 18 - year - old beast			0
lord @entity36 said there would be ‘ no kindness ’ in allowing mr @entity5 's appeal to go any further as it had no hope of success and would only result in a bigger costs bill			1
outside court , mr @entity5 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , branded the decision ‘ absolutely despicable , disgraceful and disgusting ’			1
@entity6 became the subject of worldwide attention in 2008 when @entity50 cameras were installed to protect him from cruel thugs who had thrown bricks at him , laced his food with mustard , put detergent in his water and set fire to his hay			2
long legal fight : oink and the field in which he was kept in @entity44 , @entity45 , was handed to @entity31 in 2006 lord @entity36 told the @entity62 that mr @entity5 had been suffering from anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders when he signed over the animal in may 2006			1
he gave the 1.25 - tonne animal to @entity67 , who also had ‘ much affection ’ for the beast and was able to look after him , keeping him on the land where mr @entity5 could visit			1
lord @entity36 in his appeal application in @entity72 , mr @entity5 , representing himself , argued that @entity74 judge , recorder @entity73 , was wrong in his decision last year			1
he said the judge was wrong to reject his contention that he did not have capacity to make the gift and wrong to find that he had not been subject to ‘ undue influence ’			2
but @entity36 said the @entity74 judge had ‘ assessed the conflicting expert reports , looked at the contemporaneous records of the claimant 's medical conditions and reached a conclusion which seems to me to be plainly open to him			2
’ the @entity62 judge said : ‘ the relationship between the claimant and the defendant was not a relationship of a kind which gives rise to a claim for undue influence			1
‘ the claimant did not repose such degree of trust and confidence in the defendant as to give rise to a presumption of undue influence			0
' bleak message : the judge at the @entity20 ( above ) said mr @entity5 had no hope of his appeal going any further			1
he now faces paying most of miss @entity31 's legal costs he added : ‘ i appreciate that my decision will be a great disappointment to the claimant and i am sorry to be the messenger who brings that disappointment to the claimant			2
‘ on the other hand , facts must be faced			0
this is not an appeal which would have any prospect of success if it went forward			0
the appeal would fail and the claimant would be landed with a further bill of costs			0
’ mr @entity5 faces paying 90 per cent of mrs @entity31 's legal costs of the county court trial , but said he has not yet been told how much that will be			1
miss @entity31 , 62 , a divorcee , yesterday said the ruling was ‘ brilliant news ’			0
speaking from her home in @entity130 , she said : ‘ i had been effectively looking after @entity6 for seven years before i took him on in 2006			2
‘ i used to go past that field and feed him so often he ’d end up waiting for me at the gate			0
‘ @entity5 agreed to give me @entity6 and sold me the field for £ 2,000 which was the market value			2
then he turned around and claimed i ’d ripped him off			0
he is a complete menace			0

@entity62 judge rules @entity5 knew what he was doing when he transferred @entity6 to friend
mr @entity5 brands decision ‘ absolutely despicable , disgraceful and disgusting ’
