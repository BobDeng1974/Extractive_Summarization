@entity11 ' in large letters across images of travellers , including one of young children			1
the @entity17 and two members of the @entity19 have likened the word ' gypsier ' to other terms deemed racist and abusive			1

victory : the @entity0 is to formally investigate @entity2 's controversial advertising for @entity3 , after the @entity5 community successfully appealed the regulator 's original decision statement : billboards advertising the hit show across the country have seen graffiti scrawled across but now the @entity0 has made an embarrassing climb down and admitted its decision not to review the complaints was ' flawed			1
' the green light for the investigation to commence was given after a meeting between lord @entity43 and independent reviewer sir @entity44 , a former senior civil servant			0
the decision to investigate the series , which has pulled in up to 8 million viewers , is damaging to the show 's sponsor @entity48 and the car company admitted some viewers had rang them directly to lodge a complaint			1

meanwhile , travellers said they have been upset by the show and have found it ' insulting and degrading '			1
the documentary makers have also been accused of portraying traveller men as ' menacing '			0
the accusations came as earlier this month , the sons of @entity3 star @entity92 admitted their role in a violent street brawl between feuding gypsy clans			0
several men were involved in the punch - up when rival families clashed outside @entity101 magistrates court in @entity102			0

' it has decided that a formal investigation should now commence			0
' in their evaluation , the @entity143 noted that it had made its original decision without the benefit of knowing that the @entity5 of @entity104 had complained and that this was a material fact to which they should have had regard			2

travellers likened the word ' @entity11 ' to terms deemed racist and abusive
in march the @entity0 dismissed more than 370 complaints against the campaign
