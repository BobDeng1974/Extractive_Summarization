so you may wonder what on earth a tv satellite dish is doing nestled among the walls of its famous ramparts			0
this picture shows the very modern piece of technology clearly visible on the roof of the @entity15			1
mixing the old with the new : this picture shows a satellite dish on the rooftops of the @entity15 an onlooker said : ' it 's a real eye - sore			2
this is one of the most beautiful buildings in @entity26 - it should n't have ugly pieces of modern equipment tacked on to it			0
' i walk past the @entity15 most days and it 's a shame that a small thing like a tv satellite dish has been allowed to ruin the look of the building			1

' the @entity15 , which was first constructed in 1080 by @entity39 before being expanded by numerous monarchs , is a grade listed building			1
this means that planning permission is required for any changes to the building - including the addition of a satellite dish			1
the dish appears to be located on one of the newer parts of the building which is residential rented out to around 170 tenants - mainly @entity52 who are palace warders and their families			2

under the @entity94 , the @entity15 became used less as a royal residence , and provided the backdrop for numerous beheadings including that of @entity101 - @entity100 's second wife			1
the peak period of the castle 's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries , when many figures who had fallen into disgrace , such as @entity110 before she became queen , were held within its walls			0
executions were more commonly held on the notorious @entity114 to the north of the castle , with 112 occurring there over a 400 - year period			0
