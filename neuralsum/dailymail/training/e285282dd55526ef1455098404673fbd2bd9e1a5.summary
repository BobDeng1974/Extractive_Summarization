glorious failure was @entity2 ’s shattering fate at @entity3 on saturday , but their dejected , defiant response told its own story of rising standards and ambitions			1
after pushing the world champions to the brink of a monumental upset , @entity8 and his squad made it plain that being gallant losers will not suffice			0
there was a collective satisfaction about the way they had overcome considerable pre-match adversity to take the @entity20 to the edge of the abyss , but restrained pride was trumped by an acute sense of angst			1
this was not the mismatch widely predicted			0
it was a tight , tense , gruelling encounter and @entity2 were not behind until 10 minutes from the end			1
they were weakened , written off and cast as mere cannon fodder , but they would not accept that a @entity20 victory was pre-ordained			1
instead , @entity55 ’s scratch line - up — decimated by injuries and a personnel shortage caused by fixture congestion — took the fight to the hosts and outplayed them in most areas			2
amid a multitude of exceptional individual performances no 8 @entity63 was a titanic figure , driving his side on to the front foot and deep into enemy territory , while @entity70 was the fulcrum of the back - line threat as he resumed his wrecking - ball routine			1
the @entity74 centre repeatedly blasted gaping holes in the home defence and the fact that he was given the ammunition to do so was testament to the men who had been identified as potential weak links for the tourists			0
circumstances had brought @entity43 and @entity84 together as an untried 10 - 12 axis and the fear was that they would be exposed by the @entity20			1
bombing forward : @entity88 @entity87 makes a break against @entity20 at @entity3 in @entity90 back with a bang : @entity92 is tackled @entity93 on his @entity2 comeback clockwork : @entity2 's @entity96 rises highest to claim the ball from a line - out on the charge : @entity100 makes a break from full back in the first test that doomsday scenario did not come to pass , as the @entity2 pair held firm and caused far more trouble than they were forced to endure			1
@entity43 kicked all his penalties , pulled the strings with real authority and committed body and soul to tackling duties			1
@entity84 , meanwhile , was a revelation — displaying nifty footwork , a willingness to play flat to the line and a knack for sending @entity70 into space with beautifully delayed passes			0
so many others stood out , too , from hooker @entity122 — who made light of a lack of game - time in the last month to turn in a superb shift at hooker — to @entity96 and @entity92			1
at the forefront of the epic effort was @entity87 , who led by stirring example and eclipsed his legendary rival @entity131			0
but the captain was not prepared to accept praise for himself and his team as any sort of compensation for a negative outcome			0
‘ we ’re extremely proud of all the effort that ’s gone in , to come here and do that , but we ca n’t be happy with it , ’ said the @entity139 flanker			0
‘ the standards we set for each other now and the standards we play at ; we ’re coming down here to win a @entity150 series , simple as that			2
‘ we genuinely thought we could win here			2
that ’s the position we have got to with @entity155 rugby			0
but it ’s one thing being in a good place and another thing winning			0
’ @entity87 ’s reaction to this agonising defeat highlighted the fact that @entity2 do not harbour an inferiority complex against the world ’s pre-eminent rugby nation — they are convinced that beating them is within their scope			1
flying winger : @entity2 's @entity167 attempts to beat the tackle of @entity169 ( left ) and @entity170 comeback : @entity172 scored two penalties to put @entity20 back into the lead with ten minutes to go dangerous break : @entity84 charges at the @entity20 defence as @entity2 clear their lines @entity179 ball : @entity20 scrum half @entity181 keeps the @entity20 attack ticking asked what they have to do better in @entity38 next week , the skipper added : ‘ we ’ve just got to win , simple as that			1
we got ourselves in some good positions at times , but did n’t quite finish them off			0
they probably got on our line twice and took a chance			0
’ when it was put to him that the @entity20 will be markedly better in six days , @entity87 said : ‘ yeah , but so will we			2
we know we ’re going to get stronger every week , but we were pretty evenly matched out there			0
’ that , in fact , is understating the @entity155 performance			0
in so many ways , they held the aces until the heartbreaking finale , when @entity29 touched down in the right corner two minutes from time to ensure @entity20 preserved their 20 - year unbeaten record at this venue			1
@entity55 ’s men made mistakes along the way , but they forced so many more from their opponents , whose rustiness was sometimes remarkable to behold			0
rarely has an @entity20 team made so many basic handling errors			2
heavy hitter : @entity2 no 8 @entity63 carries the ball upfield making yards : @entity20 's @entity219 leaves @entity2 's @entity43 lying on the ground late blow : @entity222 is shown a yellow card by referee @entity224 after illegal play at the breakdown late charge : @entity228 made an immediate impact after coming off the bench in the second half until the try at the end , the scoring had come down to a kicking duel , with @entity172 ’s five penalties matched by @entity43 ’ four and one from his replacement , @entity228			1
both sides relied on precise , contestable , in - field kicks to build pressure , but @entity2 had the clear upper hand in the set - piece , with @entity122 and @entity96 orchestrating a lineout masterclass			1
in the final analysis , what counted against @entity2 was that they could not quite capitalise on three or four prime try - scoring opportunities			1
openings were created but the visitors were not clinical enough			0
@entity8 was asked if this was a missed chance to claim an historic victory and he said : ‘ yes , definitely			2
now the game next week is huge for us because we want to tie the series and go to a decider in @entity257 believing we can win it			2
’ @entity2 will step up preparations for the @entity150 in the belief that they have nothing to fear from the world ’s best team			2
several high - class reinforcements are on standby to return and should ensure that intensity levels rise , rather than drop off after this loss			2
this series is not over yet			0
glorious failure need not become a habit			0
powerful : @entity270 of the @entity20 is hauled down by @entity63 and @entity96 deadly touch : veteran centre @entity29 dives over in the corner at @entity3 jubilation : @entity29 is congratulated by team - mate @entity170 after scoring the only try of the match @entity277 effort : @entity63 and @entity84 of @entity2 walk through the tunnel after the final test			1

late try from @entity29 *sealed* *dramatic* victory for @entity20
@entity2 were in front for most of the game thanks to penalties from @entity43
win extends @entity20 's 20 - year unbeaten record at @entity3
@entity228 kicked a late penalty on his return to @entity2 action
