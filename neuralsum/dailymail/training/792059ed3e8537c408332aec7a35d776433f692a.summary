by @entity0 this is the moment two teenage boys threw a defenceless cat over an eight - foot garden fence into the grip of a pair of dogs			1
@entity9 footage shows the thugs walking along a pathway behind homes in @entity13 , @entity14 , before picking up the black and white feline by the neck and hurling her			1

' luckily , the whole incident was all caught on @entity9			0
they fling the defenceless feline over a fence in a pathway behind housing in the @entity14 town ' at first the boys appeared to be stroking the cat just outside the property but then they picked her up by the scruff of the neck and threw her high over the wooden fence and iron gate			1
' we believe these boys threw the cat over the garden boundary with the intention of her being attacked by the @entity64 and @entity65 on the other side			2
' luckily the garden they chose was the cat â€™s home so the dogs were used to the cat and did not see her as an intruder			2
