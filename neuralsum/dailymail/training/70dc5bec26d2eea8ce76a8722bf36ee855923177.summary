their father , @entity27 , right , similarly said his two sons are not to blame for the @entity30 attacks he also said that he believes that his sons were set up , and without going into specifics , he said that if his younger son was killed once he is found , then he would see it as proof that there was a conspiracy afoot			1

' my two sons are really innocent and i know neither of them have never , never talked about what they 're saying about them now , ' she said			1
trying to understand : @entity27 said that he could not believe that his sons were behind the fatal bombing in sync : both @entity27 and his wife , @entity61 , alluded to the existence of a conspiracy involving police or @entity10 meant to frame their innocent sons suspect : @entity4 , now 19 - years - old , is seen in these two pictures that were released by authorities @entity61 described the boys as very communicative and said they called her often , telling her everything that was going on in their lives			1
' i know my son never spoke about those things			1

rather than being upset about his nephew 's death , their uncle @entity180 who lives in @entity182 called @entity3 a ' loser ; and said that he ' deserved ' his death this morning			1
