my heart says it is @entity2 to win this @entity4 final but in my head i have to go for @entity6 , although not by a wide margin			1
the important thing for the event as a whole is that it has got the right final , involving the two best sides			1
i thought @entity13 were the one team who might just have a say but @entity6 were too strong — both these sides fully deserve to be here			1
the reason they have both earned it is that they have played the full - on , modern brand of one - day cricket : powerful batting combined with wicket - taking bowling marshalled by two captains constantly looking to make things happen			1
it is the completely up - to - date version of 50 - over cricket — slightly different to what was seen from certain other teams we could mention			1
@entity33 is relishing the prospect of facing @entity6 in the @entity4 final on sunday @entity35 will hope to make an impact for @entity6 in the @entity4 final everyone likes an underdog , and part of you wants to see the @entity41 win because it would be great to have a new winner			1
they have played exhilarating cricket and you also get the sense that their whole country is really behind them			1
from an @entity53 point of view , they are visiting in early summer and to welcome them as world champions would really add something to it			2
but my head is ruling the heart largely due to the home advantage of @entity6 playing at the @entity63			1
to me that is a massive factor at @entity65			0
the @entity2 have played every match at home so far and i fear that it is going to be difficult to travel to a venue that is going to be quite different to where they have been playing			0
@entity6 celebrate as they book their place in the final with a win over @entity13 in the semi-finals @entity76 thanks the crowd after winning the semi-final against @entity13 the ball has swung around in @entity2 , but , with the drop - in pitch , that has not been so much the case at the @entity63 which , apart from anything else , is much larger than where they have been so far			1
on some of the grounds in @entity2 even the mishits will go for six , and that will not happen this time			0
one of the more notable statistics of this tournament has been that @entity91 has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries , the remarkable @entity95 captain is the most important single figure in this game			2
as a batsman he ’s shown that he is looking to tee off virtually every time			0
@entity2 captain @entity91 has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries he has made some dashing knocks in the earlier rounds without pushing on to a really big score			0
if he could do that in the final it would be huge for @entity2			2
he has been my captain of the tournament			0
he is aggressive without doing anything for show , but he may have to be a little more conservative in his field placings in this match , and how he uses the spin of @entity114 will be key			0
apart from @entity91 i like plenty of cricketers in this @entity2 side , there are lots of tough nuts who are a bit unsung , guys such as @entity114 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
@entity114 will play his last ever odi for @entity2 in the @entity4 final the 100,000 capacity @entity63 will provide a fitting venue for sunday 's showpiece i do not expect them to choke , but i think @entity6 may be building up to a big performance			1
the @entity133 have n’t quite played their best yet and they have been more stop - start , with a game called off and the loss to @entity2			2
that will not have too much bearing in my view , and you have got to be impressed by the firepower that runs through the team — look at those late runs from @entity144 that were so important in the semi-final , for example			2
this could go either way , but home advantage should just tip it for @entity6			0
and it should be good for the neutral .			0

my head and my heart are torn over who should win the @entity4
but the important thing is we have the two best sides in the final
they both deserve it for their full - on modern brand of one - day cricket
we all love an underdog and part of me wants to see the @entity41 win
