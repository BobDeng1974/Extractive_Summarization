he 's the playboy son of the late footballing legend @entity1 and has battled with drug and alcohol addiction in the past			2
but as a suited and booted @entity6 entered the @entity8 house on wednesday night the 33 - year - old looked better than ever			1
but his current dapper image is the result of a new clean - living lifestyle , serious gym time and three hair transplants - now fans wonder if he 'll find love on the reality show			1
despite being a model for @entity33 his personal style left a lot to be desired			2
there were the long - haired years when @entity6 channeled baggy jeans and vests seemingly in homage to @entity40 rap stars			1
then came the era when he when he rocked oversized polo shirts , low - slung trousers and bright white tennis shoes			2
in fact it was n't really until recently that @entity6 started to develop any fashion finesse			1
last year he attempted the hipster look growing an impressively large bushy beard			2
however , he ended up shaving it off after it began to take too long to groom			2
trendy : in recent years @entity6 has moved away from his bad boy image - embraced trendy @entity56 style in his younger years a curly haired @entity6 , a dead ringer for dad @entity1 , was a model for @entity33 @entity6 wears a t - shirt declaring ' brits do it best ' for a campaign for @entity33 he said : ' it turns into a daily grind making sure it is ship shape			1
it needs a lot more maintenance than your head hair and you have the added complication of keeping it clean			2
i feel ten years younger without it			0
' however that was n't before his facial fuzz helped him land a cool advertising deal as the star of a @entity82 campaign in @entity83 in march 2014			0
of course , his new look has n't come easy			0
in fact to get his hair so sleek @entity6 has undergone not one , but three hair transplants after suffering from a receding hairline			1
@entity6 also works hard on his body having previously undergone a ten day bootcamp in @entity91 to get tone himself up			1
in 2003 a young @entity6 was spotted rocking a long pony tale and some rather questionable vests @entity6 's partying ways got him into trouble and in 2007 he declared himself bankrupt a jaded - looking @entity6 wore an ill - fitting suit to the @entity98 and @entity97 in 2006 a friend of @entity6 's said that he 's even started his own line of supplements : ' since changing his partying lifestyle , @entity6 has put everything into his health and fitness			1
' he is at the gym every day and actually personally trains people there as well			0
he eats very healthily and clean			0
' he co-founded a brand of protein supplements called @entity110 which he is passionate about			0
since he embarked on this fitness mission he is so happy mind , body and soul with the results and the reaction from other people has been very rewarding			0
' and he even hopes he can keep his figure in shape in the @entity121 house : ' @entity6 hopes that he can maintain this in the @entity124 house			1
as the house does n't have a gym he sought out advice from his personal trainer , @entity128 - who is working with @entity130 for @entity131 - and has helped him come up with some exercises			1
before the dapper look he is rocking now @entity6 went for a bearded hipster vibe being on the high - profile programme is a way for @entity6 to show how much he has matured since his days as a regular on the @entity56 's party circuit			1
he is the son of @entity1 , who became more famous for his addiction to alcohol than his genius on the pitch towards the end of his life in 2005			0
@entity1 's issues would haunt @entity6 who described how he would feel , ' demonic anger , ' because of his father 's drinking			1
indeed in 2007 his own life started to fall apart as he spiraled out of control , suffering alcohol and drug addiction			0
@entity6 said at the time : ' i ’m a bad boy			1
i go out and get drunk , i get high on cocaine and i do stupid debauched things with the wrong women			0
@entity6 had a string of high - profile love interests such as @entity161 singer @entity160 in 2005 @entity6 and @entity162 starred in a @entity164 advert together and have been romantically linked ' i ’ve been sowing my oats for years , and i ’ve been doing drugs for the past six years			1
i do drink too much and it gets out of control			0
' the drink leads to the coke and the coke leads to debauchery - the wrong people and places			2
when i ’m high i do wild , stupid s * * t. i ’m a red - blooded male and i ’m addicted to sex			2
' i do n’t have to be like @entity178 , but i feel his blood running through my veins			0
i need to sort out my problems before it ’s too late			0
' and sow his oats he did			0
@entity6 enjoyed a number of high - profile relationships and dated @entity187 , @entity188 and was romantically linked to @entity162 and @entity189			1
@entity6 first met @entity187 in @entity56 in 2006 when she was in town to host the @entity191			1
up - front : despite being in the house for less than twenty - four hours , @entity193 was quick to ask @entity6 about his relationship with the much - maligned actress - specifically , if they 're still in touch @entity6 works out regularly and posts pictures of himself in the gym , showing off his tattooed biceps shortly after they separated , @entity6 opened up about how he really felt about their break - up , saying : ‘ she ’s a lovely girl and to be honest i do n’t know why we ended on such bad terms			1
' i have nothing but good things to say about her but for some reason she does n’t like me			0
’ admitting their affair was great fun , when asked if he would like to see @entity187 again while she 's in the @entity28 , he said : ‘ no , we will definitely not be rekindling what we once had			0
’ yet despite appearing on a number of television shows such as @entity221 and having his own show named totally @entity6 he struggled to keep himself afloat			1
in 2013 he declared himself bankrupt			0
he said at the time : ' i can confirm i have made the decision to declare myself bankrupt as a result of being unable to make tax repayments			0
' ' i was blessed to earn a large amount of money at a young age , and mistakes have come with that			0
' it was then that @entity6 decided to turn over a new leaf and has since been working on becoming a new man			1
he 's already declared his desire to find love in the @entity121 house , it remains to be seen whether he 'll gain a new generation of female fans on the @entity243 show			1
@entity6 has admitted that he has never been love but he has had no shortage of lovers			2
