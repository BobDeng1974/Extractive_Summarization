by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:48 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 16 january 2013 @entity3 's claim to be taking a ' tantric ' approach to making policy on @entity6 has made him the star of an hilarious cartoon ridiculing his long - awaited @entity9			1
the infamous team of @entity12 animators from @entity13 show the prime minister in bed working on his much - hyped address , before portraying as unable to hold back a mob of @entity6 at the gates of @entity18			0
in the @entity42 today he was today accused of creating five years of uncertainty which will leave @entity46 ‘ closed for business ’ for investors			0
labour leader @entity48 said the pm had ‘ lost control ’ of the @entity51 party over the issue of @entity6 and thrown investment in the economy into doubt ahead of his big speech on friday in which he will promise to hold a referendum			1
attacking mr @entity3 as a ‘ weak prime minister ’ leading a ‘ divided party ’ , mr @entity48 mocked the @entity51 leader for once warning that his party had to stop ‘ banging on about @entity6 ’			1
the mocking continued in the @entity13 video , which has been circulating in @entity64 all day			0
seeing stars : mr @entity3 is shown being hit about the head with the @entity32 logo a mob of people waving @entity6 flags breaks down the gates the animators have seized on mr @entity3 's bizarre defence for why he had not delivered his speech sooner			1
' this is a tantric approach to policy - making , ' he said last month			0
' it will be even better when it does eventually come			0
' the cartoon shows the pm in bed struggling to formulate his policy , before showing a group waving @entity6 flags breaking down gates to confront him			0
in green overalls , mr @entity3 is shown in the @entity85 trying to stem the tide of leaks about his speech cry baby : with the coalition parties split on the idea of taking on @entity91 , the pm is seen nursing a weeping baby @entity26 it also shows many people voting that @entity46 is ' better of out ' of the @entity32 , but the idea has upset mr @entity26 , the deputy prime minister , who is shown in a baby harness crying his eyes out			1
but the video warns that mr @entity3 risks being sunk by the issue of @entity6 like his predecessors , showing @entity25 in a rowing boat wielding an oar			2
the team have previously made videos about @entity26 , during the 2010 election campaign and @entity108 calling a @entity110 voter a ' bigot '			0
@entity3 dodged a question on whether he thought @entity46 would still be in the @entity32 in five years ' time as @entity110 's @entity48 claimed the prime minister was taking an ' unnecessary gamble ' mr @entity3 is due to deliver his long - awaited speech in @entity41 on friday , when he will set out how he hopes to negotiate for @entity91 to return powers to @entity118 before giving the @entity46 people a vote on accepting the ‘ fresh settlement ’			1
but amid growing signs of chaos in @entity51 ranks , the @entity122 revealed mr @entity3 has agreed @entity51 cabinet ministers would be free to campaign against each other in the referendum , which is unlikely to be held until 2018			1
@entity129 today launched a charm offensive to win over @entity131 , inviting them to @entity133 to brief them on mr @entity3 's plans			1
in the @entity42 , mr @entity48 claimed the reason mr @entity3 had been bounced into making a speech on @entity6 ' is nothing to do with the national interest - it 's because he has lost control of his party '			1
@entity129 has launched a charm offensive to win over @entity145 @entity51 mps ahead of the @entity14 's big speech			1
among those seen leaving @entity133 today were ( left to righ ) @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 mr @entity48 said the uncertainty created by talks about renegotiation and whether a referendum would pave the way for @entity46 to exit @entity6 would hit the economy : ‘ his position appears to be this : an in out referendum now would be de-stabilising but promising one in five years time would be just fine for the country			2
‘ what does that mean ? five years of businesses seeing a “ closed for business ” sign hanging around @entity46			0
’ @entity51 grandee @entity168 had said the policy was an ‘ unnecessary gamble ’ , mr @entity48 added			0
@entity129 is anxious to win over @entity145 @entity51 mps ahead of the @entity9 on friday @entity168 told the @entity171 : ' @entity25 said " never go into a room unless you know how to get out of it			1
" ' to commit to a referendum about a negotiation that has n't begun , on a timescale you can not predict , on an outcome that 's unknown , where @entity46 's appeal as an inward investment market would be the centre of the debate , seems to me like an unnecessary gamble			2
' a group of 100 conservative mps launched a ‘ shopping list ’ of powers they want the @entity46 to reclaim from @entity91			1
the @entity192 group is highlighting powers over home affairs and justice , employment rules , energy and agriculture that it says should be clawed back			1
the mps , who have been working closely with foreign secretary @entity201 and other ministers , suggest threatening to withhold funds from some @entity32 schemes if powers are not returned			0
' many of the proposals are already government policy , some could well become future government or @entity51 policy and some may require further thought , ' mr @entity201 said in a foreword to the report			0
@entity51 mp @entity215 , a leading member of the group , said : ' i think it ’s a bit simple to say we want to return to the @entity221 , i guess if you were to say that our priority is more trade and less of the other stuff , that ’s true			0
' but there are other areas where we can co-operate very happily and constructively with the @entity32 , but what we ’re actually trying to recognize is that the status quo is n’t an option as the eurozone moves towards ever greater fiscal union			0
' but mr @entity3 said he had long disagreed with the former @entity51 deputy pm on the issue of @entity6			1
as many as nine @entity51 cabinet ministers are thought to back a @entity46 exit if significant powers can not be repatriated from @entity91			2
as a result , mr @entity3 has agreed that cabinet ministers will be able to campaign to leave the @entity32 , when he eventually holds a referendum			2
a senior source said : ‘ different ministers and different mps are going to have different points of view which they will want to raise and campaign on			0
’ in the @entity42 , mr @entity3 refused to say whether he thought @entity46 would still be in the @entity32 in five years time , only saying he thought ‘ @entity46 is better off in the @entity32 ’			2
the @entity14 added : ' i think that even the leader of the @entity110 should accept the fact that there is a massive change taking place in @entity6 , a change that is being driven by the changes in the eurozone			0
' frankly , this country faces the choice , and political parties in this country face a choice : do we look at these changes and see what we can do to maximise @entity46 's national interest , and do we consult the public about that , or do we sit back , do nothing and tell the public to go hang ? ' i know where i stand , i know where this party stands , and that 's in the national interest			2
' the clash in the @entity42 came hours after a group of 100 @entity274 launched a shopping list of powers they want to see repatriated			2
the @entity192 group wants powers over home affairs and justice , employment rules , energy and agriculture to be clawed back			1
foreign secretary @entity201 wrote the foreword to the group ’s report , claiming many of the ideas could become @entity51 policy			0
but mr @entity48 said mr @entity201 had flown out of the country to get as far away from mr @entity3 ’s @entity6 speech as possible			1
the prime minister spent the afternoon briefing @entity51 ministers and mps on his plans , in an attempt to prevent a collapse in support in the immediate aftermath of his speech on friday			0
