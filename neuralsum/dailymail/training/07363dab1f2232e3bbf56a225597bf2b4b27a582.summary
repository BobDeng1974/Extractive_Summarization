by @entity0 for @entity1 a mass occupation of @entity4 's financial district will go ahead as protestors threaten ' wave after wave ' of protests in response to @entity11 's decision to block open elections			1
@entity14 's legislature today ruled out allowing open nominations in the inaugural election for @entity4 's leader , saying they would create a ' chaotic society			2
' however , democracy activists in the @entity21 financial hub responded by saying that a long - threatened mass occupation of the heart of the city ' will definitely happen			2
the decision by the legislature 's powerful @entity50 sharpens fears that @entity14 wants to screen candidates for loyalty to the central government and is reneging on its promise to let @entity4 's leader be directly elected by voters , rather than the current committee of mostly pro-beijing tycoons			1
@entity36 , a leader of the @entity61 with @entity63 and @entity64 protest movement , said : ' at this very moment , the path of dialogue has been exhausted			0
' his protestors have vowed to rally at least 10,000 people to paralyze @entity4 's financial district - known as @entity61 - to press demands for genuine democracy			1
the group will launch ' wave after wave of protest action ' in the coming weeks ' until we get to a point when we launch the all - out @entity61 action , ' @entity36 told reporters			2
thousands of people gathered in a park across from @entity4 government headquarters this evening to protest the widely expected announcement , chanting slogans and waving their cellphones			2

' under the @entity11 - imposed guidelines , a maximum of three candidates , each approved by more than half of a 1,200 - member nominating committee , will be put forth to @entity4 's 5 million eligible voters in 2017			1
the public will have no say in choosing candidates , raising fears of what some have termed ' fake democracy			0
' ' these rights come from laws , they do n't come from the sky , ' @entity94 said			0
' many @entity4 people have wasted a lot of time discussing things that are not appropriate and are n't discussing things that are appropriate			0
' making clear that @entity14 leaders intend to tightly control politics in @entity4 , @entity94 emphasized that candidates for the city 's chief executive should be loyal to @entity14 's ruling @entity127			1
' he has to be responsible to @entity4 and to the central government , ' @entity94 said			2
' if @entity4 's chief executive does n't love the country and love the party , then that ca n't work in one country			0
' under the principle of ' one country , two systems , ' @entity4 is granted a high degree of control over its own affairs and civil liberties unseen on the mainland			0
the city has been taken over by protests and pro-beijing counter protests in recent months @entity61 said the plan to block the @entity61 financial district was ' the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice			1
' it said that ' the occupation of @entity61 will definitely happen , ' without specifying a date			0
pro-democracy rally member @entity155 said : ' the decision on the nomination committee is very hypocritical			0
' this is not true universal suffrage , so we can not accept this result			0
we will do whatever we can to fight for what we want			0
' @entity11 's announcement comes after a summer of protests and counter-protests that have gripped @entity4 , including a rally two weeks ago by @entity169 activists to denounce @entity61 as threatening the city 's stability			1
leaders of the movement , pictured addressing a crowd , have said up to 10,000 people will occupy the city centre political tensions spiked in june when @entity14 officials released a policy ' white paper ' declaring that @entity4 's ' high degree of autonomy ... comes solely from the authorization by the central leadership			1
' many read the policy paper as asserting @entity11 's dominance of @entity4 's affairs and hit the streets and the internet in protest			2
@entity61 drew @entity11 's rebuke by organizing an online referendum to bolster support for full democracy that received nearly 800,000 votes			0
also sunday , the incumbent leader of the nearby @entity14 - controlled casino capital of @entity199 , @entity200 , was elected to a second five - year term by a @entity11 - friendly committee even though 95 percent of 8,688 votes cast in a similar referendum were in favor of universal suffrage in 2019 .			1
