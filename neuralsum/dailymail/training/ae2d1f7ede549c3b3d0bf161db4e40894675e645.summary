each week @entity0 gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best @entity5 starting xi of the day			2
saturday saw @entity7 inflict more damage on @entity10 's season , while @entity11 struggled to a 2 - 1 win against @entity11 at @entity13			1
@entity14 was the star man for @entity15 again in a 3 - 0 victory over @entity17 , while @entity18 came from two goals down to rescue a point against @entity21			1
here is our team of the day			0
@entity25 - @entity24 ( @entity17 vs @entity15 ) - 8 @entity26 at the @entity27 conceding three goals may not look good on paper , but had it not been for @entity24 in sublime form between the sticks on saturday @entity15 would have been on for a thrashing against @entity17			1
the @entity35 goalkeeper denied @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 with fine saves to keep the score down on saturday			0
@entity24 may have been beaten three times on saturday but he was in inspired form @entity44 - @entity43 ( @entity7 vs @entity10 ) - 7.5 @entity45 at @entity46 strong in the tackle – upending @entity48 at the cost of a booking – but was purposeful in attack as well , although he was lucky to avoid second yellow			1
@entity43 was extremely energetic as @entity7 outplayed @entity10			2
@entity43 was solid in defence and dangerous going forward as @entity7 beat @entity10 2 - 0 @entity44 - @entity54 ( @entity21 vs @entity18 ) - 7.5 @entity55 at the @entity56 not usually highlighted for his attacking play , but the versatile @entity59 set up @entity60 for @entity21 's first of the afternoon and could have had a goal of his own were it not for a fine save from @entity63			1
@entity54 will just be kicking himself his side let a two - goal lead slip			0
@entity54 had a huge helping hand in the first goal as @entity21 and @entity18 drew 2 - 2 @entity44 - @entity68 ( @entity7 vs @entity10 ) - 7.5 @entity45 at @entity46 no - nonsense defending throughout and kept @entity48 out of the game			1
three wins from three since he came into side			0
impressed alongside @entity43 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity68 was an influential figure for @entity7 and has won all three games since returning to the side @entity44 - @entity77 ( @entity15 vs @entity17 ) - 7 @entity26 at the @entity27 may not have been fully fit but the left - back showed no signs of that on saturday			1
@entity81 may be credited with a goal and an assist but @entity77 was just as influential , bombing forward tirelessly against a dogged @entity17 defence			0
@entity77 was a threat going forward against a tiring @entity17 defence on saturday @entity88 - @entity87 ( @entity11 vs @entity89 ) - 8 @entity90 at @entity13 @entity91 , yet again			1
is n’t handed the plaudits the flair players are for obvious reasons , but there is n’t a better midfielder ahead of a back four in the @entity5			0
@entity87 is the new @entity97 for @entity11 and there is no better holding midfielder in @entity35 @entity88 - @entity100 ( @entity7 vs @entity10 ) - 8.5 @entity45 at @entity46 menacing runs from deep asked questions of @entity103 and it was he who had major say in winning goal			1
immense from first minute to last			0
a man of the match performance			0
@entity100 was a driving force for @entity7 in midfield was the man of the match @entity88 - @entity113 ( @entity21 vs @entity18 ) - 8 @entity55 at the @entity56 credited with the man of the match award as he combined persistent running with a cutting final ball on saturday			2
covered 10.8km from the wing against the @entity18			0
@entity113 worked incredible hard for @entity21 against @entity18 @entity88 - @entity14 ( @entity15 vs @entity17 ) - 8.5 @entity26 at the @entity56 again , it was down to @entity14 to save @entity15			2
it is a story that is becoming all too familiar at the moment — when @entity15 are in a spot of bother , up pops @entity14 — but £ 30 million buys you a talented footballer who is the embodiment of a match - winner			2
@entity14 celebrates the second of his goals as @entity15 beat @entity17 3 - 0 @entity128 ( @entity11 vs @entity89 ) - 8.5 @entity90 at @entity13 absolutely marvellous finish for the first goal , curling an effort with the outside of his foot beyond @entity135 from 18 yards			1
@entity128 scored this stunner to put @entity11 on their way against @entity89 on saturday @entity139 - @entity138 ( @entity89 vs @entity11 ) - 7.5 @entity90 at @entity13 thankless task up there on his own			1
tried his best to ruffle the feathers of @entity143 and @entity144 and linked up nicely in spells			0
excellently - improvised flicked finish for the equaliser			0
@entity138 did so well to work the @entity11 defence on saturday and was rewarded with a goal			2
