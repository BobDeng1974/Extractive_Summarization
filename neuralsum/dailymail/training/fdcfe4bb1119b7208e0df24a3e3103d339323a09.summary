it could mean the end for lightbulbs - and turn any object in your home into a light			1
researchers have revealed lightpaper , a way to print sheets of ' paper ' infused with tiny leds			1
they say it can be applied to walls , and even printed onto other objects - turning anything into a light			1
@entity25 is manufactured by mixing ink and tiny leds together and printing them out on a conductive layer			2
it can even be used as wallpaper @entity25 is manufactured by mixing ink and tiny leds together and printing them out on a conductive layer			2
that object is then sandwiched between two other layers and sealed			0
the tiny diodes are about the size of a red blood cell , and randomly dispersed on the material			1
when current runs through the diodes , they light up			1
the breakthrough has been likened to the emergence of @entity41 , and the firm behind it admits even it is n't sure how it will be used			0
the world 's thinnest light , it is printed and flexible , @entity45 , the firm behind it says			1
' today 's lighting methods require soldering led to circuit boards - now you can just print light on what you want '			1
the firm has shown off wallpaper , car logos and even snowboards with display using the paper built in			0
' with @entity25 it 's more of a platform of light that we do n't even know how it 's going to be used , ' @entity64 @entity63 told @entity68			0
' all we know is that we 're trying to unlock the ability to create light			0
' ' the magical thing about this solution is it 's brighter , it 's thinner , it 's flexible , it 's addressable , and programmable			0
' you can address the sections of the diodes , which is a whole other space when you start thinking about solutions of light that you can address sections of , ' he said			2
' anywhere there is a light , this could replace that			0

team can print sheets of ' paper ' infused with tiny @entity12

can be applied to walls , and even printed onto any shaped object
