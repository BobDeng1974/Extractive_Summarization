by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 23 july 2013 web - users who want to protect their privacy have been switching to a small unheard of search engine in the wake of the ' @entity8 ' revelations			1
@entity9 , the little known @entity10 company , sets itself aside from its giant competitors such as @entity12 and @entity13 , by not sharing any of its clients ' data with searched websites			2
this means no targeted advertising and no skewed search results			1
aside from the reduced ads , this unbiased and private approach to using the internet is appealing to users angered at the news that @entity10 and @entity27 governments ( the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) in the @entity10 and @entity29 in the @entity27 ) , have direct access to the servers of big search engine companies , allowing them to ' watch ' users			1
at just 33 , @entity9 founder and ceo , @entity36 has tapped into a niche market - offering internet users real privacy when searching the world wide web within just two weeks of the @entity28 's operations being leaked by former employee @entity42 , @entity9 's traffic had doubled - from serving 1.7million searches a day , to 3million			1
' we started seeing an increase right when the story broke , before we were covered in the press , ' said @entity36 , founder and ceo , speaking to @entity49			0
entrepreneur mr @entity36 had the idea for the company in 2006 , while taking time out to do a stained - glass making course			0
he had just sold successful start - up @entity53 , similar to @entity55 , for $ 10million ( £ 6.76million ) to @entity56			0
while on the course he realised that the teacher 's ' useful web links ' did not tally up with @entity12 's search results , and realised the extent of the personalised skewing of results per user			2
from there he had the idea to develop a ' better ' search engine , that does not share any user information with any websites whatsoever			1
search data , he told the paper , ' is arguably the most personal data people are entering into anything			2
you 're typing in your problems , your desires			0
it 's not the same as things you post publicly on a social network			0
' @entity9 , named after an @entity10 children 's tag game @entity83 ( though not a metaphor ) , was solo - founded by mr @entity36 in 2008 , in @entity85 , @entity86			2
he self - funded it until 2011 when @entity87 , which also backs @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , and a handful of angel investors , came on board			0
leak impact : it appears to some , privacy really does matter , as @entity9 's user - figures show			2
just two weeks after the june 6 revelations , searchers were up 90 per cent the team has expanded to a few full - time people , many part - time contributors and a bunch of open - source contributors			0
' if you 're wondering how you would turn that into a verb ... duck it ! ' he says on the company website			0
the 33 - year - old ceo , who lives in @entity114 , a suburb of @entity115 , @entity86 , with his wife and two children , explains that when other search engines are used , your search terms are sent to that site you clicked on ; this sharing of information is known as ' search leakage '			2
' for example , when you search for something private , you are sharing that private search not only with your search engine , but also with all the sites that you clicked on ( for that search ) , ' he points out on his website			1
' in addition , when you visit any site , your computer automatically sends information about it to that site ( including your user agent and ip address )			0
this information can often be used to identify you directly			0
' so when you do that private search , not only can those other sites know your search terms , but they can also know that you searched it			0
it is this combination of available information about you that raises privacy concerns , ' he says			0
within two weeks of @entity28 's operations being leaked by former employee @entity42 ( pictured ) , @entity9 's traffic had doubled - from 1.7million searches a day to 3million the company offers a search engine , like @entity12 , but which does not traffic users , which has less spam and clutter , that showcases ' better instant answers ' , and that does not put users in a ' filter bubble ' meaning results are biased towards particular users			1
currently , 50 per cent of @entity9 's users are from the @entity10 , 45 per cent from @entity166 and the remaining 5 per cent from @entity167 ( @entity167 )			2
on june 3 , the company reported it had more than 19million direct queries per month and the zero - click @entity169 gets over 9million queries per day			0
it has partnerships with apps , browsers and distributions that include @entity9 as a search option : browsers , distributions , @entity179 , and @entity180			2
companies can use @entity9 for their site search , and the firm offers an open api for @entity185 based on its open source @entity188 platform			1
speaking on @entity10 radio channel , @entity189 , mr @entity36 said : ' companies like @entity9 have sprung in the last couple years to cater to the growing number of data dodgers			1
' there ’s pent up demand for companies that do not track you , ' he says			0
user feedback on the company website say the search engine reminds them of the early days of using @entity12 ; it 's like an ' honorable search site to complement @entity204 ' ; and other are ' amazed ' that a search engine company is ' doing exactly the right thing '			1
critics of the company remain cautious of the sudden surge in success , however , pointing out that 3million searches per day is just a ' drop in the ocean ' compared with the 13billion searches @entity12 does every day			0
writing on his website , @entity216 , who runs the search engine land site and analyses the industry , said big companies like @entity221 and @entity13 had tried pro-privacy pushes before and failed to generate huge interest			1
user feedback on the company website say the search engine reminds them of the early days of using @entity12 ; it 's like an ' honorable search site to complement @entity204 ' ; and other are ' amazed ' that a search engine company is ' doing exactly the right thing ' other companies have had more success , however , and @entity9 is not the first search engine firm to tap into the pro-privacy market			1
competitors include @entity235 , a @entity237 meta - search engine firm , based in the @entity237 and @entity238			1
it returns private meta - search results from other providers			0
from mid 2006 , the company opted not to include the private details of its users , and in 2009 it launched @entity245 , a similar service taking top @entity12 search results without saving users ' ip addresses or giving personal user data to @entity12			1
together , the company 's search engines serve 4.4 million daily searches			0
@entity254 is another free search engine that is fully decentralized			2
it prides itself on making all users of its search engine network as equal , not storing user search requests and does n't censor content			1
perhaps in the wake of the @entity28 and @entity29 revelations , internet users may think twice about their search engine provider .			1

@entity9 , based in @entity86 , does not share user data with sites
this means fewer advertisements and results that are not skewed for users
firm saw web traffic double in the wake of @entity277 tapping leak
@entity281 search engine one of several companies growing in this arena
