@entity11 of @entity12 , @entity5 , runs a hair salon in @entity14			1
but the 26 - year - old is now fighting with the @entity9 against the militant group whose savagery has shocked the world			1
and although he 's proud to be @entity19 , he says he 's ready to kill any of the estimated 500 @entity19 who have travelled to the region to join the @entity10 insurgency			1
' i have to show the world there is a @entity19 citizen fighting against them , ' mr @entity35 told the @entity41			0
mr @entity35 was born in the @entity9 region , which extends from @entity43 , through @entity44 and @entity7 , and into @entity45 , but moved to @entity19 at the age of 15			1
since returning to the region three weeks ago to fight alongside the @entity29 - the self - defence force of @entity7 's @entity9 - he has taken part in fierce firefights and was among the units that retook the vital @entity51			1
he told the @entity41 's @entity52 he believes @entity10 's militants are mostly young , easily brainwashed and go into battle high on drugs			1
at work at the salon : mr @entity35 was born in the @entity9 region , which extends from @entity43 to @entity45 , but moved to @entity19 at the age of 15 ' what i saw from their eyes is they come to be killed 200 per cent because they are brainwashed they will go straight to heaven , ' said mr @entity35			1
today @entity29 fighters and @entity7 government forces were attempting to recapture two towns in northern @entity7 seized by @entity10 in a lighting advance over the past month			2
the @entity9 forces , backed by @entity34 airpower , took one district near the eastern entrance to @entity77 , 70 miles northeast on @entity78 , the site of weeks of clashes , the sources said			2
@entity7 troops supported by @entity7 fighter planes were advancing towards the nearby town of @entity83 , the security sources said			0
both towns are near the @entity45 border and the semi-autonomous @entity9 region			2
it is not known if mr @entity35 was among the units involved in the fighting			0
but his comments , published today , suggest he would jump at the chance and that he 's in for the long haul			0
' when i saw my @entity9 brothers and sisters being killed by these terrorists i was angry in my heart			1
i could n't stop myself and stay home , ' he said			0
' people say , ' if you have a @entity19 passport why are you doing this ? you could get out			0
' but i am fighting to save people 's lives			0
' the actions of the @entity29 forces have created a quandary for the @entity108			0
in @entity43 , the @entity109 ( @entity110 ) fought a 20 - year insurgency that saw them labelled a terror group by the international community			0
now those same fighters are also crossing the borders into @entity7 and @entity44 where they are now fighting on the same side as the @entity34 and its allies , including @entity43			0
the @entity110 says it played a decisive role in blunting the militants ' sweep through @entity7 , which triggered @entity34 air strikes to halt their advance , and is now lobbying for an end to its terrorist label			0
' this war will continue until we finish off the @entity10 , ' said @entity127 , a @entity110 fighter speaking from a hospital bed in @entity129 , the capital of the @entity9 region in @entity7			1
@entity127 , 33 , was wounded for a third time in the battle to retake the northern @entity7 town of @entity134 from the @entity10 after the militants initially routed the @entity9 autonomous region 's @entity29			1
the first two times he was fighting @entity43 forces , part of a conflict which killed 40,000 people between its beginnings in 1984 with demands for @entity9 independence from @entity43 and a ceasefire in march 2013			1
his role highlights the challenge the @entity110 represents for @entity148 , which still views it as terrorist but feels seriously threatened by the @entity10 , which has seized dozens of its citizens			2
victory : @entity29 fighters walk across @entity51 in northern @entity7 yesterday after they managed to retake the strategically important position from @entity10 militants with the help of the @entity157 thanks to @entity127 and his comrades - in - arms , residents of @entity159 who fled in terror at an onslaught that threatened @entity129 , 40 miles away , are now returning to assess the damage			1
they have already sprayed over graffiti that reads : ' the @entity10 is here to stay '			2
' this is not just about @entity159 : this is about @entity9 , ' said @entity110 commander @entity168 , seated beneath a banner of the group 's jailed leader @entity170 , referring to @entity9 - inhabited land in @entity44 and @entity45 as well as @entity43 and @entity7			1
' @entity10 is a danger to everyone , so we must fight them everywhere '			2
enemy 's enemy : a @entity110 ( @entity110 ) fighter in @entity179 , recently retaken from @entity10 an armed sister group of the @entity181 ( @entity182 ) - has carved out an autonomous zone in @entity44 's northeast , successfully fending off attacks by @entity187 militants who have proclaimed a caliphate straddling the frontier with @entity7			2
when the militants overran peshmerga positions in northwestern @entity7 , @entity182 fighters crossed over from @entity44 and evacuated thousands of minority @entity193 left stranded on a mountain with scant food and water			0
' the @entity110 is our hero , ' said 26 - year - old @entity200 , one of hundreds of @entity193 being trained by @entity182 fighters at several camps inside @entity44 to fight the @entity10			2
@entity110 commanders say guerrillas have been dispatched to the front line in the cities of @entity206 and @entity77 as well			0
they declined to give numbers and fierce fighting makes their statements hard to verify			0
the wounded guerrilla @entity127 said the @entity110 was more organised and disciplined than the @entity29 , and its tactics better suited to fighting @entity10 , even without the kind of military hardware @entity214 are seeking			1
' this is how we fought the @entity43 army for years , ' @entity127 said			0
' @entity217 is an act of faith ' .			0
