by @entity1 reporter published : 14:41 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 17:38 est , 22 january 2014 the long - awaited @entity4 premier of @entity6 ’s unrated film @entity5 came unexpectedly on tuesday night in a secret @entity7			1
nearly 300 attendees packed into the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 despite having no clue they were about to watch the much hyped and sex - filled movie , which features actor @entity14 and has been likened to soft core pornography			1
while the film had viewers entranced for much of its two - hour run time , it also elicited at least one bout of unintended laughter			1
whether or not they ’d heard the rumors that tuesday ’s secret screening would feature the nsfw film , viewers sat through two hours of what reviewers elsewhere in the world have described as constant nudity and explicit acts that somehow amount to an ' utterly fascinating ' , ' intellectual ' and ' philosophically rigorous ' film			1
intellectual except , perhaps , for a poorly timed or overly dramatic line uttered by @entity54 that compared the @entity14 character ’s first sexual encounter with the @entity57 , the film ’s heroine , to the fibonacci sequence			1
‘ this is what made people laugh , ’ writes @entity60 of the @entity61			0
but the film ‘ has an unexpectedly straightforward and surprisingly ( if not always intentionally ) comedic undertone			0
’ otherwise , most in attendance agree that shock and awe are two words that aptly describe the accidental audience			0
those attendees , however , did not include director @entity6 or any of the other cast members			2
@entity6 ’s excuse is that he has a lifelong and widely reported fear of flying and has never been to the @entity35			2
audiences were coaxed into @entity10 's @entity76 with no knowledge of what movie they 'd been shown as for @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and the rest , it remains unclear why they shied away from the premier			1
the film follows the story of @entity57 , who retells the story of her life to an older bachelor after she is found beaten in an alleyway			0
@entity14 plays @entity93 , a slightly creepy womaniser , who has his eye on @entity95 , who plays the younger @entity57			0
the first half of the film , which opens in the @entity35 on march 21 , is apparently much less explicit than the second			0
surprisingly unsexy : @entity14 plays one of the hundreds of sexual partners of sex addict @entity57 , played by newcomer @entity95 ‘ @entity14 actually keeps his clothes on most of the time ( the teaser to ‘ @entity104 ’ suggests otherwise ) and is somewhat curiously seen by @entity57 as some kind of romantic ideal , ’ @entity60 writes			2
@entity106 1 opened in @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 back in december			0
the second half — for which @entity14 evidently had to send photos of his male anatomy prior to being cast — opens april 18			0
explicit : the film revolves around heroine @entity57 , played by @entity80 and @entity95 at different ages , and largery focuses on her sexual emploits @entity119 actually keeps his clothes on most of the time ( the teaser to ¿ @entity104 ¿ suggests otherwise ) and is somewhat curiously seen by @entity57 as some kind of romantic ideal , ¿ says the @entity61 ' @entity60			1

volume i of the long anticipated @entity6 film *starring* @entity14 had its @entity4 unveiling in @entity10 , @entity11 on tuesday night
at least one dramatic line in the film received *snickers* from the high brow audience , but the *280* attendees sat ' *enraptured* ' though the 2 - hour
the film remains unrated *due* to explicit sex scenes and also stars @entity80 , @entity136 and @entity81 and @entity82
