@entity94 ( pictured ) disappeared on march 9 in the @entity96 postcode area ' i took her to the vet and they said she could have been run over but she could have also been kicked , it 's a really scary thought			0
' @entity77 , 37 , lost two of her four cats at the beginning of september and is convinced somebody is stealing the animals			2
the mother - of - three said her pets were ‘ very homely ’ and it was more than a coincidence that @entity83 , six , and @entity85 , two , had disappeared at exactly the same time			2
the teaching assistant added : ‘ they both went off on the same day and did n't return			0
it was only when i went on the @entity51 group that i realised so many had disappeared			1
‘ it is strange because they are very homely cats but it made sense when i heard that somebody had been taking them			0
' part - time nanny @entity121 , 50 , who founded the group , said many pet owners she spoke to were now so frightened they did not want to let their cats outdoors			1
' i believe someone is harming them and whoever is doing this needs to get some psychiatric help ' , she said			0

@entity169 , the co-ordinator of @entity171 ’s @entity9 branch , said : ' we hear of cases of cats going missing or being mistreated from time to time but to hear of this number of cats going missing in such a short space of time is astonishing			1
' it must be completely heart - breaking for the owners concerned to have lost their beloved pets and , in some cases , not know what has become of them			2
' it is also horrific to hear that some of these cats have returned with such serious injuries that they have had to be put to sleep			0
' @entity9 mayor @entity189 said : ' i share the devastation any cat owner feels when their much - loved pet goes missing or is injured or killed			1
