' bonkers ' : @entity1 has dismissed accusations of homophobia after using the term ' queer street ' the @entity5 's business editor @entity1 has dismissed homophobia claims against him as ' bonkers ' , after he used the term ' @entity9 '			1
mr @entity1 used the term on his blog to describe the @entity13 financial crisis			2
he also posted a link to the blog on his @entity17 account , where he has 95,000 followers			2
in praising the @entity20 's handling of the situation , he wrote : ' the @entity22 , has taken a reassuringly long - term approach to managing the @entity20 government 's debts - and without its prudence , we might all be in @entity9 or @entity28 by now			1
' however , mr @entity1 was criticised soon after as people accused him of homophobia over the use of the word ' queer ' , which has long been used as an insult against the gay community			0
one tweet from follower @entity37 , said : ' tsk tsk mr p , not quite homophobic but a bit homo - frowny '			1
two hours later mr @entity1 was moved to comment on the row and dispatched another tweet			0
it read : ' some of you seem to think my use of the phrase " @entity9 " is in some way homophobic			1
' the tweet included a link to the @entity51 detailing the origin of the term @entity9			1
while @entity1 was criticisied in some quarters , he has been robustly defended in others			0
the offending phrase : the term ' queer street ' was used in the final paragraph of his original blog post hitting back : mr @entity1 's response to the accusations of homophobia one of his followers , @entity66 , lamented the @entity17 criticism : ' if there were more reflection and less reaction , this country would n't be in this state			2
' but mr @entity1 , who is married to novelist @entity73 , was also defended by the gay rights campaigner @entity74			0
he said the row was an over-reaction because the @entity5 reporter had not meant the word to be derogatory			0
' people are being oversensitive , i appreciate their good intentions but he was nâ€™t using it in a gay put - down sense , ' he told @entity84 , ' the etymology of the word " queer " as @entity1 used it has nothing to do with homosexuality			0
' while the origins of the term are debated , ' @entity9 ' is generally associated with a place of financial difficulty one of the various explanations of its etymology is that it is a distortion of @entity98 in @entity99 , which was once associated with debtors ' courts .			1

' some of you seem to think my use of the phrase " @entity9 " is in some way homophobic . bonkers '
