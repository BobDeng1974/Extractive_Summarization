@entity2 named the new vessel ‘ @entity8 ’ during a lavish ceremony at @entity4 in june when she cut a rope that saw a bottle of champagne being smashed against its hull			1
but today the ship cut a sad figure as it limped towards @entity21 just a week into a twelve day £ 1,200 cruise carrying more than 3,000 passengers who had originally left from @entity24 on september 15			1
passengers are expected to stay on the ship until tuesday night and then disembark on wednesday morning as arrangements are currently being made for them to be flown home to a variety of destinations			1
today one passenger on the ill - fated cruise told the @entity33 that problems began on saturday afternoon when crew members were unable to lift the anchor in at the @entity38 island of @entity39			1
‘ we were stranded there for about four hours until they sorted that out , ’ she said			2
‘ we were told they had eventually repaired and then restarted the motor of the anchor winch			0
‘ then on sunday afternoon the engines just completely stopped which meant many of the lights and lifts did not work for long periods and the air conditioning also failed			0
‘ i have to add that the crew have been amazing and the restaurant staff have done everything they can to feed people			0
i think there are some emergency generators on board which have helped			0
' today @entity7 who are owned by the @entity62 - but who operate the royal princess - confirmed there had been a problem with their vessel and promised passengers a full refund and a 25 per cent discount of any future cruise they wish to book			1
the royal princess is the world ’s sixth largest passenger ship and weighs in at 141,000 tons			1
the vessel was built in @entity75 and is 1,083 feet long and 217 feet high			1
it has 17 decks and a top speed on 22 knots			0
@entity80 : the ship is the world 's sixth largest passenger ship , at 217 feet high with 17 decks opulent : the company named @entity2 ' godmother ' of the ship which has a gold - themed atrium off the deck carnival confirmed a ‘ power outage ’ but said power had been restored to the ship which was on its way to @entity21 , and added : ‘ during the power outrage an emergency back - up generator was used to provide essential services such as toilets			1
the captain has been keeping passengers regularly informed about the situation			2
there are currently 3,594 passengers and 1,336 crew on board			2
’ the latest problem for the ship comes after @entity92 had problems with engine room fires on their vessels @entity113 and @entity114 which saw both ships having to be towed back to @entity117 ports			2
in february the @entity114 had a fire in the engine room which resulted in a loss of power and propulsion			0
there were no casualties or injuries to passengers or crew			2
that came after an incident in november 2010 when on the second day of a voyage from @entity131 to the @entity132 the cruise liner also suffered an engine room fire which cut all electrical power			1
the duchess was heavily pregnant when she cut the ribbon of what was said to be one of the greatest ships elaborate prototype images showed high - powered lighting and a dream swimming pool scene in the sunset today one passenger on the @entity8 posted on a @entity147 page : ‘ the ship had many other problems in the past eight days - plumbing , electrical , air - conditioning and we were delayed leaving @entity39 for over four hours because they could n’t get the anchor up			1
’ another posted a message on the princess cruise facebook page which read : ‘ my friends who are currently on board and texting me are not painting as rosy a picture			0
they said limited power , major repair work required , ship underway max 10 knots , and just got stuck in an elevator when power failed after the power was restored			0
’ the problems for the ship come after @entity92 boasted how the launch ritual involving the @entity2 marked ‘ the birth of a vessel , and asks for a blessing of good fortune and safety for the ship and its passengers and crew			1
’ the company added that the most ‘ important element of the naming tradition is the godmother selected to christen a ship			0
‘ in the mid- 19th century it became customary for a woman of distinction to be selected for this honour			0
a godmother is the symbolic patron , or sponsor , of the ship through its entire life and symbolizes the spirit of the vessel			0
’ previous ‘ godmothers ’ for @entity7 vessel have included the late @entity193 - who named the first @entity8 in 1984 - along with @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			2
today passengers complained about their ordeal on @entity147 after their trip was cut short by five days following the ship ’s maiden voyage to @entity205 on june 16 the @entity8 had conducted a further nine cruises this summer and was due to begin visits to the @entity209 later this year			1
this evening a statement from @entity7 said : ‘ passengers will be provided with a full refund of their cruise fare , along with a 25 per cent future cruise credit			0
princess is making homeward air arrangements for passengers			2
‘ we have dispatched a care team to @entity21 to ensure that all our passengers are provided with any assistance they may require			0
‘ the impact of the repairs on the next royal princess cruise , scheduled to depart from @entity205 on september 27 , is not yet known and we will keep passengers fully advised as details become known			1
once again , we are deeply sorry for this unanticipated disruption of our passengers ’ holiday plans , and we appreciate their patience and understanding of these circumstances			0
