mother - of two @entity7 offers manicures , pedicures , face pack treatments , hair curling and make - up lessons she said : ' i think some girls would relish a break from the traditional bouncy castle party , or a party at a fast food restaurant that every child has			1
' when i was young , i always used to sneak into my mum 's room and try on her make - up , because i looked up to her and wanted to be pretty like her			2
' i know when i was a little girl , i would have been thrilled if my mum had booked me a pamper party			0
' i ca n't wait until my eight - month - old daughter is old enough to have a pamper party herself			0
' no one ever taught me how to put make - up on , and i think that 's something which many girls never get told how to do today			2
' that 's why when you go into town , you often see so many teenagers with their faces plastered in foundation or fake tan , but all they need is a bit of guidance as how to use the products they will use regardless , in moderation and properly			0

providing pamper parties for girls aged seven and above , treatments on offer include manicures , pedicures , face pack treatments , hair curling and make - up lessons			1

' the issue of putting make up on children can prove a sticky issue among parents			0
little children will always love raiding the dressing up box and playing around with mum 's make - up , but there is growing concern over the ' hyper - sexualisation ' of young girls			2
there is a growing trend in @entity103 for not only children 's pamper parties but also @entity107 - style beauty pageants - which sometimes accept newborn contestants			1
the @entity110 government last month moved to protect young girls from potential dangers by banning such pageants and even threatening organisers with years in prison and fines			0
while @entity7 says that she 's aware of these disturbing competitions , she insists her parties are all just about having fun			1
she will provide two main types of parties , those for children aged around 7 - 11 and parties for teenagers from the ages of 12 and above			2
@entity128 admires her look in a mirror after her makeover at a @entity10 pamper party at the younger children 's parties , girls will be able to try on sparkly make - up and colourful nail varnishes			1
for the parties aimed at teenagers , the emphasis will be on looking beautiful without using too much make - up			2
she says : ' i plan to teach children how to look after their skin and apply cosmetic products correctly			0
' @entity7 prides herself on using high - quality , hypoallergenic products and says parental permission for all children receiving treatments will be sought			1
she said : ' children love dressing up and looking pretty , and what i plan to offer is something different and alternative to simply going to a party and getting their face painted			2
' the creative beautician has always enjoyed party organising and said her pamper parties will involve more than just the girls getting a treatment			0
