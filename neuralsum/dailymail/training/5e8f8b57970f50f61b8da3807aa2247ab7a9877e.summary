retired teacher @entity8 , 74 , suffered such appalling and undignified treatment she was left sobbing in her hospital bed with a broken hip by staff who told her husband @entity14 is what old people do '			1
during her treatment at two different hospitals @entity19 , 74 , had fallen over four times times after being forced to use a bedside cabinet as a walking aid			1
retired teacher @entity8 , 74 , suffered such appalling and undignified treatment she was left sobbing in her hospital bed with a broken hip ms @entity8 with one of her grandchildren			1
her husband says the treatment she received was so appalling , she was left sobbing in her hospital bed yet doctors failed to notice the fracture and put her back in bed			1
they also left the dementia sufferer wincing in further pain by forcing her to endure a course of physiotherapy - not realising the extent of the breakage			1
eventually doctors reassessed mrs @entity8 , a housewife of @entity37 after her husband of 47 years demanded further tests and an x-ray revealed the fracture			1
but she suffered further indignities before she eventually passed away in the @entity43 last december			1
today mr @entity19 , 67 , a retired teacher who has made an official complaint against @entity45 said : ' i have grown up with the @entity4 and in the old days you respected doctors like policemen			1
' they had standing in the community but now i do n't think they are much better than witch doctors			2
it is all about money			2
' a doctor should not be saying to me " my best guess is " - that is not good enough for a man who has a medical degree			2
@entity8 and @entity14 in happier times			1
@entity8 leaves behind three children and five grandchildren had spent two years in and out of hospital following a series of strokes in 2010 during her treatment at two different hospitals @entity19 , 74 , had fallen over four times after being forced to use a bedside cabinet as a walking aid ' in my wife 's case they seemed to be working on guesses			1
she kept saying to me " please do not send me back to the hospital " , but i had to			1
' i do blame myself			2
she was cheated out of her dignity and was catastrophically let down			2
' it has been tear - jerking seeing my wife of almost 50 years like that , and these are the last memories i have of her			2
' i have a mix of anger and regret , all while trying to grieve , and i just keep wondering how i could have prevented it			2
she was strong , strong as an ox is and i 'm lost without her			2
' mrs @entity88 , who leaves three children and five grandchildren , had spent two years in and out of hospital following a series of strokes in 2010			1
she was initially admitted to @entity43 but was transferred to @entity43 where she suffered her first fall in september 2011			2
mr @entity19 says he no longer trusts the @entity4 after the ' disgusting ' way his wife was treated the trust has apologised to mr @entity19 , who said : ' @entity8 was cheated out of her dignity and was catastrophically let down			1
it was tear - jerking seeing my wife of almost 50 years like that ' mr @entity19 added : ' she had no @entity103 frame and had to use the bedside cabinet - which is on wheels			1
but where were the nurses ? they must have seen her struggling			2
' then when she was sent to @entity109 , there were three more falls over the next week			0
one could be an accident , two unfortunate , three carelessness ... but four ? that is just gross negligence			0
' when i went in she was very agitated and she screamed when i touched her knee			0
but when i told the nurses that she was in pain , they disagreed , saying : " no she 's not - she 's an old lady [ and ] they do it because they can " and " crying is what old people do "			1
' she had been in pain for six days but obviously she could n't tell them because she could n't talk [ because of the stroke ]			1
i kept pushing for help and eventually a doctor got an x-ray done and she was found to have a broken hip from the fall			1
' if that 's not ringing alarm bells , then that 's just not right			0
it 's all about ticking boxes and not taking notice of the patients			0
' mrs @entity8 suffered further indignities during her hospital stay before she eventually passed away last december mrs @entity8 eventually passed away in the @entity43 last december during her time in hospital , mr @entity19 said his wife , who had early dementia , was left in a nightdress soaked in her own human waste and at other times was left completely naked			1
she passed away on december 6 , 2012			0
he added : ' at @entity43 she was sat in a chair paddling in her own waste			0
she was wearing a nightgown with nothing underneath			0
how could the nurses let that happen ? ' you would n't even treat animals like she was treated			0
i had to sit and watch my wife crying			1
' another time a nurse told me : " i caught your wife eating with her fingers "			0
i told her the fact she 'd sat there and watched her unable to use the utensils - when she was meant to be helping her - was a disgrace			0
' i can tell that the nurses are frustrated but they can not speak out because they are worried about getting sacked			0
i do not trust the @entity4 any more			0
' what was particularly insulting was on the day of her funeral i received a letter from the @entity4 about how they planned to carry on treating her			0
the letter was even dated after her death			0
i just do n't know how this can be happening in this day and age			0
' there has been a catalogue of errors and it 's disgusting			0
' in a letter to mr @entity19 , @entity184 associate director of patient safety and governance , @entity19 , said : ' i wish to reiterate the very sincere apologies given to you by the matrons to whom you described your wife 's experiences			0
' the experiences you described are not acceptable and are not to the standard of care expected within @entity45			0
' there is very specific guidance relating to these aspects of care including very clear guidance on the use of clothing items for physically vulnerable adults which has been distributed widely within the @entity45			0
' i am extremely sorry that this was not always followed			0
