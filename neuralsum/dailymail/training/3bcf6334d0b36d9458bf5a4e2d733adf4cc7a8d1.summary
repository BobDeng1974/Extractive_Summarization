some witnesses said @entity1 had been shot in the back			1
another said he was face - down on the ground when officer @entity6 finished him off			0
still others acknowledged changing their stories to fit published details about the autopsy or admitted that they did not see the shooting at all			2
a review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made during the shooting investigation that were inconsistent , fabricated or provably wrong			1
prosecutors exposed these inconsistencies before the jurors , which likely influenced their decision not to indict @entity6 in @entity1 's death			2
@entity34 , the @entity35 prosecutor , said the grand jury had to weigh testimony that conflicted with physical evidence and conflicting statements by witnesses as it decided whether @entity6 should face charges			1
' many witnesses to the shooting of @entity1 made statements inconsistent with other statements they made and also conflicting with the physical evidence			1
some were completely refuted by the physical evidence , ' @entity34 said			0
the decision on monday not to charge @entity6 with any crime set off more violent protests in the @entity51 suburb of @entity52 and around the country , fueled by claims that the unarmed black 18 - year - old was shot while surrendering to the white officer in the mostly @entity58 city			0
what people thought were facts about the august 9 shooting have become intertwined with what many see as abuses of power and racial inequality in @entity67			0
in a clip played for the grand jury , @entity70 , right , said that officer @entity6 had fired at least one shot at his friend while @entity1 was running away - something which the autopsies showed not to be true			1
@entity70 is pictured above with his attorney @entity76 ( left ) and media coverage of the shooting 's aftermath made it into the grand jury proceedings			1
before some witnesses testified , prosecutors showed jurors clips of the same people making statements on tv			2
their inconsistencies began almost immediately after the shooting , from people in the neighborhood , the friend walking with @entity1 during the encounter and even one woman who authorities suggested probably was n't even at the scene at the time			1
jurors also were presented with dueling versions from @entity6 and @entity70 , who was walking with @entity1 during the aug. 9 confrontation			2
@entity70 painted @entity6 as provoking the violence , while @entity6 said @entity1 was the aggressor			2
but @entity70 also declared on tv , in a clip played for the grand jury , that @entity6 fired at least one shot at his friend while @entity1 was running away : ' it struck my friend in the back			1
' one woman testified that she saw @entity1 leaning through officer @entity6 's car window - but then admitted she suffers from mental disorder , has racist views and trouble distinguishing the truth from things she had read online @entity70 held to a variation of this description in his grand jury testimony , saying the shot caused @entity1 's body to ' do like a jerking movement , not to where it looked like he got hit in his back , but i knew , it maybe could have grazed him , but he definitely made a jerking movement			1
' other eyewitness accounts also were clearly wrong			0
one woman , who said she was smoking a cigarette with a friend nearby , claimed she saw a second police officer in the passenger seat of @entity6 's vehicle			0
when quizzed by a prosecutor , she elaborated : the officer was white , ' middle age or young ' and in uniform			0
she said she was positive there was a second officer - even though there was not			0
another woman testified that she saw @entity1 leaning through the officer 's window ' from his navel up , ' with his hand moving up and down , as if he were punching the officer			2
but when the same witness returned to testify again on another day , she said she suffers from mental disorder , has racist views and that she has trouble distinguishing the truth from things she had read online			1
one witness told a federal investigator that he saw an officer with a gun drawn and @entity1 ' on his knees with his hands in the air ' before later admitting he had n't seen the shooting prosecutors suggested the woman had fabricated the entire incident and was not even at the scene the day of the shooting			1
another witness had told the @entity164 after the shooting that he saw @entity6 shoot @entity1 in the back and then stand over his prone body to finish him off			1
but in his grand jury testimony , this witness , acknowledged that he had not seen that part of the shooting , and that what he told the @entity164 was ' based on me being where i 'm from , and that can be the only assumption that i have			1
' the witness , who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood where @entity1 was killed , also acknowledged that he changed his story to fit details of the autopsy that he had learned about on tv			2
' so it was after you learned that the things you said you saw could n't have happened that way , then you changed your story about what you seen ? ' a prosecutor asserted			0
' yeah , to coincide with what really happened , ' the witness replied			0
another man , describing himself as a friend of @entity1 's , told a federal investigator that he heard the first gunshot , looked out his window and saw an officer with a gun drawn and @entity197 ' on his knees with his hands in the air			1
' he added : ' i seen him shoot him in the head			0
' but when later pressed by the investigator , the friend said he had not seen the actual shooting because he was walking down the stairs at the time and instead had heard details from someone in the apartment complex			0
' what you are saying you saw is n't forensically possible based on the evidence , ' the investigator told the friend			0
shortly after that , the friend asked if he could leave			0
' i ai n't feeling comfortable , ' he said .			0
