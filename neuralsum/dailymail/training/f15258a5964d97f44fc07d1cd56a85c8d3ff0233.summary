i hate the loan system			1
this window has seen some bizarre deals – loans with a view to a permanent signing , loans with an obligation to sign permanently , a two - year loan deal , loans between @entity12 clubs , and loans with the club sending the player out still paying his wages			1
supporting a club is belonging to a club , being part of a club			0
the team representing that club goes on to the field and can generate passions and memories that very few other things in life can bring			0
i do n’t expect the players to have the same love and support for a club that the fans have			1
but i do expect commitment for all the time they are there			0
@entity41 signed two players on loan on deadline day – @entity40 from @entity42 , and @entity45 from @entity47			1
i ’ve no reason to doubt they will both put in 100 per cent when asked to play for their ‘ temporary ’ club			1
but ultimately these players do n’t belong to @entity41			1
they ’re not as committed to the club , because they do n’t belong there			0
the same applies to all loans , although the bizarre nature of @entity37 ’s ‘ loan ’ switch from @entity72 to @entity73 is a bit different			1
he ’s joined on loan , but at the end of his year - long stay back in @entity81 , @entity73 are obliged to buy him from @entity72			1
heading to @entity81 : @entity37 has joined @entity73 on loan who then have an obligation to buy so why not just buy him now ? and what ’s to stop @entity73 carrying out their obligation of signing him permanently next summer , but then immediately selling him on to a @entity12 club , possibly one of @entity72 ’s rivals ? in this case , the commitment of @entity73 to the player is questionable			1
players loaned between @entity12 clubs simply should n’t be allowed			1
the only exceptions should be under 21s – loan moves for @entity102 , @entity103 and , long before that , @entity98 proved fruitful			2
but on deadline day @entity105 , an international who set up @entity109 ’s winning goal against @entity110 to take them through the group stage in @entity112 , a player who was @entity115 ’s record signing only two years ago , a ‘ statement ’ signing after the club ’s fantastic rise from the depths of @entity122 back to the @entity12 , joined top - flight rivals @entity116 on a season - long loan			1
to @entity116 and back : @entity109 international @entity105 has left @entity115 for @entity116 on loan it ’s a clever move from @entity125 – his record signing @entity127 was also at the @entity128 with @entity109			2
the £ 9.5million striker might settle in quicker with a familiar face close by			0
having lived in @entity116 i can see where @entity125 is coming from with that thinking			0
but one @entity12 club borrowing a @entity128 player from another @entity12 club is just wrong			1
if you want him – buy him			0
if you ca n’t afford to buy him , then do n’t buy him			0
loans like these can sometimes depend on which managers or chairmen are friendly with each other – this is n’t how football should work			0
try before you buy : @entity148 signed a year - long loan deal at @entity150 from @entity151 @entity152 completes @entity154 loan deal reports suggest that @entity156 is on loan to @entity158 with @entity150 playing his wages in total during the year long spell			1
so in effect , @entity150 are part - funding @entity158 ’s @entity164 games against @entity165 in the group stage			0
funding promotion : @entity168 joined @entity150 before being loaned back to @entity169 when @entity150 signed @entity168 18 months ago , they immediately loaned him back to the @entity172 club , and @entity169 became the first club in second tier history to have a £ 15m @entity150 player help them secure promotion			0
completely unfair on the rest of the challengers who missed out			2
in effect , @entity150 paid for @entity169 ’s promotion because there was no way they would have gone up without @entity183			0
some loans are understandable – @entity148 ’s serious injury that forced him to miss the @entity128 would be enough to make any club want to ‘ try before they buy			0
’ a serious glut of injuries , or the sudden departure of a key player , might also lead to loan moves			2
some temporary transfers are understandable , but generally i ’m not in favour of loans			2
especially this one - the most bizarre loan i ’ve ever known			2
@entity199 ’s move from @entity200 to @entity42 in this window			0
it ’s a two - year loan deal for a 20 - year - old full - back			2
after the first year , @entity200 can pay a fee to effectively buy him out of his loan and take him back to @entity81			2
if that happens @entity42 are developing a player and getting absolutely no financial , long - term or significant short - term benefit from the deal			0
but @entity42 do have the option to buy if @entity199 stays the full two years			0
this is not a club who have found themselves in the @entity12 and need a significant amount of help to even survive			1
for me , @entity42 are bigger than loan deals , and certainly bigger than taking a player from @entity200 who they will have to keep for two years before they can call him their own .			1

the loan system must be *re-addressed* because it is getting out of hand
temporary deals between @entity12 clubs must be *banned*
big clubs loaning players but still playing wages creates an unfair *advantage*
