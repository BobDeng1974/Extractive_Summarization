the mere prospect of cash can make unethical behavior much more likely , found a study released last month			1
researchers from the @entity5 and @entity6 wanted to find out exactly what kind of effect the promise of money had on people 's behavior			1
the study found that when people stood to gain financially , they were much more likely to behave unethically than otherwise			1
the price of ethics : the study found that people behave more unethically when they stand to gain financially , especially in the realm of business ' we were interested in why good people would do bad behavior , ' @entity22 , a management professor and co-author of the study told @entity28			1
@entity29 of the @entity5 and @entity30 of @entity6 used 324 university students for the study			1
the group was broken into two groups and took part in the same exercises - only one group was offered a financial reward for certain behavior , and the other was n't			0
in one exercise , the students were presented with unethical acts and asked how likely they were to engage in the acts - one group for money , and one group for nothing			1
in another , they played a ' deception game , ' in which one group could earn more money by lying rather than telling the truth , and the other would gain nothing from the lies			1
a third game allowed the students to choose to hire an employee who would share insider information if hired , and for the second group the candidate had no inside knowledge			0
greed is good : @entity66 's mantra rings true for a lot of top executives in the business world in the fourth game , students engaged in a performance task in which they could earn money by being dishonest ( there was nothing to gain by being dishonest for the second group )			2
the study found that people given an opportunity for financial gain were much more likely to be unethical in their intentions , decisions and behavior than those who were n't			1
a sample scenario is : ' you work as an office assistant for a department at a @entity5			2
you ’re alone in the office making copies and realize you ’re out of copy paper at home			0
you therefore slip a ream of paper into your backpack			0
' ' the study did n't ask people to do horrible acts , there were more mundane like stealing office supplies , ' @entity22 told @entity28			2
@entity100 hard cash : it 's been said that money corrupts , but the latest study shows the mere thought of it is enough to prompt unethical behavior ' but it just shows how insidious this can be			1
these were normal people and this is something we can all be affected by , ' she said			0
@entity22 said that when it comes to making a business decision , study participants with the promise of money set aside their moral issues across the board			1
it 's this kind of behavior we 've seen often in the downfall of major corporations : white collar crimes that begin with a small ethical misstep and snowball into huge acts of fraud			0
in recent years , we 've seen huge corporations such as @entity131 and @entity133 collapse due to fraud , and @entity135 who defrauded investors of almost $ 65 billion			0
@entity22 said that when participants in the study had an opportunity for financial gain , they became single - minded in the pursuance of it			2
' they completely lost track of everything else except pursuing their self interests , ' @entity22 told @entity28			1
' they focused on the cost benefit of their decisions rather than how it might affect other people			0
' cashing in : study participants set aside all moral questions when making business decisions that would bring in more money the study is just the latest in a series of academic studies that show that money corrupts			1
one 2012 study by the @entity163 showed that ' upper class individuals behave more unethically that lower - class individuals ' , which researchers said showed a more favorable attitude towards greed			0
the findings show that ' the mere presence of money ... can serve as a prompt for immoral behavior operating through a business decision frame , ' the study notes			2
' these findings suggest that money is a more insidious corrupting factor than previously appreciated , as mere , subtle exposure to money can be a corrupting influence , ' it concludes			0
' the next question is how business decisions can be framed so that money wo n't be corrupting , ' said @entity22 to @entity28			2
' we 're looking into that			0
we hope there 's a positive story out there			0

researchers from @entity6 and @entity5 found that the mere promise of money is enough to cause people to make unethical decisions
results of the study found people would engage in insider *trading* and lying if they stood to gain financially , but they would n't if there was no money involved
participants ' completely lost track of everything ' in the effort of pursuing cash
