it was the first fatal bombing in the capital in nearly a decade of an apparently political nature and it traumatized a capital that two decades before had been ravaged by car bombs set by drug traffickers fighting extradition to the @entity49			1
@entity7 's police chief , gen. @entity50 , blamed the country 's main leftist rebel group , the @entity51 , or @entity51 , though without offering any evidence			1

' he has also been critical of @entity54 for allegedly being soft on the rebels , who have stepped up attacks in recent months			2
under @entity103 , @entity11 's @entity49 - backed military succeeded in diminishing the @entity51 's numbers by roughly half to about 9,000 currently , with increasingly effective bombings that prompted record desertions			0
@entity11 's capital became progressively safer , the conflict increasingly limited to less populated hinterlands			0

earlier tuesday , police said they had deactivated a car bomb , a @entity195 9 whose trunk contained the explosive indugel , in the center of the city			2
@entity54 said its target was apparently a police station in a neighborhood named for his great uncle , former president @entity205			1
the driver , who was arrested , ' made a series of confessions , ' he said , indicating the @entity51 was to blame			0
@entity54 considers himself a progressive and , in addition to a military hard line against the @entity51 , has sought to return stolen land to peasants and pay reparations to victims of @entity11 's long - running civil conflict			2

' i see a clear intent to destabilize , ' @entity235 said , blaming ' sectors who do n't want peace			0
' political scientist @entity247 of the @entity248 supported the theory that the @entity51 was to blame as it ' seeks to show itself to the world as an organization sufficiently strong militarily and no only a weak organization that is only looking to negotiate with the government			0
' the @entity51 has been seeking peace talks and last month released what it said were its last ' political prisoners , ' 10 police and soldiers held for as many as 14 years			0
in newspaper columns and on the radio , @entity15 has n't just attacked the @entity51 as standard - bearer of @entity11 's right wing			2
