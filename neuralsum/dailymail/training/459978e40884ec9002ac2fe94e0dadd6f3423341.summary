workers are burrowing through 700 feet of rock and dirt to stop @entity4 's drinking water from seeping into the ground before it gets to the city			1
once they dig down below the @entity9 , crews will build a 2.5 - mile bypass tunnel to replace a section of the @entity12 that has been leaking up to 35million gallons of water each day for decades			1
the $ 1.5billion project , which takes place about 75 miles north of @entity16 , will enable the longest continuous tunnel in the world to continue providing about half of the metropolis 's water			1
the work illustrates the ingenious complexity of delivering 1.1billion gallons of water for 9 million people and the intricate efforts to keep water flowing smoothly as the sprawling network of tunnels ages the @entity12 will have to be temporarily drained for repairs in 2022 during the end stage of the project			1
a portion of the price tag is devoted to making sure other water sources continue to flow smoothly during the shut - off , the first time since the late 1950s			1
the tunnel was constructed between 1939 and 1944 and runs as deep as 1,500 below ground at some points , according to @entity72			2
' the goal of the city in constructing the waterworks was to construct something comparable to the great works of @entity78 , to last through the ages , ' said @entity80 , deputy commissioner of @entity4 's @entity81			1
' it 's with that spirit and with that purpose that this work here continues the tradition			0
' more than a trickle : parts of the @entity12 north of @entity4 leak as many as 35million gallons of water every day long way down : the aqueduct , which was built during the @entity51 - era , goes as low as 1,500 below ground at some points the @entity12 carries 500 million gallons of water a day from four reservoirs in the @entity97 in southeastern @entity98 to a distributing reservoir at the city 's doorstep			1
the tunnel , wide enough to drive a car through , is one of two major arteries that carry unfiltered water from bucolic countryside areas of the @entity97 and @entity12 watersheds			1
the aqueduct , a marvel of engineering relies solely on pressure and gravity but is aging			0
the @entity81 has known of leaks since the the 1990s and has monitored the tunnel with a camera - equipped @entity116 , or submarine drone			2
the area where the aqueduct goes through limestone are lined with steel , and cracks have formed when the tunnel transitions back to reinforced concrete			0
the waterway is so leaky in one stretch through rural @entity128 that @entity4 is buying dozens of homes above it that were plagued with repeatedly flooded basements and squishy lawns			2
residents often spend money pumps and other repairs to combat the damage and the @entity81 has given millions to help the the leaks are far worse where the tunnel travels under the @entity9 by @entity39 , but homes are not affected			0
between 15 million and 35 million gallons of water seep through cracks each day , enough to quench a small city			0
the bypass will permanently replace the leakiest portion of the tunnel			0
the other cracked stretch will be repaired using grout			0
working around the problem : crews will build a 2.5 - mile bypass tunnel to replace parts of the @entity12 with the worst flooding pavement problems : cracks have formed in the tunnel where the steel lining in limestone areas turns back into reinforced concrete load of rubble : piles of blasted shale rock need to be scooped up and taken to the surface in the repetitive process needed to reach hundreds of feet below ground before workers begin digging the bypass tunnel next year , they first need to complete the entry shafts on opposite sides of the @entity9 at @entity39 and @entity25			1
since late 2013 , workers have been drilling into the shale , scooping up the blasted rocks with a crane and then repeating the process			0
the result is a deep , 30 - foot diameter shaft in @entity25			0
workers in hard hats guide giant buckets of rock from the dark , drizzly bottom to the disc of daylight high above			0
' it 's a very repetitive process , ' said @entity184 , a project manager			2
the massive project , scheduled to finish in 2023 , is just one big - ticket item needed to keep water flowing smoothly through the massive system			1
a filtration plant in the @entity190 expected to handle up to 30 per cent of the city 's needs will cost $ 3.5 billion , and $ 4.7 billion has been spent to build a third water tunnel beneath the city			1
ambitious aqueduct : @entity80 , ( left ) deputy commissioner of the @entity81 , said that @entity4 wanted to construct a waterworks system comparable to @entity78 long wait : the bypass tunnel and other parts of the project are scheduled to be completed in 2023 after the temporary shutdown of the @entity12 the work that will repair , rather than replace , the other leaky stretch is especially tricky because the aqueduct carrying half the city 's water will have to be shut down for six months starting in 2022			1
the shutdowns means four of the city 's major reservoirs will be out of service temporarily			0
keeping the water flowing while patching up a main artery can be as tricky as repairing an airplane in flight			2
but mr @entity80 said the city will rely on alternate water sources and conservation			0
the roughly century - old @entity217 , which is 74 miles long , will be scrubbed and updated to increase its flow in time for the shutdown of its companion aqueduct , and the city will rely on water from @entity224 and wells in @entity226			2
on the conservation side , the @entity4 plans to update bathroom fixtures in its public schools and has started a voucher program for up to 800,000 water - saving toilets for qualified houses and apartments			1
if all goes as planned , @entity4 turning their faucets will never notice			2
' it will happen seamlessly in the city , ' mr @entity80 said			0
' they will continue to get their water			0
' a billion gallons a day : numerous measures to keep @entity4 's water flowing , including a filtration plant in the @entity190 , are being taken in advance of the aqueduct 's shutdown makover money : more than $ 8billion dollars have been spent on improvements to @entity4 's water system besides the @entity12 repairs			1
