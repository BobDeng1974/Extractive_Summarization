there 's something about a city on a beach			1
not a city on a river , but on a proper sandy holiday beach			2
just knowing that for half the year you can take a dip in the @entity9 after work , or sip rosé on the terrace of a seafront restaurant as the sun sets must be like living in a perpetual mr @entity16 adventure , where you enter the fancy dress shop , trade your suit for a sundress , and walk through the magic door to a beach party			2
i 've been to a handful of ' beach at the end of the street ' cities in @entity28 and the @entity29 , but the only one i know where you walk through cobbled lanes and past @entity35 palaces to get there is @entity36			0
if you ca n't wangle living there full - time , then @entity36 must surely be a top contender for the best city break destination			1
an overview of @entity36 , the city of contrasting art and architecture with a handy beach alongside it one moment visitors are marvelling at such landmarks as @entity50 's unfinished @entity49 ... ... the next locals and tourists alike are strolling to the beach for an after swim or game of volleyball first of all , there 's the jaw dropping architecture			1
no other city in the world has as many buildings on the @entity63 world heritage list as @entity36 , from @entity65 walls to the fantastical creations of @entity50			1
finally , after a number of false starts , @entity67 got to stay at the iconic hotel arts there 's enough art and culture to keep you busy for a decade of weekend breaks , plus cracking food , colourful markets and plenty of places to party all night long			1
we stayed at the @entity81 , a modern masterpiece of the city			1
it 's a glittering 44 - storey skyscraper of glass and steel , towering over the beaches and @entity88 as well as the nearby old fishermen 's quarter of @entity91 , where a warren of narrow streets are festooned with laundry from apartments above the tiny tapas bars			1
the contrast could jar , but in this eclectic city it works			2
at the foot of the hotel is @entity104 's huge futuristic sculpture of a golden fish , @entity106 , installed to mark the @entity107			1
i 've wanted to stay at the @entity81 since i read about it in @entity110 in 1997 , when it won its @entity112 in the @entity113 , but i 've had a few false starts along the way			1
i first brushed shoulders with it on a hen weekend a year later , when there was still a sombrero - full of pesetas to the pound			0
i persuaded the girls to pack away the l - plates and head there for cocktails ( it probably doubled the budget of the whole weekend ) before we rushed back to the nightclubs of @entity131			0
in 2012 , i tried to book a stay there during @entity135 's clash with @entity36 in the semi-final of the @entity137 , but there must have been an ' oligarchs - only ' policy because it was fully booked			1
just last year , i was chairing a conference in the city , where we had a reception on the hotel 's terraces			1
during the evening , @entity36 's charismatic mayor , @entity148 , made an impassioned case for @entity151 independence , before taking questions in @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			0
@entity67 calls @entity81 as a modern masterpiece , a glittering 44 - storey skyscraper of glass and steel the footpath for walkers and joggers along @entity163 with @entity81 and @entity165 tower behind now , finally , i was here , unencumbered by work , football fans or hen weekends , with no more baggage than a weekend case			1
although it 's only a two hour hop from @entity173 , unfortunately that 's not where i started from			0
i arrived after midnight , somewhat jaded after a long - haul flight from @entity176 , but was quickly revived by the warm reception from staff and the cool lobby , where the flower arrangements look like art installations			0
things were just livening up in @entity104 's bar ( named after the creator of the fish sculpture ) where the signature cocktails were delicious and the staff were so friendly that it would have been churlish not to have another one			0
one building our writer is always drawn to , among the stunning buildings of @entity36 , is @entity50 's @entity194 so it was not until the following morning that we could appreciate the views from our room - from one window we could see @entity88 and the shining @entity9 , from another we could make out @entity50 's unfinished church , the @entity200			1
the old city was a 15 - minute stroll along the beachfront which was buzzing even on a winter weekend , with volleyball matches , sailing and paddle - boarding taking place			2
the narrow streets and medieval alleyways of the gothic quarter opened unexpectedly on to grand squares , so we suddenly found ourselves in front of a cathedral or a gem of a @entity215 palace			0
of all the stunning buildings , the one i 'm drawn to every time is @entity50 's @entity194 , a building of curves and flowing lines covered in tiny mosaic and wrought iron balconies			1
it 's like nothing else			0
by sunset we 'd made it up to the @entity229 the building is breathtaking - it 's modelled on the @entity231 in @entity65 - and inside has some of the most astounding ancient frescos removed from churches in the @entity234			2
tourists pose in front of the @entity237 , a breathtaking building modelled on @entity65 's @entity231 of course , in @entity36 you 're never far from a bar and the hallmark of every good city break is large amount of eating and drinking to had among all that marching and culture			2
in fact , we seemed to dine in an obscenely large number of places given that we were only in the city for a weekend			0
@entity249 is a beachfront favourite - the food is excellent and there 's a @entity253 @entity252 feel , even though it 's on the fringes of @entity91			2
near the @entity200 , the @entity255 is worth a visit just for the pastries			0
the two @entity259 - starred @entity258 is the flagship restaurant of @entity81 - it 's stunning but not stuffy my out and out favourite was @entity265			1
it 's not much to look at from the outside , but the atmosphere is laidback and bohemian , the chef works creative magic with whatever has arrived from the market that day , and the results are truly amazing			0
the food at the @entity81 is considered among the finest in @entity36			2
the two @entity259 - starred @entity258 is the flagship restaurant - it 's stunning but not stuffy , and you fully expect @entity278 to be dining with @entity279 at the next table ( @entity81 is where she and many @entity281 stay )			1
perhaps fittingly , given @entity258 's superstar status , we were served @entity285 from @entity286 and @entity288 's estate in @entity289			1
@entity81 offers rooms from € 245 ( £ 180 ) per night , including breakfast			2
@entity292 ( 0844 493 0787 ) offers flights to @entity36 from @entity294 and @entity295			0
return fares start from £ 74			0
in @entity36 , the art is n't just in museums			0
as we wandered down a side street past a small , open - fronted car park , one of the prime spots was taken up by a huge avant garde sculpture of a bull			0
it 's a great city to get lost in and some of the best sights are n't in the tourist guides			1
there are not so many ' must sees ' that you need to have a precise agenda			0
anyway , i 'd rather miss out on another art exhibition and linger over lunch , all the time hoping that , unlike in mr @entity16 , the shopkeeper does n't suddenly appear and invite me to go home .			0

@entity67 stayed at the modern masterpiece @entity81
dined in the hotel 's two @entity259 - starred flagship restaurant , @entity258
@entity323 from @entity286 and @entity288 's estate in @entity289
of all the stunning buildings , the one i 'm drawn to is @entity50 's @entity194
a great city to get lost in with some of the best sights not in tourist guides
