by @entity1 reporter published : 17:33 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 01:54 est , 8 october 2012 teenagers who play violent video games over a number of years become more aggressive towards other people as a result , according to a new long - term study			1
researchers said the study was the first to show a clear link between a sustained period of playing violent games and subsequent increases in hostile behaviour			1
girls who play violent computer games during their school years were found to be affected just as much as boys			1
study findings : those who play violent games over a long period may become more likely to react aggressively to unintentional provocations ( file picture ) the research team at @entity27 in @entity28 said their results were ' concerning ' and wrote that violent games could ' reinforce the notion that aggression is an effective and appropriate way to deal with conflict and anger '			1
evidence suggests that long - term players of violent games may become more likely to react aggressively to unintentional provocations such as someone accidentally bumping into them , they added			1
the findings come after a coroner urged parents to stop children using adult video games following the death of @entity47 , 14 , from @entity48 , who hanged himself after playing the certificate 18 game @entity50 , which features gruesomely realistic scenes of soldiers trying to kill each other			2
@entity55 , the @entity56 who killed 77 people , claimed earlier this year that he had played @entity50 to train himself for his ' bloody and horrendous ' operation			0
the study , published in the journal @entity62 , involved 1,492 adolescents at eight high schools in @entity65 , 51 per cent of whom were female and 49 per cent male			2
surveys were carried out annually across four school years with the participants aged 14 or 15 at the start of the study and 17 or 18 at its conclusion			1
influenced ? @entity55 , the @entity56 who killed 77 people , claimed earlier this year that he had played video game @entity50 to train himself the teenagers were asked a series of questions such as how often they pushed or shoved people and whether they they frequently kick or punch people who make them angry			0
psychologists used this to give each individual a score for their aggression level at each point in time			0
' this is an important and concerning finding , particularly in light of the hours that youth spend playing these games ' professor @entity89 , lead researcher they were also asked whether they played action or fighting video games			0
in the final two years of the study they were also asked how frequently they played such games , ranging from never to for five or more hours per day			2
analysis showed that teenagers who played violent video games over a number of years saw steeper rises in their aggression scores during the study			1
others who regularly played non-violent games did not show any evidence of increased aggression			0
the trend remained even after taking into account other variables that could be linked to aggression such as gender , parental divorce and marijuana use			0
in reverse : the @entity28 study found no evidence that aggressive teenagers were simply more likely to play violent games ( file picture ) importantly , the study found no evidence that teens who were more aggressive to begin with were simply more likely to play violent games			2
pupils with high aggression scores in @entity128 were not more likely to play violent games in @entity129			0
but those who played violent games regularly in @entity129 were rated as more aggressive the next year			0
' the study as a whole does provide one of the strongest pieces of empirical evidence to date that there is a direct relationship between playing violent video games and subsequent aggressive behaviour ' professor @entity139 , @entity141 video - game specialist lead researcher professor @entity89 said : ' the current study is the first to demonstrate a relation between sustained violent video game play and the progression of aggressive behaviour			1
' it is clear that there is a long - term association between violent video games and aggression			1
this is an important and concerning finding , particularly in light of the hours that youth spend playing these games			0
' professor @entity139 , director of the @entity156 at @entity157 , said : ' the study as a whole does provide one of the strongest pieces of empirical evidence to date that there is a direct relationship between playing violent video games and subsequent aggressive behaviour			2
' prof @entity166 said further research could look at whether the effect is solely due to violent content or whether fast - paced action and competition may also play a part .			0
