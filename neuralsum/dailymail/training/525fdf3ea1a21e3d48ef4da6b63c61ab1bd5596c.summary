by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 12:11 est , 18 may 2012 clouds of smoke belch from forests of chimneys , while armies of spidery figures scuttle to and fro between narrow terrace houses and imposing factory gates			0
crowds of fans shiver on the edge of a football field , a fist - fight breaks out , and barefoot children tease a stray cat on the street corner			0
these are the scenes depicted in the haunting paintings of @entity19 who , more than any other artist , managed to capture the strange , bleak beauty of daily life in northern industrial towns			1
recognition : @entity19 , ( pictured in 1957 ) , the artist from @entity25 , is the subject of a major new show at the @entity29 gallery - the first such exhibition in a public institution in @entity32 since his death in 1976 his dream - like images captured the popular imagination , adorning chocolate boxes and biscuit tins , tea towels and jigsaws			1
yet they are scarcely to be found on the walls of our major national galleries			2
the @entity45 owns 23 of his works , but has only ever exhibited one on its walls in the past 20 years — and then only briefly			1
‘ it is a shame , verging on the iniquitous , that foreign visitors to @entity32 should n’t have access to the painter @entity55 people like more than most others , ’ thundered the actor sir @entity56 in a television documentary last year , suggesting an anti-northern , anti-working - class conspiracy against the flat - capped @entity59			1
disappointing : actor sir @entity56 said last year it was a shame , verging on the iniquitous , that foreign visitors to @entity32 should n't have access to the painter but @entity19 ’s exile is coming to an end			1
earlier this week , the @entity29 announced that it will stage a vast @entity19 retrospective next year			1
it will be the first such exhibition in a public institution in @entity32 since the artist ’s death in 1976			1
why has it taken so long ? ‘ he ’s a victim of his own fan base , ’ said @entity70 , @entity29 ’s @entity71			1
‘ what makes @entity19 so popular is the same thing which stops him being the subject of serious critical attention			1
what attracts so many is a sort of sentimentality about him			0
’ this is a strangely inverted piece of art world logic , where the popularity of an artist is seen as an obstacle to showing their work			0
what has the @entity45 been afraid of for all these years ? did they fear that the walls of its gallery would be breached by a violent stampede of clog - wearing northerners ? the art establishment has long had a patrician aversion to proletarian schmaltz — a prejudice that @entity19 is not a ' proper ' artist , but someone to be confined to the gift shop			1
it is a stigma he battled his whole career			0
he was deeply ashamed of having to make a living by working as a rent - collector , seen by his contemporaries not as an artist but as ' a man who paints '			0
by day , he tramped the streets of @entity113 , from where he got so much of his inspiration			0
he observed children playing in the road , workers filing in and out of the factory , mothers gossiping , teenagers fighting , market traders selling their wares , and the prosaic daily grind of having to pay the rent			0
later , his observations would take a darker turn , including the blitz and subsequent rebuilding , slum clearances and new housing			0
the cloud of melancholy that hangs over all of @entity19 ’s work has a deep - rooted history in his unhappy childhood			1
he was born in 1887 in @entity137 , between @entity25 and @entity113 , to parents underwhelmed by his arrival			0
at first , his mother had difficulty even looking at him , and later expressed envy of her sister having ‘ three splendid daughters ’ instead of ‘ one clumsy boy ’			0
his father , who worked as a clerk for a property company , was an introverted man whom @entity19 described as a ‘ cold fish ’ , happy to fade into the background like one of his own anonymous stickmen			1
it was a repressive family atmosphere , and painting presented a natural escape			0
or , as @entity19 himself put it : ' @entity156 said i was no good for anything else , so they might as well send me to art school			1
’ reappraisal : a scene of @entity165 , one of @entity19 's rare views of @entity32 , sold for £ 5.6million last year his naive , almost cartoonish style always led many to assume he was self - taught , but he attended art college in @entity25 and @entity113 , studying under the @entity171 impressionist @entity172			1
he only ever used five colours — ivory , black , vermilion , @entity178 blue and yellow ochre — and worked the paint with sticks and fingers , stabbing at the canvas with both ends of the brush			0
the surfaces of his paintings are scratched and scruffy — a total rejection of the formality of high ' academic ' style			0
as a result , he was often dismissed as an amateur , a ‘ sunday painter ’ — to which he once retorted : ' if so , i ’m a sunday painter who paints every day of the week ! ' a review of one of his earliest exhibitions in 1921 described his style as ‘ authentically primitive ’ , as if this simple creature had been discovered daubing the walls of his cave			2
it is a stylistic — and class - based — prejudice that has remained to this day			0
his paintings represent a world many have forgotten : the drudgery of pre and post-war @entity29 when life was rendered in shades of grey			1
he painted the city as it was : drenched in a grimy industrial haze			0
before the dark satanic mills were rebranded as bohemian ' loft apartments ' filled with boutique galleries and organic coffee shops , they were dirty , chugging , noxious things			0
they were even a shock to the young @entity219 , coming from the leafy @entity25 suburb of @entity221			2
a lack of money forced his family move to the industrial town of @entity226 when he was 22 , replacing a familiar landscape of trees with one choked by chimneys			0
' at first i detested it , ' he recalled			0
' and then , after years , i got pretty interested in it , then obsessed by it			2
' interest : @entity19 was born in @entity137 , @entity59 and many of his drawings and paintings depict scenes of life in the industrial districts of @entity240 one day he missed a train and happened upon the @entity247 ’s mill , ‘ a huge black framework of rows of yellow - lit windows standing up against the sad , damp charged afternoon sky ’			1
the mill was turning out at the end of the day , hundreds of bodies flooding out of the gates , a swarm of ants moving as one tidal mass. ‘ i watched this scene — which i ’d looked at many times without seeing — with rapture			2
’ @entity19 ’s was always a particular kind of observation , conducted at a remove from the people in his gaze			1
it is telling that his scenes are always painted from a raised , bird ’s eye viewpoint , looking down on the life played out below as if a children ’s game			2
@entity270 is people are pliable , doll - like figures , observed from a safe distance , without ever getting too involved			0
faces are fleshy smears , features hidden behind turned - up collars and deep - brimmed hats			0
his figures are hunched , burdened things , weighed down by cumbersome clogs and bulky overcoats			0
or else they are stick - thin spindles , insignificant human flotsam ready to be blown away on the next gust			0
for a painter who now enjoys such popularity , @entity19 was singularly antisocial , a withdrawn outsider			1
he lived alone , never married , and at the age of 88 he claimed he had ' never had a woman ' , poignantly adding : ' had i not been lonely none of my works would have happened			2
' although he was not short of money in his later years , he did not earn the fortunes that his works now command			1
his @entity297 ( 1949 ) sold at @entity298 for £ 5.6 million in may last year and the same astronomical price was reached by his @entity165 ( 1960 ) in november			2
he died just months before a retrospective exhibition at the @entity301 that broke all attendance records for a 20th - century artist			2
and it is this common popularity that makes @entity19 so divisive			1
his vision of northern , working - class towns is one that has always garnered loyal popular affection , but it is this same laconic portrayal of the day - to - day public rituals of urban life , executed in a distinctly childlike manner , that has been anathema to the rarefied world of the art establishment			0
collectable : @entity19 was not short of money in his later years , but after his death his works , including an @entity316 ( pictured ) as featured in a sale of @entity318 at @entity298 , generated huge amounts at auction and the condescension only increased as the artist ’s influence spread beyond the gallery			1
two years after his death , his work was the inspiration for a sing - along pop song , @entity329 , which spent three weeks at the top of the charts			2
' he painted @entity113 ’s smokey tops / on cardboard boxes from the shops , ' sang one - hit wonders @entity336 on @entity337 , dressed in breeches and flat caps , gently strumming their guitars , as girls from @entity342 swayed in the background			2
‘ they said he just paints cats and dogs / and matchstalk men in boots and clogs / and @entity19 said that ’s just the way they ’ll stay			1
’ it may not be quite what the @entity45 has in mind , but it provided a fitting tribute to this astute recorder of everyday modern urban life			2
next year , 80 of his works will be shown together on the walls of the illustrious institution for the first time , finally installing this wild outsider in his rightful place — in the famous gallery appropriately founded by a fellow @entity59 , sugar magnate @entity45			1
national treasure : the @entity297 by @entity19 , which he painted in 1949 , went for £ 5.6million in may last year			1

the @entity45 owns 23 of his works , but has only ever exhibited one on its walls in the past 20 years
@entity19 ’s @entity32 exile is coming to an end with the @entity29 announcing a vast retrospective next year
