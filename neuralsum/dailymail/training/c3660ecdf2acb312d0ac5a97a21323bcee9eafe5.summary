by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 8 march 2013 top gear has sparked a major row in @entity3 after authorities were forced to apologise to @entity5 for letting the show film a high - speed stunt on a ' spiritual ' beach			1
staff from the @entity11 's flagship motoring show are set to descend on @entity12 next week to record a 150kmh scene for the programme , which is fronted by @entity15			1
the move has led to an outcry by @entity5 peoples after the broadcaster was granted special permission to use the beach - also known as @entity12 - at short notice			1
@entity23 : an aerial view of @entity25 , part of @entity12 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity3 , where the @entity1 team plan to film the filming schedule means a 50km stretch of the beach , which is also classed as a public road with a speed limit of 100kph , could be closed for several hours a day for up to a week			1
it has not yet been revealed whether @entity15 , 52 , or fellow presenters @entity38 or @entity39 will be getting behind the wheel of the speeding car , which will be followed by a chase car to record the action			0
the sprawling beach , in @entity27 on @entity3 's north island , is used by @entity5 for food gathering and recreations as well as for spiritual reasons			1
a spokesman for @entity50 said the @entity11 had been granted special dispensation to film the stunt , along with other pieces for future episodes , on the beach between march 11 and march 17			1
the council had to grant permission for the closure without going through its normal process - advertising the proposals and allowing two weeks for public submissions - because the request came in just 14 days before the beach needed to be closed			1
five @entity5 iwi ( peoples ) - @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 - have custodianship of the beach but the council only approached @entity69 for permission to grant the road closure outside the normal process			1
controversial : top gear with @entity39 , @entity15 and @entity38 @entity77 : ( left to right ) presenters @entity15 and @entity38 may attend the @entity1 live photo call in @entity80 , @entity81 the council spokesman apologised to the iwi for the lack of consultation , adding that the beach would only be closed in short stretches for just five minutes at a time during the high - speed scenes			1
other stretches of the beach would be shut down for up to 45 minutes at a time on two of the other days of filming , he added			2
' the council has apologised ( to the other iwi ) that we did n't take the consultation far enough and we will be taking steps to ensure appropriate consultation is done in the future , ' the spokesman said			2
@entity1 is one of the @entity11 's most successful programmes , but has run into plenty of controversy along the way			1
in november 2008 he made a joke about how tough it is to change gear in a lorry - and linked it to the @entity110 , who murdered sex workers in @entity112			0
going around the world : the @entity114 ( back ) , @entity39 ( left ) @entity38 ( centre ) and @entity15 of @entity1 @entity15 said : ' change gear , change gear , change gear , check mirror , murder a prostitute , change gear , change gear , murder			0
that 's a lot of effort in a day			2
' in february 2009 , @entity15 famously called then - prime minister @entity126 a ' one - eyed @entity128 idiot '			0
a year later he illustrated dangerous driving conditions with a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red g - string , which was branded ' distasteful '			0
spin doctor @entity134 revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment @entity15 was asked by him about gay rights and he replied , ' i demand the right not to be bummed			0
' in other gaffes he compared a @entity141 to a person with special needs , called @entity144 ' lazy ' , ' feckless ' and ' flatulent ' , said long queues at airport control could be solved by ' a bit of racism ' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints			2
earlier this year he compared a @entity155 car to the @entity156 and people with ' growths on their faces '			0
the @entity161 's editorial standards committee this week gave him another slap on the wrist for the scripted remarks , ruling that he had ' strayed into an offensive stereotypical assumption '			2
probably his most shocking moment came on @entity167 , where he said that striking public sector workers ' should be shot in front of their families '			0
@entity15 was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark sparked around 31,700 complaints			0
he was later cleared .			0
