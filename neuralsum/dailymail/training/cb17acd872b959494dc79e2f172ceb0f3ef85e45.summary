by @entity0 published : 01:43 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 27 february 2013 on paper it looked like an @entity5 fan 's dream come true - a ' vip trip ' to the @entity8 courtesy of @entity9			1
but the competition winner has since had a complaint to the advertising watchdog upheld after his experience turned out to be far from glamorous			2
the man , who was accompanied by his brother , was flown on a budget airline via two different countries , had to arrange his own travel for the 150 - mile round trip and the pair ended up sharing a hotel bed			2
drama : @entity24 crashes during the @entity8 last year - one of the most prestigious races of the year - though the competition winners had to leave early missing out : the ' vip ' competition winners missed @entity28 lift the trophy after winning the @entity8 because they had to catch a flight 90 miles away the pair , who have not been named , were flown to @entity33 , @entity34 , ahead of the race on august 31 last year			1
they then had to pay their own way to @entity38 in @entity39 to arrive at their hotel and then travel a further 45 miles to the @entity42 in @entity43			1
after carrying their suitcases to the track , they were forced to leave early , missing @entity28 's winning performance , in order to catch their flight home from @entity53 another 70 miles away			1
the competition had promised : ' we 're giving one winner a pair of tickets to watch the action as well as flights and accommodation at the four - star @entity40 for two nights			1
' after their travel woes the brothers had to share a bed because the hotel had ignored their request for two singles			0
at the race they found their tickets were in grandstand rather than the vip area			0
the winner complained to the @entity75 , questioning whether the competition had been properly represented and whether the vip description of the prize was misleading			0
@entity9 said that the conditions were made clear prior to entry , and pointed out that the @entity8 was one of the most prestigious races on the @entity5 calendar			0
the ad did not claim that event tickets were @entity77 and that the @entity77 headline referred to the entire package which included tickets to the event , flights and accommodation at a four - star hotel			1
embarrassing : @entity9 has been rapped after the winner of this ' vip trip ' competition suffered a dreadful experience race : the competition winners were flown to @entity33 , @entity34 , and had to pay their way to @entity38 in @entity39 to arrive at their hotel and then travel a further 45 miles to the @entity42 ( above ) in @entity43 because the flight was short haul only one class of travel was available and the tickets to the race cost £ 300 each			1
@entity9 accepted that the winner flew into @entity109 in @entity34 and was then required to travel to the hotel which was located in the @entity111 and , after travelling to the event in @entity43 , returned home from @entity53 airport			1
but the company pointed out that he been informed beforehand that he would have to organise his own travel			0
not quite four - star treatment : the pair were forced to share a bed for two nights after a mix - up at the @entity40 hotel in @entity38 , @entity43 the company apologised that despite specifying to the hotel two single beds on behalf of the complainant and his companion , they had failed to provide this			1
and once it became clear they had to leave early for the return flight they had offered to cover the complainant ’s expenses			0
but the @entity75 upheld the complaints saying the pitfalls of the holiday had not been made clear			0
it said : ' we considered that information relating to the different locations of the event , airport and hotel , and that travel to and from them was not included , was significant information likely to influence consumers ’ understanding of the promotion and should therefore have been stated clearly in the promotional material			0
' ' we considered that the term “ vip ” , in the context of the ad , was likely to be understood by readers as exclusive , and specifically non-standard , and that they would not expect , unless otherwise stated in the promotion , for the flights to be with a budget airline			0
' we also considered that “ @entity77 ” had a specific meaning in the ticketing industry and that , given that the @entity8 issued tickets that included admission to a vip area , readers would expect the winning tickets to include this			2
' the ad must not appear again in its current form			0
' at least someone had something to celebrate : @entity174 technical director @entity173 and @entity28 shared the champagne after winning the @entity8 in september			2

two competition winners had been promised ' @entity77 ' trip to @entity43 @entity8
had to pay for travel via @entity39 and @entity34 themselves to watch race
shared bed at four - star hotel after mix - up
missed @entity28 lifting trophy to catch flight home 90 miles away
complaint upheld by watchdog who said ad must not appear again
