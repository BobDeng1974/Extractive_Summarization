by @entity0 he is a bald , tall , male barber and grandfather			0
she is his blonde girlfriend			2
somehow , he was able to travel on an international flight with her passport , without a word from any authorities he passed on the way			2
@entity10 , 50 , did n't notice he had grabbed his partner @entity11 's travel documents when he left for his flight to @entity14 from @entity15 to celebrate a 50th birthday in @entity17 where he was staying with friends			1
because he was only travelling with hand luggage , @entity10 only had to show his boarding pass to get through airport security			2
the passport of @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right )			1
@entity10 used @entity11 's passport by mistake when travelling to @entity25 , but still managed to board the plane , as no one noticed his error spot the difference : @entity10 , left , was able to board a plane with his girlfriend 's passport , which he took to the airport by accident , despite the fact that his girlfriend , @entity11 , right , is a blonde woman and not a bald man the grandfather - of - five had breakfast at the airport , and then flashed his passport to a @entity43 member of staff at the gate and boarded the plane			1
and after the two - and - three - quarter hour flight , he successfully breezed through passport control at @entity49 without a word from the @entity25 authorities			1
he only realised his mistake when he and his friends were comparing passport pictures and he discovered he had used his partner 's documents			1
@entity10 , who is bald and has a goatee , said he was astonished authorities had failed to pick up on the mistake even though his girlfriend , also 50 , has long , blonde hair			1
@entity10 ( front ) pictured with his friends in @entity25			1
he realised the mistake when he got to @entity14 where he was celebrating a friend 's birthday mr @entity10 , from @entity66 , @entity67 , said : ' i handed my passport over with the boarding card when we went to board the plane and she scanned them			1
' then we got in to @entity25 and went through passport control and i flashed the passport and they never said anything			1
' me and my mates were joking about our bad passport pictures and they looked at mine and said " @entity10 , you 're much better looking in this picture than in real life "			1
' i ca n't believe this could happen , especially after all the trouble with the missing @entity88 aircraft			0
mr @entity10 was flying to @entity14 from @entity15 , where it is their policy to only check boarding passes in the event of someone boarding a flight with just hand luggage in mr @entity10 's case it was up to the airline to check that his passport details were in order ' with this plane going missing and people on there with the wrong passport you would 've thought they would have been a bit more vigilant			1
' f i can get through then who knows what else could happen			0
' i got through on to the plane and got through passport control in @entity25 and did n't get stopped by one person			1
' they need to crack down at @entity116 airports big time			0
' @entity10 had to pay £ 70 to have his passport sent to @entity25 via @entity119 , but was forced to wait in the hotel for the entire three - day break because it needed to be signed for			1
a @entity43 employee failed to check the passport details , and neither did border control staff in @entity25 further delays came when the company accidentally sent the document to @entity129 before redirecting it to @entity17 - meaning he missed his flight home on march 19			1
luckily , @entity135 bosses agreed to fly him back the next day for free and two suited representatives were even waiting for him when he landed			0
@entity10 , who has five children from another relationship and has been with receptionist @entity11 , for 12 months , said they were both worried about the mistake			1
he said : ' i phoned my girlfriend and asked her to send it by @entity143 but they would n't take it because it was a passport			2
' we said it was important travel documents to @entity119 and they collected it , it cost me £ 70			2
' they got it on the first plane but it went to @entity129			0
then it was in @entity158 on the wednesday but it did n't reach @entity14 so i lost my flight			1
' it arrived on a day later and i flew back then			0
after the two - and - three - quarter hour flight , he even successfully got through airport security in @entity25 with his girlfriend 's passport ' it completely ruined my holiday			1
i could n't leave the hotel because i was waiting and needed to sign it and @entity119 kept saying it would be there and it kept getting delayed			2
' it was a waste of a break and i lost a day of work as well because i should have been home on the thursday			0
' there were two suited and booted @entity43 reps waiting with a plaque with my name on it when i landed			2
' they wanted to know what happened			0
' they asked if i would be willing to point out the woman who let me through because it was a serious breach of security			0
' but i did n't want to do that to her so i refused			0
i 've heard nothing from them since			0
' @entity15 airport explained that when a passenger has only hand luggage , they only have to present their boarding pass to pass through to the departure lounge , where it is then the airline 's responsibility to check that a passenger has the correct passport			2
@entity43 has been sought for comment			2
@entity203 judge @entity202 , expert on terrorism who investigated a terrorist cell , said : ' for these groups , passports are as important as weapons			0
' @entity211 terrorism networks have been using false passports for years in order to carry out attacks on different countries			0
notorious terrorist , @entity216 , used a counterfeit @entity218 passport to enter @entity219 and apply for political asylum			0
while living there , he supplied fake @entity219 passports to other @entity223 , also using a fake @entity219 passport under the alias of @entity226 in his failed attempt to enter the @entity203 and bomb @entity228			0
@entity211 depends on the ability to travel internationally in order to raise funds , recruit operatives , train the operatives in @entity235 and send them out to plan and conduct terrorist attacks			0
one of the first lines of defence against this is airport and airline security checks , so airports and airline staff have to be increasingly vigilant about their fake passports in order to prevent attacks .			0
