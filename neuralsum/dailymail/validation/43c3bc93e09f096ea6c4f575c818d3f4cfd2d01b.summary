i brought you the @entity3 haters test a few weeks ago – you can read it here			1
now it ’s time for the ‘ @entity6			2
’ what ’s the first thing you think about when you hear the name @entity10 ? a ) how close he is to breaking scoring records with @entity3 and @entity13 b ) any of the following - being punched in his kitchen by @entity15 , demanding a massive salary at @entity3 or barking into the camera at the @entity18 and at @entity19			1
if you answered b ) then i ’d question your passion for football			2
@entity10 played a key role in @entity3 's win over @entity25 on sunday @entity10 scored the third goal for @entity3 in their win at @entity28 @entity29 ca n't expect any loyalty from @entity31 if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as @entity33 @entity34 look knackered ... @entity35 must start putting his faith in youth or he 'll blow the @entity38 one thing i have discovered about @entity13 is that if you come from humble beginnings , but go on to improve your lot in life , the reaction of the rest of the country will be split			1
as you drive by in your expensive car , some will say ‘ good on him , he ’s done well for himself			0
’ others though will be less generous			0
they might say ‘ lucky sod ’ or ‘ he does n’t deserve that			0
’ jealousy is a terrible thing			0
these people will focus on anything but football			0
and @entity10 is a classic example			1
i take one look at @entity10 ’s career and i ’m seriously impressed			1
i find it hard to look at it any other way			0
@entity10 celebrated by mocking the story that he was knocked out in a playful fight with @entity15 @entity69 collapsed to the floor after scoring in reference to being ' knocked out ' by @entity15 @entity72 refuses to discuss ' ridiculous ' @entity10 story but others concentrate on things away from the football pitch and twist them into a reason to condemn @entity10			1
they see a working - class kid who played football in the streets of @entity29 , who made it big because of his talent , demanded big wages , lives in a massive house and they ca n’t stand him for it			2
they ca n’t handle that he did something they did n’t			0
they refuse to applaud someone who has made the most of his talent , realised his dreams and become very wealthy in the process			0
i even had one @entity98 clown so obsessed with bringing @entity10 down that he told me he had a violent streak – just because he fouled someone			1
so if you are a football lover , what was the big story on sunday ? was it @entity10 leading @entity3 superbly , scoring a brilliant goal and getting three crucial points against @entity25 ? @entity10 was criticised by some fans for swearing into a tv camera after scoring at @entity19 in 2011 @entity10 is closing in on goalscoring records for both @entity112 and @entity13 or was it @entity10 messing around in his own home with a mate and doing absolutely nothing wrong ? @entity10 ’s celebration said it all			1
i understand why it ’s a story of course – it ’s a great scoop			0
but is it a reason to hammer @entity10 ? and should he be judged as a footballer because of it ? those who ca n’t handle @entity10 ’s success need to look at themselves			1
are they upset because he achieved in life while they did n’t ? or do they dribble and drool over their keyboards because they hate everything about @entity3 ? @entity10 gets into every team in the world – from @entity3 to @entity142 to @entity143 and @entity144			1
that ’s my opinion , and of course , not everybody will share it			0
but he ’s not done badly for himself in his career			0
he went to @entity3 and became a club legend – that ’s not easy to achieve given the rich history of that great club			2
sometimes he could have conducted himself better on and off the field , but i can not see how any of that stuff deflects from his brilliance as a footballer			0
unless you hate @entity3 , or you ’re jealous of @entity10 ’s success and wealth			1
i ’ve got a message for @entity10 , keep knocking ' em out champ !			2

@entity10 is close to breaking records for @entity3 and @entity13
