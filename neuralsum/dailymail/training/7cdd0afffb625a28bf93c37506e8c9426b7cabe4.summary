by @entity0 @entity1 is convinced @entity2 can beat @entity3 and make it through to a dream @entity7 final despite @entity9 ’s absence			1
@entity2 will take on @entity3 at the @entity10 on tuesday without their best player and leading scorer , who was ruled out of the @entity7 after fracturing a verterbrae in last week ’s win over @entity16			1
an incredible wave of sadness followed the news that @entity9 had been ruled out			1
but @entity1 has moved on from the incident and he has challenged the rest of his squad to reach the @entity33 final for their injured star			1
' he has done his share			0
now it ’s up to us to do our share , ' the @entity2 coach told a press conference on the eve of the match			1
the end ? @entity9 broke a vertebra in his back after a challenge by @entity16 's @entity48 ' this match we ’ll be playing not just for ourselves but for our country , for everything we ’ve ever dreamed of , but also for @entity9 and everything he ’s done for us			1
' within our group , we ’ve accepted that			0
we ’ve left our sad phase behind and we ’re focusing on other things			0
' @entity1 had asked @entity9 to come to @entity58 for the semi-final , but a spokesman for the @entity2 football confederation said the forward would not attend the match and would instead continue his recuperation in @entity65			1
despair : @entity2 's hopes of winning the @entity7 have been severely dented by @entity9 's loss @entity1 used several different replacements for @entity9 and he also changed his formation during training , presumably to keep the gathered media and the @entity73 guessing about how his team would line up in @entity58			1
@entity75 and @entity76 are the two leading contenders to fill @entity9 's position , but @entity79 and @entity80 are two others who could be drafted in			1
@entity1 rejected out of hand two opportunities to name his starting xi in his pre-match press conference			2
mascot : @entity9 was asked to attend the semi-final against @entity3 but has been flown home for treatment whoever he does pick , @entity1 is sure they will be up to the task			1
' @entity9 is one of our references and one of the best players in the world , but we have another 22 players who have been hand - picked and capped because we know they are special , " the former @entity94 manager added			2
' those guys who come in are special			0
they can make a big difference			0
' this is what we are conveying to our players			0
we will miss @entity9 , but we have a team who can overcome the difficulties and go on into the next round			2
' that 's the goal the group has had since the beginning : to qualify for the final			0
' hair raising ! @entity75 is one possibility to replace @entity9 for @entity2 's semi-final showdown @entity1 admitted he could deploy three defensive midfielders against the @entity73 to counter the threat of players like @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			1
operating with three deep midfielders would go against @entity2 's tradition of all - out attack , but @entity1 has told the nation to trust him in what he is doing			1
' playing with three defensive midfielders is an option , ' he said			1
' if i have two players in there , the full - backs will have less freedom but i might be able to add something that imposes a bit more damage on @entity3 too			2
' park the bus ? @entity2 may use three defensive players to combat @entity120 and @entity3 's midfield @entity2 topped their group , but they were inconsistent in their first three matches			1
they then almost exited the tournament in the following round but won a nail - biting penalty shootout against @entity147			0
however , @entity2 finally lived up to their billing in @entity150 last week during a thrilling first - half display in which @entity16 were blown away			2
@entity9 's absence , and the step up in opposition , mean @entity1 should feel under more pressure than ever			1
but if the engaging @entity2 coach is nervous in any way , he was not letting it show on the night before the game			1
' i sleep very well , ' the jovial coach said with a grin			0
grin and bear it ! @entity1 was in a relaxed mood at the press conference ' the easiest thing for me is to put my head down and sleep			2
' i have a fantastic group of players and we have been watching @entity3 's games too			2
' we 've had scouts at their last two matches and our scouts have instructed us how we can beat them			0
' when you have a team working with you , a team of assistants , you feel more at ease making choices			0
' i know the starting line - up			0
tomorrow , when they walk on to the field , you will see why i made those choices			0
' i want to tell the @entity25 people : we 're doing our best , and doing what we think is necessary			0
' sometimes not in a very beautiful way , but we 're moving forward			0
one step at a time towards the final			0
' same again ? the @entity2 coach does n't want to taste disappointment after bringing home the @entity7 in 2002 the last time @entity2 won the @entity7 was 12 years ago , when @entity1 led the @entity2 to victory over @entity3			1
@entity1 has since tasted defeat against the three - time world champions with @entity197 , so he wants to get back to winning ways in the semi-final			2
' we won in 2002 with @entity2 but i lost in 2008 with @entity197			0
and then i lost the third / fourth place play - off in 2006 , also with @entity197 , so i have two defeats and one victory , he said			0
' in order to tie this up i have to win tomorrow , so i hope @entity2 play well , win and the memories are very good			2
