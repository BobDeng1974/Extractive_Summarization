by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 7 august 2013 this is the terrifying moment an angry female elephant charged a photographer as he took pictures from an open safari jeep			1
@entity6 was travelling through the @entity7 in @entity8 in an open safari jeep when he came within feet of a female @entity11 elephant who saw him and decided to charge			1
accompanied by her calf , the elephant and her previously peaceful herd began thundering down the track towards him			0
this is the terrifying sight that confronted photographer @entity6 when an @entity11 elephant , accompanied by her calf , charged him in @entity8 's @entity7 wildlife photographer mr @entity6 , 52 , who lives in @entity23 , said : ' the charge was extremely loud and violent - she obviously did n't want any human beings around			1
' his driver , whom he said was experienced in the ways of the local elephants , put his foot down and got them away safely , but not before mr @entity6 , who has won several photography awards , got this stunning image			2
mr @entity6 , who has studied and photographed elephants for more than 20 years , said the elephant 's behaviour was out of character			1
' this particular place is normally frequented with both visitors and animals , and the elephants are usually very sociable and quite used to people being around them , ' he said			0
female adult @entity11 elephants and their calves tend to move about together in groups of up to 15 , and for most of the year they are timid and unwilling to attack			2
however , rogue elephants , particularly those with calves , sometimes make unprovoked attacks on passers - by , taking up position near a road and making it impassable to travellers			0
shaken but not stirred : @entity6 , 52 , has spent 22 years studying and photographing elephants , but said the female charging him was out of character			0

@entity6 , 52 , of @entity23 , was taking pictures in @entity8 's @entity7 when the angry female *spotted* him
accompanied by her calf , the @entity11 elephant thundered towards mr @entity6 - and his driver sped away just in time
asian elephants are usually timid and unwilling to attack , but rogue elephants can *suddenly* become *aggressive*
