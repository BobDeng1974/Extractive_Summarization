by @entity0 a newly - married couple were left stunned - and the bride in tears - when they were hit with a $ 4,000 bar bill after celebrating their wedding at @entity11 's posh @entity10 restaurant - despite agreeing beforehand that the tab must be capped at $ 1,500			1
@entity12 and @entity13 were enjoying their dream day as they mingled with about 50 guests at the @entity19 restaurant , owned by celebrity chef @entity20 , on friday			1
but their celebrations were ruined when they were handed the bill as they went to leave - and realised it was $ 2,500 more than they had agreed , not including a compulsory $ 800 charge for gratuities and a further $ 1,000 deposit			1
the couple said the monster tab put their dream honeymoon - a two - month trip around @entity35 and @entity36 - under threat because they had to max out their credit cards to settle up , despite generous donations from guests			1
@entity13 and @entity42 had the best wedding day at @entity10 restaurant until they were slapped with a $ 4,800 bar bill the dreaded bill from @entity20 's ( pictured ) restaurant for the drinks , gratuities and remainder of the deposit ‘ i was flabbergasted to say the least , ’ mr @entity13 , 29 , told @entity53 just hours after the nuptials			1
‘ i told them they would have to take the clothes off my back because i have nothing to give them			0
’ ' i do n't know what we would have done without the help of our family and friends			0
' mr @entity13 said he and his new wife had held two meetings with @entity10 staff in the lead - up to their big day during which it was agreed that the couple would cap the bar bill at $ 1,500			1
‘ i told them to tap me on the shoulder as the bill got to $ 1,500 , ’ he said			1
‘ but they said that we should have put it in writing			0
' at no point did they claim any responsibility or offer to reduce the bill			2
i was right there - all they had to do was tap me on the shoulder			0
' the newly - named mrs @entity90 said the situation was very disappointing considering the staff , who helped organise their wedding , were fully aware of their budget			2
' they knew about our two - month holiday – we had a small intimate wedding for that reason , ' she said			2
' we chose @entity10 out of every possible venue in @entity11			1
' here comes the bride : @entity13 ( middle ) had the perfect wedding day until they received the hefty bill feeling on top of the world - little did the couple know that the rug was going to be pulled from under their big day mr @entity12 said management showed no empathy whatsoever other than offering the couple a payment plan for the outrageous amount			1
‘ it literally went from the best day to the worst day of our lives , ’ he said			0
' they just played technicalities and nonsense			0
there was no culpability or partial blame			0
' the bride said she was in a complete state of disbelief when her new husband told her the devastating news			0
‘ i thought it would it was going to be a completely cruisy day – we were all having such a great time , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s rare to get away with no issues – all we had was windy weather to contend with - i would have been happy with torrential rain but this just took the cake			0
’ after many tears and tantrums , the couple were left with no choice but to pay the hefty bill thanks to the generous help of their family and friends			1
the newlyweds managed to pull themselves together and go out with their loved ones as originally planned ‘ i ’ve calmed down now – i ’m a little less tense , ’ mrs @entity90 said			2
‘ i ’m not ashamed to say i was standing on @entity152 crying – i was ready to throw it in and go to bed at 4pm			0
’ ' i did n’t know how we were going to get up in the morning but the positivity has remained with the people around us			0
' with the couple 's credit cards now at their limits , they are not sure how they are going to survive on their honeymoon beyond the first few weeks			1
' we deliberately had an intimate wedding so we could go on a long holiday			2
now we do n't know how we are going to afford it , ' she said			2
' we had planned , prepared and structured the whole wedding to our budget but this was out of the ball park			2
' @entity53 contacted @entity10 on friday but a manager declined to comment			1
the blissfully happy couple before their day came crashing down around them			0
