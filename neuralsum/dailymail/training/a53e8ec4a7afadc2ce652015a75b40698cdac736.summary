by @entity0 with @entity2 out , @entity1 steps up to become leader of @entity4 , the first time the @entity6 team has ever been led by a non-brit at the @entity8			1
porte is a tough little @entity10 who is famous for marathon training rides , spending his 29th birthday this year , on 30 january , riding 403km - in one day			0
‘ whatever comes into @entity1 ’s head he says , ’ @entity2 has said			0
‘ @entity1 has no filter			0
he has had an up - and - down year but sir @entity38 , the @entity4 principal , said on the eve of the @entity40 has hit ‘ terrific form ’ at just the right time			1
as well as a great opportunity for @entity1 , @entity2 ’s exit could present @entity45 with a chance to shine			0
if @entity1 falters , the @entity47 could become team leader , not to target the podium , perhaps , but to try and bag stages and see how high he can finish on general classification			2
reassess : @entity4 's principal sir @entity38 has been forced to promote @entity1 to team leader opportunity : @entity47 @entity45 can now target stage wins after @entity2 's withdrawal fresh : @entity45 has never won a stage at the @entity20 but now has the opportunity to do so @entity32 falls as @entity60 wins again			1

@entity2 withdrew from @entity8 after crashing twice on stage five
@entity18 @entity1 will become @entity4 's first @entity8 team leader
@entity66 principal sir @entity38 says he is on ' terrific form '
@entity2 's exit also presents @entity70 with the opportunity to win stages at @entity8 should porte falter
