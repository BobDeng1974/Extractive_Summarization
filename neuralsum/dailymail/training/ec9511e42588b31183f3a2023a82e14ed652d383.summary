a group of retail stores including @entity13 , @entity14 and sir @entity16 's @entity15 of shops have said that a decision to apply sunday trading hours to the sunday before @entity20 would be ' ridiculous '			1
the stores have argued that sunday will be a crucial trading day this year as @entity20 falls on a tuesday and many people leave their shopping until the last minute			1
plea : retailers are pleading with the government to relax sunday trading laws on december 23 trader : supermarket giant @entity5 is among the high street names asking the government to relax sunday trading hours over @entity20 ( file picture ) relaxing the hours will leave stores less packed and make for a more pleasant shopping experience for customers , say the retailers			1
the trading laws were successfully relaxed during the @entity36 and @entity35 in @entity37 earlier this year			0
sir @entity16 told the @entity38 : ' extended trading in this instance would give a welcome boost to our high street retailers immediately prior to the biggest gift - giving day of the year			1
' a spokesman for supermarket giant @entity5 added : ' we know our customers appreciated the extra flexibility on a sunday around the @entity36 and would not be opposed to seeing this repeated , for example around @entity20			1
' beneficial : sir @entity16 , head of the @entity15 of stores , said that relaxing trading laws on december 23 would give retailers a welcome boost @entity6 's said that while it is not suggesting a permanent extension to sunday hours , it is backing a temporary relaxation for december 23 , while @entity57 have written to the government asking them for clarity on trading hours for that day			1
chief executive of the @entity64 's fourth largest supermarket chain @entity65 said that his company 's stores will see 2.5million customers through their doors in six hours between 10am and 6pm - the current sunday trading limits			0
he said : ' we 're not asking for 24 hour shopping - we 're only asking for an extra two or three hours			0
' a spokesman for the @entity74 said that the government will not be giving in to the retailer 's pleas			0
splurge : but researchers found presents only account for around half of the @entity20 spend parents are spending an average of £ 1,056.82 on their @entity20 shopping this year - working out as a hefty five per cent of their salary , a new study has revealed			1
leading online retailer @entity87 worked out that the combination of buying gifts for every member of the family and immediate friends was almost doubled by the ‘ @entity20 shopping experience ’ outlays such as parking , visiting @entity97 and food and drink			1
their poll showed the average parent intends on spending £ 551.28 on @entity20 presents this year , one third of which being allocated to their children and a further sixth to their own parents			2
. but despite the average present spend totalling £ 551.28 , it is in fact eight per cent down on last year - which a similar poll in 2011 calculated as being £ 592.26			0
yet @entity87 found the presents ’ cost was only half of the @entity20 spend - as 93 per cent of parents do not even factor into their budget the expense of impulse buys , travel , parking and petrol , and food and drink while out on the @entity125 , which worked out as an additional £ 505.54			2
with the average @entity64 parent expecting to shop seven times to gather all their gifting goods - these additional costs all add up			0
the additional costs of @entity20 present shopping ( during the entire festive period ) are @entity132 and drink - £ 178.78 ; travel and transport - £ 133.70 ; impulse buys - £ 110.67 ; @entity136 - £ 45.50 and @entity20 donations - £ 36.89 , making a total of £ 505.54			2
the £ 551.28 present spend added to the @entity20 shopping expenses cost of £ 505.54 makes an average @entity64 total of £ 1,056.82			2
coming out on top were those in @entity143 racking up a total of £ 1,173.43 , closely followed by those in @entity146 spending £ 1,158.05			0
other regional big spenders are @entity37 - £ 1,110.14 ; @entity148 - £ 1,009.27 and @entity150 - £ @entity149 , @entity151 at @entity87 , said : ' with pennies stretched this year , it ’s more important than ever for mums and dads to keep track of where their hard - earned cash is being spent			0
' additional extras can soon mount up without putting further strain on the gifting budget and with 24 days to go , the pressures of @entity20 for the nation ~ s mums are starting to be felt			1
' at @entity87 we want to help our customers make @entity20 as magical as possible with the ease and convenience of shopping from home and avoidance of hidden extras			2
' research - carried out by @entity172 in november 2012			0
- also found how much we spend on our relatives at @entity174 - for example £ 202.93 was being blown on our children ; £ 57.50 on mum ; £ 51.75 on dad ; £ 36.90 in total on our grandparents and £ 28.20 on our mother - in - law			0
the @entity182 last year revealed that the average full - time working female earns £ 22,900 per annum			0
so based on the average @entity64 mum spending £ 1056.82 on @entity20 shopping , it equates to five per cent of their annual income			2

retailers including @entity5 , @entity13 and sir @entity16 's @entity15 have called for opening hour *restrictions* to be relaxed two days before @entity20
sir @entity16 says that the move would bring a ' welcome boost ' to retailers
