but @entity11 and friends could still be affecting our views as adults			1
a study found that adults believe foods to be healthier if they were advertised by loveable cartoon characters when they were young			2
the researchers , from @entity20 ’s @entity19 , said that affectionate feelings for the likes @entity11 , the ‘ face ’ of @entity24 , endure for decades			1
as a result , we may believe the brands are healthier than they really are			1
@entity27 , of the @entity19 ’s @entity28 , said : ‘ people should check the labels of products they ’ve loved since childhood			2
‘ it ’s possible that affectionate feelings for brand characters mean they are overlooking relevant nutritional information			1
’ dr @entity27 began by asking almost 200 @entity38 adults how much they liked @entity11 and fellow @entity41 ’s mascot @entity39			1
@entity11 has featured in adverts for @entity24 since the early 1950s , while @entity44 the monkey only popped up in ads for @entity39 in the mid- 1980s			1
the volunteers were also asked how healthy they believed the products to be			2
results revealed that the older adults – who would have seen @entity11 but not @entity44 the monkey as children - believed the @entity24 to be better for them than the @entity39			1
however , younger adults , who would have seen both cartoon characters as children , rated the two cereals as being equally good for them			0
the study , published in the @entity57 , also found that older , but not younger adults , held the tiger in more affection than the monkey			0
further experiments showed that those with the fondest memories of cartoon characters resisted changing their minds			0
other cartoon characters featured in the study included @entity67 who has been used to promote the burger chain since the 1960s plus , a cartoon character ’s influence is not limited to the food that was originally advertised – with a familiar face helping boost the perceived health of another product made by the same brand			0

the researchers said that our ability to understand and evaluate advertising increase with age			2
as memories formed in childhood are particularly strong , adverts from that time may influence our beliefs for many years			0
dr @entity27 said : ‘ we suggest that parents discuss the persuasive nature of advertising with their children , and encourage them to develop critical thinking skills in response to advertising messages			0
‘ they may wish to point out that commercials use funny stories and exciting characters to entertain the viewer , but that commercials may not provide all the important information about the product			0
' for very young children , parents might want to limit the amount of advertising that their children see until the children are old enough to have these conversations			0

the researchers said that affectionate feelings for the likes @entity11 endure for decades
as a result people believe the brands are healthier than they really are
