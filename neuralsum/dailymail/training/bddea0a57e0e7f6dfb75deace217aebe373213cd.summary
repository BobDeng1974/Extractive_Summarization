his brother is ' sure ' he fled to @entity4 after the murder the brother of @entity7 has broken his silence to reveal he thinks the famous fugitive vanished to @entity4 and might still be alive			1
@entity10 said he was ' sure ' the elusive aristocrat fled to start a new life after murdering his children 's nanny @entity15 , 29 , in @entity16 , south west @entity17 in 1974			1
theories regarding the elusive earl , who would now be 76 , have been numerous and far - fetched over the 38 years he has been missing and he has been reportedly spotted in countries like @entity4 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
when mr @entity10 was asked if he thought his brother had escaped to @entity4 , he said : ' i 'm sure he did , yes			2
but what connection there is i do n't know '			2
but mr @entity10 moved to @entity4 to escape the media glare after his brother vanished and now lives in @entity31			2
speaking to the @entity32 , he said he did n't want to speculate on where his brother is or was and whether he was dead or alive			2
mr @entity10 , who apparently bears a striking resemblance to @entity7 , said the last contact he had with him was before the murder			2
many police officers involved in the case believe he fled the country with the help of his wealthy friends			2
others have suggested he committed suicide but no body has ever been found			2
however , @entity7 's wife @entity44 , believes her husband died the day after the murder by jumping off a ferry			1
the 72 - year - old widow , who lives as a virtual recluse at her home in @entity17 , rubbished claims he fled to @entity4 saying ' it does not make sense '			2
public face : @entity7 , pictured with his then fiancee @entity55 , disappeared in november 1974 she said he was ' not the sort of @entity58 to cope abroad ' , adding that he could n't speak foreign languages and ' preferred @entity58 food			2
' the revelations follow a @entity63 report on @entity64 this week where a former personal assistant to @entity7 ’s friend , casino - owner and zoo - keeper @entity68 , claimed that not only was the peer living in @entity4 in the early @entity70 , but he also saw his children on at least two occasions			1
the woman , named in the programme as @entity75 , says she arranged travel tickets for @entity7 ’s eldest two children to travel to @entity78 and then to @entity79 , where ‘ their father would observe them ... just to see how they were growing up ’			1
@entity7 was officially declared dead by the @entity84 in 1999 the @entity86 aristocrat was famously smuggled out of the country following the death of @entity15 - the family 's nanny - in 1974			1
@entity7 , born @entity7 in 1934 , was officially declared dead by the @entity84 in 1999			2
he started gambling early in life and learned how to play poker during his national service years			0
in 1955 , he got a job with a small merchant bank , @entity95 , for £ 500 a year			0
however , he retired in 1960 having won £ 26,000 over two nights playing ' chemin de fer ' at a gambling party run by @entity68			0
but he would eventually accrue huge debts , before disappearing following ms @entity15 's death			1
every few years , @entity7 is ' spotted ' again - sometimes in @entity24 , sometimes in @entity4 , sometimes in the @entity86			0
however , mr @entity10 said he had no knowledge of that and admitted he has ' never really been in touch with them '			0
he said he is often asked to speak about the case but chooses not to			0
lady @entity44 , wife of @entity7 pictured in 1994 @entity7 had three children with @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity106 , who lost custody of the children in 1982 following a breakdown , said it was ' ridiculous ' to suggest the children went abroad and said she would have known if they had			1
she also questioned why the woman claims only @entity107 and @entity108 went abroad and not @entity109			0
she said her husband would have wanted to see all three children , whom she is no longer in touch with			1
meanwhile , this week an antiques dealer came across what he claims must be @entity7 's watch which is believed to have come from @entity4			1
@entity122 , 58 , believes the watch with a chunky black strap which he bought last week from another dealer for £ 5,000 could hold vital clues as to what happened to @entity7			1
the other dealer claims that it was discovered in a @entity4 township			0
inscribed on the underside of the watch is the message : ' presented to @entity135 " the @entity136 ' by his friends at the @entity137 december 1967 '			0
after some digging , mr @entity122 found photographs of the aristocrat wearing a similar watch			0
the discovery supports claims that the fugitive fled to @entity4 , where some believe he is still living			0
@entity15 's body was found in the basement of @entity7 's @entity16 house at 9.45pm , @entity106 , in great distress , burst into the @entity151 ’s arms , the pub near her home in the exclusive area of @entity16 in central @entity17			1
with blood streaming from several wounds on her head , she cried : ‘ help me , help me , help me ! he ’s in the house ! he ’s murdered my nanny ! ’ @entity106 , who was estranged from her husband , said he had killed their nanny and tried to kill her			1
police found the couple ’s three children asleep in their beds , unharmed , and when they went to the basement they were greeted by a macabre scene			1
the basement lightbulb had been removed , but in the semi-darkness , officers made out a pool of blood with a man ’s footprint in it ( a bloodied towel was in a bathroom ) , a blood - stained length of lead piping and a mailbag containing a body			0
the body was that of @entity15 , the children ’s live - in - nanny , who was the same height and build as @entity106			1
according to @entity106 — living apart from her husband and in a bitter custody dispute over their children — she ’d gone into the house to look for the nanny , but was attacked by her husband , whom she recognised by his voice , before managing to flee			1
when she returned with police , @entity7 was gone			0
after the attack , he went to the home of friends , telling them he had found the nanny had been murdered			1
he left his friends at 1.15am			0
three days later his car was found abandoned in @entity201 , @entity202 , with bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the @entity16 basement			0
there was speculation that he had committed suicide , but no body was found			0
and there were rumours that his gambling friends @entity68 and billionaire @entity216 had helped him flee the country two years later , @entity68 gave an interview in which he said that if @entity7 had sought his help he would have given it unconditionally			0
