by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:34 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 03:16 est , 6 september 2012 the staggering extent to which high street bank staff chasing bonuses and commission are routinely ripping off customers was laid bare in a scathing report yesterday			1
at the same time , the @entity8 can reveal that 40 per cent of staff at @entity10 earn extra payments if customers are persuaded to buy additional financial products			1
they get bonuses if they can entice millions of loyal account holders to fork out for costly insurance policies or ' premium ' current accounts which charge a monthly fee			2
probe : @entity10 is facing further investigation and a possible penalty following an @entity22 investigation into ' dysfunctional ' incentive schemes in the banking sector separately , in a report by the @entity22 regulator , published yesterday , account holders were said to be viewed only as ' sales targets ' exploited by ' pile it high and sell it quick ' tactics that verge on the criminal			1
banks were told to clean up their act or face a major clampdown			2
the @entity22 's report into the incentive payments has brought another day of shame for @entity41 's financial industry			1
it revealed that one firm has been referred to its enforcement and @entity45			0
sources named the bank as @entity10 , which is 41 per cent owned by the taxpayer			1
@entity49 : @entity22 boss @entity50 says : ' financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to ' ruthless salesmen were said to be so desperate to meet sales targets that they even sell to family members such as their elderly mothers or sisters			1
others were found guilty of colluding to ' intentionally overcharge ' a customer to trigger a bonus payout			2
the report said that some firms pay a ' @entity67 ' of up to £ 10,000 to the first 21 workers who meet a sales target			0
in other cases , staff are not paid a basic salary , which means their own financial survival depends on their ability to sell , a situation the report warned ' significantly ' increased the risk of mis - selling			1
yesterday @entity50 , of the @entity22 , said : ' some time ago , financial institutions changed their view of consumers from people to serve , to people to sell to			1
' he read the riot act to the industry – which also includes insurers and investment firms – telling companies to ' clean up their act ' or face a clampdown in the next 12 to 18 months			1
firms can continue to pay commission , but such payments must benefit the customer , not the salesmen			0
' it has been too easy , for too long , for those selling or giving advice to be motivated solely by the rewards on offer to them , rather than how to enrich their customer , ' he said			0
' we all know what it is like to walk into a bank to do something simple , like paying a credit card bill , only for the person behind the counter to ask if you would like to extend your credit , take out more insurance or look at their competitive mortgage rates ? ' he warned some of the mis - selling was ' very close to fraud , which is a criminal offence '			1
crackdown : @entity22 says cultural change is needed and chief executives at top banks are ultimately accountable for the way their staff are incentivised the scale of the mis - selling is shocking in an industry which provides products essential to the lives of millions			1
of the 22 firms investigated by the @entity22 between september 2010 and september 2011 , 20 were found to have ' features in their incentive schemes that increased the risk of mis - selling '			1
the report highlights one salesman ' blatantly misleading ' a customer to scoop £ 1,000			0
in another case , two salesmen ' colluded to intentionally overcharge ' a customer because the bonus was linked to the amount that the client had agreed to pay for the product			0
yesterday the @entity148 criticised the @entity22 for being ' slow to respond ' to a problem which has existed for decades			1
chairman @entity150 said : ' the regulator has made a commitment to change the industry 's behaviour			0
we hope that this time the industry will get the message and not try to find a way to get around the rules as they have done in the past			0
' @entity10 said it had made significant changes to its incentive schemes this year , adding : ' today these schemes reward staff for providing high quality customer service , assessed by a wide range of metrics			1
' but it confirmed that around 40,000 of its 100,000 staff were eligible for incentive schemes			1
on serving customers : ' why is it that every time i walk into the bank to do something simple , like pay my credit card bill , the person behind the counter asks me if i would like to extend my credit , take out more insurance or look at their competitive mortgage rates ? ' when did this happen ? banks for me used to be a service – a place where you would go in , stand in a queue , have a pleasant chat with the clerk and go about your daily business			2
some time ago , this changed – financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to			1
' on why selling financial products is different from flogging fast food or @entity204 : ' this is not like when you go to a fast food restaurant and the server asks ‘ do you want fries with that ? ’ , or ‘ do you want to go large ? ’			2
we all know they ask these questions because they are encouraged to make the most of every sale , and when customers are standing at the counter , they are more likely to say yes			2
but then we also know what to expect – chiefly lots of salt , calories and a bigger waistline			0
' but far fewer of us actually have such a clear understanding of financial services			2
we also mostly trust those selling or giving advice to be acting in our best interests			0
' these are often complex and long - term products that turn into long - term problems if they go wrong			0
' the cost of going large may cost us a few pence – the cost of buying the wrong mortgage could see you lose your home			0
' and while it is annoying that when you buy a tv they only seem interested in selling you the warranty , that is nothing compared to trying to find a safe home for your money , only for the person in the bank to only seem interested in selling you a confusing product that could put your life savings at risk			0
' on changing culture at the top : ' firms need to change how they incentivise their staff and learn to manage their risks			2
ceos are ultimately accountable for the way their staff are incentivised , so we expect them to take a real interest in fixing this			0
recurring problems need to be investigated , action taken and redress paid to consumers who have lost out			0
' i want to draw a line in the sand here			0

a probe into banks ' incentive schemes uncovered ' serious ' failings at @entity10 , which now faces further investigation and a potential penalty
the investigation by the @entity22 found 22 banks , building *societies* and insurers were incentivising staff to mis - sell
it found staff were given huge bonuses and others were lying and cheating customers for cash
new @entity22 boss @entity50 says the culture has to stop within 18 months
' financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to , ' he said
