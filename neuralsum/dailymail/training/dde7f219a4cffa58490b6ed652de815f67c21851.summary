as controversy grows over the regrading of @entity4 examinations , thousands of people have started sharing their own scores on social networks to put future generations at ease			1
well - known figures have been conspicuously quiet about their results , however , but with the likes of @entity14 , @entity11 and @entity12 reportedly getting close to a perfect 1600 , perhaps they felt they 'd only add pressure rather than ease it			1
famous faces with far lower sat scores include @entity18 , who got a score lower than 500 , @entity21 actress @entity20 , believed to have scored around 800 , and even former @entity23 president @entity22 , whose 1020 puts him a few hundred points below successor @entity25			1
brains : @entity27 ( left ) admitted to ' feeling like a big dummy ' with her score of 1080 , but that result actually puts her above the @entity23 average			1
@entity12 ( right ) reportedly got close to a perfect 1600 awkward : even former @entity23 president @entity22 scored fairly low - with results of 1020 puts him more than 200 points below successor @entity25 's 1206 @entity27 admitted to ' feeling like a big dummy ' when she confirmed her score of 1080 , but that result actually puts her above the @entity23 average			1
with rumoured scores of 1579 , 1500 and 1150 , actor @entity11 , singer ke $ ha and actress @entity39 would also be placed far above average			1
as you 'd probably expect , @entity42 co-founders @entity41 and @entity43 got sky - high 1590 and a perfect 1600 respectively , with @entity47 's @entity46 also scoring a perfect 800 on the maths section of the examination			1
@entity50 and @entity51 have both admitted getting ' very high ' sat scores in the past but neither has revealed the exact number , while the @entity55 has previously reported that actor @entity56 ' had near perfect sat scores in high school '			1
talent : @entity50 has admitted getting ' very high ' sat scores in the past but has n't revealed the exact number			1
it has previously been reported that actor @entity56 ' had near perfect sat scores in high school ' numbers : with 1100 , actress @entity39 ( left ) would also be placed far above average			1
sadly for @entity21 star @entity20 ( right ) , her rumoured score of only 800 would see her fall short of that mark star : @entity69 and songwriter ke $ ha is believed to have received a score of around 1500 on her sat exams meanwhile talk show host @entity74 , political commentator @entity76 and actor and economist @entity77 picked up near - perfect scores of 1530 , 1585 and 1573 respectively			1
it 's not just conservatives with high scores though : @entity83 kept the tally high for the @entity86 camp with a score of 1355			2
@entity23 president @entity89 , on the other hand , has repeatedly refused to release his education records			0
not all celebrities fared brilliantly however , with presenter @entity92 rumoured to have picked up a low 870 , and baseball star @entity93 reaching just 910			0
meanwhile stand - up comedian @entity94 is thought to have scored around 950			0
as part of the sweeping changes with the sat examinations , essays will become optional and there will no longer be penalties for wrong answers			1
. changes in the annual test that millions of students take will also do away with some vocabulary words such as ' prevaricator ' and ' sagacious ' in favor of words more commonly used in school and on the job			2
@entity112 officials said wednesday the update — the first since 2005 — is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward			1
the test should offer ' worthy challenges , not artificial obstacles , ' said @entity112 president @entity124 at an announcement event in @entity126 , @entity127			0
smart : @entity47 co-founder @entity46 scored a perfect 800 on the maths section of the examination intelligent : as you 'd probably expect , @entity42 co-founders @entity41 and @entity43 got sky - high 1590 and a perfect 1600 respectively the new exam will be rolled out in 2016 , so this year 's ninth graders will be the first to take it , in their junior year			1
the new sat will continue to test reading , writing and math skills , with an emphasis on analysis			2
scoring will return to a 1,600 - point scale last used in 2004 , with a separate score for the optional essay			2
for the first time , students will have the option of taking the test on computers			0
one of the biggest changes is that the extra penalty for wrong answers , which discouraged guessing , will be eliminated			0
and some vocabulary words will be replaced with words such as ' synthesis ' and ' empirical ' that are used more widely in classrooms and in work settings			0
@entity124 said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of @entity4 words currently have one recourse : drilling with flashcards			1
he said educators know that flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts , but ' when the @entity4 rolls around they become the royal road			2
students stop reading and start flipping			0
' the essay will be changed in other ways , too			0
it will measure students ' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument , instead of measuring the coherence of the writing but not the quality or accuracy of the reasoning			0
it will be up to school districts and colleges the students apply to as to whether the essay will be required			0
each exam will include a passage drawn from ' founding documents ' such as the @entity189 or from discussions they 've inspired			0
new measurement : essays will no longer be compulsory and wrong answers will not be penalized in the exams instead of testing a wide range of math concepts , the new exam will focus on a few areas , like algebra , deemed most needed for college and life afterward			2
a calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions , instead of on the entire math portion			0
a longstanding criticism of the sat is that students from wealthier households do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes			2
the @entity112 seeks to defuse that by saying it will partner with the nonprofit @entity212 to provide free test preparation materials for the redesigned sat. it also says every income - eligible student who takes the @entity4 will receive four fee waivers to apply for college , which continues an effort the @entity112 has had to assist low - income students			2
these are the first @entity4 upgrades since 2005 when the essay portion was added and analogy questions were removed			1
there have been other notable changes to the test , such as in 1994 when antonym questions were removed and calculators were allowed for the first time			2
the test was first used in 1926			0
the sat was taken last year by 1.7 million students			0
it has historically been more popular on the coasts , while the other popular standardized college entrance exam , the @entity235 , dominated the central @entity23 but the @entity235 overtook the sat in overall use in 2012 , in part because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of the states ' testing regimen			0
last year , the @entity235 said it would begin offering computer - based testing in 2015 .			0
