by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:58 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 9 march 2013 prison : @entity3 now works as a solicitor at @entity5 where he was sentenced for robbery in 1993 a man jailed for his part in an armed robbery is now working as a senior lawyer in the very court where he was sent down , sparking an extraordinary legal row			1
the criminal - turned - solicitor was even asked by one of his robbery co-defendants to act for him in a subsequent sex assault case			1
@entity3 , 42 , was jailed for seven years for his role in a raid in which staff at a @entity21 branch were threatened by masked thugs wielding a gun and a knife			1
mr @entity25 , the getaway driver , waited outside in a car while two other gang members burst into the branch at @entity28 near @entity5			2
but despite his conviction for robbery in 1993 , @entity3 has been allowed to qualify as a solicitor after his release from prison – and now works in the same @entity34 @entity5 where he was sentenced			1
the lawyer insisted yesterday he had been completely open about his past with the @entity38 , the solicitors ’ professional body , before he qualified as a lawyer in 2005			0
but @entity42 has learnt that his career change has sparked astonishment in legal circles			0
concerns were laid bare when one of mr @entity3 ’s former co-defendants in the robbery , @entity50 , who wielded the knife , applied to have the lawyer help defend him on a sex assault charge			1
court records from 2011 – which can only now be published – reveal that @entity34 @entity57 ’s senior judge , @entity56 , blocked @entity50 ’s application for legal aid for the defence work because he was ‘ extremely concerned ’ about the arrangement			0
the request was eventually allowed on appeal , but only after another judge appeared to make clear his surprise that the lawyer could represent his former co-defendant			0
mr @entity25 last night said that one of his law firm ’s colleagues – not himself – went on to act for @entity50 , who was jailed for four years last august after being convicted on two counts of sexual assault			1
in a statement yesterday , mr @entity25 said : ‘ with regard to my conviction some 20 years ago , i can only reiterate how deeply sorry and ashamed i still am for my actions			2
i was rightly punished and have since tried my utmost to make amends			0
surprise : news of @entity3 's previous conviction was said to be the talk of the robing room at @entity84 , @entity85 ‘ i disclosed my previous conviction to the @entity38 well before my admission to the roll of solicitors			1
i have been a solicitor for some eight years and have an exemplary record of professional conduct			2
’ in a statement , the @entity38 said that a criminal conviction was not a complete bar to practise in every instance			0
a spokesman added : ‘ @entity97 would have looked closely at all the facts before allowing entry to the profession			0
’ but one fellow @entity34 lawyer expressed his surprise at the situation , saying : ‘ this is the talk of the robing room in the court			0
‘ there is surprise that someone with such a serious offence can be working as a solicitor - advocate in court – especially the same one he was sent down in			2

42 - year - old sentenced for robbery in 1993 at @entity84
