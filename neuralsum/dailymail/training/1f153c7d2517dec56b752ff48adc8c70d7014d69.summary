scientists have sent a ‘ mental message ’ from one person to another 4,000 miles away in what they claim is the world ’s first successful telepathy experiment			2
they connected one person in @entity7 , @entity8 , to a wireless headset linked to the internet , and another person to a similar device in @entity13			1
when the first person merely thought of a greeting such as ‘ ciao ’ , @entity19 for ‘ hello ’ , the recipient in @entity15 was aware of the thought occurring , according to a report in the journal @entity23			1
the experiment was carried out by experts from @entity42 , who claim it shows technology can be used to transmit information from one person ’s brain to another			2
@entity49 , a theoretical physicist and co-author of the research , said : ‘ it is kind of technological realization of the dream of telepathy , but it is definitely not magical			0
‘ we are using technology to interact electromagnetically with the brain			0
’ @entity42 neurology professor and research co-author @entity59 said they wanted to see if they could use ‘ existing pathways ’ to find out if ‘ one could communicate directly between two people by reading out the brain activity from one person and injecting brain activity into the second person ’			1
science or science fiction ? telepathy is common in fantasy characters including @entity74 's prof @entity73 ( centre ) ‘ one such pathway is , of course , the internet , so our question became , “ could we develop an experiment that would bypass the talking or typing part of internet and establish direct brain - to - brain communication ? ”			1
’ extra care was taken to make sure no sensory information got in the way that could have influenced the interpretation of the message , the researchers said			0
dr @entity49 added : ‘ we hope that in the longer term this could radically change the way we communicate with each other			0
’ the concept is being developed to help create prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the mind .			0

study in journal @entity23 connected people in @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity13
both wore high - tech electromagnetic headsets connected over the internet
first person thought of a greeting and second reported ' flashes of light '
