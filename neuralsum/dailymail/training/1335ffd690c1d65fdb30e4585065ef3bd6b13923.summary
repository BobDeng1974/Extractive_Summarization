by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 05:13 est , 4 august 2012 extra staff have been hired , opening hours extended and the streets decked in @entity3 – but the @entity5 tourism boom has failed to materialise			1
attractions , retailers , restaurants and theatres are reporting a disastrous drop in custom			1
normally the summer holidays would see long queues outside sites such as the @entity15 , @entity16 , the @entity17 and the @entity18			0
@entity19 : flags may be out for the @entity5 but the normally bustling pavements of this prime shopping street were almost empty yesterday this year , amid dire warnings of chaos on the @entity26 and gridlock on the roads , the once busy streets seem more like a ghost town			0
the evidence of these pictures contradicts culture secretary @entity32 , who this week dismissed complaints of a fall in trade as ‘ absolute nonsense ’			1
in fact , he insisted : ‘ i think anyone who has a business anywhere in @entity18 is frankly quids in			1
’ tourism industry leaders blame the government and @entity42 for exaggerating the difficulties of getting around during the @entity5			1
a government edict that civil servants would be allowed to work from home for weeks on end to escape the chaos that never arrived fuelled the sense of panic			1
in reality , the warnings have backfired , leaving many businesses seriously out of pocket and now forced to take emergency measures			0
@entity58 stores , which had extended opening hours and taken on extra staff , have decided to fund a six - figure advertising campaign to woo shoppers back into @entity18			1
leading attractions are handing out leaflets to those visiting the olympic park , and restaurants are running hundreds of discounts			1
visitor numbers to the @entity15 are down by around 50 per cent compared to a year ago – a drop that is thought to have been mirrored across other attractions			2
on the rack : the queues have disappeared , and visitor numbers are down by 50 per cent attractions such as the @entity15 , above , are usually magnets for tourists at this time of year a spokesman for @entity77 , the independent charity which runs the @entity15 as well as @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and the @entity81 in @entity82 , said : ‘ overall the visitor figures across the palaces for the week ending july 29 are down 52 per cent on last year			2
’ restaurant takings in central @entity18 are down by an average of 40 per cent , while @entity88 has also suffered			0
bosses at @entity90 , the world ’s second largest theme park company , which runs @entity16 , the @entity18 , the @entity17 and the @entity93 in the @entity5 sailing venue of @entity95 , have been bitterly disappointed by the fall in visitor numbers			2
it had extended the opening hours of the @entity18 from 9pm until midnight , however the expected flood of people has not materialised			0
a spokesman said : ‘ undoubtedly the level of early @entity45 warnings telling people to stay out of the capital and other @entity5 locations like @entity95 have significantly impacted normal visitation patterns			0
’ @entity90 has introduced a two - for - one ticket offer on its leading @entity18 attractions to try to boost trade			2
bare : an empty @entity111 shopping centre at @entity112 this week the company was among businesses which took part in an emergency summit organised by @entity18 mayor @entity117 where it was agreed that there would be a new public relations and marketing initiative designed to entice people to ‘ come back ’ to @entity18			0
@entity124 , a retail analyst from the @entity125 , said : ‘ there is no doubt that the @entity5 , far from providing a boost to @entity18 retailers , are detracting from the traditional shopping hubs in the @entity58			0
’ but he predicted that the impact of the new advertising campaign would be ‘ marginal ’ , adding : ‘ retailers must hope that consumers drift back after realising that @entity18 is not as overcrowded as expected			0
