by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 30 may 2013 a chemical usually associated with how happy we feel could also play a pivotal role in our sexual preferences , researchers have discovered			2
a @entity7 team found that blocking serotonin , known as the brain 's ' happy chemical ' caused female mice to switch their sexual preferences			1
it is the first time that sexual preference has been reversed in animals without sex hormones			2
researchers found that when they blocked the serotonin receptors in female mice , their sexual preferences switched and they tried to mount other females @entity21 , also known as 5 - hydroxytryptamine , is a neurotransmitter - a chemical substance that transmits nerve impulses across the space between nerve cells or neurons			1
it plays an important part in the regulation of learning , mood , sleep and helps control blood vessels			0
it has also been linked to anxiety , migraine , vomiting and appetite			0
@entity41 of @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity7 , and his colleagues genetically engineered female mice so that they could no longer make or respond to serotonin			1
' female mouse mutants lacking either central serotonergic neurons or serotonin prefer female over male genital odors when given a choice , and displayed increased female â€“ female mounting when presented either with a choice of a male and a female target or only with a female target , ' the team wrote in their paper , which is published in the journal @entity60			0
although the research was carried out in mice , serotonin works in the same way in human brains ' our results indicate that serotonin controls sexual preference , ' they say			1
' it 's possible that the well - known effect of early sex hormone levels on partner preference and the serotonin mechanism described here are completely independent mechanisms , ' @entity69 of @entity70 told @entity78			0
' in other words , serotonin systems may be part of the cascade of signals that translate sex hormone levels during development into sexual partner preference in adulthood			0

@entity7 researchers found blocking serotonin in female mice caused them to prefer *sniffing* and mounting females
researchers believe the chemical could be part of ' chemical chain ' that determines our sexual preference
