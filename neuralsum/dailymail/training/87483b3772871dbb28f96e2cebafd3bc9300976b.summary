by @entity0 @entity1 , a leading economist at @entity2 , is being sued by a wealthy heiress a wealthy heiress has sued a baron and a leading economist after she sunk $ 77 million into their research company - which she claims is now all but worthless			1
@entity10 - @entity9 says she is ‘ stunned ’ that her private banker , baron @entity11 , gave her bad investment advice while she was still grieving over the death of her mother			1
in a recently - filed lawsuit she says that she was fooled into investing in @entity17 - based @entity16 because it could supposedly change the properties of matter			1
but after the breakthrough failed to happen she now wants her money back - and has gone to the courts to do so			2
she has sued @entity24 , @entity27 bank @entity25 and , in an unexpected twist , former @entity30 administrator and @entity16 co-founder @entity31 and @entity2 ’s @entity1 , one of the college ’s most respected economists , who also sits on the firm ’s board			1
among the allegations is that during their nine year business relationship , @entity37 paid @entity11 $ 18.5 million in shares and an annual consulting fee of around $ 500,000			1
now friends have told the @entity43 that she was treated shabbily and that what happened was ‘ very reprehensible ’			0
@entity46 von der @entity45 , a venture capitalist based in @entity47 who knows the main parties , said : ‘ it ’s very sad it had to come to this			2
‘ it did n’t start that way			0
she was definitely taken advantage of			0
’ the row dates back to 2002 when @entity37 ’s mother died and she discovered she had been left hundreds of millions of dollars of stocks in pharmaceutical giant @entity58			1
she knew @entity11 ’s wife socially so turned to him for financial advice			1
as she struggled with her loss , she was also reassured by the fact he worked for @entity25 , a 200 - year - old institution that once served queen @entity65			2
over the next nine years together , @entity11 told @entity37 to diversify her holdings so she sold some of her shares and bought into @entity16 and related companies			1
@entity10 - @entity9 is suing her private banker baron @entity71 , who worked at @entity25 ( pictured ) , over his alleged bad investment advice the company seeks to change the properties of things e.g. magnetizing copper so that it becomes more conductive and can be used in computer circuit boards			1
in the lawsuit , @entity37 says she was told @entity16 was just six months away from releasing its first product			1
on visits to its head office she was also told the company was valued at $ 500 million but says now that figure was ‘ grossly overstated ’			0
and she supposedly grew so close to @entity85 that he would let her stay at his house and took her to a country club to make a good impression on her			0
the lawsuit states that @entity31 ‘ assured her that the investments were not risky and told @entity37 that the investments would be profitable ’			0
the money she invested was not just in @entity16 but related companies as well , such as $ 25 million cash and a $ 15 million loan into @entity85 ’s @entity98 another $ 5million of her money went into another of @entity85 ’s companies which tried to convert waste into gas but has now gone bankrupt			2
@entity105 ’s lawyers argue that over the course of his nine - year relationship with @entity37 he made 32 investments on her behalf and that only three of them are in dispute			2
but the lawsuit paints a very different story and alleges that he ‘ preyed on @entity37 ’s grief and known inexperience ’ with money			0
@entity17 - based @entity16 is working on changing the properties of matter according to the @entity43 , had @entity37 left her money where it was - in @entity58 stock - it would now be worth $ 80 million			1
she still however has significant wealth and is not on the breadline			0
@entity125 said in a statement : ‘ i was advised by my bank and one of its senior officers that i needed a diverse , conservative investment portfolio that would provide security for my family			0
‘ my trust was bolstered by the professional reputations of the people behind these investments : i believe anyone would have trusted the advice of @entity1 , a world - class @entity2 economist			1
i am stunned by how this all turned out			2
’ mr @entity1 , the bishop william lawrence university professor at @entity2 , declined to comment and referred questions to @entity85			1
mr @entity31 said in a statement : ‘ i am deeply offended by ms von @entity10 ’s allegations and deny them wholeheartedly			0
‘ i have given my best to every company i have been associated with , and have always put shareholder interests ’ first			0
’ @entity125 ’s claim against @entity25 is that is did not manage her money better and did not keep sufficient checks on @entity24			0
bank spokesman @entity153 said : ' we categorically reject the accusations that have been made against @entity25			0
