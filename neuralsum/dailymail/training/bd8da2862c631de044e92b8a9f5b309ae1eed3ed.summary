by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 03:36 est , 26 november 2012 a mining enthusiast has built his very own 150ft ironstone mine replica in his back garden			1
@entity5 has spent 13 years making the perfect 19th century model in the farmland at his home in @entity10 , @entity11			1
despite being located just 15 feet underground , the mine deceptively feels as if it is hundreds of metres below the surface			1
labour of love : for the past 13 years , @entity5 has been building a 1840s @entity17 mine at the bottom of his garden the depths : the mine is only 15ft deep but feels like it 's much farther under the earth blackness : the 68 - year - old thought up the idea after moving to @entity28 , which was once home to over 100 iron mines , producing over 444,000 tonnes of iron every year between the 1880s to the 1930s the 68 - year - old thought up the idea after moving to the @entity28 area , a part of the country which was once home to over 100 iron mines , producing over 444,000 tons of iron every year between the 1880s to the 1930s			1
thousands of men and boys were employed to work as miners , making it a vital national industry			2
@entity44 , a painter , said : ' the mine is as close to a 100 per cent replica of a @entity17 mine as you will find			2
' i moved in here 15 years ago - the house is a barn conversion with a conventional garden but plenty of land			2
' having moved from out of the area , i started to become interested in local history and this part of the world is notorious for its mining background			0
' i began talking to an unemployed local lad and we both shared an interest in medieval ruins			0
' accurate : the mine was mostly built using salvaged authentic materials that @entity44 scoured the region for tunnel : many of the fixings in the structure were actually used in mines he added : ' i visited a mine nearby in @entity74 , and it was an experience i will never forget			1
' but it made me want to preserve @entity28 's identity so , as you do , i decided to dig up the garden ! ' @entity44 embedded two shafts into an embankment and installed a headstock tower - where men and ironstone would be lifted in an out of the mine			1
he also fitted a headstock for the upcast shaft that allows the mine to be ventilated and allows a small amount of light into the ground below			2
underground , he dug up the land using a @entity94 and built subterranean mine workings - a narrow gauge where a railed tramway led to a tippler staith and tubs of ironstone from the mine were tipped into the carts below			1
the whole operation is ventilated to ensure water does not get in and flood the underground area			0
his latest addition to the model mine is a lamp house , situated on the ground above , which draws air into the mine and would have been where lamps were cleaned and prepared ready to take down into the pit			2
left for @entity44 to complete is a mine office , which will be built close to @entity44 's house			1
@entity44 said : ' i have spent 13 years completing the mine but i want it to look authentic , like it 's from the 1840s			1
into the daylight : @entity44 extensively researched the iron industry of @entity28 for the mammoth undertaking echoes of history : @entity44 said : ' i want it to look abandoned , as if miners have just up and left ' structure : @entity44 still has to build a mine office , which will be close to his house ' i want it to look abandoned , as if miners have just up and left			1
' i believe it 's the only one of its type in the country			2
' ' i 've loved every minute building it and there 's never been a point where i 've said to myself , i 'm sick of this			2
' it will be very interesting for anyone interested in history and ironstone mining			0
' @entity44 has used all reclaimed materials to build the mine , collecting them from local builders , scrapyards and local markets to make it as authentic as possible			0
he said : ' everything is an exact version of what was in the smaller old mines			0
' i 've consulted experts , used my own knowledge of ironstone mines and read lots of old books to get everything accurate			0
' it 's a very green project - i 've also planted wild flowers and plants , and hope to attract natural wildlife and birds to the site			0
' built next to the roman road , ' @entity168 ' , @entity44 is hoping his project will help put @entity28 back on the mining map and act as a tribute to those who worked on them			1
track : these rails ( left ) were used to transport carts laden with ore			0
the shaft is ventilated for safety ( right ) deep : @entity44 's recreation has with two minehead shafts , a narrow gauge tramway and 150ft of subterranean mine tunnelling he said : ' i 've had potash miners visit whose fathers were in the ironstone mines and they say it 's just like the real thing			1
' there 's no memorial like this to the ironstone miners of @entity28			1
' and without @entity28 's ironstone , there would be no @entity11 steel industry as we know it today			1
' he hopes that people with an interest will come and see how an iron mine used to run , first - hand			0
he said : ' it 's lots of fun			0
in my mind i ca n't spend an afternoon inside when there 's exciting things to do outside			0
@entity44 , describes himself as single , but is still hoping for a young lady who would like to share a ruin in a nature reserve			0
he is prepared to welcome organised groups if they want a free tour of his site .			0

@entity5 spent 13 years on the amazing structure
the 15ft deep mine is as ' accurate as possible
he built it as a tribute to @entity28 's miners of yesteryear
