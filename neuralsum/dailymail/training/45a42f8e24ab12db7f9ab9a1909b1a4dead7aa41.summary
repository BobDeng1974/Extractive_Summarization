blame hormones , upbringing or plain old stereotyping , but there are some character traits that are always associated with either men or women			1
acting on intuition , sobbing your heart out at a weepy film or thinking through a problem from someone else 's point of view are all traditionally feminine tendencies			1
angry outbursts and a pathological inability to ask for directions , even when lost , are most definitely linked to the male brain			2
but far from just being crass gender generalisations , it now seems that there is solid science behind the different ways in which the sexes behave			2
women have more brain cells in the pre-frontal cortex , the area which controls planning and conscientiousness , which is why they are better at packing carefully after studying nearly 80,000 brain scans and analysing numerous research papers , my work as a neuroscientist has helped find scientific proof that male and female brains are fundamentally different			1
huge advances in brain scanning mean that scientists are now able get an incredibly clear picture of which parts of the brain light up when we do certain things			2
this has helped prove that the differences between our brains can explain our behaviour in a multitude of ways			2
men and women are equally smart , but each sex uses different parts of the brain to solve problems or achieve goals			2
so , what is really happening inside our heads ? size matters studies show that men 's brains are between eight and ten per cent larger than women 's , and even if you adjust for body weight male brains contain around four per cent more brain cells than female brains			1
but this does n't mean that men are brighter			2
in fact , brain scans show that some very important parts of the female brain are larger than the corresponding part of a man 's			1
this has big implications for the different ways men and women typically behave			2
women behave differently to men because their brains are wired completely uniquely if you 've ever wondered why it 's so often the woman who organises and usually packs for a family holiday , it 's because women have more brain cells in the pre-frontal cortex - the area of the brain which controls judgement , planning , and conscientiousness			1
this is also the part of the brain that governs impulse control , which may explain why women tend to think before they leap - sometimes not leaping at all - while men are more inclined to jump in and think about it later			2
one reason men can be more volatile and swift to anger in a crisis is that the part of their brain , the amygdala , which processes fear and anger , is much larger than a woman 's			1
luckily , they have fewer brain cells in the major memory centre of the brain , which means any outburst is quickly forgotten - by them , at least			2
good spatial awareness is also widely regarded to be a male thing and for good reason			0
boys are born with larger parietal lobes , which deal with perception of the physical world around them			0
it is probably no surprise to learn that men have more brain cells in the hypothalamus , too - the part of the brain which focuses on sexual behaviour			0
one reason men can be more volatile and swift to anger in a crisis is that the part of their brain , the amygdala , which processes fear and anger , is much larger than a woman 's multi-tasking minds the human brain is made up of grey matter ( brain cells ) that does the thinking , and white matter ( the communication cables between brain cells ) , which connects different bits of the brain			1
studies now show that grey and white matter are differently distributed in men and women , which has massive implications for the way we behave			0
because men have more grey matter in the bit of the brain that governs intelligence , they are inclined to tackle a task with single - minded focus , not taking into account the peripheral issues which a woman might consider to be important			0
women have more white matter in the part of the brain that governs intelligence			0
this means chatter goes on between different parts of the brain , which is why when women tackle a problem , they draw on many areas at the same time			0
science proves that women have far more cells in the part of the brain that controls empathy , which explains why they cry more often in sad movies @entity187 there is something unique about the structure and functioning of the female brain which gives women a distinct advantage when it comes to intuition			0
scans show that when women are thinking , they dip into the right side of the brain , which specialises in emotional issues			0
this makes women much better at picking up on cues , such as body language or tone of voice , that men may miss. scans confirm that women have larger areas in the brain dedicated to tracking gut feelings , which is why they 're quicker at working out what others are thinking and reach conclusions based on hunches			0
intuition does have its downside , though			0
scans show that this sense can be seriously compromised by lack of sleep , hormones , stress , illness and blood sugar dips			0
men and women are equally smart , but each sex uses different parts of the brain to solve problems or achieve goals @entity236 if you blubbed through @entity239 while your husband remained unmoved , it 's not his fault			1
science proves that women have far more cells in the part of the brain that controls empathy			0
this means they can put themselves in someone else 's shoes and get much closer to actually feeling their fear , pain and joy			1
while men and women both have brain cells called mirror neurons , activated when they empathise with other people , women have more grey matter in the areas of the brain where the mirror neuron systems are found - hence the sniffling when faced with a sobbing @entity267			0
the office is another area where innate gender differences are starkly displayed			0
ever wondered why a male boss will push on with an unpopular meeting , even when the mood has turned frosty ? that 's because the male pattern of brain activity dictates that they focus on problem solving , and are less concerned about the emotional cohesion of a group			1
women have a tendency to be more sensitive to the emotional climate			0
they will be subconsciously firing up the empathy regions of their brains to work out what other people in the room are thinking			0
dr @entity289 , left , has written a new book , right , explaining the differences between the brains of men and women which lead us to behave in different ways it 's under control the area of the brain which deals with anger and aggression - that all - important pre-frontal cortex - tends to be larger in women than men , which means women find it easier to keep strong negative emotions in check			1
brain scans also show that when a woman is feeling aggressive , she 's much more likely to launch a verbal attack - using the highly active language part of her brain - than a physical one			1
@entity317 men and women tend to worry in different ways , too			0
women 's associative thinking powers kick in , making one niggling concern quickly connect with others to create a seething mass of stress			1
furthermore , women generally have lower levels of the brain chemical serotonin than men , and low levels are normally associated with over-activity in the brain 's worry centres			1
bathed in comfortably high serotonin levels , a man 's worries will be compartmentalised into one small , defined area			1
