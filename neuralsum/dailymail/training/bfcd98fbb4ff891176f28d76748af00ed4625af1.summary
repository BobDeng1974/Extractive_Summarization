after spending a fortnight out of public view vice president @entity4 today hosted a meeting with @entity8 defence secretary @entity11 to crush rumours that he had suffered a heart attack or a stroke which would throw the succession process into chaos			1
mr @entity4 and mr @entity11 met for more than an hour to discuss @entity8 - @entity5 military relations , said @entity19 press secretary @entity18			1
concerns over the health of @entity5 's future leader @entity4 have been allayed after he was seen holding high - level talks with the @entity8 foreign secretary @entity11 mr @entity11 said the meeting went over the allotted 45 minutes because mr @entity4 was focused on finding a way to improve relations			1
' frankly my impression was that he was very healthy and very engaged , ' he told reporters later in the day			0
video of the talks shot by state broadcaster cctv showed mr @entity4 shaking @entity11 's hand , posing for photos and smiling during their conversation			1
the report made no mention of his prolonged absence			0
mr @entity11 's visit comes at a sensitive time for @entity5 with relations with the @entity8 and regional neighbours delicately balanced			1
mr @entity4 was seen for the first time in two weeks on saturday when he appeared at an event for a national science promotion day and his health was closely scrutinized during today 's meeting			2
mr @entity4 and mr @entity11 met for more than an hour to discuss @entity8 - @entity5 military relations , said @entity19 press secretary @entity18 in addition to being @entity5 's vice president , @entity4 is also a vice chairman of the @entity50 that oversees the 2.3million - member @entity51 , and is due to take over as head of the ruling @entity53 later this year and as president in the spring			1
in keeping with its secretive one - party political system , @entity55 has offered not a shred of information about why @entity4 was not seen in public , triggering speculation he had injured his back or suffered a heart attack or stroke			2
some had questioned whether he had fallen foul of president @entity66 or other top leaders , reflecting continuing uncertainty surrounding the succession and lingering political fallout from the downfall of a charismatic leader , @entity72			0
@entity5 has not even announced dates for the congress that will install @entity4 and other top leaders , an event held every five years that last time began in mid-october			2
mr @entity4 's health was closely scrutinized during the meeting for any clues about his prolonged absence , which ended on saturday when he appeared at an event for national science promotion day that has led to speculation that the party has yet to agree on the makeup of the all - powerful @entity88 or even whether to reduce it in size from nine to seven seats			2
other crucial matters also remain up in the air , including what , if any , political reforms to embark on amid a rapidly slowing economy and growing social unrest			0
more than ever , finding common ground among the party 's various constituencies appears to be a daunting task			0
' the delay apparently does suggest anything but a smooth transition of power , namely , the extraordinary difficulty of reaching consensus on the composition of the @entity88 , including the @entity88 , as well as how to handle factional politics that has never been so acute , ' said @entity110 , a @entity5 expert at @entity112 's @entity111			0

@entity133 punishment could spark a backlash from supporters in the party , the military and the public , while failure to discipline @entity72 would underscore weakness in the legal system and among the leadership			0
@entity4 is facing ' enormous hurdles to establish a highly unified leadership team , ' @entity143 said .			0
