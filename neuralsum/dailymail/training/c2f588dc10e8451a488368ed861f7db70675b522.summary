six games unbeaten but thoughts of invincibility could n’t be further from @entity4 ’s mind			2
not when he feels so exposed			2
@entity7 ’s manager had a lot to consider after this north @entity10 derby , not least how he finds his squad threadbare in defence and midfield after £ 76million of summer spending			1
the latter of those departments was decimated here — @entity17 hurting his right ankle and @entity19 and @entity20 falling to respective hamstring and calf injuries			1
@entity24 wheels away after equalising for @entity7 against @entity26 the @entity28 midfielder gave @entity26 goalkeeper @entity29 no chance from close range @entity33 ’s booking of @entity26 ’s @entity34 ( left ) after he celebrated his opening goal by cupping his hand behind his ear might have seemed harsh to some			1
however , @entity33 obviously believed @entity34 was trying to wind up @entity7 fans in such a heated local derby			1
i once cautioned @entity42 for the same thing at @entity44 — much to his dismay			2
curiously , @entity46 did the same thing against @entity48 on saturday and no action was taken against him			2
@entity4 sought an investigation into how @entity19 and @entity20 ’s injuries could occur after being rested against @entity52 in midweek , though his more pressing concern is that his midfield screen team will now miss this week ’s crucial games against @entity56 and @entity57			1
the loss of @entity19 , brilliant for 45 minutes before injury against @entity26 , will doubtless sting a side struggling to convert chances			1
but @entity20 ’s absence is more immediately significant considering the lack of rearguard options available , with @entity65 filling the gap on saturday and making the mistake that allowed @entity34 to score @entity26 ’ opener			1
@entity17 will be assessed further on monday , but is likely to miss wednesday ’s @entity56 tie			1
‘ i can play in midfield , ’ was @entity4 ’s take on the dilemma			2
‘ i would consider playing @entity73 there			0
but i only have four defenders at the moment			0
@entity65 is the only option i see			0
’ @entity78 himself is throwing up something of an issue			0
the @entity28 defender , deputising at right back for the injured @entity83 , is looking with each game to be a superb signing at £ 12m and 19 years old			0
but he ’s also acquired four yellow cards and is one from a defence - wrecking suspension			0
@entity7 had no specialist defenders on the bench , though @entity4 will not curb @entity78 ’ style			2
@entity17 is a doubt for wednesday 's match with @entity56 after picking up an injury and @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 will definitely sit out the visit of the @entity96 side @entity7 have scored 11 goals this season , but their chance conversion rate is still only the 11th best in the @entity100 ‘ he has to play his game , ’ @entity4 said			1
‘ the fact he is keen and committed maybe sometimes leads him to commit spectacular fouls			0
‘ it ’s remarkable what he ’s doing at the age of 19			0
it ’s not often you see that quality at his age			0
’ quality around the opposition box , particularly from corners , would have made the difference on saturday			0
@entity7 had 16 shots to @entity26 ’s six , but could only draw for the fourth time this term			1
after three games without a win , @entity56 - who travel to the @entity120 on wednesday - beat @entity123 2 - 1 in the @entity124 to ease the pressure on new manager @entity126			1
@entity127 was on form as @entity126 's men triumphed over @entity123 , managed by @entity130 , thanks to first half strikes from @entity133 and @entity134			2
they move up to fifth @entity135 was only fleetingly impressive , while @entity136 was poor and £ 35m forward @entity137 started on the bench			0
@entity4 indicated @entity136 and @entity137 lack confidence			0
‘ we need to give some time to @entity136 and @entity137 to gain some confidence , ’ @entity4 said			2
‘ but we have @entity19 , ( @entity24 ) @entity24 , @entity135 and @entity142 so we have enough players who can score			1
’ asked if @entity137 was struggling with confidence , @entity4 said : ‘ he has scored goals , until now			0
i ’m sure he ’ll score 15 to 20 goals			0
’ spurs nearly emerged from a jerky performance with a win , only for @entity24 to equalise late on			1
@entity150 said : ‘ the players need time to adapt to our philosophy because we play in a different system			1
’ like our @entity154 .			0

a late goal from @entity24 *rescued* a point for @entity7 in the @entity10 derby
but injuries to @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20 have decimated the club 's midfield ranks
likely to miss wednesday 's @entity165 clash with @entity56
@entity34 had opened the scoring to give @entity26 the lead
@entity26 boss @entity150 says his team need time to adapt to the new philosophy
