not these beasts in @entity7 - who sprang and leaped over an obstacle course as if they were horses			1
farmers who gathered at an agricultural show picked their favourite animals for a bizarre ' bovine agility ' contest , which pitched the 1,500 - pound beasts against each other in a dusty arena			1
bizarre : an animal looks as though it is levitating as it is captured mid-way through a jump at the contest dairy to dream : a cow 's owner leads her through an obstacle course at the @entity27			1
the ' bovine agility ' contest was part of an annual food and countryside trade fair stubborn : not all the cows in the competition were so willing - this one refused to obey its owner 's orders the huge animals were pictured leaping over hurdles with one even clearing herself several feet from the ground			1
the unusual event was held yesterday as part of the annual @entity47 and @entity46			2
the trade fair has run for 20 years - and jumping cows were not its only unusual attraction			1
there was also a bovine beauty contest which aimed to find a ' mr and @entity54 ' to be crowned king and queen of the show			2
spokesman @entity58 told @entity59 : ' these kinds of funny things are to show what these animals can do and that they 're not just there to produce food for us			0

leap : the fast - paced event echoed show - jumping for horses , which is well - established an @entity72 sport fast moo - vers : the best cows were rewarded by their owners for their high - energy antics ' it 's all about bringing the countryside to the city centre because there are a lot of families who have n't ever seen cows or horses or chickens			1
' last year the show had more than 50,000 visitors			0
there were the usual draws for farmers ' fairs , including sheepdog trials , rare breeds of ponies and a show of chickens and goats			2

it 's not exactly a common thing to see in @entity7			2
' there were ten cows and the fastest one round the course won the first prize			0
the fastest cow took just over a minute			0
' the animals were not the first show - jumping cows			1

' she 's often very headstrong but can also be really adorable , ' the schoolgirl said			0
riding cows has been popular for centuries , but the animals often take more training than horses , are more stubborn and have to be started on younger			0
