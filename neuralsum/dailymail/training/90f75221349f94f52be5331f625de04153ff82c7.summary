by @entity0 seemingly nonsensical notes in the margins of a rare edition of @entity4 have remained unread for 150 years			1
until a competition was launched to crack the code in the 1504 @entity8 edition of the @entity4 , which contains annotations in an unknown script thought to have been written in the mid- 19th century			1
an @entity12 computer engineer has won the challenge and has finally solved the mystery – to find that the notes are written in a form of @entity18 shorthand			1
code cracked : an @entity12 computer engineer has solved the mystery of what these strange scribbes mean in a rare 16th century copy of @entity26 's the @entity25 found that the notes are written in @entity18 shorthand the script is a system of shorthand invented by @entity31 in the late 18th century			1
the annotations are mostly @entity18 translations of words and phrases from the @entity37 text			0
' every consonant and vowel has a starting shape and they combine together to form new shapes representing syllables , ’ code breaker mr @entity38 wrote			1
' the vertical alignment is especially important , as the position of a letter above or below the line , or even the length of a letter segment can change the value of the grapheme			0
this explains why most notes in the @entity4 shorthand are underlined - the line being key to the transcription			1
' the case of the mystery marginalia began when the @entity60 received a donation of @entity26 ’s works from collector @entity63 in 2007 , which included the 1504 volume with the unusual notes			1
the university library ’s @entity66 lured linguists , classicists and amateur sleuths to identify and translate the script with a cash prize of $ 1,000 , ( £ 592 ) which was won by @entity38 , who is studying a digital humanities course at the university			2
working with @entity76 - a colleague who is proficient in contemporary @entity12 stenography and fluent in @entity18 - he identified the mystery script as a system of shorthand invented by @entity31 in the late 18th century and two runners - up reached the same conclusion			1
the annotations themselves are mostly @entity18 translations of words and phrases from the @entity37 text of the @entity4			2
they include lines from the epic poem such as : ' τὴν πάντες μνώοντο περικτίται , meaning ' whom all the neighboring princes wooed			0
' @entity38 , discovered that the script is a system of shorthand invented by @entity31 in the late 18th century and won a $ 1,000 competition at the @entity60 to translate text that has remained illegible for 150 years to crack the code , the duo began with the assumption that it was a system of @entity18 stenography in use in the mid- 19th century as the notes were dates april 25 , 1854			1
after rejecting several 19th - century @entity18 stenographic - or shorthand - systems , they found a chart comparing one of them to the ‘ tachygraphie ’ or shorthand system invented by mr @entity114			1
they found an 1819 edition of the work online and armed with two contemporary @entity18 translations of the @entity4 - one published in 1842 and the other in 1854 - they began the work of decoding the annotations			1
in mr @entity114 ’s system , ‘ every consonant and vowel has a starting shape and they combine together to form new shapes representing syllables , ’ @entity38 wrote			1
‘ the vertical alignment is especially important , as the position of a letter above or below the line , or even the length of a letter segment can change the value of the grapheme			0
this explains why most notes in the @entity4 shorthand are underlined - the line being key to the transcription			2
’ the annotations in the book are mostly @entity18 translations of words and phrases from the @entity37 text of the @entity4 , which features here @entity149 , who in this 1920s illustration is homesick they translated one line of script to read : ' que recherchaient tous les princes dans les entours , ' which is a word - for - word translation of a line from the poem : ' whom all the neighboring princes wooed '			2
mr @entity38 wrote in his blog : ' this is our best match for now and it gives us the certainty that the method we employed is correct , ' and shared other examples			0
in the poem , @entity167 says that @entity169 disguised himself as @entity170 and laid with @entity171 at the mouth of the river			0
the person making the notes has underlined important words and written them in shorthand beside the main text , including ' prendant donc sa ressemblence , ' which means ' taking his resembelence , ' and ' embouchure ' for mouth of the river			2
there are times when the writer gets a translation wrong and makes corrections in their translation of the @entity37 , mistaking the word ' vain ' for ' sterile ' , for example			0
mr @entity38 and ms @entity193 are continuing to study the annotations and hope to discover the identity of their author and an explanation for why they only exist in one section of the text			0
' we can not help but feel a bit disheartened that after going this far we still know next to nothing about the annotator			0
who is he or she ? we do not @entity208 are no personal references , ' he wrote			0
' in the annotations , and in the few instances in which the author uses the ﬁrst person it is only to explain why he or she committed a translation mistake			0
what about the shorthand ? it was very popular at the beginning of the @entity221 , but certainly not in 1854			2
' where did the annotator learn the code ? what is the motive for its use ? these remain open questions			0

the case of the mystery marginalia began when the @entity60 received a donation of @entity26 ’s works in 2007 that included a rare book
notes in the 1504 @entity8 edition of the @entity4 remained a mystery for 150 years until they were decoded by a computer engineer
