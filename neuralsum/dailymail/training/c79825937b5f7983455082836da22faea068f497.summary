@entity22 , 31 , has battled breast cancer for five years and it has now spread to her spine			0
her 11 - year - old daughter @entity0 , 11 , has written a list of things she wants them to do together @entity0 's heart - breaking list , which includes a girly shopping trip , seeing a show in @entity32 and visiting @entity33 , has sparked a flood of donations to help the dreams come true things i would like to save up for to do with my mum and brother while she is still well enough			1
to see @entity42 [ @entity42 ] or anyone really as we ’ve never been to a concert before and always say we will			0
to have a girly shopping day with mum at @entity48			1
to save up enough for my big dream would be to save enough to go to @entity50 or to take my mum to see a show in @entity32 to have the experience i did with my school as she always wanted to go , but any of these would be good memories for us all :-) by @entity10 age 11 but @entity0 is determined to brighten her mother 's last days , filling them with trips they can do along with her 15 - year - old brother			1
the bucket list includes going to @entity33 and seeing the boy band @entity42 ' or anyone really , as we 've never been to a concert before '			1
@entity0 also hopes to save up enough to take her mum to a show in @entity32 as it 's something she has always wanted to do			1
@entity16 had kept details of her illness between family and friends up until now but she made the decision to publicise her condition to help build memories for her two children which they can cherish forever			2
since @entity0 ’s bucket list was launched on @entity2 two weeks ago , offers of cash and help have flooded in from the community to help make the family ’s dreams come true			1
@entity16 , who works at @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity12 , said : ' it ’s overwhelming what @entity0 ’s doing			2
she ’s only just turned 11 , but she ’s very mature for her age			0
@entity0 ( centre ) , pictured at a fundraising event , has raised over £ 2,700 towards the bucket list ' because of what we ’ve been through in the last five years she ’s grown up quicker than normal children			1
she ’s a very special little girl			0
' both of my children are amazing and fantastic			0
' the idea for the list came as the family talked about how to make the time they have left together as special as possible			2
@entity0 is determined to brighten her mother 's last days , filling them with trips they can do along with 15 - year - old brother @entity111 when they had written down some aims , @entity16 , who is undergoing monthly bone infusions and having regular radium therapy to control her pain , said that they would have to start saving			1
she said : ' @entity0 does n’t ask for a lot , we were not going to do anything extreme - just something we could work towards			2
' but when the single mother told a close friend of her plan , she was hit with the stark reality that she would n’t be able to afford a lot of the ideas			2
so the family , along with @entity16 ’s friends , made the decision to launch @entity132 and have so far raised £ 2,700			1
they are organising a trip to @entity32 and @entity33 and have been offered a villa in @entity136 for three weeks next february			1
@entity16 said : " i ’m fully aware there are a lot of other people out there in my situation			0
