unwelcome news : @entity2 is threatening to impose a surcharge on flights to @entity10 in an escalating row over airport fees			1
it means millions of people who have already paid in full for their summer flights to the country , may have for fork out even more money ' we may be forced to debit passengers for any government imposed increases in airport charges prior to your travel date , ' its message read			2
' if any such tax , fee or charge is introduced or increased after your reservation has been made you will be obliged to pay it ( or any increase ) prior to departure			2
' @entity2 , is now the leading airline between the @entity43 and @entity10 so the charges could affect millions of people who have already booked their summer flights			1
it will apply to all airports in @entity10 , but passengers travelling from @entity49 and @entity50 are expected to be hit hardest with the steepest passenger tax fees			1
if the proposed fees are introduced , they will only apply to passengers leaving from a @entity10 airport - passengers on a flight to @entity10 will not be charged			1
according to @entity58 , @entity2 ’s chief executive , the @entity10 government is currently considering proposals to double fees at the country ’s two main airports in @entity49 and @entity50			1
controversial decision : @entity2 chief executive @entity64 pictured earlier this week at the budget airline 's hotel launch , said ' we 're not going to be funding the @entity10 government 's taxes ' the budget airline does not shy away from passing costs on to their passengers			1
they offer a range of additional extras , which some airlines do not charge for			0
they include : priority boarding - passenger gets to the front of the boarding queue and boards the aircraft first			0
fee only applies per passenger / per one way flight - £ 5admin fee - this is charged for costs associated with @entity2 ’s booking system - £ 6reserved seating - this means passengers are guaranteed a seat with fellow reserved seated passengers in their travel group £ 10infant equipment - this could apply to children 's travel equipment such as a booster seat - £ 10 luggage allowance one 15kg bag , low season , booked in advance £ 15 - £ 20 ( depending on destination ) one 15kg bag , low season , booked in advance - £ 25 - £ 30 second 15kg bag - up to £ 50musical instrument - £ 50flight change fee - £ 50oxygen reservation fee - this for passengers who need to travel with an oxygen tank - £ 100name change fee - £ 110 ' it ’s a bit uncertain at the moment but it looks like the @entity10 government are going to double the airport fees overnight the day the budget gets passed			1
we have already taken a number of millions of bookings for passengers intending to travel to these airports this summer and if they double the taxes we will be sending them a bill for the increase taxes or debiting their debit and credit cards , ' said mr @entity58 to @entity131			1
@entity2 's @entity132 said : ' the @entity10 budget proposes to double passenger charges at @entity49 and @entity50 airports , as well as imposing smaller increases at other @entity10 airports			1
it appears that these increases will become effective immediately after the budget is passed and any passengers who have already booked to travel later this summer will have to pay these higher fees , if the budget is approved by the @entity10 parliament			1
' airlines are legally within their rights to take money from customers who have already paid , but the decision to impose airport charges has not been finalised			0
@entity149 has announced it will absorb any increase			0
mr @entity58 said passengers who object would get a full refund : ' you can of course reject that additional payment , cancel your flight and then not fly with us if you so wish			1
but we ’re not going to be funding the @entity10 government ’s taxes , ' he told the newspaper			2
the budget airline does not shy away from passing costs on to their passengers			0
earlier this month in a somewhat controversial move , @entity2 spokesperson @entity132 said @entity2 staff had been asked to consider their own body weight in a bid to reduce aircraft weight and avoid hefty industry costs			2
the budget airline also recently announced it is to reduce the size of its in - flight magazine , serve less ice in drinks and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds			0
the latest policy will see the airline 's in - flight magazine ' @entity180 with @entity2 ' being reduced from an @entity183 to an @entity185 format and it will also double as a menu , which could save thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used			1
the low - cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £ 400,000 in printing costs			0
other measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a flight , and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats			0
in the past @entity2 has floated many controversial cost - saving ideas			2
inspiration : @entity2 claims it encourages staff not to pile on the pounds with the lure of appearing in its annual calendar cut price airline : last month @entity2 announced it is to reduce the size of its in - flight magazine , left and serve less ice in drinks , right , in a bid to makes savings @entity2 revolution : how the vertical airline seats might look - they were refused by an unnamed regulator in february this year one of them was to remove conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room			1
instead of being allocated a seat , @entity2 travellers would perch on a narrow shelf and lean against a flat padded backboard			2
a @entity225 would be fitted out with 15 rows of seats and 10 rows of standing berths and passengers would be restrained with a strap stretching over their shoulder , the budget airline said			0
mr @entity64 , said the refitted plane would resemble a classic @entity236 train with its distinctive ball - and - strap fittings			0
the @entity2 boss said seated passengers would be charged £ 25 per ticket and standing customers would pay between £ 1 and £ 5 for their fares - it would boost the average capacity of a flight from 189 passengers to 230			1
but in february , @entity2 announced that an unnamed regulator had halted its plan , by refusing an application for test flights			2
mr @entity64 said he was undeterred by the refusal and declared ' i think ultimately it would happen			0
' the airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet , in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and replace them with extra seats			0
the plans to ‘ charge a pound to spend a penny ’ have now been dropped , mr @entity58 said last year			0
@entity2 has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull , in bunks and has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two			2
@entity2 says that while it is trying to save on fuel , it will not pass on fuel surcharges to customers as happens with other airlines such as @entity149 and @entity274			0
' fuel is an integral part of the fare – you ca n’t fly passengers anywhere without it , ' said mr @entity132			0
' we would rather make cost reductions and charge passengers for other services			0

@entity2 sent emails to passengers this week booked to fly to @entity10 airports about possible passenger tax fee increases
@entity58 , chief executive said : ' you can of course reject that additional payment , cancel your flight and then not fly with us if you so wish '
it will apply to all airports in @entity10 , but passengers travelling from @entity49 and @entity50 are expected to be hit hardest
