ms @entity17 bought the table from a colleague in the early 1990s for £ 10 and used it to help her with diplomas she was studying for in physiology , massage and aromatherapy ' i was horrified at what @entity2 did , that someone in a caring position could have committed such crimes			1
it 's gob - smacking what he did			0
' she says she also bought a black chair which @entity2 would have sat on but is not releasing that until she sees how much interest there is in the couch , the sale of which she admits might attract ' the ghoulish '			1
