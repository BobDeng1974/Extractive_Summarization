by @entity0 a high court judge gave the go - ahead for a gravely ill teenage boy to be given potentially life - changing treatment against the wishes of his @entity7 mother			1
the unidentified 13 - year - old , known as @entity9 , was left facing profound disabilities after he contracted a disease which causes the immune system to mistakenly attack brain tissue			1
medics at the children ’s hospital where he was treated said he urgently required plasma exchange treatment , described as the ' gold standard ' for the condition			1
a judge at the @entity21 , pictured , gave the go - ahead for a gravely ill teenage boy to be given potentially life - changing treatment - against the wishes of his @entity7 mum however , his mother refused to give her consent because of her religious beliefs , meaning the hospital had to apply to the @entity21 for an order dispensing with her permission			1
in a ruling earlier this month , but only now published , family judge mr @entity33 said it was in the child ’s best interests that the treatment go ahead			2
' i recognise the powerful competing consideration prevents @entity9 ’s mother , by virtue of her adherence to the tenets of the @entity45 , from consenting to the treatment which i am invited to authorise , ' he said			0
' i recognise , and respect , the exquisitely difficult conflict with which the mother herself must be wrestling : trying on the one hand to be faithful to the tenets of her religion but facing the quite dreadful prospect of her son ’s deteriorating health			0
' in my judgment , and taking account of the risks advised , and the views of his mother , i am nonetheless clearly of the view that it is in @entity9 ’s best interests that he should receive this treatment			0
' the court heard the boy had been suffering with flu - like symptoms and was suspected to have tonsillitis , but his condition deteriorated rapidly			2
various treatments were attempted , but with ' regrettably limited effect ' , said the judge			0
at the time of the hearing on july 17 , he was being fed by tube and was only intermittently awake			0
however , medics had managed to explain to him during one of his periods of wakefulness what was intended			0
' when asked for his view as to the use of plasma exchange treatment , @entity9 is reported to have nodded his head in agreement with a " thumbs - up " to go ahead with this treatment , ' said the judge			1
he said the unanimous view of the boy ’s medical team was that plasma exchange , which filters out harmful anti-bodies from the blood plasma , was the best form of treatment for him .			2
