they are the rubble - strewn relics of a forgotten age of bustling prosperity : a mosque , a minaret , a hospital and a marketplace			1
now in ruins , they have been destroyed by a war that is not only killing generations of @entity12 but also history itself			2
and as these before and after pictures show , a heritage built over more than 5,000 years is being slowly buried under rubble			0
the ancient @entity17 of @entity18 was once an imposing testament to ancient @entity12 architecture , and said to be home to the remains of @entity23 , the father of @entity24			1

then there is the famous minaret of the @entity36 in @entity37 under which anti-government protests have been held almost every day since the conflict began			0
the historic mosque is said to date back to the 7th century			0
@entity18 's @entity41 was once a maze of winding passageways and cobbled streets selling a cornucopia of food , clothes and trinkets			1
but it now lies silent , but for the sound of bombs and gunfire , as forces loyal to president @entity54 attempt to flush rebel fighters from its streets			0
bustling : @entity18 's @entity41 was once a maze of winding passageways and cobbled streets selling a cornucopia of food , clothes and trinkets silent : but it now lies silent , but for the sound of bombs and gunfire , as forces loyal to president @entity54 attempt to flush rebel fighters from its streets nearby , @entity71 hospital is just a shell of the modern building it was			1
there are no patients , no doctors , no ambulances , no life at all at this once modern medical hub			0
in may 2012 , @entity82 phd student @entity81 , a member of the @entity83 , prepared a report on the damage done to @entity12 's heritage sites , detailing the many civilisations that helped build contemporary @entity12			1
' numerous bronze - age civilisations left their successive marks , including the @entity90 , the @entity91 and the @entity92 , ' she said			0
' they , in turn , were replaced by the @entity95 , the @entity96 , the @entity97 , the @entity98 and the @entity99 , many of whom chose @entity12 cities as their capitals			2
' the @entity104 came and left some of the most impressive castles known and the @entity107 also made its mark			0
all these cultures co-existed and conflicted , forming something new and special and found nowhere else in the world			0
' landmark : then there is the famous minaret of the @entity36 in @entity37 under which anti-government protests have been held almost every day since the conflict began collapsed : the historic mosque is said to date back to the 7th century but has since been destroyed , now surrounded by burnt - out tanks , tires and blockades meanwhile , it has emerged that the @entity12 peace talks in @entity124 are deadlocked over the divisive issue of transferring power to a transitional government , sources told the @entity128			1
the @entity12 government team reportedly presented a ' declaration of principles ' that did not mention transfer of power , before it was rejected by the opposition			1
it reportedly insisted that @entity12 choose a political system without ' imposed formulas ' from outside , while also insisting on discussing ' terrorism ' rather than transfer of power			2
opposition delegate , @entity140 , said : ' the people not acceptable are the people who committed crimes against humanity and war crimes including @entity54 and his associates who have blood on their hands			0
' also today , the @entity149 said it has restarted deliveries of nonlethal aid to the @entity12 opposition , officials said monday , more than a month after @entity154 - linked militants seized warehouses and prompted a sudden cutoff of @entity158 supplies to the rebels			1
the communications equipment and other items are being funneled for now only to non-armed opposition groups , said the @entity149 officials			1
however , @entity12 's opposition says there has been no progress on aid convoys reaching the besieged city of @entity169 and the release of prisoners from government jails			1
opposition spokesman @entity140 said talks on a political transition in @entity12 will go ahead regardless			1
' we will start talking about a new @entity12 , ' he said in @entity124 as the government and opposition delegation sat down again with a @entity179 mediator for talks			2
@entity180 : before war broke out , @entity71 hospital , @entity18 , was one of the country 's most state - of - the - art medical centres @entity187 : there are no patients , no doctors , no life at all but for gun - toting fighters and rubble no life : people walk through the @entity197 market in @entity18 , left			1
now it is empty , right a tentative agreement was reached on sunday to let women and children leave a blockaded part of @entity169			2
but mr @entity140 described the deal as a ' moral outrage ' and said people trapped in the city should receive aid inside their city and then have the freedom to leave or stay			0
the @entity179 mediator earlier said the two sides have reached a deal to allow women and children to leave a city under government siege for more than a year			0
@entity216 acknowledged that the step was a small one - he had hoped for an agreement to let humanitarian aid into @entity169			2
but the agreement was the first tangible outcome from peace talks that have been marred from the outset by low expectations and acrimony			0
mr @entity216 defended the pace of the talks , which have yet to touch upon the issue of president @entity54 's future			0
' you may gain one hour and lose one week , ' he said .			0

images show once bustling centres of *commerce* and culture now lying silent
they include @entity18 's ancient @entity17 and @entity41
a once @entity238 is now a shell and a key minaret ruined
meanwhile , @entity149 restarts deliveries of nonlethal aid to the @entity12 opposition
but rebels say no aid is reaching the besieged city of @entity169
