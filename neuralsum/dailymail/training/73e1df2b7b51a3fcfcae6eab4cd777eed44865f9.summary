by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:05 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 13:40 est , 17 july 2013 @entity2 today called for a @entity4 inquiry into the influence of lobbyist @entity6 over government moves to abandon plans for plain cigarette packaging			1
@entity10 accused @entity11 of ‘ caving in to big tobacco ’ after it emerged @entity14 election guru mr @entity6 also advises tobacco giant @entity15			1
pressure has mounted on the prime minister since mr @entity6 was hired by the @entity14 to spearhead his bid for re-election in 2015			1
row : prime minister @entity11 faced repeated questions in the @entity22 about the business interests of his election campaign chief @entity6 ( right ) the row dominated prime minister ’s questions after the coalition shelved plans to follow @entity30 in forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets			1
asked if he had discussed plain cigarette packaging with mr @entity6 , whose clients include tobacco giant @entity15 , mr @entity11 said : ‘ he has never lobbied me on anything			1
’ but mr @entity10 accused him of using ‘ weasel words ’ and added : ‘ he ca n't deny that he had a conversation with @entity6 about this issue			0
even by the standards of this prime minister this is a disgraceful episode			2
’ the @entity2 is writing to @entity2 to @entity4 to demand an inquiry into whether mr @entity11 has breached the ministers ' code of conduct			0
the code states that ministers ‘ must ensure that no conflict arises , or could reasonably be perceived to arise , between their public duties and their private interests , financial or otherwise ’			0
the row overshadowed the publication of legislation which would force lobbyists to publicly state who their clients are			0
@entity2 also found itself embroiled in the tobacco lobbying scandal after it emerged @entity62 , a former aide to mr @entity10 , left the party to join @entity15 as a corporate affairs manager			2
@entity14 mp @entity65 today wrote to mr @entity10 to ask if he had ever been lobbied by mr @entity62			0
' clearly it is important to ensure that politicians act with the utmost transparency when it comes to lobbying , ' mr @entity65 said			0
in the @entity22 mr @entity10 told mr @entity11 : ' you are the prime minister for @entity72 and @entity73 and you know it			1
' ca n't you see that there is a devastating conflict of interest between having your key adviser raking it in from big tobacco and then advising you not to go ahead with plain packaging ? ’ devastating : labour leader @entity10 said there was a clear conflict of interest between mr @entity6 's work as an adviser to tobacco firms and the government 's decision to shelve plain cigarette packets but mr @entity11 said if mr @entity10 wanted a ‘ lobbying scandal ’ he should look at his own party : ‘ the trade unions buy his policies , buy his candidates , they even bought and paid for his leadership			1
’ he added : ‘ this government is doing something that they never did for 13 years and that is publishing a lobbying @entity103			0
‘ let us remember why we need a lobbying bill : we had former @entity2 ministers who described themselves as cabs for hire , we had cabinet ministers giving passports for favours , we had a prime minister questioned by the police under cash for honours			2
‘ they are in no position to lecture anyone on standards in public life			0
’ under @entity123 rules it is for the prime minister himself - in consultation with his senior civil servant , cabinet secretary sir @entity127 - to decide whether any alleged breaches require investigation by his independent adviser on ministers ' interest			1
it is also for the @entity15 himself to decide what action should be taken over any breach of the code			0
health secretary @entity139 last night insisted there was a ‘ clear dividing line ’ preventing mr @entity6 lobbying on public health issues			1
he told @entity144 2 's @entity143 : ‘ he has n't lobbied me and he has n't lobbied the prime minister on issues to do with public health and there 's a clear dividing line			2
but there 's also transparency , we 're not hiding this fact			0
’ asked if public health was a whole area mr @entity6 was not allowed to touch , he replied : ‘ yes ’			2
shelved : @entity156 will not follow @entity30 in introducing plain cigarette packaging delay : laws passed in @entity30 mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking , but the @entity165 government will not follow suit a @entity4 source refused to answer questions about whether mr @entity11 had conversations with mr @entity6 over cigarette packaging			1
the source said only : ‘ @entity6 's firm advises the @entity14 on strategy , not ministers on government policy			2
’ and mr @entity6 himself declined to answer the same question , telling the @entity144 : ‘ the prime minister 's said everything that needs to be said on that issue			1
’ but @entity14 chairman @entity180 was more forthright in denying that there had been any conversation			0
when asked on @entity183 's @entity184 ‘ did @entity6 have any conversations with ministers about the strategy on packaging for cigarettes ? ’ , mr @entity180 replied simply : ‘ no. ’			0

prime minister faces questions about influence of @entity6 on policy
@entity196 has *ditched* plans for plain cigarette packaging
@entity14 election strategist mr @entity6 lobbies for tobacco giant @entity15
labour leader @entity202 *condemns* ' devastating conflict of interest '
