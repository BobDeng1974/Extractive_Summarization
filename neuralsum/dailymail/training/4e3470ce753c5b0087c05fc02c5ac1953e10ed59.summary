but is dream has been cruelly taken away			0
and there has been huge uproar since it was announced today			0
back to the day job : @entity4 appeared to take the snub in his stride when he was pictured today training with his club side @entity66 in @entity67 his pal @entity24 , who got to know him through @entity68 , said : ' to ask @entity4 to give everything to winning the @entity39 for @entity44 and then not picking him to take part is so disrespectful			1
' @entity27 tweeted : ' do n't understand why @entity4 was not picked for @entity39 team			1
one of the greatest ambassadors for the game			0
' former deputy prime minister @entity74 also said : ' @entity4 deserves to be in @entity21 played a crucial part in the bid & least he 'd be good at penalties ! ' @entity4 has been widely credited with helping win the @entity78 in 2005 and has been involved ever since			1
only last month icon he flew in from @entity80 to light the @entity39 torch when it landed in @entity82 from @entity40 , marking the flame 's arrival on @entity19 soil			1

the rival @entity121 bid had been expected to win but in an amazing turnaround @entity44 beat them			2
he also represented @entity6 at the closing ceremony of the @entity126 by kicking a golden football			0
@entity4 , who has more than 100 @entity11 caps and is seen as one of the country 's greatest ever players , had seemed to be certain to be part of the summer event but @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 have been picked as the over- 23 players			1
@entity4 said today : ' everyone knows how much playing for my country has always meant to me			2
so i would have been honoured to have been part of this unique @entity21 squad			0
' he added : ' naturally i am very disappointed , but there will be no bigger supporter of the team than me			0
and like everyone , i will be hoping they can win the gold			0
' as a @entity44 , i will have been really proud to have played a small part in bringing the @entity39 to my home town as part of @entity155 's [ @entity154 ] team , and i ca n't wait for the games to begin and enjoy every moment along with the rest of @entity6			1
' the celebrated midfielder is also a proud @entity44 , so the snub is a double blow			2
whenever he 's in the capital , @entity4 always makes the effort to visit a restaurant for his favourite meal , pie and mash , having been a fan of the traditional @entity170 meal since childhood			2
in fact , @entity4 paid for a delivery of pie and mash for all the @entity177 players when he finished training at @entity179 last year			0
he had trained with @entity177 during the @entity181 close season in order to try to play for @entity11 again after he was dropped by @entity183			0
yet @entity20 called dedicated @entity184 night to inform him of the decision to leave him out , explaining that he had enough midfield players and he wanted to add experience to his defence			2
the 37 - year - old superstar , who currently plies his trade for @entity115 side @entity66 , played a massive role in @entity6 securing the @entity39 seven years ago , and has stayed involved in a huge capacity since			0
star : despite being 37 , @entity4 is still playing regularly for @entity66 , pictured here last week after a 3 - 0 win over @entity195 watching : @entity20 went to see @entity4 in action before he made his decision and told him he was not making @entity7 @entity4 was included in @entity20 's 35 - man shortlist for the @entity39 but will now not made the final cut			1
@entity15 ‏ @ @entity200 terrible shame for @entity4 having given so much to to the @entity39 bid and football			1
never thought for a second that @entity4 would be excluded from @entity21 's team			2
their are arguments for and against db selection			0
what i do n't understand though , is why string him along by including him in a short list ? @entity24 ‏ @ @entity212 to ask @entity4 to give everything to winning the @entity39 for @entity44 and then not picking him to take part is so disrespectful			1
@entity27 ‏ @ ronanofficial do n't understand why @entity4 was not picked for @entity39 team			1
one of the greatest ambassadors for the game			0
and still totally capable @entity218 ‏ @ @entity219 i 'm amazed @entity4 did n't get picked for the @entity39 football team ! @entity74 ‏ @ johnprescott @entity4 deserves to be in @entity21 played a crucial part in the bid & least he 'd be good at penalties ! @entity225 ‏ @ piersmorgan relax everyone - # @entity4 can still go the @entity39			1
he just has to buy a ticket like the rest of us			0
as a football 's biggest star , @entity4 would have been a big pull for fans to come and watch @entity21 at the games and get excited about the @entity39 football - which is not normally a major draw for spectators			1
he is still expected to come to the @entity39 in some aspect and may have a role to play at the opening ceremony			0
former footballers today expressed their anger at the decision			2
former @entity245 midfielder @entity244 said : ' why was beckham on the shortlist in the first place , then not to pick him ! disgrace ! @entity20 does make some stupid decisions , ie @entity250 captain of @entity11 and no beckham in gb @entity21 , clueless ! ' @entity252 has now slashed the odds on @entity4 being given the honor of lighting the @entity39 flame at the july 27 opening ceremony , making him 5 - 1			1
five - time rowing gold medalist @entity257 is the 1 - 2 favorite			0
the @entity259 will also be surprised by the decision to leave @entity4 out			2
but @entity259 chief @entity261 had previously said @entity20 will have free reign to do as he pleases with the squad			2
he said : ' @entity20 will make a decision on the best squad available given where he is in respect of now having assessed the players that are not involved in the @entity269 and the current state of injuries			1
' he will then make the best call he can - on merit			0
i am not putting any pressure of him whatsoever to pick anyone			0
' we discussed the whole topic of selecting over- 23 players back more than a year ago but i have n't subsequently			0
delight : @entity4 and his wife @entity281 ( left ) leave the @entity7 celebration party after @entity44 won the @entity39 in 2005 effort : @entity7 sport ambassadors ( from left ) @entity4 sir @entity257 and @entity286 curtain call : @entity4 even represented @entity6 at the @entity289 closing ceremony from a high platform in the stadium family man : @entity4 , with his wife @entity281 and his three boys , had dreamt of being involved in the @entity39 ' we have been very clear from the outset , it 's absolutely @entity20 's choice and he is totally free to make the selection of the team he believes will put in the best performance			1
it 's as simple as that			0
' as a global superstar @entity4 would have been a big pull for fans to come and watch @entity21 at the games and get excited about the @entity39 football - which is not normally a major pull			1
@entity4 is still expected to come to the @entity39 in some aspect and may have a role to play at the opening ceremony .			1
