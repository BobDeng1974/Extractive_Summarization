padding such a long way back was a tall order for a little lapdog with stumpy legs			0
so when @entity7 the @entity6 terrier was dumped by thieves 120 miles from his home , he found a novel way to bring about a snappy rescue			1
with great presence of mind – or luck – he dashed into a deserted country lane just as an @entity17 van drove by			0
reunited : @entity7 the @entity6 ( with owner @entity18 , right ) - who travelled from @entity19 , @entity20 , to @entity21 to pick him up after he was rescued the @entity17 inspector @entity23 ( left ) safe now : the seven - year - old dog ran out of the woods in front of the inspector 's van and started barking the near - miss , plus a lot of barking , made @entity17 inspector @entity23 pull over			1
when she opened her cab door , @entity7 bounded in and started licking her face appreciatively			1
because the seven - year - old was microchipped , @entity17 staff were able to trace his owner , @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20 – the opposite end of the @entity37 from where he was found in @entity39 , @entity21			1
inquiries revealed @entity7 had been missing for 12 days after being stolen with miss @entity18 ’s other @entity6 terrier , @entity42 , during a raid on her home			1
miss @entity18 , 23 , put up 400 posters near her home and launched an appeal on @entity47 to find the dogs after the burglary on march 21			2
yesterday , inspector law said : ‘ i was just driving down the deserted road when i saw @entity7 run towards me , clearly trying to attract my attention			2
he ran right in front of the van , barking , and as soon as i stopped and opened the door he just bounded in and jumped on the seat			1
‘ it was as if he recognised my uniform and knew i was there to rescue him			0
taken : @entity7 ( left ) is back , but miss @entity18 ’s second terrier @entity42 ( right ) , who was also stolen , is still missing @entity61 : inspector @entity50 reunited @entity7 with a delighted @entity62 , who drove 112 miles from @entity19 in the @entity20 ( point a ) to @entity39 in @entity21 ( point b ) to collect her beloved pet ‘ i have had plenty of people wave me down for help but i have never actually been flagged down by a dog in need of rescue before			1
’ miss @entity18 , who runs her family ’s haulage firm , has had @entity7 since he was a puppy			1
@entity42 , five , is not microchipped and is still missing			0
the pets are thought to have been stolen by dognappers who cash in on the lucrative trade in @entity6 terrier puppies , which can sell for £ 900			0
they have become increasingly popular after being photographed with celebrity owners such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
the two dogs were the only things taken in the break - in			2
it is thought @entity7 was dumped by the thieves when they realised he is neutered			2
@entity42 has not been spayed so can still breed			0
miss @entity18 , said : ‘ it was like he just flagged her down and knew who she was			2
it is incredible that he rescued himself like that			0
’ anyone with information about missing @entity42 should call the @entity17 on 0300 123 8018			0
