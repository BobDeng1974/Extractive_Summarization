@entity5 , 61 , from @entity6 , @entity7 ( pictured ) , was preparing for the first @entity8 without his wife of more than 21 years - who passed away in september – when the ambulance turned up on @entity11 the widower was forced to explain to the driver , who had been sent by @entity19 – a firm which provides transport for @entity23 organisations - that his beloved partner had passed away			1
he said that while the staff could n't be more apologetic , he was disappointed by @entity19 's response			0
he said : ' i was in a state of shock that this could have happened , on that day of all days			0
' it 's bad enough to make a mistake like that on any day , let alone on @entity11			1
i just could n't believe it			0
' i could n't say a bad word against the two members of staff who arrived			2
they were dumbfounded and really apologetic			0
' but i 'm fuming with @entity19 , because when i called them all i got was that it " would n't happen again " , which made me madder			0
paramedics - sent @entity19 - had arrived to take @entity41 to @entity6 's @entity42 for dialysis treatment but were told by her husband that she had died three months ago ' my wife was ill for quite some time and had to receive dialysis			1
i used to take her to the hospital myself but then she gradually got so ill that they had to take her in an ambulance			2
' she gradually got worse and in september had to go into intensive care			0
she was far too young			0
' mrs @entity41 died from kidney failure aged 57 , following a ten - year battle with breast cancer , diabetes and chronic myeloid leukaemia			2
as a result of her medical conditions , in the weeks leading up to her death she had been receiving dialysis at @entity6 's @entity42 three times a week			0
mr @entity5 said he is angry that the blunder was allowed to happen , especially on @entity11 @entity19 had provided her with transport to and from the hospital after she became too unwell for her husband to be able to take her himself			1
after she was taken into intensive care , where she later died , the ambulances were cancelled			2
however , a mistake meant she was added back onto the rota over the @entity8 period			0
staff from the hospital transport services arrived at the widower 's home at 6.30am on december 24			1
@entity78 , head of @entity79 , has now apologised for the mistake and said he will work to ensure it does not happen again			0
he said : ' i am sorry for the distress and upset caused by the arrival of an ambulance to mr @entity5 's home			1
' as a dialysis patient , mrs @entity41 was taken in and out of hospital regularly until september this year when she sadly died			2
' after mrs @entity41 was admitted to hospital in september , we were notified by the hospital and suspended the bookings			0
' while planning and scheduling the journeys to take place over the @entity8 period , one of our journey planners reinstated the booking in error and that is why an ambulance was sent			1
' the booking records have now been permanently closed to ensure this does not happen again			0
' we have contacted mr @entity5 to apologise for the error			1
