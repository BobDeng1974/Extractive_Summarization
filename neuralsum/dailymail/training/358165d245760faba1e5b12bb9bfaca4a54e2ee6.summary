by @entity1 reporter published : 16:03 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 17:17 est , 4 october 2012 former vice president @entity2 has addressed president @entity4 's lackluster performance in the first 2012 debate , blaming his less - than - stellar performance on the @entity7			1
@entity7 , mr @entity2 said , is five thousand feet above sea level and mr @entity4 did not have the necessary time to adjust to the altitude			1
' i 'm going to say something controversial here , ' mr @entity2 said on @entity14 , before dropping his bewildering hypothesis			2
' @entity19 did his debate prep in @entity7 , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' @entity4 arrived in @entity7 at 2p.m			1
today , just a few hours before the debate started			0
' the amount of time either candidate spent in the elevated city can effect a speaker 's performance , mr @entity2 argued			2
challenge : the amount of time eiter candidate spent in the elevated city can effect a speaker 's performance , mr @entity2 argued ' when you go to five thousand feet , and you only have a few hours to adjust ... ' he said , implying that mr @entity19 's extended period in @entity36 's capital gave him an edge on the president			1
the other @entity14 pundits did not buy mr @entity2 's theory			2
altitude sickness , also known as acute mountain sickness ( @entity43 ) , is the term to describe a variety of nonspecific symptoms , acquired at high altitude or in low air pressure , resembling a case of ' flu , carbon monoxide poisoning , or a hangover , ' it commonly occurs above 2,400 metres ( 8,000 feet ) during acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes			0
the official elevation of @entity7 , however , is exactly one mile or 5,280 feet ( 1,609.344 m ) above sea level			0
' i just came from @entity61 the same day , ' current tv host @entity59 said			0
' you know what i did ? i drank two cups of coffee coming out here			0

another hole in mr @entity2 's argument is that mr @entity4 never spoke more eloquently than in 2008 , when the @entity84 was held in @entity7 and the president accepted their nomination .			1

@entity2 blamed @entity36 capital 's elevation for president @entity4 's stale speech
but mr @entity4 accepted 2008 @entity84 nomination with *rousing* *energy* in @entity7
