by @entity0 smokers should cut down on cigarettes if they ca n't give up , according to new guidance from @entity5 health professionals			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , has finally conceded that although stopping completely is the best way to reduce health risks , many people are unable to do so			1
the landmark guidance has been issued to reduce tobacco - related harm for people struggling to kick the habit			1
it is also the first official endorsement of nicotine - containing products which can be used to help people cut down on the amount they smoke			2
they say that substituting some cigarettes with nicotine replacement therapies should help those targeted by the advice include people who may not be able to give up smoking immediately , those who want to stop smoking without giving up nicotine and those who might not be ready to stop but want to reduce the amount they smoke			1
professor @entity36 , director of the @entity37 , opened a press briefing about the guidance with a @entity41 quote : ' giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world			2
' i know because i 've done it thousands of times			0
' prof @entity36 added that the guidance endorses cutting down on smoking with the help of licensed nicotine products such as patches and gum to help reduce the harm caused by tobacco			1
one in five adults in @entity56 smoke , and around two thirds of people who smoke say they 'd like to quit he pointed out that while nicotine is a ' relatively harmless ' substance , there is a lack of clarity over the safety of nicotine replacement therapy ( @entity67 ) and what substance actually causes death			1
' put simply , people smoke for the nicotine but die because of the tar in tobacco			2
' however , smoking tobacco is highly addictive , which is why people find it so difficult to stop smoking , ' he said			1
professor @entity76 , @entity6 guidance developer , gp and professor of behavioural medicine at the @entity79 , said the guidance gives him another option to present to patients - and highlighted the safety and usefulness of @entity67			1
he said when someone smokes cigarettes combined with @entity67 they are more likely to stop smoking			0
there is no evidence the combination of smoking and using @entity67 is harmful , he said			0
e-cigarettes are an increasingly popular @entity67 option but they are controversial because they have not yet been licensed as safe and effective by drug watchdogs			2
the devices provide a nicotine ‘ hit ’ to the user without the tar but there are fears they may pose a different health hazard			0
but the guidance from the @entity6 says doctors seeking to help smokers can advise ‘ these products are likely to be less harmful than cigarettes ’			1
professor @entity76 said he will tell patients that using e-cigarettes is ‘ better than smoking			0
' ‘ the safest thing is to use licensed nicotine replacement products - but a lot of people do n’t want to use nicotine gum ’ he added			1
the cost to the @entity115 in @entity56 of treating smoking - related illnesses is an estimated £ 2.7 billion a year concern has been raised that propellants used to produce the vapours from e-cigarettes may be potentially harmful			0
the @entity5 watchdog , the @entity122 is currently producing guidelines which are expected shortly			0
the latest @entity6 guidance says nicotine replacement therapy , which includes patches and gum , can be safely used even when the patient continues to smoke			1
nicotine replacement therapies such as patches are now endorsed as a healthy alternative there is no possibility patients will overdose on nicotine , which is a ‘ relatively harmless substance ’ , it says			1
prof @entity76 said when someone smokes cigarettes combined with @entity67 ( @entity67 ) they are more likely to stop smoking and smokers who eventually want to quit should start using them			0
he said ‘ advisors should reassure people that licensed nicotine - containing products are a safe and effective way of reducing the harm from cigarettes , and that @entity67 products have been shown in trials to be safe for at least five years ’ use			0
‘ experts believe that lifetime use of these products will be considerably less harmful than smoking			0
’ professor @entity153 , chairwoman of the @entity6 guidance development group , and professor of health policy at the @entity157 , said ‘ the cost to the @entity115 in @entity56 of treating smoking - related illnesses is an estimated £ 2.7 billion a year			1
‘ one in five adults in @entity56 smoke , and around two thirds of people who smoke say they ’d like to quit			0
’ prof @entity153 said people tend to under - use @entity67 products for fear they are unsafe or bad for their health , but said ‘ you can continue to use clean nicotine for quite some time			0
” electronic cigarettes were not included in the guidance as they are not a licensed nicotine product and have no ‘ guarantees ’ , prof @entity36 said			2
@entity172 , a smoker of 25 years , said electronic cigarettes ‘ present a good opportunity for people to quit smoking ’			0
mr @entity177 said he has spent in excess of £ 20,000 on cigarettes and said some people might argue that smoking is ‘ as sensible as putting your fingers in a toaster ’			0
mr @entity177 has tried various methods to quit smoking including nicotine gum , hypnosis and going cold turkey			2
‘ i think this new guidance is going to be particularly helpful ‘ he said .			2

@entity20 and @entity190 issued the landmark advice
said those who find it difficult to quit can reap benefits if they cut down
@entity6 also *recommend* the use of nicotine replacement therapies such as *chewing* gum and patches to help reduce daily tobacco intake
some experts also believe e-cigarettes could be a helpful therapy although they were not included in the guidance
