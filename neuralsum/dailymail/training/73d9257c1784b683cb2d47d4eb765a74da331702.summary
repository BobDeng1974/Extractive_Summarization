by @entity0 staff at key industrial plants are having to sit in the cold doing nothing as firms shut off power to avoid crippling energy bills			0
heavy industries such as steel manufacturing face a complex price - setting regime which means , for example , that boiling a kettle during periods of peak demand can cost up to £ 27			1
some are now trying to protect themselves by shutting down during high - demand winter periods			1
heavy industries such as steel manufacturing face a complex price - setting regime which means , for example , that boiling a kettle during periods of peak demand can cost up to £ 27 industry leaders say this ‘ @entity23 ’ scenario is damaging the economy			1
the details emerged amid growing concern of an energy gap caused by the switch from coal - fired power stations to green energy , in particular wind farms , which means @entity32 could face an electricity shortage by the winter of 2015 - 16			1
@entity35 , chairman of heavy steel engineering firm @entity36 , said he expects the plant to shut down around 30 times over the winter			1
‘ it costs us £ 27 to boil the kettle , ’ he said			1
‘ we end up telling our workers to sit in the mess room to keep warm because we ca n’t afford to keep going			0
it is a crazy system and it is getting worse			0
’ the unusual measures are the result of a ‘ triad ’ price - setting regime unique to @entity32 energy supply			1
a portion of the charge paid by industry for its electricity goes to the @entity55 to maintain and improve cable networks			0
@entity35 , chairman of heavy steel engineering firm @entity36 , said : ' it costs us £ 27 to boil the kettle ' the figure is based on how much electricity the 100,000 heaviest users consume during three undisclosed half - hour periods of peak demand between november and february , called triads			1
consequently firms try to avoid these periods , when the price of electricity spikes upwards by as much as 300 times			2
@entity70 ( @entity32 ) in @entity71 has shut down daily this winter for up to three hours at peak times			2
and @entity73 said a specialist division in @entity75 shut down between 4pm and 6pm every day last week			0
the firm was hit with a £ 1million bill after operating during a half - hour peak period			1
high @entity32 energy bills , partly driven up by tariffs imposed to fund a shift to green energy , are a handicap to the economy			2
the chemical arm of @entity73 , which is @entity86 - owned , closed a soda ash plant in @entity88 last year in favour of importing from the @entity90 , while @entity91 of @entity92 is shutting a pigment plant in @entity94 next year			2
in december energy industry regulator @entity95 announced measures to head off the threat of blackouts in 2015			0
firms will be paid to cease production on winter evenings			0
director of the @entity104 , @entity105 , said : ‘ how are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having @entity23 levels of reliability for power ? ’ this photograph shows @entity115 steelworks in @entity116 , @entity117 @entity55 said all charges and the triad system were agreed with customers			2
a spokesman said : ‘ large business users are incentivised to reduce their usage at times of peak demand			0
‘ this has the effect of reducing overall peak demand , so less investment is needed to upgrade transmission networks to deal with peaks in demand			0
it also smoothes out the peaks in demand so that power stations can be operated more efficiently			0
’ he also challenged the suggestion it would cost £ 27 to boil the kettle during a triad , saying the figure was an average of £ 1.46 .			1
