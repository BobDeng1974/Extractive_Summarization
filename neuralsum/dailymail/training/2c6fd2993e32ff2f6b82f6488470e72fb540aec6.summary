by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 12:48 est , 7 july 2013 critical : sir @entity2 , chairman of the @entity3 , wants to trim down @entity5 ' perks gold - plated pensions and ‘ goodbye grants ’ worth tens of thousands of pounds for @entity5 could be scrapped under an overhaul of parliamentarians ’ pay			1
the perks have been branded a reminder of the ‘ old , cushioned world of privilege ’ by sir @entity2 , the chairman of the @entity3 ( ipsa )			1
this week the watchdog is expected to unveil a scaling back of the ‘ excessively generous ’ pensions entitlements and golden goodbyes that many mps enjoy as part of @entity3 ’s review of pay and expenses			1
however sir @entity2 is also expected to controversially suggest a pay rise for mps of around £ 10,000			1
this would take their basic pay to around £ 76,000			2
sir @entity2 has argued more pay is necessary to avoid a repeat of the 2009 expenses scandal			1
but sir @entity2 said that overall , his proposed reforms would make mps cheaper for the taxpayer			1
it is believed he will target pensions and resettlement grants in an attempt to thwart public anger over any pay rises			1
mps who lose their seats can get up to £ 33,000 to help them ‘ resettle ’ into ordinary life			0
the pay - off is virtually unheard of in the private sector , where many ordinary workers are made redundant with barely a few weeks ’ severance pay			0
when 200 mps lost their seats at the last general election , taxpayers had to fund £ 7 million in resettlement grants			0
officials are also discussing ending final salary pensions for mps			0
currently , they pay 13.65 per cent of their annual salaries into the scheme - a higher contribution than most workers			0
controversial proposal : sir @entity2 's suggestion of a parliamentary pay rise of nearly £ 10,000 to £ 75,000 a year will be published in the coming week however , they also get much more generous pay - outs , around £ 30,000 a year in retirement after 20 years			1
taxpayers spend £ 13.5 million a year funding pensions of retired @entity5			2
one proposal is to pay mps a pension based on their average earnings during their parliamentary careers			0
this would be line to the deal given to millions of public sector staff which will be phased in from next april			0
writing in the @entity78 , sir @entity2 said : ‘ given what has happened elsewhere in the public sector , @entity5 ’ excessively generous pension arrangements seem out of place			1
‘ similarly , resettlement allowances , which until recently were worth up to one year ’s salary to compensate an mp who lost his or her seat or who decided to stand down from parliament , are a reminder of the old , cushioned world of privilege and make no sense to the general public			0
‘ the very notion that we have to ‘ resettle ’ former mps is odd			0
these pay - outs are a historic peculiarity			0
’ @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 have all argued against any pay rises for mps at a time of austerity			1
austerity : @entity101 , left , and @entity99 , right , have both advised against any pay rises for mps controversy over the proposed pay rise grew as it emerged that around 200 commons cleaners , cooks and manual workers faced the axe to pay for the pay rise			1
the move would have saved £ 6.5 million			0
but it was rejected by officials who warned of a public backlash if the money was funnelled back into pay rises for mps			2
sir @entity2 is expected to unveil his plans on thursday , before they are put out for consultation			2
mps will not have any say , however , as @entity127 handed over the final decision to @entity3			0
in the past , mps had a vote on their pay , a move which led to many vetoing pay rises for fear of looking greedy to their constituents .			2

sir @entity2 wants to cut down @entity5 ' pensions and ' goodbye grants '
despite criticising ' excessively generous ' perks , he advises £ 10,000 pay rise
@entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 have argued against any @entity5 pay rises
