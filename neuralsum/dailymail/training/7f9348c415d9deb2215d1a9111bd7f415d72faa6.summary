an investigation into the offensive online postings of the teenage daughter of a @entity4 police officer - who dressed up as @entity6 and threatened to ' bomb ' a shop where @entity10 people were congregated - has cleared the girl of any criminal charges			1
the teen - who has not been identified because she is a minor - posted a series of outrageous items to @entity16 , including photos of herself dressed as @entity6 adorned with homemade swastika symbols			1

' her father is a state police sergeant , the @entity25 reported			2
another showed an @entity30 ice shop in @entity31 , @entity4 , where a large group of @entity10 people had gathered , with the caption : ' perfect bombing time			1
' shocking : the offensive online postings by the @entity31 teen - who has not been identified because she is a minor - were found to pose no credible threat , according to an investigation offensive : one of the most shocking posts showed a large group of @entity10 people congregated outside an @entity30 ice shop in @entity31 , @entity4 , with the caption : ' perfect bombing time			1
' in another tweet , the user wrote : ' i really wan na drive around @entity48 and run over every @entity10 with my car			1
' @entity31 is a neighboring township of @entity48 , which has an increasing @entity10 population			1

' there was never any danger being posed to the community , ' a spokesman for the office told the @entity25			0
' it did n't rise to anything criminal			2

but the outcome has angered many , who say the situation would have been vastly different if the girl was n't white			0
outrageous : the teen uploaded pictures of herself dressed as @entity6 and tweeted about killing @entity10 ' if it had been a @entity84 , this almost certainly would have been handled differently , ' @entity80 , communications director for the @entity81 , a @entity84 civil liberties advocacy organization , told the @entity25 ' if it 's associated with @entity84 , it will be viewed as terrorism			1
' if not , it will be viewed as something random and minor			0
