@entity0 was at the centre of another embarrassing @entity3 storm after being charged by the @entity4 with misconduct for making an abusive comment			1
at a time when @entity0 appears to be looking beyond his playing career with moves into the media and football administration , he has become embroiled in a row with a @entity3 follower who made a remark about his club @entity15 needing to sign a good centre half			1
@entity0 responded on september 1 by tweeting : ‘ get ya mum in , plays the field well son ! # sket			2
’ @entity15 defender @entity0 has been charged by the @entity4 for a tweet @entity0 has been charged for this tweet , made on september 1 , for using the slang term ' sket ' @entity0 ( right ) is alleged to have ' included a reference to gender ' and has been charged with misconduct @entity26 to be charged by the @entity4 according to various dictionaries , ‘ sket ’ is a @entity29 term for a whore , and the @entity4 received a number of complaints from members of the public			1
a statement on the @entity4 website said : ‘ it is alleged the comment posted on his @entity3 account was abusive and / or indecent and / or insulting and / or improper			2
it is further alleged that this breach is aggravated pursuant to @entity44 ( 2 ) as it included a reference to gender			1
’ @entity0 has until tuesday to respond but it is not yet clear whether the 35 - year - old former @entity49 captain would contest the charge			1
he was previously found guilty of improper conduct and fined £ 45,000 by the @entity4 for comments on @entity3 when @entity53 was called a ‘ choc ice ’ , hinting that the former @entity56 defender is ‘ black on the outside , white on the inside ’			0
the defender , pictured here playing for @entity15 against @entity60 , has until october 21 to respond but this is becoming a complex area for the @entity4 when @entity0 will be only too aware that in recent months the governing body took no action against either @entity66 chief executive @entity65 or @entity4 referees chief @entity67 over discrimination issues			1
no action has yet been taken against @entity70 and @entity71 for their comments in the @entity75 scandal last month when they were accused of sending or receiving sexist , homophobic and racist texts			0
that said , the @entity4 have charged @entity0 , despite the fact that he has been a member of @entity4 chairman @entity81 ’s @entity49 commission			1
he was even linked recently with the post of @entity84 vice-president			0
@entity0 is active on social media , with 5.9million followers on his @entity3 page and over 14,500 tweets @entity0 ’s profile is huge			0
he has 5.9million @entity3 followers and embraces social media to such an extent that he launched a chapter of his new book on @entity95			0
he is also an ambassador for @entity96 — indeed he was involved in a @entity96 event with presenter @entity98 in @entity99 on tuesday night — and has worked as a pundit for the @entity101			0
both @entity96 and the @entity101 declined to comment on tuesday night , but a tweet from @entity103 was fairly representative of the wider response			0
the @entity106 presenter said : ‘ thanks to @ rioferdy5 i ’ve just learnt a new word			0
the most surprising aspect of his charge is that the @entity4 knew what a “ sket ” was			2
