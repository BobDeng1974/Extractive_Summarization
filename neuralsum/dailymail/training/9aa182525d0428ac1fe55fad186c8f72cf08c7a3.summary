@entity1 1 - 0 @entity0 - click here to read @entity4 's match report from the @entity5 the timing is not perfect , considering @entity8 's rare pr gaffe with @entity10 fans this week , but wednesday night is the time supporters from all over @entity12 should lend their allegiance to the one @entity15 club who are still a @entity17 threat			1
first , asking a fan to back another team tends to be a wince - inducing request in any circumstances			2
second , it shows how our clubs have turned into @entity27 lightweights			0
tuesday night just about summed up how far the self - labelled ' best league in the world ' is skidding off the map			2
@entity10 forward @entity31 puts his side 5 - 0 ahead against @entity33 in their last @entity17 game @entity36 's @entity35 ( right ) heads a dramatic late equaliser for his side against @entity39 @entity40 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity0 at the @entity5 on tuesday @entity43 skipper @entity42 looks glum after conceding a late equaliser to @entity45 @entity39 3 - 3 @entity46 here to read @entity48 's match report from the @entity49 the @entity15 marketing men may still swear by the ' product ' but over in @entity54 land , @entity12 clubs are struggling with quality control			1
it does not help when @entity0 boss @entity57 sticks two fingers up at what is supposed to be the blue riband of club football by playing his reserves at @entity1			1
instant excuse in the event of a landslide , but at what price ? @entity57 , supposedly one of the young managerial visionaries , may yet pay for a remarkably short - sighted decision			2
oh , @entity70 , why does it always happen to you ? three goals up and cruising			0
final score 3 - 3			1
no wonder the urbane @entity76 was uber - grumpy after that one			2
@entity10 players celebrate a goal during their 6 - 0 thrashing of @entity33 at @entity80 @entity57 rested seven players against @entity1 including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 ( left to right ) @entity86 's players could play a lucrative friendly abroad with no @entity27 football to worry about @entity43 's continuing battle to make it out of the group stages has been well documented so no - one ( apart from those wearing blue - tinted spectacles ) is expecting much from that quarter			1
they have managed to reach the knock - out phase once in three attempts			2
stop tittering at the back , @entity86 fans			0
no @entity27 football for you but , hey , a long flight to a meaningless friendly in the @entity102 after @entity103			0
so , thank goodness for @entity10 , then			1
things are going so splendidly for @entity8 that the only thing he can moan about is the atmosphere at @entity80 , which is probably not the most sensible complaint he has ever made			2
library or not , the @entity15 leaders are looking just the ticket in the @entity17 too			0
@entity12 is overdue some joy in that competition			0
in 2014 it was @entity116 's turn with @entity117 and @entity1 contesting the final			1
@entity119 went to @entity120 and the galacticos			0
the year before that it was @entity125 v @entity123 , a teutonic battle settled by @entity127 at @entity128			0
@entity129 fails to stop @entity131 's strike as @entity43 lose 1 - 0 to @entity123 at the @entity132 @entity10 midfielder @entity133 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity135 @entity10 boss @entity8 has experience of winning the @entity17 with @entity137 and @entity138 @entity120 , @entity139			1
@entity127 , once of @entity10			2
@entity128 , home of football			0
our @entity17 success is by association , only			0
think back to 2009 when @entity86 , @entity39 , @entity10 – and @entity145 , sadly – reached the semi-finals			1
@entity120 's 40 - yard free kick contributed to a 4 - 1 aggregate win over the @entity149			1
@entity86 , bidding to become the first club to successfully defend their title , went on to lose 2 - 0 to @entity145			1
@entity0 and @entity10 enjoyed their own ding - dong series , admittedly spiced up beautifully by the fact that @entity8 and @entity154 can not stand each other			1
in 2008 @entity156 's double capped an amazing 4 - 3 semi-final win over @entity0 during a halcyon period for @entity15 clubs			1
@entity12 was represented in successive finals from 2005 - 2009			0
in 2012 @entity161 oversaw a penalty shoot - out victory over @entity123 while the year before that @entity86 went to @entity128 only to lose to @entity163 - inspired @entity145 in the final			0
@entity39 players ( from left to right ) @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 look dejected @entity161 lifts the @entity17 trophy in may , 2012 after leading @entity10 to @entity27 glory city goalkeeper @entity129 hangs his head during his side 's 1 - 1 home draw with @entity174 in the @entity17 the memory of those golden days is fading fast so , @entity10 , it is time to take up the challenge on behalf of the @entity15			1
to those who shudder at the thought , consider this			0
once upon a time clubs like @entity86 , @entity39 , @entity0 and @entity10 could tempt the best players in the world with a realistic promise of @entity17 success to go with domestic honours			1
the further @entity12 clubs drop off the radar , the harder it will be to attract the world 's top talent			2
there could well be an unwanted exodus too			0
think @entity193 , think @entity120			0
think about the bigger picture			0

@entity10 sit top of @entity199 and are on the verge of reaching the last 16
@entity8 's side face @entity204 side @entity33 on wednesday
@entity0 lost 1 - 0 to @entity1 and may not make the knockout stages
@entity39 threw away a 3 - 0 lead against @entity36 to draw the game 3 - 3
@entity43 are yet to win a game in @entity212 and sit third
