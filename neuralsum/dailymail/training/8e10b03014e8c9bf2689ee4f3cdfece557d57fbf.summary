now , @entity10 says he attends church and has tried to atone for his dirty deeds			2
he worships regularly , he says , and even helps out his church by volunteering to drive their church school bus			0
new leaf : former philly mob hit man @entity10 says he 's a born - again @entity24 and even volunteers to drive his church school bus ironically , this is n’t the first time @entity10 has volunteered his time			1
believe it or not , while still murdering for the mob , @entity10 was a boy scout troop leader			1
he was asked in an upcoming 60 minutes interview about his double life			0
‘ those kids did n’t know i was a hit man , ’ he smirks , ‘ and a lot of parents were mad			1
but their kids had fun when i took them camping			2
’ darker days : @entity10 was once a feared killer who eventually helped take down @entity12 's biggest crime boss , @entity16 high price : for ratting out his boss , @entity10 's former crime family gunned down his brother @entity46 @entity10 pulled off other hits , but his first — made in broad daylight — would be his most famous and perhaps the most sensationalized in @entity12 mob history			1
in the interview , scheduled to air sunday , he describes how it felt as he sat waiting , prepared to kill two men on a tree - lined sunny street			0
like ‘ i was going to work , ’ @entity10 shrugs , ‘ and part of my work that day was to kill somebody			2
’ that somebody ended up being rival mobster @entity60 , who died on the sidewalk that day in august 1993			0
the other man @entity10 was hired to kill , rival mob boss @entity62 , survived			1
the murder and attempted murder became part of a trial that ultimately took down @entity10 ’s boss — with @entity10 ’s testimony against his old boss as a linchpin in the federal case against the mobster			2
@entity10 ’s decision to turn against @entity74 would cost him			2
his former associates attempted to kill him , but he survived three shots to the head			0
then , on the very day @entity10 was scheduled to rat out @entity74 , @entity10 ’s brother @entity46 was gunned down on his way to work in what police called an intimidation tactic performed to keep @entity10 off the stand			0
betrayed ? : @entity12 mob boss @entity16 , at center in 1980 photo , was handed 5 consecutive life sentences thanks in large part to @entity10 's testimony quiet life ? : a @entity12 woman claims @entity10 has threatened her and her and her husband , who happens to be the man acquitted of @entity10 's brother 's murder @entity10 testified , anyway , and @entity16 was eventually handed five consecutive life sentences			1
after serving 10 years for murders to which he confessed in court , @entity10 was placed in the witness protection program and began an unlikely life of repentance			0
he became something of an enigma in an unnamed @entity9 suburb where he ’s made a successful living selling luxury cars			0
but as the @entity108 interview proves , the former mobster has n’t lost his signature swagger			0
the report , however , questions @entity10 ’s self - described new lease on life			0
@entity113 of @entity12 , whose husband @entity114 was acquitted of @entity116 ’s murder , claims @entity10 has left her and her husband threatening voicemails .			1

@entity10 says he 's seen the light and has no intentions of *returning* to his @entity12 mob past
even as a hit man , @entity10 led a boy scout troop and says his kids had no idea he was a killer and loved it when he took them camping
