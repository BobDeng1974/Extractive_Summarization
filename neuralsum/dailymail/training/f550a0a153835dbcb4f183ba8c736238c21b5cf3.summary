@entity0 ! the @entity1 shaped our world by @entity4 everyone knows that @entity7 had a brilliant idea in his bath and shouted ‘ @entity11 ’ at his discovery — indeed , it is possibly the only @entity14 word most people know			1
similarly , @entity16 is indelibly imprinted on our minds with the image of an apple falling on his head			0
these are what @entity24 , in this lucid , engaging and thought - provoking book , calls ‘ aha moments ’ — unexpected insights powering intellectual and creative breakthroughs			2
@entity4 , a distinguished @entity29 professor of philosophy , explores this process in the five areas of human activity in which he judges inspiration ( or revelation ) to be essential — religion , morality , science , mathematics and the arts — and examines the psychology and neuroscience behind these lightbulb moments			1
author , @entity4 , explores what happens in these instances of discovery and illustrates that original insight and invention are nothing without hard work ( stock image ) what emerges is a catalogue of brilliance , hard work , serendipity and luck , and a long history of resistance to new ideas : @entity62 , for instance , was burned at the stake for suggesting the sun was at the centre of the solar system ; @entity67 discovered penicillin as a result of keeping an untidy lab ; @entity72 ’s understanding of black holes came to him on a walk			1
the sections on science and mathematics are the most thrilling			0
for @entity79 , mathematical insights are the purest , requiring the greatest dedication in their pursuit and resulting in the purest beauty , as in @entity83 proving @entity84			0
@entity4 also shows us that original insight and invention are nothing without the old - fashioned virtues of hard work and perseverance			1
while using the conscious mind to solve a problem , great mathematicians , scientists and artists employ a process of trial and error that also requires moments of inspiration for their work to progress : ‘ chance favours the prepared mind ’ , in the words of @entity106			2
@entity108 ’s realisation that time is not absolute was followed by eight years of hard work ; @entity112 ’s 7th @entity111 theme came to him when he heard the oars of a boat — but only after many hours of struggle			1
@entity4 cites many lesser - known figures whose insights have altered the course of human endeavour			2
in many cases , what stands out is not so much the discovery itself , but the courage in defending that discovery against the accepted orthodoxy , even when such a position was dangerous or uncomfortable			0
indeed , many scientific insights have been held back by professional envy and rivalry , and women have long struggled to be heard in the male - dominated corridors of academia			0
@entity79 is a likeable and companionable guide : wry , cajoling ( ‘ if this thought does n’t utterly astonish you , you have my sympathy ’ ) and amusing at times , occasionally drawing on a personal anecdote to press home the point			0
there ’s some complicated maths and science in here , but this is largely accessible stuff			0
this book may not provide you with the recipe for your own ‘ aha moment ’ , but it will lead you to an appreciation and fresh understanding of what happens when it does occur .			1
