by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 13:55 est , 18 september 2012 tragedy : @entity2 , 17 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , died after being stabbed during a house party in @entity6 the ' old fashioned ' parents who allowed their daughter to hold a party which led to the murder of a teenager have said they took ' every precaution possible ' to keep the event under control			1
@entity15 and @entity16 , who call themselves ' fuddy duddy ' , allowed their daughter , @entity19 , to hold the party to mark the start of her gcse year at a respected @entity6 school			1
but the parents were left stunned when their carefully controlled event - which their daughter had advertised on @entity26 under a private invite setting - spiralled out of control			1
it ended in tragedy as 17 - year - old @entity2 was stabbed to death just yards from their house			1
mr and mrs @entity16 , who have lived at the property in a leafy suburb for 21 years , supervised the proceedings and even went as far as to place hazard tape around their garden and marked out steps so no one would fall over			1
mrs @entity16 said : ' we took every precaution we possibly could to make sure it was a safe party			1
' we are quite old - fashioned parents , quite fuddy - duddy			2
' we really did to everything by the book - the party started at 7.30pm and we had soft drink and food there			1
' we were supervising it the whole time and patrolled the conservatory and kitchen and the parts of the garden where the children were allowed to go			0
' the rest of the house was marked off with hazard tape - we put tape around the slabs in the garden so no - one would hurt themselves			2
' mr @entity63 , who works at an @entity65 dealership in @entity66 , said everything had been under tight control but at 9.30pm they had stopped one youngster that @entity19 did not know from entering the party			2
within 20 minutes @entity2 had been stabbed in the stomach with a single blow that killed him			2
mr @entity63 said : ' we did not see what happened as the first we knew of it was when the paramedics arrived			0
their daughter @entity19 had sent out notes to neighbours warning them that she was throwing a party and apologising for any noise in advance			2
she insisted her @entity26 page had specifically been created so strangers could not access the details			0
she said : ' i had a private page which could only be accessed by invited people - it was not a public @entity26 page			0
' the guests were allowed to bring a ' plus one ' but they had to ask first			2
' @entity19 said she did not know @entity2 , who lived in @entity3 , but said he had come with a friend of hers			1
she added : ' there were about three or four people who i did not recognise at the party so i asked who they were - i checked with them all			2

@entity79 , 47 , called for the death of her son to spur a fight back against the growing knife culture			1
two months ago official figures revealed just one in every five knife - wielding thugs is being jailed , despite a pre-election promise by the @entity166 to jail anyone caught carrying a blade			2
mrs @entity79 told the @entity169 : ‘ knife crime is getting out of control			1
kids are being injured and murdered			0
alcohol : bottles of booze leftover from the party were still in the street outside the house scene : a house in @entity182 , @entity6 , is sealed off as part of the murder investigation cordoned off : police carrying out investigations at the scene of stabbing , which has been surrounded by cordons and police cars hopes : @entity2 wanted to marry , have children and be a pawnbroker like his father , his mother said being tough on crime is n’t a sign of an uncaring society			1
it is a sign of a caring society			0
‘ any parent knows the easiest thing in the world is to say to a child to go off and do what they want			0
it is hard to say no. ’ the @entity166 scrapped their tough line on knife crime after coming to power because of concerns about cost and a higher prison population			0
mrs @entity79 , a full - time foster carer from @entity3 , @entity4 , added : ‘ it ’s typical of politicians			1
it ’s all about getting votes and then they change their minds			0
‘ but money should n’t stand in the way of saving lives			0
