two men are halfway up what has been called the hardest rock climb in the world - a free climb up a half - mile section of exposed granite in @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity9 , 36 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12 , 30 , of @entity13 , @entity8 , have been scaling their way up the face of the 3,000 feet granite monolith of @entity17 in @entity7 using only their hands and feet			1
most ascents up the imposing rock face use an approach known as aid climbing , where ropes and metal pins are used to assist the climbers			1
do n't look down : @entity12 calculates his next move up the mountain in this photo posted on @entity30 on sunday however , the @entity9 and @entity12 are instead attempting to cleanly free climb a route that has never before been climbed without aid			1
their progress up the 32 sections , or pitches , of climbing is being chronicled by climber and photographer @entity40 and filmmaker @entity41			0
the two men eat , stretch and sleep in hanging tents suspended to @entity17 's @entity45			2
they do n't have the creature comforts of home , but they have kept in touch with the outside world thanks to social media - tweeting , posting on @entity51 , feeding information for blogs and keeping in touch with a bevy of supporters on the ground			2
time to relax : on monday , the pair took a rest day to heal their hands in preparation for another day on the rock face on tuesday			2
above , @entity63 relaxes in his portaledge tent , which is attached to the rock face and hangs above the @entity67 floor far below daring : free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent			1
above , @entity9 makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on @entity17 using a headlamp on sunday night up they go : @entity63 , 30 ( left ) , and @entity9 , 36 ( right ) , have reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb @entity7 's @entity17 record breakers : if they are successful , @entity12 and @entity9 will be the first team to free climb @entity17 's imposing @entity85 rock face life : on the left , @entity9 is seen on day 9 of the climb , attempting to remove damaged skin on his hands			1
the razor - sharp rock on the wall tears up the climber 's fingertips and they use sanding blocks to keep them smooth			1
on the right , one of the meals the climbers have eaten on @entity17			2
the pair keep fueled with sandwiches like this and in the cold conditions their food is practically refrigerated ' the guys are doing great , ' said @entity108 with @entity109 , which has been filming the pair as they have battled with the route over the past six years			0
' ( monday ) they are resting and trying to grow skin back on their fingertips so they can continue to do battle with the hardest climbing sections , which involve grabbing tiny , razor - sharp edges of rock			1
' if all goes as planned , the duo could be at the top as soon as friday or saturday , @entity41 said			0
' but that 's best - case scenario			0
it could take several more days just to get through the difficult section where they currently are			0
if any weather moves in , that could also delay things , but the forecast is looking good for now , ' he said			0
it will be the culmination of a six year project to conquer the route that they have called the @entity85			1
until now the pair have been gradually edging their way up the route one pitch at a time , practicing each move until they have been able to climb freely up the holds without falling or the need for assistance from aid climbing equipment			1
previous attempts to climb the route cleanly have been beset with problems			0
@entity9 and @entity12 tried to climb it all in 2010 , but storms halted their progress about a third of the way up while in 2011 @entity12 broke an ankle after falling during an attempt			1
just after christmas 2014 the pair began their latest attempt to finally climb the entire route without stopping			2
progress : if all goes well , the pair could reach the summit of @entity17 as early as friday or saturday			1
above , @entity9 makes his way up the rock face on sunday daunting : at 3,000 - feet - tall , @entity17 is the largest monolith of granite in the world and one of the most difficult climbs many have climbed @entity45 but the pair would be the first to ' free climb ' the section using ropes only as a safeguard against falls			1
previous ascensionist have used ropes and metal pitons to help pull themselves upwards , as well as to stop them plummeting to the ground if they fall			0
@entity9 and @entity186 are pulling themselves up the route using only the tiny holds they can find on the rock			1
for @entity9 this has meant overcoming a @entity193 accident where he cut off much of his left index finger with a table saw in 2001			1
he has trained with his remaining figures to build up their strength			0
but the razor sharp granite holds on @entity45 has now led both @entity9 and @entity12 to tape their finger tips as the rock has shredded their skin			1
the first climber reached @entity17 's summit in 1958 , and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top			2
@entity40 said the two have a cellphone on their ascent , but they weren not taking calls monday because they were resting and ' want no distractions while on the cliff			0
' the two also were not answering emails from roughly 1,500 feet above the ground			0
not out of the loop : the pair keep in touch with the outside world using a cellphone they brought with them on the climb , using it to tweet and post updates to the social networking site @entity51			2
however , on monday they stayed off the device to focus on resting these practices may not seem unusual , but the climbers have relied heavily on social media to document their adventure			0
both update their @entity51 pages regularly and tweet from the @entity85 , which has been called ' as smooth as alabaster , as steep as the bedroom wall			0
' last friday , @entity12 hosted a live question - and - answer session from the wall			1
@entity239 : the first climber reached @entity17 's summit in 1958 , and there are roughly 100 routes up the steep rock faces to the top live from @entity17 : on friday , @entity12 hosted a question and answer session from the wall			1
seen climbing @entity17 , above worst is over : there are 32 sections of @entity17 to climb , but the pair have already finished the three hardest sections of the route @entity9 's wife ' , @entity254 , has also been blogging about their trip daily and wrote this post last weekend			1
' being up on the wall for over a week and the hard climbing @entity260 and @entity63 have done up until now adds an element of difficulty on top of the hard climbing they have to do , ' she wrote			2
' imagine performing your very best after not walking for one week			0
i know @entity260 has made an effort to try and do stretching , pushups , ( and ) yoga in the ( hanging tent ) hoping this might combat the unusual circumstances of living like veal between their climbing			0
so let 's hope for big things today			0
this climb definitely wo n't be over until it 's over , but i believe it 's possible			0
let 's go boys ! ! ! ' @entity12 tweeted late saturday about his difficulty scaling one section : ' battling			2
' on december 30 the pair managed to compete the hardest section of the wall - the first traverse at around pitch 14			2
writing on @entity51 later that evening , @entity12 said : ' tonight , i sent the hardest pitch of my life and the hardest on the @entity85 ! best of all , @entity260 sent right after me ! pitch 14 ( the first traverse ) is in the bag ! ' @entity9 added : ' the hardest pitch got sent by both of us tonight			1
i might be in a little shock right now			0
the route is taking a toll on our fingertips as we are now both climbing with taped up fingertips , but it does n't seem to be slowing us down too much			1
' there are 32 sections of the climb			0
on sunday night , @entity41 said @entity9 , climbing in the dark , completed the last of the three hardest sections of climbing , which was a major breakthrough , @entity41 said			2
' he still has 1,500 feet of hard , scary climbing ahead , but mentally he is feeling really confident right now , and incredibly excited			0
( @entity12 ) is extremely close to completing pitch 15 , one of the hardest			0
( tuesday ) he will try to complete it and catch up to @entity260 so they can continue forging ahead			0
' in 1970 , @entity315 and @entity316 ( no relation to @entity9 ) climbed @entity45 using ropes and countless rivets over 27 days			1
the duo prepared for at least six years for the climb , according to friends and their personal websites			0
@entity324 , the first person to climb @entity17 in one day in 1975 , said he speaks to the climbers several times a day			1
' it 's almost inconceivable that anyone could do something that continuously difficult , ' he said monday , adding that he believes they spent the equivalent of a year 's time on the wall in preparation for the climb			2
to follow @entity12 and @entity9 on their journey , follow them on @entity30			1
@entity338 and photographer @entity339 are also capturing the two as they ascend the monolith , and both have been posting pictures of the monumental climb on @entity30 as well .			0

climbers @entity63 , 30 , and @entity9 , 36 , are making their way up @entity17 - the largest monolith of granite in the world - in a single push without pulling on any equipment to aid their ascent
many have climbed @entity17 before , but if successful , the pair would be the first to ' free climb ' a route known as the @entity85 in what is considered to be the most difficult *multipitch* climb in the world
@entity9 is doing the climb despite cutting off much of the index finger of his left hand in a @entity193 accident with a saw
razor sharp holds on the rock have taken their toll on the pair and they are now climbing with their fingertips taped
free climbing involves using ropes and clips to protect in case of a fall , but does not aid the actual ascent
@entity12 and @entity9 hope to reach the summit of @entity17 as by friday or saturday to end a six year project
