breakthrough breakthrough by @entity0 with @entity1 by @entity0 with @entity1 @entity0 is just 18 , yet his newly - published memoir carries a blurb from @entity5			1
' @entity6 ... ' enthuses the president			0
@entity0 's short life has been packed with incident , but there was little in his background to suggest that he would become a teenage celebrity			2
he was born in 1997 and grew up in suburban @entity13 with his elder brother , @entity14 , and parents , @entity17 , a nurse , and @entity19 , a civil engineer			0
the @entity20 encouraged their boys to think about how the world worked : school runs were fiercely competitive as @entity0 and @entity14 tried to solve science questions fired at them by their mother			1
at home , the basement became a laboratory , from where @entity14 's attempt to turn a microwave into a ray gun plunged the entire neighbourhood into darkness			0
at school , @entity0 won prizes for science projects , but was ostracised as a geek and viciously bullied when he came out as gay , aged 13			1
then a close family friend , @entity40 , died of pancreatic cancer			1
deeply depressed , @entity0 made an unsuccessful suicide attempt			1
that awful moment proved to be a turning - point			0
at summer camp , @entity0 met a sympathetic counsellor , and began to channel his grief into the science that would make him a star			1
initially , he thought of trying to find a cure for pancreatic cancer - an ambitious task , given that he did n't know what a pancreas was			1
an online search revealed that survival rates are low , partly because the cancer is hard to detect			0
he had his project - but he needed access to a proper laboratory			0
he wrote 200 emails to university science departments - and 199 rejections later dr @entity63 , an expert in pancreatic cancer at @entity65 in @entity66 , offered @entity0 a corner of his lab to work in , under supervision			1
the supervision proved necessary as @entity0 contaminated samples by sneezing on them , and smashed a tray of test tubes by tripping over his shoelaces			2
but at last there came the moment that every research scientist longs for : his experiment worked			0
when his test for detecting pancreatic cancer won the top award at a prestigious international science competition in 2012 , his wild celebrations at the awards ceremony went viral			1
he was interviewed by @entity87 and the @entity88 , and had to fit school assignments around invitations to meet world leaders and give @entity93 talks			0
he was photographed with @entity94 and @entity95 ( who told him that politics was just like the film , @entity98 )			0
there was an audience with the @entity101 , he was hugged by @entity102 ( ' she was incredibly strong ' ) and met the president who was , @entity0 notes , ' surprisingly well versed in science '			2
of course , it was n't all praise and presidential parties			0
there was anti-gay abuse , and scepticism from the scientific community			0
' one major publication even dedicated a thousand words to why they were not going to celebrate my achievements , ' @entity0 writes			2
funny , brave and super-enthusiastic , with a healthy dose of adolescent egotism and some comic glimpses of the trials of being @entity0 's parent , @entity117 is an inspiring story for would - be scientists - just do n't complain when they turn your microwave into a ray gun			1
teen scientist and inventor @entity0 attends the @entity129 2014			2
