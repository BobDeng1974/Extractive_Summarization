by @entity0 physically carrying your kids around is one thing , but lugging their combined weight on your own frame in extra pounds is quite another			2
but a mother - of - four has lost a whopping ten stone , the weight of her children put together after they spurred her on to beat the bulge			1
@entity12 , 29 , from @entity13 , was encouraged by her three older children , @entity15 , 8 @entity16 , 6 and @entity17 , 4 , to stick to her diet after tipping the scales at 19st			1
dropped from 19st and a size 22 to 9st and size 10 by joining @entity22 and with the support of her children @entity12 's total weight loss is equivalent to the combined weight of her children ( @entity27 ) @entity17 , 4 , @entity15 , 8 , @entity28 , 19 weeks and @entity16 , 6 the adorable tots would cheer on their mother if she was doing well , and even warn her against eating less nutritious foods			1
now @entity12 has lost an impressive 10st , the same as her four children ’s combined weight - despite becoming pregnant with baby @entity28 , 19 weeks , during her weight loss - and now weighs in at a svelte nine stone			1
@entity12 said : ' as soon as i joined @entity22 the kids were behind me every step of the way			1
' they ’d support me and tell me off if i went to get something unhealthy out of the fridge			2
' every time i had a weigh in they ’d always ask me how i ’d done and congratulate me			0
' now , when they see old pictures of me they do n’t recognise the person as their mummy			0
@entity12 gained weight eating takeaways and burgers and snacking on crisps and cake ' i had my own little team to keep me going			1
' i ’m just so pleased i ’ve been able to do this for them			0
' @entity12 began to put on weight at the age of 17 after being diagnosed with @entity61 ’s disease			1
' i was 17 when i was diagnosed with @entity61 ’s , and the medication made me gain quite a bit of weight quite quickly			2
' then after that i just got fatter and fatter			0
' i just ate the wrong foods - i ’d have takeaways and burgers and i ’d snack on crisps and cake			1
' if i ever felt hungry during the day i ’d go to the fridge and just cut myself a chunk of cheese - i ’d never do that now			0
' then i went onto have three children in the space of five years , and because i was pregnant i used it as an excuse to eat more			2
' before i knew where i was i weighed 19 stone			0
' but after seeing an unflaterring photo of herself , @entity12 decided to join @entity22			1
@entity12 said : i ’d tried other diets before , but this time i was determined ' i was a size 22 and even then i sometimes had to go up a size			1
' when i saw the picture of myself , i just did n’t realise i was that big			0
' but i took to @entity22 straight away , and actually found it easy			2
' i lost the weight really quickly - i had to stop when i had @entity28 but as soon as he was born i lost the baby weight and then some			2
' as soon as @entity12 began dieting , her loving children were determined to help their mother , becoming her own personal support team			1
@entity12 said : ' i explained to the children that mummy was going to start eating more healthily			1
' at first there was n’t much of a reaction but soon they really started to notice what i was doing and they were so positive			0
the children became @entity12 's support team , cheering on her successes and discouraging her from eating bad foods having lost over six dress sizes , @entity12 is now swamped by her old trousers ( left ) while @entity15 , 8 , and @entity16 , 6 can easily fit one in each leg ( right ) ' they ’d tell me off i was going to give into a craving and eat something naughty , and @entity16 would always ask me how i was doing			1
' i did n’t want to disappoint them so i knew i had to keep going			0
' it ’s been great for them as they understand the importance of being healthy and to eat good foods			0
' now , the children do n’t recognise old pictures of their mother			0
@entity12 said : ' the other day i was looking through some pictures and i asked @entity16 who the lady in the picture was			2
breakfast : nothing lunch : sandwich with crisps and chocolate bar dinner : burger with chips snacks : cheese , crisps and cake breakfast : @entity140 and banana lunch : @entity22 soup or ham salad sandwich dinner : grilled chicken salad snacks : weight watchers biscuits ' she had no idea and was even more shocked when i told her it was me			1
' it ’s lovely to see how proud they are of me			0
' @entity12 has now dropped an impressive six dress sizes to a size 10 , and could n’t be happier			1
@entity12 said : ' i wish i ’d done this years ago			2
' not only do i weight less , but i feel like a different person			0
' i ’m so much happier and healthier			0
