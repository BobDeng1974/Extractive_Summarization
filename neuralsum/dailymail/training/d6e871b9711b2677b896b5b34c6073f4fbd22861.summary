@entity1 told @entity3 's @entity2 that he wants their findings to generate positive headlines with particular regard to @entity3 's £ 110 billion yearly spend			1
the watchdog has been a thorn in the side of @entity14 , publishing a series of critical reports on wasteful spending and refusing to sign off the @entity9 ’s budget for 18 consecutive years because of concerns about fraud			1
' your reports are not released into a void but into the rough and tumble of political life and media reporting , ' he said on thursday night			0
' every year , they generate headlines that ‘ yet again the @entity9 ’s accounts have not been signed off ’ , with deceptive allegations of fraud and mismanagement			1
you and i know that such headlines can be misleading			2
' given this media handling of information , and its impact on public opinion in some countries , the court might want to give some further thought as to how it can encourage more nuanced reporting			0
' it ’s important that citizens can have the whole picture , with all its nuances			0
' in june this year the watchdog was told it would have its funding slashed by 4.2 per cent			0
' in the end we are all responsible for @entity3 and its image , ' @entity1 went on			2
' in times of crisis , it is more vital than ever to foster confidence			0
we should also be teaching , to convince @entity3 and demonstrate clearly that @entity3 is not the source of problems , but the solution			2
' his comments today angered @entity68 mps who accused him of glossing over the @entity9 's accounts to mislead the public			1
reduction : the financial watchdog that has refused to sign off the @entity75 's budget for 18 consecutive years is to have its funding slashed by @entity14 critics : @entity79 mp @entity78 ( left ) said @entity1 was trying to ' get us to turn a blind eye to dodgy account keeping ' while @entity84 leader @entity83 ( right ) asked , ' in which other banana republic in the world would the president publicly call for less exposure of waste of taxpayers ' money ? ' @entity84 leader @entity83 told the @entity93 : ' @entity94 which has not signed off the @entity9 accounts for 18 years , is asked to go easy and provide good @entity96 only for the @entity9 , ' he said			1
' in which other banana republic in the world would the president publicly call for less exposure of waste of taxpayers ’ money ?			0
' @entity79 mp @entity78 added : ' @entity1 invokes euro idealism to try to get us to turn a blind eye to dodgy account keeping by his own @entity106			2
' in doing so he discredits the very system he seeks to defend			0
