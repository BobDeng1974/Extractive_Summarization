by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 ’s new fashion collection looks a million dollars on her famous friends			1
but to afford any of it , you may need a celebrity - sized salary			0
the 40 - year - old supermodel ’s 15th range for @entity10 , which marks her return to design after a four year break , is targeted at the average @entity15 shopper			1
but within hours of the star - studded launch party , eight of the 40 pieces had already sold out online yesterday … and were being touted on @entity19 for stratospheric prices			1
it 's a sell out ! a lot of pieces , such as this £ 75 smock dress from @entity3 ' new @entity10 collection , have already sold out - despite going on sale at 9am it is believed that many of the @entity19 sellers queued to attend a special preview event on tuesday night , when a limited amount of shoppers were allowed into @entity10 ’s flagship @entity33			1
onlookers said they bought bundles , with some walking away with five of the same item			0
it meant they were then ready to sell on @entity19 when @entity39 began to sell out			2
indeed some shared their plans on @entity44 , with one writing : ‘ @entity3 for @entity10 range is very average			1
only worth buying if you want to triple your money by reselling on @entity19			2
’ reacting to the @entity19 surge , the spokesman added : ‘ i could give you a personal reaction , but i do n’t think it would be printable			2
there is no official comment			0
’ it 's been the most highly anticipated collaboration of the year and today saw @entity3 ' collection for @entity10 finally land			1
after a four - year hiatus , the supermodel 's hotly anticipated range of festival - inspired clothing went on sale at 346 @entity10 stores across 41 countries and dropped online at 9am			1
so popular are the model 's @entity67 - style pieces , including fringed suede jackets , jump suits and maxi dresses , that a lot of the pieces sold out in a matter of minutes - and are already cropping up on @entity19 for over three times as much			1
fashion fans are clearly keen to snap up the range ahead of festival season ; a £ 75 embroidered smock dress is already out of stock in all sizes , as is a £ 130 cocktail dress , on @entity84			1
net - a - porter.com is also selling some of the more pricey garments , and even they 've sold out			0
a £ 120 paisley print silk coat is long gone , as is her £ 75 floral dress and the £ 80 tuxedo trousers she wore to the store last night			0
but do not fear , fashion fans ! there are still plenty of silk blouses and graphic print kaftans to go around			0
@entity3 is said to have taken inspiration from her own wardrobe , which , despite her status as a supermodel , is n't just full of designer labels			2
she 's also a fan of scouring the rails of second - hand stores			0
main attraction : hundreds of shoppers turned up at the flagship store to grab a glimpse of @entity3 , wearing a tuxedo suit from her range , obviously , as she unveiled her new range of festival - inspired clothes would you pay that much for a @entity115 design ? one blue jacket is already on sale on @entity19 for £ 750 , over three times the original price of £ 120 a weave waistcoat , suede shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the @entity67 vibe			1
the latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the 40 - year - old has worn to three @entity127 concerts which she refers to as her ' gig jacket '			0
as well as channelling a vintage look , she was also keen to reflect her laid - back style			0
there are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use satin material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the beach in over the summer			0
for evening wear , there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh			0
many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage - feel with fringing , sequins and crepe satin			0

while much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices , one dress is a more pricey £ 600			0
the high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand - beaded dress			0
@entity3 first collaborated with @entity10 in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects			1
last night , the range was unveiled at the flagship store , causing @entity33 to practically shut down as fashion fans waited impatiently for a first look at the new range			1
the crowding was exacerbated by the tube strike : bewildered commuters braving the reduced service were trying to pile into an overcrowded @entity33 station at the same time as the model 's fans were gathering			0
they must have got up early ! fashion fans raced to net - a - porter to snap up the range , with many pieces already sold out the supermodel finally appeared at around 6.20 , at which point thousands were waiting impatiently , camera phones poised			1
@entity3 sauntered onto the stage erected outside the main store entrance , wearing a sparkling black blazer and matching trousers , from her own collection , naturally			2
the model , although certainly used to huge amounts of attention , appeared almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crowd			0
@entity3 joined @entity223 dj @entity222 on stage - however , the only thing she said once the @entity222 introduced her was : ' happy shopping '			2
she disappeared after her brief appearance to go for a private dinner with friends and supporters - including @entity230 and @entity231 - who were browsing the rails inside the store			0
selected friends , family and supporters had been invited inside for a special vip preview			0

following the launch of @entity3 's latest range for @entity10 the online auction site , @entity19 has seen a flurry of new bidders keen to get hold of the model 's latest offerings that are quickly selling out online and in store			1
however , if bidders want to be in with a chance with getting their hands on the collection their budget may need to be more suited to @entity258 than @entity10 ... metallic jacquard blazer the jacket that @entity3 wore to last night 's launch that is priced at £ 120 is now selling on @entity19 for over the double the price at £ 300			1
