@entity0 has insisted that @entity1 wo n’t crumble under the pressure of managing @entity3			1
the @entity4 suffered a @entity6 nightmare in his first major test as the @entity9 champions crashed to a 4 - 1 first leg qualifying defeat to @entity11 in @entity12			1
facing the mountainous task of salvaging a £ 15million bounty in the second leg at @entity16 , @entity1 will miss today ’s friendly with @entity17 in @entity18 to put in extra hours on the training field with key first - team players at @entity21 instead			1
disappointing : @entity1 's new @entity3 side slumped to a 4 - 1 defeat to @entity11 joking around : assistant @entity0 will step up against @entity17 assistant manager @entity0 will take charge of a development squad including @entity26 , @entity27 , local boy @entity28 and @entity29 against a star - studded @entity17 side			1
claiming @entity1 will prove his critics wrong after criticism of his team selection and tactics in midweek , @entity0 said : ‘ @entity1 is a strong character			1
he has been a manager for a number of years			1
‘ we have all been in situations where matches have n’t gone your way			2
‘ as a manager , as a player and a coach , you look forward to the next game and trying to put it right			1
‘ first and foremost we look forward to tomorrow ’s game with the young boys			1
‘ then on wednesday we try to put in a good performance and try to get the result			2
’ @entity1 has come under fire for throwing new arrival @entity54 straight into the @entity57 clash just 48 hours after he signed a six - month loan deal			1
disappointing : there were no excuses for the @entity9 champions ' poor defeat in @entity12 the @entity4 had played just 72 minutes of first - team football since signing for @entity64 in january and his selection raised eyebrows , as did @entity1 ’s decision to pick @entity69 ahead of @entity70 at left back			1
insisting @entity3 are still in the tie after surviving two missed @entity11 penalties , however , @entity0 shrugged : ‘ if you are a manager you get these nights , disappointments and great results			1
‘ it ’s all about trying to bounce back from the disappointments and go again			2
‘ you ca n’t feel sorry for yourself			2
you have to dust yourself down and get ready for wednesday			2
‘ we know it ’s a big task			0
but we ’ll have a good support cheering us on – which we know will happen , they ’ll get behind the team			0
‘ and we have to respond by coming out of the blocks with high tempo , putting them under pressure			2
’ insisting @entity1 never planned to travel to @entity89 for today ’s @entity17 game irrespective of the @entity11 result , @entity0 declared : ‘ that was always going to be the case no matter how the result went in midweek - but we just need to get ready and turn it around			1
tough test : @entity0 must try to lead a despondent team against @entity17 in @entity89 ‘ obviously it ’s squeezed between the two big games so it would n’t have been wise to bring the first team out here – a three - hour flight , lots of travelling , so they ’re at home resting , preparing for a big game on wednesday			1
‘ they worked today , they ’ll be working on saturday , and then have sunday off , ready to go again			0
‘ the game in midweek was a disappointment			0
the first half was going along fine but going down to 10 men makes it difficult			0
and to lose the two late goals makes it a tough task			0
‘ it ’s only half time though - and we have goalscorers in the team			2
‘ i ’m sure we ’ll create plenty chances , we just have to take them and keep it tight at the back			0
‘ it ’s a different ball game at home with the fans behind us			0
if we can get an early goal and light up the stadium , give the players energy , that ’s the target			0
’ @entity0 was unable to cast any light on reports from @entity135 that @entity136 want to sign @entity29 on a season - long loan deal			1
‘ i do n’t anything about that			0
i have n’t heard but it could well be true , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s not managed to break in and become a regular			0
but he has scored a few goals coming on as a substitute			0
but we ’re strong in that department with ( @entity144 ) @entity143 and ( @entity146 ) @entity145 and @entity28			0
so it ’s been tough for him			0

@entity3 lost 4 - 1 to @entity11 in first leg of @entity6 qualifir
but @entity0 insists @entity1 wo *n't* crumble under the pressure
