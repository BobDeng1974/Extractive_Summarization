ruling : @entity0 said blind or partially - sighted pedestrians would be vulnerable silent but potentially deadly electric cars will have to be fitted with artificial ‘ sound generators ’ so blind and partially sighted pedestrians can hear them coming , the @entity2 voted today			1
it is part of new @entity8 legislation which will also require conventional cars and lorries with petrol and diesel engines to make 25 per cent less noise			1
the @entity14 voted to introduce mandatory ‘ acoustic vehicle alerting systems ’ ( @entity17 ) – sounding like a conventional engine - to all new electric and hybrid cars to protect vulnerable road users			0
it follows lobbying from @entity23 meps and campaign groups including @entity25			0
electric cars and plug - in hybrid cars such as the all - electric @entity28 or the @entity29 currently emit very little sound when running on electric power only			0
campaigners say this particularly dangerous for partially - sighted and blind pedestrians			0
earlier proposals from the @entity35 called for the installation of an artificial sound system to be done on a voluntary basis only			0
but @entity0 @entity14 successfully introduced an amendment making this a mandatory requirement for all electric and hybrid vehicles			1
following the vote manufacturers in the @entity8 will have five years to comply with the new rules			1
the @entity2 reported that ‘ it is important to provide protection to blind and other vulnerable people through the installation of appropriate vehicle alerting systems in electric vehicles			1
’ it noted : ’ the @entity2 and @entity51 have agreed that such systems should be mandatory			2
’ clean energy : electric cars are being used more as councils install charging points such as this one in @entity57 the @entity35 said : ‘ so - called " @entity59 " requirements shall ensure that only adequate sound generating devices are used			0
‘ the fitting as such will be mandatory for all electric and hybrid electric vehicles after a transitional period of five years			2
' this will increase road safety and undoubtedly help avoiding road - accident injuries			0
’ @entity0 @entity69 environment spokesman @entity68 said : ’ quiet electric cars could become a common sight on our roads in years to come but we have to ensure that this does n't jeopardise the safety of blind and partially - sighted people			1
‘ the acoustic warning devices will make a sound very similar to that of cars with a regular combustion engine so that people will be able to clearly hear these vehicles , allowing them to judge how safe a road is to cross			2
silent : models such as the @entity29 currently make almost no noise when running on electric power alone ‘ installing sound generators will ensure that all pedestrians are able to hear these vehicles and cross the road safely			2
‘ by working at an @entity8 level we have been able to place this requirement on all car manufacturers and prevent needless accidents in future			0
’ the introduction of artificial engine noise to silent electric cars came as the @entity2 voted to decrease noise by four decibels for conventional passenger cars , vans , buses and coaches , and by three decibels for trucks			1
the @entity35 said : ' altogether , these measures will reduce vehicle noise nuisance by some 25 per cent			1

major ruling was *prompted* by @entity0 in @entity2
the rules also require *traditional* engines to make 25 per cent less noise
manufacturers across @entity69 have five years to comply with the new rules
