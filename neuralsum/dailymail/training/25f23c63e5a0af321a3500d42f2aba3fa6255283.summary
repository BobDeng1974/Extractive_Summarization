@entity0 who was sacked by @entity1 this week after it was discovered he lied on his cv had previously lied his way into a job at the @entity5 the man who was fired from @entity1 on monday after it was revealed that he had lied about his credentials was reported to police in january for doing the same thing to another company			1
@entity0 was hired by the @entity11 ( @entity5 ) in december after he provided references and credentials that turned out to be false			1
a spokesman for the chamber said he had used the name ' @entity0 ' when he was hired			2
the name he used for the job at @entity1 was ' @entity18 ' - but the spokesman confirmed to the @entity19 : ' it is the same guy '			1
' the references he had at the time sounded like great references , but when people looked into it further , they realised that things did n't add up , his claims did n't match what was on his resume , ' he said			2
the spokesperson said that mr @entity0 provided the @entity5 with different references to the ones he gave @entity1 and that they were ' more suited to our needs '			1
' i 'd say he 's stupid and smart			0
he 's playing the game , he tailored his resume , which everyone does , but he went way overboard with having the right references and obviously the references were bogus			0
' the spokesperson did not know how mr @entity0 was recruited for the role , which was a national one and would have seen him fly across the country , but added that the job had been advertised on @entity44			0
mr @entity0 was hired in december 2013 but took a holiday immediately afterwards			0
he ' was n't operational until early january , and was asked to resign in mid to late january			0
' the @entity5 then reported the whole incident to the police , the spokesman said			0
mr @entity0 also managed to dupe the @entity5 , fooling them with a fake cv last december @entity18 was fired from @entity1 on monday on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development			1
he claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of @entity56 for @entity57 , the @entity58 company that owns popular fashion chain , @entity60			1
however , @entity57 contacted @entity1 on monday , just hours after mr @entity0 started work at the company , to inform @entity1 that mr @entity0 had never worked for them			1
mr @entity0 was interviewed by the recruitment company several times and transcripts of those interviews were sent to @entity1			2
@entity67 also conducted reference checks , contacting local and overseas referees			0
it is unclear how mr @entity0 fooled @entity1 , @entity67 and the other companies interested in employing him			2

@entity1 hired mr @entity0 as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on monday , but was fired before the end of the day @entity1 ceo @entity81 was not the only one to be fooled , several other companies considered mr @entity0 for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume			1
