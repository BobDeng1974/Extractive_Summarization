by @entity0 @entity1 has vowed to fight @entity2 all the way after describing @entity5 ’s expulsion from the @entity6 as ‘ devastating ’			1
in a brief spell as a @entity9 defender the @entity7 suffered five straight defeats in @entity13 games			2
wednesday ’s 3 - 0 loss to @entity15 – the goals scored by @entity2 ’s @entity18 body - was by far the hardest to accept			1
@entity5 ’s misfortune is difficult to overstate			1
a catalogue of painful ‘ ifs ' : if @entity22 fails to score an away goal @entity15 are out			1
if their captain @entity24 scores one of two penalties @entity15 are out			1
if they leave @entity28 on the bench for the last three minutes of a 6 - 1 aggregate victory @entity15 are out			1
if they name the defender in their squad for the last round clash with @entity34 and if @entity2 ’s match delegate fails to spot the discrepancy @entity15 ’s final chance is gone			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity39 following @entity15 's defeat on wednesday fighting talk : @entity5 boss @entity1 has promised to challenge @entity2 's decision reprieve ? @entity2 have launched an investigation into @entity15 's @entity6 defeat to @entity5 @entity28 is a @entity45 international who has won two caps for his country			1
he started his career at @entity49 in 2009 before joining @entity5 in 2013			1
the 22 - year - old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against @entity54 in the @entity55			1
he could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against @entity59 's but @entity5 failed to register the defender for those matches allowing @entity1 to choose from his full compliment of 25 players			1
compounding @entity5 ’s anguish is the discomfort of a @entity55 trip to @entity67 to face @entity68			1
@entity2 will tolerate no ritualistic slaughter of sheep which overshadowed @entity15 ’s visit last year			1
but the @entity73 side have been spared a trip back			2
and for that , the @entity5 official responsible for the most catastrophic admin error in @entity6 history will do well to escape the cut			1
' we will definitely appeal , ' said @entity1 of the verdict			2
' we will appeal it all the way			0
' how far ? as far as we can because we do n’t think this is the right decision			2
' legia argue the punishment does not fit the crime			0
club official @entity88 blamed human error for failing to register @entity90 for the previous qualifying games against @entity34 - meaning those did n’t count toward his three - game suspension imposed last season			1
' the proportion between the error and the consequences is unimaginable , ' @entity88 told reporters after getting @entity2 ’s verdict			1
' the spirits of the players are broken			0
' legia have five days to request written reasons for the decision and another three days from the receipt of those reasons to register an appeal			2
if the appeal fails they then have the option of taking the matter to @entity112 in @entity113			0
but @entity2 have been consistent in their punishment of clubs fielding suspended players , imposing 3 - 0 defeats on the perpetrators as standard			1
suspended : defender @entity28 came of for the final few minutes of the game @entity5 midfielder @entity121 gave a scathing assessment of @entity15 's performance after the first leg , he said : ' @entity59 's playerd a lot tougher against us than @entity15			1
they gave us a very tough game in @entity129			0
' with @entity15 , we did n't know what to expect , but we were expected to easily beat the @entity132 side , which we did , but only after a big fright and a good performance away			1
fortunately , we regained our composure and we are now on the right track			0
' @entity1 cites an instance from 2010 when the governing body fined @entity139 £ 15,000 but rejected an attempt by opponents @entity141 to have them kicked out of the tournament			0
@entity139 stressed that they had fielded @entity146 in good faith as a substitute in @entity149 when they were already leading 4 - 1 on aggregate			1
crucially , @entity146 was ineligible , not suspended			2
through @entity2 eyes there is a difference			1
' we worked so hard to get to this position with two fantastic games against @entity15			2
' and then everything is taken away			0
' we acted in good faith			0
we made a mistake with the papers for the @entity59 ’s two games			0
' the player knew he was suspended for three games and did n’t play in the two games against @entity165 or the first game against @entity15			1
' it ’s very , very difficult to take and i think this goes against every intention of fair play and fair competition			2
' you look at @entity174 from @entity175 also used a player who was ineligible , but @entity2 fined them because they claimed they acted in good faith and it did not affect the result			2
' so for them to act different this time is really , really very disappointing			0
' we think this is against the very intention of football			0
' @entity186 football should be about fair play and unfortunately a technical error has been made in our administration to not register his name on a piece of paper when he could n’t play because he was suspended			2
' to throw us out of the @entity6 for this is difficult to take			0
' for us to get this kind of punishment for this kind of mistake in this situation and take away the dream of these players to compete against the best players in the world on this stage is devastating			0
' in an open letter to fans on @entity5 ’s official website , club chairman @entity205 expressed his disappointment with the decision , but appeared to accept the @entity2 decision , making no mention of an appeal			1
' we won two matches with class , ' he said			0
' but we made a mistake on paper and this year we lost the chance to play in the coveted @entity6			2
the error that should not happen			0
' although the punishment is disproportionate and it is difficult to reconcile with her , now the more we have to show that this club has great character			0
@entity225 is on : @entity226 ( left ) sitting beside assistants @entity227 and @entity229 has suffered an horrendous start as @entity15 boss following the @entity233 failure to reach the group stage ' we showed that we can play football at a good @entity186 level			1
that change is for the better			0
our players and coaching staff did not disappoint			0
we ’re going in the right direction and show it , fighting for the @entity55 and defending the @entity45 championship			0
' as an organisation we have a job to support our players and fans			0
today we have to apologise and stay together			0
' although today sport lost behind closed doors we promise that never again will not make that mistake			0
in this year in the @entity55			0
in the future the @entity6			0
' many in @entity45 are less accepting of the decision , former national team goalkeeper and @entity5 player @entity257 branding the decision ‘ a tragedy and scandal ’			1
' it ’s a tragedy			0
culpable negligence on the part of @entity5 , ' thundered @entity257			2
' but this should be a financial penalty , not a walkover for @entity15			2
' @entity28 came off the bench when it was an aggregate scoreline of 6 - 1 to @entity5			1
' his presence had no influence on the result whatsoever			0
this confirms that the @entity6 is only for the rich			0
' hopeful : @entity15 fans , pictured ahead of wednesday 's night clash at @entity277 , will be hoping for a reprieve			1

@entity5 fielded defender @entity28 was suspended after red card last season
@entity15 handed 3 - 0 win in second leg meaning they *progress* on away goals
@entity226 's side go into the draw for the play - off round
@entity5 chairman @entity205 also vowed to challenge @entity2 's decision
@entity15 drawn against @entity294 champions @entity293 in the play - off round
