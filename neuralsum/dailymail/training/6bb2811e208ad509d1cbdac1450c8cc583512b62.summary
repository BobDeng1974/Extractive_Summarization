by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 09:15 est , 30 march 2013 the gilded interior of @entity2 will be familiar to legions of @entity5 fans as home to the aristocratic @entity8 family			0
but the stately home played host to some less dignified scenes in the past , when it served as the location for an orgy in @entity15 's film @entity14			1
the 1999 film is one of many the legendary @entity18 director - who was rumoured to be terrified of flying - shot in his adopted home of @entity20 , and the @entity22 mansion is one of a host of unlikely locations around @entity26 that pop up in @entity15 's work			1
@entity2 : the stately home in @entity22 - the real - life location of @entity5 - doubled as a grand @entity31 mansion in @entity32 what would the @entity33 say ? @entity15 filmed the orgy scene in @entity14 at @entity2 - also the setting for television 's @entity5 much of the action in his cult war film @entity39 unfolds in the steamy jungles of @entity42 , but many of the iconic movie 's scenes were actually filmed in a gritty corner of east @entity47			2
anglophile : @entity49 - born @entity15 moved to the @entity20 permanently in the early 1960s @entity50 used imported palm trees to help transform fields in the @entity54 and @entity55 countryside into the landscape of 1960s @entity42 in @entity39 , while @entity22 's @entity2 - otherwise known as television 's @entity5 - doubled as a lavish @entity31 mansion for the orgy scene in @entity14			2
many less - than salubrious @entity47 landmarks can be spotted when watching @entity15 's 1971 film @entity61 - from the @entity63 underpass where the ' droogs ' attack a homeless man , to grim @entity67 tower blocks that loom in the background as @entity69 and his gang stalk the streets			2
the notoriously demanding director is said to have agonised over finding the right location to shoot his films , and spent two months poring over a decade 's worth of architectural magazines before settling on the appropriate settings for @entity61			0
the director eventually chose the @entity81 housing estate as the backdrop for @entity69 's crime spree , and @entity86 lake , @entity87 , and @entity63 all feature in the movie			0
@entity49 - born @entity15 moved to the @entity20 permanently in the early 1960s after becoming disenchanted with @entity89 following studio disputes surrounding the western @entity91 , which he had been slated to direct			1
@entity93 , the film 's star , eventually directed the picture himself			0

his first @entity20 film was @entity129 , an adaptation of @entity132 's classic novel , in 1962 , which saw @entity15 use a suburban house in @entity135 as the @entity137 home of character @entity138			2
sci - fi favourite 2001 : a @entity140 , which became an instant cult classic in 1968 , was also shot largely in @entity26 , including at @entity143 's @entity142 , while the creepy @entity144 from @entity15 's psychological horror @entity146 was created at @entity147 in @entity148 - then the largest set ever built			1
