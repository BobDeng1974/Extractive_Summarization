nailed it : @entity1 , @entity2 , 69 , saw off the threat from @entity4 , who withdrew their plan to open a new shoe repair outlet nearby these days independent shops are all too often struggling and the future looked especially bleak for cobbler @entity2			1
with @entity4 planning to open a shoe repair outlet in the supermarket car park opposite , he feared it was the death knell for the little shop that has been his pride and joy , not to mention his livelihood , for 30 years			1
so the 69 - year - old shopkeeper from the small town of @entity21 in the @entity22 wrote to the store chain ’s chairman sir @entity23 to express his worries … and in a remarkable @entity28 versus @entity27 victory , @entity4 withdrew its planning application			1
mr @entity2 , who was backed by a petition from 250 customers , said : ‘ you ca n’t let these big businesses steamroller the smaller shops			0
‘ i am not against competition , but as a single trader i could n’t have competed with a business on a car park supported by such a huge supermarket chain that could open from 8am to 7pm seven days a week			0
‘ besides , there are plenty of empty shops in @entity21 high street			0
’ in what may seem as a surprisingly humane response from the world of big business , @entity4 described the support he received from his customers as ‘ heart - warming ’ and even invited him to have coffee with the local supermarket ’s manager			2
mr @entity2 has run @entity56 since 1984			2
he refuses to retire because he enjoys his work so much			0
like many high streets , @entity21 ’s has been hit by competition from out - of - town shopping centres as well as online shopping			2
mr @entity2 found out about the @entity63 ‘ pod ’ offering shoe , phone and watch repairs , plus dry cleaning , photo id , key cutting and engraving services , from a planning notice that was stuck on a lamppost near his shop			1
@entity63 , which opened its 1,000th shop in @entity76 in january , announced plans to open at least 150 branches during 2014			1
despite objections from traders to the branch at @entity21 , planning officers recommended councillors approve the application , which was made by @entity4			1
they said they accepted there were empty shops in the high street but pointed out that the pod was very small and retailers were welcome in the town centre			0
sole trader : mr @entity2 has owned @entity92 for 30 years the application was due before @entity94 this week , but was ditched by @entity4 last week			1
@entity95 , a @entity4 customer services executive , wrote to mr @entity2 saying she was sorry the proposal had caused him so much worry and telling him that she had contacted the local store and @entity4 ’s planning department ‘ to see if we could have this decision overturned ’			1
she added : ‘ given the overwhelming support you received from the residents of @entity21 , they have all agreed it would be wrong to open a @entity63 ’s in this store			2
‘ it was heart - warming to see the support you received from your customers			0
we realise how important your business is to them and are happy to support your continued presence in the high street			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ i have done my little bit for my business and i appreciated @entity4 ’s decision			2
you have to help yourself sometimes			0
’ he added : ‘ i want to thank customers and fellow traders for their tremendous support			0
’ mr @entity2 has put the letter he received from @entity4 in his shop window			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ we always try and do the right thing for the communities we serve			0

@entity2 , of @entity21 , @entity130 , opened his shop , @entity92 , in 1984 and said it **'s** his pride and joy
the 69 - year - old feared his livelihood was *doomed* when a nearby @entity4 store announced plans for new shoe repair outlet
he wrote to chain **'s** chairman , sir @entity23 , to express concerns
amazingly - @entity4 has granted his wish and withdrawn planning application
