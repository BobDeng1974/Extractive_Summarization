by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 19 august 2013 @entity2 military units in @entity3 are in the midst of the biggest force pullout in @entity2 history and it 's resulting in the biggest yard sale of military hardware in @entity2 history			2
an estimated $ 50billion in military hardware - from armored vehicles to dining room sets , combat uniforms to vending machines - must be removed from the country by the end of 2014			1
the cost of bringing equipment home is reach an estimated $ 6billion			1
more than a decade of war is nearly over and the military no longer has use for much of the equipment			2
as a result , billions worth of hardware is being auctioned off online - much of it even available to civilians in the @entity2 pulling out : billions of dollars worth of military equipment must be airlifted out of @entity3 as @entity2 troops prepare to pullout at the end of next year billions of dollars more is being scrapped and sold for scrap metal at pennies on the pound			1
the military is rushing to clear everything out of @entity3 , or risk it falling into @entity37 hands when @entity2 forces leave at the end of 2014			1
@entity40 reports that the online auction site @entity42 is gearing up to handle billions of dollars worth of surplus sales in online auctions			1
the site generated more than $ 500million for the @entity2 treasury by 2011 - before the massive draw - down efforts even began			0
the operation , called a retrograde , is complicated by the fact that the military must move nearly all of the equipment out of @entity3 before it can sell it			2
@entity55 for the @entity56 : much of the equipment will wind up being sold on @entity42 , an online auction site for surplus military goods most of potential buyers , even allied militaries , are n't in a position to collect the equipment from war - torn @entity3			1
the @entity3 military , already overburdened with the logistics of training and fielding a security force , can not handle much influx of @entity2 equipment and @entity2 commanders fear that just dumping the hardware on the @entity56 would result in much of it falling into disuse or , worse , into enemy hands			1
as a result , millions of tons of equipment must be shipped out of country , either by air freight or overland through @entity80 - both costly propositions			0
' we ’re making history doing what we ’re doing here , ' major general @entity82 , the commander of the @entity83 , told the @entity88			0
down the drain : some 2,000 @entity91 vehicles are being torn down for scrap in @entity3 because the military does n't need them anymore and can not sell them ' this is the largest retrograde mission in history			1
' the transport numbers are staggering			0
the military will move 95,000 cargo containers out of @entity3 and 35,000 vehicles			1
but , despite the military 's claim of efficiency , there are casualties - billions being wasted			0
the military own 25,500 @entity91 ( @entity91 ) vehicles across the globe - including 11,000 in @entity3			2
the vehicles were hastily - developed to cope with the @entity110 threat of fighting an insurgency			0
in the rush to bring them to the battlefield , the military built too many			0
a report predicted that the military no longer has use for 12,300 of those vehicles - nearly half of the current inventory			0
as a result , 2,000 of the @entity91 - which cost taxpayers $ 1million each to build - are being torn down and sold for scrap			0
the metal is worth pennies on the pound in the @entity3 scrap market , the @entity88 reports .			0

military equipment from 12 years of war must be out of @entity3 by the end of 2014
billions will be sold online on the auction site @entity42
cost to ship 95,000 cargo containers and 35,000 vehicles home will be $ 6billion
equipment can not be given to the @entity3 military and most buyers ca n't pick it up from @entity3 , so it must be shipped home
