by @entity0 @entity1 has been left baffled by @entity3 's ' strange ' performance during a collision - fuelled @entity5 @entity4			1
the two former @entity7 team mates got in a tangle as @entity3 attempted a pass on lap 30 during a charge up from 20th on the @entity12 grid to a third place finish behind @entity15 team mate @entity14			1
it was the last of three separate incidents involving @entity3 and ended up @entity1 running over the left - wing endplate of his fellow @entity20 's car			1
@entity3 said : ' i had a little bit of a collision with @entity1			2
' i honestly thought he was opening the door to let me past			0
he 's been a bit like that in the past , for example , so my bad judgement there			0
' @entity1 was left surprised by @entity3 's remarks as he said : ' why would we let anyone through ? success : @entity3 holds the trophy above his head after a podium finish and ( right ) @entity1 partial retraction : @entity1 later tweeted and said he may have ' overreacted ' @entity54 uses local knowledge to triumph ' i do n't know if you 've noticed , but a lot of drivers do that line to get a good exit from the corner			1
' i think the problem with @entity3 is he expected me to let him past , but i do n't think i 'm the only person he drove into			2
' it 's strange , but when the car 's so much quicker you 'd think he would n't get into so many fights , but there you go			0
' he drove into my rear wheel , that 's all i 've got to say and i do n't know much else about it			0
' i 'm out there doing my race			0
it would make it boring if we all let him past when he was coming through the field			0
' sort that out : @entity3 's @entity15 gets some @entity80 after the bash it took during his attempted overtake			1

@entity3 *battled* up from 20th on the grid to finish in third
but his race was him involving in three collisions , one with @entity1
*fourth* - placed @entity1 *expresses* surprise at @entity3 's claims that he let him through
@entity1 has earlier run over fellow @entity20 's left - wing endplate
