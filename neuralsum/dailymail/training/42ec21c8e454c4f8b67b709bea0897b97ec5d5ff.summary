the video shows actors playing office workers , fleeing a building , hiding under desks and barricading themselves in darkened rooms			2
as well as offering practical such as keeping quiet , switching mobile phones to silent and taking cover out of the line of fire , the clip also shows a worker grabbing a pair of scissors and brandishing them like a weapon			0
the scene is accompanied by advice from the narrator who warns : ' if you are caught out in the open and can not conceal yourself or take cover , you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available			0
' plan ahead : the video warns workers to identify escape routes from their building be prepared : according to @entity6 it is best to have a plan in mind should a gunman attack @entity41 : workers sitting around a meeting table learn that there is a gunman in the building and leap up from their seats safety : the workers hide under the meeting table get out : the video recommends fleeing the building if it is safe to do so safety first : a homeland security clip suggests arming yourself with a pair of scissors if a crazed gunman attacks your workplace the narrator sagely suggests locking the door of your hiding place or blocking the door with heavy furniture			1
