it will disturb @entity8 supporters even more , though , simply because it is indicative of changed circumstances			1
during the golden years , only the really big teams came to @entity12 with victory in mind			0
now , that invitation is open to any side who have the courage and nerve to take it			0

@entity110 was the @entity21 boss who put one over @entity111 , thanks to two goals by @entity114			1
it was @entity8 ’s only home defeat that season but since then @entity21 had lost 16 and drawn three			1
@entity5 ’s team did n’t win this match with a smash and grab			0
it was no backs - to - the - wall , hang - on - and - hope operation			0
not a bit of it			0
@entity21 came to @entity125 looking to outplay @entity8 , while @entity21 ’ manager came to prove himself tactically more astute than the compatriot with whom he once worked fractiously at @entity128			1
as the result suggests , both plans worked			0
the winning goal in the 69th minute , from @entity132 substitute @entity24 , surprised nobody , while @entity8 ’s jumbled attacking formation failed to produce anything resembling a chance until @entity63 missed a couple of opportunities late on			1
@entity21 goalkeeper @entity78 had to be vigilant but no more than that			1
he wo n’t be washing his gloves this week , so rarely did he have to use them			0
an interesting fact — the one that dominated social - media chat at full - time — was that @entity8 ended the game without registering a shot on target			1
that put @entity68 ’s suggestion that @entity8 had ‘ deserved to win ’ into its proper context and was indicative of the home team ’s impotence in the final third of the field			2
@entity79 posted this photo of the dressing room celebrations , writing : ' fantastic result ! ! ! it was a great performance from the lads			0
fans were great as usual @entity161 ' @entity63 ( right ) missed a number of good chances to level the scores shortly after @entity21 went ahead against @entity8 @entity63 ( centre ) looks on as another chance of his drifts the wrong side of the post for @entity8 @entity8 captain @entity68 cut a dejected figure as he left the pitch after the full time whistle was blown @entity64 stares at the ground in reaction to the full time whistle being blown @entity176 ( second right ) is dispossessed by @entity21 midfielder @entity86 in a subdued first half @entity87 ( right ) of @entity21 gets past @entity178 ( left ) of @entity8 on his debut for @entity5 's team @entity68 ( centre ) is closed down by @entity21 captain @entity51 ( right ) and his defensive partner @entity183 ( left ) perhaps equally as pertinent , though , was that this was a game that ended with no late cavalry charge from @entity8			1
here at @entity12 , @entity8 teams used to view the possibility of victory for their opponents as an affront to their pride , as an insult even			2
even on the days they did lose , they did so while threatening to kick the door down			0
not on sunday , though			0
@entity197 made late substitutions and changed things round a bit			0
he pushed @entity68 up the middle and threw on @entity67 to try to unsettle @entity202 still ended the game quietly , though			0
young striker @entity75 remained on the substitutes ’ bench while @entity207 — £ 280,000 - a - week @entity207 — watched from afar , having failed to make the squad			0
it was all a little odd , but then maybe not that odd at all			0
for this is the type of thing that always looks as though it may happen to @entity8 these days			2
the misery and defeatism of @entity217 ’s time at @entity8 has disappeared but a vulnerability remains			2
indeed , @entity197 ’s @entity8 have the same number of points that @entity217 ’s team did after the same number of games			1
@entity5 was gracious afterwards but still struck a relevant theme when he mentioned the ‘ difficulties ’ of @entity8 ’s three central defenders			2
he also stated that victory had not surprised him			0
‘ it is a good feeling , ’ he said			0
‘ certainly it ’s better than how i felt when @entity8 beat us at @entity21			1
’ @entity79 ( right ) gave an excellent display against @entity8 and kept @entity66 subdued throughout the game @entity233 ( right ) tussles for the ball with substitute @entity70 ( left ) of @entity8 in @entity21 's win @entity85 ( right ) and @entity86 impressed in defensive midfield positions for @entity21 @entity21 defender @entity80 went down injured after 20 minutes and had to be taken off , with @entity183 his replacement @entity80 ( right ) was visibly upset at picking up an injury as he limped off the pitch at @entity12 @entity5 gives instructions to his team during the victory against @entity8 defeat for @entity8 means @entity1 's side drop below @entity21 and go fourth in the @entity102 table 37 – @entity1 has the same number of points as @entity217 after 21 @entity102 games 6 – @entity249 completed six more passes than @entity176 ( 13 ) 0 – the number of shots @entity8 had on target – the first time since may 2009 against @entity255 27 – the amount of years since @entity21 last won at @entity12 that comment referred to @entity8 ’s 2 - 1 win in @entity259 before @entity260			1
it was a victory @entity8 did n’t deserve and @entity21 played as though they had vengeance in mind			1
right back @entity79 almost scored in the first minute – exchanging passes with @entity89 and shooting across goal — and although that did n’t exactly set the tone , it highlighted a mindset that served @entity21 well throughout			1
@entity197 said rather tetchily later that @entity21 had come for a draw and got lucky			2
@entity5 ’s plan was to stifle the flow of @entity8 possession that stems from @entity64 — he man - marked him with @entity275 — and then build from there			2
in the first half there were some half - chances for @entity8 but no more			1
they did enjoy territory but looked terribly one - paced			0
@entity176 drove one shot across goal and another wide from the edge of the penalty area			2
@entity53 , meanwhile , saw an effort blocked			0
the second half , though , was more telling			0
@entity68 ( right ) fails to connect with a cross into the area as @entity8 chased an equalizer that never arrived @entity183 ( centre ) leaps up to head clear a cross in the final minutes of the game @entity86 ( right ) caused @entity8 problems all day by breaking up a number of @entity8 's attacks @entity21 defender @entity82 ( left ) gets across to tackle @entity178 in an impressive display on the left the result means @entity8 have dropped into fourth place and are only a point higher than @entity255 once @entity21 take the lead , they often hang on			1
@entity5 ’s side have only dropped two points from leading positions this season , the best in the @entity102			2
@entity21 began brightly , and @entity233 and @entity89 were denied by interventions from @entity45 and @entity65 respectively			1
@entity89 also headed wide from a corner before , with 21 minutes to go , @entity8 ’s defence was breached			1
it was @entity24 ’s vision that did the damage			2
he seemed to have his head down amid a sea of red after @entity8 had failed to clear a long pass to the edge of their own area			1
but somehow the @entity21 man spotted @entity89 unmarked to his right and squeezed the ball out to his team - mate			1
one on one with @entity47 , @entity89 should have scored , but even though his shot rebounded from the near post , @entity24 was alert enough and calm enough to side - foot the ball back into the empty goal from 15 yards			1
there was still time for @entity8 and @entity63 could — maybe should — have scored late on			2
twice @entity329 provided the @entity331 with good chances but twice he failed to hit the target			1
soon after , he missed again with a half volley			0
in many ways , @entity63 sums up the current @entity8			2
talented but unreliable , only sporadically impressive .			0

@entity21 stifled @entity8 's attack in the first half and neither side managed a shot on target
@entity8 failed to have any extra joy in the second half and @entity21 continued to grow into the game
@entity24 gave @entity21 the three points on 69 after @entity89 hit the post from inside the area
