by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 and @entity4 tormented @entity5 as @entity6 made a bold early statement in title race			1
as @entity9 watched on from the directors ’ @entity11 , @entity12 will have been left to wonder whether his new £ 16million signing will lift @entity5 to @entity6 ’s level			1
@entity3 scored either side of half - time to take the game away from @entity5 , with substitute @entity4 coming off the bench to finish @entity5 off with his first touch , as @entity6 ran out convincing 3 - 1 winners at the @entity21			1
hero : @entity3 scored twice on monday night to help @entity6 to a 3 - 1 win over @entity5 injuries ruined @entity3 ’s first season in @entity26 but he has come back this season in good heart , thriving during @entity6 ’s pre-season tour			1
it led @entity31 to hail the @entity33 ’s performance and the manager insisted he will play a major role in @entity6 ’s quest for honours this season			1
@entity31 said : ‘ we are pleased with @entity3 , he is working hard			1
he was unlucky last season but we never had any doubt of his quality			2
he deserved to start the season as he has done			2
we need four strikers and at this moment @entity3 is doing really well			1
‘ we do n’t forget @entity45 , who was important last year but is injured			2
it is important that we have four strikers			2
when you play at home it is very important to play well against a team like @entity5			1
they will be challenging for the title			2
@entity31 , who insisted that the injury which forced @entity53 off was nothing too serious , added : ‘ we are just starting the season we had a very hard start and it was very important for us to win the second game			1
one up : @entity59 smashes home the opener just before the break as @entity61 looks on ' for me these are games of six points – especially when you play at home			2
for @entity3 to start the season in this way after an unlucky new season is good ’ @entity12 , whose side pulled back a late consolation when @entity73 put past @entity74 under pressure from @entity76 , accepts signing @entity9 is ' a calculated risk ' and has warned the 24 - year - old this is his last chance to thrive at elite level			1
but the @entity5 manager , while irked by some of his team ’s defending , does not believe this was setback will be too costly			1
he warned , though , that the club ’s £ 117million spending spree is no guarantee that they will be successful			1
‘ i think that the market for strikers of that quality ( is tough ) and the deal was very good , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ he is a world class talent and it is an area that we needed to strengthen			2
hopefully we can help him improve as a player and a man			2
i think he can do very well for us			0
slotted home : @entity3 started and finished a move for the second goal , with the assist from @entity103 ‘ i do n’t have any concerns			1
we know he is a football talent			0
there is no big - time charlies in this squad			1
he knows that he needs to fit in to this squad			0
one thing he does n’t lack is confidence			0
he has that football arrogance			0
@entity114 has gone , he brilliant for me for two years but we move on			0
‘ i have been very encouraged by him			0
he knows he has got flaws			0
there is no better club			0
@entity5 is a wonderful club			1
he has already sampled how we work			0
the goals we are disappointed with			0
the first one we were not alert			0
you have to complement their finishing			0
@entity12 added : ‘ you buy players but it does not guarantee you anything			1
i thought up until they scored we were the better side			1
we looked good going forward			2
but we switched off before half - time			2
we started the second half reasonably bright but then gave away poor goals			0
‘ for the new players , it should be reasonable quick			0
there is a period of adaptation			0
we have still got the core and the players will adapt in			0
it will take a bit of time			0
@entity61 showed flashes of his quality			0
we knew there were areas we need to work on			0
@entity140 showed his pace and his quality ’ @entity143 on : @entity31 's side look in good shape after two wins from two difficult games @entity59 deserved this performance - @entity31			1
