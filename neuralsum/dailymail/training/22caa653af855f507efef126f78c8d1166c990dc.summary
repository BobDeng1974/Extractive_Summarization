what might be particularly upsetting for the giver , however , is that some of them have n’t even been unwrapped			0
a blind auction : one @entity15 seller has put her unwanted @entity4 presents from her ex-boyfriend on @entity15 - still unwrapped more than 3,000 rejected gifts from ex-partners , mother - in - laws , and other relatives have been listed on @entity15 since @entity4			1
many of the items listed are unopened – which means those bidding on the goods are taking a gamble on what ’s inside			1
