by @entity0 the food industry lobby has been given unprecedented access to the heart of government , a @entity2 investigation has found			1
fast food companies , supermarkets , restaurant chains and chocolate and fizzy drinks firms have had dozens of meetings with ministers			2
yet health campaigners say they have been shunned – at a time when the @entity16 has been resisting calls for tough laws to restrict the amount of sugar in food			1
@entity22 : representatives of @entity24 's met with former public health minister @entity25 , as well as her predecessor @entity26 access : representatives of food giants such as @entity30 , left , and @entity31 , right , were also given access to high - ranking ministers @entity24 ’s , @entity34 , @entity30 , @entity35 ’s and @entity36 are among firms invited to ministerial meetings since the 2010 election			1

last night public health experts said the extraordinary access showed that the government was keener on listening to the food industry than to those with the interest of people ’s health at heart			1
@entity60 , of the @entity61 , said : ‘ these meetings are an example of how the industry has a charmed route into the corridors of power that is denied to everyone else			2
' the fear of people like us is that the government secretly sews things up on the industry ’s behalf			2
perhaps if the government were n’t so influenced by them , we would have a maximum sugar level in foods by now			2
’ campaigners say that without tough action to tackle obesity , which can lead to diabetes , heart disease , stroke and cancer , the @entity80 could go bankrupt			2
the revelation comes weeks after it emerged that drinks industry representatives met dozens of ministers and officials before the government ’s decision to drop plans for a minimum alcohol pricing			1
today a study published in the @entity96 says there is a correlation between countries with few regulations on food production and those with consumption of unhealthy fast foods			0
meetings : former health secretary @entity106 , left , met with most major supermarkets , @entity108 and food giants @entity110 , while current health secretary @entity111 , right , has attended a meeting with @entity113 researchers say that if governments take action , such as stopping the clustering of fast food outlets on high streets or taxing fizzy drinks , they can help turn the tide against obesity			1
campaign group action on @entity124 , which wants laws to force manufacturers to cut the sugar content of their products by up to 30 per cent , will tonight have its first meeting with health secretary @entity111 , but hopes of a breakthrough are not high			0
its chairman @entity134 , a professor of cardiovascular medicine who has also led anti-salt campaigns , said : ‘ we rarely get access to ministers – they do n’t want to see us			0
' my impression is that if the food industry want to see them , they get in			1
the food industry is riding all over us			1
‘ i do n’t know what @entity111 will say , but i do n’t think it will be positive			0
’ last month action on @entity124 unveiled research showing that zero - fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar , while a can of @entity155 tomato soup has four			0
the @entity156 has called for a 20 per cent tax on food and drink which has high sugar levels			0

the @entity16 instead wants companies to agree a voluntary cut sugar in levels			0
the @entity168 has published details of ministerial meetings between april 2011 and september 2013 on its website but for unknown reasons was unable to do so for the period from may 2010 to march 2011			0
the details show that big food firms met ministers on average once a month			1
@entity180 ’s public health spokesman @entity178 said : ‘ people will rightly ask why ministers have spent so much time meeting with the fast food and drink industry			1
ministers caved in to vested interests			0
@entity187 has no plan to tackle the obesity epidemic			0
’ public health campaigners also accuse the @entity16 of hampering action to target obesity by its decision to strip responsibility for nutrition from the @entity196 and place it under the political control of the @entity168			1
last night the @entity168 said the meetings with the food industry were about trying to persuade it to improve the healthiness of products			2
‘ improving the public ’s health is a priority , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ we are not giving business , big or small , power over public health policy but food businesses have a big role to play in helping people to lead a healthier life			2
’ @entity214 , spokesman for the @entity41 , said : ‘ the significant commitments developed at those meetings to eliminate artificial trans fats and reduce the saturated fat , salt and calorie content of a wide range of foods as well as providing clear nutrition labelling , have empowered consumers to make dietary choices appropriate to their lifestyle			0
