a patriotic parrot has learned to whistle a famous football anthem to cheer on the @entity3 team during the @entity4 in @entity5			1
the african grey parrot named @entity7 has spent a month learning a rendition of @entity9 in preparation for the @entity4			1
the tune , the soundtrack to the famous war film , is a favourite of the @entity3 supporters band , who follow the team around the world			2
mr @entity20 , 42 , decided to teach the bird the tune after his football - mad six - year - old son , @entity32 , suggested the bird learn a football song to chant along to the matches			1
mr @entity20 said : ' @entity32 is obsessed with the @entity4 and asked if we could teach @entity7 a football anthem			1
' it 's taken us about a month to get him to do it - and now he sings it all the time			0
' he sat on his perch to watch the @entity44 ' game against @entity45 on saturday night and sang the anthem to the football - he sounds just like a rowdy football fan			0
' the nine - year - old exotic bird also makes noises like the football whistles used on the pitch			0
@entity7 , an @entity53 , has also learned to shout ' @entity3 ' and ' @entity29 ' during games after a week of his parrot 's @entity3 chanting , mr @entity20 says the trick is beginning to wear a little thin mr @entity20 says he plans to watch all of @entity3 's @entity4 games with his talented pet			1
he added : ' he is a very clever parrot - when i bought him as a baby the breeder said he would n't start talking until her was eight or nine months old			0
' three months later he was already chattering away - it was just amazing			0
' but mr @entity20 has admitted that since @entity3 's opening 2 - 1 loss to @entity45 , @entity7 's repertoire has become a little tiring			1
he said : ' now he sings it from the moment i take the cover off his cage in the morning until late at night			0
' i ca n't get him to stop singing it - i have to admit it gets a bit annoying			0
it did n't really help when he was squawking @entity9 all day after we lost			0
' over 200 people have seen a clip of the parrot singing which mr @entity20 has posted on @entity82			2
@entity7 can also whistle mr @entity83 and the themes to @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
mr @entity20 chose the @entity9 tune due to it being a favourite of the @entity3 supporters band ( above ) and taught @entity7 the @entity92 chant due to the forward ( below ) being his favourite player			1

@entity7 the @entity53 has learned @entity3 chants and songs
owner @entity20 spent weeks teaching bird ahead of @entity4
the pet can chant ' @entity3 ' and ' @entity29 ' during matches
@entity7 has also learned to whistle national team anthem @entity9
but mr @entity20 admits he 's beginning to grow tired of chants after a week
