@entity1 team principal @entity0 believes it would have been ' wrong ' to have imposed team orders on @entity4 and @entity5 in the @entity6			1
with @entity4 and @entity5 running second and third over the closing laps under the lights of the @entity9 behind race - winner @entity10 , @entity0 could easily have asked them to switch positions			1
@entity5 started the day 72 points behind @entity14 , who retired early on with a wiring loom failure to his steering wheel			2
@entity1 drivers drivers @entity5 and @entity4 after the @entity18 @entity6 team principal @entity0 ( left , with @entity21 supremo @entity20 ) said it would have been ' wrong ' to impose team orders @entity5 speaks to the press after finishing third in the @entity18 @entity6 the @entity25 ended it 60 points adrift of @entity28 , yet that could have been 57 if @entity0 had felt obliged to make a call on position			1
with double points in the final race in @entity35 , and with @entity37 ' reliability record becoming more of an issue , every point could prove vital for @entity5			2
yet a dismissive @entity0 said : ' both mathematically have a chance , even though it 's a long shot			0
' so it 's down to them racing each other on the track			0
it would be wrong to interfere with that in the situation we 're in			0
' @entity5 suggested after the last race in @entity49 it would be beneficial to his cause if the team started to favour him			0
it was @entity37 ' @entity10 who came out on top in @entity18 @entity5 's @entity1 makes its way around the circuit the @entity25 clutches his third - place trophy world champion @entity4 waves to the crowd after finishing second reigning four - time champion @entity4 is now 117 points adrift with 150 available , yet @entity0 added : ' @entity5 is totally comfortable and happy with the situation			1
' if there was a realistic chance of @entity5 winning and @entity4 was mathematically out of the championship then we 'd do the best we can for the team			1
' but as i say , with the situation we 're in at the moment it 's a long shot			0
' with @entity37 consistently tripping over themselves , @entity5 could sneak up on @entity10 and @entity14 come the controversial ending to the campaign			2
despite that , @entity0 said : ' @entity37 have an enormous advantage at this point , but we 'll take it one race at a time			0
' both of them are still just in it , and both have taken a chunk of points out of @entity14			0
' @entity5 , okay he 's conceded three points to @entity89 , but is that going to make the difference ? ' that 's impossible to say with a crystal ball at this stage , but at the moment it does n't make sense to interfere with team orders			1
