this year , the @entity2 has delivered close to £ 200million of aid to the region where the civil war has cost over 100,000 lives and left around 2million people homeless			1
it puts @entity2 ’s contribution at 154 per cent of our ‘ fair share ’ , which would be only £ 125million , according to an analysis by @entity19 of how much money countries are giving to the crisis , relative to their wealth			1
this year , the @entity2 has delivered close to £ 200million of aid to the region where the civil war has cost over 100,000 lives despite having already exceeded this level by £ 68million , the amount delivered so far is only half the £ 400million the government has pledged to hand over since the conflict began two and a half years ago			1

by contrast other major economies have fallen short – with @entity50 and @entity51 handing over just 47 per cent of their fair share , at £ 67million and £ 53million respectively			1
none of the rest of the @entity56 group of countries – including the @entity42 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 – have met their target except the @entity2 and @entity62 according to @entity19			1
the @entity42 is the largest donor delivering over £ 500million this year			2
but given its wealth and population this is only 63 per cent of its fair share which was put at £ 800million			1
@entity71 – a close ally of @entity39 – gave just 3 per cent of what would be expected given the size of its economy , the report found			2
but bottom of the list was @entity78 , whose economy has grown faster than expected this year , but has given just £ 62,000 – 1 per cent of its fair share calculated at £ 6.7million			1
mr @entity34 said earlier this month : ‘ we are already the second largest aid donor in delivering the humanitarian aid that is so needed both in @entity7 and in the neighbouring countries like @entity87 and @entity88			0
we ’ll go on doing that			0
’ despite having already exceeded this level by £ 68million , the amount delivered so far is only half the £ 400million the government has pledged to hand over he said the aid given so far had saved ‘ tens of thousands of lives ’ , and that he would push other countries to do more at the recent @entity56 summit , however many have failed to act			1
@entity99 , @entity19 ’s campaigns manager for the @entity7 response , said : ‘ the crisis has got a lot worse this year and there are still a lot more needs on the ground			1
although our government has given 154 per cent , we would still expect them to give more			2
’ @entity34 has promised the @entity2 will ' lead the world ' on getting food and medical aid to victims of the conflict the charity analysed each countries ’ @entity116 ( @entity116 ) , which is its wealth per head of population , and how much of the millions of pounds it has pledged have actually been delivered to aid workers on the ground			1
the list of nations includes 28 traditional donor countries , and also @entity125 nations who have donated to @entity7 mainly @entity128 countries which support the rebels			0
only eight countries were gauged to be giving sufficient funds , with oil - rich @entity132 the most generous at more than four and a half times its fair share – at £ 200million			1
other countries which exceeded their fair share were @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity19 ’s figures include all the aid given directly and via the @entity143 , @entity144 and charities such as the @entity146 and @entity19 so far this year			1
the head of @entity19 ’s @entity7 programme , @entity147 , said : ‘ while economic times are tough , we are facing the largest man - made humanitarian disaster in two decades and we have to seriously address it			2
‘ the scale of this crisis is unprecedented and some countries must start to show their concerns to the crisis in @entity7 by putting their hands in their pockets			0
this is not the time for pledges			0
the situation demands committed funds in order to save lives			0
’ international development secretary @entity167 visited @entity7 refugees in @entity87 this month , and said : ‘ over one million @entity7 children are now refugees			0
@entity170 have seen unimaginable horrors and all face an uncertain future			0
‘ we must ensure these children have sufficient food , shelter and medical care , but we must also provide the psychological support and education needed for their longer term well - being			0
