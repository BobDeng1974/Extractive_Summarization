the @entity4 , faced with the new @entity0 attracting its lowest crowd for an @entity3 international , have further antagonised the hardcore support base			0
indeed , some fans who have bought tickets for wednesday ’s low - key friendly against @entity9 to secure loyalty points for @entity11 are threatening not to go to the match			1
this makes it even more likely the attendance will be significantly less than the 48,876 who watched a friendly against @entity18 in 2011			2
quiet night : empty seats in the @entity0 stands during the friendly between @entity3 and @entity18 in 2011 loyal fans , who watch the national team home and away , are annoyed that they have to buy seats for three @entity11 qualifiers at @entity0 by monday to qualify for their @entity27 £ 5 discount off the price of a home ticket			2
and the match against @entity31 is not being played until march 2015			0
this follows the @entity4 offering members a £ 5 discount for the @entity9 game , only to drop the price to the general public by £ 10			2
the supporters club were already aggrieved by the @entity4 moving double loyalty points from away match attendance to @entity0 games to help fill the stadium during an ultra-dull @entity44 qualifying campaign			0
fans spokesman @entity45 said : ‘ the @entity4 should be really careful at taking members club support for granted			0
the over-riding desire to fill @entity0 can not come at any cost			0
’ the @entity4 insisted after a @entity50 build - up during which @entity52 ’s @entity3 side spent just two full days at their £ 100million @entity54 national training centre — isolated in the @entity56 countryside near @entity57 — that it will be fully utilised by the senior team in future			0
so where are @entity3 going to stay before wednesday ’s friendly against @entity9 ? the @entity61 outside @entity62 , which is a lot handier for @entity0			1
gather round : @entity3 manager @entity52 ( centre ) leads a training session at @entity54 in may it is highly unlikely following the text exchange scandal that @entity68 leader @entity67 will have former @entity70 manager @entity69 as his personal guest again at the @entity72 anytime soon			1
@entity69 was invited to watch @entity74 ’s questions earlier this year by @entity67 , who attended a @entity76 reception for @entity69 and backroom staff after @entity70 won promotion to the @entity79 in 2013			1
guest : @entity69 was invited by @entity67 to watch prime minister 's questions earlier this year an unprecedented meeting of @entity85 ’s 54 national federations in @entity86 on thursday morning will decide how strongly president @entity87 attacks @entity88 later in the day			1
the powerbrokers have been called to the @entity90 for a summit with no agenda apart from the @entity85 supremo outlining his ambitions around standing against @entity95 for the @entity88 presidency in 2015			1
@entity97 : @entity85 president @entity87 ( left ) stands alongside @entity88 president @entity95 in june @entity87 is not expected to put himself forward , preferring to remain @entity100 ’s football kingpin			1
so @entity85 representatives , having been summoned to @entity100 ’s most expensive location , will at least expect a full - on assault against @entity88 ’s dysfunctional governance when @entity87 speaks to the @entity105 afterwards			1
this would follow on from the strong @entity108 mood — not least from the @entity4 — within @entity85 at the @entity109 in @entity110 before the @entity50			2
@entity87 wants to make a landmark statement , but it is understood his advisors are urging caution			2
@entity115 blow for @entity116 @entity115 indicating she is unlikely to renew her £ 400,000 - a - year contract to present 40 days of @entity119 racing in 2015 really is the death knell for its doomed revamped racing coverage — a spectacular failure since the start of 2013			1
having @entity115 on board was one of the main reasons why @entity127 were originally awarded the production contract			2
and her jumping ship from presenting her specialist sport is the clearest sign that the racing programming has not worked			0
racing is lucky to have two specialist channels screening its meetings , so only the marquee occasions should be sold separately in future			0
and certainly @entity138 would love to be back on @entity139			0
host : @entity115 ( left ) stands alongside @entity141 as she presents @entity142 in 2013 no sooner had @entity143 failed for @entity144 on @entity146 finals day than he was responding to tweets from @entity148 that suggest the cricket mercenary will play in @entity151 ’s @entity146 tournament in november			1
not that @entity143 is delivering value for money , scoring just one half century in 25 t20 innings for @entity156 , @entity144 and @entity157 this year			0
bat in hand : @entity143 ( right ) plays for @entity144 at the @entity159 at @entity160 on saturday			0

some fans who have bought tickets for next wednesday 's friendly against @entity9 are threatening not to go
it is highly unlikely that @entity68 leader @entity67 will have @entity69 as his guest at the @entity72 again
@entity85 's national federations meet in @entity86 on thursday to decide how strongly president @entity87 attacks @entity88
@entity115 has indicated she is unlikely to renew her contract with @entity142
