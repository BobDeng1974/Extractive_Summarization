conservationists are testing technology which could use the ‘ gaps ’ between digital television channels to monitor endangered wildlife in remote areas			1
experts are testing so - called television white space ( @entity8 ) , which can be transmitted over long distances , and through obstacles such as trees , to send footage from remote cameras			1
it is hoped that the vacant frequencies will allow conservationists in the field to accurately monitor areas such as rainforests or deserts , where it has previously been difficult to study wildlife			1
scroll down for live stream examples experts are testing whether so - called television white space ( @entity8 ) , could be used to transmit data over long distances and through obstacles such as trees , to send footage from remote cameras			1
the system could be used to glean fresh information about endangered animals such as tigers ( pictured ) for now , it is being trialled a little closer to home - in @entity34			0
cameras and radios have been installed in animal enclosures to test the use of @entity8 by wirelessly transmitting video live to @entity40 , using @entity44 ’s ‘ spectrum database ’ to make sure they do not interfere with existing channels			2
members of the public will be able tune in and see what the otters , meerkats and giant tortoises are getting up to 24 - hours a day during the two - month trial period			0
‘ with projects in more than 50 countries around the world , @entity54 ’s conservationists work in some of the planet ’s most difficult - to - reach areas , from the vast expanse of the @entity62 desert to the dense jungles of @entity64 , said @entity65 , @entity54 ’s ‘ white spaces for wildlife ’ project co-ordinator			2
‘ remote monitoring of wildlife is a vital conservation tool , from helping us to better understand a species ’ behaviour to detecting activity such as poaching or illegal logging			0
cameras and radios have been installed in animal enclosures at @entity34 to test the use of @entity8 by wirelessly transmitting video live to @entity40 , using @entity44 ’s ‘ spectrum database ’ to make sure they do not interfere with existing channels			2
this is the live meerkat stream it is hoped that the vacant frequencies , between tv channels ( illustraed left ) will allow conservationists in the field to accurately monitor areas such as rainforests or deserts , where it has previously been difficult to study wildlife			1
the technology is being tested in the meerkat enclosure at @entity34 ( shown right ) @entity8 stands for television white space			1
it could be used to ransmit data over long distances and through obstacles such as trees , to send footage from remote cameras			1
it 's hoped that the vacant frequencies will allow conservationists in the field to accurately monitor areas such as rainforests or deserts , where it has previously been difficult to study wildlife			1
the tech is being trialled at @entity34			0

members of the public can tune in and see what the otters , meerkats and giant tortoises are getting up to 24 hours a day during the two - month trial period			0
‘ the prototype systems at @entity34 are already demonstrating that they can transmit high definition video over long distances , confirming their invaluable potential to use wireless connectivity to transform @entity54 ’s worldwide conservation work			1
’ @entity54 said it aims to integrate the technology into its existing ‘ instant wild ’ system , which is used for anti-poaching and wildlife monitoring operations			0
this system allows members of the public to help identify wild animals photographed by motion - activated camera - traps			0
using television white space could significantly boost the range , and capability , of this current system , @entity54 said			1
the scheme is one of a number of trials of new wireless technology , with broadcasting regulator @entity146 working with the industry to see how it might be put into practice - making the @entity150 the first country in @entity151 likely to use it			0
other trials include using @entity8 to provide early flood warnings , by monitoring water levels in real time and sending the information over the white space , and using the technology to provide internet and communications to ferries in the far north of @entity163			2
@entity164 , group director of @entity146 ’s spectrum policy group , said : ‘ in a world where consumers ’ demand for data services is experiencing huge growth , it is essential we find the most efficient ways to share the airwaves			0
‘ white space technology could be one way of meeting this demand			0

the otter live stream is shown above ‘ the prototype systems at @entity34 are already demonstrating that they can transmit high definition video over long distances , confirming their invaluable potential to use wireless connectivity to transform @entity54 ’s worldwide conservation work , ' said @entity54 's @entity65			1
there 's a camera in the tortoise enclosure ( pictured )			0

@entity54 ( @entity54 ) and @entity44 are testing so - called television white space ( @entity8 ) at the capital 's *zoo*
live streams of meerkats , tortoises and otters can be viewed *online*
it can transmit data over long distances and through obstacles such as trees
data and footage is then sent from remote cameras observing rare animals
it 's hoped vacant frequencies will allow conservationists to accurately monitor areas such as rainforests or deserts
