' author and broadcaster @entity117 , who has written about decluttering , said getting rid of clutter makes people feel happier			1
he said : ' the vast majority of @entity8 households underestimate the value of their unwanted items so are n't aware of just how much value is sitting in their cupboards and under their beds			0
' with some people even stashing their clutter in car boots and in washing machines , it 's obvious that it 's time for a spring clean			0
' i 'd urge everyone to set aside a weekend to have a good declutter session and think about what they could sell			0
garden he added : ' many of us upgrade constantly to new technology and we are getting new phones , laptops and mp3 players every year			0
' this is leading to many men having a ' gadget graveyard ' of slightly outdated technology , but technology which is still worth a lot of money			0
' in some cases , very early mobile phones and early home computers , such as the @entity167 , can be worth more money today			0
' i once read that all clutter is postponed decisions , which is an eloquent and revealing description			0
' your motivation really should be to free yourself			0
it 's amazing how good you and your loved ones feel once you 've had fun with a clutterbust			0
' @entity180 , from @entity181 , said : ' for any households looking for a quick and easy way to find extra space in their homes , a good spring clean session can really help			0
' with many homes across the @entity8 now wasting whole rooms storing unwanted items , a good clear out can really make a difference			0
' we 'd urge everyone to try to sell their unwanted items , as chances are , there is probably someone local to you looking for exactly the item that is lurking in your loft or hiding in your shed			0
