by @entity0 turning bad parents into good parents is often the work of social workers , teachers or even a number of tv chat show hosts			0
but research from @entity9 suggests there might be an easier option			1
the scientists claim to have found a ‘ switch ’ in the brain of male mice that can turn troublesome fathers into doting dads			1
research from @entity9 has shown that the level of aggressiveness shown by adult mice to pups can be altered by destroying groups of neurons in their brains			1
this suggests there is a switch that decides how nurturing mammals will be to younglings the study , published in the journal nature , was led by @entity34 , a professor of molecular and cell biology at @entity9			1
the research focuses on a group of neurons in the brains of mice that have been linked to paternal care			1
by shining a light to trigger specific brain cells , the scientists were able to change the approach to parenting of male mice			1
there are , of course , obvious difference between human parenting and mice parenting			2
notably in the former there are a host of complexities involved including social and cultural experiences			0
nonetheless , at a basic level the researchers say the study provides some key insight into how the brain works with regards to parenting			1
‘ the fact that we are mammals means we certainly have those neurons as well , ’ @entity34 told the @entity64			0
and she says while the study only focused on male mice it could just as easily be applied to females			2
indeed , she says that the finding that males and females share this key brain circuit suggests dads have the same potential to be as nurturing as mums			1
true monogamy is rare in the animal kingdom - even in species that appear to mate for life , tests have revealed cheating is commonplace			0
however , a new study by the @entity85 has found @entity87 's owl monkeys buck this trend because they are ‘ unusually faithful			0
’ the investigation of 35 offspring born to 17 owl monkey pairs turned up no evidence of cheating , and the male and female monkeys that cared for the young were the infants ' true biological parents			0
an additional analysis of 15 pair - living mammals found a strong connection between a species ' faithfulness and how much of a role the males took in caring for their young			2
although the research was only carried out in mice , the scientists say the results could also be applied to humans and other mammals			0
however , as human brains are much more complex it would be much harder to replicate the results in people in the research they focused on species of mice where the males were known to attack the children of others			2
but they would cease the aggressive behaviour when their own pups were due , three weeks after mating with a female			0
the researchers searched the brain for the neurons that might be responsible for this change in behaviour and focused on a region known for sensing pheromones			2
these scents influence the behaviour of other animals , and was thought to be important in mating			0
by destroying brain cells in that region , the aggressive nature of virgin male mice was found to drastically decrease			1
instead of attacking young pups , they would nurture them and even build them nests			0
conversely , when they destroyed nerve cells in the middle of the brain in female mice , they made the mothers act more aggressively .			1

study into mice brains reveals a group of neurons that *control* parenting
researchers at @entity9 could alter how aggressive they were
by destroying some neurons they made angry males more nurturing
conversely they were able to make caring females more aggressive
suggests there is a ' switch ' for parenting in the brain of all mammals
