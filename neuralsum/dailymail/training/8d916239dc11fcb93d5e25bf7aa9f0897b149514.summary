@entity4 boss @entity1 was not happy with @entity3 's post-match comments @entity3 said @entity4 's match against @entity16 at the weekend will be like a pub game former @entity4 right back and captain @entity3 has been branded an ' ex-legend ' by @entity19 appearances : 602 honours : eight @entity8 titles three @entity34 cups two @entity35 @entity36 two @entity37 one @entity38 one @entity39 ‘ he can say everything because he is an ex-legend , but as an ex-legend , or as a legend , you have to know what you are saying			1
‘ you can interpret that how you like			2
when i say that , he has to pay attention to his words			2
’ despite @entity19 ’s criticism he admitted @entity4 ‘ got lucky ’ at @entity53 's			1
@entity3 said on @entity54 : ' i do n't think ( they can win the league ) , they do n't have the quality			1
' they 've been decimated with injuries			2
to say can they go and win the title ? i think they 're too short defensively at this moment in time			1
i do n't think they 're at that level i really do n't			2
' they 're going to have to step it up			0
they look shaky on the ball			0
they lack counter attack , they lack speed , they did n't have anything			0
' they 've got away with murder tonight			2
@entity4 will be happy with the result but they will have to play better than that			1
' i think they will get better , they 're showing a bit of resilience			0
that 's a good quality to have but they need to play better			2
' @entity3 does not believe @entity4 can challenge for the @entity8 title despite the fact they won their fifth consecutive league match against @entity7 @entity4 striker @entity12 helped his side claim all three points by scoring a double @entity19 added : ‘ only three players played well			1
the others were not good			0
normally you have six , seven , eight players who are good			0
but there were too many not good			0
‘ it ’s fantastic now to be third in the table , but i hoped we ’d do that with a better performance because we were the lucky team			0
‘ when you are the better team , you deserve more , but it is the goals which count			0
we have played the first six or seven matches and not won , but we were always the better team			0
’ @entity19 also admitted he was forced to substitute rookie central defender @entity104 in the first half because of a succession of mistakes			1
@entity104 was replaced by @entity4 team - mate @entity108 in the 39th minute the @entity116 coach said : ‘ he had no confidence , he had given three chances away			1
it 's very disappointing for me and for @entity104 , but i had to because as a manager i am responsible			2
it 's tough but it 's also in his best interests			2
‘ i have made a lot of changes and all the boys can survive			0
it is only one match , one moment in a lifetime			2
’ @entity19 also admitted @entity125 , who now has sixth in the @entity8 , was one of the only three players on the pitch who could make a difference			1
he added : ‘ i think that not only the goals are telling us something about @entity125 , but also his performance			0
‘ he was one of the three players on the pitch of @entity4 who were good , or maybe very good			1
he had a great influence on the result			0
’ @entity139 was forced off with a groin injury during @entity4 's encounter against @entity7 @entity125 added : ‘ we did n’t play well but this is our fifth straight win and we are on the way up			1
in the end we nicked it			0
' i felt good and fitness wise it gets better each week			0
if i am fit the goals and assists will come			0
‘ the first goal was a gamble			0
nine out of 10 it does n’t come off but you make your own luck			0
i was a bit lucky because the ball went under the keeper ’s legs			0
‘ next up is @entity16 and although we take it game by game we are happy we are on the up and we have to keep the momentum			1
’ @entity4 have more injury concerns ahead of sunday ’s clash with @entity16 at @entity166 after @entity139 was forced off in the first half with a groin problem			1
