by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 22 july 2013 children born in @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , a fascinating new study has shown			1
top economists at @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity15 analyzed millions of anonymous earnings records to compare income mobility across metropolitan areas - and the results are surprising			1
living in an area with higher average incomes , larger tax credits for the poor or more local colleges does not necessarily improve the chances of someone rising beyond the station of their birth			1
but four broad factors did appear to have an affect , researchers pointed out , and they included the size and dispersion of the local middle class			0
the city where you live : the interesting study found the odds of rising to another income level are notably lower in certain cities , like @entity2 , and much higher in places like @entity13 if all else was equal , @entity45 living in cities with poor families more dispersed among mixed - income neighborhoods are more likely to climb the income ladder			1
children growing up in areas with more two - parent households , better elementary schools and high schools , and more civic engagement , including membership in religious and community groups , were also more able to pull themselves out of poverty and up the income scale			2
' where you grow up matters , ' @entity61 , a @entity17 economist and one of the study ’s authors , told @entity67			0
' there is tremendous variation across the @entity45 in the extent to which kids can rise out of poverty			0
' @entity2 : children born in @entity2 , pictured , are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in other cities where you lived matters less for well - off children than for middle - class and poor children , the researchers found			1
the chances that wealthy children grow up to be wealthy are broadly similar across all cities it appears			0
metropolitan areas with larger black populations had lower upward - mobility rates , but the researchers believed this was not primarily because of their race			2
for example , both white and black residents of @entity2 have low upward mobility , the @entity67 reported			0
interestingly @entity2 and @entity12 have a similar average income , yet the difference between upward mobility rates in the two cities are stark			2
on average , fairly poor children in @entity12 — those who grew up in the 25th percentile of the national income distribution — do as well financially when they grow up as middle - class children — those who grew up at the 50th percentile — from @entity2 , according to @entity107			2
moving up the ladder : the study found children living in parts of @entity112 and the @entity113 were far more likely to climb the income ladder than areas with the same average income in other parts of the country yet , children who moved from a city with poor rates of income mobility to a city with higher mobility rates at a young age were found to do almost as well at climbing the income ladder as kids who lived their whole lives in the latter region			1
if they moved as teenagers , however , they did less well , suggesting the characteristics of different regions rather than something inherent and unchangeable in the residents is responsible			0
the researchers pointed out that their data allowed them to identify only correlations not the causes for the intriguing patterns they discovered .			0

@entity17 and @entity18 , @entity15 researchers analyzed millions of earnings records to compare income mobility across @entity45 cities
children born in @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13
living in areas with higher average incomes , larger tax credits for the poor or more local colleges does not necessarily improve your chances
children in cities where poor families are more dispersed among mixed - income neighborhoods do better and areas with more two - parent homes
