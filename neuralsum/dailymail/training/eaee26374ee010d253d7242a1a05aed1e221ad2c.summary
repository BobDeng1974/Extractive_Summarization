by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 5 august 2012 updated : 05:51 est , 6 august 2012 their embrace lasted no more than a few seconds			1
but a tearful boy of 11 innocently encapsulated the buoyant mood of the nation yesterday after witnessing @entity6 become an @entity8 champion			1
@entity9 raced down through the stands at @entity12 ’s @entity11 to hug the tennis star after what turned out to be one of the best days of each of their separate lives			1
but in that magic moment – captured on giant screens around the court and broadcast to the world – @entity23 ’s feelgood barometer soared after a weekend during which the country , quite simply , went @entity8 daft			1
over here , @entity6 ! @entity9 leans forward to @entity6 asking for a hug happy to oblige : the tennis star ca n't resist the youngster 's demand and holds him in celebration kisses all round : this one 's for girlfriend @entity34 , who cheered him to victory over @entity36 ... and this one 's for the gold medal for @entity6 , it was the moment he turned a dream to reality and sensationally added an @entity8 gold to @entity23 ’s astonishing medal tally			1
for young @entity45 , it was the opportunity of a lifetime to share in the glory of one of his top sporting heroes during a peak of national excitement over the @entity53			1
one minute , he was sitting with his father in the dizzy heights of row @entity56 the next , he broke free to sprint down towards @entity6 and into the players ’ box			1
‘ give me a hug ! ’ he cheekily demanded			1
‘ anything for my fan , ’ said @entity6 , and readily obliged			2
yesterday as he waited for another glimpse of @entity6 and his other tennis hero , @entity36 , he told me : ‘ i was just so happy			2
i had to let him know			2
i ’m his biggest fan and i did n’t want to miss my chance			2
’ his father @entity67 , a 41 - year - old furniture supplier from @entity69 , @entity70 , said : ‘ i was hugging him at the end of the match because he was overwhelmed and crying with joy			1
he said “ get off me ” and slipped out of my arms			2
‘ next thing i know , he ’s all over the telly screens giving @entity6 a hug			2
’ jumping for joy , punching the air in triumph , @entity6 ran back on to the grass to celebrate his prize			2
meanwhile he had made a fan for life			2
@entity9 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , told @entity70 : ' as soon as @entity6 won i was crying with joy and hugging my dad			1
' i told my dad to get off and the next minute i was gone			2
i was down by the royal bit in front of @entity36 ’s mum and dad			2
' then i hugged @entity6			2
i just thought i had to be there			2
' four weeks on from the moment he left @entity11 in tears , the 25 - year - old champion - in - waiting had returned to take his revenge on arch rival @entity36 – and to stride spectacularly into the record books			1
he declared his victory ‘ the biggest win of my life ’ and added : ‘ i ’ll never forget this moment			2
’ winner : @entity6 slumped to his haunches as he contemplates his achievement golden boy : @entity6 's face is etched with unbridled joy as he clinches @entity8 gold against @entity36 the two men share a word after the conclusion of their final @entity113 : @entity6 parades his gold with @entity36 and @entity115 , who beat @entity117 to take bronze @entity6 won @entity23 its first gold medal in the men ’s singles for more than a century , since the 1908 @entity53			1
then he topped it up with silver alongside national sweetheart @entity123 in the mixed doubles			1
so it was n’t hard to understand why the famously grumpy @entity126 managed to raise an ecstatic smile yesterday as he took a well - deserved share in this most glorious weekend in @entity23 sport			1
he even had a stab at mouthing the national anthem – and willingly draped himself in a @entity132 after being presented with his first @entity8 gong			2
his victory was the latest in a succession of triumphs to lift the country ’s spirits in a way that few anticipated before the start of the @entity53			2
for just under two hours yesterday @entity6 was swept along on a wave of @entity23 support that started with a rousing welcome to @entity11 , possibly twice the decibel level of that raised for his @entity147 adversary			1
net gains : @entity6 looks to he heavens after beating @entity36 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 jumping for joy : the celebrations begin for @entity6 if volume alone could have won it for him , he would surely have finished in half that time			1
the cheering was more like @entity154 than @entity12 , and there was no doubt it helped to lift his game			1
‘ come on @entity158 ! ’ someone shouted , causing a ripple of laughter that tickled even the @entity147			0
another called out sarcastically : ‘ we feel quite strongly about you @entity6			0
’ despite the ribaldry , however , few could have doubted they were cheering a future @entity12 champion			1
yesterday @entity6 went in as the underdog and emerged as the victor , and there ’s nothing a @entity23 crowd likes better than that			0
afterwards he immediately paid tribute to the fans , declaring : ‘ the support has been amazing			0
’ from the start of the match it was clear that @entity6 was on a high			0
you did n’t have to know anything about tennis to work that out			0
watching his fist keeping a log of his successes and mistakes was enough			0
he held it at chest level and shook it like @entity192 maracas when he missed a shot ; chin level , like a karaoke microphone , when he was pleased with himself ; and high in the air when he triumphed			0
even if you were n’t well placed to monitor that , there was always the @entity200			0
at the opposite end of the players ’ box from his girlfriend @entity34 , his mother sat motionless during his botched shots , but sprang to her feet to applaud his most spectacular moves			0
ditto @entity123 , who spent much of the match sitting behind mrs @entity210 , showing not a trace of nervousness in the run up to the big moment that would follow			0
@entity23 backing : there was plenty of home support on @entity12 's @entity11 number one fan : @entity34 watched on as @entity6 clinched the @entity8 title at @entity12 shot at the title : @entity6 went in as the underdog and emerged as the victor against the man who beat him four weeks ago at @entity12 comprehensive : @entity6 serves on his way to a resounding victory over @entity36 likewise , @entity6 seemed unusually confident			1
just over 35 minutes into the match , a return bounced tantalisingly on top of the net before tumbling over to his advantage			0
four weeks ago the fist might have been punching the air to celebrate a vital extra point			1
thirty minutes later , @entity235 unfurled a @entity147 flag and draped it over the front of the players ’ box			0
if it was meant to be a talisman it did n’t quite do the trick			0
with @entity6 in this form , @entity36 needed much more than luck on his side			0
out of sight of @entity11 , @entity246 – formerly @entity246 , formally @entity246 – was heaving with spectators			1
some sat gently steaming in the sun that followed a huge downpour			0
how disappointed they must have been to see pictures on the big screen showing small swathes of empty seats			0
by the time the scoreboard began to signal that @entity6 was looking unstoppable , @entity256 broke out in the stands			0
medals at the double : @entity6 shows off his gold medal and the silver he won with partner @entity123 @entity6 and @entity262 were beaten by @entity263 and @entity264 of @entity265 , while @entity266 and @entity267 of the @entity268 took bronze it could never match the cheers of 80,000 in that other stadium behind the clearly defined @entity274 skyline in the distance , but it was like nothing most people have heard at the @entity279 before			1
mr @entity9 paid just £ 260 for tickets for himself , @entity9 and sons @entity282 , nine , and @entity283 , 19			0
‘ i think you could safely say it was worth it , ’ he said			0
speaking later about the hug , @entity6 told me : ‘ i actually thought , because he was in @entity36 ’s box and he asked me for a hug ... i did n’t know quite how to react			0
i thought maybe he was from @entity235 ’s team			0
’ was he pleased to have made a big fan out of a small boy ? ‘ that ’s one of the reasons why the @entity8 is so great , ’ he said			0
‘ everyone gets into them			0
’ @entity6 became the first @entity23 man to win the gold in singles since @entity301 in 1908			0
as well as gold , @entity301 won silver in the men ’s doubles and bronze in the men ’s indoor singles			1
his record stood untouched until shortly after 4pm yesterday			0
but as @entity6 waits over the next 11 months for another crack at the @entity12 title , he would do well not to be over confident			1
@entity301 lost the singles final in 1909			0
but @entity6 has turned his sights towards winning his first grand slam tennis tournament at the @entity315 in three weeks ’ time			1
the 25 - year - old @entity126 said he hopes to be rested enough for success after coming so close at @entity12 last month			1
' i ’ve felt close to @entity318 before , and obviously this is the biggest title of my career , ' he said			0
' i ’ve got the @entity315 in three weeks ’ time , so i ’ll have to get myself rested			1
' i ’m leaving for @entity322 later today , there ’s a tournament starts there			0
i play my first match on wednesday			0
' i ’ve got three weeks to get myself ready for the @entity315 , and i hope that can be the first one			1
' just missed out : @entity6 took a second medal of the day in the mixed doubles with @entity123 , but sadly he had to settle for silver bels of the ball : @entity265 's @entity263 and @entity264 celebrate with their relatives after winning gold in the mixed doubles			1

won 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 on @entity12 's @entity11
@entity336 came exactly four weeks after grand slam defeat to same player
had to settle for silver in the mixed doubles
