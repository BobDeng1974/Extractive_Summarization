by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 07:17 est , 7 november 2012 teachers and coaches at a @entity4 school have been left baffled and furious after a 21 - year - old conned his way back into high school in order to play football			1
@entity10 , 21 , used false documents to attend @entity12 under the alias @entity13 and turned out five times for the @entity17 football team			1

deception : @entity12 in @entity4 , where 21 - year - old @entity10 conned his way onto the school football team with forged documents eager to play football : @entity10 faked a birth certificate and other documents to claim he was 17 and played four games for the @entity17 football team and because he was overage by at least three years in the school 's team , the @entity17 could be forced to forfeit two of their victories			1
the school 's athletic director @entity36 was still trying to work out why @entity10 would con his way back into school just to play football			1
he said : ' he just fit in with all the other high school kids , with the 16 - , 17 - and 18 - year - old kids that belonged there			2
there were really no red flags			2
' anytime you 're duped or lied to , if you will , there 's some frustration that comes with that			0
when it comes to something like this - and integrity issue - that becomes difficult to swallow			0
' @entity10 claimed he was a 17 - year - old senior who was seeking a transfer from a school in @entity56 and had forged documents to this effect			1
top player : @entity10 , who used the alias @entity13 , seen on the ground making a tackle in this @entity17 game no athlete older than 19 is allowed to compete at high school level and when an anonymous parent flagged up their concerns , the school immediately reported the alleged violation to the @entity70			1

' earlier this week we dug up his file , the police became involved and all the school officials , and found documents had been altered and forged , ' @entity36 told @entity87 newspaper			2
' there was a couple days of investigation , looking into that and what we have found is this individual is not the individual that was on the transcript			0
bemused and angry : the @entity74 athletic director @entity36 was shocked to discover @entity10 's real identity ' what we found is he exceeds [ the age requirement ]			1
you ca n't be 19 prior to september 1 to be eligible			0
he was older than 19 on september 1			0
' the student has been removed from @entity102			0
' school superintendent @entity103 said @entity10 had slipped through the cracks : ' well i think we 're kind of the victim of the circumstances			2
' we had all this documentation on file that we would ask for if any student were to come to our district and enroll			0
' we had a birth certificate , we had a transcript , and we had residency information all filed with us , and it was an excellent job of forging			0
' the school is now working with a liaison officer , who is sending the information on to the @entity120 .			0
