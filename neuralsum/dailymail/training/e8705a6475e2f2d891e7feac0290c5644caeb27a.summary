by @entity0 published : 16:07 est , 16 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:18 est , 16 february 2014 many teenagers ' rooms smell like a farmyard , but at least @entity6 has an excuse			0
he is constantly staring at himself in the mirror , goes days without a shower and is noisy in the small hours , because he is a horse			2
the three - year - old castrated @entity12 horse fled inside his owners ' thatched house during a storm in december , and now he does n't want to leave			1
stable home : @entity6 the three - year - old castrated @entity12 horse moved into his owner @entity17 's house in @entity19 , @entity20 , during a hurricane - force storm good neigh - bour : @entity6 comes and goes as he pleases and sometimes he bugs @entity23 for a glass of juice			1
his manners are just dreadful though - he slurps terribly what 's on tv tonight ? @entity6 begs to be let into the living room , left , and once he is inside he completely dominates it - to which ms @entity17 ( pictured ) ca n't help but laugh his owner @entity17 , from the village of @entity19 in northern @entity20 , told @entity34 the horse likes to play the keyboard and drink juice			1
he took refuge indoors when much of northern @entity39 including @entity40 was battered by the hurricane - strength storm @entity42 in december , whose fatalities included a lorry driver in @entity45 and a man crushed by a tree near @entity48			2
so far he has been neater and tidier than many teenagers			0
he helps his owner sort out her firewood and the biggest damage he has caused has been a smashed cup , which earned him a stern talking - to			1
ms @entity17 , a 39 - year - old doctor , said : ' he does n't like rain and wind ... he thought it was very appropriate			1
sometimes he stands before the mirror and bobs his head			2
' trotting out his favourite tunes : @entity6 's hobbies include playing the keyboard with his face and looking at his long straight hair in the mirror			0
like any teenager , then why the long face ? like so many teenagers , @entity6 is obsessed with looking at his own reflection			0
unlike most teenagers , his hair has already gone grey home sweet home : owner @entity17 defended herself for allowing @entity6 into her home , saying : ' i do not think he 's in the house against his will ' @entity6 usually sleeps outside like a normal horse , preferring to roam indoors during the day , but that does not stop him and ms @entity17 taking the occasional nap			1
at the age of three , he is the equine equivalent of a human teenager as he is almost at full maturity			0
so should n't he be roaming free in the fields , his owner was asked			0
ms @entity17 replied he had ' never cared seriously ' for his paddock and stable			2
she added : ' i do not think he 's in the house against his will			0
' does my bum look big in this ? as with any stroppy teenager , it is probably not a good idea to startle @entity6 from behind			0
he might not take too kindly to it what are you up to ? @entity6 has taken a liking to ms @entity17 's straw filing boxes , possibly because they remind him of the sleeping material inside his stable time to hit the hay ? despite being enormous , @entity6 feels comfortable in the little thatched house and is known to take the odd nap with his owner mine ! so far @entity6 has caused almost no damage			1
his owner said the worst so far was a smashed cup - which earned him a very stern talking to			1
he has n't done it again			0

three - year - old @entity12 horse fled inside his owners ' thatched house in @entity19 , @entity20 , in december in a storm
since then he has made himself at home , staring at himself in the mirror and coming and going as he pleases
@entity17 said he ' never cared seriously ' for his paddock and the only damage has been a smashed cup
