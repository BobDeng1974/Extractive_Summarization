by @entity0 and @entity1 for the @entity2 and @entity3 for the @entity2 it first , it had looked like a simple case of crookery among the cooks			0
viewers of this week ’s @entity10 saw one contestant ’s ice cream pudding reduced to slush in an apparent act of sabotage by bespectacled grandmother @entity15 , causing her rival to storm off and also be eliminated from the competition			1
but yesterday the mystery of the @entity19 took a tasty new twist – and this time it was the @entity21 which was feeling the heat			2
stroll down for video upset : @entity15 , 69 , pictured at her home in @entity25 , says she has been unfairly blamed for a rival 's failed @entity26 on last night 's show - it later emerged that she never returned to the show wednesday night 's show descended into chaos when bearded competitor @entity33 binned his pudding after the ice cream melted in the @entity37 heat and stormed out of the tent @entity39 - who at 69 is the show 's oldest ever contestant - was clearly seen removing his pudding from the freezer despite being warned by another that it belonged to him - but mrs @entity15 said today she was the victim of a ' stitch up ' meltdown : this is the moment @entity33 decided he had to bin his @entity26 after it collapsed @entity47 - haired mrs @entity15 , 69 , wept as she claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain , deliberately editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of the freezer for several minutes			1
adding to the pressure - cooker atmosphere , last night it emerged that she will take no further part in the show			1
this , however , is because of illness rather than ‘ @entity59 ’ , after she lost her sense of smell following a fall			0
the scandal is the biggest to hit @entity63 off since last year ’s @entity65 drama , when one contestant tearfully admitted taking another ’s custard to use in a trifle			0
getting to the soggy bottom of the baked @entity71 incident , however , was proving rather more difficult last night			0
the story starts on wednesday when 8million viewers watched bearded @entity33 , 31 , throw a wobbly when he found his dessert had been reduced to a splodge after mrs @entity15 took it out of the freezer			1
@entity15 says the knives have been out for her and she sobbed after watching the show last night mr @entity33 , 31 , screamed in frustration and was knocked out of the competition after he walked up to judges @entity81 and @entity83 with a bin in his hand instead of a pudding he was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges @entity81 and @entity83 , then stormed off set			1
that led to mrs @entity15 , from @entity25 , being pilloried as a cheat in cruel online comments			1
there were more than 550 complaints to the @entity21			2
what happened to @entity33 's baked @entity71 and is the @entity21 to blame for its destruction ? she , however , insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes , rather than seconds			1
‘ they deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment , ’ she said			0
‘ the @entity21 should be ashamed			2
‘ the cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and i was asking who it belonged to			0
then @entity33 walked over and took it away			2
it happened as simply as that			0
‘ @entity33 did n’t blame me at all			2
i was very disappointed and upset by how they cleverly edited the show and as a result i have people saying all sorts of nasty things about me			0
’ others pointed out that wednesday ’s episode had been filmed in a tent in the may heatwave			0
fellow competitor @entity123 , 33 , said some freezers had not worked properly in the heat and added : ‘ poor @entity15 is a scapegoat for @entity21			1
’ judge @entity81 , 79 , said his behaviour was ' unacceptable ' and refused to put him through to the next round the @entity130 construction engineer won the sympathy of many who felt he had been the victim of an underhand plot by his rivals how the @entity2 reported on wednesday 's scandal even mr @entity33 said : ‘ i do n’t hold @entity15 responsible in any way			1
there are no grudges , we are still friends and keep in contact regularly			0
’ however , he disputed the claim that the dessert was out of the freezer for only 40 seconds or so , saying it must have been longer because otherwise it would not have melted so much			0
a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ @entity15 removing @entity33 ’s ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for @entity33 ’s departure			1
’ mrs @entity15 ’s own withdrawal from the @entity152 series comes after she fainted and banged her head before production of the next episode			1
she damaged her olfactory nerve , meaning , she said : ‘ i have now lost my sense of smell and most of my taste			0

@entity15 says ' knives are out ' for her and she cried after seeing show
rival @entity33 stormed off set when his @entity26 collapsed
mrs @entity15 seen taking it from fridge - but she says it was back in in seconds
' i *'ve* been stitched up . why would i want to sabotage @entity33 's @entity26 ? '
it emerged today that she never returned to the bake off after episode
@entity21 : ' @entity15 will not appear in the rest of the series as she fell ill '
