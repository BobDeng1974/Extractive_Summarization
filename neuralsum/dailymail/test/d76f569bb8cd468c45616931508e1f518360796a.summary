the producers of the tv show made in @entity2 pride themselves on featuring some of the poshest young ladies and gentleman in @entity5			1
but even by their standards , @entity7 - @entity6 is well - to - do - the privately educated son of a multimillionaire industrialist and model would n't have to work a day in his life if he chose not to			1
but if you were n't already envious of the reality star , he has now opened up his watch collection to the @entity17 , showing off some of the 16 eye - wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens			1
many watch enthusiasts would argue that @entity22 has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds			0
in a new interview with the newspaper , he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them			0
the include a @entity37 42 , a @entity38 and a @entity40 yellow gold @entity41			1
@entity22 's most expensive watch is a @entity38 white gold @entity43 , which he bought from a shop on @entity46 in @entity2 earlier this year			1
@entity22 's most expensive watch is a @entity38 white gold @entity43 ( left ) , while one of his flashiest is a @entity37 42 ( right ) it cost £ 32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day			1
one of the flashiest watches in his collection is the @entity37 42 , which he purchased on holiday in @entity61 and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £ 6,5000			2
he said of the item : ' when i was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the @entity37 , which the @entity37 family had given her in the 1950s - i think it 's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel			2
' @entity22 ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother 's version while out rowing at school			0
@entity78 favours a @entity38 timepiece because it is no longer made ( left ) , while he wears a @entity40 yellow gold @entity81 when out raving in @entity5 ( right ) while many of his watches are hard to come by , @entity78 favours a @entity38 timepiece in particular because it is no longer made , meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man			1
similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £ 9,000			0
he told the newspaper : ' @entity38 does n't make this one any more , which i love			2
i did see someone else wearing it once , however - i was at the @entity94 and it was this fat @entity95 , i was mortified			0
' and finally , for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting @entity5 ... a @entity40 yellow gold @entity81			2
similar watches can be bought on the internet for £ 8,000			0
he said : ' you can swim in it , sleep in it , throw it around , go to a rave			0
this is my hardwearing , " i 'm going to @entity110 " watch			0
