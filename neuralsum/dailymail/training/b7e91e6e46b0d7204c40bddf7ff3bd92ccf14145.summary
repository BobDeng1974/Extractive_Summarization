by @entity0 published : 15:03 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:24 est , 24 february 2014 the gap between the wealthy and the poor is most extreme in several of the @entity6 ' most prosperous and largest cities			1
the economic divides in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are significantly greater than the national average , according to a study released last week by the @entity16 , the @entity10 - based think tank			1
it suggests that many sources of both economic growth and income inequality have co-existed near each other for the past 35 years			2
these cities may struggle in the future to provide adequate public schooling , basic municipal services because of a narrow tax base and ' may fail to produce housing and neighborhoods accessible to middle - class workers and families , ' the study said			2
this @entity16 maps shows the economic inequality in large cities , with dark green circles ( like @entity8 and @entity9 ) representing more wealthy disparity explained : in @entity8 , the average income for the top 5percent of residents is nearly 20 times of that of the income for the bottom 20 percent of residents			1
' there 's something of a relationship between economic success and inequality , ' said @entity49 , a senior fellow at @entity16			0
' these cities are home to some of the highest paying industries and jobs in the country			2
' at the same time , @entity49 noted , many of these cities may inadvertently widen the gap between rich and poor because they have public housing and basic services that make them attractive to low - wage workers			1
the findings come at a delicate moment for the country , still slogging through a weak recovery from the @entity66			0
much of the nation 's job growth has been concentrated in lower - wage careers			0
few @entity6 have enjoyed pay raises			0
president @entity71 is pushing for a higher minimum wage			0
protesters in @entity9 have tried to block a private bus that shuttles @entity76 employees from gentrifying neighborhoods to their offices in @entity79			0
many wealthy @entity6 , from venture capitalist @entity80 to real estate billionaire @entity81 , argue that the nation has tipped toward class warfare			0
incomes for the top 5 percent of earners in @entity8 averaged $ 279,827 in 2012			1
that 's almost 19 times more than what the bottom 20 percent of that city 's population earned			1
unequal and rising : the gap between rich and poor has also grown the most in @entity9 , @entity8 and @entity92 since the @entity66 as poor families get even poorer			1
meanwhile , the gap has actually shrunk in @entity95 and @entity96 this ratio is more than double the nationwide average for this measure of income inequality			1
the top 5 percent of earners across the country have incomes 9.1 times greater than the bottom quintile			1
major chasms also appeared in the tech hub of @entity9 , the financial center of @entity11 , the seat of the federal government in @entity10 and the home of the entertainment industry in @entity13			1
' in @entity9 , skyrocketing housing costs may increasingly preclude low - income residents from living in the city altogether , ' the study said			1
@entity9 mayor @entity116 said in an editorial published last week that ' working families can not support themselves on the ( city 's ) current minimum wage of $ 10.74 per hour ' - already $ 3.49 above the federal minimum and 64 cents more than @entity71 's proposed increase			1
@entity116 has also announced plans to build and restore 10,000 homes for low and moderate - income families by 2020			2
not all tech hubs have witnessed rising inequality			0
winning issue : @entity129 was catapulted into @entity130 in part with his ' tale of two cities ' campaigning over the city 's wealth gap @entity95 , where @entity137 and @entity138 are based , saw its income disparity decline since 2007			1
@entity140 , @entity141 , experienced a mild uptick			0
' both the tech boom and energy boom are inequality - reducing , ' said @entity145 , chief economic strategist at the @entity146 in @entity10			0
' @entity147 introduces a path to good jobs			0
' the @entity16 study also found that inequality increased across cities even though incomes often fell for wealthy households between the start of the recession in 2007 and 2012			2
during that five - year period , average incomes for the top 5 percent in @entity158 , @entity159 , tumbled $ 18,999 to $ 152,329			1
but the bottom 20 percent living in @entity158 lost a greater share of their incomes over that period , so the level of inequality increased			2
significant gaps also exist in @entity92 and @entity166			0
but that 's largely because their poorest residents there earn so little			2
the lowest quintile of @entity92 residents earned just $ 10,348 in 2012 , about half the national average for that group			1
of the nation 's 50 biggest cities , just 18 experienced greater income inequality since the recession that was statistically significant			2
that was due primarily to falling incomes for the poorest residents			0
this occurred in places that suffered from the burst of the housing bubble - such as @entity186 , @entity187 , and @entity188 , @entity189 - and @entity191 cities still reeling from the collapse of manufacturing such as @entity193 , @entity194 ; @entity195 , @entity196 ; and @entity197 , @entity198			0
not all the 50 largest cities are bastions of inequality			0
some @entity203 and @entity204 cities with smaller downtowns had a noticeably smaller divide than the national average			1
these cities such as @entity210 , @entity187 , and @entity211 , @entity141 , are essentially ' overgrown suburbs , ' the study said			0
they tend to attract neither the highest - paying jobs nor the extreme poverty of the older cities .			0

in @entity8 , @entity218 , average income for the top 5percent of wealthiest residents ( $ *280,000* ) in nearly 20 times that of the bottom **20percent** ( less than $ *15,000* )
@entity11 ranks sixth in income disparity with the wealthiest residents making 13 times as much as the bottom **20percent**
the income gap has become a *hot* button issue in both national and local politics
@entity11 mayor @entity129 made it a central part of his campaign with the ' tale of two cities '
