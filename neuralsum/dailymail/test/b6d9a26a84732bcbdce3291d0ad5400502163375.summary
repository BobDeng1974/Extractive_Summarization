@entity0 saw his lead pegged back to 4 - 2 after losing that frame — and tried to hand his footwear to a fan			1
he also asked : ‘ does anyone in here have some size eight or nine shoes i can borrow			1
i ’m serious ? ’ but tournament director @entity41 summoned him out of the arena and lent him his own shoes for the last three frames of the session			2
the @entity48 dress code reads : ‘ each member shall ensure that their dress and appearance is smart and appropriate for a professional player			2
’ @entity0 was given dispensation to wear casual shoes last year at the @entity56 after breaking his ankle			1

@entity48 chairman @entity67 said : ‘ the one thing you can be sure of with @entity0 is that you have absolutely no idea what he is going to do next			2
‘ i would rather he played with his shoes on if it all possible though			2
and what happens if his trousers are a bit tight in the next session of his match ? ’ meanwhile , @entity79 blew the chance to win £ 30,000 and become only the seventh player to make a maximum at the @entity2			1
he incredibly played for the blue after the 13th red following 12 blacks and only gasps from the crowd alerted him to the blunder			0
@entity79 looked stunned before a doomed long - distance attempt on the black failed			1
however , he shrugged off the setback to claim a 10 - 7 victory			0
@entity79 , who now plays @entity92 in the second round , said : ‘ i was concentrating so hard i forgot			2
i had been 4 - 0 behind and doing everything to get back into the match , and already thinking about trying to win the next frame			2
‘ i only realised what i had done after playing for the blue because the crowd reacted			0
then i checked the scoreboard			0
@entity101 one day i will get another chance to make a 147 at the @entity2 , but it was a bit embarrassing			0
’ @entity105 , a two - time @entity2 finalist , looked in good touch in his first match at the venue since being given the all - clear from lung cancer			0

the 29 - year - old from @entity134 , who now plays @entity136 , said : ‘ that does n’t happen very often at this level			1
but that was my c game			0
@entity132 gave the chances rather than me earning them			0
i will need to play a lot better to be in the mix for the title			0

@entity0 had to borrow pair of shoes from audience member
the 39 - year - old played one frame in socks due to ankle discomfort
@entity0 was breaking snooker *etiquette* in failing to wear smart shoes
