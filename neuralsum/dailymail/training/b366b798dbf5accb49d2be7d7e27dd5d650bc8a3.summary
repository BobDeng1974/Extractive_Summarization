the multi-millionaire owner of retail business @entity85 told a conference of @entity88 in @entity89 : ‘ i have heard rumours that there is a majority in the @entity93 who are in favour of having a referendum			0

' i 'm sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose @entity4 votes in what is going to be a very tight election			0

' what was agreed then [ in 1975 ] was that each side of the @entity4 could make speeches and campaign for what they thought was right			0

a referendum at some time in the next @entity178 '			0
