click here to see all of the stats from @entity2 's with our brilliant @entity3 there will not be posters commemorating this victory in the match - day programme next week and the travelling fans are unlikely to have their ticket prices refunded			1
but this victory over a solid @entity13 side was every bit as important as last week ’s 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity16			1
it lifts @entity18 to an unlikely second in the table after nine games , two points clear of reigning champions @entity23			1
it also extends the best defensive record in all four tiers of @entity28 football , with just five goals conceded and only one of those at @entity2 ’s			1
@entity32 ( c ) celebrates after scoring the winner in @entity18 's 1 - 0 defeat of @entity13 @entity18 teammates congratulate @entity32 as the @entity18 move up to second place in the table @entity18 manager @entity39 ( @entity40 ) high - fives @entity32 for repaying his faith in bringing him back into the side @entity18 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) @entity43 6 ; @entity44 7 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 6 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 ( @entity51 62 6 ) , @entity32 8 , @entity52 8 ; @entity53 7 subs : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 @entity39 : 7 @entity13 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity61 6 ; @entity62 5 , @entity63 5 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 ; @entity68 6 , @entity69 5 ( @entity70 52 6 ) , moses 7 ( @entity71 78 ) ; @entity72 6 subs : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , , @entity74 , @entity71 , @entity78 @entity79 : 6 referee : @entity81 @entity82 man : @entity52 player ratings from @entity84 at @entity2 's ‘ this win was more difficult than last week and maybe even nicer , ’ said manager @entity39			1
‘ it will be nice to enjoy the table on sunday and it ’s good for the fans to see but on monday we go back to work			2
the clean sheet is very important			0
’ not many would have predicted such smooth sailing on the south coast after the mass exodus of players in the summer			0
but @entity53 , @entity52 and @entity46 have proved rich assets in the absence of @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
‘ we deserved the win , ’ said @entity39			0
‘ the lads showed great ambition and in the first half we were even better than last week			2
maybe people are not surprised any more about our qualities			0
’ since joining @entity18 after the departure of @entity112 , it seems @entity39 can do no wrong			1
the one change he made after that decimation of @entity16 was bringing @entity32 into the starting line up			2
the @entity118 midfielder repaid the favour , tormenting @entity62 down the left flank before putting the @entity18 ahead on 33 minutes			2
@entity32 , 22 , had his first @entity122 goal scored against @entity16 last week harshly taken from him by the dubious goals panel			1
there can be no doubt about this one			0
he leapt onto the rebound after @entity53 ’s shot ricocheted off the post and fired powerfully past @entity61			0
@entity18 recaptured the invention and vigour of last saturday ’s historic victory and within 10 minutes had recorded five shots on target			2
@entity53 and @entity52 , who played against each other in the @entity137 league last season , linked up as if they have been team - mates for years and @entity32 fitted in seamlessly			1
bought from @entity140 for £ 11.8million , he collected the ball from outside the box in the third minute and curled in a useful cross which @entity53 strained for but could not reach			0
a @entity18 supporter sits on the ground outside of @entity2 's ahead of the game @entity13 manager and former @entity18 player @entity79 ( r ) greets his counterpart @entity39 before kick off in form striker @entity53 had the first close - cut chance for @entity18 in the first half the @entity153 reacts after missing an opportunity to put @entity18 into the lead after 17 minutes @entity32 returned to the side to give @entity18 a first half lead with a close range finish after @entity53 had hit the post mane wheels away with a beaming smile after seeing his strike earn @entity18 a 1 - 0 lead @entity18 's match winning goal came from a set piece where @entity53 hit the post before @entity32 finished @entity168 miles @entity18 111.2 69.1 @entity49 90 11.6 7.2 @entity52 90 11.5 7.1 @entity169 90 11.1 6.9 @entity13 109.2 67.9 @entity66 90 11.2 7.0 @entity170 90 11.2 6.9 @entity72 90 11.1 6.9 @entity13 squandered chances in the opening stages			1
@entity72 headed wide from a promising @entity174 cross			0
then the talented @entity175 made a mazy run into the box but could not muster an end product , his weak attempt easily saved by @entity43			0
@entity63 was also unfortunate to be booked by referee @entity81 for changing his boots on the pitch			0
@entity13 substitute @entity184 had their best chance to level proceedings when supplied with a brilliant cross by @entity62 , however , his right - footed shot from very close range missed to the left of the target			1
‘ if he makes contact then possibly we could have taken something out of the game , ’ said @entity13 manager @entity79 , ' from our point of view , we 're a little bit disappointed with the first half , really			1
' we did n't really ask enough questions of @entity18 , made it a little bit too easy , showed them a little too much respect , i would suggest , which is understandable to a certain extent given their exploits last time out here			2
' i think that was the case in the first half			2
they caused us a few problems at set plays and obviously from one of the ones we did n't deal with it dropped handily for them and they 've been able to dispatch the winning goal			0
' second half , i thought we were a lot better			0
we made a change very early on , got @entity184 on , and that gave us a threat in behind and that stretched the game			0
' it allowed us to control of the game and in the second half i thought we were the better side , but we never really created those clear - cut chances we need to get back on level terms			1
' @entity13 keeper @entity61 can only watch as the ball bounces into the back of the net in form striker @entity53 can not hide his delight after setting up @entity32 for the opening goal @entity232 defender @entity44 ( @entity40 ) rushes to congratulate @entity32 in the sunshine on the south coast @entity13 striker @entity72 argues with a linesman as the visitors push for an equaliser @entity69 ( @entity40 ) lunges in for a tackle on @entity18 playmaker @entity52 @entity52 made the right side of the pitch his own - click here for more stats from our @entity3 @entity18 creator @entity52 had another influential game that saw him control the right flank @entity79 cajoles his players from the sidelines as @entity13 come out fighting in the second half @entity53 ( c ) tries to force his way between @entity13 defenders @entity63 ( r ) and @entity64 @entity252 target @entity49 tries to steal the ball from @entity13 's @entity66 ( r ) @entity79 protested for a penalty without success after @entity44 appeared to bring down @entity184 late in the game			1

@entity18 defeated @entity13 1 - 0 in their @entity122 clash at @entity2 's
@entity32 returned to the side to open the scoring from a set piece situation in the first half
the result takes @entity18 above @entity23 to second place in the table
