' the ayatollahs in @entity18 will watch whether we put on real sanctions ' against @entity15 interests , she warned in a lunchtime speech at the @entity23			1
' they will look at what we do , ' @entity5 said , ' and we should worry if we do not act			0
' ' i 'm afraid that the @entity8 administration 's weakness will put us in a position where we 'll talk and talk , and @entity18 will march forward toward a nuclear weapon			2
' @entity1 sen. @entity5 , @entity32 talks with reporters after speaking at the @entity23 on friday , march 14 , 2014 in @entity2 , @entity3 @entity3 @entity34 sen. @entity5 gives a scathing speech at the @entity23 @entity18 's supreme leader @entity36			1
@entity5 said the @entity37 in @entity18 will watch whether @entity1 implement ' real sanctions ' @entity5 is part of a young group of @entity34 hard - chargers who are pushing harder than usual this year for a @entity34 landslide in november , hoping to flip at least six @entity45 seats and seize the majority			1
' it 's no fun being in the minority party , living under @entity50 's rules , ' she jabbed at the @entity45 ' majority leader			0
@entity50 , she said , has morphed the @entity52 from ' the world 's greatest deliberative body ' to a ' my way or the highway ' institution			0
' it matters so much for our country that we win this november , ' she told a packed hotel ballroom in @entity2 , @entity3 ' right now we 're in a position where our allies feel abandoned ... and our enemies feel emboldened			0
' the @entity8 administration has shied away from referring to any nation as @entity1 's ' enemy , ' including @entity18 and @entity15			1
but @entity5 , along with other @entity69 including @entity71 @entity70 and @entity73 @entity72 , have n't been as reticent			0
a successful @entity1 foreign policy , @entity5 said friday , would mean @entity1 's ' enemies understand that you do n't mess with the @entity1			1
' ' unfortunately i do n't think that 's the message they 're getting right now , and it 's making us less safe , ' she said			0
she joined former @entity84 gov. @entity83 in saying that @entity85 , the @entity34 ' unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate , had a most clear - headed outlook on @entity15 than president @entity8			2
@entity45 mocked @entity85 during the campaign when he referred to @entity15 as @entity1 's top geopolitical foe			1
' let 's face it ladies and gentlemen : @entity85 was right , ' said @entity5 , who was once on @entity85 's short list to be his vice presidential running mate			2
laughable : sen. @entity5 took particular aim at @entity97 and the ' reset ' button she infamously gave @entity15 foreign minister @entity99 in 2009 the gimmick was supposed to symbolize the intention to ' reset ' relations between the @entity1 and @entity15 oops : instead of reading ' perezagruzka ' - the @entity15 word for ' reset ' - a stick - on label used the word ' peregruzka ' was used , which actually meant ' overcharged ' she reserved special scorn for @entity97 , the former first lady , @entity1 senator and secretary of state who figured to be the @entity45 's chosen successor to @entity8			1
' to this day , no one has been held accountable ' for the 2012 terror attack in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity5 said			0
and riffing on @entity117 's one - time claim that it made little difference whether the attack was a premeditated terror strike or a protest that spun out of control , she declared : ' i want to say to @entity97 that this does matter			0
' @entity5 also jabbed @entity117 for her 2009 appearance with @entity15 foreign minister @entity99 in @entity127 , where she famously presented her counterpart with a ' reset button			1
' ' we want to reset our relationship , and so we will do it together , ' she said then			0
the prop , meant to signify a new era in @entity1 - @entity15 relations , now seems wishful to some in @entity137 , including @entity5			2
and the message itself was misspelled			0
instead of reading ' perezagruzka , ' the @entity15 word for ' reset , ' a stick - on label used the word ' peregruzka , ' which means ' overcharged			0
' ' lest anyone forget , it was @entity117 who pushed reset button with @entity15 , ' @entity5 said friday			1
' i 'm looking forward to seeing that in campaign commercials			2

' the @entity37 in @entity18 will watch whether we put on real sanctions ' against @entity15 , warns @entity3 @entity34 senator @entity5
she *slammed* @entity97 's famous ' reset button ' moment in @entity127
' i 'm looking forward to seeing that in campaign commercials , ' she said
@entity5 became the second politician friday *morning* to say that ' @entity85 *[* @entity85 *]* was right ' about @entity15 being @entity1 's biggest geopolitical foe
