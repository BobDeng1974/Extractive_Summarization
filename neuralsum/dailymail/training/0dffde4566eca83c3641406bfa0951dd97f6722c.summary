@entity3 is prepared to move the @entity5 semi-finals and final to june in 2022 to accommodate a winter @entity6 in @entity7 , the @entity2 body 's president @entity0 has revealed			1
@entity0 said a solution to deciding the dates of the tournament was now ' not so far ' and that it would not be a problem to move the @entity5 - something that could prove to be an important compromise			2
a @entity15 task force to decide on the dates met on monday and afterwards @entity15 secretary general @entity17 said it had identified november / december 2022 and january / february 2022 as the most likely options in order to avoid the fierce heat of june and july			1
a final decision is expected in march			1
@entity3 president @entity0 ( left ) says the 2022 @entity5 semi-finals and final could be moved @entity0 ( centre ) said the tournament 's latter stages could be in june because of the @entity7 winter @entity6 @entity7 was awarded the @entity27 in 2010 , despite fears of the country 's hot climate affecting players the @entity32 , pictured here in its artistic form , is one of 12 proposed stadia for the @entity27 the 45,330 capacity stadium could have games staged in novemeber / december 2022 if @entity15 get their way @entity40 won this summer 's @entity6 thanks to @entity42 's ( second left ) strike after extra time @entity0 , speaking on his first visit to @entity46 , @entity48 's national football centre in @entity49 , said : ' as the president of the confederation i have no problem ... because it is not a problem for the competition of the @entity5 , we can move the dates in 2022 and have two semi-finals and the final in june , so that is not a problem			1
' @entity0 had previously been insistent that the @entity27 should be played in january rather than november - and said that was because november could affect up to six international calendar dates in that month , october and september beforehand			1
he added : ' everybody speaks about the clubs and the leagues but if it is in november and december then you lose six dates of the national teams			2
but we are not so far away with @entity15			2
we are not so far from a good solution			2
' @entity0 ( left ) was speaking at @entity46 where he was given a tour by @entity74 chairman @entity73 ( right ) playing in january 2022 would cause severe friction with the @entity76 over the timing of its winter olympics - and @entity15 president @entity80 has guaranteed it would not do so			1
asked about that issue , @entity0 said : ' that is @entity15 , they do n't want to clash with the @entity76 but the rest of the world wants to find the best solution for the football			1
' in a wide - ranging interview , @entity0 said he understood why @entity91 's @entity90 striker @entity89 , banned for four months for biting an opponent during the @entity6 , had not been nominated for the @entity93 because player behaviour is one of the components of the award			1
he said : ' if the @entity93 is on the quality of the player then naturally he deserves to be on the list			2
but if you consider the player 's behaviour then that creates a little problem			2
this is a guy who was suspended for four months by @entity15			0
if the @entity93 is a question of behaviour then i agree that he should not be on the list			0
' @entity89 ( left ) was banned for four months after biting @entity113 during this summer 's @entity6 @entity113 shows the bite marks on his shoulder caused by @entity89 during their @entity117 clash the @entity3 president also admitted he had been surprised to read reports that the @entity121 's former @entity15 member @entity120 had agreed to be bugged by the @entity122 for meetings with football officials during the @entity125			1
the @entity126 reported that @entity120 agreed to take a bug hidden inside a key ring into meetings , some of which took place in @entity133			0
he was under investigation by the @entity122 and tax authorities for millions in unpaid taxes , the newspaper said			0
@entity0 said : ' that was a big surprise			0
i know @entity120 , he 's a good friend of mine and the last time i went to @entity142 i went to see him in the hospital because he has a small cancer			0
some @entity121 reports suggest former @entity121 @entity15 member @entity120 had agreed to be bugged by the @entity122 for meetings with football officials during the @entity125 after being under investigation ' i was very surprised when i read that in the newspaper			1
' i read it was in @entity133 but i was not there and we never speak about that			0
' @entity0 also described @entity46 as a ' beautiful ' facility that would help @entity48 develop better players			0
he added : ' but it 's not just about having this place - you have to have the coaches and the people who can create good players			0
if you have good players in @entity48 then the clubs will not go abroad to bring in players			0
