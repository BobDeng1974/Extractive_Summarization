by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 11:30 est , 3 january 2014 the intricate and winding landscape of the world ’s tallest mountain has been captured from space			2
@entity7 ’s snow - covered peaks are seen in stark contrast against the brown and barren landscape in this @entity12 satellite image			1
it is one of 14 mountain peaks on @entity16 that stand taller than 26,000ft ( 8,000m ) and the local @entity18 name for it is @entity20 , which means ' mother of the universe			1
' this clear aerial view of @entity7 's peak was captured last month as @entity12 's @entity12 satellite orbited over @entity18			1
it is one of 14 mountain peaks on @entity16 that stand taller than 26,000ft and the local @entity18 name for it is @entity20 , which means ' mother of the universe ' @entity7 : 29,035ft ( 8,850m ) @entity33 : 28,253ft ( 8,612m ) @entity34 : 28,169ft ( 8,586m ) @entity35 : 27,890ft ( 8,501m ) @entity36 : 27,765ft ( 8,462 m ) @entity37 : 26,906ft ( 8,201 m ) @entity38 : 26,794ft ( 8,167m ) @entity39 : 26,758ft ( 8,156m ) @entity40 : 26,658ft ( 8,125m ) @entity41 : 26,545ft ( 8,091m ) @entity42 : 26,470ft ( 8,068m ) @entity43 : 26,400ft ( 8,047m ) @entity44 : 26,360ft ( 8,035m ) @entity45 : 26,289ft ( 8,013m ) @entity7 is the tallest of these so - called ‘ eight - thousanders ’ and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared			1
all 14 of them are found in @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity18			2
@entity7 ’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the @entity55 subcontinent began a slow - motion collision with @entity57			1
the edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the @entity61 today			0
glaciers have chiselled @entity7 ’s summit into a huge , triangular pyramid , defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast , southeast , and northwest			2
the southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route			0
it is the one @entity71 and @entity72 followed in may 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely			0
@entity7 , pictured , was formed 40 million years ago when the @entity55 subcontinent collided with @entity57			0
the edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the @entity61 today			0
glaciers have chiselled @entity7 's summit into a huge , triangular pyramid despite its reputation as an extremely dangerous mountain , commercial guiding has done much to improve the safety of the @entity7 ascent			0
as of march 2012 , there had been 5,656 successful ascents of @entity7 , although 223 people had died at fatality rate of 4 per cent			0
the satellite image was taken in december , just weeks after @entity12 captured the rivers of black lava snaking over the snow - covered slopes of the stratovolcano @entity94 in @entity95 .			1

@entity12 ’s @entity12 satellite captured the shot above @entity18
@entity7 ’s snow - covered peaks contrast against the brown barren ridges
the mountain is one of 14 peaks that stand taller than 26,000ft ( 8,000m )
the @entity18 name for it is @entity20 , or ' mother of the universe '
