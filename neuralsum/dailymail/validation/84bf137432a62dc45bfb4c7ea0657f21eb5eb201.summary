a @entity1 fan on @entity2 - @ @entity3 – tweeted recently : ' i dread the day @entity5 retires more than i dread my own death			1
' at first it makes shocking reading , but when you factor in the extreme passion of football fans , the love they have for their club , and the astonishingly high regard @entity1 fans have for their captain , it all makes sense			1
it should be interpreted in the same way as @entity22 ’s famous quote : ' football is not a matter of life and death , it ’s more important that that			2
' here ’s another way of saying it			2
@entity1 will not be able to replace @entity5 when he finally retires			1
@entity30 have had to move on already			0
but the question remains , how on earth will @entity1 cope when the inevitable happens ? life and @entity1 will go on of course , but reflecting on yet another incredible man - of - the - match performance from @entity5 at @entity36 , it occurred to me that he is unique			1
@entity5 and @entity38 celebrate on the @entity36 pitch after @entity1 's win on sunday not so long ago some were declaring @entity5 was finished			1
he could n’t train properly , we were told			0
he could n’t play two games in a week apparently			0
the truth is very different			0
@entity45 ' ridiculous high line ensured this over-hyped manager got the worst from @entity5 and made the player look vulnerable			1
and then @entity48 arrived to seemingly finish off the destruction of arguably @entity1 ’s greatest ever player			1
@entity38 has resurrected the @entity51			0
it is now a major cause for concern among @entity1 fans if @entity5 is n’t in the starting line - up			1
so in playing terms , he is still the first name on the team sheet , even with the likes of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 at the club			2
but the love for @entity5 among @entity1 fans is about so much more than him being a very good centre half			1
and that ’s why he is seemingly irreplaceable			0
@entity5 beat @entity69 to score @entity1 's crucial first goal in the @entity72 final the @entity74 captain ran off to celebrate after breaking the deadlock at @entity36 ... and he led the celebrations at the end as the @entity1 players partied after winning the @entity72 he came through the youth ranks , and is now a revered @entity1 captain			1
his team - mates respect him , and they listen to him			0
the fans still idolise him			0
the football world laughed when he lifted the @entity85 trophy with his full kit on despite being suspended for that final			0
but most if not all @entity1 fans understood it			2
@entity5 was a huge part of that journey , and in their minds he belonged on that podium , he deserved the champagne , and he deserved to be wearing the shirt that night as the celebrations began			1
the cynics and critics will go on and on about @entity5 ’s indiscretions – some alleged , some not			2
he ’s far from perfect of course , a bit like the rest of us			0
and i would n’t say @entity1 fans do n’t care about any of that stuff			2
but it does n’t hide the fact that when he does decide to retire , there will be a massive @entity107 to fill			0
the @entity1 captain celebrates after they beat @entity110 to win the @entity85 in 2012 i ’m not a @entity1 fan , so i asked three friends of mine who are to sum it up			1
a work colleague , @entity115 , said this : ' he is our rock , our leader , without him we do n’t win all those titles and we love him for how much he gives his all to the shirt			0
you can imagine cutting him and his blood would spill out blue			0
every other fan hates him but knows deep down they would love him in their team			0
' another friend , @entity129 used the cliche – ' mr @entity1 ' to describe him , and then went on : ' you can see what the team and the club mean to him			1
his reactions after every game , he always comes over to the @entity139 and gets the rest of the team over as well to applaud the fans			0
a few games ago he signed my shirt , got on the team coach , then got off again and offered a family tickets as he thought he ’d heard them say they had travelled but could n’t get in to the game			2
it ’s a side of him that shows what the fans mean to him and a side that not enough people and media see			0
' another colleague , the @entity159 defender @entity158 , told me this : ' @entity5 is the best ever @entity1 youth product , best ever @entity1 centre back , and most successful captain ever			1
he ’s still so important to the club on and off the field – captain , leader , legend			2
with so many foreign players at @entity1 , and so few homegrown players to come through over the last 15 years , he represents the fans on the pitch and plays with the same passion , pride and love for @entity1 that we fans have in the stands for the club			1
it will be impossible to replace him			0
@entity5 and his @entity1 team - mates celebrate winning their first @entity184 title in 2005			1

@entity5 was man of the match as @entity1 won the @entity72
@entity5 is on course to lift his *fourth* @entity184 title as captain
has been a mainstay throughout most successful period in club 's *history*
@entity1 have a huge task replacing @entity5 when he eventually retires
