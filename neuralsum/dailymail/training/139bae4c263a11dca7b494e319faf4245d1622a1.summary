a judge is preparing to rule on whether to grant prosecution lawyers an appeal against the decision not to convict @entity4 of murder after he admitted shooting his girlfriend @entity6 at his home on @entity8 last year a judge has postponed her decision on whether to grant a state appeal that could open the way for @entity4 to serve more time behind bars - or even allow him to temporarily walk free from prison			1
prosecution lawyers have applied for an appeal after judge @entity17 in october sentenced the @entity19 gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest			1
@entity4 , who was not in court for the hearing , admits shooting his girlfriend @entity6 four times through a locked toilet door on @entity8 2013 , insisting he thought she was an intruder			1
the judge found him guilty of culpable homicide , also known as manslaughter , rather than a more serious charge of murdering @entity6			2
addressing judge @entity17 in the same @entity34 courtroom where the murder trial was conducted , prosecutor @entity31 said she had made a mistake in her interpretation of the law			0
he told her : ' there is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this , my lady , is shockingly inappropriate			0
' judge @entity17 however says she will respond to the prosecution 's appeal on wednesday			2
ahead of the application , miss @entity6 's mother , june , said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter 's death			1
she told @entity56 from @entity57 : ' i wanted the truth ( at the trial ) , but it seems some of the puzzle is missing			0
' there 's only two people who know what happened			0
one of them 's my daughter and she 's not here anymore			0
' she said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family			2
' so it does n't really matter how long - he 's going to know that he ca n't go around hurting people			0
' mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity82 previously said they felt ' let down ' by @entity85 's justice system after @entity4 was acquitted of murder			1
in a bizarre twist , @entity87 , one of @entity85 's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials , said @entity4 could apply for bail even though it ' would cause a public outcry '			1
he told @entity94 : ' they could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence			2
' the prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down			0
' ' shockingly inappropriate sentence ' : addressing judge @entity17 in the same @entity34 court where the murder trial was conducted , prosecutor @entity31 ( above ) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law if judge @entity17 ( above ) grants the appeal , the case will be heard in @entity85 's @entity114 in @entity115 , the country 's judicial capital mr @entity87 , who predicted the collapse of the @entity119 trial weeks ago , said he thought judge @entity17 would grant prosecutors leave to appeal @entity4 conviction and sentence later today			1
another lawyer said the decision to throw out the @entity119 murder trial in @entity126 yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair			1
prosecutor @entity31 argued in appeal papers filed last month that @entity17 misinterpreted the law when she ruled @entity4 did not intentionally shoot @entity6 , describing the sentence as ' shockingly light ' and ' inappropriate '			1
@entity4 , a @entity85 athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able - bodied runners in the @entity136 , can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars , which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls			2
should @entity17 grant the appeal , the case will be heard in @entity85 's @entity114 in @entity115 , the country 's judicial capital			0
@entity6 's parents @entity148 and @entity150 , previously said they felt ' let down ' by @entity85 's justice system after @entity4 was acquitted of murder , bit found guilty of manslaughter but the judge may not necessarily grant the appeal , siding with defence lawyers representing the athlete who say her interpretation of the law was correct			1
' it does n't matter what the outcome of the appeal is , if the appeal is allowed then other judges will be able to comment on the decision , and that 's critical , ' said @entity168 , who has been following the @entity4 case throughout the year			1
@entity168 said that with the decision of a @entity126 court yesterday to throw out the @entity119 case - another high - profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - @entity85 's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair			1
' from a perception point of view , both public and internationally , we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system			1
' @entity4 , who celebrated his 28th birthday last month , has been serving his sentence in a @entity34 prison			0
behind bars : @entity4 admits shooting his girlfriend @entity6 ( pictured ) four times through a locked toilet door on @entity8 last year , telling the court he thought she was an intruder if @entity17 refuses to grant the appeal , the state can petition the decision , a common legal strategy in @entity85			1
' i honestly do n't think that @entity17 would refuse leave to appeal , there 's just too much controversy about the judgement , ' said @entity168 , a criminal lawyer based in @entity198			2
' he 's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners			0
there are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed , ' said his older brother @entity210 , in an interview with you magazine , a @entity85 tabloid			0
@entity4 has been accused of receiving special treatment in @entity85 's notoriously corrupt prisons , where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars			2
yet @entity210 dismissed claims his brother is living the good life , saying @entity4 relies on weekly 45 - minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks , including baked beans and canned pilchards			0
' he now lives moment by moment , ' said @entity210			0
' there 's no fairytale			0
