by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 17:15 est , 24 october 2013 seeking to avoid a repeat of @entity4 's much - maligned public debut , @entity1 revealed more modest ambitions on thursday , saying its initial public offering would raise up to $ 1.6 billion and value the company at up to $ 10.9 billion			1
the valuation was far more conservative than the $ 15 billion that some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon			1
@entity1 , which has signaled for weeks that it would price its ipo conservatively to avoid the stock drop that marred @entity4 's offering , said that it intends to sell 70 million shares priced between $ 17 and $ 20			1
@entity15 : @entity16 , has seen the company he founded valued at $ 10.9 billion today as details of its ipo were released to @entity20 @entity1 is expected to set the price on november 6 , according to a document seen by @entity23 , suggesting that the stock could begin trading as early as november 7			1
the tech - company hopes to raise between $ 1.25 billion and $ 1.44 billion , according to an amended version of its prospectus filed on thursday			1
@entity1 said on thursday that there will be 544,696,816 shares of its common stock outstanding after the offering			0
the company and its underwriters will begin a two - week road show on october 28 in @entity36 and will stop in @entity37 and the @entity38 before touching down in @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , according to a source familiar with the offering			2
' it 's conservative and likely going to be raised as they start the road show at least once if not twice , ' @entity44 of @entity45 , a private company research firm , said of @entity1 's pricing			1
' the size of the offering is also a bit small , ' he added			0
' but they may only choose to raise the price once they gauge investor demand			0
raising both the price and the size was @entity4 's fatal mistake			0
' @entity4 aggressively raised its price in the days leading up to its ipo and when it hit the market , it tanked dramatically - at one stage losing half its value			0
an investigation was launched into the public offering and it is significant that @entity1 has chosen to launch on @entity66 and not on @entity67			0
@entity1 co-founder @entity16 ( right ) attended the @entity69 tech conference in july with girlfriend @entity70 the ipo is one of the most highly anticipated ipos in tech history with @entity1 the last of the major social networking sites to go public			1
it comes after @entity4 floated on the @entity77 stock market in may 2012 for $ 104 billion and , despite seeing an initial slump in shares , has since had a resurgence			0
it is thought that like @entity4 , @entity1 bosses ' hands were forced by the @entity84 which requires a @entity77 firm to file an ipo once it has reached 2,000 investors			1
although the ipo was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $ 1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions , naturally , with a tweet in september			2
the company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation			0
but it is still small in comparison to @entity4 , which saw its highly anticipated ipo implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue			0
the decision to float the company is likely to see the company 's founders @entity16 , @entity107 and @entity108 stand to gain huge financial windfalls			1
the site was founded in march 2006 but has become one of the world 's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years			0
@entity108 is one of @entity1 's three co-founders			2

@entity107 age : 41 net worth : $ 1 - $ 2billion potential worth : $ 3billion @entity128 estimated that he has a 12 per cent share in the company			1
his firms have also founded @entity119 and @entity118			0
@entity107 , a vegetarian , lives in the @entity133 with his wife @entity134 and the pair have two children			0

although he made his name with @entity1 , most of his current fortune is thought to have been amassed through his estimated 25 per cent stake in mobile payment start up @entity150			2
he is a certified masseur and lives in @entity40			0
role : executive chairman at @entity1 , ceo at @entity150 @entity108 age : 39 net worth : thought to be around $ 200million potential worth : around $ 2billion as well as @entity1 , @entity108 , full name @entity157 , helped to create and launch @entity159 , @entity119 , @entity160 and @entity118			2
he is also ceo of a 2012 start - up called @entity162 , thought to be a mobile app. he has written two books on blogging and made his directorial debut as part of @entity168 with @entity169			0
role : co-inventor and co-founder of @entity1 , ceo of @entity162 the 36 - year - old is also the founder and ceo of @entity150 , a mobile payments company			1
he is reportedly living in a $ 10 million home in @entity40 and dating his longtime girlfriend , @entity70			1
@entity16 's interest in programming began at the ripe age of eight , according to a 2011 @entity182 article			2
he came up with the idea for @entity1 in his 20s and shared it with @entity108 and @entity107 , two of his bosses at @entity40 software startup @entity160			1
@entity107 embraced the idea and made @entity16 , who was 29 at the time , the founding ceo of the new company			1
@entity108 , 39 , and @entity107 , 41 , have also helped create @entity119 , @entity118 , and a host of other @entity191 ventures			0
@entity16 is currently thought to be worth around $ 1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase by another half a billion			1
others that stand to gain from @entity1 going public include early investors @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 , as well as @entity203 founder @entity202 , @entity205 co-founder @entity204 , @entity206 and @entity207			2
in may of last year , @entity4 priced its ipo in may 2012 at $ 38 per share , but the stock fell almost immediately , trading well below its launch price			2
the stock continued to fall over the next couple months , trading at $ 22 per share by september 2012			0
a year later , however , share prices have made a full recovery			0
@entity1 's valuation is relatively conservative â€” some analysts had expected the figure to be as high as $ 20 billion			1
back in august @entity1 priced some of its employee stock options at $ 20.62			2
the caution shows that @entity1 learned from @entity4 's rocky initial public offering last year			2
rather than set expectations too high , @entity1 is playing it safe and will very likely raise its price range closer to the ipo , and thus fuel demand			1
@entity1 's smaller ipo seems to suggest that @entity224 has learned the lessons of @entity4 's ipo , which was marred by technical glitches on the @entity67 stock exchange in may of 2012			1
those problems likely led @entity1 to the @entity66			0
the @entity40 - based short - messaging service , which has roughly 230 million active users , has said it plans to list its stock under the ' @entity1 ' symbol on the @entity66			1
