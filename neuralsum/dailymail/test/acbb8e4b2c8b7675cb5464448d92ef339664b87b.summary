@entity0 has been working on a new , more open stance with former @entity3 batting coach @entity2 over the past few months			1
but in the first test against the @entity6 , i think he overdid it			2
the picture below shows @entity0 playing against @entity9 at @entity10 in 2007 — when he was playing well — with a near perfect stance			0
his front foot is slightly open but not too far past the line of leg stump			1
compare that to the other picture from last week , in which his front foot is far too open			2
it means that he has a long way to go to get to off stump , and he does n't have time to adjust to the delivery and set himself			1
@entity0 has been working on a new stance , but he appears to have overdone it against the @entity6 @entity3 head coach @entity27 and @entity0 stand together during a nets session in @entity29 on monday @entity0 prepares to play a shot during a training session at the @entity32 in @entity33 @entity0 plays a shot during a training session at the @entity32 in @entity33 on monday in this scenario , because his front foot is still landing as the ball is halfway down , he is forced to play the shot with his hands away from his body , which is when you 're most likely to nick the ball to the wicketkeeper or slips			1
he 's clearly trying to open up his shoulders — perhaps he felt a bit closed off last summer — but he moved his front foot way too far against the @entity6 and when you 're out of nick and under pressure , your movements become exaggerated			1
it 's important to note that in the second picture he has already started to move , making his footwork look worse than it is , but also that @entity0 has never been a brilliant front - foot player			2
he 's at his best when he gets his movements out of the way early , giving him time to move to the pitch of the ball and bend his front knee into the drive			0
of course , when you 're in form you do n't think about these things			0
but this is the hardest thing to do			0
@entity0 's greatest asset is his mental strength , and what he needs to do in matches is give himself 20 minutes to get settled			0
after a few boundaries it 'll all come naturally			0
saying that , i saw him in the nets on sunday and he looked bloody good ! so do n't write him off yet			0
@entity0 plays a shot during day one of the first test match between @entity6 and @entity3 last week @entity0 kicks out in frustration after being dismissed for 13 runs by a catch from @entity81 on wednesday			1

@entity3 *captain* @entity0 has been working on a new batting stance
his new stance has his front foot too far out without *protecting* the wicket
as a result , he does n't have time to adjust to the delivery and set himself
@entity0 probably overdid his new stance against the @entity6
still , he should n't be written off just yet and impressed in training
