as the stars line up on the red carpet at the @entity3 in @entity4 later today , there will undoubtedly be a number who have resorted to a bizarre and controversial cosmetic ‘ pick - me - up ’ in a bid to look their best			1
the celebrity trend for injecting vitamins directly into the body has been endorsed by everyone from actress @entity13 and singer @entity14 – who reportedly does it to perk up her bottom – to supermodel @entity17 and pop star @entity18 , who are said to rely on the jabs as an antidote to their hard - partying lifestyles			1
now , patients have another option			1
it ’s called mesotherapy and involves having the infusions directly under the skin on the face , in an effort to reverse environmental damage from sun exposure , pollution and stress , and even cellulite			1
before and after : @entity35 opted for mesotherapy treatment shortly before her 40th birthday last summer and said she saw results almost immediately insiders claim @entity41 a-listers opt for this facial treatment over cosmetic surgery or other more aggressive treatments prior to ‘ awards season ’ as the results are subtle and there is little down time			1
and now @entity50 clinics offer mesotherapy as a ‘ natural ’ alternative to anti-wrinkle injections of @entity54 and fillers , and which can also be ‘ done in your lunch hour ’			1
some clinics are even offering huge discounts of more than 70 per cent on group purchase websites			1
but the trend comes with a warning			1
dr @entity63 , medical director of @entity64 and co-founder and fellow of the @entity67 of @entity68 , says : ‘ there is little clinical data to back up the often exaggerated claims			1
' it sounds wonderful to inject all these essential elements into the skin , but think very carefully before you agree to go ahead			1
’ and the @entity76 for @entity77 says it will not endorse mesotherapy until further research validates its effectiveness			1
cheeky girl : injections gave @entity14 a ' derriere lift ' in @entity85 , companies are barred from claiming it can remedy the dimpled skin of cellulite , while in @entity90 there were reports the treatment resulted in a number of patients developing skin abscesses on their calves , buttocks , thighs , abdomen , shoulders , face or neck			1
the treatment takes its name from the mesoderm , the middle layer of the skin , which is penetrated during the procedure			1
this involves dozens of ‘ micro-injections ’ delivering a cocktail of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , minerals , amino acids , enzymes , elastin and moisturising hyaluronic acid			1
this , say advocates , stimulates fibroblasts , the skin cells that produce collagen – a protein providing the firmness that becomes depleted with age			1
full effects are apparent after two weeks with , typically , two to four treatments spaced two to three weeks apart needed			1
sessions cost from £ 180			1
nurse @entity131 , co-founder of dr @entity133 ’s clinic in @entity134 , where a facial version of mesotherapy , the @entity137 , was pioneered , says : ‘ we recommend this from the age of 30 onwards , two or three times a year for the best effect			1
' it ’s like using the best anti-ageing cream for a year , but all in one go			2
’ one patient to have braved the needle is @entity35 , who runs a bed - and - breakfast in @entity148			2
she opted for mesotherapy treatment shortly before her 40th birthday last summer			2
she had been reluctant to try other injections such as @entity54 , the jab that paralyses facial muscles , and so smooths out the lines and crevices that expressions such as frowning create			1
calmer , easier , happier boys : the @entity156 by parenting expert @entity157 ( @entity158 ) a parenting expert ’s strategies for raising confident boys			2
£ 10.49 , @entity162 she says : ‘ the discomfort of mesotherapy is akin to having your legs waxed , but bearable			2
afterwards , i was left with just a few tiny little cat - like scratches on my neck , which i could cover up with foundation			2
‘ i could see a difference in my skin immediately			1
my husband could see straight away too , and he was impressed			2
over the next two weeks i saw the full effects develop			2
my skin was plumper and more dewy and the tone was better , much less blotchy			1
i like to get a tan on holiday and i am a smoker , so the treatment made a difference			2
my fine lines were reduced and i looked like a more youthful , glowier version of me			2
’ @entity35 also had dr @entity133 ’s ‘ 10 - minute facelift ’ , involving injections of a gel containing chemicals called @entity188 ( @entity189 ) , costing £ 400			1
she says : ‘ after turning 40 , i left my job in advertising to run the b&b by the sea with my husband			2
my younger - looking face matches my new , less stressful lifestyle			1
’ three ways to treat varicose veins varicose veins can lead to complications such as blood clots , eczema and venus ulcers ( file image ) @entity206 : varicose veins develop when the valves inside the veins stop working properly			2
if these valves weaken or are damaged , the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein , leaving it swollen and enlarged			2
not only are they unsightly , but they can lead to complications such as blood clots , eczema and venus ulcers			2
professor @entity217 , professor of vascular surgery at the @entity219 , says : ‘ old age , being overweight and pregnancy can increase your chances of developing them , but it can be down to genetics			0
’ he adds : ‘ being on your feet a lot can exacerbate the condition – many of my patients are doctors , teachers and hairdressers – so try to transfer your weight from one foot to the other if you have to stand still for long periods			1
compression stockings also help to improve circulation			0
’ treat : prof @entity217 says your first port of call should be your gp , who should refer you to a specialist for an ultrasound to look at the extent of the problem			0
‘ the best way to get rid of varicose veins is non-surgical treatment to block off the affected vein so it dies , ’ he adds			0
‘ this can be done with endothermal ablation , which uses radio waves or lasers to seal the veins , and foam sclerotherapy , where foam is injected into your veins to seal them			0
only 15 per cent of people see the veins coming back eight years after treatment			0
’ do n’t bother : topical creams containing ingredients such as @entity114 are marketed to ease swelling , but there is insufficient evidence to prove they are effective			0
also avoid ‘ stripping ’ surgery , which involves tying off the vein and removing it			0
the procedure can cause bleeding , pain and nerve damage or deep - vein thrombosis in more serious cases			0
the operation : @entity280 surgery for @entity281 endometriosis is a condition affecting 1.5 million @entity50 women , where cells that behave like the ones in the lining of the womb grow elsewhere in the body			1
these cells react to the monthly menstrual cycle and also bleed , but there is no way for this blood to leave the body			1
this leads to pain , swelling and sometimes fertility problems if the fallopian tubes or ovaries are damaged			0
in laparoscopic , or keyhole surgery , small incisions are made in the stomach so the endometriosis tissue can be destroyed or cut out using a laser , heat or electric current			0
the surgeon says consultant gynaecologist @entity312 , a member of charity endometriosis @entity50 ’s medical advisory panel , says : ‘ the surgery is performed under general anaesthetic , but i aim to have patients home the same day			1
i ’d book two weeks off work so you can concentrate on getting back to your best			0
‘ you will be tender because of the cuts in your stomach , so you can feel period - type pains or that you ’ve done too many sit - ups			0
the rule of thumb is do n’t try to lift anything heavier than a kettle or a bag of shopping for a few days			0
‘ do n’t spring out of bed in the morning			0
instead roll on to your side , drop your feet on the floor and come up sideways			0
baths are fine , but go for a quick dip rather than a long soak			0
your appetite will also be affected , so stock up on easy - to - digest , quick - to - prepare foods such as soup			0
‘ you should be fine to return to work at the end of the two weeks , but driving could take longer			0
practise getting in and out of the car and if you feel uncomfortable , do n’t start the engine			0
’ the patient says @entity343 , 32 , an office manager from @entity344 , had keyhole surgery in may 2014			0
she says : ‘ the pain after the procedure was uncomfortable , but not unbearable			0
i booked four days off work but should have taken two weeks as i felt quite delicate sitting at my desk all day as my tummy was still sore			0
‘ i was told it might be a few days before i felt better , so i made sure i filled the fridge and tidied round the house			0
' i 'm glad i did as going to the supermarket or doing the hoovering was the last thing i was thinking of			0
' the one thing i wish i ’d known was that they fill your stomach up with gas during the operation			0
although it is released , i was left with a bloated feeling			0
peppermint tea was a godsend			0
