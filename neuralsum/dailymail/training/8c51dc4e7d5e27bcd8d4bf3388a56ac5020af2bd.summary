mr @entity22 , 37 , said : ' we were surprised that the original stamp was intact and it was in such good condition			2
' we thought it was pretty funny that the @entity27 decided to deliver it and that there was n’t even a note on it			1
' we are also wondering where it could have been all these years			0
it would be quite interesting if we could track its very long journey			2
' despite its long and delayed journey , the card is in good condition , with the stamp still intact			1
intended recipient @entity16 points out that postcodes were n't in general use at the time a delighted mr @entity16 said the card had come from an old pen pal , @entity42 , who he ’d been writing to since he was 17			1
@entity42 had sent the postcard as a thank you after mr @entity16 had looked after her father during a visit to @entity48			1

@entity64 but the card never turned up and mr @entity16 , a retired finance worker , said it was then that the pair lost touch			1
mr @entity16 , who also lives in @entity9 , said he was ‘ totally surprised ’ when it finally reached him 49 years after it was posted			1
' the postcard thanked me for looking after her dad and passing on gifts			0
she was a very dear friend			0
it was quite a pleasant time in my life			0
' in those days people did n’t have postcodes and i think this could have been one of the reasons it went missing			0
i ca n’t imagine how it got back into the system again			2
' the card was stamped by @entity27 in @entity84 on monday , october 29 , 2012			1
the @entity27 has dismissed the possibility that it had gone missing in their system and suggested it must have been put in a postbox recently			1
spokesman @entity89 said : ' it is extremely unlikely that this item of mail was in our system all this time			2
' it is difficult to speculate what may have happened , but almost certainly it was put back in a postbox very recently , as we regularly check all our sorting offices and machines are cleared			0
' a letter posted in @entity103 - @entity102 , @entity104 in 1929 , finally arrived in @entity105 , @entity106 , 79 years later			2
