by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 6 september 2013 mr @entity1 said officials had kept him in the dark about problems @entity1 accused his own civil servants of a lack of ‘ professionalism ’ yesterday as the row deepened over the government ’s troubled welfare reforms			1
the @entity11 said he had ‘ lost faith ’ in the ability of @entity16 mandarins to deliver the flagship @entity19 scheme , and had now turned to outside experts			1
mr @entity1 said officials had kept him in the dark about problems with the £ 2.4billion scheme , which was severely criticised by the @entity24 yesterday			1
he said some officials ‘ did not tell the truth ’ about how the project was going			2
in a devastating report , the @entity16 spending watchdog said @entity19 has been beset by ‘ weak management , ineffective control and poor governance ’			1
the scheme , which will replace a string of out - of - work benefits , is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours			0
the @entity24 said the complex project , which so far has only been tested in pilot schemes , has ‘ not achieved value for money ’ – and suggested plans to extend it nationally by 2017 should be delayed			2
but , in a finding that was seized on by mr @entity1 , the watchdog also accused officials of developing a ‘ fortress mentality ’ and a culture of only passing on good news			1
he insisted the scheme would be delivered ‘ on time and in budget ’ , despite problems with the computer system that have already led to £ 34million of equipment being written - off			2
the @entity58 reported yesterday that a further £ 162million could be written off in the coming weeks			0
former chancellor @entity59 accused him of ¿ blaming all those around him for letting him down ¿ mr @entity1 said he had intervened last year to bring in new managers to get the project back on track			1
‘ i never expected to have to do that , ’ he told the @entity64			2
‘ when i arrived , i expected professionalism to be able to do this			0
’ his comments angered @entity69 , who said mr @entity1 should take responsibility for the problems with the project			1
former chancellor @entity59 accused him of ‘ blaming all those around him for letting him down ’			0
he added : ‘ i ’ve listened to you , claiming that this is on track and in budget , which i find extraordinary since the @entity24 says this is anything but			0
’ mr @entity59 said he had looked at a similar scheme when he was in @entity82 and been warned it would be ‘ technically difficult , if not impossible , to deliver at a reasonable cost ’			2
@entity86 mp @entity85 told mr @entity1 : ‘ can i remind you that it was you who signed off the contract which led to those project management failures			1
so , rather than simply blaming civil servants , why do n’t you accept the blame yourself ? ’ during angry exchanges @entity86 work and pensions spokesman @entity95 suggested mr @entity1 had misled the public and mps by repeatedly claiming the project was going well , despite major concerns behind the scenes			1
he urged him to apologise			0
referring to mr @entity1 ’s description of himself as ‘ the @entity102 ’ when he was @entity103 leader , mr @entity95 said : ‘ the @entity102 must not become the @entity104			1
’ mr @entity1 snapped back that mr @entity95 ’s criticisms were ‘ pathetic ’			1
he was backed by @entity106 yesterday , which said it was confident the 2017 target would be met , despite a string of delays			0
the @entity24 report underlines concerns within @entity16 that the government ’s biggest single reform is in danger of going off track			0
the report found the it system could not identify potentially fraudulent claims , meaning manual checks were needed on claims and payments			0
‘ such checks will not be feasible or adequate once the system is running nationally , ’ it added			0
mr @entity1 insisted that all of the report ’s concerns had already been addressed			1
the civil service is a ‘ failing organisation ’ that needs sweeping reforms to bring it into the 21st century , mps warned last night			0
the @entity64 public administration committee said in a report that @entity16 mandarins were ‘ in denial ’ about the scale of the problems facing an organisation once likened to a @entity142 machine			1
mps said cabinet office minister @entity145 was right to try to reform the civil service , but his plans were ‘ too modest and piecemeal ’ and were ‘ bound to fail ’			0
the convention of ministers taking responsibility for major mistakes in their department has gone and there is an ‘ atmosphere ’ of ministers blaming officials and vice versa			2
the result is that ‘ few ministers or officials seem to be held accountable when things go wrong ’			2
the report said : ‘ the civil service exhibits the key characteristics of a failing organisation in which most people know the system is failing , where nobody knows how to address failure , and the leadership are in denial about the scale of the challenge they face			0
’ mps called for a parliamentary committee to be established to address the problems from scratch .			0
