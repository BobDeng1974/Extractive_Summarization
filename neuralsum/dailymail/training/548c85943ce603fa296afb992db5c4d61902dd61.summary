wide load : slapping a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks would cut the number of fat @entity5 by more than a quarter of a million , claims a new report by experts from a range of groups including @entity23 and @entity24 universities the tax would raise £ 276million a year to help the @entity27 cope with the burden of obesity - related illnesses , says the report			1
people aged 16 to 30 would be most affected as they are the highest consumers of soft drinks			1
there have been growing calls for a tax on soft drinks with high sugar content as a way of cutting the rise in obesity , diabetes and tooth decay			1
researchers said the tax ‘ is predicted to reduce the number of people in the @entity5 who are obese by 1.3 per cent or 180,000 people , and the number who are overweight or obese by 0.9 per cent or 285,000 people ’			1
the overall fall in the number of overweight and obese people would be 2.2 per cent , says the study published on @entity54			1
the report , which was carried out by researchers at the @entity57 , @entity58 at the @entity23 and the @entity59 at the @entity24 , estimates that a sugar tax would put 12p on a 330ml can bought in a supermarket			2
a typical soft drink contains between six and 15 teaspoons of sugar , with one teaspoon containing 16 calories			2
the price of a 500ml bottle of @entity68 , which contains 210 calories and 14 teaspoons of sugar , would rise from £ 1.15 to £ 1.38			2
and 500ml of @entity71 , which has 13 teaspoons of sugar , would jump from £ 1.18 to £ 1.42			0
in an accompanying editorial for @entity73 , @entity74 , assistant professor at @entity75 , backed a proposal by the @entity77 for @entity5 to pilot the effects of a one year 20 per cent tax on soft drinks			1
@entity81 , chief executive of the @entity57 , which helped fund the study , said : ‘ guzzling fizzy drinks is now the daily norm for around 40 per cent of 13 - year - olds			2
' the effects on young people ’s health are a major concern			0
‘ this research suggests that a health - related food duty , alongside other measures such as the new front of pack food labelling scheme , could be an effective way – particularly in young people – to help reduce obesity			0
’ however , critics dismissed the tax proposal , saying it would only affect a minority of the population			0
@entity105 , @entity106 at @entity107 , said the tax might have a marginal effect on ‘ cola addicts ’			0
she added : ‘ for the rest of us , sadly , this approach would have very little impact on adult weight management			0
' why ? because government data shows the incidence of obesity rises with increasing age , peaking in the 45 - 74 age group			0
’ @entity121 , professor of nutrition and dietetics , school of medicine , @entity125 , said it was ‘ very naive ’ to think tax could so easily manipulate calorie intake			0
‘ the cost of sugar - sweetened beverages is currently so low that any price increase would be so marginal that it would be unlikely to affect intake , ’ he said			0
‘ you can buy 3 litres of orange squash ( 28 per cent sugar ) for £ 1 in discount stores			0
