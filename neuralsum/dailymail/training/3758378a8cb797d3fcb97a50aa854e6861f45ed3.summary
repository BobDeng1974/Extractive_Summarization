@entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , we are often exposed to photos of idyllic parenthood			0
but one photographer was determined to uncover the real chaos that most families suffer at the hands of their young children			2
@entity14 , from @entity15 , wanted to showcase the sentiment that parenthood is n't a walk in the park with her photo series @entity20			1
@entity14 , who has a five - year - old son , began creating her comedy photographs after attempts to take traditional family portraits would ' spiral out of control '			1
she said it was one particularly trying session that saw her move on to her humorous family portraits			0
the series aims to capture the true struggles parents face on the daily with the simplest tasks - such as crossing the road @entity14 began her series after several traditional family portrait sessions spiralled out of control			1
left , a family meal in a restaurant with children eating spaghetti and a mum screaming			0
right , a mum tries to shower as her little boy draws on the glass - while a baby looks on this photo ' parenting is exhausting ' was the first taken in the series after clients at a photo shoot asked the photographer to ' take a funny one ' she told @entity72 : ' i have a regular client that i photograph , and i was over at her house			0
it was at the end of the session , and the mom , [ who ] is always a total blast , just laid down on the couch , and i [ said ] we should do a funny one			0
' she has a wonderful sense of humor , [ and ] she was all about it ! and then it just spiralled out of control in a really great way			2
' the result was @entity14 's first photograph of the series called ' parenting is exhausting ' which sees a couple flopped on the sofa while their kids wreak havoc			1
although the images are hugely exaggerated @entity14 hopes to capture the difficulties parents face - such as balancing everything at once @entity14 wanted to strip away the pristine facade that often comes with family portraits in her series many of @entity14 's images focus mainly on the mum 's struggle with getting children ready from this successful experience , the photographer was inspired to strip away the pristine facade from family portraits in order to reveal the pandemonium that often accompanies everyday life with small children			1
although the images are humorously exaggerated , @entity14 hopes to capture many of the feelings that parents may experience as they try to balance everything from work and chores to sleep and childcare			1
@entity14 's unorthodox approach to family portraits has proven popular			1
after seeing some of @entity129 's creative shots other parents began reaching out to the photographer to request their own ' chaotic portraits '			0
the photographer is a mother herself so the series is particularly personal - including this shot of parents trying not to disturb their baby her photos have become so popular that @entity14 now regularly photographs unpredictable family situations - in this one , a new father is pictured holding a sleeping baby as he reaches for his mobile phone @entity14 says that although parenting can be really ugly there are some really beautiful moments since then , @entity129 has been kept busy photographing the unpredictable moments of many different families			1
@entity14 said she believed it was the honesty of her photographs that makes them so enchanting			2
' this is real , this is life , this is parenting			0
parenting is so ugly , but there are moments that are so beautiful			0
just when you think you have it under control and you 're like , " oh , yeah , this is great			0
my kid 's using his manners , " they slam the door in your face and they scream at you ! ' but nothing in life is perfect			2
