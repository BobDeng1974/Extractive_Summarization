by @entity0 accusation : @entity1 at @entity2 where he was jailed for a string of lies a senior police officer 's 26 - year long career is over after he was jailed for lying on his cv to win a string of top jobs			1
@entity11 , 46 , from @entity12 appeared at @entity2 yesterday , after a four year inquiry into claims he exaggerated and fabricated his work achievements to clinch promotion to higher ranks with various forces across the @entity19			1
the court heard heard how the superintendent falsely claimed to have a university degree - a @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 - and said he had taken part into the investigation into the tragedy of a young @entity29 woman who was found starved to death inside her car			1
he also lied about the identity of his line manager			1
police began investigating @entity1 , described as a ' capable and highly ambitious ' officer after he was offered a transfer to the @entity34 in 2009 - just five months after landing a job at the @entity39 force			2
human resources officials noticed that he had failed to seek the support of a senior officer for the application , which would be normal practice and sensed something was wrong with @entity1 's application			2
officers later checked the veracity of his degree which he claimed to have obtained from the @entity49 in 1996			1
the degree certificate was found to be a forgery and inquiries showed there was no record of him being on the course			1
the investigators checked out a library where @entity1 said he met with his tutor to find it had no formal links with higher education and was n't used by lecturers and students			2
promotion : @entity1 lied about being involved in the investigation into an @entity29 woman 's death to give potential employers the impression he had relevant experience in dealing with race and diversity issues it emerged that @entity1 had lied about being involved in the investigation into the @entity29 woman 's death to give potential employers the impression that he had relevant experience in dealing with race and diversity issues			1
he also upgraded his @entity81 in applications			2
it is thought he made £ 70,000 from his illicit promotions			2
during his appearance at @entity2 , mr @entity1 , who has been suspended from his £ 60,000 a year job since september 2011 showed no emotion as he was found guilty of fraud and misconduct in a public office after a week long trial			1
he was jailed for 18 months			1
judge @entity93 told him : ' you were able to take advantage of the process to make untrue and misleading representations about your career and able to improve , thus gaining an advantage over candidates			2
' in other words you cheated and your promotion resulted in a significant salary increase			2
' you made applications over two years , a total of five applications using some or all of these false particulars			2
' this was a serious breach of trust that the public places in all police officers , particular senior officers			1
' it undermines the integrity of the police			2
your conduct fell fall below what the public requires			1
' it is a tragedy , you were a highly regarded police officer			2
you may well have achieved promotion later without telling lies			2
ambition got the better of you and you decided to cheat			0
you have effectively lost everything as a result of this case			0
you have let down the police and public confidence in the police			1
' jailed : mr @entity1 , showed no emotion as he was found guilty of fraud at @entity2 , pictured , earlier in the trial , mr @entity1 had told how he joined the @entity34 in 1988 and was promoted to sergeant eight yeas later			1

in october 2007 he transferred to @entity136 and was promoted to chief inspector			0
after a series of unsuccessful job applications he joined @entity39 as a superintendent in february 2009 but just three months into the job he applied to rejoin the @entity34 because he wanted to be involved in the policing of the @entity143			0
@entity144 began two months later in september 2009 when he was notified that his application to the @entity34 had been accepted and he told @entity146 he was leaving			1
the jury was told an investigation began after it emerged mr @entity1 's line manager at @entity39 had not made any recommendations in relation to the application and the move had been ' rather quick			1
' in december 2009 @entity39 was provided with mr @entity1 's application to the @entity34 which wrongly gave the name of line manager as a chief superintendent from the @entity136 force			0
@entity159 , prosecuting , told jurors : ' a subsequent investigation found that not only on that application , but on several occasions over some years , the defendant had made misleading statements and , indeed , fabricated information about himself , in order to support applications			0
' on application mr @entity1 falsely claimed to have taken part in a procedural review whilst at @entity172 following the high - profile death of computer engineer @entity174 who was found in her @entity176 in a @entity178 car park at @entity179 , @entity134 in august 1998			1
the review had taken place after claims five good samaritans phoned police but no officer went to see her in the ten days before her body was found			0
a post-mortem failed to find a cause of death but she weighed just 88lb and there was evidence of muscle wastage			0
in a successful application to @entity136 , mr @entity1 had claimed to have been involved in implementing or drafting ' new strategies ' as a result of the investigation			2
he plagiarised 16 lines from the application form of a colleague which claimed he had ' reviewed and challenged a raft of force policies regarding dealing with vulnerable people			1
' he said that he received expressions of gratitude , including from a coroner			0
he was given a formal interview by the @entity34 and the case of @entity174 was discussed			0
in feedback a chief superintendent talked of being struck by that example of showing sensitivity to minorities			0
but @entity1 's then - line manager in @entity133 , former chief superintendent @entity216 told the court there were ' inaccuracies ' in his application			0
she added that she was unaware that she had been put down as a ' verifier ' of his application , and that she was never contacted by his prospective employers			0
she said that it was rare that new employers would check the accuracy of an application			0
ms @entity216 said : ' there 's a definite skill in writing an application where you make the best and most of the evidence you have to present it to the employer			0
' however , mr @entity1 denied wrongdoing but was convicted after a trial after jurors took almost six hours to reach their majority verdicts			0
he is expected to be dismissed from the force			0
defence counsel mr @entity240 said mr @entity1 had always been an ' excellent police officer ' and during his career had to deal with the 1994 mortar attack by the @entity243 on @entity244			0
he was also assigned to protect high profile figures like diplomats and royalty			0
' this has been a complete humiliation for him to be in the dock and prosecuted ' said mr @entity251			0
' he is now a convicted fraudster and he is unsure of what future job prospects he will have			0
the punishment has already been severe humiliation and distress , that in itself will serve as punishment			0
' after the case deputy chief constable @entity259 , of @entity146 said : ' the public quite rightly have high expectations of police officers and @entity146 is committed to meeting those expectations by demanding high standards of professionalism , honesty and integrity			1
' @entity11 ’s behaviour has been proven in a court of law to be dishonest and led to his appointment to a senior position in @entity146			1
there is no doubt that his actions have been an embarrassing episode for @entity146			1
' it is vital that we maintain the public ’s trust and confidence and ensure that officers and staff throughout the police service realise the importance of maintaining standards and working with honesty and integrity			1
' we can not afford to have officers and staff working for us who do not uphold the highest levels of professionalism , honesty and integrity and will always be robust in dealing with officers , or staff , whose conduct is unacceptable			1
