enormous knitted mittens , bizarre hats made out of wooden planks , models with ' blacked out ' faces , and men sashaying down the catwalk in frilly dresses			1
this year 's @entity7 has been nothing if not outlandish			0
the three - day event , which started at the man show on monday with the aforementioned plank hats and blacked - up faces , has seen designers from @entity14 to @entity15 via @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 seemingly compete to out - crazy each other on the catwalk			1
the @entity22 event , sponsored by @entity17 , sees 60 menswear designers showcase their wares for autumn / winter 2013 in front of assembled press and buyers from over 45 countries - and is a showcase for what is a Â£ 6.5bn fashion industry			1
skirting the issue : @entity15 looks determined to make the male skirt a strong look for 2013 these boots were made for walking ! frilled knee - length boots on the @entity15 catwalk are you sure that 's not womenswear ? a model on the catwalk during the @entity44 show earlier on in the week , man , a collaboration between @entity17 and @entity47 , kicked off the craziness with models wearing lengths of splintered four - by - two across their faces			1
and things never recovered from there			0
@entity56 's a / w 2013 collection took inspiration from the traditional pub with garments made out of beer mats and bar towels			0
sibling , a collaboration between designers @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 described as being ' all for one and one for all ' , sent out embarrassed - looking models clad in enormous , loose - knit jumpers and mittens , complete with snoods that pulled up over their heads			2
many of the models would no doubt have preferred the garments to cover their faces too			2
looking good : men in dresses at the @entity15 show prints charming : a model on the catwalk at the @entity44 show purple reign : prints , purple , latex - this look has lots going on think pink ! @entity44 has been paying attention to @entity90 @entity91 : along with floral print , models at the @entity44 show also sported creepy vampire - style canines work it ! the key with carrying off these looks is all in the personality - perhaps these models failed to get the memo ? a few wore knitted jumpers with ' @entity104 ' spelled out in flowers on the front - echoing the thoughts of the beleaguered models wearing them , perhaps ? sibling 's design crew may have had good intentions , but in the real world , those looks were more for one than for all			1
at @entity15 the humiliation of the models was made truly complete , as the designer sent out his clan of put - upon male beauties wearing frilly shorts , leather dresses and frill - trimmed knee - length boots			2
one blond looked so down in the dumps it 's a wonder he did n't tear the offending garment off and run for the hills			0
then again , in those shoes , he would have had a job			0
model @entity128 , who is a @entity130 member as well as an ambassador for @entity7 ( known as @entity132 - said at the beginning of the event he wanted @entity22 to become the number one menswear fashion destination in the world			1
one thing is for sure : it would be a lot easier for it to become weirdest			0
stars who gathered to take in the sartorial circus included rapper @entity144 , rocker @entity145 , model @entity146 and actor @entity147 - all who seemed able to watch an entire show without crumpling into fits of giggles			2
whether any of them will be calling in any of the outrageous outfits to wear for their next red carpet event is another matter altogether			0
somehow , with those knobbly knees @entity145 has , you just ca n't imagine him in a pair of frilly shorts			0
the designers describe the sibling brand as ' knitwear for men with a very @entity205 humour ' ' @entity206 ' : one model 's super-sized scarf is teamed with a black and red leopard print top , left , while another has a jumper with ' @entity104 ' sewn out of flowers on his jumper , pictured right @entity145 you ? strange facial contraptions made using splintered wood at the man show carpentry chic : four by twos made for unusual accessories at @entity16 - but could you get through airport security wearing these ? bizarre : models seen backstage during the man show at the @entity132 @entity226 chic : man again , with more outlandish designs baggy trousers : parkas and @entity230 at @entity17 , and @entity231 , tailored shorts at @entity17 white out : a model at @entity17 @entity236 's @entity235 collection at the ' @entity132 : men ' menswear fashion event in @entity22 had a grungy 1990s feel to it with elements of tartan , wool knitwear , welded toe - capped boots and slim - fitting tailoring fashion week fans : @entity144 at the @entity17 show at the @entity132 earlier today , and right : model and @entity130 council member @entity128 , left , and fellow model @entity146 at the man show guests : @entity147 attends the @entity249 celebrates 60 years of @entity251 event at @entity252 in @entity22 ; right : @entity145 took new wife @entity253 to the @entity17 show jolly good show : @entity144 ( left ) and @entity145 and his wife @entity253 pictured enjoying the colourful display yesterday @entity258 sits next to @entity259 at the @entity261 fashion show take a bow ! designer @entity44 appears on stage at the end of her a / w13 show			1
