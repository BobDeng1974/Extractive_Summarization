students today backed a petition calling on their university union to cancel a ‘ sexist ’ comedian ’s gig			1
self - described ‘ proper lad ’ @entity12 - real name @entity13 - is due to bring his socially unacceptable tour to the @entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , in february			1
however , a petition demanding the union cancel the @entity17 ’s gig because of his ‘ trivialisation of rape , unprotected sex and dehumanising of women ’ has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days			1
' proper lad ' : comedian @entity12 , real name @entity13 , is currently on his socially unacceptable tour on the street : @entity12 came to fame for his online videos where he gives ‘ lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer ’			1
this still is from a vine video entitled ' compliments are key ' it states ‘ misogynistic humour should not be supported by an organisation that stands for equality ’			0
petition organiser @entity39 , 21 , a final - year journalism student , said : ‘ @entity12 is that bloke that every woman knows who dresses up sexism as banter			1
’ ‘ his jokes are so disrespectful to women and giving him a tv show and letting him perform at the university is normalising inappropriate behaviour			1
’ @entity12 , who hails from @entity53 , south - west @entity54 , came to fame for his online videos where he gives ‘ lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer ’			0
he now has his own programme on @entity60 called on the pull and has been accused of being a misogynist and encouraging men to harass women in public			1
future date : the @entity54 comedian is due to perform at @entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) ' lad ' : this still is from a @entity70 video showing @entity12 handing a beer to a @entity73 runner in his videos , which are peppered with very explicit language , he can be seen yelling sexual comments at women on the street or from his car as he drives past			1
last year , @entity82 voted to implement an ‘ anti-lad culture policy ’ to stamp out behaviour that encouraged ‘ gender , sexuality and rape - based humour ’			1
and miss @entity39 said : ‘ i think it is massively hypocritical for the students ’ union to allow him to come and play here when he embodies everything that is wrong about lad culture			1
‘ every time i go on a night out someone shouts at me or touches me			0
we need to do more to change the sexist culture at university			0
we need to make the university a safe place for women			2
’ comments posted on the petition include one from @entity106 , saying : ‘ this guy would be a joke himself if his stuff was n’t so insidious and damaging			2
it ’s not ok to victimise women like this , and it ’s massively exploitative to make a living out of rape jokes and sexism			1
it ’s not innocent “ banter ” , it ’s just offensive			0
’ making a stand : a petition demanding the union cancel the @entity17 ’s gig because of his ' trivialisation of rape , unprotected sex and dehumanising of women ' has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days @entity12 is one of the most successful comedians on mobile video app @entity70 , which distributes six - second clips playing on a loop			1
after starting out as a performer on cruise ships , he now has more than 500,000 followers on @entity70 and over a million @entity138 fans , as well as his own show on @entity60 and a popular live tour			2
however , critics have repeatedly accused @entity12 of sexism , arguing that his ' laddish ' humour relies on treating women as objects who should only be seen as sexual conquests			2
one reviewer of his tv show described his style of comedy as ' unpleasant sexism dressed up as banter ' , pointing to a scene in which he tells men they should not make friends with women because it reduces their chance of a one - night stand with them			2
his short videos repeatedly revolve around him advising men how to get no - strings sex , or feature him accosting women in the streets			2
however , defenders saying that @entity12 is nothing more than a comic persona for @entity169 , claiming that any sexism in his jokes is intended to be ironic			0
@entity173 added : ‘ i can not believe that an @entity174 ] that is so concerned about not encouraging lad culture that it completely rebranded one of its club nights would allow such a disgusting misogynist act to perform in it			0
‘ @entity12 trivialises rape , objectifies women and encourages other men to do the same			1
we should not be providing him with a platform on which to express his warped views			0
’ students ’ @entity82 president @entity191 said @entity12 had been booked to play their @entity8 venue by an external promoter and had not been vetted by the organisation			0
he added : ‘ we did n’t choose to have this person come to our venue and this situation has highlighted a gap in our policies - and as a result we will be reviewing them to make sure something like this does n’t happen again			0
‘ we are also looking into options to address the petition			2
we operate an anti-lad culture policy at our events and are committed to making the university a safe place for all students			0
’ @entity12 is also visiting @entity212 , @entity54 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 before performing in @entity219 on february 22			1
following that gig he will also play in @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224			0
however , none of his other forthcoming dates are at university or union venues			0
a spokesman for @entity12 did not immediately return a request for comment from @entity232 .			0
