for more than a year and a half , @entity1 's nose just would n't stop running			1
at first he put it down to year - round allergies caused by the @entity6 weather			1
the condition occurred once or twice a week , especially when he sat up in bed , but within a short time his nose ran constantly			1
he went to the doctor to be told fluid from his brain was leaking out eventually , mr @entity1 's condition became unbearable , ' i got to the point where i had tissues all the time ' he told @entity19			1
he finally went to the doctor to be told his runny nose was far from run - of - mill allergies : his brain was leaking			1
the problem would occur on a daily basis			0
' this clear liquid dribbled out of my nose like tears out of your eyes			2
i go what is this ? ' ' i got to the point where i had tissues all the time			2
my pockets were full of folded - up tissues			0
' @entity1 : he had to stuff his pockets full of tissues to soak up the non-stop dripping from his nose @entity41 : mr @entity1 believed the @entity6 climate was to blame for his ' allergies ' but a doctor told him a hole in his brains ' membrane was causing fluid to drip out it also caused @entity1 some embarrassing moments in public			1
on several occasions he failed to reach his tissues in time and fluid would spill out			2
around a teaspoonful splashed over some instructions for his model airplanes that he was building			0
after realising the allergy medication was having absolutely no effect whatsoever he went sought out medical advice			0
a doctor diagnosed the problem fairly soon afterwards			0
the membrane surrounding @entity1 's brain had a hole in it and his brain fluid was leaking out			1
' you do n't really think about it , but our brains are really just above our noses all of the time , ' said @entity75 neurosurgeon @entity74 to @entity19			0
' this is one of the more common conditions to be missed for a long time ... because so many people have runny noses			0
' @entity1 was about to have an operation to patch the hole when he contracted a case of near - deadly meningitis and the brain fluid became infected			1
advice : doctors suggest anyone experiencing similar symptoms should visit an allergist or an ear , nose and throat specialist dr. @entity74 explains that human bodies produce around 12 ounces of brain fluid each day which is enough to keep the brain from drying out and another reason why @entity1 's runny nose never stopped			1
doctors advise that if you have a runny nose , to first consult an allergist or an ear , nose and throat specialist			2
brain fluid is different to a runny nose caused by allergies because the liquid is exceptionally clear			1
there can be various causes that would set off a leak			0
sometimes a past head injury can lead to brain fluid leaking , or it can be caused from complications from a spinal tap or surgery ' these leaks can be very very tiny , a little like a puncture on a bicycle tire , that sometimes you have trouble even finding where it is			1
' mr @entity1 underwent surgery			1
it did n't require any cutting into the brain itself			0
instead the procedure is carried out through the nose and essentially glue was used to seal up the hole			2
' this is just a bit of cartilage from the nose that we can get to repair over it and then the body will seal it up , ' said @entity136			0
this week , the gauze was removed by doctors from his nose			2
@entity1 began to wait for the dripping to begin			2
' i was waiting for the dribble			0
this leaking cause i was so used to it every day			0
it 's never come back			0

@entity1 's nose ran constantly and he thought it was allergies
he put up with the condition for 18 months
doctors told him membrane surrounding the brain had a hole through which fluid was leaking
after surgery he 's fine and the tissues remain *untouched*
