a 47 - year - old caretaker obsessed throwing extravagant parties has just become the coolest kid in school - by building a giant pirate ship in his back garden			1
@entity6 can now make troublesome guests walk the plank on his 25ft creation - which he built himself and takes up half of his garden			1
he has been throwing themed birthday parties for years - he has treated friends to a @entity15 banquet , @entity17 barbecue and 1940s - style ball in the past			1
@entity20 me timbers ! school caretaker @entity6 has built a 25ft long pirate ship in his back garden eccentric : mr @entity6 ( left ) has always loved pirate ships , and spent six months on his creation but this year he has really had to put all hands on deck			1
the huge ship comes complete with rigging , a classic @entity31 and a 25ft high mast , and took six months to complete			1
incredibly , it even boasts a cannon , though neighbours will be very glad to know that it is not the real thing			2
mr @entity6 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' i have always loved pirates since i was a kid and then the @entity42 movies came out and it brought it all alive			2
monstrous : the ship 's mast is made from a telegraph pole and is 25ft high , complete with sheets and rigging ' i have had loads of themed parties but it seemed pirates was the one everybody loved the most			1
' i started putting the odd bit in last summer then it just grew and grew			0
i got the telegraph pole for the mast then it sort of got out of hand			2
' most of the stuff was just unwanted and school donated loads of fence panels			0
i really did n't spend that much money on it			0
' my friends and their kids love it			0
it is a good way to get everybody up and involved when i have a party			0
watch out below ! the land locked boat even boasts a pretend cannon which points out the back it 's party time ! mr @entity6 ' friends enjoy his months of hard work as they play around in the ship ' they all enjoy running around it , but i think i 'm the biggest kid of all			1
' mr @entity6 ' girlfriend has two children , who love playing on the ship , and the caretaker would like to make it even bigger			2
unfortunately that will not be possible however , as the firmly moored boat is already taking up too much space			0
the floor of the ship has been covered in decking while standard fence panels have been erected to give it its shape			0
just like the real thing : mr @entity6 has pulled out all the stops , adding a skeleton and lights for night time a captain 's cabin comes complete with a bench , wooden chest and a chiminea , while fish netting adorns the boat 's walls			1
the 25ft telegraph pole acts as the central mast while bed sheets and rope make up the vessel 's sails			2
and the whole thing is topped off , of course , with a creepy skeleton and a chirpy model parrot			0
it is about 25ft long and 15ft wide and has become somewhat of a talking point with pupils at the nearby @entity122 , where he works			0
mr @entity6 said : ' you can see it from the road , there 's a big flag flying and the mast - it 's quite a sight			1
' they walk past it every day and you can hear them laughing and joking .			0
