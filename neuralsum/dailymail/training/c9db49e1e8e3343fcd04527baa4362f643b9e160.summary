a study by ' friendship group @entity1 found that more than one - in - three over- 70s told researchers that they considered themselves ' very happy ' it is often said that the best times of our lives are when we are young			1
now , however , a survey suggests we are in fact happiest in our seventies – because after we reach retirement we rediscover the everyday joys of life			0
indeed , far from being grumpy old men and women , it seems @entity19 ’s senior citizens are more content than those younger than them			1
and the key to happiness , they say , is simple – good friends , good health and having the freedom to go shopping whenever you want			0
more than one in three over- 70s told researchers they considered themselves ‘ very happy ’ , compared to only one in six of those aged 50 to 60			1
the research revealed that the three most unexpected joys of retirement are regaining a social life , enjoying good health and not having to leave chores and arduous tasks until the weekend			0
some 36 per cent of those aged 71 to 80 said they lived life with a smile on their face , compared to only 16 per cent of 51 - to 60 - year - olds			1
in addition , only 9 per cent of 70 - somethings said they did n’t feel they had a meaningful role to play in their community , compared to 22 per cent of 50 - somethings			2
the findings emerged in a study carried out by @entity1 , the 200 - year - old ‘ friendship group ’ that holds social events and provides support for pensioners , to mark the start of its annual @entity61			1
@entity63 , the society ’s chief executive officer , said : ‘ what our research shows is that it ’s perfectly possible for life to begin at 50 , 60 or even 70			1
they key is how positively you choose to use your time			0
if you approach retirement in the right way then you can become happier as you get older			0
’ she added : ‘ our study shows that the reality of retirement does n’t necessarily meet expectations for a lot of people			1
‘ many simply look forward to having a lot more time on their hands , but that can translate into loneliness , a lack of purpose and a longing for social interaction			0
‘ above all , people often discover they miss the kind of camaraderie and everyday engagement that they took for granted in the course of their working lives			0
’ the study questioned nearly 1,000 over- 50s to gauge their perceptions of retirement and their place within their communities and society			1
nearly half – 45 per cent – of respondents in their fifties said spending time with friends was what they were most looking forward to about being retired			0
yet nearly two - thirds of participants aged in their seventies said they considered it the most enjoyable element			2
having less stress was the aspect of retirement that was both most looked forward to and most enjoyed , selected by more than 60 per cent of those questioned overall			2
some 36 per cent of those aged 71 to 80 said they lived life with a smile on their face compared to only 16 per cent of 51 - to 60 - year - olds the @entity1 helps 280,000 members enjoy a social life , as well as providing care , advice and support			1
throughout september its 146 branches will stage special events to ‘ connect old and new friends ’			0
professor @entity130 of @entity131 , a leading expert on the links between work , stress , friendship and happiness , said yesterday : ‘ there ’s a wealth of research on how people with stressful jobs get a temporary boost in happiness upon retirement , but this boost is n’t sustained by everyone			0
‘ older adults who remain socially active in community and voluntary organisations like the @entity1 are the ones most likely to maintain their happiness in retirement			1
’ the findings are supported by a 2011 study of the health and well - being of pensioners since 1971 , which found that not only are the over- 70s happier , but also better educated and enjoying a more fulfilling sex life than their counterparts 30 years ago			1
professor @entity159 , who led the @entity161 study at @entity162 , said : ‘ this is the rock and roll generation born in the 1930s and 1940s now getting old and they are not going to be sitting on a park bench feeding the birds			2
being 75 today is probably like being 55 was 30 years ago			0
’ older people are smarter than ever too , according to intelligence test scores , due to better schooling			0
researchers suggested that many may be inspired by active and glamorous 70 - somethings such as @entity175 actress @entity174 , 76 , and designer dame @entity176 , 73 .			2
