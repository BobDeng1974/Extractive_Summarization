the governor : @entity0 gov. @entity26 , center , speaks at a news conference in @entity33 , @entity0 after the @entity34 approved a measure to ban capital punishment a repeal bill won final passage from the @entity39 on friday			2
it already had been approved by the @entity41			0
the @entity39 advanced the legislation this week after delegates rejected nearly 20 amendments , mostly from @entity45 , aimed at keeping capital punishment for the most heinous crimes			0
if passed , life without the possibility of parole would be the most severe sentence in the state			0
supporters of repeal argue that the death penalty is costly , error - prone , racially biased and a poor deterrent of crime			1
jubilant : anti-death penalty advocates @entity60 , left , his wife , @entity8 , center , @entity5 , the first @entity8 sentenced to death row who was exonerated by @entity63 the man pictured in today 's jubilant scenes from the @entity0 state capitol is that of 53 - year - old @entity68			1
he was the first @entity8 sentenced to death row who was exonerated by dna fingerprinting			1
an honorably discharged former @entity74 and @entity0 resident , @entity5 was convicted in 1985 of sexual assault , rape , and first - degree premeditated murder for the 1984 rape and murder of a nine - year - old girl in @entity80 , @entity0			1
even though five eyewitnesses had placed him with the victim , he continued to maintain his innocence throughout his trial and subsequent incarceration			0
in 1992 , while in jail , @entity5 read an account of how dna fingerprinting had led to the conviction of @entity90 in the killings of @entity92 and @entity93 ; hoping to prove his innocence , he pushed to have the evidence against him tested by the then - novel method			2
initially , the available evidence in the case — traces of semen in the victim 's underwear — was thought to have been destroyed ; however , when eventually located ( in a paper bag in the judge 's chambers ) , testing proved that the semen did not match @entity108 's dna profile			2
in 1993 , @entity5 was released ; by that time , he had spent almost nine years in prison , two of them on death row			1
though released from prison , @entity5 was not formally exonerated until 2003 when prisoner dna evidence added to state and federal databases identified the real killer : @entity118			1
opponents say it is a necessary tool to punish lawbreakers who commit the most egregious crimes			0
@entity0 has five men on death row			1
the measure would not apply to them retroactively , but the legislation makes clear that the governor can commute their sentences to life in prison without the possibility of parole			0
the state 's last execution took place in 2005 , during the administration of @entity139 gov. @entity139			0
he resumed executions after a moratorium had been in place pending a 2003 @entity145 study , which found significant racial and geographic disparity in how the death penalty was carried out			2
capital punishment was put on hold in @entity0 after a december 2006 ruling by @entity0 's highest court that the state 's lethal injection protocols were n't properly approved by a legislative committee			1
the committee , whose co-chairs oppose capital punishment , has yet to sign off on protocols			0
@entity26 , a @entity161 , expressed support for repeal legislation in 2007 , but it stalled in a @entity41 committee @entity0 has a large @entity161 population , and the church opposes the death penalty			1
in 2008 , lawmakers created a commission to study capital punishment after repeal efforts failed again			0
the panel recommended a ban later that year , citing racial and jurisdictional disparities in how the death penalty is applied			2
in 2009 , lawmakers tightened the law to reduce the chances of an innocent person being sent to death row by restricting capital punishment to murder cases with biological evidence such as @entity63 , videotaped evidence of a murder or a videotaped confession			1
@entity185 to abolish : @entity0 will become the sixth state in as many years to replace capital punishment with life in prison without parole			2
according to the @entity192 website , @entity0 has executed only five inmates since 1976			0
in contrast , neighboring @entity194 has executed 110 inmates since the @entity8 @entity197 restored capital punishment in 1976			0
however , @entity194 's death row population has dwindled to eight from a peak of 57 in 1995 , in part because fewer death sentences are being handed down in the state amid an increased acceptance of life without parole as a reasonable alternative			1
death penalty : @entity0 has five men on death row but the new legislation allows the governor to commute their sentences to life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
@entity218 execution took place in 2005			0
death sentences have declined by 75 percent and executions by 60 percent nationally since the 1990s			0
