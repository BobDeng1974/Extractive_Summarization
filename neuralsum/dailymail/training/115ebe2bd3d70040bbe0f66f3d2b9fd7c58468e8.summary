diamonds may be a girl ’s best friend but , according to the @entity4 , gold can also be a staunch ally if your nest egg is languishing in a low - interest savings account			1
to encourage more ordinary savers to invest in precious metals , the @entity4 has set up a website to simplify the process			2
it estimates that an extra £ 4billion could be invested in gold if the process of buying it or converting it into savings was easier			1
the price of gold , which is valued internationally in @entity19 dollars , soared by around 450 per cent between 2000 and 2011 experts said consumers had been put off because they thought buying precious metals and keeping them secure was too complex			1
they were also worried about finding a reputable dealer or being ripped off			0
buying bullion is also a gamble			0
investors traditionally turn to gold as a haven in times of economic crisis and its value often falls when the going gets good			0
the price of gold , which is valued internationally in @entity19 dollars , soared by around 450 per cent between 2000 and 2011 , rising from £ 168 ( $ 273 ) an ounce to £ 921 ( $ 1,500 )			1
however it has since fallen back to around £ 778 ( $ 1,268 )			0
but the @entity4 said its website would make buying gold and silver as in investment rather than as jewellery ‘ relatively affordable ’			2
the site allows consumers to buy bullion in either gold or silver coins priced according to the fluctuating global rate , plus a premium			2
customers can have the coins delivered to their home , or opt to have them stored in the @entity4 ’s secure storage vault , which is protected around the clock by the @entity52 ( file photo ) diamonds like these may be a girl ’s best friend but gold is where it is at these days ( file photos ) the size of the coins is given in troy ounces , which are slightly heavier than standard ounces and are used for precious metals and gems			1
ordinary investors can buy just a single gold coin , such as the 22 - carat @entity70 , which weighs 0.2354 troy ounces , for around £ 199			1
alternatively , there is the @entity73 , which comes in at around £ 807			0
however , there is no limit to how much bullion people can buy and the @entity4 has set up a special advice and storage service for people spending more than £ 50,000			2

storage fees are charged annually at 1 per cent plus vat of the market value of the gold being held			0
the @entity4 will also buy back customers ’ gold coins that have been stored in its vault			1
no vat is paid on gold bullion coins , and the @entity93 , @entity70 and @entity94 bullion coins are also free of capital gains tax for @entity97 residents because they are legal tender			0
@entity99 , the @entity4 ’s director of commemorative coin , said : ‘ where the average consumer may have shunned gold due to perceived complexities , the @entity4 can help make this option a much more accessible opportunity			2
‘ the quality of our bullion coins is of a standard which can not be rivalled			0
