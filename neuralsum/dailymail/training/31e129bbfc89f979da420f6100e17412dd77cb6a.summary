by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has issued an emphatic response to boss @entity5 ’s criticism by calling on the entire @entity7 team to raise their game in a bid to curve the constructor ’s downward spiral			1
@entity5 took aim at @entity2 last weekend after ordering the @entity14 , who will compete in his 15th @entity16 @entity15 on sunday , to improve on his performances after seeing @entity7 slump to sixth in the championship			1
but @entity2 , seemingly irked by his boss ’s comments , fought back in bullish fashion on the eve of his home race			1
‘ if we want to get back to the front , if we want to win races , then we have got to try harder			1
we are doing an ok job right now			0
we are working hard , but to get back to the front , from the management down , we all have to try harder and get the best out of ourselves so that is hopefully what every one is doing and i definitely am			2
’ @entity5 believed that the form of @entity2 ’s rookie team - mate @entity46 , who has fewer points than the 34 - year - old in the championship , but has achieved the team ’s best result of the season after he finished second at the curtain raiser in @entity55 in march , should provide a ‘ big wake - up call ’			1
‘ in some ways you say , “ great , we ’ve made a great choice with @entity46 ” , but in other ways you say , “ come on @entity2 , you are a @entity59 and one thing you can do on a consistent basis - and you should be doing it - is beating your team - mate , ’ @entity5 , who has returned to @entity7 ’s @entity65 operation after a five - year absence this season , said			1
‘ do i want him to try harder ? of course i do - he ’s a highly - paid grand prix driver			2
’ fighting talk : @entity2 has urged @entity7 to perform better this weekend ‘ for me , the important thing is i have true belief in myself and i am giving it my all , ’ @entity2 remarked when it was put to the 2009 @entity59 if he adjudged the criticism to be unfair			1
‘ believing in yourself and believing in the team , that is the most important thing			0
when i come out of a tough weekend with the team , i sit down with them , we discuss what happened , we more forward and we try and find a way out of it and try and improve ourselves and that is they way we are going to win races			0
that is the way we are going to win races ; all working as one to get better			0
’ after @entity93 crashed out of @entity94 on wednesday , @entity14 ’s torrid @entity96 campaign in @entity97 , and the @entity14 rugby team ’s miserable white - washing in @entity100 , does @entity2 , out of contract at @entity7 at the end of this season , feel a sense of added pressure on himself and countryman @entity103 with 120,000 expectant @entity16 fans descending on @entity28 this weekend ? ‘ i put enough pressure on myself and i feel that @entity103 does as well , ’ @entity2 answered			1
‘ @entity103 has got a good chance of winning			2
i want to be the guy that wins this weekend , but realistically that is not going to happen			0
there is always a miracle that could happen but @entity103 has a really good chance			2
‘ being @entity16 i really hope he does			0
it will be amazing for the @entity16 public and the @entity16 fans , and the atmosphere at @entity28 , so it would be very special			0
i will give him that one , ’ he adds with a smile			0
deep in thought : the upcoming race at @entity28 will be @entity2 's first @entity16 @entity15 since his father @entity121 passed away @entity2 was interviewed at the launch of @entity125 ’s new 123 student @entity123 .			0

@entity2 has hit back at criticism from @entity7 boss @entity5
@entity7 driver has been off the pace of his rivals @entity133 and @entity103
@entity5 stirred the pot by saying @entity2 should be ' trying harder ' in races
