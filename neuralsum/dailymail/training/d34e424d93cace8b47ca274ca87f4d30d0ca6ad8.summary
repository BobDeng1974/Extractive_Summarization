power shift : the poll was commissioned after comments by @entity4 leader @entity3 the majority of @entity6 in favour of remaining part of the @entity9 will be slashed by half if the economic revival leads to a major surge in @entity14 ’s popularity , according to a new poll			1
the boost for @entity18 leader @entity17 comes after a claim that he could use the ‘ hated @entity22 ’ to pull off a surprise victory in the independence referendum			1
the @entity24 has learned that @entity4 leader @entity3 told @entity26 last week that if @entity6 think the @entity22 will win the @entity27 and be in power for ‘ between five and 15 years ’ , they are more likely to vote to quit the @entity9			1
a @entity30 poll in @entity6 for @entity24 provides evidence to back up ms @entity33 ’s argument			1
the majority of 20 per cent in favour of a ‘ no ’ to independence vote falls to 14 if voters believe mr @entity14 will defeat mr @entity26			1
and the gap narrows to just nine if voters believe @entity4 will be out of power for longer			0
the result is a tonic for mr @entity17 , whose supporters have been dismayed by polls showing that as few as one in four @entity6 want to leave the @entity9			2
but the recent upturn in the @entity9 economy , which cut mr @entity26 ’s lead over mr @entity14 to one per cent in one survey , could change that			0
according to @entity30 , if @entity9 ’s economic fortunes and @entity53 ratings continue to rise , it will have an effect on the referendum result in september			2
verdict : the result of the poll on how @entity6 would change their vote for independence if the @entity22 win asked by @entity30 if they intended to vote ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ to quitting the @entity9 , 52 per of @entity6 said ‘ no ’ , with 32 in favour of ‘ yes ’ – broadly in line with recent trends			1
however , when asked how they would vote if they believed mr @entity14 would win in 2015 , the anti-independence majority slips			1
a total of 49 said they would vote ‘ no ’ with 35 in favour of ‘ yes			0
’ and when asked how they would vote if they thought the @entity22 would be in power for up to 15 years , the ‘ no ’ vote goes down to 47 , with the ‘ yes ’ vote catching up on 38			1
the results reflect the deep unpopularity of the conservatives in @entity6			2
they have only one mp in @entity79 compared with 41 @entity80 from @entity6 seats			0
the figures are bound to be seized upon by mr @entity17 to motivate supporters			0
the @entity24 commissioned the survey after learning of the comments by ms @entity33 at a private meeting with mr @entity26 and his @entity87 in @entity88 last week			0
preparing to fly the nest : first minister @entity17 ( right ) talked about whether @entity6 would give up the pound or join the @entity91 when he met with @entity92 governor @entity93 ( left ) on wednesday she begged them to send more @entity96 to @entity6 to tell the public they do not want @entity6 to break away			0
there was a risk of a rise in support for the ‘ yes ’ campaign if @entity6 believed the @entity22 would win the @entity103 , she said			1
a @entity4 insider said : ‘ @entity3 made a very powerful argument			0
she said @entity26 and co have got to get off their backsides and go to @entity6 to join the “ no ” campaign and convince @entity6 they can beat @entity14 in 2015			2
’ the results pose a ‘ @entity112 ’ - style dilemma for mr @entity14			0
if his economic recovery plan stays on course , it will increase his chances of staying in @entity117 – but it could make it harder for him to convince @entity6 not to cut ties with the @entity9 .			0

20 per cent majority saying ' no ' reduces to 14 per cent if @entity22 win in 2015
