there is no bigger celebrity at @entity2 2014 than @entity3 , and on sunday he goes into the jungle hoping to avoid the fate already suffered by both @entity6 and @entity7 - elimination after just two matches			1
at 29 , the @entity9 faces the @entity10 in the @entity11 in @entity12 knowing this is his greatest chance to dominate a finals			2
but his time in @entity2 so far has been a mixture of bizarre sideshows and constant injury concerns			2
when he arrived at the luxurious @entity19 in @entity20 just outside @entity21 11 days ago he was greeted by around 1,000 fans , a man dressed in a @entity25 costume and a topless model			0
the topless welcome to @entity40 ’s base camp had come from @entity71 former ‘ @entity30 ’ , beauty contest winner @entity34 , who has claimed in the past to have had an affair with @entity3 - strenuously denied by the player			1
six days later she was ejected from @entity40 ’s public training session at @entity76 ’s @entity75 stadium and told to stay away from the @entity78 star			1
working hard : @entity3 is put through his paces during @entity40 's training session in northern @entity2 meanwhile , @entity10 coach @entity81 has claimed his players must ' put @entity3 in his place ' if they are to secure qualification from @entity85 ahead of thursday ’s final group game with @entity87			1
speaking to the @entity88 , @entity81 said : ' there ’s a lot of admiration for him and for the players who play at big clubs and in the @entity94 , ' @entity81 said			0
' but this is the moment to prove yourself , to step up , play those guys and put them in their place			0
we want to put @entity3 in his place			0
' we want to make it our game , we are ready for that , and we have been preparing for that for a long time			2
tough task : @entity10 boss @entity81 claims his players must ' put @entity3 in his place ' on sunday evening @entity3 ’s presence in @entity2 has captured the imagination of @entity107 , the third largest city in @entity21 state			1
and waving to the 8,000 supporters packed into the @entity71 second division club ’s ground on wednesday , he seemed to be enjoying the attention			2
but he and his team - mates are less happy about the constant speculation over his fitness			2
asked if the @entity51 players were sick of questions about @entity3 ’s physical condition , striker @entity120 replied : ‘ yes , but if i am tired of hearing the questions every day then you can imagine how it is for him			0
i think the talk is too much			0
he has been training at maximum and that is all there is to say			0
’ cover : @entity3 showed few signs of his knee injury but did wear a small protective bandage over his knee as he prepares to face the @entity10 , the signals remain contradictory			2
‘ @entity3 always finishes the training and then puts ice on his knee but there are normally about 10 players doing the same so it is nothing unusual , ’ said @entity120			0
but while his @entity51 team - mates have lined up this week to repeat the mantra ‘ @entity3 is 100 per cent ’ , @entity51 doctors confirmed before the tournament that he has a problem with his left knee , and it will require rest as soon as the @entity146 ends			1
and for all that @entity120 claims the post-match ice treatment is normal , @entity3 is the only player who walks off the pitch with a sizeable ice - pack already strapped to his knee			0
if @entity40 are knocked out tonight , @entity78 want @entity3 to cut short his @entity146 and begin a prolonged period of rest so that he is ready for next season			1
protection : @entity3 has an ice - pack strapped to his knee during a @entity40 training session on wednesday the @entity159 winner was troubled by an inflamed tendon in the final third of last season and was advised by @entity78 doctors that he should rest as much as possible between then and the end of the campaign or risk missing the @entity146			1
he sat out matches against @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 in @entity170 as well as missing the @entity172 final against @entity173 and the second leg of @entity78 ’s @entity94 quarter - final against @entity176			1
he managed to play in the @entity94 final but club coach @entity178 admitted he did so while being less than 100 per cent			0
he trained again in @entity12 on saturday with a light strapping on his left leg			0
@entity40 coach @entity181 has other injury problems , with striker @entity47 , goalkeeper @entity183 and @entity184 all out and @entity185 missing today ’s game through suspension			1
ball control : @entity3 puts pressure on his knee as he takes on team - mates during a practice match their performance in their opening game against @entity87 did little to shift the attention away from the @entity3 soap opera as a 4 - 0 defeat left @entity87 top of @entity85 and @entity40 bottom			1
the heavy loss has left them needing to win their two remaining games to be sure of progressing beyond the group stages of the @entity146			1
an early exit will be disastrous for @entity3 ’s personal quest to justify the ‘ best player in the world ’ tag he finally earned when he won the @entity159 last january			0
it was his brilliant four - goal salvo against @entity211 in the play - offs that made sure he won the vote ahead of @entity214 and it also meant that he had single - handedly secured @entity40 ’s passage to @entity2			1
after facing the @entity10 in the tropical heat of @entity12 , @entity181 ’s team come up against @entity218 on thursday in @entity219			2
they have not played two games of this importance since that double - header with @entity211 and @entity3 knows keeping @entity40 in the competition beyond the group stage will also help him make it back to the podium for the @entity228 next january			2
‘ when we have these decisive games we always respond			0
i hope that it will be like the @entity211 matches , ’ said @entity120			0
‘ we need to show the same spirit that got us here			0
’ as @entity3 ’s closest ally in the @entity40 camp , he knows better than anyone that what really got @entity40 to @entity2 was @entity3 at his best			1
‘ he is such an important player for us , ’ he said			0
‘ we know he is the one who can really make the difference for us			0
’ peering out : @entity3 looks on before training in @entity107 as @entity40 prepare for their @entity85 match there are times when it seems , much as with @entity6 circa 2002 with @entity245 , that other players in the squad are rather tired of the showbiz baggage that accompanies them because of the global standing of their best player			2
beyond @entity78 pals @entity184 and @entity185 , and @entity120 , who looks set to start up front with him against @entity10 , affection towards @entity3 is never hugely in evidence as @entity40 are put through their paces			1
but his team - mates know they would not be in @entity2 without him and that victory against @entity81 ’s @entity10 team depends largely on whether he can recapture his early - season form and do to the @entity10 what he did to @entity211 in november .			1

@entity78 forward is the centre of attention in @entity2
he *struggled* to impact during the 4 - 0 defeat to @entity87 in @entity40 's opening game
another loss against @entity10 would eliminate them from the @entity146
