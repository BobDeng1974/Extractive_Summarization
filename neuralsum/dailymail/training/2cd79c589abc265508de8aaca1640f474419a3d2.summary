an expert in colour science has hit upon an intriguing idea on why @entity3 painted as he did - and his insights could change the way we view the master 's art. it has long - been rumoured than @entity3 was colour - blind , and this theory is often cited as to why the artist painted with such bold strokes and vibrant , occasionally quirky hues			1
when @entity18 - based @entity17 , giving a speech in @entity15 about vision deficiencies , found himself viewing @entity3 's work in a room illuminated to give the impression of colour - blindness , he found the pieces of art transformed into even better pieces of art. he has now converted @entity3 's work through the lens of colour - blindness - and shared his tool so you can try the experiment with your own choice of pictures - to see if others agree that @entity3 looks better through impaired vision			1
these sequences are as close a rendition as @entity17 has been able to re-create in a tool available to the public stunning : photography from @entity40 shows us a vivid landscape of red and green , as lava flows underneath the @entity45 but the landscape gets lost , with green and reds sapped from the picture : to a colour - blind viewer , some of the spectacular imagery is muted revellers perform on the colourful family day at the @entity54 this @entity55 the same scene , but through the eyes of the colourblind : colours are more muted and changed a purple - grey sky overshadows @entity61 , as storm - clouds rush over @entity63 this week lacking the ability to see red hues , a colour - blind viewer will see a different landscape , with more watered - down colours the fireworks of the closing ceremony of the @entity71 , seen through full vision ... ... and seen again through a colour - blind filter , where the fireworks take on a blue tint before and after : @entity76 runs @entity77 through filter changes to see how the image looks when colour - blind what we are used to seeing : the @entity77 , 1889 , in it 's original , unaltered state improvement ? viewed through a colour - blind lens , the textures and mood alters subtly , the outlines become less harsh , and the colours take on a different hue speaking of his experiences , he said : the ' @entity92 ' used illumination filtered by an optical filter - providing a modified spectrum of light			1
' in this room , the person who has normal color vision sees color the same as the person who has protan or deutan color vision			2
these types of color deficiency mean that certain color combinations are difficult to differentiate			0
' there were prints of @entity3 ’s paintings in the room			2
under the filtered light , i found that these paintings looked different from the @entity3 which i had always seen			2
@entity3 , 1853 -1890 , is one of the most famous artists to have ever lived			0
however he never achieved fame in his lifetime , leaving areas of his life a mystery to us			0
it has been suggested , due to @entity3 's use of colours and occasional drawing of halos around lights , that he suffered wither colour - blindness or a form of intermittent closed angle glaucoma			1
the painter regularly drew coloured halos around light , especially in images painted at night , which occurs with this condition			0
his heavy use of yellows in many painting implies this colour was either a favourite of his - or that he had a colour - blindness that made him use yellow intensely to create his perfect images			1
he added : ' i love @entity3 ’s paintings and have been fortunate to view a number of the originals in various art museums			0
this painter has a somewhat strange way to use color			0
' although the use of color is rich , lines of different colors run concurrently , or a point of different color suddenly appears			2
i ’ve heard it conjectured that @entity3 had color vision deficiency			2
' however , in the @entity3 images seen in the color vision experience room , to me the incongruity of color and roughness of line had quietly disappeared			1
' and each picture had changed into one of brilliance with very delicate lines and shades			1
this was truly wonderful experience			0
' a typical sunset over the @entity174 , in @entity175 , @entity176 ... and the same image as seen through the filet , where both the sky and the fields take on different hues another picture from the @entity184 carnival shows another reveller dressed in an elaborate outfit ... but without colour , some of the impact of the costume is lost , taking an almost monotone style instead @entity17 compares @entity192 ( left : normal vision , right : 60 % protanomal simulation )			1
scroll down for a more in - depth look improving the scene ? the original @entity197 appears here , with the tweaked version below ... the colourblind version : using filters washes out some of the green of the images , perhaps showing the picture as @entity3 intended people with normal colour vision can see the full spectrum - blue , green and red light			1
this is called ' trichromacy '			0
the photo - receptor cells within the eyes ( the ' cones ' ) do the translation work for us , but some people are missing one cone			0
@entity216 , the most common , is lacking red receptors , and is the type emulated in these @entity3 images			0
the others are deuteranopia - a lack of green receptors - and tritanopia , which is the lack of blue receptors			0
he continued : ' one of my friends who has protanomal color vision , a designer and painter , said this to me : '' is n’t it wonderful ? we color deficient people have understood @entity3 ’s true wonderfulness and we have said that he is the genius of geniuses			2
' but color normal people do not understand it well , seemingly			0
' @entity3 was surely color vision deficiency			2
' therefore , color deficient people can better understand his pictures			0
' @entity17 has created the ' @entity245 ' tool , available on pc , @entity247 and @entity248 , which allows normal - sighted people to see images through the eyes of those with one of the three usual colour deficiencies			1
users can upload any image and play with the different filters to see how an approximation of how it looks to someone with colour - blindness			1
@entity3 's self - portrait comes in a different hue when seen originally ( left ) and as a protanomal simulation @entity3 's self portrait , seen originally here ... ... and as it would appear to someone with altered vision the unaltered original , with more freen and more vivid brush - strokes ... closer to @entity3 's vision - or a less accurate portrayal of his @entity271 under @entity272 ?			1

vision expert @entity17 sees @entity3 's work in room where lighting is altered to give effect of colour - blindness
@entity17 *explains* how the ' incongruity of color and roughness had quietly disappeared ... and each picture had changed into one of brilliance with very delicate lines and shades '
creates tool and app which allows anyone to run their own photographs through colour - blindness filter
