by @entity0 for this otter , meal time seems to be the most anticipated part of its day			0
in fact , this hungry animal was so desperate for some food that it sought divine intervention to speed up the process			1
with its hands clasped tightly together and its eyes closed , the otter appears to be deep in prayer shortly before it is given a fishy treat			1
bless this food : an otter clasps his hands together and closes his eyes in the @entity20 animal park in @entity21 before settling down for a fishy treat pictured inside the @entity25 animal park in @entity21 , the cheeky animal could n't hold back his excitement at the thought of some food			1
after noticing the @entity29 pulling the amusing pose , @entity21 photographer , @entity32 , could n't resist catching the moment on camera			1
@entity32 , 36 , said : ' i took the picture shortly before they were due to be fed so they knew that food was coming			2
' they were very excited about it and i noticed that the otter kept making this praying position , it obviously could n't wait for lunch time			0
' it looked to me as if it was whispering its prayers before its meal , so i knew i had to get a photograph			0
' i was laughing a lot when i looked back on the pictures , its head is bowed , its hands are together and its eyes are closed , just like a real prayer			0
' they really are amazing animals , they are cute , social , intelligent and have prehensile hands which they often use to play with little stones			0
' happy : the animal can not contain his excitement as it rolls around on the floor before its meal			2

animal was pictured at the @entity70 animal park in @entity21
seems to be deep in *worship* but is actually awaiting to be fed a treat
