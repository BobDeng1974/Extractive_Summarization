@entity1 manager @entity0 will contest the disrepute charge for criticising referee @entity3 after his team ’s @entity4 draw at @entity6 two weeks ago			1
@entity7 said it was ‘ always the same ’ with referees when bigger teams play against smaller clubs , leading the @entity4 to charge him with implying bias on @entity3 ’s part			1
now it has emerged the @entity1 manager will request a personal hearing with the governing body at which he will explain he was just trying to make a general point			1
@entity0 hopes he wo n't have have the book thrown at him for comments made about referee @entity3 @entity1 take on @entity22 away on sunday and @entity7 said : ‘ i am not angry , i am very disappointed			1
i am now for nearly 30 years a trainer - coach or manager and i have never been charged			1
and still , up to now , i do n’t think that i said something wrong			2
‘ i said already in our press conference ( before the game ) the same phrases , because i know in advance everything is in favour of the underdog			1
‘ i said it before the game and i said it after the game , only in the meaning of the general feeling of everybody , everybody for the underdog			2
‘ so i can not imagine the @entity4 has charged me			1
but , ok , it ’s like that			2
of course i will contest it			0
i never said anything wrong			0
you can confirm , as the media , that i never say anything about the referee , in all the matches			2
’ @entity7 's men were held to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity53 team @entity52 back in january however the @entity54 did not let lightning strike twice and were 3 - 0 winners in the replay at @entity58 @entity7 refused to buy in to former @entity1 manager sir @entity60 ’s theory that the @entity4 used to pick on the club simply because of its standing in the game			1
but it is clear he is irritated			0
@entity1 are , at least , in the next round of the @entity4 , having beaten @entity6 3 - 0 in the replay at @entity58 on tuesday			1
that game featured an impressive cameo appearance from @entity70 @entity69 who has hardly played this season despite being bought for £ 29million in the summer			2
@entity7 said : ‘ he ’s a great guy , he ’s a great professional also , so that ’s not the problem			0
his problem is he has to compete with high - level players			0
@entity78 is the captain so he has a privilege ( of always playing ) — i have explained that — so then the other places ... in this system , for example , that we are playing now , the @entity84 ... that ’s @entity85 , that ’s @entity87			0
‘ that ’s difficult to compete with , but he did already know that at the moment he signed			0
when you sign for a top club , he knows that he has to fight			0
’ former manager sir @entity60 ( left ) was believed @entity1 were treated harshly because of their profile @entity69 ( centre ) has impressed i cameo appearances but faces stiff competition for a starting place @entity98 , meanwhile , has continued to make himself available for selection despite the fact he and his family are living in a hotel following an attempted burglary at their home last weekend			1
‘ he is worried about his wife and child , but i have spoken with him and he wanted to play against @entity52 and i played him , ’ explained @entity7 , who laid a wreath at @entity58 yesterday as an act of remembrance for those who died in the @entity110 on february 6 , 1958			1
‘ i have decided in the past that i will never play a player in those circumstances , because of the total human - being principle			0
but with him , i had the feeling that i had to give him a chance to play			0
and of course , i have to decide again when we face @entity22			0
’ @entity87 is available against @entity22 despite a stressful attempted burglary o his home			0
