by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 13 september 2013 @entity1 , pictured , died last year in prison , but may not have been the only one involved in abusing thousands of young boys police have launched a new investigation into @entity7 ’s worst ever paedophile after an internal report revealed that officers failed to hunt down his sick accomplices			1
millionaire @entity1 was caged for life in 2004 for preying on boys as young as eight over the course of 35 years			1
he was said to have as many as 3,500 victims			2
@entity1 died last year in prison aged 68 , but some of his victims have long suspected there were others involved in his child abuse ring who escaped the net			1
their claims have now been backed by a police probe which said detectives focused so narrowly on @entity26 that they sidelined claims he had help			2
the report by @entity32 ’s @entity31 ( @entity31 ) said hundreds of possible new victims have come forward after his conviction but none had even been interviewed properly			1
the force has responded by promising a full - scale re-investigation that sources say could be bigger than @entity40 - the @entity41 sex abuse investigation			0
@entity1 , who ran a chain of indoor markets and discount stores in @entity45 , @entity46 , used his wealth and influence to lure generations of boys into his clutches			1
he once boasted of abusing 142 children in a single year - and often ten boys at a time stayed in his home			1
he gave them cash and gifts , employed them at his shops , bought homes overlooking school playgrounds and threatened to hurt their mothers if they talked			0
victims have always claimed he had links with other paedophiles and sometimes abused boys with them			2
a police document from 1996 warned that @entity1 ’s abuse ring contained ' prominent members of society ' - but none were ever identified			1
@entity46 and @entity32 launched their internal probe after a complaint was lodged last november by @entity77 , who was abused by @entity1 in his teens and has campaigned for years to see the case reopened			1
the @entity31 referred the case to the @entity81 but insisted the force had correctly followed its policy at the time and did not recommend specific disciplinary action			0
@entity1 abused thousands of boys , and now @entity46 and @entity32 will try to track down his accomplices ( picture posed by model ) however , investigators agreed there was a possibility other victims ' might have also been abused by other offenders and thus the lack of any police action has potentially meant these offenders have retained their liberty and continued their offending behaviour '			1
mr @entity77 , who said victims who came forward were simply given a crime number and referred to support services , welcomed the new inquiry			0
he said : ' of the 17 witnesses who originally were part of the trial which led to @entity1 ’s eventual conviction , some had named other paedophiles connected to @entity1 who had also abused them			2
this information eventually led to the convictions of other paedophiles in the last few years			0
' what if these other hundreds of victims , that came forward but were never allowed to make statements , were abused by others as well ? ' they were just given crime reference numbers and a telephone helpline to ring			0
it means their offenders have been active in @entity45 for all this time without ever being brought to book			0
' mr @entity77 was backed by former detective constable @entity126 , who helped secure @entity1 ’s life sentence in 2004			1
she said : ' the interviews and statements showed there were more victims and more offenders out there			0
a senior officer said to my boss " put a lid on it and concentrate on @entity26 "			0
' @entity46 and @entity32 said it had assembled a team of specially - trained officers for a ' complex and sensitive investigation '			0
detective sergeant @entity142 said : ' the issues raised by mr @entity77 were investigated by the @entity31			0
their investigation concluded that police had acted lawfully and proportionately and that no misconduct issues had been identified			2
' a voluntary referral , however , was made to the @entity81 in respect to some of the key policy decisions that had been made during the police investigations into the criminal activities of mr @entity1			1
' following consultation with the @entity81 commissioner , @entity155 , deputy chief constable @entity156 has asked for the @entity46 and @entity157 to draw up a terms of reference for a new police investigation which will seek to address the conclusions highlighted within the @entity31 investigation			0

@entity1 was *jailed* for life after four decades of abusing boys
he died last year aged 68 , but victims say he was not the only abuser
official report concluded that investigators could have done more
now police launch a fresh search for other *peadophiles* in the case
