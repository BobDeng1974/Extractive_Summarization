two centuries might separate their great seafaring triumphs , and in terms of speed and agility , the vessels they commanded may well be beyond all compare			0
yet given the way sir @entity9 almost single - handedly inspired his bedraggled and outclassed team to victory in the world ’s oldest and most prestigious yacht race on wednesday , experts were pondering a rather unlikely question : is he the greatest @entity15 sailor since @entity16 ? it might sound somewhat far - fetched , but for those who were n’t fortunate enough to witness on tv what is being hailed as the greatest sporting comeback of all time , the facts are these			1
thrilled : sir @entity9 triumphantly holds up the @entity25 trophy after the @entity26 won the sailing race in @entity28 on thursday @entity26 : ( from left to right ) tactician @entity29 , skipper @entity30 , @entity32 ceo @entity31 and helmsman sir @entity9 stand with the @entity25 trophy having invested a cool £ 120 million of his fortune in attempting to retain the @entity25 , billionaire computer tycoon @entity31 had watched forlornly as his turbo - charged super-boat , crewed by an elite team of 11 international yachtsmen hired on megabucks salaries , were blown out of the water by their @entity41 opponents			1
@entity31 ’s @entity26 lost race after race in the series , and by mid-september their humiliation was almost complete			1
having won eight of the nine completed races , their challengers , @entity47 ( whose budget was less than half of @entity32 ’s ) , needed to clinch just one more victory to claim the coveted 162 - year - old cup in front of more than a million spectators in @entity58			2
it seemed a mere formality			0
speed machine : the @entity32 catamaran , which boasts carbon - fibre sails designed by a @entity65 engineer , has a hull length the same size as two @entity69 buses and the same width as a three - lane motorway but then something quite extraordinary happened			0
something which surpasses perhaps even @entity75 ’s legendary match - winning innings to snatch victory for @entity77 in the @entity78 at @entity79			2
in desperation , @entity31 sacked his tactician , an acclaimed yacht - racing genius named @entity83 , who had made a series of errors , and replaced him with @entity86 , who had been included in @entity32 ’s team only to sail their trial boats , and — having won four olympic gold medals in a very different form of sailing — was not considered experienced enough to play a major part in the @entity25			1
it must be said that mega-rich @entity94 also spent millions more on redesigning his yacht ’s aerodynamics — reputedly seeking advice from top technicians at aircraft giant @entity65 — yet it was undoubtedly the dramatic intervention of the bearded 36 - year - old @entity101 mariner that turned the tide			0
billionaire backing : the @entity32 was bankrolled by software tycoon @entity31 , who ploughed a staggering £ 120million into his @entity25 campaign			1
the catamaran itself cost £ 7million drafted in with @entity32 still five points down , he set about assessing every aspect of his boat ’s performance , digesting data from a computer worn on his wrist			0
he also excelled in his key role of studying the opposition and drawing up an effective attack plan in a split - second ; but such is his innate seafaring brilliance that the high - powered engineers also consulted @entity86 — who learned to sail at his father ’s side in a dinghy bobbing about in the channel when he was eight years old — about the key design modifications			0
@entity32 won one race , then another			0
and another ; and on wednesday when they glided past the @entity127 to thrash a desperate and disbelieving @entity41 crew by 44 seconds , @entity86 was given the honour of taking the wheel to steer the victorious yacht back to its moorings			1
all along the shoreline , the @entity134 fluttered , for officially this was another great @entity138 victory			2
in truth , however , nobody among the joyous crowd was in any doubt that it was a triumph for @entity15			1
‘ @entity9 did n’t do it all his own , it was a great team effort , but he really changed the course of the race series , ’ said @entity143 , author of the definitive book on @entity25 history , who watched the thrilling spectacle unfold			1
comparison : sir @entity9 has been hailed as @entity15 's greatest sailing hero since @entity155 captain lord @entity16 ‘ there is no doubt he is the best sailor we have ever had in @entity15 , and though one was a great battle commander and the other a great sportsman , i actually think it ’s quite fair to compare him with @entity16 , because both were tactically brilliant and their skills transcend the centuries , even given the huge changes in technology			1
‘ @entity16 used his skill and cunning to split the @entity171 fleet at @entity172 by sailing at them at right - angles , rather than sailing alongside them ( the conventional way of doing battle in those days )			2
‘ @entity9 has been sailing since he was a kid and he ’s absorbed so much knowledge			2
he has become a master at reading the wind and knowing the currents			0
they were skills he used to great effect in helping @entity32 to pull off this amazing comeback , and @entity15 should be very proud of him			2
’ indeed we should , but @entity86 himself says he wo n’t be satisfied until he brings the @entity25 to @entity15 , which staged the inaugural race against the @entity138 schooner @entity188 , after which the contest is named , off the @entity191 in 1851			1
yet , despite many glorious — and highly expensive — tilts , we have never yet managed to win it			0
despite all the millions it would take to mount a credible challenge , the remarkable events of this week have brought the dream closer			0
for the world ’s top crewmen will surely now clamour to sail in a yacht guided by the great @entity201 — who recently acquired the requisitely wealthy sponsor , bankers @entity204			0
given a following wind , therefore , we might soon see sir @entity9 steering his victorious course along the @entity208			1
why , perhaps , in years to come , he ’ll even be on a plinth in @entity210 .			0

sir @entity9 led the @entity26 to beat @entity41 at the @entity25 *decider* in @entity28
the olympian is hailed as the greatest sailor since lord @entity16 following one of sport 's greatest comebacks
he now wants to lead a @entity15 team to victory in the world 's oldest international sporting competition
