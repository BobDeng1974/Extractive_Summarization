@entity0 did it under @entity2 ; sir @entity5 ’s @entity4 side did it ; @entity7 under @entity8 do it			0
many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years			0
it ’s a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity			0
so when @entity18 surrounded referee @entity19 to get @entity17 sent off on wednesday it was n’t something new , or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us			1
it has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game			2
it ’s been a part of @entity32 football for years			1
having said that , now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way , as i believe @entity18 did on wednesday and i think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules			1
almost all the @entity18 squad surrounded referee @entity19 after an incident at @entity43 if a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way			1
so on wednesday night , he could still have sent off @entity17 if he really felt it was a red card offence but @entity18 would have lost the advantage of a free kick			1
it would n’t immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction			0
behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players			2
at the moment , it ’s worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision , so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so			1
however , if you felt that by hounding the referee , your team might lose a potential goal - scoring opportunity , because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box , managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint			1
and over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly			0
imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee			1
the manager would be furious			0
@entity19 might have looked at the @entity17 tackle and thought it was a 50 - 50 decision			1
but when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too , all of that activity around him might make him feel it ’s a 90 per cent decision			2
this tackle from @entity97 striker @entity17 sparked a furious reaction from @entity18 players the @entity18 players surround referee @entity19 at @entity43 as he brandishes the red card @entity18 captain @entity101 ( left ) reacts after @entity17 's tackle on @entity102 in the first - half this would only be a small change in the rules but i believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time			1
certainly managers would n’t encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team			2
it gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive			2
you could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card , trying to get an opponent booked or sent off			0
that would soon end what is an unsavoury practice			0
another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner , forcing the referee to back off			2
it ’s natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high			2
but what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players wo n’t encroach			2
if someone is to complain , they can do so backing away from the referee , getting into position , not moving towards him			2
and if someone does need to go to referee , it should only be the captain			2
and when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee			2
@entity101 ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following @entity17 's first - half challenge football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle			1
i ’ve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it ’s directed in the right way			0
but referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct			0
it ’s important to draw a line and clearly state what is and is n’t acceptable			0
when @entity176 , @entity32 teams can feel benefit in europe it has been an awful few weeks for @entity32 teams in @entity181 with only @entity182 thriving in the @entity183			1
given the competitiveness of the @entity186 you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the @entity190 and @entity183 , when the competitions step up a level			1
but the reverse seems to happening			0
the sheer competitiveness of the @entity186 is leaving us short in these difficult games			1
not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title , which is not the case in most of @entity181 ’s other major leagues , but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games			1
@entity182 are progressing well in the @entity183 as other @entity32 sides continue to struggle in @entity181 having played in @entity207 , i know that for @entity97 , @entity209 and @entity210 there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best			1
it ’s not that it ’s easy but going to the smaller @entity207 teams is not like going to @entity217 to play @entity218 or @entity219 to play @entity220 , where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over @entity18 or @entity4			1
that ’s not the case in @entity207 , and i ’m not sure it is in @entity229 or @entity230			0
obviously @entity231 are utterly dominant in @entity232 at the moment , so there are n’t that many games where they need to be at the top level			0
do n’t forget that while our teams were playing five games in two weeks over @entity240 , @entity231 , @entity241 and @entity242 were on a 40 - day break			2
@entity244 endured a torrid @entity190 3 - 0 defeat against @entity246 late last month and while the @entity240 break is n’t as long in @entity207 , @entity229 and @entity230 , it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun. it ’s ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the @entity186 , which is what has made it so successful , might now be damaging our performance in @entity181 and by extension damaging it ’s reputation			1
however , there is an opportunity now to help @entity32 team in the @entity190			1
@entity263 has long drawn attention to @entity230 teams playing games on a friday night if they have a tuesday night champions league game			1
the new £ 5.1billion tv deal — a mark of how popular the @entity186 is — has provision for some friday night games			1
the @entity186 and tv companies should be looking at those friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the @entity190			1
we need to give our teams every chance we can			0
after all , if @entity186 clubs consistently fail in @entity181 , global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are			1
@entity282 manager @entity281 ' side crashed of the @entity183 to @entity283 in late february great to look back at my career i was really honoured a few months ago when @entity286 asked if i would be the subject of a documentary covering my life in football			0
the result will be shown tonight on @entity286 and it ’s been a trip down memory lane for me and a chance to reflect on my career			0
there are one or two things i had n’t remembered , like the post-match interview i did after scoring on my league debut as an 18 - year - old against @entity304 in 1976			0
the collars on the shirt i was wearing — oh my word ! they look like something @entity310 might have turned down as excessive			0
@entity311 volleys in for @entity312 against @entity4 in 1979 , his favourite goal he scored and i ’m pleased to say my @entity315 appearance singing @entity316 gets an outing — not that any of the musicians will be			0
it also gave me a chance to take another look at my favourite goal , the volley i scored for @entity312 against @entity4 from just inside the box in 1979			0
i ’ve never taken drugs in my life but the feeling i had that day , with the adrenalin pumping through my body after scoring , is how i imagine it feels			0
i hope people enjoy watching the film as much as i did making it			0
@entity311 : a @entity333 , @entity286 1 , 7pm			0

@entity18 players surrounded referee @entity19 to get @entity97 striker @entity17 sent off on wednesday in their @entity190 clash
the @entity338 were *heavily* *criticised* for such actions
@entity186 games on a friday could help @entity32 teams in @entity181
