the 4,000 - year - old @entity8 statue had curators at @entity10 puzzled after it began to mysteriously rotate overnight , despite being housed in a secure glass case			1
@entity13 is a 10in ( 25cm ) statuette made in about 1800 bc as a medium for the soul of an ancient @entity8 man			1
the mystery of the ' rotating ' statue has been solved following a scientific investigation which showed it moved as a result of vibrations from passing footfall and traffic @entity13 is a 10in statuette made in about 1800 @entity24 as a medium for the soul of an ancient @entity8 man explanations for its movement ranged from mystical and magical ancient myths , curses and spirits to the object being possessed			1
but , following an investigation , a far more 21st century reason has been unearthed - that the figure rotated as a result of vibrations from passing footfall and traffic			1
@entity41 's @entity40 , which investigates myths and mysterious stories , enlisted specialists to place sensors under the cabinet to detect vibrations , which dispelled some of the more outlandish claims			2
vibration expert @entity50 undertook a 24 - hour test by placing a specialist three - axis sensor under the wall - mounted cabinet containing the relic , to record any vibrations present			2
vibration expert @entity50 undertook a 24 - hour test by placing a specialist three - axis sensor under the wall - mounted cabinet containing the relic figuring it out : @entity50 said the vibration comes from a combination of multiple sources beginning the test at 6pm , he found there was a peak in vibration level which correlated with movement at this time			0
overnight the vibrations stopped and the statue stopped rotating			2
movement began again at 7am the following day - at the same time the vibrations also started again			1
mr @entity50 said : ' the vibration is a combination of multiple sources so there 's buses outside on the busy road , there 's footfall activity			0
and it 's all of those things combined			0
' when asked why other displays were not rotating , he added : ' this statue has a convex base			0
there 's a lump at the bottom which makes it more susceptible to vibrations than the others which have a flat base			0
' @entity95 , an @entity96 curator , previously attributed the mysterious movement to ' a force beyond the physical ' whilst @entity100 , a student , ascribed the motion to magic			0
professor @entity103 previously said he thought the movement was a result of friction between the carved serpentine figure and the glass shelf			1
: : @entity40 is presented by @entity109 and @entity110 and is on @entity41 at 8pm today .			0

@entity113 statuette began to mysteriously rotate overnight
was housed in a secure glass case in @entity10
explanations for its movement ranged from ancient myths to curses
