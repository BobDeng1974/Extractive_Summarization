by @entity0 for the @entity1 smitten : @entity2 is at the centre of a love triangle after she ' fell for ' opera singer @entity6 's ' charm offensive ' what a delightful operatic libretto it would make : a story of star - crossed lovers , with a hint of farce			1
a beautiful young harpist with golden hair , who plays in royal palaces across the land , entrances two men			2
one is older , rich and famous , a big hulk of a man ; the other is young and fresh - faced and on the cusp of greatness			2
the beautiful harpist marries the younger man , but realises it is the hulk of a man she really loves			0
the young woman and her older suitor run off together and are christened by those who have observed the unfolding drama ‘ @entity35 ’			2
throw in a prince and a few hummable arias and it all has the makings of cracking entertainment			0
but this story has happened in real life			0
@entity6 , the phenomenally successful 48 - year - old @entity44 bass baritone , is wildly in love with 27 - year - old @entity2 , official harpist to the @entity46			1
she has walked out on her husband of just two years , @entity48 , an up - and - coming @entity44 baritone			1
to add to 31 - year - old mr @entity48 ’s pain , he has frequently been described as ‘ the next @entity6 ’			1
in an interview in june 2012 , a month before his nuptials with @entity53 , mr @entity48 talked about the similarities between himself and @entity6			1
‘ whenever someone makes a comparison between me and @entity6 , i think it ’s incredibly flattering , ’ he said			1
‘ i spoke to him after i won the @entity59 [ an award given by the @entity61 , which @entity6 won 20 years earlier ] and he was extremely supportive			1
he ’s such an incredible artist , but in many ways we are quite different as he ’s a bass baritone and i ’m a baritone			0
he ’s such a busy guy and he finds the time to support so many young singers			2
so just how was the lovely @entity2 enticed away from the next @entity6 into the arms of the actual @entity6 ? according to a well - placed source within the classical music world , @entity6 launched a charm onslaught so intense that eventually @entity2 could do nothing but capitulate			1
she had married mr @entity48 in a romantic ceremony on @entity76 in @entity77 in july 2012 and they had settled together at a property at @entity80			1
@entity2 , who was brought up in @entity81 , had come to prominence in 2011 when she landed the coveted role of official harpist to the @entity46			2
she made her debut in the summer of that year at a charity reception at @entity89 ’s @entity88 estate in @entity77 , and said just beforehand : ‘ i ’m a little bit nervous , but i ’m excited , too			0
i auditioned about five weeks ago , then i got a phone call from his [ the @entity46 ’s ] secretary and an official letter			0
i could n’t believe it			0
‘ i ’ve played the harp since i was eight and ever since i knew about this role it ’s been my dream			0
’ with the role comes prestige — but not a great deal of money			0
it is an unpaid position , for which @entity2 receives around £ 3,000 in expenses a year			1
rivals : @entity44 bass baritone @entity6 , 48 , pictured left , and @entity2 's husband @entity48 , an up - and - coming @entity44 baritone , pictured right , whom she married in 2012 she is also part of the @entity108 with two other glamorous female performers , @entity110 on the flute and @entity112 on viola			1
@entity6 and @entity2 had known each other for some time , after repeatedly appearing at the same classical events			1
it is possible that @entity6 was bewitched by the pretty blonde at first sight , but managed to keep his feelings to himself until his own marriage had broken down			2
he had married his childhood sweetheart , @entity122 , in 1987 , and the couple went on to have three children			1
but last year it was revealed that the marriage had collapsed at the end of 2012 , after @entity122 reportedly fell for a local man called @entity129 , who lived on a council estate a mile down the road from the couple ’s white - walled mansion outside @entity134 , @entity135			1
meanwhile , @entity2 seemed happy enough with @entity48 , posting this tweet in october last year : ‘ really enjoyed @entity138 ’s @entity137 ! ! me and @ @entity48 chuckled all the way through it ! ’ but the laughing stopped soon after that , it seems			1
two months later , just before @entity144 , @entity6 and @entity2 were thrown together to record the story of the @entity146 for a @entity144 special for the @entity149 channel , @entity148			1
@entity6 was clearly captivated by the beautiful young musician and posted this tweet during recording : ‘ @entity2 , our beautiful royal harpist , getting ready for her solo			1
’ ‘ in fact , @entity6 swept her off her feet			2
he has a huge presence , a big personality			0
he pursued her , he paid her a great deal of attention			0
eventually she capitulated ' a friend of @entity2 at the outset , those around him thought that poor lovelorn @entity6 would have no chance with a relatively newly - married woman 20 years his junior			1
‘ the thing is , @entity2 was perfectly happy with @entity48 , ’ said a friend of @entity2 ’s			1
‘ it was n’t as though she ’d become disillusioned with marriage — well , there was n’t really time for that			0
‘ it was clear @entity2 was being friendly towards @entity6 , but most of us thought she was leading him down the garden path			1
‘ in fact , @entity6 swept her off her feet			2
he has a huge presence , a big personality			0
he pursued her , he paid her a great deal of attention			0
’ the romance was revealed last weekend , but may have been going on for some time			2
in the classical music world , it has been an open secret			1
last month , @entity6 watched @entity2 perform with @entity108 at the @entity192			1
afterwards , he helped her load her harp in her car and then they left together			0
when it was suggested to ms @entity2 ’s booking agent , @entity198 , that they were not making a secret of the affair , she said : ‘ yes , i have spent an afternoon with them			2
@entity6 was not playing at the concert , but he came along to it			2
’ @entity207 manager @entity206 said : ‘ it ’s not any great secret in music circles that they are a couple			0
’ @entity6 and @entity2 are represented by the same musical agency , @entity213			1
their agent , @entity214 , confirmed to the @entity1 that they are on holiday together in @entity217 this week			0
‘ they see themselves as soulmates , ’ says a friend			0
‘ they share the same taste in everything — film , music , food			0
they are in love , very happy and see a long - term future together			0
the 27 - year - old harpist , pictured with patron @entity89			1
it is not known whether divorce proceedings between @entity2 and her husband are underway ‘ @entity2 is very sensitive , of course , about how this has been perceived			2
she is keen not to be seen in a bad light			0
‘ they both see it as one of those things — a great love , nothing could be done about that			0
she says they were powerless			0
they make a striking pair and everyone calls them @entity35			0
’ how their respective spouses feel about this ‘ great love ’ is another matter			0
@entity6 and @entity122 were married for 25 years , during which time she focused on raising their children as her talented husband ’s star rose			1
the bass baritone played numerous major roles in operas such as @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity259 operas			0
soon the farmer ’s son and his wife were living in that mansion outside @entity134 , overlooking the @entity265 mountains in one direction and the sea nearby to the west			0
the collapse of the marriage and @entity122 ’s affair with @entity129 , who works in a local supermarket and is known as ‘ chops ’ to his friends , came as a shock to their friends			2
out at a nightclub one night , mr @entity129 was reportedly attacked by two men — one wielding a glass or bottle — in the early hours as he drank and chatted with mrs @entity6 at the bar			2
as he was being consoled by door staff , mr @entity129 told them he was ‘ in a relationship ’ with mrs @entity6 , adding , as they tended to his injuries , that she was likely to receive an £ 8 million divorce settlement			2
the @entity289 are currently going through the painful process of unravelling their finances as part of the divorce			0
@entity6 ’s company , @entity295 , which posted profits of £ 545,172 on its last accounts and appears to be co-run with @entity122 , went into voluntary liquidation after the couple split			1
at the last accounts , @entity122 and @entity6 paid themselves £ 70,500 each in dividends			1
whatever financial settlement @entity122 emerges with , it seems that mr @entity129 will not be sharing in her riches — for the @entity1 can reveal that @entity122 ’s relationship with @entity129 has broken down			2
his mother confirmed to the @entity1 this week that the couple are no longer together			0
@entity122 has remained at the family home in @entity134 , while @entity6 is living at his flat in @entity310 , which is currently being renovated			1
@entity48 , meanwhile , was ‘ bereft ’ when @entity2 left him , friends say			1
it is not known if divorce proceedings are under way			0
what , then , will be the final act in this fast - paced libretto ? will the star - crossed lovers marry , once they have extricated themselves from their current spouses ? only one thing seems certain			0
@entity48 , it ’s fair to say , will never wish to be referred to as ‘ the next @entity6 ’ ever again .			1
