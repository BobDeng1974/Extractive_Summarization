@entity9 is being judged in absentia for the 2007 murder of the @entity13 student as she has now returned to the @entity14 prosecutors at the trial also requested that her ex-boyfriend @entity17 be given 26 years , saying the punishment should be harsher for @entity9 because she initially accused someone else of the crime			1
@entity3 's ( right ) retrial for the murder of former housemate @entity7 ( left ) has been done in absentia as she returned to the @entity14 @entity8 prosecutors have called for a 26 - year jail sentence for @entity17 , right , and 30 years for @entity9 @entity9 and @entity17 have already served four years in prison for the murder of @entity28 , who was found half - naked in a pool of blood on november 2 , 2007 in the house she shared with @entity9			1
the pair , who have always protested their innocence , were acquitted on appeal in 2011 but the supreme court earlier this year overturned that ruling , sending the case back to the appeals stage at a court in @entity41			2
the retrial is expected to reach a verdict in january			0
@entity9 is now back in the @entity14 and experts say it is highly unlikely that she could ever be extradited even if she is convicted and even if that conviction is upheld in another appeal to the supreme court			1
@entity7 , a local petty thief and drug dealer , has been convicted separately and is serving a 16 - year sentence for the gruesome murder which shocked the university town of @entity55 and has divided opinions			1
prosecutor @entity57 told the court today that the dna evidence , which is highly disputed in the case , showed that @entity17 and @entity9 had stabbed @entity28 while @entity61 sexually assaulted her			1
prosecutor @entity57 told @entity41 's @entity62 that dna evidence found on a kitchen knife prove @entity17 and @entity9 stabbed miss @entity28 to death @entity57 said he believed @entity9 had used a large kitchen knife that was later found by investigators in @entity17 's home , pointing to faint dna traces of @entity28 found on the blade and of @entity9 on the handle			1
he said the sexual element became ' marginal ' as the drug - fuelled violence increased			0
' they were trying to get rid of someone who had to be shut up , ' @entity57 said			0
@entity9 during one interrogation accused @entity7 , the owner of a bar where she worked as a waitress , of being in the house at the time of the murder			2
but @entity57 said a phone wiretap had overheard @entity9 telling her mother that @entity87 was not there			0
' what gave her the certainty if not the fact that she was there ? ' @entity57 asked , saying that the young woman 's version of what happened had ' little credibility '			0
@entity7 was killed at this house in @entity55 , @entity8 , in november 2007 @entity57 said @entity9 claimed she had returned to the house after sleeping at @entity17 's when @entity28 was already dead but claimed she had not noticed anything and even showered in a bathroom dirty with @entity28 's blood			1
he also said @entity9 's initial and later retracted statement to police that she had heard ' a scream and violence ' in the house ' contained elements of truth '			2
' where do these elements come from if not having been directly involved in the incident ? ' he said			0
@entity57 also said that @entity17 's claim that he spent most of the evening at home on his computer was not backed up by analysis of the computer			0
criticising the previous appeals court ruling that acquitted @entity9 and @entity17 , @entity57 said it had made the mistake of ' isolating ' individual pieces of evidence without looking at the full picture			2
the supreme court had ' wiped out ' that ruling , he said .			0
