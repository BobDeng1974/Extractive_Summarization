updated : 08:45 gmt , 6 december 2011 it will cost £ 6,750,000 per hour to stage the opening and closing ceremonies for the @entity3 and @entity4			1
the astonishing figure emerged last night as a spending watchdog warned that the security bill for next year ’s extravaganza has smashed through the £ 1billion barrier			1
the total cost of starting and finishing the sports jamboree will be £ 81million , including £ 41million of taxpayers ’ money			2
ouch ! the @entity3 opening and closing ceremonies are set to cost £ 7m - an - hour ... and security costs will exceed £ 1billion each of the four ceremonies at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , will last approximately three hours , meaning they will cost £ 112,500 per minute			1
the @entity22 warned that ministers are in danger of overshooting the £ 9.3billion budget for next year ’s games			2
the @entity27 has agreed to pay £ 41million towards the opening and closing ceremonies – a bill that was supposed to be entirely footed by @entity31 , the @entity4 ’s privately - funded organising committee			1
the £ 41million of public money will double the budget for the opening and closing ceremonies to more than £ 80million			2
although @entity31 has never revealed it initial budget , it was understood to be about £ 40million			2
clock is ticking : the @entity40 get underway on july 27 next year - and the opening and closing ceremonies will now cost public £ 81m olympics minister @entity43 : ' we decided to go in at the higher figure for the benefit of the country ' the amount of money needed to ensure the safety of spectators , athletes and officials at the @entity40 has almost doubled after the number of security guards required was wildly underestimated			1
around 23,700 security staff – including 7,000 off - duty soldiers – will be deployed next summer , compared with the original estimate of 10,000			1
the security bill is growing because £ 271million has been added to the £ 282million already pledged			1
on top of this , £ 475million has been set aside for policing and wider security , meaning the total cost for keeping athletes , spectators and dignitaries safe during the competition is now £ 1.03billion			1
according to the government ’s own predictions , it will need to use £ 318million of the £ 354million contingency fund that still remains			2
that will leave only £ 36million to play with			2
last night the @entity22 , the @entity74 spending watchdog , warned that ministers must take ‘ rigorous action ’ to curb spending and said there was a ‘ real risk ’ the overall budget of £ 9.3billion could be exceeded			0
in 2005 , when @entity21 won the bid to host the 2012 @entity3 and @entity4 , the total cost was estimated at £ 2.37billion			1
by 2007 , this figure had quadrupled to the present total			0
in a report @entity85 , head of the @entity22 , warns : ‘ not everything is rosy			0
the government is confident that there is money available to meet known risks , but in my view , the likelihood that the @entity4 can still be funded within the existing £ 9.3billion public sector funding package is so finely balanced that there is a real risk more money will be needed			1
’ officials insist the £ 9.3billion budget will not be exceeded as the extra costs will be funded through savings made elsewhere on olympic 2012 spending			1
the @entity27 said the @entity103 showed the @entity4 were still on track to stay within budget			1
with eight months to go before the @entity4 , the @entity22 has warned that a contingency of only £ 36million is ‘ not a lot of headroom ’ , considering that the security budget alone has doubled since february			1
strength in numbers : there will now be 23,700 security officers on duty at the @entity4 next summer the £ 1billion plus security bill does not even include the £ 253million to secure the @entity3 venues during the construction phase			1
the @entity117 is now in negotiations with the @entity119 to provide up to 7,000 off - duty soldiers to plug the recruitment shortfall for guards			0
the government has denied it is in response to a specific security threat but simply a further analysis of numbers			0
olympics minister @entity43 defended the extra spending and said @entity21 needed to advertise itself to the world next year			0
‘ these ceremonies will be aired around the globe and watched by four billion people , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a seminal moment for @entity135 and we wanted to give it the wow factor and leave a lasting economic legacy			0
‘ we can not do “ a @entity140 ” but we want to give this our best shot to encourage people from around the world to come and visit			0
’ past measures : anti-aircraft missiles were ready for the @entity146 @entity148 pressure group criticised the decision to put more public money towards the ceremonies			0
director @entity152 said : ‘ taxpayers might enjoy watching the opening party for the @entity40 but they wo n’t want to wake up to the hangover of another £ 40million on the bill			2
’ last night , @entity157 , chairman of the @entity158 , said the contingency fund was a very small amount for such a large project			0
‘ what is left in the budget for contingency is wafer thin , at only £ 36million , ’ she said			0
‘ for a project of this size with unknown risks and eight months remaining , that is a tiny amount of money			0
‘ @entity31 is likely to use all of its contingency funding and would also have to call on further @entity123 support if there are further cost increases			0

extra £ 271m added to venue security bill , now at £ 553m
policing costs set at £ 475m
23,700 security staff at @entity4 instead of 10,000
