on our drive from @entity44 's airport , a young mother selling fruit advised us to be careful as we traveled ahead , ' miss @entity18 told @entity22			1
' but here we were , feeling informed with our guidebooks in hand , stubbornly optimistic for our beach vacation and myself , anyway , overly adventurous from a lifetime of travel " off the beaten path "			2
' although she admits that the view was amazing , their villa was dirty and full of bugs , and the couple had reservations about its location as soon as they arrived			2
miss @entity18 , who is also a writer , said they discussed moving straight away but , because they had paid a non-refundable deposit and it was getting late , they decided to wait until morning			1

as the teacher screamed , the man swung the machete at her while grabbing her breast			0
' i do n't remember well what happened then , ' @entity98 , who was left needing therapy			0
' there 's no visual memory anymore , only the memory of that scream , mine eventually joined by his , this man who had been seconds away from slitting my boyfriend 's throat a few minutes before			0
' she added that the attacker had been to their villa earlier in the day , on the pretense of selling fruit to them			1
he had then hidden in the bushes for night to fall			0

but their ordeal was far from over			0
