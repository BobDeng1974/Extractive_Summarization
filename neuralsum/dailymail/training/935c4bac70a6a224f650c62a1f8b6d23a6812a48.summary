security officials made a string of blunders in tracking the fanatics who butchered @entity4 , an official report said yesterday			0
agents dismissed @entity7 as a drug dealer who was not a threat to national security weeks before the merciless killing outside @entity13 barracks in @entity14 in may 2013			1
by that time , @entity7 and his accomplice @entity15 had featured in seven @entity17 investigations			1
following a series of errors , including paperwork delays , neither of the @entity23 converts was under intrusive surveillance at the time of the murder			1
agents dismissed @entity7 as a drug dealer who was n't a threat to national security weeks before the killing outside @entity13 barracks in @entity14 officers from the security service had closed their operation against @entity7 on april 11 , 2013 – just six weeks before the atrocity – and suggested police should instead arrest him for drugs			1
incredibly , however , the @entity41 lost the number of his house so no further action was taken			0
the unnamed officer in @entity47 who took the decision said his address would be too hard to find			0
the log reads : ‘ closed … can not find number … and this is a long road			0
’ in the case of @entity15 , he first came to the attention of @entity17 in august 2011 after studying hate - filled extremist material on the internet			1
however , it took eight months for officials to start investigating him – three months to find his name , followed by five months of ‘ inaction ’			0
murdered : @entity62 soldier @entity4 , of @entity63			0
@entity7 and @entity15 were found guilty in december 2013 of murdering @entity4 , despite @entity7 's claims that he was a ' soldier of @entity65 ' and that the killing was an act of war in its report , the @entity69 said there was no excuse for the delay , though it conceded it did not have an impact on the final outcome			1
there were similar delays in mounting more detailed surveillance after the security services received intelligence in march 2013 that @entity15 was handing out extremist material			1
it took more than a month to complete the paperwork , which was sent backwards and forwards between @entity17 lawyers and staff – only being completed one day before the killing			2
@entity87 , the home secretary , was finally able to sign the warrant as an ‘ urgent application ’ only in the hours after @entity90 had been butchered			0
the 191 - page report contains a string of redactions – but glosses over the attempts made by @entity17 to recruit @entity7 as an informant			2
yesterday , @entity96 said there were ‘ lessons to be learned ’			0
@entity7 and @entity15 speaking to a member of the public near the murder site he told @entity102 that £ 130million would be invested into the security services to help identify lone wolf terrorists			1
the @entity105 , which had access to hundreds of pages of secret intelligence , identified at least four missed opportunities to uncover more evidence about the threat the men posed			0
@entity17 had linked both @entity7 and @entity15 to @entity115 ’s extremist @entity114 group and its various offshoots			1
@entity7 cropped up in five inquiries , two of which were priority one investigations – the most serious classification			2
yet neither @entity17 or @entity122 was aware that he had travelled to @entity123 in november 2010 , where he was arrested on suspicion of attempting to travel to @entity125 to join the terror group @entity126			2
@entity122 , in particular , comes under blistering attack from the @entity105 for showing little interest in the fact a @entity62 national had been stopped as a possible ‘ jihadi tourist ’			0
however the @entity102 said : ‘ we have concluded that , given what the agencies knew at the time , they were not in a position to prevent the murder of @entity90			2
