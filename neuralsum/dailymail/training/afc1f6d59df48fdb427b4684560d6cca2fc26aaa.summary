members of the @entity2 church believe in the force , rather than the @entity4			1
it 's a religion barely two decades old and based off a movie franchise , but there 's still a lot the @entity2 have in common with other religious groups			1
details ' @entity10 recently attended a gathering of @entity2 in @entity13 , @entity14 where he witnessed the ' knighting ' of padawon learner @entity16 , 28 , an @entity17 - war veteran from @entity18			1
from the get go , ms @entity16 explains that her religion does n't seek to turn fictional characters like @entity23 or @entity24 into idols			2
the church began to form in the late 1990s , and is based off the league of knights from the @entity37 movie franchise ' no we do n't worship @entity23			1
and telekinesis is not something that we necessarily do - at least not like in the movies , ' she explains			2
but i wo n't deny that the @entity3 is very present in our teachings			0
some people call it magic			0
the scientific community calls it energy			0
you can find it in the @entity56			0
when @entity58 parted the @entity59 - how did he do that ? with energy			2
' @entity2 : @entity63 , aka @entity64 ( above ) , is one of the preeminent @entity2 church leaders			2
he has written five books on the religion while the group in @entity14 only included fifteen men and three women , the @entity2 church has been growing around the world			1
in @entity74 it 's the seventh - largest religion with 175,000 members			1
there are 15,000 @entity2 in the @entity77 , 9,000 in @entity78 and 65,000 in @entity79			0
while many of these so - called members list the @entity2 church as a joke , @entity83 , who runs @entity85 ( the most trafficked @entity2 church website online ) , estimates that there are about 5,000 real @entity2 in the @entity88 ' i 'm talking serious , committed @entity2 - not people who sign up on a website because they 're curious or bored , ' mr @entity83 says			1
one of @entity30 's prominent members , @entity63 ( known as @entity64 in the community ) , explains how the late 90s created the perfect storm upon which to start the religion			1
' with @entity30 you needed a way for people to connect , ' mr @entity63 says , meaning the internet			1
' and you needed something to reignite the imagination , which was the re-release of the first three @entity37 movies in 1997 , then the release of @entity105 in 1999			1
' while it may sound like a crazy concept , @entity30 already shares a lot with mainstream religions			2
like the @entity109 were driven from the @entity110 in their church 's early years , so the @entity2 are facing their own type of persecution			2
@entity63 explains that he usually keeps his @entity2 beliefs hidden from women in the early stages of a relationship			0
' yeah , there 's a stigma to being a @entity2			0
but most jedi prefer that to the baggage other religions carry around from history			0
you know , like the @entity125			0
' and who needs women when you can move objects with your mind ? @entity132 the battle of good versus evil : @entity63 , left , is pictured fighting another with the @entity2 's weapon of choice - the light - saber ' there have been times when i 've found myself on the freeway behind some horrible driver and i 'll do the @entity2 hand trick : " take the next exit , that is the exit you 're looking for ... " ' @entity63 said			2
@entity2 mind tricks aside , the group 's real center revolves around an ethical system just like any other religion			0
basically it all stems from a @entity2 code laid out in a @entity37 role - playing guide from 1987 , which states : ' there is no emotion , there is @entity158 is no ignorance , there is @entity159 is no passion , there is @entity160 is no death , there is the force			1
' anthropologist @entity163 who wrote ' @entity164 of the @entity37 : fans , merchandise , and the critics ' explains that it was the participatory nature of the book that helped start the religion , and the code 's content that gave it a purpose			1
@entity175 : above , @entity63 is pictured competing in a @entity176 ' @entity177 is in the glossary in the back in the " stuff you need to know " section			0
but what 's important about the book from an anthropological point of view , is that it 's participatory			0
it 's the first @entity37 role - playing game			1
before the book , you could only see the movies			0
afterward you could participate in its fictional world			0
and you ca n't have a religion without participation , ' @entity163 said			0
for members of @entity30 , the point of religion is not to secure some spot in the afterlife , but to do right for humankind on earth which translates to a lot of community service time			1
' with @entity30 ... our religious observance is found through service ot the community , ' said 30 - year - old @entity2 @entity208 , who is also a member of the @entity209			1
' service is sort of what we do for prayer			0

according to a report in details , the church based off the @entity37 franchise has grown to include thousands of members
in the @entity221 , @entity30 is the seventh - largest religion . *experts* estimate that there are 5,000 members in the @entity88
