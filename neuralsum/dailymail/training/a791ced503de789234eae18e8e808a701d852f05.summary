by @entity1 reporter published : 18:56 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 01:58 est , 4 april 2013 cranes have nested in southern @entity3 for the first time in 400 years – after a group of conservationists dressed as giant birds to show them how to do it			2
the common crane , as its name suggests , was once widespread in @entity11 , but came close to extinction around 1600 from overhunting and their wetlands habitat being drained			1
but now , after being raised from eggs at the @entity18 base in @entity19 , @entity20 , four birds have built their own nest on the @entity23 estuary			1
new home : cranes have nested in southern @entity3 again after having been driven close to extinction growing up : two of the cranes learn to fly at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 unusual techniques : the chicks at the center learning to fly , with two members of staff dressed in crane suits running along side to get them airbourne nature , however , needed a bit of a helping hand , as the birds had none of their own species around to teach them the necessary skills to survive in the wild			1
so staff at the @entity18 disguised themselves in custom - made crane suits and spent almost every day for 12 weeks with the birds			1
the young cranes were taught how to forage for food and avoid predators			0
human interaction without the crane suits was limited to ensure the birds did not lose their innate fear of people , as this could make them vulnerable in the wild			2
isolated : human interaction without the crane suits was limited to ensure the birds did not lose their innate fear of people , as this could make them vulnerable in the wild keeping a distance : a member of staff at the center holding one of the specially made poles used to feed the chicks @entity66 plans : as part of the @entity69 , supported by the @entity18 , it is hoped 100 cranes will have been released into the @entity71 by 2015 and the plan seems to have worked , as the birds finally made their new homes by the water			1
as part of the @entity69 , supported by the @entity18 , it is hoped 100 cranes will have been released into the @entity71 by 2015			0
this should help secure the birds ’ future by achieving a sustainable population in the @entity11			0
@entity69 aviculturist @entity80 , one of those who dressed as an adult crane to teach the birds , said : ‘ this beautiful bird was so iconic to @entity11 yet it was almost wiped out by hunting and the draining of our wetlands			2
clever : @entity89 chicks with one of the specially made poles used to feed them they 're back : the common crane , as its name suggests , was once widespread in @entity11 , but came close to extinction around 1600 from overhunting and their wetlands habitat being drained ‘ it may come to nothing , but this is an amazing moment seeing their first nest - building attempt in this part of the world for 400 years			1
' it ’s even more exciting knowing these are some of the birds we taught by hand to survive by themselves			0
i feel like a very proud parent			0
’ a small group of cranes has been established on a reserve in @entity116 since 1979 , but it is hoped this latest milestone will enable the birds to flourish on their own and eventually become a common sight in @entity11 ’s wetland areas once again .			0
