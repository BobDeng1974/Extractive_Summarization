there are countless ways people can spy on you nowadays - from hidden microphones to @entity5 , drones and security cameras			1
if this makes you feel paranoid , a firm has created a router that detects such surveillance devices and blocks them from accessing your @entity13 network			1
owners of the @entity15 , can also disconnect all target devices from any network they are associated with , including paired connections with phones			1
any device using the network to spy or stream content over the network are detected			1
an alarm is then signalled and the detected device is disconnected every wireless device has a unique hardware signature assigned to it by the manufacturer , these signatures are broadcast by wireless devices as they probe for , connect to and use wireless networks			1
@entity38 ' sniffs ' the air for these signatures , looking for devices its owner has selected to ban			2
if a banned device is discovered an alarm is triggered			0
further , if that device is found to be connected to a network that @entity38 is trained to guard , a stream of special ' de-authentication ' signals ( packets ) are sent to disconnect it			2
it does this automatically , without any interaction required from its owner			0

’ @entity15 can be operated in two modes the recommended mode is @entity77 , disconnecting target devices , such as drones ( stock image pictured ) from selected networks owned and operated by the user			1
all out mode disconnects detected devices from any network they are associated with an alarm is signalled when a device is detected , and the target equipment is disconnected from the network automatically , by @entity38			1
alarms can be triggered either using an audio sound , or through flashing leds and features will depend on the model bought			0
@entity15 can be operated in two modes			0
the recommended mode is @entity77 , disconnecting target devices from selected networks owned and operated by the user			0
the other mode is @entity99 , which disconnects all detected target devices from any network they are associated with , including paired connections with smartphones			2
the router also lets owners block specific devices , while allowing others			0
for example , during set up phase , owners can choose to allow smartphones to access the network , but not @entity5 devices ( pictured ) @entity38 is n’t a ‘ jammer ’			1
a jammer disrupts all signals within a given distance , while @entity38 detects and targets a specific device and only disconnects that specific gadget			0
the firm said @entity15 is n't designed for use in cases where there is already strict control over who uses the local wireless network , in a home , for example			2
instead , it has been created for networks used by lots of people , in a school , office or restaurant for example , that either provides an open network , or gives customers passwords			0
the router also lets owners block specific devices , while allowing others			0
for example , during set up phase , owners can choose to allow smartphones to access the network , but not @entity5 devices			1
two models will be initially available , later this year , priced between $ 50 ( £ 30 ) and $ 100 ( £ 60 ) @entity15 will ship to the @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , with other locations being added after launch .			1
