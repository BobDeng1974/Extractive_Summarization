by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 04:23 est , 28 december 2012 a forest - owning @entity2 aristocrat is to reintroduce bison into the wild in @entity5 for the first time in over 250 years			1
prince @entity7 is set to introduce a herd of eight @entity10 bison to his 32,124 - acre forest in @entity12			1
if the 79 - year - old prince 's plan works , @entity2 will be the first country west of @entity15 where animals , also known as wisent , will live in the wild once again			1
massive : @entity10 bison , also known as wisent , stand up to 6.5ft tall and can weigh up to a ton			2
now a @entity2 aristocrat has hatched an audacious plan to reintroduce them to the wild on his country estate however , there are fears the reintroduction of the wild , giant animals , which grow up to 6.5ft tall and weigh up to a ton , will scare away tourists and pose a hazard to hikers			1
nearly a decade in gestation , prince @entity7 's plan is set to enter its critical phase after he was given final approval from the state @entity43 in @entity45 just before @entity46 , @entity37 reports			2
his 50sq/mile estate - roughly half the size of @entity49 - surrounds the city of @entity51 and extends across many of the foothills of the @entity54			2
it is already home to about 300 wild sheep , 400 red deer , 600 wild boar and so many roe deer his seven groundsmen have given up trying to count them			1
a wisent calf eats a carrot : prince @entity7 is set to introduce a herd to his forest in @entity12 now over the next few days workers will drive into prince @entity7 's forest and take down the fence around an enclosure where his eight bison have been acclimatising to the environment since 2010			1
once that is done , the enormous bull , five cows and two calves will be free to roam			2
they will be the first of their species to wander wild in @entity2 since 1746			1
but questions have been raised about the possible impact of the mammoth creatures			0
they will roam wherever the leader takes them , even along major roads and through nearby villages			0
officials and residents of @entity51 , a city of some 20,000 people , have been largely in support of the plan , which they hope will bring tourists back following the decline of the @entity2 health spa industry			1
@entity10 bison were hunted to extinction in the wild in @entity5 centuries ago , but they lived on in @entity101 until a poacher killed the last wild specimen in the @entity104 in 1927			2
that would have been the end of this close relative of the more famous @entity109 bison , which is roughly as big , if it was n't for the few animals that survived in zoos			0
all of the roughly 3,000 wisents alive today are the descendants of only about a dozen original animals			0
however , residents of the @entity118 region , just on the other side of the @entity54 , fear that the animals could wreck tourism , damage forests , and even interbreed with dairy herds			0
despite the backing of such an august individual as @entity127 , the plan also met with scepticism from officialdom , with the state @entity43 putting together a long list of concerns that took scientists from four universities more than four years to answer			0
forestry economists eventually agreed that the bison herd could even be useful to forests , since they would keep ecologically valuable areas free from undergrowth - a task currently performed by forest workers			1
and a doctoral candidate at the @entity142 , @entity143 , conducted a study which finally showed the flighty bison , despite their imposing size , posed little threat to humans			0
after enlisting volunteers to approach the animals , he found they were far more likely to simply run away than make an attempt to charge people walking across their territory			0
this map shows the location of @entity156 and the forest where the bison will be set loose the wisents of @entity51 will never become a truly wild herd , because their numbers are too small , nevertheless this is the first time since 1746 that wisent will roam unchecked through a @entity2 forest			1
because their numbers are small , they will only stand a chance of survival if humans intervene carefully in their lives			0
rigorous family planning will be needed , because inbreeding will result if fresh genes are not introduced			0
the leaders of the herd will also be tracked via gps transmitters to limit their territory to roughly 40sq/km - about a third of prince @entity7 's estate			2
their winter feeding area , where they are supplied silage by forestry workers , will serve as their home and they are not expected to stray far since , as the prince says , ' they 're incredibly lazy animals ' .			0

@entity2 aristocrat to reintroduce herd of eight to his private forest
they will be the first to wander in the wild in @entity2 since 1746
