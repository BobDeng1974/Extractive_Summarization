a @entity1 professor has been forced to apologise for declining an @entity4 student 's internship because of the ' rape problem ' in his country			1
professor @entity8 's response to the application went viral after it was posted online and prompted a wave of indignation , forcing the intervention of @entity1 's ambassador to @entity4			1
her original response to the student 's application stated : ' @entity18 , unfortunately i do n't accept any @entity4 male students for internships			1
professor @entity8 's email ( pictured ) stated she did n't accept any male @entity4 students for internships because of the country 's ' rape problem ' in response @entity1 ambassador to @entity4 @entity27 wrote a letter ( pictured ) stating he ' strongly objected ' to her comments ' we hear a lot about the rape problem in @entity4 which i can not support			1
i have many female students in my group , so i think this attitude is something i can not support			0
' this was later posted online , with the professor 's and student 's names redacted under the title : ' what should an @entity4 male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of @entity4 being projected as an unsafe country for women ? ' following the outrage which erupted , she backtracked on her comments , stating in an apology posted to @entity1 's embassy website that she had ' made a mistake ' and apologized to ' everyone whose feelings i have hurt '			1
when her email came to light , ambassador @entity27 wrote a scathing letter rebuking her for the comments , stating : ' let me make it clear at the outset that i strongly object to this			2
' he added , in reference to a notorious 2012 @entity66 gang rape in which a woman died : ' the @entity69 case has triggered a lively , honest , sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that would n't be possible in many other countries			0
@entity1 's @entity4 ambassador @entity27 ( pictured ) condemned the professor 's comments in an open letter ' your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offence to these women and men ( activists ) ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in @entity4 ; and it is an offence to millions of law - abiding , tolerant , open - minded and hard - working @entity4			1
' let 's be clear : @entity4 is not a country of rapists			2
' in the 2012 case he referenced , the student was savagely attacked by six men including with an iron rod after boarding a private bus on her way home from the cinema with a male friend			0
the woman , who legally can not be named , died from her injuries 13 days later			0
the brutality of the assault and her determination to survive so she could report her attackers to police sparked large - scale street protests			0
four of her attackers were convicted and given the death penalty in september after the case was fast - tracked , while a juvenile was sentenced to a correctional facility			0
another died in jail after apparently committing suicide			0
the case sparked soul - searching about @entity4 's treatment of women and also led to initiatives to educate men about respect and equal gender rights in the deeply patriarchal country .			2
