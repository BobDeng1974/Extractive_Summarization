@entity0 has landed one of the toughest fights in boxing after finalising terms to face @entity5 on june 20			1
as revealed by @entity7 , the fight in @entity9 , @entity6 will not be for @entity5 's @entity11 super-middleweight world title			1
but it amounts to a huge , albeit daunting , opportunity for @entity0 , who failed in back - to - back challenges for @entity17 's @entity16 belt			1
@entity0 ( left ) has landed a shot at the unbeaten @entity6 @entity5 @entity5 ( right ) has not fought since he beat @entity19 on points in november 2013 in @entity21 he will face a man who outclassed @entity23 in 2011 , but who has been inactive since november 2013			1
ring rust from that 17 - month spell could be a factor in determining if @entity0 can beat one of the sport 's top pound - for - pound talents , with the 32 - year - old saying : ' i can not wait to get back in the ring and test myself against a class act like @entity5			2
' i proved that i belong at the top level with my performances against @entity17 and this is a challenge that i am relishing			0
@entity5 is a top pound - for - pound fighter and someone i respect a lot , but he has only boxed once in almost three years and i will give it everything i have got			2
' i am fresh and confident going into this fight			0
it 's a massive opportunity for me and one that i took with both hands when it was offered			0
i have spent a lot of time boxing in the @entity48 and i look forward to returning for this fight			0
' @entity5 said : ' i 'm very excited to be coming back on june 20 at @entity49 in my hometown of @entity9 , which has been a long time coming			2
i have an extremely tough fighter in front of me in @entity0 , who 's looking to pull the upset , but i ca n't let that happen			0
' i have to be on my best game to turn @entity0 away and beat him the way i want to beat him			0
' @entity5 's @entity11 world super-middleweight title will not be on the line when he faces @entity0 in june			1
