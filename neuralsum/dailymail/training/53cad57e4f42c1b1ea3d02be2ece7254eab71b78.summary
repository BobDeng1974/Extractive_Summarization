by @entity0 published : 00:55 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 03:33 est , 21 august 2013 @entity3 founder @entity2 is spear - heading an ambitious new effort to extend internet access across the developing world by lowering the cost of getting online			1
the new project , called @entity9 , launched early wednesday morning			2
it is a collaboration of some of the largest technology companies in the world , including handset makers @entity14 and @entity16 , telecom giant @entity17 , and chip designer @entity18			1
the project 's goals are lofty - helping to make the @entity22 affordable for five billion people people in developing nations in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
but , the methods are decidedly not flashy			0
@entity3 is trying to streamline its mobile app so that it consumes less internet bandwidth and is therefore cheaper to run for users paying by the megabyte			1
cellphone makers are trying to design handsets that have longer battery lives and draw internet bandwidth more efficiently			0
in five to 10 years , @entity9 hopes to reduce the cost of providing mobile internet by 99percent			1
' the goal of @entity9 is to make internet access available to the two - thirds of the world who are not yet connected and to bring the same opportunities to everyone that the connected third of the world has today , ' @entity2 said			1
inspiring words : the project used the words from president @entity70 's 1963 speech on peace in a nuclear world in a video introducing the idea the project focuses largely on mobile phone connectivity because billions of people in developing countries already use cell phones for talk and text			1
smart phones are also more affordable than personal computers and they are often more practical in regions with spotty electricity			0
@entity9 went live early wednesday with a slickly - produced site promoting the project			2
it features a moving , highly - polished that sets the words of president @entity70 's 1963 @entity89 speech on world peace to images of peoples in developing nations across the world			0
' today , @entity22 is n't accessible for two thirds of the world			0
imagine a world where it connects us all , ' the video intones			0
high hopes : @entity9 plans to leverage efficiency upgrades in mobile internet technology to make smart phones and internet access more affordable for billions the 29 - year - old billionaire is increasingly becoming a forceful public figure in public policy			1
he has previously spoken out about the importance of reforming the @entity110 immigration system to make it easier to bring in skilled workers			0
as with the immigration debate , @entity9 is n't entirely an egalitarian effort			0
@entity3 and the other partners in the project have already reached near - market saturation in the @entity110 , @entity118 , @entity119 and other parts of the developed world			2
extending internet access to the developed world is one way for @entity3 to grows its base of 1.15billion users .			1

@entity9 is a collaboration of @entity3 , @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and other tech companies
project focuses on reducing cost of mobile phone data so that more people can afford to get online
two thirds of the world does not have access to the internet
@entity3 and other tech companies could find new *customers* by connecting the developing world to the internet
