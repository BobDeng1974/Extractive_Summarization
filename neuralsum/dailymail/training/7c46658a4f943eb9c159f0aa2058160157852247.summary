by @entity0 and @entity1 in a recitation of death and destruction , a federal prosecutor on tuesday chronicled for a jury the alleged conduct of four @entity9 security guards accused of killing 14 @entity10 and wounding 18 others in downtown @entity12 nearly seven years ago			1
in opening statements at the trial of the four guards , assistant u.s. attorney t. @entity13 said some of the victims were ' simply trying to get out ' of the way of gunfire from @entity9 guards			1
' @entity22 died , 18 injured			2
for what ? ' he said			0
' @entity24 ' : former @entity9 security guards @entity26 ( top left ) , @entity27 ( top right ) , @entity28 ( bottom right ) and @entity30 ( bottom left ) have been charged in the deaths of 14 @entity10 one component of the prosecutors ' case is that the @entity9 guards harbored deep hostility toward @entity10 and boasted of indiscriminate firing of their weapons			1
immediately after the shootings at @entity42 on sept. 16 , 2007 , as soon as the guards got back to their base , they participated in a lie that there were insurgents in the area , said @entity13 ' that lie that they had begun that day would unravel within moments ' because two veteran @entity51 officers showed up on the scene to see what was going on , he said			1
one of the guards , @entity55 , is accused of first - degree murder			1
the other three — @entity30 , @entity26 and @entity27 — are on trial for voluntary manslaughter , attempted manslaughter and gun charges			1

massacre : an @entity10 police officer inspects a vehicle destroyed by the @entity9 guards in the alleged attacks on tuesday , @entity13 displayed graphic photos and video of the scene in the @entity10 capital , including a picture said to be the face of a motorist prosecutors said had been shot in the head			1
the victim was identified by the prosecution as the first victim to be killed in the shootings , @entity85			0
@entity28 is charged with first - degree murder in his death			2
on monday , in a preview of the photos and video , lawyers for the security guards had argued that it was unfair to the defendants to show the jury the photograph the prosecution said was of @entity98			2
they said the picture was meaningless without testimony from a doctor or a forensics expert			0
@entity104 district judge @entity103 said the photo alone was evidence that could be shown to the jury			0
but @entity103 ruled out another photo showing brain matter on the street and blood spatters on a car window			0
on monday @entity28 's lawyer , @entity113 , said it was ' pure imagination ' that the photo of the car driver amounts to evidence of @entity28 firing the shot that killed the driver			2
' i ca n't divine anything from that aside from body mass and charred remains , ' @entity113 said			0
in addition to allegedly killing 14 people , the @entity9 guards are accused of wounding 18 others during the 2007 attack lawyers for the @entity9 defendants are focusing on self - defense and state of mind in a war zone to explain their clients ' actions			1
one expert witness they plan to call would testify about the use of force in combat situations and the general threat level in @entity12 at the time of the shootings			0
another expert witness will testify that certainty or absolute proof that a perceived threat was deadly or imminent was not required in order for a contractor to respond with deadly force			0
rather , an individual would need only a reasonable perception , based on all the circumstances of which he was aware			0
@entity28 could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted			0
the other guards face a mandatory minimum penalty of 30 years in prison if they are convicted of the gun charge and at least one other charge .			2
