by @entity0 a huge hedgehog is causing her rescuers a prickly problem - by refusing to leave her favourite food and return to the wild			1
@entity7 the hedgehog was put on a strict diet in july last year after tipping the scales at more than 5lbs - more than double the average weight of an fully - grown hedgehog			1
the rescued hog soon shed half her body weight through the healthkick at her temporary home in @entity18			1
@entity7 , who was named after the place she was rescued , is almost double the size of an average adult hedgehog - thanks to her diet of mealworms @entity7 has refused to return to the wild because she does n't want to leave the diet of mealworms that she is given at her rescuer 's home in @entity18 but now @entity7 has got a little too comfortable with her diet of mealworms - and is refusing to return to the wild			1
despite being released in time for spring , the hedgehog has so far stayed put at her charity boss @entity37 ’s garden in @entity39 , @entity18 , preferring to stay and snack on mealworms			1
and now her weight has slowly crept back up to a hefty 3lbs - more than the 2lb average for an adult hog			0
@entity7 , named after the place where she was rescued , weighed just 400g - less than 1lb - when she arrived at @entity47 in the autumn of 2012			1
but her love of fatty mealworms meant her weight soared until she could not properly roll up to defend herself			0
with the arrival of spring , and @entity7 's new svelte figure , mr @entity51 decided the time was right to release @entity7 , along with four other rescued hedgehogs , back into the wild			2
the rescued hog was put on a strict diet in july last year after ballooning to more than 5lbs - more than double the average for an adult hedgehog @entity7 managed to slim down to around 2lbs , pictured above , but the weight has now crept on since the hedgehog has refused to leave home now @entity7 is refusing to leave charity boss @entity37 's garden in @entity39 , @entity18 , preferring to stay at the home and snack on her favourite food of mealworms november 2012 - 0.8lbs ( 415g ) june 2013 - 4.8lbs ( 2182g ) july 2013 - 4.5lbs ( 2079g ) october 2013 - 2.8lbs ( 1296g ) february 2014 - 2.4lbs ( 1127g ) march - 2.9lbs ( 1356g ) but while the other four hogs went off to explore when released into the garden , @entity7 stayed put			1
he said : ' we released her out in the back garden three weeks ago			0
' @entity7 has decided to stick around though and is staying in one of the special boxes we have for wild hogs in the garden			2
' she ’s even making herself right at home by taking the straw out the others and moving it to hers			0
she ’s well and truly tucked in			0
' mr @entity51 said the lure of her favourite snack was one of the reasons @entity7 stayed around - and is now contributing to her weight gain			2
he said : ' we do keep little bowls of mealworms under the shed and we ’ve watched her going under there for a good feed			0
' we will have to watch and restrict the mealworms again			0
it ’s likely she ’s going to be sticking around and will probably be back with us next winter for hibernation			0

@entity7 tipped the scales at 5lbs but lost more than half her *bodyweight*
she was put on a strict diet at the rescue *centre* in @entity18 , @entity110
now the hedgehog refuses to leave because she enjoys mealworms so much
