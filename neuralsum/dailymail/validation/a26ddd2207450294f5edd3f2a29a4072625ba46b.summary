@entity1 's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters , with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically			2
this is according to a new study that has combined 18 - years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites			1
the researchers claim that some ice shelves in @entity1 have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years			1
circles represent percentage of thickness lost ( red ) or gained ( blue ) in 18 years			2
the central circle shows the area not surveyed by the satellites satellite data from 1994 to 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels , scientists say			2
the findings , published today in the journal @entity31 , come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of global climate change on @entity37 's vast , remote polar regions			2
during the study period 's first half , to about 2003 , the overall volume decline around @entity1 was small , with @entity1 losses almost balanced out by gains in @entity43			1
after that , western losses accelerated and gains in the east ended			1
' there has been more and more ice being lost from @entity1 's floating ice shelves , ' said glaciologist @entity51 of the @entity52 at the @entity53			1
ice is added to the ice shelf by glaciers flowing off the continent and by snowfall			2
ice is lost when icebergs break off the ice front , and by melting in some regions as warm water flows into the ocean cavity under the ice shelf			2
under some ice shelves , cold and fresh meltwater rises to a point where it refreezes onto the ice shelf the @entity71 in the @entity72 and the @entity73 in the @entity74 , both in @entity1 , each shrank about 18 percent during the study period			1
climate change could make the food we eat taste worse , according to recent research			0
a major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase			0
the researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common , meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher			0
carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture			0
beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese			0
a separate study by marine biologists has also shown that shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify			0
they warn that as the planet 's oceans grow more acidic , due to rising carbon dioxide levels , many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising			0
shrimp raised in water with a lower ph were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting , while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest			0
' if the loss rates that we observed during the past two decades are sustained , some ice shelves in the @entity72 and @entity74 seas could disappear within this century , ' added @entity52 geophysics doctoral candidate @entity124			1
the melting of these ice shelves does not directly affect sea levels because they are already floating			1
' this is just like your glass of gin and tonic			0
when the ice cubes melt , the level of liquid in the glass does not rise , ' @entity124 said			0
but the floating ice shelves provide a restraining force for land - based ice , and their reduction would increase the flow of the ice from the land into the ocean , which would increase sea levels			1
' while it is fair to say that we 're seeing the ice shelves responding to climate change , we do n't believe there is enough evidence to directly relate recent ice shelf losses specifically to changes in global temperature , ' @entity51 said			1
oceanographer and co-author @entity156 of @entity37 & @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity155 said for a few @entity161 ice shelves , ice loss can be related fairly directly to warming air temperatures			1
much of the increased melting elsewhere is probably due to more warm water getting under the ice shelves because of increasing winds near @entity1 , @entity156 added			1
@entity51 said future studies will concentrate on the causes behind changes in ice shelf volume , including the effects of the atmosphere and ocean			0
' we 're looking into connections between @entity178 events in the tropical @entity179 and changes in the @entity161 ice sheet , ' said @entity52 graduate student @entity124			2
' it 's very far apart but we know that these teleconnections exist			0
that may ultimately allow us to improve our models for predicting future ice loss			0
' the researchers claim that some ice shelves in @entity1 have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years			1
@entity1 's @entity190 is pictured			0

scientists combined 18 - years of ice thinning data from three satellites
until 2003 , @entity161 losses were balanced by @entity199 gains
but after that , western losses accelerated and gains in the east ended
some ice shelves in the @entity72 could disappear within this century
