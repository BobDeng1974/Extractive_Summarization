@entity1 's new prime minister has come under fire for appointing female ministers for their beauty rather than their brains - an identical row to that which engulfed his playboy predecessor @entity8			1
@entity9 , who came to power in february , has gone to lengths to distance himself from @entity8 , who made no secret of his penchant for attractive young women , selecting a former glamour model to join his cabinet and cavorting with showgirls and models at his famous @entity20 parties			1
but yesterday the @entity22 leader was attacked by one of his most senior female politicians for doing the same thing for which ' @entity8 ' was ridiculed throughout his premiership			2
popular : @entity27 ( left ) has been the focus of much tabloid attention since becoming minister for reform , for her youth and photogenic looks as well as her figure - hugging business suits , while foreign minister @entity34 's ( right ) looks have not gone unnoticed either in the @entity1 media pored over : @entity36 , the 34 - year - old minister for public administration , is also regularly pored over by the @entity1 press @entity39 , a stalwart of the centre - left party and now president of a parliamentary anti-mafia commission , said : ' i believe some of the ministers were chosen because they are young and also good - looking			1
' after taking the reigns of government after an internal party coup seven months ago , 39 - year - old @entity9 - who is nicknamed @entity49 for his no - nonsense approach to political reform - formed a new cabinet notable for its youth high proportion of female politicians			1
among them is @entity27 who has been the focus of much tabloid attention since becoming minister for reform , for her youth and photogenic looks as well as her figure - hugging business suits			1
but the 33 - year - old hit back at ms @entity39 's claim yesterday , saying : ' i believe that we will be judged on how good we are , not how good - looking we are			2
we need to respond to the needs of ordinary people and that is what we are doing every day			0
' attack : @entity39 ( right ) , a stalwart of the centre - left party and now president of a parliamentary anti-mafia commission said @entity9 ( left ) had chosen some ministers ' because they are young and good - looking ' young cabinet : after taking the reigns of government seven months ago , 39 - year - old @entity9 ( centre ) formed a new cabinet notable for its youth high proportion of female politicians			1
eight out of 16 are women she has surprised the stuffier corners of @entity1 politics in pushing through a complicated series of reforms to the country 's @entity86			0
she is not the only female politician to have attracted attention for reasons other than her work			0
foreign minister @entity34 , 41 , and @entity36 , the 34 - year - old minister for public administration , are also both regularly pored over by the @entity1 press			1
but today , a number of other female politicians leapt to their defence , with one branding ms @entity39 's comments ' an old - fashioned way of looking at things			1
' @entity8 raised eyebrows in 2008 when he appointed @entity102 ( right ) as government spokesperson a year after saying of her : ' if i was not already married i would have married her immediately ' ' beauty has nothing to do with it , ' deputy party secretary @entity107 told @entity108 on sunday			2
' the ministers were chosen because they are competent and capable			0
' @entity111 @entity110 , another @entity22 politician whose looks have attracted attention , added : ' they 've demonstrated that aside from their physical appearances , they are competent			2
in politics some people are afraid of a strong woman who is also good - looking			0
' ms @entity39 herself was once mocked by @entity8 on national television when he called her ' prettier than she is intelligent ' - a slight intended to imply that she is neither			2
@entity8 became infamous in @entity1 for his sexist gags , dalliances with teenage underwear models and debauched ' @entity20 ' that provided the world media 's headline writers with a near unending flow of material throughout his premiership			0
in 2008 , he raised eyebrows across @entity1 media and political circles when he appointed former glamour model @entity102 as government spokesperson , a year after saying of her : ' if i was not already married i would have married her immediately			0
' he later made a grovelling public apology to his wife for ' wounding her dignity '			0
mr @entity9 's supporters have been at pains to make clear his attitudes towards women are in no way related to those of mr @entity8 .			0
