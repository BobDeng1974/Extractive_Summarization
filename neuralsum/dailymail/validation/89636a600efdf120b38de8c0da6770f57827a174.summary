@entity1 's @entity0 are in a mini-crisis mode , with world stars like @entity4 and @entity5 struggling for form			1
real fan @entity7 of @entity8 writes on the team 's current troubles , and why he would n't hesitate to drop a big name			0
@entity1 ’s @entity0 have recorded five losses , two draws and just one win in @entity15 ’s toughest venues since the @entity16 took over : @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , @entity23 ( @entity24 ) and @entity25 ( @entity26 )			2
the fans remember how successful the team was during last season ’s run at the @entity31 and the @entity32 , and they also have in mind why that happened			0
in those three games – the @entity32 final and the @entity31 semi-finals — @entity0 played with a 4 - 4 - 2 formation that allowed them to defend properly and counterattack at the earliest opportunity			1
@entity4 looks on in horror after @entity42 score to consign @entity0 to another defeat a sorry @entity0 forward line kick off after @entity45 sends @entity25 wild by putting @entity26 ahead @entity0 employed a 4 - 4 - 2 to devastating effect against @entity48 in last season 's @entity31 the team ’s attacking trio of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity52 did not feature together on two out of those three games , the other one being the return leg against @entity48 in the @entity56			1
injuries to @entity5 ( a 1 - 0 win against @entity48 at the @entity59 ) and @entity4 ( @entity32 final ) forced @entity1 to use a 4 - 4 - 2 system that proved to be so solid that the @entity16 coach played @entity5 as a midfielder on @entity0 ’s historic 4 - 0 win in @entity65			1
this season , @entity5 also had to miss last october ’s @entity67			0
@entity1 knew what he had to do , he used that same 4 - 4 - 2 formation with @entity70 and @entity71 on the wings , and @entity0 were able to come back and earn a convincing 3 - 1 win against @entity74 considering how badly the team have struggled against @entity22 and @entity20 since 2015 started , it ’s not surprising to see that several polls around the @entity79 media prove that the fans want to see that 4 - 4 - 2 formation again			1
@entity82 star @entity5 has provoked the ire of the @entity0 fans for his percieved selfishness many @entity0 fans are calling for @entity5 to be the odd man out if they are to switch back to the 4 - 4 - 2 system the £ 86million @entity5 tries in vain to turn around his side 's fortunes in saturday 's disappointing loss if that happens , @entity1 will either be forced to move one of the @entity95 to the bench or play @entity5 in a much more defensive role			1
that will turn @entity0 into a less - glamorous side , but they will also be a solid team capable of beating tough opponents once and for all			0
the @entity95 - system works and is good enough to easily dismantle most @entity15 and @entity31 teams			0
but whenever you go up against the best clubs in @entity107 football , you need to have a good defensive plan that the usual 4 - 3 - 3 formation does not provide			2
given that @entity4 is @entity0 's best player and that @entity52 is the team 's only centre forward , it would be reasonable to think that @entity5 would indeed be the one moving to the bench if @entity1 decides to use this 4 - 4 - 2 formation , and that would be the right call			1
the buck stops with manager @entity1 when it comes to choosing a big name to lose from his line - up @entity52 is crucial to the team 's fluidity upfront , setting up his teammates and helping the midfielders at controlling the tempo of the game , and unless @entity4 changes his game and becomes a pure striker , the @entity126 is the only player in the roster capable of doing that			2
while it would be tempting not to pay attention to the fans ' whistles , having the @entity59 fans against you is always the first step towards a move out of the club , and that 's why @entity1 should try to regain the fans ' support			2
the @entity59 is a very demanding crowd and they have already affected the way @entity5 plays			0
after the whistles , the @entity82 player is not attempting nearly as many shots as he was when things were working out well for him , so @entity1 will surely use @entity5 's experience as a good example to change @entity0 's shape and improve the way his team is defending			1
if a £ 86m player needs to sit on the bench , so be it			0
@entity0 's deadly rivals @entity18 are in form , with @entity159 and @entity160 celebrating against @entity161			0

@entity0 lost to @entity42 1 - 0 on saturday in a blow to their title chance
many fans are calling for a return to @entity1 's 4 - 4 - 2 formation
@entity172 star @entity5 could be sacrificed in the starting *xi*
