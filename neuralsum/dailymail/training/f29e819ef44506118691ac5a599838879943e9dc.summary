@entity0 have never made an approach for @entity2 , according to @entity4 manager @entity3			1
the @entity6 youngster was linked with a £ 60million move to the @entity9 champions last summer with the @entity10 even claiming the 20 - year - old was ' the player @entity0 covet more than any other '			1
however , @entity3 - speaking ahead of his side 's visit to the @entity15 on saturday - insisted that @entity0 have never made direct contact over the player he claims will become ' the best player @entity6 has ever had			1
' @entity2 is not a big money target for @entity0 , according to @entity4 boss @entity3 @entity3 ( left ) believes @entity2 is gradually returning to his best after a spell out injured ' we have a great relationship with @entity0			1
we signed @entity24 on loan from them and the relationship has always been good but there has never been an approach about @entity2 , ' he said			2
honestly , @entity0 are not trying to do that			2
maybe if you are a selling club they could try that , but we are not a selling club			0
' i think every game we play there is a link with one of our players			0
when we went to @entity42 it was @entity43 and when you go to another ground it is @entity46			0
' @entity2 does n't care			2
he could play in the most intense game of football with the most intense atmosphere and the biggest meaning and all he sees is an enjoyment			0
that is the big attribute he has			0
' @entity2 , who turns 21 next week , has been sidelined by injury at the start of this campaign but @entity3 says he is gradually returning to his best form			1
the 20 - year - old has impressed despite @entity4 's recent run of poor results , including a 2 - 1 loss to @entity61 @entity4 have a good relationship with @entity0 after bringing in @entity24 ( left ) from the @entity15 ' i think he has improved massively			1
it is unfair to look at @entity2 's performances and blame our results on that , ' he said , after seeing his side beaten 2 - 1 by @entity61 and then held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity72 in the last week			0
' can he improve ? of course he can because he is a young man who has all the potential in the world			0
i see massive improvement in certain areas from where he was last season and i think we are going to see the best @entity2 in the second half of the season			0
' @entity83 , before the injury , @entity2 was at his very best			1
injury set him back and it stops you from getting the rhythm but after @entity87 we are clearly going to see the best of @entity2			2

@entity2 has been *previously* linked with a £ 60m move to @entity0
@entity3 claims the champions have never *enquired* about him
