they were joined by supposedly respectable professionals and tradesmen whose lawyers said they had been caught up in a ' moment of madness ' as anarchy took hold of the streets			1
some stood accused of attempting to incite rioting with incendiary messages on social networking sites			0
judges refused to grant bail in the majority of cases , telling suspects they must face a @entity99 judge who can impose stiffer punishments			0
