most three year olds ca n't wait for summer so they can play outdoors for hours on end			2
but for one little boy , being out in the sun causes his skin to blister and burn uncontrollably			2
@entity5 has become one of the youngest people to be diagnosed with a rare and incurable genetic condition which makes him completely intolerant to all uv rays			1
@entity5 's parents @entity11 and @entity13 try to keep his life as normal as possible , but every part of their son must be covered by uv - protective clothing when he ventures outside			1
he must wear gloves and a hat with attached visor made of specialist film that covers his face , neck and shoulders and clothes specially selected to block uv rays			1
the condition affects fewer than 1,000 around the world and means he is at an increased risk of getting cancer from sunlight @entity5 must be covered by factor 50 + sun block every three hours ( he is pictured left and right playing in his protective suit )			1
he also plays in his own specially - designed indoor garden when it 's too bright outside @entity5 's body must also be covered by factor 50 + sun block every three hours and he plays in his own , specially - designed , indoor garden when it is too bright outside			1
he suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum ( xp ) , a condition which means he could get cancer from sunlight			1
his condition affects fewer than 100 people in @entity57 and about 2,000 around the world , but he is one of the youngest to be told he has the disorder			0
mrs @entity60 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , said their lives ' completely changed ' after @entity5 's diagnosis at just three months			2
the 36 - year - old , said : ' the condition affects every aspect of his life and we have to think of things that others would take for granted			2
' people do n't understand the everyday issues we have to consider			0
' we have to make sure @entity5 is n't near to the door when the postman opens the letterbox and we have had to have an @entity79 system installed because we ca n't open any windows in our house			2
' but he is just a normal little boy			0
he loves getting messy in his sandpit , playing on his bike or with his little brother @entity84			0
' our goal is just to help him live his life like a normal child			0
' @entity5 started displaying symptoms of being extremely sensitive to both natural and artificial light at just three months old			1
@entity36 ( @entity36 ) is a life - altering genetic condition characterised by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet ( @entity93 ) rays			1
@entity93 is in sunlight , most artificial lighting and even lightning			0
unless patients with @entity36 are protected from uv , their skin and eyes may be severely damaged and this can lead to cancer			1
@entity36 is an extremely rare hereditary condition with less than 100 cases in the @entity57			2
about 30 per cent of people with @entity36 also develop neurological abnormalities which can include hearing loss and loss of mobility			0
there is no cure for @entity36 , but much can be done to prevent and treat some of the problems it causes			0
these include protection from uv , including total daylight avoidance , specialised clothing and sunscreens			0
people with @entity36 must also undergo frequent skin , eye and neurological examinations and have prompt removal of cancerous tissue			2
source : @entity123 his eyes and skin were worst affected and he developed severe abnormal burns			2
after initially assuming he was suffering from allergies a number of hospital visits and tests at @entity133 in @entity134 later revealed he had xp			0
@entity5 's family said that it was a common misconception that having xp simply meant keeping out of direct sunlight			1
mrs @entity60 , said : ' uv is present during all daylight hours and danger is still present indoors , with uv rays emitted by many sources of artificial lighting			1
' she added that the family looks forward to the clocks going back			0
' during the summer i calculated that @entity5 and i spent less than 24 hours outside in six weeks so obviously that 's an extremely challenging time of year , ' she said			1
' but the minute the clocks go back we get so much more time outside - it 's wonderful			0
' i know @entity5 is going to face many challenges in his life but it is our job as parents to make sure he gets as much out of life as possible			0
' following the diagnosis @entity5 's aunt @entity158 from @entity159 , @entity157 set up a fundraising group called the @entity123			1
overwhelmed by the support received by the @entity123 , @entity5 's family decided they would build on its success and try and help others with the rare disorder			1
now they have launched their own set of teddy bears and books and hope their ' @entity173 ' products can be sent to all the estimated affected 300 children in the world			0
mrs @entity60 , said : ' we looked for ways to help educate @entity5 in understanding his condition , and we immediately looked for appropriate reading that might help us find the words to explain this			2
' @entity5 loved the initial story i wrote , and really engaged with it so before long i started thinking of further additions to this and a small series of ' @entity173 ' stories emerged			0
@entity5 's parents say their goal is to help him live his life like a normal child			2
here he is pictured with parents @entity11 and @entity13 and brother @entity84 @entity5 is pictured being slathered with factor 50 sunblock by mother @entity11			1

he loves getting messy in his sandpit , playing on his bike or with his little brother @entity84 ' ' we have set ourselves a goal to provide a copy free of charge to all children within our reach around the world affected by @entity36			1
' the illustrator of the book , @entity211 , said : ' i feel very privileged to be a part of the @entity215 project ; it 's fantastic to work on a book that will help children across the world , it has been a very rewarding experience			0
' a spokesman for @entity220 , who are printing the book , added : ' receiving the book and teddy that the @entity123 have so lovingly and expertly created from scratch , could make a massive impact on the children who suffer from @entity36 and their supportive families			1
