by @entity0 doctors , dentists , nurses and midwives who ca n't speak @entity5 well enough may be struck off under new draft legislation published today			1
health regulators in charge of the @entity10 's 1.4million health workers will for the first time be given powers to bar professionals simply because their command of the @entity5 language is considered so poor as to ' impair their fitness to practise '			1
the @entity18 's new draft @entity16 covers nine bodies ranging from the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) to the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and the @entity22 ( @entity22 )			1
social workers in @entity5 will also be covered			2
care : doctors and dentists may be struck off if their @entity5 is poor under new draft legislation published today the regulation of @entity28 bill has been drafted to improve safety for patients who might be at risk when under the care of a health professional who ca n't communicate with them properly			1
the 2008 case of @entity39 doctor , @entity40 , who accidentally killed @entity43 patient @entity42 , 70 , when he confused two drugs and gave him ten times the recommended dose of diamorphine , highlights the risks of doctors with poor @entity5 working in the @entity10			1
currently the nine bodies , which also cover chiropractors , osteopaths , opticians , and pharmacists , are bound by different rules on what they can do to govern health workers with poor @entity5			2
at the moment , some can only investigate once they have received a formal complaint , and others can only investigate if the medic with poor @entity5 is suspected of having made a mistake already			2
the @entity21 has loose guidelines which put the onus on checking the professional 's @entity5 with the employer , and are not able to strike them off simply because of the language issue			0
meanwhile the @entity20 can only check the language skills of workers if they are from outside the @entity71			0
the regulations for the @entity20 , however , will change later this year when new rules come in to force allowing the testing of medics ' language skills before they can work			0
today 's new draft @entity16 states : ' we want the regulators to have powers to investigate concerns relating to a professional ’s knowledge of @entity5 before specific instances of deficient performance occur			1
midwives will also be governed by the new legislation which covers 32 health professions ( file picture ) ' this new ground should include , for example , inability or likely inability to communicate a diagnosis or advice to patients and service users , or an inability to read dosage levels when administering medication			1
' the sanctions regulators can impose will be extended and , for the first time , they will be able to discipline or strike off professionals who are not able to communicate clearly in @entity5			2
the @entity16 also allows regulators to reconsider cases that have been closed following a mistake or error , as recommended by the inquiry into the scandal at @entity112			1
a process of revalidation , where professionals undergo ' mots ' to ensure they are still fit to practise , will be extended from doctors to all health and social care professionals			1
@entity39 doctor @entity40 , pictured , gave an @entity5 patient a massive and fatal dose of diamorphine after confusing two drugs schemes could also be introduced to bar unregulated workers from providing services , according to the @entity10 - wide recommendations			1
@entity127 , the commissioner leading the project for @entity5 and @entity129 , said : ' the professional regulators of the health and social care field operate within a wide variety of legal frameworks that have been agreed and amended by @entity135 in different ways , at different times , over the past 150 years			1
' our recommended reforms place patient protection firmly at the heart of a new legal framework			0
' if implemented , they will enhance the autonomy of the regulators , empower them to respond more quickly and effectively to emerging public health concerns and enable them to meet the demands of a modern , devolved health and social care sector			2
' a joint letter signed by the regulators calls on the government to support the new plans and asks for ' urgent parliamentary consideration ' of the @entity16			0
it said : ' the recommendations of @entity159 following events in @entity161 highlighted the vital importance of effective regulation focused on promoting safe , compassionate patient care rather than , as too often in the past , intervening only after patients have suffered harm			0
' @entity167 , head of the @entity21 , said : ' i would strongly urge the government to include this @entity16 in the timetable for the last parliamentary session			0
' without it the @entity21 can not modernise its “ outdated and inflexible ” decision making processes			0
' in 2008 , 70 - year - old @entity42 died after he was given a fatal dose of diamorphine by @entity39 out - of - hours locum , @entity40			1
@entity40 was working on his first shift in @entity43 when he saw mr @entity42 , who was suffering from kidney stones			2
he gave mr @entity42 ten times the correct amount of painkiller after confusing two drugs			0
that same year , it emerged that foreign doctor @entity183 was allowed to work as a locum for ten months despite having such poor @entity5 , he did n't understand ' crash call ' - the basic medical term for heart attack - thinking it meant car crash			0
victims : @entity42 , 70 , and @entity190 , 94 , both died after they were treated by doctors with poor @entity5 the @entity194 - born doctor , who qualified in @entity195 , @entity196 , did n't know how to perform @entity197 , did n't wash his hands properly , and slapped patients to see if they were conscious			2
he was eventually struck off by the @entity20 in january 2011 after it emerged that no - one in @entity10 had checked to see what work he had done in @entity196 before coming to @entity10			0
also in 2008 , @entity203 grandmother @entity202 , 94 , lost nearly half the blood in her body during what should have been a routine hip operation after @entity39 doctor @entity208 severed an artery and became so flustered he started speaking in @entity39			0
another doctor had to step in to sort out the chaos but the accident left mrs @entity202 bedbound , and her inability to walk led to her developing pneumonia that killed her eight weeks later .			0
