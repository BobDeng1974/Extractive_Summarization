march : protesters assembled in @entity5 , @entity25 , where the names of 110 slain citizens were read out ' we have looked at it only as racism , and racism is a byproduct of prejudice , ' he said , @entity28 reported			1
' prejudice exists in every one of us , whether we are black , white , brown , yellow			0
' whatever our color , wherever we come from , we have prejudice			0
it is those prejudices that spawn these kinds of byproducts like racism and gender disparities and homophobia			0
' rev @entity45 addressed the crowds to list all 110 slain citizens since january this year before releasing balloons into the sky			2
standing outside the @entity50 at midday today , the group held a four - minute silence for @entity3 to recognize the four hours his body was left lying in the street after he was shot dead by police officer @entity54			1
emotional : dr @entity6 blamed prejudice in @entity5 for the shootings of 110 people in the city this year the protest urged mothers to make an emotional plea to police in a desperate bid to end violence in the city			1
their words followed @entity67 's fierce speech this morning condemning police officer @entity54 , who claims he shot @entity3 in self - defense			1
listing other black teenagers shot by white men , he also branded the shooting racist , and said : ' we were involved in @entity73			0
we were supportive of @entity74			0
' the strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse ... the only gun there was @entity54 's ! @entity81 parallels with all of these cases			0
' in his own version of events , revealed by the @entity86 , the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life			0
@entity54 insists @entity3 viciously launched through the window of his police car , punching and scratching him repeatedly			1
police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger			0
anger : hundreds of mothers gathered outside @entity50 today in an emotional plea to police to desist from violence			2
here crowds are seen holding their hands up in tribute to @entity3 eventually , @entity54 said , he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip , fired two shots , and one hit @entity3 's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform			1
the account stops there and fails to explain why @entity3 was shot a further four times outside the vehicle			2
since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident , legal experts warn @entity54 's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury , a legal expert told @entity127			1
slamming the account as illogical , @entity67 today raged at his weekly @entity129 rally in @entity130 that it is the ' same excuse ' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men			0
' it sounds like a @entity137 defense , ' he said , referring to the @entity139 man who has been convicted of first - degree murder for shooting dead black teenager @entity74			2
@entity137 claimed he did it because @entity74 was playing music too loudly			0
' it did n't work in @entity139 and it should n't work in @entity25 , ' @entity67 added			0
he spluttered : ' first of all , if you stopped him - @entity3 and his friend - walking down the street , what led to the scuffle ? ' secondly , how does he and you get in your car ? you trying to do what by yourself ? ' @entity67 asked			2
' now , if i go with you with your story all the way to that - that @entity3 was shot , gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him ? '			2
