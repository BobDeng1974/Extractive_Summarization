it was so nearly the ultimate fairytale for @entity1 , who came off the bench to score two goals for @entity4 in their semi-final with @entity6			1
his immediate impact , and first two goals for the club , nearly rescued the @entity11 tie for the @entity12 before @entity14 's late heroics guided @entity6 into the final			1
but who is the 18 - year - old striker who only joined the @entity19 side in november ? @entity20 gives you the lowdown on @entity4 's cup sensation			1
@entity1 came off the bench to score two goals for @entity4 against @entity6 so who is @entity4 ’s two - goal hero ? his full name is @entity29 @entity28 , the 18 - year - old striker was snapped up by the @entity12 in november			1
should i have heard of @entity31 ? probably not			0
he was playing for @entity33 before moving to the @entity19 side , though he was heavily scouted by the likes of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
his @entity12 career had seen him play just three times previously but he did make his debut in the 1 - 0 win over @entity36 in the @entity11 quarter - final as a half - time substitute			1
@entity1 came on as a substitute for @entity4 in the 74th minute and scored three minutes later after finishing neatly across @entity49 's goal following a low far post cross @entity1 celebrates scoring his first goal for the club which levelled the scores on the night at 1 - 1 did n't @entity54 through the net ? @entity1 was on the books at the @entity57 before they released him , and his form became so impressive in the non-league ranks that up to 45 scouts were watching him at one point			1
he took his goals against spurs well , but is there more to his game ? indeed there is			0
his strike record was impressive at @entity66 with nine goals in 16 games , but he also contributed with 11 assist during that period too			2
what are his strongest abilities ? it 's best to let his former manager @entity72 give a lowdown on that			0
@entity72 was excited about the striker 's potential after he sold him to @entity4 back in november			2
the second goal for @entity1 came just two minutes after his first , a low drive inside the box deflected past @entity49 by @entity6 defender @entity80 ( right ) @entity6 midfielder @entity81 stands dejected as @entity1 celebrates scoring the @entity12 ' second goal of the evening to give them a 2 - 1 lead - a scoreline which would have earned the @entity19 side extra time @entity4 players congratulate @entity1 following his immediate impact , before @entity14 restored @entity6 ' aggregate lead in the @entity11 semi-final ' @entity1 is one of those players that comes along every so often and makes you think , ‘ wow ’ , ” said @entity72 in an interview with @entity94			1
' he ’s got pace in abundance , but he ’s really powerful too			0
i remember a goal he scored against @entity99 , where he picked the ball up in his own half , drove at their defence and finished in the bottom corner			2
' his biggest asset is that knack of changing games in the blink of an eye			0
he stands defenders up and then leaves them for dead			0
in fact , i ’d say he ’s capable of doing things that i have n’t seen players do for a long , long time			0
' @entity113 i should know about @entity31 ? @entity1 has already been earmarked to play for @entity114 at international level and was formally called up to the @entity117 team last october			2
he is also eligible to represent @entity118			0
@entity1 applauds fans following the second leg semi-final clash having caused @entity6 an almighty scare @entity4 boss @entity122 instructs his team during the cup tie , with the @entity12 boss having signed @entity1 from @entity66 in november			1

@entity1 scored twice for @entity4 against @entity6
striker came off bench to turn around @entity11 semi-final tie
the 18 - year - old only joined @entity12 in november from non-league @entity66
