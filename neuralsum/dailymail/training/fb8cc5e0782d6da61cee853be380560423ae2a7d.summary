the 36 - year - old cyclist equalled sir @entity9 ’s record ­ @entity11 tally of five gold medals as he powered to victory in the men ’s team sprint			1
it was one of three golds for @entity18 yesterday			1
but the spectacular win was mired in controversy last night after one of @entity1 's teammates claimed he had deliberately fallen from his bike in an earlier round			1
today , the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) said @entity27 's gold medal would stand			1
asked if they would look at the result , @entity25 communications director @entity28 said : ' at present there are no plans to do so			1
our view is that people were not deprived of a contest			2
' i have spoken to the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) and they are obviously aware of the situation			2
at at this stage they do n't see any reason to question the result and neither do we			1
the trio went on to post a world record time and later won the final against @entity63			0
@entity47 , 19 , suggested the crash was part of a deliberate ploy because the @entity11 team had made a poor start			1
he said after winning gold : ' we were saying if we have a bad start , we need to crash to get a restart			2
i just crashed , i did it on purpose to get a restart , just to have the fastest ride			0
so it was all planned , really			0
' last night @entity79 categorically denied the fall was any part of a plan and said @entity47 's comments were ' lost in translation ' from a man who began learning @entity86 only after moving to @entity87 from his native @entity58 two years ago			1
tainted gold : sir @entity1 celebrates his win by kissing his wife @entity3			1
but the victory was mired in controversy last night @entity1 and his wife @entity3 pose with the gold medal @entity47 crashed in the heat , but the race was allowed to be restarted - and trio stormed to a new world record early wobble : @entity100 lost control of his bike soon after the start of qualyifing the @entity104 confirmed that the incident had been reviewed at the time and the result was not in question – so all three @entity11 cyclists will keep their gold medals			1
losing finalists @entity63 said the action was not against the rules so they will not dispute the result			2
but they said it left a ' bitter ' taste and they called for a change in the way such incidents are handled			0
@entity47 subsequently denied it was deliberate when asked about his earlier comments			1
' no , ' he said , ' i just went out the gate and just lost control , just fell down			1
' my back wheel slipped and totally lost control and then i could n’t handle the bike any more and just crashed			1
' there was also gold for @entity27 in the double trap clay shooting with farmer ’s son @entity132			2
and @entity134 and @entity135 won the canoe slalom pairs			0
by @entity0 and @entity137 it was an evening of high drama , ecstasy and total heartbreak			0
amid extraordinary noise and excitement from 6,000 packed in the @entity144 , champion cyclist sir @entity1 joined sir @entity9 on five gold medals – the most by any @entity11 @entity146 – as he led home the three - man team sprint in a world record time			1
but his victory came just 37 minutes after the shattering disqualification of @entity11 golden girl @entity153 and her partner @entity154 in the women ’s sprint			0
there were gasps of disbelief from a crowd including the @entity161 and @entity162 , prince @entity163 and @entity164 , as it was announced that the gold medal favourites had been ‘ relegated ’ after @entity153 appeared to move too early at the end of the first lap of the two - lap race			1
emotional @entity1 wipes away tears as the team take to the podium @entity1 is now @entity27 's greatest ever gold medal winner with five , alongside rowing legend sir @entity9 record breaker : an exhausted @entity1 celebrates with coach @entity175 at the side of the @entity144 track after his triumph in the @entity180 final the devastated 31 - year - old had seen her dream of three gold medals in @entity184 – her final championship before retiring – vanish in the blink of an eye			1
devastated : a shattered @entity153 has her dream dashed by disqualification she tearfully buried her head in her hands , shaking her head in disbelief			0
@entity27 ’s cycling boss @entity194 hurled a water bottle at a wall in frustration , while a clearly shocked @entity153 was comforted by @entity1			1
she then went backstage where she was seen ‘ sobbing ’ with friends and family			0
her partner , @entity154 – who is not competing in any other event – left the building without giving interviews			0
@entity153 and @entity154 had made a blistering start to their campaign , setting a new world record in their qualifying round only to see @entity211 better it in the next heat			2
they were set for a gold medal race - off against @entity211 , but then officials said they had been relegated			1
@entity153 said : ‘ i ’m desperately disappointed for @entity154 because she has done an incredible job in getting this far			0
' her team sprint today was the best of her life so far			0
i ’ve no doubt she will be back in @entity223 and absolutely smashing it			0
i ’m sorry for disappointing all the people that have come to support us and perhaps not offering the ride that we would have done			0
’ the cyclist , who has two events left – the individual sprint and keirin – admitted : ‘ we ’re both partly to blame			0
we were a bit overwhelmed by the moment			0
’ flagging : five - time gold medal winner @entity1 , draped in the @entity236 , becomes emotional as his @entity6 win sinks in proud to be @entity11 : @entity1 soaks up the adulation of the fervent home support inside the @entity144 after his historic win last night the @entity58 sprint pair who took gold called for a change in ‘ weird ’ rules governing technical disqualifications			1
‘ it is not the way we wanted to win , ’ one said			2
the contrast could not have been greater to the celebrations that greeted @entity1 ’s victory with @entity45 and @entity47 as they defeated @entity63 in a thrilling final win that took @entity27 ’s gold medal tally to five – three in one day			1
in formation : @entity27 's men ride towards their new world record as the @entity144 crowd look on @entity47 ( front ) , @entity45 ( c ) and sir @entity1 ( back ) led from the start and never gave @entity63 the chance to catch them packed out : @entity27 's riders were roared to victory by a vociferous @entity144 crowd this evening questions were raised last night over @entity27 ’s spectacular cycling win after one of the team appeared to claim he had deliberately fallen off in one of the heats			1
the @entity11 team were allowed to restart the qualifier after @entity47 crashed seconds into the race			1
he later helped propel sir @entity1 and @entity45 to two world records and @entity6 gold			1
the 19 - year - old , born in @entity58 , seemed to suggests the crash was part of a deliberate ploy , saying : ‘ we were saying : “ if we have a bad start , we need to crash to get a restart ”			1
i just crashed , i did it on purpose to get a restart , just to have the fastest ride			0
so it was all planned , really			0
’ last night @entity79 said @entity47 ’s comments were ‘ lost in translation ’ from a man who began learning @entity86 only after moving to @entity87 two years ago			1
the @entity294 confirmed the incident had been reviewed at the time and the result was not in question			2
neither silver medallists @entity63 nor @entity58 , who won the bronze , said they would be protesting			2
there is no rule to govern such an incident and no appeal is possible			0
@entity47 later denied the crash was deliberate			1
‘ no , ’ he said , ‘ i just went out the gate and just lost control , just fell down			2
’ @entity1 was in tears as princess @entity311 presented him with a fifth gold of his career , a second for @entity45 and a first for @entity53 , 19 , who competed for @entity58 , the country of his birth , as a junior and joined @entity18 earlier this year , qualifying because his father is @entity11			1
‘ it ’s quite overwhelming , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ we knew it was possible but it ’s easier said than done for everyone to come good on the same day			0
‘ i feel immense pride to be able to do this in @entity184 , this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity and i ca n’t overstate what it means			2
this is the most memorable medal of my career			0
’ he said the crowd and noise had made a ‘ huge ’ difference			0
with the doors closed and the heating turned up , the conditions were said to be ideal for fast riding in the @entity144 , which had been built under the direction of @entity1			2
and he did not disappoint , afterwards milking the applause as @entity340 ’s heroes played and the crowd acclaimed their own @entity18 heroes			2
' now and again rubbish things happen and this is one of those days			0
the only positives i can take is that i know i am in really good form because that was the fastest second lap i have done			0
i just need to get my head down and concentrate on the races to come			0
' i 'm desperately disappointed for @entity154 because she has done an incredible job in getting this far			0
' her team sprint today was the best of her life so far			0
i 've no doubt she will be back in @entity223 and absolutely smashing it			0
