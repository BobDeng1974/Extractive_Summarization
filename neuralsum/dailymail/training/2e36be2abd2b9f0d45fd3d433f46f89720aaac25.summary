by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 26 march 2012 a baby girl proved she was a born fighter when she let out three yelps and lifted her arm - even though she was delivered three months premature			2
@entity4 had stopped growing in her mother ’s womb 15 weeks early , weighed just 1lb 12oz and measured 11 inches from head to toe			1
she was so underdeveloped she spent her first five months fighting for life in an incubator			2
fighter : @entity4 when she was in intensive care			1
she was on and off life support three times during her five month stay in hospital doctors had to battle to restart @entity4 's heart when she was four days old			1
she also suffered a bleed to her brain , was on a ventilator for almost a month and needed three blood transfusions			2
but despite being one of the smallest babies to be born in @entity26 , her incredible actions reassured her worried parents , @entity28 and @entity29 , that their daughter was determined to live			2
now aged 19 months , and against all odds , @entity4 , is like any other happy - go - lucky toddler , who loves being on her feet			1
she still needs oxygen as her lungs continue to develop , but doctors are hopeful she will be off all breathing aids by this summer			2
@entity4 is now learning to walk , talk and explore			1
she still needs oxygen but is expected to be off all breathing aids by this summer mrs @entity4 , 32 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ' we just feel so lucky still to have her			1
' in the beginning we could n’t get past the next hour , then it was the next week and the next month			2
but as time went on and she got bigger we got more confident that she was going to survive			2
' things like her first smile , and even when she started bottle feeding , were all things we thought we would never see			0
' we were too scared to think about it because we did n’t want to get our hopes up , in case something happened			0
' now her laugh is the best thing in the world			0
she ’s such a lovely , happy wee thing			0
' mrs @entity4 , an occupational therapist , had gone to work as normal the day @entity4 was born			1
she had a growth scan that afternoon and was expecting to return to work			0
but doctors discovered @entity4 had stopped growing just 25 weeks into her mother 's pregnancy due to a rare complication and was essentially starving to death			1
so @entity64 was delivered by emergency caesarean section that evening 11 weeks early			1
now : isla with her delighted mother @entity28 and father @entity29			0
they say she is now full of energy mrs @entity4 said : ' it was such a shock			1
@entity4 ’s heart rate dropped and she stopped moving			1
they just needed to get her out of me			0
' it was terrifying because we had no control over the situation			0
' but the first time we got to see her about five hours after she was born , the nurse said , ‘ you ’ve got a feisty one there ‘			0
' if she had n’t had that fight in her , i do n’t think she would be here now			0
' to recognise @entity4 ’s amazing courage and lust for life , she recently received a @entity89 at the @entity90 in @entity91			1
mrs @entity4 and her husband , a courier , were warned not expect their baby to cry when she was born at 29 weeks , as her lungs were so underdeveloped			1
but mrs @entity4 said : ' she let out three little squawks like a cat ’s meow and she opened half and eye and lifted an arm			1
it was quite reassuring , but we never heard her make another noise until weeks after			2
' @entity4 had to be fully ventilated three times during her five months in @entity107 and given steroids to help her lungs mature			1
the first attempt to take her off life support was made when she was four days old			0
but , struggling for breath , she had to be re-ventilated and following complications , @entity4 went into cardiac arrest and doctors had to battle to re-start her heart			1
mrs @entity4 , who had to wait 16 days before she got to hold her newborn , said : ' we were petrified			1
she was just so tiny			0
all your instincts are to protect your child			0
if she cried , i just wanted to pick her up but we could n’t because of all the wires and tubes			0
' she could hardly move her limbs because she had so many needles in them			0
' but mrs @entity4 said when she did eventually get to hug @entity128 , it was the “ best cuddle ever ”			1
' she was inside my top and she just settled down and fell asleep			0
i just sat there with a big grin on my face			0
' @entity29 with daughter @entity4			1
he and wife @entity28 have made a pact ' not to worry about insignificant little things ' when she was born her head was smaller than the palm of her mother ’s hand and from head to toe she measured only the length of a classroom ruler			2
doctors warned @entity143 and mrs @entity4 that because she needed steroids at such a young age and her brain had been starved of oxygen as a result of being on and off the ventilator , there was a chance it would affect her development			1
but against all odds , @entity4 is now learning to walk , talk and explore like any inquisitive toddler			1
' you can see her developing , which is great , ' said mrs @entity4			1
' she is really bright			0
she loves being on her feet , she ’s active and into everything			0
out of all her toys , she ’ll pick out her books			0
' she wakes up smiling and laughing			0
' as a first child she is always going to be special , but even more so now			0
i ca n’t praise the neonatal staff enough			0
they worked so hard and if it was n’t for their care and expertise @entity4 would n’t be here today			2
' mrs @entity4 said she and @entity4 ’s dad have now made a pact ' not to worry about insignificant little things because life is just too precious			2

@entity4 had stopped growing in the womb at 25 weeks and measured just 11 inches long
