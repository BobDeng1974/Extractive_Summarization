@entity0 used her traditional @entity2 broadcast on thursday to call for reconciliation throughout the @entity4 and to praise medical workers fighting @entity6 in @entity7			1
she said it will take time to heal divisions in @entity11 , where a referendum was held this year on whether to remain part of @entity4 , and praised progress resolving the conflict in @entity16			1
@entity0 cited the ' @entity2 truce ' in 1914 as an example to be remembered			1
' something remarkable did happen that @entity2 , exactly 100 years ago today , ' she said			1
' without any instruction or command , the shooting stopped and @entity24 and @entity4 soldiers met in @entity25			1
photographs were taken and gifts exchanged			0
it was a @entity2 truce			1
' that carol is still much - loved today , a legacy of the @entity2 truce , and a reminder to us all that even in the unlikeliest of places hope can still be found , ' the queen said before wishing everyone a happy @entity2			1
the queen writes her own @entity2 speech , which is pre-recorded and televised in many parts of the world			1
she made her first @entity2 broadcast on radio in 1952			1
the queen and her close family celebrated @entity2 at the sprawling @entity34 estate in @entity57			1
prince @entity58 , left , and @entity59 , the @entity60 arrive to attend the @entity4 royal family 's traditional @entity2 church service members of @entity4 's royal family arrive to attend their traditional @entity2 church service at @entity65 in @entity34 , @entity35 the royals attended a church service @entity2 morning before a gala lunch			1
prince @entity58 and his pregnant wife @entity59 were present , but their toddler son , @entity70 , did n't go to church			0
@entity59 told one person in the crowd she did n't bring one - year - old @entity70 because he would have made too much noise			2
prince @entity77 ' wife @entity76 also did n't attend because of a painful back injury suffered earlier this month , officials said			0
the queen arrived by car while the other royals walked from her estate to the village church			0
prince @entity85 leaves joined his royal family at @entity65 in @entity34 , @entity35 prince @entity58 and @entity59 left baby @entity87 at home because he would have been too noisy the @entity0 pictured giving her @entity2 speech the @entity0 's @entity2 broadcast is a traditional feature of the festive season where the head of state can express her thoughts about the past year			1
the @entity0 made her first @entity2 broadcast in 1952 and the annual message was first shown on tv in 1957			1
in that first broadcast she delivered her message live on the radio from her study at @entity34 in @entity57			0
she has delivered one every year except in 1969 , when she decided the royals had been on tv enough after an unprecedented family documentary			2
instead , her greeting took the form of a written address			2
in her 1991 message , the @entity0 silenced rumours of abdication as she pledged to continue to serve			1
she issued a writ against the @entity115 newspaper after it published the full text of her 1992 broadcast two days before transmission			0
she later accepted an apology and a Â£ 200,000 donation to charity			0
the @entity0 's grandfather , @entity121 , delivered the first royal @entity2 broadcast live on the radio from @entity34 in 1932			1
@entity121 was at first unsure about using the relatively untried medium of the wireless , but eventually agreed			0
there was no @entity2 broadcast in 1936 or 1938 , and it was the outbreak of the @entity129 in 1939 that firmly established the tradition			1
the speech is written by the @entity0 herself and each has a strong religious framework , reflects current issues and often draws on her own experiences			1
hundreds of well - wishers lined the route to the church to exchange @entity2 greetings with the royals			1
some shouted with glee as prince @entity85 walked by			0
one visitor from @entity144 told reporters she had asked @entity85 to marry her			0
archbishop of canterbury @entity146 cancelled his @entity2 sermon because of a severe cold			2
in a statement he expressed ' great regret ' about his inability to preach his planned sermon about the true meaning of @entity2			2
church officials said the sermon at @entity157 would instead be delivered by the @entity159 @entity158			0
in the ruins of the old @entity161 is a sculpture of a man and a woman reaching out to embrace each other			0
the sculptor was inspired by the story of a woman who crossed @entity169 on foot after the war to find her husband			0
casts of the same sculpture can be found in @entity175 and @entity176 , and it is simply called reconciliation			2
reconciliation is the peaceful end to conflict , and we were reminded of this in august when countries on both sides of the @entity185 came together to remember in peace			2
the ceramic poppies at the @entity188 drew millions , and the only possible reaction to seeing them and walking among them was silence			0
for every poppy a life ; and a reminder of the grief of loved ones left behind			0
no one who fought in that war is still alive , but we remember their sacrifice and indeed the sacrifice of all those in the armed forces who serve and protect us today			0
in 1914 , many people thought the war would be over by @entity2 , but sadly by then the trenches were dug and the future shape of the war in @entity169 was set			1
but , as we know , something remarkable did happen that @entity2 , exactly a hundred years ago today			2
without any instruction or command , the shooting stopped and @entity24 and @entity4 soldiers met in @entity25			1
photographs were taken and gifts exchanged			0
it was a @entity2 truce			1
truces are not a new idea			0
in the ancient world a truce was declared for the duration of the @entity224 and wars and battles were put on hold			2
@entity228 has a wonderful way of bringing together people and nations , as we saw this year in @entity233 when over 70 countries took part in the @entity236			2
it is no accident that they are known as the @entity240			0
as well as promoting dialogue between nations , the @entity236 pioneered the inclusion of para-sports within each day 's events			2
as with the @entity250 that followed , the courage , determination and talent of the athletes captured our imagination as well as breaking down divisions			0
the benefits of reconciliation were clear to see when i visited @entity175 in june			0
while my tour of the set of @entity260 may have gained most attention , my visit to the @entity257 will remain vividly in my mind			0
what was once a prison during the @entity265 is now a place of hope and fresh purpose ; a reminder of what is possible when people reach out to one another , rather like the couple in the sculpture			0
of course , reconciliation takes different forms			0
in @entity11 after the referendum many felt great disappointment , while others felt great relief ; and bridging these differences will take time			1
bringing reconciliation to war or emergency zones is an even harder task , and i have been deeply touched this year by the selflessness of aid workers and medical volunteers who have gone abroad to help victims of conflict or of diseases like @entity6 , often at great personal risk			1
for me , the life of @entity295 , the @entity295 , whose birth we celebrate today , is an inspiration and an anchor in my life			0
a role model of reconciliation and forgiveness , he stretched out his hands in love , acceptance and healing			2
@entity295 's example has taught me to seek to respect and value all people , of whatever faith or none			0
sometimes it seems that reconciliation stands little chance in the face of war and discord			0
but , as the @entity2 truce a century ago reminds us , peace and goodwill have lasting power in the hearts of men and women			1
on that chilly @entity330 in 1914 many of the @entity24 forces sang @entity37 , its haunting melody inching across the line			1
that carol is still much - loved today , a legacy of the @entity2 truce , and a reminder to us all that even in the unlikeliest of places hope can still be found			1
a very happy @entity2 to you all .			2

@entity339 remembered the @entity2 truce with @entity24 troops in 1914
she also praised medics fighting @entity6 in her annual @entity2 speech
the theme for this year 's address to @entity4 was ' reconciliation '
she said healing differences in @entity11 after referendum would take time
