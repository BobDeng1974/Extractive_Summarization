the £ 522 dress , a silk wrap design by @entity11 designer @entity10 , was subsequently reproduced in the same sapphire shade and went on to sell out again and again on net - a - porter and in @entity13			1
and now , the dress has been offered up to a whole new market - an entirely appropriate one too , given @entity1 's pregnancy - as maternity fashion website @entity18 & child unveils a version of @entity1 's engagement dress tailored especially for pregnant women			0
trendsetter : @entity1 chose to wear a blue @entity3 wrap dress on the event of her engagement announcement in 2010 - and the style was reissued and went on to sell thousands adaptable : @entity30 is selling a maternity version of the @entity3 dress for £ 522 - and the dress has plenty of space to accommodate a growing bump the wrap dress , retailing for £ 522 on @entity40 , is an almost identical take on the original blue @entity3 dress , only the cut allows for a blossoming bump			1
the dress sits alongside a number of similar sapphire blue dresses on @entity48 , as well as other maternity fashion sites such as babes with babies and @entity52 , proving that the @entity54 's fashion influence has touched the world of maternity style too			0
the dress , a plunging v - necked style with soft wrap ties , is a classic @entity3 shape , emblematic of the brand 's easy aesthetic			2
maternity chic : the site is selling the @entity1 dress alongside other @entity3 styles that are suitable to be worn by pregnant women every season @entity10 puts out new takes on this favourite shape and fans of the brand - which include both @entity1 and her sister @entity71 - have an almost insatiable appetite for the style			1
whether a special maternity shape or not , @entity3 's dresses - maternity or otherwise - have long been worn by pregnant women - and are stretchy and comfortable enough to be worn right up to term			0
the ties can be comfortably fixed above the bump , and the fabric is light and cool			0
and the best part ? unlike traditional maternity clothes that can not be worn once the baby arrives , an @entity3 dress will become a wardrobe classic			0
that 's £ 522 well spent .			1
