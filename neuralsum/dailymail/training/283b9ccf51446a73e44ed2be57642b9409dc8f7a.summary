by @entity0 published : 22:33 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 11:57 est , 29 march 2013 under a fierce spring sun in the @entity3 capital of @entity4 , @entity5 , a @entity6 mother of two , queued outside a bank yesterday to discover if she still had a @entity9 to her name			1
the 35 - year - old accountant from @entity12 soon learned the devastating truth			1
she , and her husband , @entity14 , have lost their savings of £ 135,000 ( 160,000 euros ) because of the banking crisis on the @entity19 island			1
‘ our dreams of building a house here in @entity3 , giving a good life in the sunshine to our two young children , have been shattered , ’ said mrs @entity5 , near to tears , after an hour ’s appointment with the manager of the @entity23 , known locally as @entity24			1
‘ when he showed me details of our deposits , they had been stamped with the words : ‘ account blocked ’			1

when the promised bank opening at midday was delayed by half an hour because of a computer glitch , shouts rang out among the increasingly angry people as they pushed towards the doors , guarded by policemen drafted in to stop violence and protect staff			1
on wednesday night , five shipping containers filled with billions of @entity9 are reported to have been flown to @entity3 from @entity60 and delivered to the island ’s central bank to ensure money did not run out			1
a helicopter and police cars guarded the armoured cash convoy , thought to have been sent by the @entity67 , on its way from the airport			1
strict new rules have been imposed to stop a run on @entity3 banks which yesterday opened for the first time since the island ’s economic meltdown started nearly a fortnight ago			1

mrs @entity5 ( not pictured ) and her husband have lost £ 135,000 airports have are now searching passengers and stopping anyone trying to leave the country with more than 1000 euros ( £ 845 ) and daily cash machine withdrawals are limited to 300 euros ( £ 250 )			1
the clampdown , agreed by the @entity86 finance chiefs in exchange for a 10billion euro bailout ( £ 8.5 billion ) to the island has hit mrs @entity5 and other depositors at two banks , @entity24 and the troubled @entity92 , at the heart of the crisis			1
depositors with both banks can keep 100,000 euros ( £ 84,000 ) but will lose all deposits above this amount to finance the island ’s contribution to the rescue deal			1
it is the first time that a bailout condition to a @entity86 country has included the raiding of depositors ’ accounts , a decision that has infuriated the islanders			1
mrs @entity5 put more than 200,000 @entity110 ( £ 168,000 ) in the @entity23 after selling her house in north @entity12 and de-camping to @entity3 a little over a year ago with her husband , and their two children , a son aged four , and daughter of one			1
she has now lost half of this money			1
@entity14 , a research scientist gave up a plum post at an @entity121 university and also put 160,000 euros ( £ 135,000 ) of his savings in the same bank			2
he learned yesterday that he will lose 60,000 euros ( £ 51,000 ) of the money			2
‘ we have not been able to sleep at night with the worry ’ said mrs @entity5 outside the bank yesterday			1
‘ i nod off for ten minutes , then wake up in terror at what has happened to us			2
' the funds we deposited included money given to us as a wedding present by our family and friends			1
‘ we have bought a plot of land in @entity4 and have paid for architects to design a house with a garden , which is a rarity in the capital			2
now we do not have the money to build the house			1
' we will have to stay in our rented three bedroom flat			2
i wish i had never sold my terraced house in @entity12 , which will have gone up in price since			2
‘ @entity14 went to @entity24 two months ago because was worried about rumours that the bank was in trouble			2
he said he wanted to withdraw the money he had brought to @entity3 from @entity6 and send it back to the @entity6 , where he still has an account with a @entity154 bank			2

there were angry scenes at banks across the island yesterday ‘ the @entity24 official sat him down and told him not to worry			2
the official said he had money deposited in the bank too and nothing was at risk			2
he persuaded @entity14 to keep the money there			2
‘ we have worked hard			2
we have saved our money and not taken risks			2
now we will have to start all over again			2
my parents who live in @entity12 and were refugees to @entity6 after the @entity177 invasion of @entity3 in 1974 say this is a ‘ @entity179 ’ that those living here are facing			2
’ like many @entity3 and @entity6 , @entity5 says she was attracted to the @entity23 by a deposit account which offered something called a ‘ monthly step up plan ’			1
this allowed her to withdraw money each month to pay for architect ’s costs and other outgoings as she planned the new house			0
it also offered an enticing interest rate of between 3 and 5 per cent - far higher than the current ones offered in the @entity6			0
rage : thousands of @entity3 protested against the harsh treatment imposed on @entity3			0
the new agreement will see massive savings raids on those who have more than 100,000 euros deposited in banks ‘ the bank was still advertising this “ step up plan ” on the friday two weeks ago that the banks closed at 1.30 and the crisis began , ’ she says with fury			1
in a further cruel twist , @entity5 was told yesterday that a 200,000 euro loan she and @entity14 , who was born in @entity3 , have taken out at the bank to help build their house will still have to be repaid			1
‘ so we can not use some of our “ confiscated ” funds to pay that off , ' she said			0
no , the bank has taken that and we will end up paying for a loan for years for a house that we can not afford to build			1
’ she is just one of hundreds of @entity6 caught up in the @entity3 banking crisis that is threatening financial stability across the world			1
those who have settled on the island last night spoke of their fears that they will not be able to sell their houses ( which had already slumped dramatically in price before the current crisis began ) without making a significant loss			1
many believe that they could n’t now get their money out of the country even if they could get rid of their properties			0
' our dreams of building a house here in @entity3 , giving a good life in the sunshine to our two young children , have been shattered , ' said mrs @entity5 @entity240 , a 67 - year - old retired @entity241 warrant officer , moved to @entity3 five years ago from @entity242 in @entity243 with his wife @entity244			1
they bought a newly - built home in the picturesque village of @entity248 , perched on a hillside above @entity250 where 40 per cent of the inhabitants are @entity6			1
‘ if i sold the house now it would be at a loss			0
but how would we move the money out of @entity3 back to the @entity6 anyway ? ’ he asked			0
‘ we are stuck here			0
i like @entity3 , but the choice of where we spend our retirement years has been taken away from us , just like that			0
’ the @entity262 have an 100,000 euro investment bond lodged with the island ’s @entity264 which has so far avoided the worst of the troubles			0
they had put it in the bank to pay for unexpected medical bills as they grew older			0
however , after the banking crisis blew up two weeks ago they began to worry that their money was not safe			1
like all the others , the bank shut its doors			0
@entity280 did not return @entity240 ’s emails or calls			0
' we have worked hard			0
we have saved our money and not taken risks			0
now we will have to start all over again			0
my parents who live in @entity12 and were refugees to @entity6 after the @entity177 invasion of @entity3 in 1974 say this is a ‘ @entity179 ’ that those living here are facing			0
' he explained : ‘ lots of @entity121 people are frightened now and want to sell up			0
@entity230 are retired people like us			0
' at our time of life we should be enjoying ourselves			0
instead we are worried sick that we are trapped here			0
’ yesterday @entity300 , of @entity302 financial advisors in @entity3 , warned that it is responsible people who carefully invested savings in the island ’s banks who are now being hit by the controversial bailout plan			1
‘ it is ordinary people , both @entity6 and @entity3 , who are paying the price			0
' certainly those in the bank queue , including mrs @entity5 , seemed to prove his point			1
@entity316 a 61 - year - old @entity3 businessman runs a small company importing plastics to the island			0
he had hoped to get permission to pay his suppliers through his @entity24 account			1
cash flow : the ban shut - down hammered businesses , which have been without access to their funds for two weeks ‘ i have not been caught by the 100,000 @entity9 confiscation , but i have not been able to do business for a fortnight because the banks have been shut			0
’ and @entity336 , a 22 - year - old @entity338 football professional playing for a @entity3 club was also waiting patiently			0
‘ i have 30,000 euros in my account here , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to get it out and send it to a bank in the @entity6			0
i am afraid of losing my savings after what has happened			0
‘ for months now the club has not been paying my salary on time			0
i feared the island had financial problems			0
i want to move to @entity12 this summer when my contract is over and take my money with me			0
’ when and how he will ever be able to do so remains to be seen .			0

@entity5 *'s* family has lost the *staggering* sum as a result of @entity358 bailout
