by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the @entity2 was in turmoil last night after its firm opposition to assisted dying began to crumble following the intervention of @entity7 , the former archbishop of canterbury			1
as the @entity2 ’s rejection of the right to die was challenged by more senior @entity12 , @entity2 leaders called for a proposed law change to be delayed so a @entity14 could subject the issue to high - level public debate			1
the argument over assisted dying has joined same - sex marriage and women bishops as key sources of division for @entity12			1
archbishop of canterbury @entity22 , left , warned a proposed new law on assisted dying is ‘ mistaken and dangerous ’ , but his predecessor @entity7 , right , insists it would not be ‘ anti-christian ’ to change the law the debate burst into the open on saturday when @entity7 wrote in the @entity30 that helping someone who is in great pain to die was in keeping with @entity34 belief			1
he said it was not anti-christian to believe terminally ill people should be allowed to die with dignity			1
on the same day , however , the archbishop of @entity39 , @entity22 , said he would oppose a @entity40 to legalise assisted dying put forward by former labour lord chancellor @entity41			1
archbishop @entity22 said it would leave a ‘ sword of damocles ’ hanging over the elderly , putting them under pressure to end their lives			2
yesterday lord @entity7 ’s views were supported by @entity49 , the former archbishop of @entity50 , who said he wanted to focus on ‘ dignity for the dying ’			1
in an article in the @entity54 , he wrote : ‘ i revere the sanctity of life – but not at any cost			0
’ former archbishop @entity49 says he would not like his life to be ' prolonged artificially ' @entity41 ’s @entity59 would require patients to administer the poison themselves			1
it would not help those who are paralysed or lack the capacity to operate a mechanism to inject the drugs			0
existing rules effectively mean no relative or friend will be prosecuted for aiding a suicide if it is done out of compassion and not for gain			0
but they ban @entity74 doctors taking any role in a death			2
@entity41 ’s @entity40 would enable doctors to help a patient die by prescribing deadly drugs if they are terminally ill and expected to die within six months			1
the patient would have to be over 18 and to have lived in @entity81 or @entity82 for at least a year			0
two doctors would have to certify the patient was terminally ill and it was their informed wish to die			1
the patient would also have to signify their consent			0
there would be 14 days before drugs were provided , or six days if death was expected within a month			0
the man described as the ‘ moral conscience of @entity93 ’ condemned as ‘ disgraceful ’ how @entity94 was kept alive by gruelling hospital treatment			0
@entity41 said @entity7 ’s article was ‘ profoundly significant ’ , adding : ‘ it seemed to me to express views held by very many committed @entity12			1
it provided real leadership for the alternative view			0
he made absolutely clear that there is no @entity34 reason to oppose assisted suicide			2
‘ i respect the views of those who oppose			0
the significance of the @entity7 and the @entity108 interventions is that there is nothing anti-christian about supporting assisted dying			1
’ he added that he worried critics of the @entity40 would try to scupper it when it is debated in the @entity114 on friday			2
he told @entity115 : ‘ i fear that somebody may put a wrecking amendment down			0
that finishes it off for that session			0
i am urging all my supporters to come on friday to vote down such a motion			0
’ the @entity122 , the right reverend @entity123 , yesterday became the first serving bishop to back the right to die			2
he said : ‘ i have come to support assisted dying precisely because i do believe strongly in the sanctity of life			1
' part of honouring this is respecting people ’s integrity to make decisions about themselves			2
’ former labour cabinet minister @entity41 is proposing a change in the law to allow someone with less than six months to live to be prescribed a lethal dose by doctors @entity7 said he had dropped his opposition to assisted dying ‘ in the face of the reality of needless suffering ’			1
but on saturday , archbishop @entity22 wrote in @entity141 : ‘ i know of health professionals who are already concerned by the ways in which their clients have suggestions “ to go to @entity147 ” whispered in their ears by relatives weary of caring for them and exasperated by seeing their inheritances dwindle through care costs			2
’ senior cofe figures have now called for a @entity14			2
the @entity154 , the right reverend @entity155 , urged @entity41 to withdraw his @entity40 to make way for such a commission , adding : ‘ we were surprised by the content of @entity7 ’s article , but ... it has brought the issues to the forefront of public discussion			1
’ about right : sir @entity165 is backing the bill sir @entity165 , the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic , yesterday gave his backing to @entity41 ’s @entity59			1
he believes the proposals are ‘ about right ’ and in tune with public opinion			0
and he said the @entity41 law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution and career disaster			1
‘ they would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance			0
’ sir @entity165 made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s			1
he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications			0
he told the @entity192 programme on @entity193 that the decision to end one ’s life ‘ must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well ’			0
‘ i would n’t dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me , ’ he said			0
the @entity41 proposals were ‘ about right , given the range of public opinion on this issue ’			2
alternatives were ‘ bleak ’			0
‘ i would be far better if i could have my death assisted in a peaceful , dignified way so that my suffering was n’t prolonged			0
