by @entity1 reporter audio recordings of the ' ping ' signals believed to have come from the black box of @entity6 will now not be released as doubt grows over whether they are connected with the missing plane			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) headed by @entity11 told the @entity12 that the search group 's original confidence the four accoustic ' ping ' signals were from the plane had waned and the recordings would not be made public			1
' the recordings of the detections will not be released at this point in time , ' the @entity10 said			0
' we continue to pursue this lead to either discount or confirm the area of the detections as the final resting place of @entity6			2
a group of families called @entity53 released a statement saying , ' we implore the @entity57 government to share and release the raw @entity59 satellite engine ping data for @entity6 ( every ping from friday , march 7 12:00 until the final signal was received globally ) so that it can be subject to broader analysis by relevant experts			1
this is a departure from @entity65 @entity11 's certainty last month that the ping recordings were potentially from the missing plane			2
the pings detected by the @entity70 defence vessel @entity71 's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern @entity75 may now not be released the towed pinger locator ( @entity77 - 25 ) on the deck of the @entity79 detected two signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder , but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with @entity6 mr @entity11 said a possible fifth ping detected by a surveillance plane conducting an accoustic search had the potential of being from a man - made source , although it required further detailed analysis			1
the @entity70 @entity92 based at @entity93 in @entity94 , on the @entity96 coast south of @entity97 , had concluded that two pings detected by the ship @entity71 â€™s towed - pinger locater on april 5 and april 8 were from a source that was not of ' natural origin ' and was ' likely sourced ' from specific electronic equipment			0
at the time , @entity105 captain @entity104 said the it was ' certainly a man - made device emitting that signal and i have no explanation for what other component could be there '			0
' i 'm an engineer so i do n't talk emotions too much			0
but certainly when i received word that they had another detection , you feel elated			0
' you 're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved			0
' @entity122 confidence of @entity124 commodore @entity123 ( pictured , right , with search chief @entity11 last month ) of the recorded pings being from missing @entity6 has now waned			1

the ' ping ' signals recorded in missing @entity6 search will not be released
search headed by @entity11 now uncertain pings came from plane
decision a blow to families who have pleaded for public analysis of pings
