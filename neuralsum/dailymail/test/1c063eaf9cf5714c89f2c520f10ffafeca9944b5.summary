' cool ' credentials : this week @entity1 revealed her love of alternative group @entity3 she rarely misses a chance to demonstrate her ‘ cool ’ credentials			1
and this week @entity1 was at it again , revealing her love of alternative group @entity3			1
but their brand of psychedelic rock conjures up a world a far cry from her life in @entity13 and the @entity14			2
the @entity16 band – whose name roughly translates as ‘ policy ’ in @entity20 – are inspired by a radical feminist who described pregnancy as ‘ barbaric ’ , and their songs feature violent imagery			1
the video for the first single on the group ’s most recent album depicts androgynous - looking singer @entity3 subjecting her trussed - up alter ego to a violent assault			1
blood spurts in all directions as she smashes her hands with a hammer , punches her in the face and finally waterboards her			0
another unsettling song by the four - piece band from @entity41 , entitled leading to @entity42 , includes the lyric ‘ i dream of you , oh my strangler ’			2
miss @entity47 , 33 , has described her music as ‘ rhythm - driven sex noise ’ and says the digital effects she uses to modify her broken - hearted vocals are ‘ like taking drugs for your voice ’			0
her marriage broke up several years ago after she had a child , and her lyrics have a tendency towards violent , sexual imagery that bemoans ‘ boys ’ and ‘ all the work they require ’			0
mrs @entity1 , 43 , pictured , comes from an aristocratic background and was educated at @entity64 , whose other alumni include the @entity66 and @entity67			1
but she has a distinctly bohemian streak and was friends with @entity71 trip - hop artist @entity70 during her time at university			0

the record ’s cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman , her hair and neck caked in blood			0
the title is a tribute to @entity105 - born feminist @entity104 , whom miss @entity47 has described as a ‘ mentor and muse from the grave ’			1
miss @entity104 , who died in 2012 aged 67 , painted a radical vision of a ‘ liberated ’ world without families , childbirth or any real distinctions between men and women			2
she is best known for her 1970 manifesto @entity116 : the @entity117 , which drew inspiration from @entity120 ’s @entity119			0
miss @entity104 argued that pregnancy was ‘ barbaric ’ and childhood was a ‘ supervised nightmare ’			2
@entity3 's record cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman , her hair and neck caked in blood			1
the title is a tribute to @entity105 - born feminist @entity104 ( above ) she looked forward to a new world in which women were to be liberated from men thanks to the scientific breakthroughs which meant that sexual reproduction could happen outside the womb			1
the radical feminist was also responsible for stunts including unfurling a ‘ @entity141 ’ banner at a beauty pageant			0
