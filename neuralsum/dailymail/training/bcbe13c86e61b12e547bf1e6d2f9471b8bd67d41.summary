by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 20:55 est , 20 november 2013 it 's not @entity2 ! @entity3 corrected students this week on @entity5 , confusing the @entity7 music with a @entity9 plainsong his withering put - downs have humiliated @entity5 contestants for years			1
but @entity3 was finally forced to sample a taste his own medicine after the programme this week , when viewers pulled him up on a series of errors			1
the presenter fell short of his own high standards on the @entity21 show on monday			1
his first gaffe came when a team from @entity24 were asked to name the @entity7 composer of a piece of music as a bonus question			2
after they wrongly guessed @entity30 , @entity3 quickly corrected them , saying : ‘ no , it ’s @entity33 in b flat minor			1
’ but it was not long before music experts pointed out the clip was actually a @entity9 plainchant and not the work of @entity2			2
one viewer , @entity40 – a senior producer for the @entity41 and @entity42 – tweeted : ‘ appalled at the ignorance of question on # universitychallenge			0
’ another , @entity47 , wrote : ‘ did # universitychallenge just play a requiem plainsong and ask which composer it was by ? ’ he added : ‘ some work to do on their musical knowledge			0
’ and a third , @entity59 tweeted : ‘ err … was there a mistake with the music question about @entity2 ’s requiem on university challenge ? ’ @entity3 ’s second blunder came when @entity24 were asked to identify the missing sister from @entity64 ’s novel @entity62			1
the @entity24 team responded ‘ @entity67 ’ but @entity3 soon told them that they had got the answer wrong			1
the question was then handed over to their rivals , @entity69 , whose answer ‘ @entity67 ’ was accepted			0
one viewer , @entity82 , said : ‘ i remain unsure how @entity69 got to answer the @entity64 bonuses			0
on the starter question , @entity24 identified “ @entity67 ” as the missing sister			0
and lo and behold , 22 times in @entity62 that sister is referred to as “ @entity67 ”			0
however the answer was deemed to be incorrect while “ @entity67 ” was accepted			2
’ another added : ‘ i was a bit surprised that @entity91 did n’t accept @entity67 as correct			0
’ despite the blunders , @entity24 went on to beat their rivals and land a place in the quarter - finals of the tv quiz			0
a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ the excerpt that we played was not composed by @entity2 himself			1
‘ we apologise to both teams and viewers and are grateful to those who pointed this out			0
fortunately this error has not changed the outcome of the programme			1
’ the blunder is not the first time the experienced host has been spotted getting things wrong			0
last month , @entity3 was accused of making another error when he scathingly corrected a contestant who said a recording of @entity115 from the musical @entity116 ! featured @entity117			1
some thought @entity3 was wrong to deliver such a withering put - down , as the actor had played the role in another production .			2

after years of *sneering* at incorrect answers @entity3 *offered* one himself
@entity21 apologises after error but says mistake did not change the outcome
