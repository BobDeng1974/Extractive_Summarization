@entity1 will notify owners of the recall , which involves 867,795 vehicles			1
replacement : the company said in a statement @entity7 and @entity49 , model years 2011 - 2014 , were under inspection and brake boosters would be replaced wherever necessary when @entity1 first became aware of a problem last spring , it concluded vehicles would still meet federal standards and began adding a coating to new parts			1
