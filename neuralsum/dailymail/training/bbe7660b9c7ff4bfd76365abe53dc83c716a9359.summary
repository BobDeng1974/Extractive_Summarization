air pollution inside the home is putting people at risk of developing heart disease , cancer and breathing problems , experts have today warned			1
@entity8 , which affects around 15.3 million houses in the @entity10 , is where a person 's health deteriorates because of the air circulating in their home			1
scientists have warned simple day - today tasks , such as doing the washing or cooking dinner , could be putting families at risk of cardiovascular disease , lung cancer and asthma			1
@entity26 circulating inside contains more than 900 chemicals , particles and biological materials with potential health effects			1
@entity32 spores , pollen , radon , carbon monoxide and dander all lurk within homes , seeping through cracks in walls and floorboards , brought in on clothing or produced by wood burners , gas hobs and detergents used in cleaning			1
while more severe symptoms include eye irritation , rashes , muscle pain , respiratory problems , asthma , fever or chills , hearing loss , nose bleeds , wheezing and lung disease			2
the @entity57 , @entity57 infographic reveals from top to bottom , the key danger points in every home			0
the @entity93 states everyone has an uncompromised right to a healthy living environment			0
but air pollution is estimated to be the leading cause of environmental burden of disease in @entity100			1
experts have called for people to ensure their homes are properly ventilated and urged the authorities to make it mandatory for new builds to come with a ' @entity106 ' , indicating a good ventilation system is installed			1
is where a person 's health deteriorates as a result of the air circulating in their home			1
the condition affects more than 15.3 million homes across the @entity10 , experts believe			1
professor @entity117 , who specialises in allergy and respiratory medicine at @entity120 , called for increased awareness of what is being termed ' @entity8 '			1
' @entity8 occurs when individuals and families are exposed to a potent mix of airborne pollutants within the home arising from poor ventilation , causing respiratory and skin diseases to occur more frequently , ' he said			1
a pan-european study , carried out by the @entity132 , revealed the impact indoor allergens has on disease and life expectancy			0
researchers confirmed a link between indoor exposure to pollutants and cardiovascular disease			0
the annual burden of disease caused by inadequate indoor air quality is estimated to correspond a loss of more than two million healthy life years in the @entity146			2
the researchers found pollutants in the home increase the burden of disease			2
more than 15.3 million homes in the @entity10 are at risk of @entity8 , where a person 's health deteriorates because of the air circulating in their home fifty - seven per cent of the total burden relates to cardiovascular diseases , 23 per cent to lung cancer , 12 per cent to asthma and the remaining eight per cent is linked to other respiratory conditions			1
ventilate make sure you have effective ventilation throughout your home			0
use eco friendly products less toxins and pollutants are found in eco-friendly products , making the air fresher and cleaner 3			0
roll with it opt for roll on deodorant and beauty products rather than aerosol cans 4			0
choose wood flooring carpets harbour dust , dust mites , pet hair , fungus and other harmful particles 5			0
unplug switch off your technology when you 've finished using them 6			0
take your shoes off shoes can carry pollen , dirt and soil from outside , spreading it through your home 7			2
get it tested you can make sure your home is radon free by getting a test 8			2
watch paint dry ensure paint has dried compleletly before using a newly painted room 9 crack it open dry your washing outside , if possible			0
if not , make sure you open the windows 10			0
time for a change ensure shower curtains are changed regularly and avoid ones made from vinyl , because the material harbours water and creates mould the researchers suggest a change in the way homes in @entity100 are ventilated could reduce the overall burden of disease , by around 38 per cent			1
professor @entity117 , said : ' many people associate indoor air quality with more innocuous conditions such as eczema or asthma , however , i have seen many patients with serious health conditions due to pollutants within the home and the risk of cardiovascular disease should not be dismissed			1
' with respect to asthma , mould allergy is recognised to be associated with worse asthma and poorer asthma control			0
' the presence of moulds within the home is a reflection of poor ventilation and increased humidity			0
' homes with mould are also likely to have higher house dust mite allergen levels and this may worsen both respiratory and skin conditions			2
' the lack of adequate ventilation within the home can also be associated with the build up of non-allergenic noxious fumes which are detrimental to health			2
' he urged people to assess the systems they have in their homes , and called for new homes to come with a ' @entity106 ' , as an indication of good ventilation			2
' i advise my patients to prioritise good household ventilation – assess the systems your home has in place and look to update them if they are faulty or out of date , ' he told @entity265			0
' i would also like to see a ' @entity106 ' on new homes to confirm that they have mechanical ventilation systems with effective heat exchange installed – to help reduce the health risks for future generations			2
' currently , just two per cent of the @entity10 has mechanical ventilation systems installed throughout their home ; which is concerning given this data , professor @entity117 added			0
' if people are exposed to high concentrations of pollutants over long periods of time , even non-chemically sensitive individuals can be susceptible to the associated serious health risks , ' he said			2

around 81 per cent of people are at risk of suffering a respiratory or dermatological condition because of poor indoor air quality			1
fifty - eight per cent of people have experienced mould or condensation in their homes , increasing to 70 per cent among 25 to 34 year olds			1
mould spores , released in the atmosphere by damp spots on the walls , window frames and decaying foods are among the most common biological pollutants			1
the increasing prevalence of dampness in homes has caused a rise in mould levels , which in turn increase people 's susceptibility to asthma and allergies			1
pollen can also be a pollutant in the home , usually brought inside when windows are left open or people walk through the house with shoes they have worn outside			1
meanwhile dander are tiny particles , which come from feathers , skin or hair and can also cause allergies			0
volatile organic compounds , found in everyday cleaning products , can trigger asthma			0
they are commonly found in air fresheners , carpet cleaners , polish and oven cleaners			0
as well as biological pollutants and @entity347 , there are a number of different gases , which are common within the home			0
@entity351 is a natural radioactive gas , that comes from the soil			0
it can seep into the home through cracks in solid floors , construction joints , cracks in walls , gaps around pipes and the water supply			0
@entity364 , a common allergen , is often brought into the home on people 's clothes and shoes , aggravating respiratory problems carbon monoxide is another gas common in the home			1
it has no odour or colour and can have serious effects on health			0
it is highly toxic and is thought to cause around 50 accidental deaths a year in @entity381 and @entity382			0
carbon monoxide can enter the home through cooking , heating , from outside , clogged chimneys , wood burning , incense burning , cigarette smoke and burning candles			1
building materials stored in the home , paint for example , can contain chemicals including lead and formaldehyde , which are known to cause breathing difficulties , increased blood pressure and joint pain .			2

@entity8 is where a person 's health deteriorates because of the air in their home - increasing the risk of cancer and heart disease
@entity26 inside contains more than 900 potentially harmful chemicals
mould spores , pollen , radon , carbon monoxide and dander are to blame
experts warn people must ensure their homes are properly ventilated
