@entity0 has been ‘ humiliated ’ by @entity1 , according to his agent			1
the @entity4 forward has been made to train with the reserves this summer and did not join @entity7 ’s squad on this month ’s tour of @entity9			1
@entity0 fell out with the @entity1 management team towards the end of last season and is not part of their plans entering the new campaign			1
au revoir : @entity0 agent says the player feels ' humiliated ' by his exile at @entity1 he was fined on his return to training last month for allegedly being 1.5kg overweight , although he will appeal against that sanction			1
@entity0 has one year to run on his current deal and , while he would prefer a return to @entity4 with @entity26 , he could also run down the remainder of his contract in the reserves			1
the 27 - year - old ’s representative , @entity30 , said : ‘ we do n’t know what the problem is			1
@entity7 in the past has said @entity0 was extraordinary			1
lonely : @entity0 has trained with @entity1 's reserves this summer after falling out with management ‘ @entity0 has done everything for @entity1 , every effort has been made to discuss the problem			1
we are in a situation where there does n’t seem to be a solution			0
‘ he is simply doing his job : he trains well , he enjoys training with the reserves where he has a great coach in @entity47			0
’ he went on : ‘ it ’s unfair and humiliating			0
we will challenge the fine			0
we asked @entity1 to give us the player ’s physical records			2
‘ @entity0 went on vacation with a personal trainer , he has worked to prepare for this season			2
that 1.5 kg ? yes , it is a pound of muscle and 500 grams of fat			0
‘ he lost 2 per cent body fat			0
we therefore challenge the fine			0
’ @entity0 could even play a waiting game and @entity30 says @entity7 could well be gone before his player			1
‘ @entity0 does n’t have to leave , ’ he told @entity61			2
happier times : @entity0 's ( left ) soured relationship with @entity7 ( right ) has seen him frozen out ‘ he can go on a free after his contract is over – six months , or a year , this is not a problem			1
who knows how long @entity7 will be at @entity1			2
in two months , he may not be here			0
@entity0 love this club , he is idolised by fans			0
‘ @entity0 will remain professional and is working hard			0
he prefers a return to @entity26 , but it is not economically feasible			2
@entity26 is his first club , so there is a level of attachment			0
‘ however , for me , it is very difficult financially – @entity1 want a lot of money for @entity0			2
