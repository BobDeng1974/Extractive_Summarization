@entity2 was born in @entity27 to @entity6 parents and plays as an attacking midfielder			1
he began his career at @entity17 in @entity31 and soon drew attention from scouts at @entity20 , @entity34 and @entity21			1
however , a personal visit from sir @entity36 ensured he chose @entity0 and he signed for the club on turning 16			1

i asked him to do his job without telling me anything , to keep my focus on the pitch			2
@entity62 told me to stay calm			2
he wants to give me a chance because i have plenty of talent			2
when he arrived at the club , i talked with him			2
' @entity2 has failed to progress since though with @entity0 well covered in his position at first - team level and he is ready to leave			1
there are similarities to the situation preceding @entity73 's departure to @entity74 but @entity0 are unable to offer guarantees and @entity2 and his father , former midfielder @entity76 , will weigh up offers from other clubs			1
@entity21 have offered @entity79 to @entity80 again as they continue discussions over the £ 26.8million transfer of @entity83			1

@entity111 were pushing for £ 7m in january but are now leaning towards allowing him to see out his deal			1
@entity85 delegates are in @entity86 discussing the £ 23m departure of @entity88 with his father @entity89 @entity124 is currently on trial at @entity126 @entity126 have extended the trial of @entity129 centre back @entity124			1
the 26 - year - old spent last week training with @entity132 's first - team squad and impressed the coaching staff enough to be invited to stay for another week			0
@entity124 , who has been capped once by @entity134 , is 6ft 4in tall and decent on the ball			0
he now hopes to do well enough to earn a contract			0
@entity126 are hopeful of signing @entity137 from @entity0			1
the 30 - year - old is keen on a move to @entity140 but they have so far failed to get rid of the players they need to accommodate @entity137 on the wage bill			2
a @entity126 deal for @entity146 's 20 - year - old left - back @entity145 is also still possible			0

@entity148 manager @entity147 has asked about the availability of @entity150 from @entity151 winger @entity162 and 19 - year - old @entity150 have been watched before by @entity148 staff as well as talented forward @entity164			1
@entity165 are reluctant to allow @entity162 to move to @entity166 just yet and have also fielded interest from @entity114			2
asked afterwards if he had any interest in signing @entity162 and @entity150 on loan during this transfer window , he told @entity173 radio station @entity172 : ' they are two options			0
' @entity148 's more expensive option is @entity117 's @entity176			0

however , the other notable performance on sunday came from @entity192 the defensive midfielder who has been on @entity20 's wishlist for the past two seasons			0
the @entity195 international , 25 , has been a key figure in @entity179 's rise to the top of @entity200			0

they have plenty of interest in @entity219 but the striker is still intent on seeing the season out and taking stock of his situation in the summer			0
@entity219 has offers from @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity166 with @entity188 one of the clubs to have shown an interest as they consider their homegrown quota			0
a number of clubs have expressed an interest in @entity211 striker @entity219 , in action against @entity235 @entity211 would still be able to gain £ 3m compensation and that is worth the gamble if @entity219 ' goals between now and the summer keep them in the @entity213			2
@entity117 would like to freshen up their attack but would prefer to sell a player first before bringing @entity219 in			0

it is no flash in the pan either as his statistics prove			0
he has been consistent throughout his career with a record of 154 goals in 172 starts in all competitions for @entity272 and @entity253 , a goal every 99.8 minutes			0
@entity274 and @entity275 are also showing an interest as @entity253 brace themselves for offers			0
@entity235 have offered £ 3.5m for @entity278 at @entity279 but will have to offer closer to £ 6m to tempt owners @entity281 's to sell			1
