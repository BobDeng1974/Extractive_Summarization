today around the world fireworks will be ringing in the new year as people celebrate the beginning of 2015			2
but in a week the solar system will put on a light show of its own , when a comet passes close to @entity8 ’s orbit			1
in fact , comet @entity9 will come so close that it will be visible to the naked eye - but you 'll want to get a look at it soon , as it wo n’t return again for 8,000 years			1
on 7 january 2015 comet @entity23 ( @entity9 ) , pictured by astronomer @entity24 on 28 dec , will make its closest approach to @entity8			1
it will be visible to observers on @entity8 near the constellation of @entity28 the comet , formally designated @entity29 ( @entity9 ) , was discovered by amateur astronomer @entity9 from @entity31 , @entity32			1
on 7 january 2015 it will make its closest approach to @entity8 at a distance of 43.6 million miles ( 70.2 million km ) - although it is already visible in the night sky			1
it will make its closest approach to the sun on 30 january at a distance of 1.29 @entity39 ( one astronomical unit - @entity39 - is the distance from @entity8 to the sun ) before heading back out of the solar system			1
the remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of @entity28 according to @entity45 's @entity44 , which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky			1
it will then make its way past the @entity50 and the @entity52 constellations			0
the comet 's position in the sky can be tracked on various websites such as @entity57			0
in photos of the comet taken so far it appears green , which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight			1
astronomer @entity65 from @entity66 explains how to spot the comet in the night sky : ' @entity69 ( @entity23 ) is growing in brightness and will hit a magnitude of +4.1 in the first two weeks of the new year			2
' a magnitude of +4.1 is just over 100 times dimmer than the brightest star in @entity8 's entire night time sky ( @entity75 )			0
the more positive the number , the lower the magnitude and the dimmer an object is			0
' the comet is currently at a magnitude of around +5.0 , meaning that it is an ideal target for those who have received a telescope or pair of binoculars for @entity85			0
' the comet is much more favourable for @entity21 observers			0
it was a @entity89 target , but it 's leaving their skies now			0
to observe it , late evening is best , around 10.30pm gmt. ' it 's climbing higher and higher in the sky as the nights go on , so by 5 january , you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark			0
' ' even in a pair of 10x50 binoculars and under moderate suburban light pollution , comet @entity9 appears as a faint , white smudge			2
if conditions are much more favourable however , you should be able to make out a bit of shape to the comet , particularly at the centre - albeit only just ! ' again , the darker the skies and the better your optical aid , the more you will see			0
you may even be able to pick out the stunning greenish tint of the comet , but astrophotography will make this much more apparent			0
' @entity69 is close to the southern section of the constellation @entity116 ( @entity118 ) and will begin to make its way through the constellation of @entity121 as we head into the new year			0
' by 5 january , the comet will be higher in the sky and , despite a full moon in the constellation @entity127 ( @entity128 ) , will be easily identifiable to the right of the brightest star in the constellation @entity28 , @entity132			1
' tonight , a waxing gibbous moon will make its appearance , providing a degree of interference in observing the comet			0
however , using a decent pair of binoculars with a magnification of at least 10x50 combined with a southern horizon that ’s free of light pollution will provide an ideal opportunity to catch the comet			0
the comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign			1
in this instance with the comet , it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon , which both glow green			0
to the naked eye , though , the comet will appear grey ; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration			1
the comet is particularly interesting because it is a long period comet - one that originates in the most outer reaches of the solar system , the @entity167 cloud			2
here , icy remnants of the young solar system orbit in a vast cloud , occasionally make long journeys into the inner solar system			2
on rare occasions these comets are visible from @entity8 , like @entity9 will be , before heading back out on extremely long orbits			2
video courtesy of @entity177 on 7 january 2015 it will make its closest approach to @entity8 at a distance of 43.6 million miles ( 70.2 million km ) , shown in this illustration			1
the comet is actually approaching from ' below ' @entity8 's orbital plane , though , so in this @entity186 image it looks like it is not actually at its closest point - but it is in photos of the comet taken so far it appears green , which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight			1
to the naked eye , though , the comet will appear grey ; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration			1
it is pictured here by astronomer @entity205 on 27 december this one , for instance , has an orbital period of 8,000 years - so it wo n’t return until about 10015 ad , if anyone is still around to see it			1
its orbit takes it out to a distance of about 90 billion kilometres ( 56 billion miles ) - more than 20 times the distance of the sun to @entity217			0
its orbital period was actually originally longer , about 11,500 years , but gravitational effects from the planets have shortened its orbit			0
the remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of @entity28 , seen here , which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky			2
it will then make its way past the @entity50 and the @entity52 constellations before beginning its journey back out of the solar system the comet is seen here in a picture by astronomer @entity233			1
the comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign			1
in this instance with the comet , it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon , which both glow green the comet was first discovered by mr @entity9 on 17 august this year			1
initially , it had n’t been expected to get very bright but , as it approached the sun it began to brighten considerably as the sun melted its icy surface			0
and if the name ‘ @entity69 ’ rings a bell , that ’s because mr @entity9 has discovered four similar comets before			0
one of the most famous was @entity256 / 2011 @entity255 ( @entity9 ) , which made a close approach to @entity8 in 2011 and was observed by many observers - even astronauts on the @entity259 - above @entity8			2
@entity259 commander @entity260 captured spectacular imagery of 2011 's comet @entity262 ( @entity9 ) from about 240 miles ( 384km ) above @entity8 ’s horizon on 21 december 2011			2
@entity260 described seeing the comet as ' the most amazing thing i have ever seen in space '			0

people in the @entity20 and elsewhere in the @entity21 will be treated to a cosmic light show early in the new year
on 7 january 2015 comet @entity23 ( @entity9 ) will make its closest approach to @entity8
it will be visible to observes on @entity8 near the constellation of @entity28
and it will be bright enough that people can see it with the naked eye
in photos of the comet taken so far it appears green , which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight
the comet is the fifth discovered by amateur astronomer @entity9 from @entity31 , @entity32
it comes from the edge of the solar system and wo *n't* return for 8,000 years
