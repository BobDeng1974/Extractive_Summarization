by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:50 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 10:54 est , 22 september 2012 supermodel @entity2 went on the offensive against @entity4 on saturday , claiming that the air carrier first killed her two - year - old golden retriever , and then lied about investigating her death			1
@entity2 said she and her husband were flying from @entity9 across the country to @entity11 two weeks ago , and they brought their two beloved pets along for the flight			2
in an interview with @entity17 , the model insisted that the two - year - old @entity18 was in perfect health when they placed her in the crate in the underbelly of the plane			1
killed : @entity18 , a two - year - old golden retriever died earlier this month from heatstroke , according to a veterinarian 's report , suffered while travelling on a @entity4 flight but when the couple went to retrieve the pooch along with their other dog upon arrival in @entity11 , they were told matter - of - factly by airline officials that @entity18 was dead			1
to add insult to injury , @entity2 told @entity39 that @entity4 then lied to her , saying that they sent @entity18 to a veterinary to perform a necropsy in order to determine the cause of death			1
but the outraged pet owner said that never happened , and the dead dog was left languishing in her crate			2
attack : @entity18 's owner is model @entity2 , who blasted the airline over her pet 's death ' i am so saddened by the complete lack of competence , honestly and compassion that @entity4 has shown , ' @entity2 stated			1
@entity4 was not immediately available for comment on the allegations			2
@entity18 was healthy and prepared for her flight across the country , according to the doting dog owner who says she took every precaution to ensure the dog 's safety			1
so when the model , her husband @entity69 and their 10 - month - old son @entity70 landed in @entity11 from @entity9 earlier this month , the last thing they expected to hear was that one of their two dogs did n't make it			2
' we drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hangar were told simply , “ one of them is dead ” by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages , ' @entity2 wrote in a heated web post on thursday titled : ' @entity4 killed our golden retriever			2
' having heard stories of pets not surviving flights before - though @entity18 and her other two dogs @entity90 and @entity91 have flown previously - the nervous owner says she took every precaution her and her husband could think of to ensure their safety , including a full health examination four days before , as required by @entity4 's @entity100 flight program			1
after a six - hour drive to @entity9 to avoid a connecting flight that could potentially stress or separate their dogs , she says she paid the airline $ 1,800 in addition to their plane tickets to ensure their pets ' safety as passengers			1
however , it seems that the airline failed to keep its promises about the dogs			0
' [ the airline ] did n't even have an excuse , ' she told @entity119 this week			0
after retrieving their dog 's body , which they were originally told had already been sent to a local vet for an autopsy , @entity2 ’s own veterinarian determined that @entity18 had died from heatstroke			1
‘ she died 30 feet below us , alone and scared			0
nobody was there to help her because someone made a mistake , ’ @entity2 told people of the dog that had been given to the couple at their wedding in 2010			2
healthy and loved : the golden retriever , seen cuddling with @entity2 's husband @entity69 , had undergone a health inspection just four days before their flight from @entity9 to @entity11 , @entity142 family : @entity18 was one of three dogs belonging to the couple , @entity90 and @entity91 pictured with them , after gifted at their wedding in 2010 ' we understand that the loss of a beloved pet is difficult and express our condolences to ms @entity2 and her family for their loss , ’ @entity4 told people in a statement			1
' after careful review , we found there were no mechanical operational issues with @entity18 's flight and also determined she was in a temperature - controlled environment for her entire journey			1
we would like [ to ] finalize the review but are unable until we receive a copy of the necropsy			0
’ ' i am disappointed by @entity4 's statement and continued show of disrespect , ' @entity2 retorted in her own written statement on her @entity171 page on thursday			1
despite her anger the model , married to an @entity174 heir , writes that she does n't plan to file a lawsuit or become an advocate against the airline			0
@entity179 warning : @entity18 is seen snoozing in @entity2 's home in an earlier taken photo , with the heartbroken owner now warning pet owners about flying with their pets ' i am writing this to help make people aware that airlines are incapable of ensuring the safety of our pets			2
all it takes is for one employee to not follow the proper procedure and then like me , your dog is dead			0
' responding to condolences on her @entity171 page this week , @entity2 showed her appreciation for her compassionate friends and fans			0
' thank you for the kind thoughts			0
she was an amazing dog with a heart of gold			0
so incredibly happy and sweet , so lovable			0
we still can not believe she is gone			0
she will be missed more then i can express			0
my heart is broken and forever changed			0
