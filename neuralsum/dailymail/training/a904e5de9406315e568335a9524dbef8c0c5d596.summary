the reclusive astronaut decided to open his heart about the mission to an unusual source - an @entity17 accountancy magazine			1
the 82 - year - old has only granted a handful of interviews since his 1969 mission			1
when asked about the conspiracy theories , @entity1 laughed and said that there 's no way the 800,000 @entity25 staff working on the project could have kept a secret			1
‘ people love conspiracy theories , they 're very attractive , ’ he said			1
‘ but they were never a concern to me , because i know someone is going to fly back up there and pick up the camera i left there			0
’ conspiracy theorists claim the landings were staged as a propaganda effort for the @entity41 government , and that landing on the moon would have been impossible with 1969 technology			2
the @entity44 of @entity17 convinced him to film an hour - long one - on - one in which he talks about the landing and his famous first steps on the moon			2
‘ a month before the launch of @entity53 , we decided we were confident enough we could try and attempt ... a descent to the surface , @entity50 said @entity1 in the video which appeared on the @entity44 website this week after the interview last year			0
‘ i thought we had a 90 percent chance of getting back safely to @entity60 on that flight but only a 50 - 50 chance of making a landing on that first attempt			1
’ as a child , @entity1 said he had ‘ become fascinated with the world of flight , as an elementary school student , and determined that , somehow , i wanted to be involved in that			0

it is sad that we are turning the programme in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation and stimulation that it will provide to young people			0
’ @entity44 head @entity104 said he suggested the idea of an interview to the space veteran when he was in @entity17 last year helping the organisation with its 125th anniversary , and he agreed			0
‘ i know something not a lot of people know about @entity1 -- his dad was an auditor , ’ @entity104 said			0
