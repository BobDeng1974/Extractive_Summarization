' the book was doing well and this encouraged me to keep developing my work , it was around thistime i had the idea for @entity34			1
the curved 8.5ft - long games table in bright yellow adds a unique new dimension to the game ' the idea came to me in a matter of minutes on the train ; i have the page in my notebook where @entity44 of lucidly scribbled it down			1
