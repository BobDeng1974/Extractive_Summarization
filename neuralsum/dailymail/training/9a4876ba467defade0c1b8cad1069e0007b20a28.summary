by @entity1 reporter published : 10:02 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 19:06 est , 9 december 2012 sir @entity2 last night attacked an advert for @entity4 that appears to make light of rape			1
the online advert shows a man standing behind a woman and covering her eyes with his hand before giving her a small present			2
the caption reads : ‘ the gift of @entity16 surprise			0
necklace ? or chloroform ? ’ the advert provoked a furious reaction from @entity21 users , who described it as ‘ disgusting ’ and ‘ totally unacceptable ’			0
joke : the advert featured a picture of a man behind a woman with his hand in front of her eyes , giving her a small red box , and the caption read : ' the gift of @entity16 surprise			0
necklace ? or chloroform ? ' @entity33 founder sir @entity2 , 62 , wrote on his blog : ‘ having just seen , for the first time , the @entity4 advert which has upset many today , i agree it is ill - judged			1
‘ although i do n’t own the company [ it is owned by a @entity42 firm , @entity41 ] , it carries our brand			2
‘ i will speak to the team there , make my thoughts clear and see what can be done about it			2
’ he later added : ‘ they acknowledge a dreadful mistake was made			1
the advert will be withdrawn within the hour , never to be seen again			0
’ sir @entity2 - a father - of - two who was born in 1950 , founded @entity4 in 1970 and has a net worth of £ 2.6billion - admitted to his 2.7million followers on @entity21 that the advert was ' pretty ill - judged '			1
acknowledgement : sir @entity2 wrote on his blog on the @entity33 website : ' having just seen , for the first time , the @entity4 advert which has upset many today , i agree it is ill - judged ' @entity21 users roundly criticised the advert , describing it as ' disgusting ' and ' a publicity disaster waiting to happen ' - and @ @entity67 said on the website : ' " ill - judged " is a bit of an understatement '			1
' @entity4 usually get these things right , although on this occasion it is clear they have gone too far ' sir @entity2 , @entity4 founder people had earlier been campaigning for the company to take down the advert , with journalist @entity77 saying on @entity21 : ' is a rape " joke " really part of your @entity16 campaign ? ' charity project worker @entity83 added : ' using rape or domestic violence jokes to sell products ( is ) totally unacceptable '			1
chloroform is an obsolete anaesthetic , although it is still available and used as an industrial strength cleaner - and has been employed by criminals in the past to knock out victims			0
a 35 - year - old husband was jailed for eight years october 2011 after using chloroform to knock out his virgin wife - a @entity96 immigrant who was 21 at the time - and rape her in east @entity97 .			0
