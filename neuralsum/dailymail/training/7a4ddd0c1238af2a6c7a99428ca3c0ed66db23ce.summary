by @entity0 published : 22:50 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 03:36 est , 8 may 2013 children aged 12 run the highest risk of being killed or seriously injured as pedestrians , a major new report to transport secretary @entity5 reveals today			1
there is a sharp and alarming peak in casualty rates when youngsters reach this landmark birthday			0
and the absence from schools and tv of traditional road safety campaigns like the @entity16 of the 1960s and @entity18 man of the 1970s and ‘ 80s may be to blame , say experts			0
protective parents keeping their children close to home for longer and only letting them ‘ play out ’ when they reach secondary school may be another factor , they add			1
shocking : this graph shows a stark spike in road casualties for 12 - year - old children the report called ‘ @entity31 ’ also highlights a ‘ post-code lottery ’ of pedestrian child casualties with up to half of those killed or injured in the worst areas being children			1
but it also shows that in up to 60 per cent of cases , the pedestrians themselves are wholly or partially to blame by not paying proper attention to the road			1
the report was commissioned by the respected @entity44 ( @entity44 ) and written by experts at @entity47 - based @entity46			0
it has the approval of the @entity50 and the @entity51			0
the report and its supporters said the government must do more to tackle pedestrian deaths – particularly child deaths – after years of improvements had stalled			1
the report concludes bluntly : ‘ the age at which pedestrians are most at risk is 12 years old , with one in 651 children of that age reported as a pedestrian casualty			1
’ children are not prepared for the walk to school when they reach secondary school age , say road safety campaigners			1
file picture children are more likely to be injured in spring and summer , excluding august , compared to adults where the danger months are between october and january			0
the report is being presented to the @entity5 at a special @entity44 conference in @entity77 to mark the @entity79 ’s @entity78			1
it comes as 25 leading road safety and transport experts have signed a letter ( to @entity84 ) demanding the government do more to improve road safety and encourage walking			0
some 453 pedestrians were killed in @entity89 in 2011 , a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of all road deaths and a rise of 12 per cent on 2010			1
the letter says one in four @entity89 adults is ‘ obese ’ and this will double by 2050			0
yet only a quarter of @entity97 primary pupils are allowed to walk to school and back , compared with three - quarters in @entity99			1
@entity44 executive director @entity100 said that compared to a generation or so ago when @entity16 and the @entity18 were commonplace and repeated regularly on tv , road safety lessons in many schools were now ‘ patchy ’ and public funding for such campaigns is diminishing			0
the erosion of road safety campaigns like @entity111 the squirrel and the @entity108 may be behind the figures he said casualties were peaking at 12 because that was when pupils start secondary school and become more independent			1
he said : ' they may not have had any significant pedestrian or road safety training			2
' my impression is that pedestrian safety training used to be routine for years but is being squeezed out because of pressure from the national curriculum			2
’ report author @entity126 , a director of not - for - profit @entity46 and a father of two children – a son aged five and an eight - year - old daughter – said : ‘ i grew up in the 1970s and ‘ 80s and everyone knew the @entity18 from school and tv			2
that ’s not the case today			0
' he added that protective parents were keeping their children home during primary school years and only letting them out from secondary school age : ' it may be that what road safety lessons there are are aimed at seven , eight and nine - year - olds when maybe it is 11 , 12 and 13 year olds who need it today			1
it ’s only when they get to that age at secondary school that parents feel more confident of letting them out on their own			1
but though they are older , they do n’t have the road safety skills			0
’ warning : the report and its supporters said the government must do more to tackle pedestrian deaths - particularly child deaths			1
file picture the riskiest place for children is @entity163 , with @entity164 having the highest proportion ( 50 per cent higher risk of child pedestrian casualties than the national average ) , followed by @entity169 ( 49 per cent ) , @entity170 ( 48 per cent ) , @entity171 ( 48 per cent ) , @entity172 ( 46 per cent ) , @entity173 ( 46 per cent ) , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 ( all 45 per cent )			1
the lowest proportion of child pedestrian casualties are in @entity180 ( 11 per cent ) , @entity181 and @entity182 ( 12 per cent ) , and @entity183 in @entity77 ( 16 per cent ) , followed by @entity184 ( 16 per cent ) , @entity185 ( 17 per cent ) , @entity186 ( 18 per cent ) , @entity187 ( 18 per cent ) , @entity188 ( 18 per cent ) , @entity189 ( 19 per cent ) and @entity190 ( 19 per cent )			1
the ' @entity31 ' report was presented to transport secretary @entity5 for all pedestrians , @entity192 in @entity77 is the riskiest place with a risk level double that of the national average			1
it is followed by @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , and @entity163			0
lowest risk areas are @entity202 where the risk to pedestrians is 60 per cent lower than the national average			1
it is followed by @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity189 , the @entity210 and the @entity211			0
pedestrians ‘ failure to look properly ’ is the biggest contributory factor in accidents – representing nearly six out of ten cases - followed by pedestrians being ‘ careless , reckless or in a hurry ’ cited in about a quarter of cases			2
@entity220 comes ‘ driver failed to look properly ’ at about 1 in 5 ( 20 per cent )			0
pedestrians killed and seriously injured has fallen significantly in the last 30 years from 19,035 in 1980 to 5,605 in 2010			2
but the report stresses that pedestrian casualty reduction has slowed and actually increased in 2011			2
despite these falls , the percentage of all killed or seriously injured casualties who were pedestrians has remained remarkably stable ( 22.9 per cent in 2010 vs 22.4 per cent in 2010			1
road safety minister @entity228 said : ‘ as this report recognises , the @entity89 has some of the safest roads in the world for pedestrians , with the number killed or seriously injured falling significantly over the last 30 years			2
however we can not afford to be complacent			0
’ ‘ casualties for children under 15 have fallen considerably			2
however , we know that one death is one too many , which is why we are working directly with local authorities and other partners to ensure our road safety messages are reaching children and teenagers in schools			0
‘ we are also improving the resources provided to schools - both at primary and secondary level			2
’ tragic : @entity248 was killed by a hit - and - run driver in @entity250 last october the death of @entity248 at the age of 12 shows the dangers faced by children after they are first allowed to go out on the streets on their own			0
@entity248 was returning from a friend 's birthday party to his @entity250 home in october when he was hit by a car as he crossed the road in a scooter			0
he had used a pedestrian crossing to get to the other side of the main road , but driver @entity265 did not see him as he was travelling at well over the speed limit			2
@entity248 was thrown more than 50 metres in the collision , and later died of his injuries			0
after his death , the schoolboy 's family described him as ' one in a million ' , adding : ' for the rest of our lives we will have family occasions , gatherings and celebrations ruined because @entity248 is missing and there is an empty chair			0
' @entity265 , 21 , was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison after being found guilty of killing @entity248 , fleeing from the scene of the accident and subsequently lying to police .			0

*critics* say more *awareness* and education is needed
secondary school starters are not prepared thanks to protective parents
the lowest proportion of child pedestrian casualties are in @entity180
for all pedestrians , @entity192 in @entity77 is the riskiest place
