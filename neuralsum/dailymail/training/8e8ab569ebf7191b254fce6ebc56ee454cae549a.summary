by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:47 est , 14 february 2013 when this brazen fox snuck into @entity5 ’s home , his first thought was to ensure his grandchildren and wife were safe and out of its way			1
his second thought was to grab the camera			0
mr @entity5 who lives with his wife , @entity12 , in @entity13 , @entity14 , spotted this pesky fox race across his living room after it crept in through the back door - left open for just a few minutes			1
the fox entered @entity5 's house looking for a tasty snack the bold animal had run past the @entity22 ’s pet dog in the garden and even his pen of chickens – a more traditional snack for foxes - in pursuit of a more human treat			1
and it seems the fox would go to great lengths to find it			2
after coming to face - to - face with mr @entity5 in the lounge , undeterred , he ran over the top of the couch and headed for the kitchen			2
foxes have been spotted in broad daylight as they have become used to human contact he then leaped on to the work tops , scattering sharp cooking knives all over the floor , clambering over their @entity44 in a desperate hunt for food			2
it was only upon being shooed and kicked away that the fully - grown mammal gave up and left the house			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ amazingly , it then ran ten metres , stopped and looked back at me , before wandering off to the fields			1
‘ after telling my wife to close the door and stay in the living room , i was just thankful none of my grandchildren were at the house , as they often are			0
the grandfather of five said that both his lounge and kitchen are decorated in cream so his main concern became that ‘ it would defecate everywhere , ruining the furniture			0
my wife would n’t have been happy about that			0
' mr @entity5 , who runs a data installation company with his wife , added : the fox was not frightened of me at all , it must have been used to human contact			1
the smell of my dog must have been everywhere to			0

@entity5 made sure his family were safe before *snapping* the fox
the animal crept through a back door left open for a few minutes
it *bypassed* a chicken pen in *favour* of a more human treat
