deep in to added time , @entity0 was offered his @entity3 moment			1
one chance for salvation , @entity7 ’s right foot			1
if this was n’t quite an instant to match that of @entity15 ’s title winning moment against @entity17 of may 2012 , it was certainly one to stir the soul in similar fashion			1
in football – in sport – there is nothing quite like a contest that swings in the closing moments			0
as he moves forwards , though , @entity0 may realise that the similarities to @entity3 ’s day in the spring sunshine do not quite end with the score line and the name of the winning goal scorer			1
@entity0 shares a moment with counterpart @entity33 after being handed a lifeline @entity7 is mobbed by team - mates after firing @entity15 ahead in the dying seconds to complete a remarkable win @entity7 blasts @entity15 to their first @entity39 title against @entity17 two years ago for just as @entity3 failed to capitalise on that amazing day two - and - half years ago , so @entity0 must ensure that he does			1
this was magnificent , stomach - churning stuff			2
@entity45 teams in @entity46 needed it			0
it will , however , mean absolutely nothing if @entity0 and his hopelessly aimless team can not capitalise , if they can not use the adrenaline and the emotion of the experience to go on to better things			1
@entity3 ’s @entity15 team got worse after winning the league			1
@entity0 ’s side must get better quickly if this season is to amount to anything at all over the next six months			1
when is n’t he ? both of the opportunities he was afforded by calamitous @entity64 errors were perhaps 50 - 50 in terms of the probability of a goal			1
the first one was the most important – without the first there is no second – and that was the most difficult			0
@entity7 levels for @entity15 to give them a @entity73 lifeline ... and better was to come at the @entity74 @entity7 skips between @entity75 and @entity76 as the @entity78 striker put in a dazzling display the very best centre forwards , perhaps the top five per cent , have the ability almost to stop time when presented with opportunities that may frighten the life out of lesser sportsmen			1
like leading golfers standing over six - foot putts , the idea of missing is simply alien to then			2
here , on both occasions , there was a tangible calmness about the way that the @entity95 advanced towards goal and executed , two chances , two goals			2
only the very best can do that and @entity7 belongs in that category			1
that apart , though , there was very little to cheer here for @entity0 and @entity15			1
on the whole , this was another lamentable night for a team stuck in quick sand both domestically and in @entity46 at the moment			2
the result will have given everybody at this club and in this stadium a huge lift but only those who watched with their hands over their eyes will be able to ignore the issues that continue to blight this team			2
it is difficult to say that @entity15 played at all well at any stage of the game			0
they began poorly and were second best for a twenty minute period during which @entity64 may have scored twice			0
@entity123 blocked one effort and @entity125 the other			0
@entity127 was a claming presence in @entity15 's engine room as they bounced back to beat @entity64 @entity127 looks to the heavens after @entity131 pulls @entity64 level ... but the citizens would have the last laugh thanks to a super @entity127 pass , a rash challenge from @entity138 and a typically well - executed @entity7 penalty , @entity15 suddenly had the lead and a one - man advantage			1
on a night when only victory would do , this was their golden ticket			0
city , however , are so lame these days – so lacking in direction and belief – that even that was n’t enough to nudge them towards anything remotely approaching superiority			0
by half - time they were trailing and the most damning thing of all is that nobody here was the slightest bit surprised			1
over time , we expected @entity15 to impose themselves			0
surely @entity64 would tire and @entity15 would begin to stretch them and squeeze them at the same time			0
remarkably , it just did n’t happen			0
@entity64 coach @entity33 summed it up best afterwards when he said : ' we lost the game , we gave them the game			2
' look at the second half			0
we had ten but @entity164 [ @entity165 ] never had to make a save			0
' @entity7 controls the ball as @entity64 's @entity168 prepares to bring him down in the box @entity138 trudges off past @entity33 after the @entity170 received his marching orders @entity33 was not being deliberately provocative , merely presenting a pretty accurate story of what had happened			2
@entity64 – without a clutch of key players – had kept @entity15 at bay with some comfort since edging ahead			0
there was no cavalry charge from @entity15 , merely lots of aimless football , devoid of rhythm and crispness , that was ultimately rendered irrelevant by two stunning @entity64 errors that allowed @entity7 in twice in quick succession			1
quite simply , @entity15 must improve			0
one of their better players was @entity127			0
amid all the talk of extending his loan from @entity190 , it is pertinent to ask yourself this : why would he stay and play in a team that currently looks incapable of making a significant impression in the @entity39 or in @entity46 ? does all this sound a bit sour on a night of such drama ? perhaps but @entity15 and @entity0 should heed the warnings and of may 2012			1
as @entity3 found out to his cost , the gloss of these occasions will only last so long .			2

@entity7 gave @entity0 an *incredible* chance late on with his winning goal
the @entity78 striker gave previous *incumbent* @entity3 a similar shot at redemption against @entity17 in 2012
@entity3 failed to capitalise on that amazing day two - and - half years ago , so @entity0 must ensure that he does
it will , however , mean absolutely nothing if @entity0 and his hopelessly aimless team can not capitalise
