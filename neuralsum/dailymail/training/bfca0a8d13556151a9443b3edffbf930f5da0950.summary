for more than 700 years , @entity0 has hidden a secret buried in its foundations			2
a detailed underground plan of the 11th century medieval city has revealed a series of houses and a courtyard believed to be the remains of a royal palace			1
the map was created using geophysical ground - penetrating scanners on the site of the @entity14 fort near @entity15			1
the findings , which concentrated on the medieval period , revealed a series of large structures along the southern edge of the outer bailey defensive wall ( pictured )			1
the vast complex - thought to be a royal palace or defensive structures - measures 557ft ( 170 metre ) long and 213ft ( 65 metre ) wide the geophysical survey was carried out by archaeologists from the @entity27 using a range of state - of - the - art scanning techniques			1
they concentrated their survey around the inner and outer baileys of what was once a fortification , situated around two miles ( 3.2km ) from modern - day @entity15			1
@entity0 was an @entity14 fort established around 400 @entity37 and which measures 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) long and 1,180ft ( 360 metres ) wide			1
it was occupied by the @entity39 after the conquest of @entity41 in @entity42 when it was known as @entity0			2
a castle was built on the site after the @entity45 in 1066 , when @entity46 created a motte in the centre of the hillfort , adding an inner set of fortifications			0

the vast complex measures 557ft ( 170 metre ) long and 213ft ( 65 metre ) wide and is arranged around a large courtyard			1
experts believe the walls would have been up to 9ft ( 3 metres ) thick , and featured a 196ft ( 60 metre long ) hall			2
there is also evidence of towers and multi-storey buildings			0
the mapping additionally revealed an open area of ground behind these large structures , thought to have been used to deliver resources to their residents , or built as part of a circular route through the city			1
residential areas were found in the south east and south west quadrants of the outer bailey alongside the inner bailey ditch , alongside evidence of deposits indicating industrial features , such as kilns or furnaces as well as signs of quarrying after the 1300s			0

@entity0 is an @entity173 property			2
the team hopes to return to complete the survey of the inner and outer baileys and the settlement to the south of @entity0 in 2015			2

the inner castle and palace consisted of towers , halls and apartments , while a cathedral was built on the north - western section in 1092 @entity196 , director of archaeological prospection services at the @entity27 , said : ' archaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at @entity0 , but until now there has been no proper plan of the site			1
' our survey shows where individual buildings are located and from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan within the city walls			2

the inner castle and royal palace consisted of towers , halls and apartments , while the north - western section of the bailey was chosen as the site for a new cathedral , built in 1092			0
all early buildings in the castle would have been made of timber , and the oldest surviving stone structure , the keep , is said to have been built early in the reign of @entity250 in the 12th century			0
the royal palace within the castle was subsequently used by @entity254 monarchs			0
eventually , a new cathedral was established during the 1220s in what is now modern - day @entity15			1
this caused the clergy to abandon @entity0 and marked the start of a gradual decline of the region in favour of @entity15 , now known as modern - day @entity15			1
the castle continued in use , and money was spent on its repair and maintenance during the reign of @entity271 in the 14th century			0
by the 19th century , the settlement was officially uninhabited but still had formal parliamentary representation			0
@entity0 is currently an @entity173 property and is open to the public			0
source : @entity173 the research was conducted as part of the @entity0 and @entity279 , directed by @entity196 and fellow @entity280 archaeologists @entity281 and @entity283			0
@entity0 is currently an @entity173 property and is open to the public			0
@entity286 , property curator at @entity173 , said : ' having the team of archaeologists on site over the summer gave our visitors a chance to find out more about how important historic landscapes are surveyed			0
' the use of modern , non-invasive surveying is a great start to further research at @entity0			0
' from this work we can surmise much about the site 's past and , whilst we ca n't conclusively date the findings , it adds a new layer to @entity0 's story			0
we welcome the chance to find out more about our sites , and look forward to exploring ideas for further research in the future			0
' mr @entity196 added : ' our research so far has shown how the entire outer bailey of the monument was heavily built up in the @entity311 , representing a substantial urban centre			0
' results have given us compelling evidence as to the nature of some of the structures			0
it is clear , however , that there is more non-intrusive work that could be carried out to further expand our understanding of the site			0
' the team hopes to return to complete the survey of the inner and outer baileys and survey the @entity328 - @entity41 settlement to the south of @entity0 in @entity330 .			1

@entity0 was an @entity14 fort near @entity15 established around 400 @entity37
it measures 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) long and 1,180ft ( 360 metres ) wide
@entity334 was gradually abandoned in favour of @entity15 in the 13th century
the survey is being carried out by the @entity27
they used ground - penetrating scanners to map underground medieval city
mapping has revealed a series of houses , industrial buildings and courtyard within what is thought to be a vast palace or defensive structures
