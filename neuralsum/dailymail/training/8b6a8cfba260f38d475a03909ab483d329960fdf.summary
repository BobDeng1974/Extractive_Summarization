by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 17 november 2013 @entity2 : 10:56 est , 17 november 2013 you 're likely to be rated as more attractive when pictured in a group than when alone , according to new research			2
being pictured with friends could boost your perceived attractiveness as people tend to ' average out ' everyone 's facial features when looking at group photos			1
observers perceive each individual 's face as more average than they would otherwise - and average faces are deemed more attractive			0
the phenomenon is dubbed the ' cheerleader effect '			0
@entity19 shows her support to @entity21 by attending their gig at @entity24 earlier this month research suggests those who are thought to look most average and most attractive , due to lack of oddities			0
' average faces are more attractive , likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies , ' says @entity29 , a psychological scientist			1
he carried out the study alongside @entity31 of the @entity32			1
their findings were published in @entity35 , a journal of the @entity37 , reported @entity38			0
' perhaps it 's like @entity41 's families : beautiful people are all alike , but every unattractive person is unattractive in their own way , ' says @entity29			2
@entity19 pictured alone at @entity45 ( left ) and with @entity46 and @entity47 ( right )			0
research suggests the ' averaging out ' of looks in group photos makes everyone look more attractive the character @entity52 from @entity53 first coined the term in an episode of the popular tv show			1
he said the @entity58 ( @entity59 , @entity60 , and , for a brief window in the mid- 90s , the @entity57 ) is when women appear ' hot ' - but only as a group , not individually			1
if you take each member of that group individually they are in fact , on the contrary , unattractive , as flaws become more obvious			2
@entity29 and @entity31 set out to find out wheher the attractiveness of average faces , coupled with the tendency to encode groups of objects as an ' ensemble ' , might support @entity52 's theory			1
to test this , researchers performed five experiments with over 130 undergraduate students who were shown pictures of 100 people , and asked to rate their attractiveness			2
sometimes the person being rated was in a group portrait with two other people , and other times the pictures were cropped to show the person alone			0
overall , participants rated both female and male subjects as more attractive in the group shot than when pictured alone			0
being seen in a group offers an attractiveness benefit roughly enough to bump someone up two per cent			2
the phenomenon was first dubbed the ' cheerleader effect ' by @entity52 on @entity53 ' the effect is definitely small , but some of us need all the help we can get , ' said @entity31			1
in several other experiments , @entity29 and @entity31 discovered that the pictures do n't need to be from an organic group portrait to obtain this effect			1
participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of one person out of a collage of 4 , 9 , and 16 pictures			0
the ' group ' picture was still rated more highly than when that individual 's picture was presented alone			0
' if the average is more attractive because unattractive idiosyncrasies tend to be averaged out , then individuals with complementary facial features - one person with narrow eyes and one person with wide eyes , for example - would enjoy a greater boost in perceived attractiveness when seen together , as compared to groups composed of individuals who have more similar features , ' says @entity31			1
in the study , ' group ' pictures were rated more highly than pictures of individuals presented alone			0

@entity58 says group photos boost perceived attractiveness
@entity29 and @entity31 of the @entity32 confirm this
