by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			1
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
this week , @entity10 is given both barrels , why @entity12 may not want to complain about @entity13 and which teams @entity0 's tipping for the drop			1
@entity10 , @entity10 , @entity10			1
cheeky , cheating , @entity10			1
@entity17 did n’t catch you in the face			1
but you squealed like a tasered pig , then rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled			2
straight over : @entity17 saw red for this aerial ' challenge ' on @entity23 defender @entity10 ca n't believe it : @entity25 man @entity17 was dismissed by @entity26 , putting the @entity13 down to ten agony ? @entity10 's rolling around and clutching his face may have contributed to @entity26 's decision one minute you ’re threatening your own team - mate with a brick and the next you ’ve been shot by a sniper			1
you should be ashamed of yourself			2
@entity10 ’s reaction to @entity17 ’s arm going across the side of his head was pure theatre			1
he should have been booked and i would hope his manager @entity41 and team - mates will have words with him			2
that is not what football is about			2
@entity12 ’s outrageous rant about @entity13 playing 19th century football in their goalless draw against @entity49 was used to deflect from his own team ’s inability to break down @entity13 ’s resolute , determined and dogged defending			1
@entity13 doubled up in all areas and sat deep , not allowing any space behind their back four			2
it meant the intricate play of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 was ineffective			2
complaining : @entity12 deflected attention away from his own team 's failings to break @entity13 down @entity64 : @entity49 stars like @entity60 could n't find a way past @entity13 stars like @entity68 ( left ) @entity12 ’s very clever , with a big smile on his face , at shifting all the blame on to @entity72			1
but underneath i think he was probably raging , knowing that without a top quality centre - forward they will not be able to win the @entity76			2
and also that @entity79 , with his superior passing ability in the final third , would no doubt have been more than useful on the night			2
the @entity80 ? former @entity49 star @entity79 may have made a difference in the final third his ability to slip a pass through the eye of a needle in the @entity13 game would have been perfect for such deep defending			2
i ’m looking forward to monday night when @entity12 takes his @entity49 team to @entity88 and we ’ll see if they will play an open attacking , expansive game to take on mr @entity93 ’s side			1
it ’s more likely @entity12 will be parking the super-yacht , as it is in @entity49 ’s case , to keep out @entity98 ’s relentless attack			1
not even the farcical situation at @entity100 where my old chauffer @entity101 got sacked one minute then reinstated the next			1
earlier in the week he was told that @entity104 was coming in and wanted to sit on the bench for the game against @entity107			2
in the face of chaos : @entity101 was sacked one minute and reinstated the next at @entity100 obviously @entity101 said no. everyone knew what was happening and the prospective owner , @entity113 , was quite obviously trying to force him out			1
i know @entity101 very well and you could n’t meet a nicer , humbler , more down - to - earth man if you tried			1
while he was chief scout at @entity117 he kindly offered to be my chauffer for three months when i broke my leg playing in the @entity121 final on a sunday afternoon			2
i was assistant manager to @entity122 at the club then			0
@entity101 picked me up every day and dropped me off after work and we had some great laughs			1
@entity127 : @entity100 fans showed their support for @entity101 against @entity130 he used to have to help me with my crutches getting in and out of the car			1
some of the highlights included late night journeys home after scouting and watching other teams play			0
we would sit and listen to the late night peoples ’ problems programme on the radio , about all sorts of tricky challenges we face in our lives			0
when they sacked @entity101 on friday , i wonder if he made one of those phone calls to his local radio station to ask for advice and guidance , as the inside of his head must ’ve been all over the place			1
with 14 games to go it is still possible for teams to put a run together to get out of relegation trouble			0
it was obvious that @entity158 would improve the spirit of the playing staff at @entity161 after taking over from @entity162			0
now bad boy @entity163 and the magician on the wing @entity166 look like rejuvenated , regenerated and quality @entity76 players			0
@entity158 has also recruited well and he has proven what can be done			0
@entity170 have also got momentum and now @entity13 ’s players have returned to fitness they will go from strength to strength			0
dead man walking ? @entity178 manager @entity177 trudges off the pitch after losing 3 - 0 to @entity180 @entity181 lack a goal - scorer and with the players they ’ve got i think they ’ve done particularly well			1
but it ’s going to be tough for @entity178 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
strikers are the key in a relegation scrap			0
it ’s no surprise @entity194 got rid of @entity195 and @entity196 as their team ethic and willingness to do a shift are not the right ingredients for a recipe to avoid relegation			0
hush now : @entity188 will find it hard despite @entity206 's winner against @entity181 whether new record signing @entity207 can score the goals to keep them up remains to be seen and the same applies to @entity210 at @entity188			1
for me , relegation will go down to the last day and right to the wire , but it ’s @entity178 , @entity187 and @entity188 to go			1
i ’m out and about now watching loads of games and i empathise with the wicked , at times cruel , life of the professional football manager			0
the frustration of the ball hitting the post and rolling along the line back into the goalkeeper ’s arm ; the blatant penalty decision not given ; a simple pass to slot your centre forward in for a last - minute equaliser just over hit			0
a supporter sat five yards from me at a game i went to last week was shouting his mouth off ; i ’m not sure if he was doing an impression of sir @entity236 , sir @entity237 or sir @entity238 telling the manager exactly what he should be doing			0
as the minutes ticked by on that luminous orange clock you know as a manager it is a ticking time bomb and brings you closer to the guillotine with every second that flashes by			0
it ’s draining , exhausting and you know there ’s not a lot you can do			0
it ’s a horrible feeling and i ’ve been there many , many times			0
but the desire to get back in and win another championship fuels the blood that flows through my veins			0
as i wrote this column i was on my way to the @entity260 in @entity117 for a two - hour one - to - one tutorial to help improve my @entity264 @entity263 skills			0
on the way i sat in the car park looking over the pitch where i played my first game of football for @entity270 , when i was aged seven , in an under 11 game			0
i can remember it like it was yesterday			0
to think that skinny , nice , quiet , young boy – with ambitions and dreams – could step from where i was standing to play at @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 , is quite surreal			0
oh my @entity282 , to think that was 41 years ago is quite scary .			0

@entity10 's reaction to @entity17 's challenge was pure theatre
@entity12 will shut up shop against @entity88
nothing surprises me after @entity101 's weekend
i *'m* backing @entity187 , @entity178 and @entity188 for the drop
