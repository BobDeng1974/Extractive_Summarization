by @entity0 the quino checkerspot , found in @entity3 and @entity4 , has moved to higher altitudes to avoid extinction , scientists claim as the planet warms , animals and plants are learning to adapt to their new environment by either migrating or evolving , new research has revealed			1
many scientists believe the rate of climate change is too rapid for various species to keep up			2
but two new studies have offered some hope that experts may have underestimated their abilities			0
the first study reveals how a species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet			1
the quino checkerspot , found in @entity3 and @entity4 , moved to higher altitudes to avoid extinction , according to research presented at the @entity31 's symposium in @entity32			1
its rapid adaption offers some hope to scientists that other insects could be able to change their environment and survive a warmer climate			1
separate research led by @entity42 scientist @entity41 found how some corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer - than - average tidal waters			1
the research team discovered corals can adjust their internal functions to tolerate hot water 50 times faster than they would adapt through evolutionary change alone			1
research led by @entity42 found thatsome corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer - than - average tidal waters			1
pictured is @entity42 graduate student @entity56 taking samples from an @entity59 hyacinthus colony at the @entity60 of @entity61 they were once believed to be impervious to fire , but it appears that increasing temperatures are having a shrinking effect on salamanders			0
wild salamanders in @entity69 are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier , forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate			1
researchers from the @entity75 found that salamanders in the @entity77 today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the @entity79			0
the changes were most marked in the @entity77 and at low elevations – settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most			0
scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and , the researchers sasy , this is strong confirmation of that prediction			0
‘ the temperature of coral reefs is variable , so it stands to reason that corals should have some capacity to respond to different heat levels , ’ professor @entity41 said			1
‘ these results tell us that both nature and nurture play a role in deciding how heat - tolerant a coral colony is			2
‘ @entity104 , the effect of environment , can change heat tolerance much more quickly - within the lifetime of one coral rather than over many generations			1
’ it ’s not just butterflies and corals that are adapting			2
from chipmunks to @entity117 spiders , scientists are increasingly tracking how animals are evolving to cope with the effects of hotter temperatures			1
‘ most of the models that ecologists are putting out are assuming that there 's no adaptive capacity			0
and that 's silly , ’ @entity121 , a geneticist at the @entity122 told @entity123			0
‘ organisms are not static			0
’ writing for @entity132 , systems biologist @entity131 said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures			0
dr @entity131 cited the work of a team of scientists at the @entity145 as an example of how creatures are adapting to warmer temperatures			2
the scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in @entity151 and found that over 100 years the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by 3 ° c. scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in @entity151 and found that over 100 years , the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by three degrees @entity157 dna evidence suggests the @entity160 wasp spider ( pictured ) is evolving and has colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates			1
the spiders primarily lived in @entity117 regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity168 region dna evidence also suggests the @entity160 wasp spider is evolving and have colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates			1
the spiders primarily lived in @entity117 regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity168 region			0
interestingly while scientists thought they were trying to find new places to live that were the same temperature as the @entity117 before temperatures have risen , the spiders have actually moved into regions that are cooler than their original homes			1
the reason for their behaviour is they have been mating with spiders that like the cold , to create an invading species that can survive freezing temperatures that would kill its @entity117 relatives , researchers from @entity178 's @entity177 told dr @entity131			2
a 2011 review of data on hundreds of moving species found a average shift to higher altitudes of 36 feet ( 11 metres ) per decade and a average shift to higher latitudes of about 10.5 miles ( 17 km ) per decade			1
‘ i think we should feel impressed by the impact that we have , that we can change the course of evolution around us by the way we change the environment , ’ @entity193 , from @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity192 told @entity123			0
‘ our impact is much further and deeper than we tend to think			0
’ for the first time in millennia , the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million ( ppm ) for an entire month			2
april ’s carbon dioxide readings come less than a year after scientists warned that the amount of the gas in the @entity213 ’s atmosphere could surpass the 400ppm marker and stay there			0
the gas is considered by many scientists to be responsible for global warming and has consistently breached the mark for a month – likely for the first time in 800,000 years			0
april ’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm , according to scientists at the @entity223 in @entity224			2
the institution is the custodian of the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements , which were started in the 1950s by @entity230 on the @entity231 in @entity232 , @entity225 reported			0
based on ice core samples from the @entity236 ice sheet that preserve samples of old air , experts from @entity223 said that carbon dioxide levels did not breach 300ppm prior to the industrial revolution for the past 800,000 years .			0
