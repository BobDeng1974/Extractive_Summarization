photography enthusiast @entity0 was pleased to find some rolls of old film among the usual collection of discarded @entity5 lining the shelves of a backstreet thrift shore in @entity8			1
but what mr @entity0 did n't realise was that he 'd accidentally stumbled upon a piece of @entity12 's wartime history - as captured by a young @entity14 couple who appeared to be on their honeymoon in @entity17			1
for among the 400 or so negatives on the 35mm nitrate films , he was shocked to uncover previously unseen photos of @entity21 touring @entity17 at the height of his powers			0
the pictures were taken by a mystery photographer , who mr @entity0 believes may either have ended up living in the city of @entity27 , where the films were purchased , or @entity29 , which is featured in many of the photos			1
among the scores of holiday snaps and family photos , the pictures - taken in the years before the @entity36 - reveal the unknown photographer 's brush with the 20th century 's most infamous leaders			1
in one of the forgotten photos , @entity21 is pictured sitting next to @entity42 of @entity17 during a parade in @entity44 in 1938 after the @entity45 had viewed fellow fascist leader @entity47 's naval fleet in the @entity48			2
mr @entity0 , who has held an exhibition of the photos in @entity51 , @entity8 , said : ' in 2013 i found several rolls of negatives in a thrift store in @entity27 , @entity8			1
they were standard 35mm , black and white and some of the rolls were clearly nitrate film			2
' much to my surprise the film included photographs of @entity21 and @entity42 on parade , other @entity65 images from @entity44 , @entity17 in the @entity66 , numerous photos of @entity44 city life , @entity69 and photos of @entity71			2
' pictures of @entity21 - sitting on the left beside @entity73 of @entity17 - were uncovered on films found in a thrift store in @entity27 , @entity8 by photography enthusiast @entity0 mystery couple : the roll of vacatation snaps also includes a picture of the photographer and a woman thought to be his wife			1
the man is thought to have worked for @entity85 @entity21 visited @entity17 in 1938 to meet with fellow @entity86 leader @entity47			0
the photos uncovered in @entity8 are believed to show him after he viewed @entity17 's naval fleet @entity21 ( circled ) is pictured receiving fascist salutes from @entity91 troops , who lined the seafront road in @entity44 for his visit the images show @entity21 's cavalcade surrounded by motorcycle outriders as he is paraded along the streets of the southern @entity91 city the pictures also appear to show young members of @entity47 's @entity102 or @entity104 youth movement , which was similar to the @entity105 in @entity106 @entity21 took a tour of @entity17 in 1938 , and joined @entity47 and the king on board the battleship @entity111 in @entity44 to watch military exercises the photographer managed to capture a picture of the @entity91 fleet , which was amassed of the coast for the @entity45 's visit the pictures also offer an insight into the fascist architecture being built in @entity17 at the time , with swastikas adorning a number of public monuments ( above and below ) @entity21 's visit to @entity44 was one of many meetings between the two leaders , pictured here ahead of the 1938 @entity130 conference			2
file photo the rolls of film were later bought by @entity0 ( pictured left with the films ) , who used newspaper cuttings to work out when they were taken @entity47 's fascist regime , which took control of @entity17 in 1925 , was in many ways seen as a forerunner to @entity21 's own @entity65 party			1
@entity21 is known to have admired the way @entity47 swept to power and wrote to him in 1923 , the year after the @entity91 's famous ' march on @entity142 ' protests			0
after @entity47 took control of @entity17 , he provided financial assistance to @entity21 's @entity146 and allowed the @entity147 to train with his ' @entity149 ' brigades			0
after taking power in @entity106 , @entity21 backed @entity47 's invasion of @entity152 ( now @entity153 ) in 1935 and the two countries ' forces lined up together with the @entity156 in the @entity157			0
but despite the diplomatic consensus , the pair 's first meeting in 1934 ( pictured right ) went badly , with @entity47 struggling to understand @entity21 's @entity162 accent			0
@entity21 is believed to have felt upstaged by @entity47 's elaborate uniform and the @entity91 is said to have found @entity21 boring and described him as ' a mad little clown '			2
despite the personal differences , the two leaders signed the so - called ' @entity167 ' in 1939 , agreeing military and economic cooperation			0
@entity17 did n't officially enter the @entity36 until 1940 and after a disasterous campaign in @entity171 , the @entity169 invaded @entity172 in 1943 , with @entity47 later expelled from power and executed			0
@entity174 fell in 1945 , with @entity21 committing suicide in his military bunker			0
the pictures also include some street scenes of 1930s @entity44 , including this one , showing a children 's goat - drawn cart in a city square the snaps show the photographers ' interest in @entity17 's famous sportcars , including a photo of this vehicle , pictured on a seaside promenade the rolls of film also contain more usual holiday snaps from the photographer 's visit , including shots of the @entity44 skyline at the time mr @entity0 also found a series a photos of @entity29 on the films , apparently taken from a boat rolling into the city 's famous harbour the pictures , which show a crowded boat about the dock in the @entity14 , suggest the man either visited @entity17 on a trip or moved to @entity14 from @entity12 ahead of the @entity36 the photos , along with tales from mr @entity0 ' attempts to work out their origins , were made the subject of a recent exhibition at @entity213 in @entity51 , @entity8 mr @entity0 traced the location of the pictures by comparing this shot of @entity44 waterfront with modern - day pictures of the same location the photographer , seemingly a car enthusiast , also took photos of this @entity224 garage and motorists filling their vehicles outside			1
