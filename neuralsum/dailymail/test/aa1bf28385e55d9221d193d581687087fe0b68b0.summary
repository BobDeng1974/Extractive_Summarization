the common ancestor of humans may have had tentacles , a scientist has claimed			1
organisms that lived in the sea 635 to 541 million years ago , from which humans and other animals evolved , likely had flexible appendages and a complex nervous system			1
it seemingly puts to bed another theory that suggests our ancestors were much more simple , worm - like creatures			2
a @entity17 scientist says the distant ancestor of humans had tentacles			1
one such creature can be seen at the centre of this illustration			0
they lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food			1
it 's likely they also had a complex nervous system like we do today the latest research was conducted by dr @entity32 from the @entity33 at the @entity34 of the @entity35			1
today , humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric - we have a clearly discernible top and bottom , and a left and a right			2
however , our distant ancestors hundreds of millions ago were not , with many of them thought to be worm - like creatures that swam in the seas or walked on the seafloor			1
a warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into @entity50 1.4 million years ago , a new study suggests			1
researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors , the hominins , had been halted by colder and drier temperatures			2
but as conditions warmed , they were able to branch out from @entity57 into @entity58 , and ultimately spread across @entity50			0
the research was led by dr @entity60 from the @entity61 ( @entity61 )			0
how we evolved into bilateral creatures , and what we evolved from , has been a cause of some debate			0
one theory suggests that our common bilaterian ancestor was a worm without appendages and just a simple nervous system			1
dr @entity73 ’s research , though , favours a different theory			0
she says that our ancestors had appendages - or tentacles - that were used for movement and food collection			2
and , she says , they also had a complex nervous system			1
to come to her conclusion she studied @entity84 , an ancient brachiopod found all over the world			0
@entity84 is one of the oldest brachiopods having survived to the present day , originating in the @entity89 era 500 million years ago			1
for that reason , and as it has hardly changed over geological time , it is often referred to as a ‘ living fossil ’ of organisms in the distant past			0
today , humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric ; we have a clearly discernible top and bottom , and a left and a right - such as depicted in @entity102 's @entity101 , shown left			2
dr @entity32 came to her conclusion by studying the ' living fossil ' @entity84 , shown right ‘ by virtue of the fact that there are tentacles among the two main taxons of bilaterally symmetrical animals , it is logical to assume that the common ancestor also had them , ’ said dr @entity32			2
‘ it means that the common ancestor of chordate animals [ such as mammals , fish and birds ] including people also had tentacles			0
’ she said that , therefore , it could be assumed that our ancestors had tentacular appendages			0
it is hoped that this research will help to more accurately classify various species			0

@entity17 scientist says distant ancestor of humans had tentacles
they lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food
it 's likely they also had a complex nervous system like we do today
*challenges* another theory that says our ancestors were more worm - like
