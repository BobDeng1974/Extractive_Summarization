by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 will launch a bizarre campaign today to make @entity4 issue a formal public apology for @entity7 ’s handling of the miners ’ strike in the 1980s			1
the opposition will insist that the government should say sorry for the actions of the late prime minister ’s administration , claiming it deliberately sought to escalate the dispute			2
shadow cabinet office minister , @entity17 will raise the issue in the @entity19 , challenging ministers to set out ‘ all details of the interactions between the government and the police at the time ’			1
campaign : @entity2 want to make @entity4 issue a formal public apology for @entity7 's handling of the miners ' strike in the 1980s he will also suggest that there should be a ‘ proper investigation ’ into the ugliest confrontation of the strike in 1984 , when 10,000 striking miners clashed with 5,000 police officers in what became known as the @entity36			1
@entity37 , who was @entity7 ’s trade and industry secretary during the strike , dismissed @entity2 ’s ‘ justice for the coalfields ’ campaign as absurd			1
‘ next they ’ll want an apology for freeing the @entity47 , ’ the @entity44 peer said			0
‘ i presume @entity49 is doing this in order to get some more money from @entity53 [ the union ]			0
‘ my recollection is that the police were principally used to protect miners who wanted to go to work and who had not been granted a ballot , but were being prevented from doing so by [ @entity61 leader ] @entity63 ’s hate mob			1
confrontation : police grapple with those on the picket line at @entity67 ‘ neither @entity2 nor @entity63 has ever apologised for that			2
’ @entity37 added : ‘ i trust the government will merely laugh at this ridiculous campaign			2
’ it is likely to cause unease among the dwindling band of @entity74 , who will fear that the party risks alienating @entity76 by appearing to back mr @entity63 in a 30 - year - old argument			0
the move comes after the release of @entity81 papers earlier this month showing that @entity7 came within days of declaring a state of emergency and calling out the military four months into the miners ’ strike			1
scathing : @entity37 , who was @entity7 ¿ s trade and industry secretary during the strike , dismissed @entity2 's ' justice for the coalfields ' campaign as absurd dismissal : @entity37 , pictured with @entity7 in 1985 , said he presumed @entity2 was campaigning for an apology to get money from union unite ministers secretly discussed recalling @entity95 in the summer of 1984 to pass emergency legislation , according to documents released to the @entity98			1
the files show that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal , but the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic			0
@entity2 says the papers also suggest that the @entity7 government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs and that it sought to influence police tactics to escalate the dispute			1
industrial action was triggered in march 1984 by plans to close 20 loss - making pits			0
mr @entity63 went into battle with the @entity119 and a year - long war of attrition ensued			0
dispute : @entity2 says the papers also suggest that the @entity7 government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs strikes : industrial action was triggered in march 1984 by plans to close 20 loss - making pits			2
@entity61 leader @entity63 went into battle with the @entity119 and a year - long war of attrition ensued mr @entity17 , mp for the former pit town of @entity129 , where mr @entity63 was born , said : ‘ for those of us who lived through the strike and who saw the events and impact they had first hand , what was revealed in the @entity81 papers may not come as a surprise			1
‘ but it is no less shocking to consider that , far from being neutral , as was claimed at the time , it is clear that the government took a deliberately calculated political approach guided by a complete hostility to the coalfield communities			0
‘ that is why i am calling for justice for the coalfields			0
’ he added : ‘ ministers may want to sweep these events under the carpet , but the scars of the dispute and the subsequent closure programme remain on the memories , communities and landscapes of all coalfield communities			0
‘ they must now apologise and deliver transparency to begin to foster reconciliation with the coalfield communities			0
