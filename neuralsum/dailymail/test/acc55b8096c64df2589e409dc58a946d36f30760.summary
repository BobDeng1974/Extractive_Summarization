@entity0 and @entity1 appear set to contest the @entity3 award after the six - man shortlist was unveiled			1
hazard is hot favourite thanks to his consistently brilliant form for @entity8 , runaway leaders at the top of the @entity11 , but @entity1 is the homespun hero after a fabulous breakthrough season at @entity13			1
the 21 - year - old @entity13 striker has 29 goals in all competitions to date and forced his way into @entity19 ’s squad , scoring within 79 seconds of his @entity21 debut against @entity22 last month			0
@entity1 's prolific form for @entity13 has seen him nominated for @entity3 @entity0 ( left ) has propelled @entity8 to the top of the @entity11 with his brilliant displays @entity27 ( right ) scores for @entity8 in the @entity29 final victory over @entity13 at @entity30 @entity31 has had no trouble adapting to the @entity11 , scoring 20 times for @entity34 so far @entity0 - @entity8 @entity27 - @entity8 @entity1 - @entity13 @entity31 - @entity34 @entity36 - @entity35 @entity38 - @entity37 @entity1 , the only @entity21 player up for the main award , has scored 19 in the @entity11 , the same number as @entity27 , who is also on the shortlist , along with @entity31 , @entity38 and @entity36			1
@entity43 ’s miserable demise is perhaps summed up by the fact none of their players made the cut , including @entity47 who also has 19 @entity11 goals and is locked together with @entity1 and @entity27 in the race for the @entity50			1
@entity0 , 24 , is heavily odds - on with the bookmakers after leading @entity8 ’s charge for a first title in five years and 17 goals in all competitions			2
goalkeeper @entity36 ( left ) has been @entity35 's most impressive player of the season @entity38 ( left ) has enjoyed his best season yet for @entity37 and is also up for @entity3 the @entity60 nominations are : @entity0 - @entity8 @entity1 - @entity13 @entity38 - @entity37 @entity61 - @entity37 @entity36 - @entity35 @entity62 - @entity8 @entity63 plumped for hazard when asked to name his winner , without voting for anyone from his @entity34 squad			1
@entity31 made an explosive start to the campaign but his form has faded during the spring , when the votes are cast			0
the same could be said for @entity27 , who scored 13 of his 19 @entity8 goals before the turn of the year			2
@entity75 ’s early - season form was strong , too , keeping @entity35 in contention for the top four as @entity77 struggled to find the right formula			0
hazard ( left ) poses with former @entity37 striker @entity80 ( right ) after last year 's award ceremony @entity82 voted for @entity38 but the @entity83 is an outsider because @entity37 have been unable to match last season ’s success			0
four of the six - all but @entity27 and @entity31 - are also on the shortlist for the @entity88 with @entity62 and @entity61 making up the numbers			0
@entity1 is the favourite to win the @entity88 award .			0
