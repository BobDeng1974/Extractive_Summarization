well , they did it again			0
it ’s four on the trot now – a record			0
@entity8 have not missed a @entity14 semi-final date this century : 2002 , 2006 , 2010 , now 2014			1
it was 1998 , in @entity16 , when they last failed to be in the competition in the final week , and they will be there again , in @entity20 on tuesday			1
and back here , in the @entity21 , one last time a week on sunday ? there is no reason why not			0
@entity8 did not have the best chances , or necessarily play the best football , but they were excellent in possession , decisive and sharp at key defensive moments and found a way to win , as the best teams do			1
as @entity8 do , so often , in fact			1
that the goal came from @entity7 , a bold selection by coach @entity33 who also abandoned his false nine system and restored @entity36 to full - back , merely adds to the evidence that @entity8 are @entity14 naturals in a way other countries – you know who – are not			1

manager : low 8 booked : @entity97 , @entity96 goals : @entity52 referee : @entity114 7 ( @entity115 ) * @entity3 ratings by @entity117 at the @entity21 @entity16 have a good record of going deep into the competition once beyond the first round , too			1
but they met their match here			0
@entity8 ’s defensive shield was set up too efficiently to let them pass , despite the best efforts of @entity70 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
goalkeeper @entity90 was exceptional , again , on what was his 50th international appearance			1
there was a lot of @entity131 pressure in the second - half , but the best chance still fell to @entity8			1
when @entity92 broke down the left flank , his cross sat perfectly for @entity98 , who should have claimed @entity8 ’s second and took the last remaining tension from the game			1
instead , he missed his kick and the ball fell to substitute @entity100 who could not continue his run of five goals in consecutive internationals			2
@entity54 saved with his feet			2
this was far from the most impressive @entity146 performance of this @entity14			1
yet that , in its way , makes it all the more impressive			0
this is a team that cuts a path through , even in adversity ; that came to @entity55 with seven players suffering a viral illness , yet did n’t even pack its big suitcases for the journey home , because it had no intention of departing early			0
confident ? arrogant ? check the record			0
they have every reason to be both			0
there have been 13 @entity166 since 1966 and @entity8 have made the last four in ten of them			2
@entity168 , the other finalists that year : one			0
it was an outcome that vindicated @entity33 in so many ways			2
his changes worked , most particularly the reintroduction of @entity7 for @entity109			0
@entity33 worked out that @entity16 ’s greatest threat came with pace and the ball over the top and that @entity109 would be ill - equipped to deal with this			2
in addition , @entity7 scored the only goal of the game and made a vital block			0
tactically , it was a full house			0
my ball : @entity16 midfielder @entity73 ( right ) stretches to challenge @entity187 ( left ) going down : @entity8 forward @entity98 falls theatrically inside the famous @entity21 stadium safe hands : @entity54 ( left ) clutches the ball after diving bravely at the feet of @entity98 ( centre ) in control : @entity8 striker @entity99 ( right ) takes a touch under pressure from @entity66 ( left ) no way through : @entity8 keeper @entity90 ( right ) pulls off an acrobatic save to keep out an effort from @entity70 @entity8 's @entity96 got on the ball throughout midfield , as his heat map below shows - click here for more in our @entity3 @entity16 had the best chances of the first - half , but @entity8 secured the all - important goal			1
that it came from a header and a set - piece is rather fitting			0
this was the most ordinary game of the knock - out rounds so far and , after the fireworks of the last 16 , probably felt something of an anti-climax			0
yet that is to deny @entity8 ’s mastery of tournament football , of game management , of getting a nose in front and staying there			2
@entity16 have been lively in @entity222 and even @entity146 hero @entity223 feared the worst			2
he said if his countrymen were not at their best would go out			0
@entity8 were n’t great , but it is @entity16 who are going home			2
yes , it would be nice if every match could go off like a 4th of july parade – but there is enormous merit in what @entity8 did here , too			2
@entity236 ’s goal came in the 12th minute , from a straightforward free - kick that found @entity16 ’s defence wanting			0
@entity94 whipped the ball in and @entity7 got the better of @entity48 – so impressive until now – to head past the helpless @entity54			0
a reasonable penalty shout in the 25th minute aside – @entity66 certainly appeared to pull @entity99 ’s shirt , but the fall was needlessly theatrical and did the case for the prosecution few favours – the best of the game belonged to @entity16			0
yet @entity8 ’s ease in possession was to be admired , as was their measured game - plan and , once again , the performance of @entity90			1
he was talked of as @entity8 ’s new sweeper after the match with @entity255 , when he appeared to spend much of his time patrolling the outfield area behind the defensive high line , and that seems to be more deliberate ploy than happy accident			2
battle : midfielders @entity94 ( right ) and @entity72 ( left ) tussle for the ball during the first period @entity267 : @entity268 defender @entity48 leaps into the air to bring the ball down with ease big opportunity : @entity16 striker @entity77 ( right ) has an effort at goal but ca n't beat @entity7 and @entity90 driving force : @entity75 ( centre ) attempts to burst between @entity96 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) high foot ? the right boot of @entity187 ( right ) almost catches diminutive midfielder @entity70 in the face low deserves credit for recognising that @entity90 is as much footballer as goaltender and can allow @entity8 to play in a different way			1
many years ago , @entity283 said that the change in the backpass rule would make football evolve so that a goalkeeper would need to be as capable with his feet as any defender , but @entity90 appears to be the first to truly support this			1
his skills were not required as much this time but he remained engaged and alive to the @entity131 danger			0
it also helps that when needed to perform conventional duties he is about the best around , too			0
a professional rush goalie ? we could be seeing the first of a breed			0
had @entity77 found his range in the seventh minute , however , there is probably little @entity90 could have done			1
@entity70 moved superbly to put in a cross for @entity77 which the striker should have at least got on target			2
@entity8 ’s defence does not offer up too many opportunities and it was not until the 34th minute that @entity90 needed to fully demonstrate his talent			1
missed opportunity : @entity16 winger @entity76 ( second from left ) loses possession as an attack breaks down booked : @entity8 midfielder @entity97 ( right ) is shown a yellow card for a foul in the second half get it out ! @entity16 defender @entity67 ( left ) makes a clearance under pressure from @entity99 interested spectators : the girlfriends of @entity100 ( left ) , @entity318 ( centre ) and @entity7 ( right ) watch the action inside the @entity21 on the attack : @entity324 midfielder @entity70 ( left ) prepares to deliver a cross into the @entity8 box @entity76 put in a cross which @entity70 met , forcing a stunning , one - handed save			1
the ball flew up and dropped for @entity77 , but @entity8 ’s massed ranks deflected it over			1
it was a similar story in the 42nd minute when a fine cross by @entity69 – who has looked a different player at this @entity14 than he did for @entity333 for much of last season – picked out @entity77 only for his header to be blocked by @entity52 on its way to goal			1
tuesday ’s semi-final will be @entity33 ’s second as coach of @entity8 , and he was also assistant to @entity340 in 2006			1
he will be aware , though , that he is yet to reach the final itself			0
the thought of taking the big luggage to @entity20 will not have occurred though ? and as this @entity14 approaches it peak with @entity168 long departed , you want to know what is funny ? the way the @entity348 talk about planning for the @entity349 in 2016 as if they are the only ones who have thought of it			1
@entity8 do these things differently			2
you never know , that might work , too .			0

@entity358 defender @entity52 headed the winner in 13th minute
@entity90 saved late on from @entity77 to secure victory
@entity33 's side will play in their fourth consecutive @entity14 semi-final
@entity8 will face the winners of @entity222 vs @entity367 in @entity20
