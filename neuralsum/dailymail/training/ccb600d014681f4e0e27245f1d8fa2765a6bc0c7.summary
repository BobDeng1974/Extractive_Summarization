' @entity12 said that now the @entity31 is spending $ 2 billion to train police in @entity101 and asked why federal funds could not be transfered to train school guards to protect schools in the @entity31			1

@entity12 also trained his sights on mental health care in the @entity31			2
' we have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed			0
we have no national database of these lunatics , ' said @entity12			2
