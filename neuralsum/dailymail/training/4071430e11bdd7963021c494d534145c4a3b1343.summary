part of the @entity1 was dramatically evacuated on wednesday after an alarm warned of a possible leak of toxic ammonia			1
crew members in the @entity7 section of the station were forced to take refuge in the @entity11 part of the @entity1 while the problem was being investigated			1
but later on wednesday the crew were able to return to the @entity7 modules after it was revealed that the reading was a false alarm , letting the astronauts and cosmonauts return to life as normal			1
clockwise from the left : @entity37 , @entity38 , commander @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 part of the @entity1 ( pictured ) was dramatically evacuated wednesday after a possible leak of ' harmful ' ammonia in the @entity7 section , forcing astronauts to flee			1
however , @entity29 said the leak was likely just a faulty sensor reading , and the crew were able to move back later on wednesday the @entity51 , @entity51 , had said a possible ' escape of hazardous substances from an air conditioning unit ' was discharged into the station 's atmosphere at around 8.45am gmt ( 3.45am est ) on wednesday			1
following an alarm , the six crew members aboard the @entity1 were told to don masks and take refuge in the @entity11 segment of the station			1
they then closed the hatch to the @entity7 segment to prevent leaking ammonia - which could be hazardous to the health of the astronauts - from contaminating the rest of the station			1
by wednesday afternoon , the astronauts were back in the @entity7 part of the orbiting outpost			1
' hey everybody , thanks for your concern , ' @entity73 astronaut @entity42 said via @entity78			0
' we 're all safe & doing well in the @entity11 segment			1
' ammonia on the @entity1 is used to cool the station as part of the @entity84			1
it is circulated in loops on the exterior of the iss and moves through the large radiators on the exterior of the station , releasing heat from them into space			0
although extremely useful as a coolant , ammonia is also poisonous to breathe - and thus a potential leak could be a serious health concern for astronauts on board			2
the ' unscheduled excitement , ' as @entity29 called it , occurred around 9am gmt ( 4am est ) , well into the station crew 's workday			1
as alarms blared , the astronauts followed emergency procedures in slapping on oxygen masks , taking cover in the @entity11 quarters , then sealing the hatches between the @entity7 and @entity11 sides			1
at the same time , flight controllers at @entity29 's @entity112 in @entity113 turned off non-essential equipment			2
within minutes , @entity115 gave an all - clear , but sent the astronauts scurrying back over to the @entity11 side again when there was more evidence of a possible leak of the coolant			1
the highly toxic liquid ammonia , flowing outside the space station , is used to cool electronics			0
flight controllers originally feared it had gotten into the water system running inside			0
now , it 's believed that a failed card in a computer - relay box was the culprit			0
' the @entity7 segment on the @entity1 is currently isolated			1
the crew is safe and located in the @entity11 segment , ' @entity51 said in a statement at the time of the discovery			1
an official added : ' the crew 's safety was provided for thanks to the co-ordinated and quick actions of the cosmonauts and astronauts themselves , as well as operative control groups in @entity147 and @entity113			2
' the current crew on board the @entity1 had to take refuge in the @entity11 part of the station after a possible ammonia leak this morning			1

the @entity7 parts of the station , shown in yellow , may have an ammonia leak , causing them to be evacuated - but this has not yet been confirmed			2
note the @entity165 shown here is an addition to the @entity1 that was never launched the entire crew of @entity35 are now seeking refuge while ground controllers at @entity29 and elsewhere figure out the extent of the problem			1
pictured from left to right in this promotional crew photo are @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity37 , @entity155 and @entity42 construction of the @entity1 began on 20 november 1998			2
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			2
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity188 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,800 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity188 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
according to @entity193 an unscheduled spacewalk may have been required to fix the leak - but this is not likely to be needed now			0
this would not have been the first time an ammonia leak has been fixed by a spacewalk , though			0
back in 2013 two astronauts had to plug a leak outside the station			2
in the event that an evacuation had been needed , the crew would have been required to get into the two @entity206 spacecraft currently docked to the @entity1 and return to @entity188			2
the chances of this being required , though , were extremely low			0
the latest emergency comes after recent hints from @entity11 officials that they could abandon the @entity1 in 2020 despite a @entity7 desire to see the station continue until 2028			1
@entity11 is thought to want to end its involvement in the @entity1 to begin construction of a new space station that it will use as a gateway to the moon and possibly other destinations			1

' hazardous substances ' thought to have been discharged
crew in @entity7 section were forced to take refuge in @entity11 part of the @entity1
@entity7 segment was been isolated and is being *assessed* by mission control
crew had to don masks as they moved from @entity7 to @entity11 segment
were forced to abandon module twice as fears of a second leak emerged
@entity29 says *incident* is likely due to faulty sensor or *anomalous* reading
astronauts are now able to go back into the @entity7 segment
