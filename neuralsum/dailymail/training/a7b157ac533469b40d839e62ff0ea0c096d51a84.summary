by @entity0 last updated at 7:09 am on 21st october 2011 at first glance , you could be forgiven for thinking that a group of painters and decorators had left behind a pile of their paint - spattered dust - sheets			2
in fact this collection of crumpled paper , suspended plastic bags and scattered chalk is the work of one of the four finalists in this year 's annual @entity18 competition			1
the other artists ' work includes enamel paintings of mundane scenes including a dog dirt bin and a rundown pub , shaky split - screen videos of tower blocks and a piece titled ' do words have voices ' which features a battered and scratched wooden table			1
what do you think of it so far ? @entity34 's rubbish bin vying for a £ 25,000 prize controversial choice ? @entity38 's ' @entity37 ' features plastic bags suspended from the ceiling of the impressive @entity42 art centre very contemporary : visitors are able to wander around and under @entity38 's work on display at @entity42 's @entity46 the exhibition for the world 's most controversial prize for modern art launches in @entity42 's @entity46 tomorrow			1
this is the first time the @entity18 has been held at a @entity53 venue in its 27 - year history			1
but the displays are certain to generate the same amount of criticism about whether they deserve to be defined as art. the prize is notorious for rows over the artistic merit of its exhibits - which have included an unmade bed , balls of elephant dung and a room with a light turning on and off			1
this year 's finalists are only slightly less controversial			1
@entity38 's innovative approach to sculpture sees her suspending plastic bags from the ceilings of galleries and using small scrunched up balls of dough in her pieces			2
multiple angles : @entity38 's works , on display at the @entity81 in @entity42 , can also be observed through sheets of glass splattered with paint she selects things she ' can not help but use ' which include powder - paint , plaster , crushed chalk , @entity91 , lipstick , topsoil , sugar paper , balsa wood , eye shadow , nail varnish and moisturiser			1
another @entity99 , @entity34 , has created atmospheric , angular sculptural installations which have philosophical names like ' do the words have voices			0
' @entity104 uses still and moving images as well as sound to portray abstract urban environments			0
she makes her technical equipment a part of her sculptures , clearly displaying the audio - visual tools			2
fellow nominee : @entity34 's philosophically named ' do the words have voices ' is an atmospheric , angular sculpture and is on show in @entity42 impressive and imposing : a gallery worker looks at the piece from a different angle @entity121 's naturalistic paintings of urban landscapes , council estates and abandoned houses are small in scale but give out a strong message			2
he paints the landscape of his adolescent life			0
each scene exists within a half - mile radius of @entity121 's childhood home on the @entity133 estate in @entity134			1
the @entity46 , located on the south bank of the @entity136 in @entity137 , has a world class modern art collection of its own - as well as offering almost unparalleled views over the city of @entity42			1
it is the @entity143 's largest display space for contemporary art outside @entity145 , and was created from a derelict 1940s grain warehouse as part of a drive - spearheaded by @entity137 council in the 1990s - for transformation through culture			1
room with a view : @entity18 finalist @entity104 's installations come with an impressive backdrop of the city of @entity42 screen work : @entity157 's screens are suspended on metal poles and use still and moving images as well as sound to portray abstract urban scenes the @entity163 , the @entity164 and the @entity165 were all products of the same vision			2
@entity46 's role was to be an ' art factory ' of international stature , with a constantly changing schedule of exhibitions and no permanent collection			1
opened in july 2002 , it has received four million visitors and now has 400,000 annually			0
chief curator sir @entity176 said he expected to be inundated with visitors to the gallery , housed in a former grain warehouse on the south bank of the @entity136			0
he said : ' it is a great achievement for @entity137 and @entity46 to be the first ones to present the @entity18 outside the boundaries of the @entity184 in its history			2
' there is a huge appetite for contemporary art here in the @entity190			0
' @entity46 itself gets about half a million visitors a year but this is a fantastic opportunity to see what is probably the most prestigious prize for contemporary art in the world			1
' the @entity18 has only once been held outside @entity145 , at the @entity184 in @entity198 in 2007			0
hosting the event would boost @entity46 's profile and help engage the wider public , sir @entity176 said			0
' it will mean an enormous amount to the area , ' he added			0
' the @entity18 has become almost a household name and what a great celebration of some of the best art being produced in @entity143			0
' i think we will be inundated with visitors and i look forward to everybody entering the debate that surrounds the prize			0
' cameras at the ready : there is already a lot of interest in @entity18 finalist @entity121 's naturalistic paintings of the urban landscape where he grew up urban scenes : @entity121 's ' @entity223 ' ( left ) and some local garages , these are a few of the images on show at the @entity46 in @entity42 he said the north east 's rough and ready reputation was undeserved and that the area was a hotbed for contemporary art. he said : ' there are many artists living and working here and there are three strong art schools here			1
' @entity46 and a number of fellow organisations have been instrumental in keeping artists here			0
' new art is being made here all the time			2
' the exhibition opens to the public tomorrow			0
the £ 25,000 winner will be announced live on @entity245 on december 5 .			0

other exhibits include a painting of a dog dirt bin and a pub
