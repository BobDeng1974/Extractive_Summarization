an anonymous post to website @entity10 - which people use to save text they would like to paste elsewhere later - contained a list of hundreds of email log - ins and passwords the hacker said were linked to @entity0 accounts			1

an unfortunate slogan : cloud storage site @entity0 has denied claims it has been hacked after an anonymous account posted what it claims are the usernames and passwords of hundreds of the site 's users the hacker has asked for donations in digital currency @entity28 in exchange for revealing the alleged flaws in @entity0 's security - and revealing more account details			1
' as more @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is donated , more @entity10 pastes will appear , ' the hacker wrote			1
however , @entity0 has denied that its service has been compromised			1

' recent news articles claiming that @entity0 was hacked are n't true			1
your stuff is safe , ' he said			0
' the usernames and passwords referenced in these articles were stolen from unrelated services , not @entity0			2

the @entity82 has been investigating the matter , while @entity84 admitted that certain celebrity accounts had been compromised			0
but the company said none of the cases it had investigated were due to any breach in @entity84 's systems including @entity79 or @entity91			0
the @entity93 's new digital head accused celebrities whose naked photos have been leaked online of being ' dumb ' for having taken them in the first place			0
@entity98 , who will become the @entity100 commissioner for digital economy and society next month , said : ‘ if someone is dumb enough as a celebrity to take a nude photo of themselves and put it online , they surely ca n't expect us to protect them			0
’ he later added : ‘ everybody has a right to @entity112 @entity113 wants to make cloud computing safer , ' but did not apologise for his earlier comments			0
@entity116 is being threatened with a £ 60 million lawsuit from female celebrities for allegedly profiting from the biggest nude photo - hacking scandal in history			2
the search giant has been accused of failing to remove the private images and ‘ making millions from the victimisation of women ’ , according to a legal letter obtained by the @entity126			2

' mr @entity36 went on to encourage users to increase the security on their @entity0 account , citing this attack as a good reason to turn on two - step verification			1
this adds a second layer of security to an account and is used by many other online services			2
in this instance it requires an additional code entry that is sent to a user 's phone when they try to log in , as well as the password			2

@entity178 , ceo of online security platform egress has warned consumers and businesses are risking themselves through what he calls ' bad habits '			0
' another day , another example of why people should not trust insecure online collaboration platforms , such as @entity0			2
it is not just personal information that is at risk but commercially sensitive data as well , ' he said			0
' as it becomes increasingly consumerised , people are not only bringing their own devices to work , they are bringing their bad habits too			0
how often have you been communicating with a colleague or partner and needed to share a large file , and the easiest option has been to simply send it via @entity0 ? it is becoming common practice			2
' incidents such as these highlight the risk to data security that this creates and should act as a wake - up call for organisations to start looking at the processes within their business			0
' financially motived : the hacker asked for donations in @entity28 ( pictured ) in exchange for revealing the alleged flaws in @entity0 's security , as well as revealing more account details @entity219 from security firm @entity218 explained that is the casual nature of some users when it comes to passwords that places them at risk to attacks like this			1
' cybercriminals were able to simply log in to @entity0 accounts using the usernames and passwords they hacked or purchased elsewhere on the internet			1
cybercriminals know that many consumers are not aware of security best practice , or choose to ignore it , by using the same @entity241 / email address and password to login to multiple online services , ' he said			0
' this password reuse is exacerbated by the increasing volume and success rates cybercriminals are enjoying with advanced phishing campaigns such as longlining , many of which are " @entity251 " where the phish email sends the recipient to a fake website resembling the login page of a legitimate online service , often @entity257 , @entity0 and @entity258			1

we 've checked and these are not associated with @entity0 accounts , ' the cloud firm said .			1
