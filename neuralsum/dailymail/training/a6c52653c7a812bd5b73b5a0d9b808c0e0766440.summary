by @entity0 a new @entity2 tool has been installed on the search engine site which allows users to compare different foods - right down to their nutritional information			1
the tool is designed so that if a user type in two types of food , with the word ' vs ' in between , or the two foods with the word ' compare ' preceding it , they will see a chart revealing the foods make up , comparing them side by side			1
the tool even measures the different foods based on how they are prepared and what is in them , as well as portion size			2
the tool appears automatically when you type in two foods with the word ' vs ' in between them , and displays the most relevant nutritional information available in a comparison for example , typing in ' sweet potato mash vs mashed potato ' will show you that sweet potatoes have 4.2 grams of sugar per 100 grams and mashed potatoes have just 0.5 grams for the same portion			1
but scroll down and you can see that sweet potato mash beats mashed potatoes in the amount of potassium , calcium content and vitamin a they have			0
a drop down menu allows you to change portion or preparation methods or additions to see how this changes the fat or sugar content			0
if you changed the method of making mashed potatoes to ' potato , mashed with milk and margarine ' the fat content will rise to 4.7 grams , whereas if you change it to ' mashed with milk and butter ' it rises again to 5 grams of fat			0
the tool can even be used for bizarre combinations of different food groups , such as ' bacon vs grape ' the tool can be used to compare anything , from ' pizza vs pie ' to ' apple vs grape '			1
even concordant foods from different food groups can be compared , such as ' bacon vs grape ' , for those concocting strange food combinations , or for those who are just curious			2
the tool is made with nutritional information taken from the @entity82 @entity81 , and was installed after the success of @entity2 's original nutrition search tool that was released in may 2013 , according to @entity2 spokeswoman @entity85			2
in an interview with @entity88 ms @entity85 said : ' we noticed that people were doing a lot of food and nutrition searches â € ” multi-step searches on one food and another food			0
' these things are often compared to one another , so we thought , why do n't we make it easy ? ' some foods have far more information than others , and many comparisons reveal how much artificial ingredients some foods have the nutritional information was gathered by @entity2 from the @entity82 @entity81 and the tool was quietly installed on at the end of last year after the success of their original nutritional information tool ms @entity85 added that @entity2 's algorithm is always calculating ' what might be useful to you when you ask a question '			1
she said : ' there are plenty more complicated food , recipe and nutrition questions to help people answer			0
we want to give as many answers to as many complicated questions as possible			0
' the tool was developed and quietly installed at the end of 2013 , and was shortly followed by another tool that lets users access restaurant menus much quicker			0
for the second tool they have already accessed menus of 75 per cent of the restaurants in the @entity82 the tool , which is activated from typing directly into the @entity2 search bar , also works in conjunction with @entity138 and @entity139 facts to compare other things , like movies , except the data will be used to compare directors , budget and earnings .			1

tool activated by typing foods into @entity2 search bar with the word ' vs ' between them
compares food and ingredients based on their nutritional value
can compare almost anything , from regular combinations to weird ones
also gives nutritional info based on preparation and cooking method
for example , fried bacon will be a lot more fattening than baked bacon
