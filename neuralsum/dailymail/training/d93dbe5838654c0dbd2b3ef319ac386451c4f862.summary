a summary of the ' @entity12 ' series posted on the @entity14 website reads : ' what if you knew your newest addition could suddenly be subtracted ? your bundle of joy no longer yours			1

@entity28 and @entity29 face an agonising wait after adopting baby @entity31 @entity32 , senior vice president of programming for @entity14 , told the @entity33 : ' i do n’t think we ’re going to scare people out of the [ adoption ] process			1
' the desire to have a child and create a family is deeply rooted in many people			1
' and i think if you have that desire , you ’re going to pursue it , knowing that there ’s some uncertainty in the process			1
' and participants of the show also believe it successfully demonstrates how adoption can be a difficult process for all parties			2
@entity28 who appears in one episode with his domestic partner , @entity29 , said : ' i think we are showing what true life is			2
' @entity60 , 18 , said she often thought about taking her daughter back during the 30 - day period as the couple are tracked during the 30 - day window their anxiety builds as they realise their new daughter could be taken away at any moment as her birth mother , 18 - year - old @entity60 , has the right to back out of the arrangement at any time			2
@entity28 adds : ' when @entity31 was put in our arms , all these hopes and dreams started bubbling up for us			2
' but while you [ still ] have those 30 days , it ’s always in the back of your mind : ‘ what if @entity82 calls ? ’ ' meanwhile @entity60 revealed that she often thought about taking her daughter back and raising her on welfare and food stamps			0
' there would be times i would be in my room by myself looking at pictures or watching videos and i would start crying thinking , ‘ why do i hurt so much ? i miss her			0
i need her back in my life			0
@entity28 and @entity29 were anxious that baby @entity31 could be taken away at any moment during the 30 - day window ' but at the same time , another little voice snapped in the back of my head and said , ‘ you ca n’t take care of a baby			0
