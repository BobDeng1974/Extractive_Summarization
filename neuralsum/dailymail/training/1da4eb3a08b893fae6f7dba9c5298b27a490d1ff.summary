by @entity1 reporter published : 08:55 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 09:10 est , 28 november 2012 two nurses have filed a $ 200,000 civil lawsuit against the son of the late sen. @entity5 after he allegedly assaulted them while trying to take his newborn son out of the maternity ward			1
the lawsuit comes just one week after the criminal charges against @entity5 were dropped , yet the nurses are still accusing him of negligence , assault and battery , as well as causing them emotional and physical distress			1
the incident at the heart of the legal dramas is when @entity5 tried in january to take his newborn son from @entity20 in @entity21 , saying he just wanted the two - day - old boy , @entity22 , to get some fresh air			1
next battle : @entity25 , seen here with his wife at an april court appearance , had the criminal charges dropped but now faces a $ 200,000 lawsuit from the nurses involved several nurses objected , saying his request would violate hospital policy which prevents people from taking newborns out of the maternity ward for fear of kidnapping or infection			2
@entity5 tried to leave anyway , and two nurses claimed he hurt them as they blocked his way			1
the @entity42 says the lawsuit was filed by nurses @entity45 and @entity46 on tuesday , a week after @entity5 was acquitted of child endangerment and harassment charges			1
both testified during the criminal proceedings			0
the newspaper said @entity5 vowed to fight the lawsuit and called it an attempt to extort money from his family			2
the lawsuit comes as little shock , as @entity5 's lawyer @entity59 said that the nurses had been told that any potential lawsuit for damages would have a better chance if a criminal conviction came first			1
family : @entity25 , pictured with his wife @entity66 and his son @entity67 , is the 10th of @entity5 's 11 children ' we were attacked ' : @entity71 , left , and @entity72 , right , were involved in the alleged scuffle on january 7 at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity74 violence : one of the nurses is seen on the ground after she was allegedly kicked by @entity5 at the hospital elevator clearly that did not happen , as the @entity82 judge @entity81 , who heard the case without a jury , ruled that @entity5 broke no laws			1
judge @entity81 said testimony showed the baby was not in danger except from the nurses ' actions			2
@entity59 said after the decision , ' given the barrage of public attention , it took a great deal of courage from this judge and we really do appreciate it			0
' the hospital confrontation resulted in a series of alarms , including a ' code pink , ' which is used to signal a baby 's abduction			0
in his closing argument , @entity59 called the alarm ' preposterous			0
' confrontation : @entity5 , in the blue jacket , can be seen going for the elevator in the scuffle with one of the nurses hospital : mr @entity5 is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk he said the nurses overreacted to @entity5 's request and when they realized the hospital would investigate , they ' join together , get their stories straight and pressure the district attorney 's office to bring charges			1
' @entity124 testified that @entity5 twisted her arm as she tried to block him from going through a door to a stairwell			2
@entity129 said @entity5 kicked her as she reached for the baby in @entity5 's arms			1
@entity59 said it was a push rather than a kick and was an instinctive reaction of a father trying to protect his baby			0
many kids : @entity25 , who would not be born until a number of years after this photo , was only one when his father was shot siblings : @entity5 was shot dead in 1968 , and he is seen here with seven of his 11 children in 1964 , right @entity5 also fell when that happened but kept hold of the baby			1
prosecutors said his actions endangered the infant			0
' the fact that the baby was not injured is a miracle , ' assistant district attorney @entity151 said			0
she said @entity5 ' resorted to violence instead of simply complying with a request			0
' @entity5 's wife , @entity66 , accompanied him to the trial			0
a state investigation , including a visit to the @entity5 home in @entity161 , found no evidence of child abuse			2
