by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 11:23 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 15:47 est , 22 january 2013 most babies of 12 months of age can not walk , while their vocabulary might just about stretch to a few goos and perhaps the odd ‘ @entity7 ’			1
however , a new hi - tech tablet for babies will go on sale at a price of £ 84.99 in time for @entity12			1
the @entity13 – effectively an @entity14 for babies – was launched today at the 2013 @entity16 , a showcase for what manufacturers hope will be the big sellers of the year			1
@entity20 , 2 , tries out the £ 84.99 innotab 2 , with the help of @entity22			1
the tablet is aimed at babies and children from 1 year to 4 years the @entity26 has a library of apps that can downloaded using the touchscreen , babies will , in theory , be able to navigate their way around educational games identifying colours or animals , complete with sound			1
it comes in a hard rubberised case that protects it from being chewed or dropped , while there is music to soothe and ebooks to flick through with parents			1
just as with an @entity14 there will be a library of apps to download that , in theory , will allow the baby to use it as they develop until the age of nine , when , no doubt , they will be screaming for a real @entity14			1
the @entity54 is made by toy tech company @entity55 , which claims it has spotted a gap in the market in terms of providing a tablet for youngsters under three			1
the device will appear to the ‘ @entity62 ’ who are set on raising the next generation of brain surgeons , nuclear physicists , city bankers and concert pianists			2
the firm describes the tablet as a ‘ must have gadget ’ and boasts : ‘ parents no longer need to be worried about their child with a tablet			2
‘ @entity54 features a baby proof design and tailored apps and content			1
’ the innovation provides telling evidence as to how technology and tablets are replacing old fashioned toys , whether it is rocking horses and @entity84 or @entity85 and @entity86			1
sales of traditional toys that involve handling , building or the imagination fell by 1per cent last year as youngsters switched to screens			1
traditionalists will rue the change in culture , for many technology based games involve solitary play , rather than groups , and leave little room for imagination			2
@entity55 's @entity22 with the @entity101 , which is aimed at babies and children from 1 year to 4 years old @entity55 ’s @entity22 said : ‘ it has a special casing that means that you can leave it alone with a child and they can chew it and they wo n’t damage it at all			2
‘ it is pre-loaded with 12 musical melodies that will soothe a child			2
' it also has a cartridge that teaches the recognition of animals , such as an elephant and explain what it is and what noise it makes			2
‘ it is educational as well as designed to entertain and soothe			2
the baby can use it on their own or with the parent			0
a 12 month old can use the touchscreen			0
’ @entity20 , 2 , tries out the @entity26 2			0
it has a special case designed to withstand being dropped one of the games sees the screen showered with golden stars which disappear one by one as they are touched with tiny fingers			1
the tablet also has a built in video camera to allow parents to capture their baby at play			0
miss @entity22 said it was far better than simply putting a child in front of a tv screen because it has interactive elements , while it can be used by a parent and child			0
@entity146 , 8 , with the most expensive toy at the fair , @entity150 's animatronix dinosaur , @entity151 £ 9,000 , and the @entity152 behind @entity151 £ 8,000 @entity153 , 11 , poses in the @entity155 board at the fair , made to promote the £ 16 board game that accompanies the popular tv show ‘ a parent and child can work together to learn words , colours and shapes , ’ she said			0
‘ we have had feedback from parents that there was a gap in the market for a product like this that is specifically designed for children aged one to three			0
we are living in a world of technology and everyone is using the @entity14 and it is nice to encourage children to learn in this way			0
a @entity180 character is helped up a flight of stairs during the 2013 @entity183 ‘ we are not saying this is a replacement for a book , but it is nice that when you have an @entity188 to see visuals that go with it and can be explored			1
’ however , @entity191 , of @entity192 , which is a craft based product for young children , suggested many parents would be alarmed at the idea of a tablet for a baby			0
‘ i think it is crazy			0
at 12 months most babies can hardly walk , ’ she said			0
traditional toys and play habits have been proven for generations of children to be effective in developing skills , imagination and concentration			1
’ @entity153 , 11 , with one of the props from the £ 16 horrible histories battle game miss @entity191 , based in @entity213 , a textile design teacher who encourages children to learn to sew from the age of five , said : ‘ simple things like pinning , splitting thread in half , successfully threading a needle or tying a knot are all really useful skills for children to learn			0
‘ @entity224 is such an important skill , once learned it is never forgotten			0
' fingers become more dextrous , fine motor skills are developed , hand to eye co-ordination improves as does concentration			0

@entity13 can download apps , and comes in a case to protect it from being dropped ( and chewed )
comes with ebooks and music *preloaded*
*revealed* *alongside* dozens of must - have toys at the 2013 @entity16
