they have watched everything from hippies drinking their own urine to @entity5 slurring			2
but today the presenters of @entity8 ’s @entity7 struggled to articulate some rather hair - raising questions while talking to a man who has sex with cars			1
@entity13 told presenters @entity14 and @entity16 that although he has made love to 700 cars in his lifetime , he has now settled down with the ‘ love of his life ’ - a @entity23 he calls ‘ vanilla ’			1
while presenters @entity14 and @entity16 managed to ask probing questions about the details of his sexual history with four wheeled machines , there were clearly moments when it was difficult for the pair not to crack up			1
mr @entity13 boasted he has bedded @entity50 , @entity51 , had threesomes in car parks and car showrooms , and has even had brief flings with helicopters and planes			1
@entity57 is considered a crime in the @entity59 , with perpetrators put on the sexual offenders register			2
as a teenager , mr @entity13 began to look at car magazines in the same way some men devour pornography , before finally losing his virginity to his neighbour ’s @entity23 at age 14			1
he said : ‘ i got tempted one night to step outside to gently caress the car			1
‘ it did something for me , woke something up inside of me			2
’ once this desire had been awakened , he began to seek out cars that he was attracted to			1
he said : ‘ i look back at that thinking that was really risky business			2
that ’s the history , yes , in fact , i can not deny that there were a number of neighbourhood car lots			1
i would go over to visit			0
’ when asked how he makes love to a car , he clarified that he is not attracted to any kind of penetration			1
he said : ‘ it ’s hugging and holding the shape of the car close to me and talking to it a little bit			1
‘ the rest is just physical satisfaction ... hat ’s done next to the car			1
’ he added that he always kept his clothes on			0
‘ i basically just unzipped			0
i ’ve never got naked on a car – in public ’ he said			1
mr @entity13 did have human girlfriends in secondary school and university , and one who he met as ag grown adult living in @entity103 in 1971 , although he was never able to consummate the relationship			1
he said : ‘ it was not a thoroughly satisfying experience			0
to have sex with a car , he holds the body of the car , strokes and caresses it , and then masturbates while his libido has calmed as he grows older , he has a ' deep love ' for his favourite cars , vanilla , @entity116 and @entity117 and worries he may crash or they may break down mr @entity13 boasts he has had sex with 700 cars , as well as helicopters and planes , but has now settled down with a white 1969 @entity23 called vanilla who he says is the ' love of his life ' ‘ i never got so involved like my brothers did and spent the night with them			1
’ now , he says his white @entity127 is his girlfriend and the love of his life			1
‘ she certainly has become special			0
i got her in 1982 so it will be 30 years on december 23rd ' he said			0
the pair ‘ met ’ when mr @entity13 was involved in a relationship with another @entity23 called @entity134			1
but when he laid eyes on @entity127 , it was love at first sight			2
he said : ‘ i first met her , before i got her , when i lived here in @entity142 , they had the local @entity144 ’s witness church driver around in a white @entity23 handing out literature			1
‘ ‘ there was something about that white ’ 74 beetle when they pulled up to hand out their literature , that while they were talking , i could n’t take my eyes off of her			2
’ years later , he saw an advert for a similar white beetle available to buy			2
when he went to the dealership he was shocked to find it had the same numberplate and was indeed the same car			2
he now greets vanilla every morning			2
they ' get intimate ' on his own private property , but he is mindful not to be seen in public			1
mr @entity13 also is involved with a 1973 @entity167 , named @entity116 , and 1993 @entity168 , named @entity117 , but @entity127 is ‘ very forgiving ’ and does n’t get jealous			1
although he says he understands that cars are not conscious beings , he feels strongly about them and truly believes they are in a long - term relationship			1
he is the only one who is allowed to wash his cars , which is like giving them a bath , he says			2
he likes to talk to them , play music and ' suds them all up ' ‘ i realise that “ @entity13 , in your heart and soul you know that these are cars ” - but when i hold them in my arms i do feel an energy that comes from each one of them			1
‘ lately at my age , the libidinal energies have calmed			2
beyond that , there ’s a very deep love that i would n’t want anything to separate us after 32 years			1
’ his feeling are so strong he says he would be ‘ devastated ’ if there were ever to be a mechanical problem or a crash involving vanilla			1
he says his fear means he drives extremely carefully , almost to the point of paranoia			0
once he became livid after a mechanical engineer did a shoddy job and @entity163 broke down during a long road trip			0
while he allows mechanics to fix cars , he has a strict rule : he is the only one allowed to wash them			2
‘ i prefer to do that myself , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s like giving her a bath			0
i talk to her , play music , suds her all up			0
’ professor @entity220 , head of psychology at @entity222 , told @entity223 : professor @entity220 says mechaphilia is not strictly seen as a mental health problem @entity226 is quite rare and unusual , and not much is known about how the prevalence of mechaphiles within society , other than they do seem to occur everywhere around the globe , and the cause is not specific to specific cultures			0
although mechaphilia is an extremely unusual and rare behaviour , the sexual attraction to objects and mechanical equipment is not strictly seen as a mental health problem			0
the @entity238 ( which acts like a physician ’s recipe book for diagnosing health conditions ) states that @entity226 is a non-specific paraphilia , with a paraphilia being a type of sexual attraction or predilection that runs alongside ' conventional ' sexual behaviours			0
paraphilia are only seen to be viewed as such when the sexual feelings or behaviours become problematic , often leading to depression or anxiety within the individual , or when the behaviour itself ( or the attempted avoidance of such behaviour ) causes serious problems with day to day functioning			0
there are literally dozens of other forms of unusual paraphilia running from a-z including @entity264 ( attraction to amputees ) and @entity267 ( an attraction to seeing animals in pain )			0
some of these paraphilia are more psychiatrically concerning than others – especially if they involve the pleasure of witnessing or inflicting pain or suffering in other adults , children or animals , such as @entity278 – a pleasure derived from eating human flesh			0
in comparison then , mechaphilia ( sometimes known specifically as autophilia , when an individual develops either sexual or emotional attachments to vehicles – most commonly cars ) seems quite innocuous and harmless – with many mechaphiles explaining that they do not hurt anyone by their behaviours			2
indeed @entity13 has spoken quite openly , and at times graphically , about his behaviour , going to great lengths to point out that he has had relationships with humans before and that he is not homosexual , but that he just prefers cars			1
ever since @entity298 ’s @entity297 was released in 1927 , some have been concerned that the sexualisation of robots – maschinenmensch as it was in the movie – could result in mecaphilia becoming a commonplace occurrence			0
some mechaphiles may find only vehicles arousing , while some may find both humans and vehicles stimulating and can try to combine both of them into their sexual activities			0
what does seem quite common in many mechanophiles , of which approximately 8590 % are male , seems to be an extreme form of relationship avoidance and failed romances in early formative years			0
but that is also true for the ' normal ' non-mechanaphile population too			0
while such romantic failures are part of many peoples ’ growing up experiences , some find it just too painful and develop alternative feelings and emotions for other objects ( even animals ) that can not hurt or reject in the way that humans possibly can			0
although some mechaphiles do possess the insight to say that they found ' human relationships ' too difficult or painful , just as many are often in denial about such difficulties in their pasts			0
@entity226 , like most other paraphilia , can best be viewed as the result of a disturbance in the psychosexual development , whereby healthy sexual and emotional feelings are subconsciously transferred to objects that are safer or less ' emotionally risky ' than other people			0
if this occurs at a crucial time on the formative developmental period , the reward the mechaphile gets ( sexual / emotional release without fear of rejection ) can be quite powerful and addictive , which will reinforce future mecaphilic behaviours .			0
