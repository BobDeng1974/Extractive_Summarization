cat cafés took off in @entity51 in the noughties , and ms @entity22 says she sees similarities in @entity54 due both cities ' congested living conditions , people 's time constraints and landlords that do n't take kindly to tenants owning their own pets			1
ms @entity22 , who is looking at potential sites in @entity54 's @entity63 , says she has already found 15 felines to start with , all of which will come from the @entity67 in @entity68			1
cat cafes have been a massive hit in the east with hundreds now open in @entity31 , @entity3 and @entity7 feline friends : both cat and customer feel pampered and loved in a cat cafe furry nice : as a nation of cat lovers , a cat cafe would allow those who ca n't own a pet to have contact and play with felines whenever they liked king of the cafe : the cats would be specially chosen to ensure they enjoy human company , and the cafe would provide a home to cats who do n't have one she said : ‘ if something exists you can probably get it in @entity54 , but there ’s one thing that lots of people living in @entity54 ca n’t have – a kitty			1

‘ we thought long and hard about who would really benefit from having a cat café in @entity54			0
' i see commuters walking on their way to and from the station stopping to pet the neighbourhood cats , and since i am unable to own a cat myself due to my current flat and long hours i understand the desire to have a cat around			0
' to stop the animals getting stressed , there will be a ' small cover charge ' for customers to encourage them to linger over their beverages for a little longer			2
ms @entity22 said : ‘ cat welfare is really important to us			1
in particular , we want to make sure we can house cats who do n't have a home to go to			2
‘ we tried to figure out a solution where the cats do n’t get too stressed out , which is why we ’ve introduced the cover charge			2
' that way , people can stay as long as they like without feeling like they ’re against the clock , which works for the cats because it takes them a little time to get used to people			0
’ @entity157 's @entity24 will have an ' opulent @entity159 decor ' to help both customers and animals ' relax in the height of luxury '			1
