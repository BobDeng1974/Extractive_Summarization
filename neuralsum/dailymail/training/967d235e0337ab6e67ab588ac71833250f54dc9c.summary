the mayor of two @entity2 villages has claimed that up to half of their residents will move to the @entity6 when restrictions are lifted in january			1
@entity8 said he believed ‘ 50 per cent ’ of the 1,100 people in poverty - stricken @entity10 and @entity10 could travel to @entity6 in search of higher salaries – and the generous welfare system – in the @entity14			1
many have already moved to @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , but the mayor said the @entity6 would soon become a more attractive destination , with ‘ better conditions ’ , when the borders are relaxed			1
mass exodus : @entity24 , far right , his son @entity25 , third left , who needs drugs for a heart condition and other family members from @entity10 , @entity2 among those keen to move are 170 @entity31 who live in abject poverty on the outskirts of the villages , with no running water in their homes and as many as 20 people sharing a three - room house			1
one of them , father - of - seven @entity24 , 37 , said he hoped to move to @entity6 after learning that he could be eligible for housing benefits and @entity43 care			1
pointing to a shaggy brown and white goat , tethered to an outhouse , he said : ‘ in january , the only thing left in the village will be the goat			0
’ basic conditions : @entity51 , left , and family outside their home mr @entity8 , the mayor of @entity10 , which encompasses these villages , said : ‘ i think it is possible that half of the people in @entity10 and @entity10 , the @entity2 and @entity31 people , will go to the @entity6 next year			1
‘ in particular , the young people will go , because they do n’t have anything here			2
they will go to work in agriculture and construction , but also for the benefits			0
‘ my advice to @entity6 would be not to give people everything			1
you should take care because , if everybody goes to the @entity6 , what will you do ? can you afford it ? ‘ people do not have big salaries here and will obviously be interested in the salaries and the benefits in @entity79			2
’ reflecting growing tensions in @entity2 , he singled out the @entity31 community as the most likely to move , saying : ‘ it is not a bad thing for us that they want to go somewhere else in @entity87			0
grinding poverty : a girl with a muddy face hides behind a woman in the village where many families live in clay huts ‘ they will go to the @entity6 , get the benefits and maybe come back home with the money , because it is worth more here			1
’ the @entity31 in @entity10 live in a cluster of clay huts and survive on cabbages , potatoes and corn , which they grow themselves , as well as meagre state benefits			1
from january 1 , all 29million people living in @entity2 and @entity106 will be given the same rights as other @entity109 citizens to live and work in the @entity6			1
restrictions on access to benefits and @entity43 care – imposed when they joined the @entity109 in 2007 – are being lifted			0
staying behind : @entity24 's goat will be left behind in the move @entity2 tv news station @entity116 has suggested that @entity31 in @entity10 and @entity10 , near the @entity118 border , are ‘ just waiting to make the journey to the @entity6 ’			1
some of them have already been ‘ voluntarily expelled ’ from @entity16 – and given free flights home – in a clampdown on illegal camps			0
more than 10,000 @entity31 from @entity2 and @entity106 are repatriated from @entity16 every year			0
@entity24 is one of the wealthiest @entity31 living in @entity10 because , he said , he makes ‘ good money ’ begging on the streets of @entity127 for four months of every year			1
abject poverty : as many as 20 people share a three - bedroom house in @entity10 desperate : @entity131 , 47 , and her one - year - old son @entity25 are supported by @entity24 , who says he makes ' good money ' from begging on the streets of @entity127 for four months every year destitute : children play together in the poverty - stricken village of @entity10 where some properties do not have running water his family including several grandchildren live in a ramshackle brick house , rather than a clay hut , but they are still very poor and hope to relocate to @entity144 soon			1
speaking through a translator , mr @entity24 said : ‘ we have heard on the television that the rules are changing			2
it will be a very good opportunity for us			0
‘ if we can get a house for all the 12 people in my family then it will be a much better way of living			2
‘ my brother - in - law is already working in @entity144 in construction			0
we will wait for a call from him to say it is true that we can get benefits and then we will go the next day			0
i will get a job in construction on the black market , or as an employee			0
’ but it is the world - renowned @entity43 , and not just the housing benefits , that he seeks in @entity6			2
new pastures : families see the move to @entity144 as a ' good opportunity ' for them handouts : the families in the village only receive £ 9 a month from the @entity2 authorities for each of their children , which they say is not enough to raise them his 15 - month - old son @entity25 still bears the scars of heart surgery and mr @entity24 must pay for his on - going medication in @entity2			2
‘ in the @entity6 , it would be better because we would have free medical care , ’ he said			2
another @entity31 villager , @entity186 , 45 , who is not related to @entity24 , also plans to move to the @entity6 when the restrictions are lifted			1
until last summer , she was living illegally in a caravan in @entity127 , and made € 15 a day from begging , but the @entity16 authorities paid for her flight home			2
access to welfare : @entity24 , left , said he hoped to move to @entity6 soon after learning he could be eligible for housing benefits and @entity43 care future : young people are more likely to travel to @entity6 because there is nothing else for them in @entity2 miss @entity131 , who lives in a tiny clay home with her five - year - old daughter @entity200 and 18 relatives , said : ‘ we have heard it will soon be easier for us to go abroad and get the benefits from countries like @entity6			1
‘ we only receive 40 leu ( £ 9 ) per child every month here			0
it is not enough to raise a child			0
’ @entity209 , president of the @entity87 @entity210 , dismissed concerns that @entity2 and @entity106 will claim benefits when the borders rules are relaxed			0
speaking on a video on the @entity216 website , he said : ‘ nobody can come to a country , like @entity16 or @entity221 , and say , “ here i am			0
please , i want social welfare			0
” it ’s stupid , it ’s nonsense			0
