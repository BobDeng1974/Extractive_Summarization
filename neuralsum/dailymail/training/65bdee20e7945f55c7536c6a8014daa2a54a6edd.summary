and asked about the wedding , she said : ‘ i did hear @entity82 , since it ’s not that far from @entity17 - that ’s one of the places they were considering - but apparently @entity82 did n’t win , it 's not going to be the place			1
‘ i do know that @entity18 and @entity20 are planning a trip over to @entity31 in the next week or so to , i guess , scope out some stuff			2

they are good friends , i would think that ’s who he ’d choose			0

' where is she ? !

the @entity184 actor can also show his fiancée some of the local delicacies , such as the famed transparent tarts from @entity188 , or the @entity190 café in @entity16 ’s main street , a favourite hang out with the locals , where his parents dine most weekends			2
a little further down from the luxury property is the @entity48 , a museum dedicated to the star ’s late aunt , the singer most famous for starring in the 1954 film @entity200			0

before the event , @entity27 's sister @entity209 hosted a small garden party for the family reunion at her house where she served up homemade quiches			2
today , she remained tight - lipped when asked about her brother 's wedding - even declining to say whether she had met @entity26			1
but judging by these exclusive photos from the event the brother and sister – born just a year and four days apart – are as closer as ever as the big day approaches , despite her speaking out 18 months ago to say she could n’t see him ever walking down the aisle for a second time following his failed marriage to @entity226 that ended in 1993			0
