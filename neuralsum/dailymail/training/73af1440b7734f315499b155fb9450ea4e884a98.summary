@entity0 believes @entity2 football is shooting itself in the foot by allowing foreign players to dominate the @entity5 at the expense of home - grown talent			1
after another summer in which almost the entire top flight has looked abroad for new signings , @entity8 coach @entity0 believes the decline in players from the @entity14 and @entity15 is an alarming trend			1
the former @entity18 star told @entity19 : ' we are slowly killing ourselves			1
we laugh at @entity21 and the @entity15 but it 's happening to @entity8 before our eyes			2
' all the top six teams did and now there are none			0
there are a few @entity2 players but they 're dwindling fast			0
' that 's not an excuse for the summer and we should have done a lot better but kids are getting blocked and there 's no pathway through for them			0
' looking overseas : @entity64 signed @entity65 from @entity66 this summer , one of many @entity5 buys from foreign leagues impressive : @entity0 urged @entity18 manager @entity69 to play @entity70 this season @entity0 , 39 , believes a 50 - 50 balance between foreign and home - grown players in the @entity5 is about right			1
he also urged new @entity18 manager @entity69 to promote players from the club 's academy rather than importing them from abroad			0
' i 've been encouraged that the manager has played youngsters @entity80 and @entity70 , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity18 fans always crave signings but i 'd rather see @entity70 play than a new signing			0

@entity8 coach says ' we are slowly killing ourselves ' by *favouring* foreign buys ahead of promoting home - produced players
@entity0 was *assistant* to @entity41 as @entity8 *flopped* at @entity42
believes a ' 50 - 50 balance ' between overseas and home - grown players in the @entity5 is the correct approach
