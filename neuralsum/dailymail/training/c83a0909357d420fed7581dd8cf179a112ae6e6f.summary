@entity0 appears to have at long last left our solar system and entered interstellar space … @entity4 has it ? the spacecraft , which carries @entity8 greetings on a gold plated phonograph record , has travelled farther from @entity11 than any other human - made object			1
its current mission , along with @entity16 , is to explore the outermost edge of the sun 's domain and beyond			2
@entity0 's current mission ( illustrated ) along with @entity16 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity27 's domain and beyond and now , @entity29 and @entity30 researchers say it has begun the first exploration of our galaxy beyond the sun 's influence			1
but this contentious claim is at odds with a recent report from @entity23 which claimed @entity0 was still exploring the final frontier of our solar system			1
‘ it 's a somewhat controversial view , but we think @entity0 has finally left the solar system , and is truly beginning its travels through the @entity47 , ' said @entity29 research scientist @entity48			1
mr @entity48 and fellow plasma physicists @entity49 , also of the @entity29 , and @entity50 of @entity30 have constructed a model of the outer edge of the heliosphere			0
this artist 's concept shows @entity23 's two @entity0 spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun in the 36th year after their 1977 launches , the twin @entity0 and 2 spacecraft continue exploring where nothing from @entity11 has flown before			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity72 and @entity73			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity78 and intricacies of @entity73 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity16 went on to explore @entity82 and @entity83 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			0
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity86 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity27 's domain and beyond			0
their model indicates @entity0 actually entered interstellar space a little more than a year ago			1
but @entity23 and other scientists believe the spacecraft is still in a fuzzily - defined transition zone between the @entity27 's sphere of influence and the rest of the galaxy			1
the problem is scientists do not know exactly how far @entity0 has to go to reach interstellar space			2
in reality , there is n’t a clear boundary that defines the limits of our solar system 11 billion miles away			1
the sun ’s pocket , also known as the heliosphere , is relatively well - understood as the region of space dominated by the magnetic field and charged particles emanating from our star			0
outside the heliosphere , interstellar space is filled with matter from other stars and the magnetic field present in the nearby region of the @entity47			2
@entity0 is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward the @entity0 spacecraft explored a new region in our solar system called the magnetic highway			2
in this region , the sun 's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in according to conventional wisdom , scientists will know when @entity0 has passed through this mysterious boundary when they stop seeing solar particles and start seeing galactic particles			1
they will also be a change in the prevailing direction of the local magnetic field			0
the problem is @entity23 believes that the direction of magnetic fields in the solar bubble run in a different directional pattern to the fields found in interstellar space			2
the @entity29 argues that the magnetic fields inside and outside of the solar bubble run in the same direction			0
they claim that because of this , there is an area where the solar bubble and interstellar space overlap , meaning the limits of our solar system are closer and that @entity0 has already crossed it			1
voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments , with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020			0
in a statement @entity23 's voyager project scientist , @entity169 said : ‘ the fine - scale magnetic connection model will become part of the discussion among scientists as they try to reconcile what may be happening on a fine scale with what happens on a larger scale			2
‘ the @entity0 spacecraft is exploring a region no spacecraft has ever been to before			0
we will continue to look for any further developments over the coming months and years as @entity0 explores an uncharted frontier			0
’ @entity0 and @entity16 , which were launched in 1977 , are capable of returning scientific data from a range of instruments and have enough power to remain operational until 2020			0
this artist 's impression shows how plasma flows around @entity23 's @entity0 spacecraft as it gets close to entering interstellar space			1

scientists claim @entity0 entered interstellar space more than a year ago
but @entity23 argues that the spacecraft is still in a fuzzily - defined transition zone between the sun 's sphere of influence and the rest of the galaxy
debate has arisen because our solar system has no clear boundary
