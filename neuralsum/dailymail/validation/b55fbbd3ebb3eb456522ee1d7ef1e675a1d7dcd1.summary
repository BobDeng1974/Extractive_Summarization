damning figures today expose the extent of the ‘ justice deficit ’ for victims of rape			2
only one in four reported rape cases is passed on to prosecutors , who then decide whether to press charges , data shows			1
the figures , published by @entity10 , also reveal worrying differences between forces across @entity13 and @entity14 in how often officers mark down cases as ‘ no crime ’			1
low figures : some areas saw prosecutions in only one in five reported rape cases ( picture posed by model ) in some areas , the number of ‘ no crime ’ cases is as high as one in five , the inspectorate ’s @entity25 found			1
victims ’ groups condemned the ‘ postcode lottery ’ and said that despite police efforts , the experience of victims is not improving			1
@entity38 , of @entity39 , said it revealed an ‘ unacceptable culture of disbelief ’ in some areas			0
he said : ‘ it is extremely concerning that in some parts of @entity13 and @entity14 a rape allegation is four times more likely to be rejected than in others			1
‘ while there can be legitimate reasons to record a rape allegation as " no crime " , these figures suggest an unacceptable culture of disbelief continues to exist in some parts of the police			2
’ @entity58 , of @entity59 , said the data showed ‘ no improvement ’ in victims ’ overall experience of the legal system			0
worried : victim support chief executive @entity38 called the low prosecution figures very ' concerning ' she added : ‘ there ’s still a huge justice deficit for those who experience sexual violence offences compared to those who suffer other kinds of crime			0
’ the figures showed huge discrepancies between forces ’ ‘ no criming ’ rates			0
this is when an offence is initially recorded as rape but then on further consideration it is decided no crime took place			2
victims have complained that ' no criming ' has been used by police as a way of improving their statistics			1
on average , around 9 per cent of adult rape cases were marked down as no crime			2
but in @entity93 that figure was nearly one in five			0
at the other end of the scale it was about 2 per cent for @entity98			0
the 43 forces in @entity13 and @entity14 recorded 20,727 alleged rapes in 2013/14			1
of those , 12,952 involved adult victims and 7,775 children , the @entity10 data shows			0
in the same period , 5,850 were referred to prosecutors – around 28 per cent			1
the slight time delay between a case being reported and sent on to the @entity107 means the figures will not cover exactly the same cases			0
@entity110 , a professor of criminology at @entity112 , said : ‘ today ’s figures provide stark evidence of the inconsistent policing of rape , and the disservice that is being done to those who decide to report to the police			0
’ she said there was ‘ no good reason why such large numbers are not being referred from the police to the cps for consideration ’			2
@entity125 , of the @entity126 , said : ‘ there are caveats to this data			0
' comparing the number of rapes reported to the police with the number of convictions oversimplifies a long and complex process , in which a criminal conviction is not always possible or the desired outcome for victims			1
