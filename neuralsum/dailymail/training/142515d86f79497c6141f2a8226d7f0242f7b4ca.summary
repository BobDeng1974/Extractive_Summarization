a ' remarkable and rare ' @entity1 chariot has been uncovered during an excavation in @entity3			1
archaeologists discovered the bronze chariot fittings , along with horse care tools from 2nd or 3rd @entity7 , at an ancient fort in @entity9			1
experts believe the chariot was either dismantled or never built , and would have belonged to a high - status individual such as a noble or warrior			1
the bronze remains of the 2,200 year old chariot were found at @entity9 , an @entity1 fort near @entity16			1
in this image a chariot linch pin from three angles , showing the intricate decoration at the ends the archaeologists who found the treasures are said to be shell - shocked by the enormity of their discovery			2
the decorated fittings from the 2,200 - year - old @entity1 chariot appear to have been buried as a religious offering			1
researchers also unearthed what are thought to be equestrian tools , including an object that was probably a grooming comb and two curved blades which may have been used in the care of horse hooves			2
the discovery was made by students from the @entity39 during their ongoing excavation of the @entity41 , near @entity16 in @entity3			2
parts of the chariot are decorative with @entity45 - style designs			2
in this image are a selection of chariot fittings including a miniature terret ring ( a metal hoop for a horse harness ) on the upper left , a large terret ring ( upper right ) , strap junction ( lower left ) and barrel - shaped harness fitting around 2,000 years ago , @entity3 's settlements were built on top of hills rather on on the lowland plains as they are today			1
archaeological excavations have found that @entity3 ’s @entity9 , @entity63 and @entity64 were once all ancient hilltop settlements , known as hillforts			2
from the fifth century @entity7 and throughout the @entity1 , hillforts flourished throughout central and western @entity67			1
the three examples in @entity3 are some of the best - preserved hillforts in the @entity70 , and tremendous feats of engineering for their time			0
@entity9 , where the chariot was uncovered , is about five miles south of @entity16 , and is @entity3 ’s largest hillfort			1
it may have once been the ancient capital of the @entity79 ’ native tribe , the @entity80 and a key economic centre			0
from , @entity9 ancient @entity1 warriors would have been able to see other important sites , such as @entity84			1
there is also evidence the area has been occupied by humans since the early @entity89 , around 4,000 years ago			0
while digging a large , deep pit near the remains of a house within the hillfort , four students found a piece of bronze in the ground , before uncovering more parts nearby			2
taken together , the pieces are recognisable as a matching set of bronze fittings from a mid to late @entity1 chariot			1
after cleaning , decorative patterns could be seen in the metalwork , including a triskele motif showing three waving lines which is similar to the flag of the @entity108			0
the parts include chariot linch pins and other fittings , including rings , straps and what was described as a barrel - shaped harness fitting			2
' realising that i was actually uncovering a hoard that was carefully placed there hundreds of years ago made it the find of a lifetime , ' she @entity122 , who was among the students who made the discovery			0
the pieces appear to have been gathered in a box before being planted in the ground on top of a layer of cereal vase and burnt as part of a religious ritual			0
the case might have doubled as a ' cushion ' for the box and also the fuel for the fire			0
after the burning , the entire deposit was covered by a layer of burnt cinder and slag , where it lay undisturbed for more than 2,200 years until the team uncovered it			0
pictured is a iron ‘ curry comb ’			0
researchers believe it may have been used to maintain horses hooves or manufacture harness parts			0
the archaeologists who found the treasures are said to be shell - shocked by the enormity of their discovery the discovery was made by students from the @entity39 during their ongoing excavation of the @entity41 ( pictured ) , near @entity16 in @entity3			1
the archaeologists believe the chariot would have belonged to a high - status individual and the burial may have taken place to mark a new season			1
dr @entity167 , who lectures in landscape archaeology at the university , said : ' this is a matching set of highly decorated bronze fittings from an @entity1 chariot - probably from the 2nd or 3rd century @entity173 ' this is the most remarkable discovery of material we made at @entity9 in the five years we worked on the site			1
this is a very rare discovery , and a strong sign of the prestige of the site			0
' the atmosphere at the dig on the day was a mix of " tremendously excited " and " slightly shell - shocked " , ' he said			0
' i have been excavating for 25 years and i have never found one of these pieces - let alone a whole set			2
it is a once - in - a - career discovery			0
' while digging a large , deep pit near the remains of a house within the hillfort , four students found a piece of bronze in the ground , before uncovering more parts @entity201 together , the pieces are recognisable as a matching set of bronze fittings from a mid to @entity1 chariot the discovery was made at an ancient fort in @entity9 , @entity3			1
@entity9 , where the chariot was uncovered and is @entity3 ’s largest hillfort the co-director of the project , @entity212 , said iron tools were placed around the box before it was then burnt , and covered in a thick layer of cinder and slag			1
' the function of the iron tools is a bit of a mystery , but given the equestrian nature of the hoard , it is possible that they were associated with horse grooming			1
' one piece in particular has characteristics of a modern curry comb , while two curved blades may have been used to maintain horses hooves or manufacture harness parts			0
' the parts have been taken to the @entity39 's @entity234 for further analysis			0
the archaeologists hope they will be put on public display in due course			0
before then , they will be on temporary display at the @entity240 , @entity16 , @entity3 , from october 18 to december 13			0
the @entity39 has been excavating at @entity9 since 2010			1
the parts have been taken to the @entity39 's @entity234 and @entity242 for further analysis			0

@entity39 uncovered the chariot fittings with horse care tools
they date to the 2nd or 3rd @entity7 and were found in @entity9
experts believe the @entity1 chariot was either dismantled or never built
it may have belonged to high - status individual such as a noble or warrior
however , the function of the iron tools close to chariot remains a mystery
