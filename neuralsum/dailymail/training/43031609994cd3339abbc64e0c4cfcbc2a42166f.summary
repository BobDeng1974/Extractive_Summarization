@entity0 came face - to - face with his image problems yesterday – as he was presented with cartoons portraying him as @entity4 from the children ’s animation films			1
the @entity8 leader dismissed suggestions that he has become a figure of fun in the eyes of voters			1
but as he laughed off comparisons with the film character on @entity19 ’s @entity18 show , it emerged that he is worried enough about his poor public image to have sought help from a world renowned expert on autism			1
mr @entity0 has also employed a voice coach			1
it was autism expert @entity27 who apparently advised the @entity8 leader to make a virtue of his political ‘ empathy ’ – a word he used seven times in a speech last friday			1
he said he has had several conversations with mr @entity0 over the past year			1
@entity59 was about ‘ being a good listener ’ and being able to take in to account ‘ different perspectives ’			0
mr @entity27 was given an advance copy of friday ’s speech			0
‘ his office contacted me this time last summer			0
they asked me if i ’d meet him because @entity0 had read my book			2
he invited me to talk to him about the politics of empathy , ’ he told @entity64			2
‘ i talked to him about the relevance of empathy to a party leader and potential future prime minister			2
he has invited me to various events over the past year			0
he ’s now starting to use the word empathy			0
' it may be that he ’s trying to position himself as a different kind of leader			2
it ’s about being a good listener and taking into account diverse perspectives			0
’ mr @entity0 has hired professional voice coach @entity86 to improve how he speaks , the @entity85 reported			2
mr @entity86 , a theatre producer , claims to ‘ unblock ’ his clients and ‘ harness their physical leadership ’			0
members of the public should be brought into the @entity92 to grill the prime minister once a week , @entity0 said yesterday			2
he said he wanted to reinvigorate @entity95 politics by allowing ordinary voters to have their own version of prime minister ’s questions , or @entity99			0
mr @entity0 , who will put the idea to commons speaker @entity101 , said it would ‘ let the public into our politics ’			1
but critics claimed the sessions would undermine @entity95 ’s representative democracy , in which mps reflect their constituents ’ concerns			0
@entity112 said it would consider the idea , but raised doubts about how voters in @entity116 , @entity117 or @entity118 would be able to take part			0
he is the second theatre figure linked to the @entity121 in recent months			0
earlier this year it was reported that @entity124 theatre boss @entity123 has helped him with voice projection and posture			0
yesterday , questioned on his image , mr @entity0 laughed at the @entity4 - inspired cartoons of himself when @entity18 produced copies on air			1
mr @entity18 said there was an ' @entity0 problem ' at the top of the @entity8 which was putting off voters			1
' you have got very poor leadership ratings at the moment			0
and you enemies are trying to dig into people 's heads an image of you which is then very , very hard to remove			2
' at this point he produced newspaper cartoons of mr @entity0 portrayed as @entity4 in various scenarios			1
' you are going to show it to me ? brilliant , ' mr @entity0 said , nervously			2
mr @entity149 continued : ' that 's one of you on fire ... you have clearly bitten someone there ... ' mr @entity0 sought to laugh it off , telling the presenter : ' i did n't realise you were going to bring me present , that 's incredibly kind			1
i will show it to my kids			0
' mr @entity0 joked that he was going to give the cartoons to his sons , as he again insisted he did not think image was important mr @entity0 tried to laugh off the ' gifts ' but has admitted that voters have come to view him like the plasticine character @entity8 hope to turn the personal attacks on mr @entity0 into an advantage , believing voters are fed up with spin and pr being considered more important than policies			1
this week a string of senior frontbenchers will being a series of speeches on what @entity8 would do if mr @entity0 becomes prime minister next year			1
but the high - risk strategy has only succeeded in turning the spotlight back on mr @entity0 's woeful personal approval ratings			1
' mr @entity0 said : ' i want to find ways to change our political culture			2
' i have had lots of people saying to me over three or four years i have been leader " why do n't you do more things like @entity188 " - things like the photo with the huskies that he did in the @entity191 , the wind turbine on the roof , things like that			1
' what i have worked out is personally , i do n't care about it that much			0
of course communications is an important part of modern politics , i 'm not pretending it is n't			2
' but i do n't care ... it is not the most important thing			0
' mr @entity18 , a former newspaper editor and @entity206 political editor , told mr @entity0 repeatedly that image ' does matter ' in 21st century politics @entity8 hope to portray mr @entity0 as someone who is more focused on changing the country than how he looks on camera but in an extraordinary riposte , mr @entity18 , a former @entity19 political editor and editor of @entity214 , said he was wrong			1
mr @entity18 told him : ' you may hate it , you may think it is trivial , you may think it is awful , but it 's how things are done now			1
' just as how in the @entity223 period you had to stand up and make a three - hour speech in front of 300 people , now you have to do photo opportunities and deal with the internet and memes and so forth			1
' therefore it is the job , it is the duty of a political leader to be better at it that you have been			0
' it is not enough to say " it does n't matter "			1
it 's the way things are done			0
' mr @entity0 insisted he would ' keep trying ' , adding : ' what i was saying was not photos do n't matter or i am never doing to take photos			1
' it is more what do we really value most			0
what is really going to change things for people			0

@entity8 leader has taken on his critics to insist he is not interested in image
he insists there is more to politics than photo opportunities and spin
but @entity18 told him : ' it is not enough to say " it does n't matter " '
during tv interview , he handed over cartoons mocking @entity0 's looks
