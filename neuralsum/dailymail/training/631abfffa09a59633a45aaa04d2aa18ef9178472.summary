foreign airports can be scary and confusing places with any number of dangers just waiting to trip you up - especially if the warning signs are all in @entity6			2
so to keep safe , just remember to avoid ' landslides ' in the lounge , the ' flesh juice ' in the canteen and the ' mind crotch ' on the stairs ... and whatever you do , never ' bomb into the ash ' in the smoking area			1
but if you ever do fall foul of any of these hidden perils , remember ... you can always pull the ' @entity19 '			1
these are just some of the bizarre - and befuddling - translations of everyday signage pictured in airports across the @entity24			0
and they make for a rather baffling read			0
visitors to airports across @entity29 captured some of the more amusing translations , posting their pictures of signs and labels on an online blog			1
in an airport ? : what appears to be a ' careful : @entity42 surface ' sign has been labelled ' be careful of landslide ' in this @entity6 bathroom appetising : a sign in @entity46 advertises fresh fruit juice is translated as a rather less appetising ' flesh juice ' befuddling : if you do n't know what a mind crotch is , then it is best to avoid this @entity6 airport , while smokers in @entity56 should never ' bomb into the ash here ' , right unnerving : if you ever do fall foul of any of these hidden perils , remember ... you can always pull the ' @entity19 ' at @entity62 in @entity63 found on everything from poorly translated signs and menus to bizarrely worded adverts and strange t - shirt slogans the mis - use of @entity70 can be found everywhere			1
scroll down to see the latest collection of amusingly ' creative ' @entity70 from around the world			0
the results include simple translations that have been worded perhaps more bluntly than @entity76 travellers might be used to - such as a row of seats reserved for the ' old , weak and pregnant '			1
passengers at one airport were informed that their flight had been ' delayed for some reasons '			1
helpful : a series of photographs posted on an online blog details bizarre and hilarious @entity70 translations in airports across @entity29 communication breakdown : a toilet has been reserved for the ' weal only ' ( left ) while a metal bin before airport security has been designated as a ' liquid abandoned place ' nappy swap : travellers are informed of an unusual in - flight service , a ' baby diaper exchange ' @entity98 : a row of seats in one @entity6 airport has been reserved for the ' old , weak and pregnant ' , right , while a bin has usefully been designated for ' unrecycling ' waste the vernacular mismatch also leads to a bin labelled for ' unrecycling ' and a useful sign telling people to ' mind crotch '			1
since being posted online , the signs gone viral as internet - users share them with friends and send in other wacky suggestions they 've found themselves on their travels			2
other translations have been confused as much for cultural as linguistic reasons , evidenced by what appears to be ' careful : slippery surface ' sign , labelled ' be careful of landslide '			2
there is also a charity donation box asking travellers to donate cash to help ' especially difficult children '			2
it is almost full to the brim			0
muddle : even the most considerate of travellers might find it difficult to understand this message romance : for sanitation purposes you should only share your can with a lover full : it might prove a rather difficult task to squeeze any more money into this box for ' especially difficult children ' meanwhile a @entity46 sign asks parents , not , apparently , to throw away their child 's dirty nappies , but to take them to the ' baby diaper exchange '			0
some are so confusing that it is impossible to even guess what the sign is asking frequent fliers to do , such as a sign above the door of a @entity6 aeroplane that asks passengers to ' gets hold of arm rest to fall the wound carefully '			0
there is even a @entity6 vending machine that urges thirsty travellers not to share their cans of drink with anyone - unless they are ' not the lovers '			0
mannerly : visitors are welcomed by a sign telling them they are entering a ' civilized airport ' parent and child : users of an escalator are told to look after their ' oldster ' as well as child honest mistake : a simple misspelling labels a ' fire fydrant '			0
