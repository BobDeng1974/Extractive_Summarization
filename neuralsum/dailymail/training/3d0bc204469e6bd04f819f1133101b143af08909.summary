by @entity0 a gargantuan asteroid which struck @entity2 more than 300million years ago changed the face of the @entity4 forever , a new study claims			1
the six - mile diameter asteroid left an impact zone more than 120 miles wide - the third largest such site on the planet - and likely led to mass extinctions worldwide			1
' the dust and greenhouse gases released from the crater , the seismic shock and the initial fireball would have incinerated large parts of the @entity4 , ' said @entity17 , visiting fellow at the @entity19			1
gargantuan : researchers have discovered the impact site of a six - mile wide asteroid which struck @entity2 some 300million years ago and likely led to mass extinctions across the planet he added : ' the greenhouse gases would stay in the atmosphere for tens of thousands of years			1
' evidence of the ancient catastrophe was only discovered after another researcher alerted dr @entity17 to unusual mineral deposits in the @entity32 in @entity2			0
as the ages have passed , the mammoth impact zone has been buried beneath nearly 2.5 miles of earth			1
to identify it dr @entity17 and his colleagues analysed quartz grains drawn from the site and studied underground seismic and magnetic anomalies			2
the strike may have been part of an asteroid impact cluster which caused an era of mass extinction , wiping out primitive coral reefs and other species , added dr @entity17			1
however , he added , the impact happened well before the time of the dinosaurs			2
known extent of the @entity32 based on the @entity52 ¿ seismic horizon : the @entity54 divides the eastern @entity32 , which underlies the @entity55 , from the @entity56 ' it ’s significant because it 's so large			2
it 's the third largest impact terrain anywhere on @entity4 found to date , ' he told @entity63 science news site @entity64			1
' it ’s likely to be part of a particular cluster that was linked with a mass extinction event at that time			0
' he said there was a chance that the incoming asteroid actually split in two as it made its fiery descent through the @entity4 's atmosphere			2
' we are studying another anomaly in @entity77 that could well be its twin but we do n’t know yet , ' he said			0
dr @entity79 , research astronomer at the @entity80 , told @entity64 that the find offered fresh evidence of the links between asteroid impacts and mass extinctions			0
' @entity2 is a fantastic place for impact crater hunters because we have huge open space with nothing in it , ' said dr @entity79 , who was not involved in the research			0
' it 's huge , ' he added			0
' most asteroid impacts are about 100m in diameter			0
' dr @entity17 is co-author of a study detailing the findings published in the journal @entity99 this month .			0

six - mile wide rock hit 300million years ago and left 120 mile impact zone
it is the third largest asteroid impact site on the planet
seismic shock and fireball would have ' incinerated large parts of @entity4 '
