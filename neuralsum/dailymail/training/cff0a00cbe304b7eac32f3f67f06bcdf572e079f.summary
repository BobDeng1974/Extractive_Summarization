the 37 - year - old architect , who is believed to have got out of the blue vehicle before it caught fire , was remanded in custody at @entity22			1
the @entity13 , reportedly driven by @entity8 , burst into flames after slamming into the house in @entity25 , @entity22 at the time of the 7am incident , @entity8 ’s estranged wife @entity26 , 27 , and three children believed to be two boys and a girl aged between two and six were inside the £ 100,000 house and were woken by the impact of the crash			1
police and firefighters arrived at the scene in @entity25 , near @entity22 , @entity38 to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flames			1
although four people were believed to have been inside the house when the incident took place , the family managed to escape unhurt @entity8 was remanded in custody and is due to appear at @entity49 in august 10 in relation to the incident @entity51 said @entity8 was arrested near to the scene of the crash			1
the 37 - year - old had previously fought for better road safety on the street after his daughter @entity57 was knocked down by a car two years ago			1
as a result , mobile speed checks were carried out on the busy road last year			2
in an interview with his local paper @entity8 said : ' i get really emotional when i talk about what happened to @entity57 , and i am just so glad she is still here			2
' @entity8 's wife and family were taken in by a neighbour whilst firefighters tackled the blaze at their home police are now investigating whether the car was driven at the house deliberately and then set on fire afterwards - or whether the vehicle caught fire as a result of the impact			1
an officer stood guard at the house which had been damaged by the fire			2
the remains of the front wall were piled up in front of the lounge window which had been shattered by the force of the impact			1
one neighbour said : ' it was about 7am when i heard a loud bang and i went out to see what happened from my front door			0
i could see the car had collided with the wall and there was smoke and flames everywhere			0
scene of investigation : the car was driven into the family home and exploded - no - one inside the property was hurt ' the next thing we knew was there were police everywhere and a police helicopter flying around			2
if one of those kiddies had been in the front room we could have been looking at a fatality			0
' another neighbour said : ' there was a large bang and i came out and saw flames coming out of the front window			0
quite a few people came out too			0
' i only moved here in november last year and knew that a woman lived there with three kids and partner			0
they must have only recently split up because i thought i ’d seen them together			0
' i ’d never heard anything untowards coming from the house or an shouting or disturbances			0
the children are all very small , i think two are at a nursery and one at primary school			0
' wrecked : police and firefighters arrived at the scene in @entity25 , near @entity22 , @entity38 to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame a police spokesman said : ' shortly after 7.05am on tuesday 24 july 2012 , police were called to @entity146 in @entity25 following a report that a car had collided with the front of a house			1
' police officers and firefighters attended and found that a @entity13 had collided with the house and was on fire			0
' three children and a woman were inside the house at the time of the incident but were not injured			2
a joint investigation is being carried out by police and @entity162 to look into the circumstances surrounding the fire			0
' ' a 37 - year - old man ( was ) taken into police custody for questioning			1
' roads were closed temporarily whilst forensic officers examined the scene			0
the incident occurred after @entity8 who runs his own design and architect practice campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter @entity57 - then aged two years old - was knocked down by a car outside their home in september 2010			1
crime scene : an officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire she survived the impact and made a full recovery but mr @entity8 collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £ 500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area			1
speaking to his local paper , mr @entity8 also said : ' i want to thank everyone who is supporting me			2
the roads will be a lot safer if people are reminded about the 30mph speed limit and how to spot it			0
' on roads that have a lot of pedestrians and houses on each side , children can just run out into the road like my daughter did			2
' if the driver is doing more than 30 mph , it can be difficult for them to stop and there can be a serious accident			0
' @entity8 set up @entity215 and @entity216 pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages instead about his work designing loft and garage conversions			1
