while not everything that glitters is gold , the sparkling new polish from celebrity manicurist @entity0 most certainly is			1
the celebrity nail maestro has created a dazzling new varnish , appropriately named @entity6 , using flecks of real 24 - carat gold			2
and with famous fans that include @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , the luxury lacquer has already secured the a-list seal of approval as well as an a-list price tag			1
celebrity favourite : @entity0 , who paints the nails of @entity11 , left , and @entity21 , right , has created a dazzling new varnish , appropriately named @entity6 , using flecks of real 24 - carat gold the polish , which aims to create a textured manicure , will go on sale for £ 50 at @entity26 later this month			1
as well as gold flecks the varnish is packed with green tea extract and biotin and was used by @entity0 herself backstage at the @entity32 show at @entity33 last month			2
and this is n't the only @entity0 polish to contain an unexpectedly expensive ingredient : also available are polishes that contain powdered diamonds and crushed pearls			2
as a result , the brand has become a regular on the fashion circuit with @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 among those to enlist @entity0 for their shows			0
that 's one expensive top coat ! the £ 50 polish aims to create a chunky gold manicure the manicurist has also created bespoke looks for some of the biggest celebrity names in the business			0
most famously , @entity0 did the nails of @entity60 on the night she took home an @entity62 for her part in @entity65 biopic walk the line in 2005			0
@entity0 has also teamed up with some of her celebrity clients to produce bespoke shades that are available for the rest of us to buy			0
among the a-list approved hues are @entity73 , a bright orange - coral created with the help of model @entity76 , and the glamorous deep red @entity78 , which was originally made for @entity79 , @entity80 for @entity14 , and @entity81			0
and @entity0 is n't the only beauty buff with a taste for lucrative polish			0
shoe designer @entity85 , whose clients include @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity21 , recently launched his debut nail range complete with 31 varnishes inspired by his famous shoes			1
the reason the soles of all @entity85 shoes are red is because he ' felt as though something was missing ' when he saw his first prototype shoe and decided to paint the bottom with his assistant 's red nail varnish			2
so it was only a matter of time before he unveiled a range of lacquers			0
the range of polishes will set you back £ 36 a bottle ... but at least that 's a fraction of the price of his £ 600 shoes			1
is that practical ? shoe designer @entity85 , left , recently launched his debut nail range complete with 31 nail varnishes inspired by his famous shoes			1
