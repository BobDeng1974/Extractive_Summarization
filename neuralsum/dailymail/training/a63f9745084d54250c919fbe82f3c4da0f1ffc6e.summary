by @entity1 reporter published : 09:24 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 7 august 2013 a nature - lover has completed a barking challenge of travelling across @entity4 to climb a different tree every day for a year			1
@entity6 , 36 , clambered up the branches of 365 trees on his journey through 10 countries			1
he scaled trees almost 100ft ( 30metres ) high during and spent between 10 and 90 minutes a day climbing			1
@entity13 : @entity6 causes a bit of a stir as he climbs a tree in @entity17 , @entity18 , during his year long challenge nice view : @entity6 climbed a tree every day for a year as he travelled around 10 countries mr @entity6 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , loved climbing trees as a child and said he wanted to experience the thrill of the adventure again			1
he left the @entity28 and took a tree - climbing road trip across @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity18 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
he also interviewed 80 people in the boughs of various pine , ash , oak , beech , silver birch and poplar trees to keep his mission interesting			2
one of his most notable conquests was ascending a @entity38 spruce , which later was used for @entity52 's @entity51			2
he also climbed a tree in @entity38 on @entity54 dressed as @entity55 in minus 23 degrees temperature			1
mr @entity6 said : ' climbing a different tree every day for a year was a personal challenge			1
' at first , i took a short part of the day out to find a tree and climb it , fitting it in around my everyday life			2
challenge : @entity6 said he wanted to raise awareness about ' sustainability and staying in touch with nature ' festive : nature lover climbed this @entity38 spruce which then became @entity71 's @entity70 do n't look down : @entity6 climbed trees almost 100ft high during his travels ' but as the project went on it took up more and more of my time and took over			1
' i soon realised it was going to get boring if it was just me , so i started to invite other people to join me and interviewed them up trees			0
' mr @entity6 said he got the acorn for the unusual endeavour at a friend 's party			2
he said : ' everyone was playing a game , messing around putting a pirate hat up a tree			0
' i ended up joining in and it reminded me how much i enjoyed climbing trees as a kid			0
' an idea came to me of holding an acorn in my hand and saying ' i am going to climb this tree			0
' it 's a sign of hope that the tree will grow and be big enough for me to climb , and that i 'll still be around to do it			0
' @entity6 went travelling with six friends , regularly making them pull over so he could climb his next tree			1
he said : ' a good tree needs enough branches , to pose a bit of a challenge , but also manageable so you feel comfortable			2
' if you have to stretch too much and extend yourself , it 's no fun			0
once you 're in the tree , there needs to be space to move around in			0
communal : six friends joined @entity6 and he interviewed people up in the branches so he did not get bored dangerous : @entity6 , pictured up a @entity38 spruce , had a ' no falling and no dying ' rule ' the friends i was with were very patient - they were always having to wait for me at the bottom of a tree			1
' i was adamant i had to climb a tree every 24 hours , and often we 'd be driving for hours and hours , then have to stop for me to get a climb in before midnight			0
' i 'd get as high up in the tree as i could but had to be fairly careful - i also had a " no falling and dying " rule to stick to			2
mr @entity6 said there was a serious point to the fun			2
he said : ' i 'm passionate about sustainability and staying in touch with nature			1
' people were usually keen and excited when i told them about the project , and a bit curious about why i was doing it			0
' when it was over , it felt very strange			0
you 'd think i 'd feel relieved but i had become so used to looking for the next tree it was odd not to anymore			0
' in @entity145 , he encouraged 44 people to join him in a tree - ranging from an eight - month pregnant woman , children to climbers aged in their fifties			2
not afraid of heights ? the climber took this picture from his vantage point at the top of a pine tree in @entity18 leafy : @entity6 's view from the top of a @entity161 in his home town of @entity22 , @entity28 mr @entity6 interviewed a belly dancer , a class of schoolchildren , a @entity167 's family and an economist in trees			1
he also climbed a tree drunk , got his hair cut in a tree and disturbed a young couple kissing under a tree so he could climb it			0
his family - some of whom had not seen him since he was a baby - joined him up his last tree , in @entity38 , for a ' family tree ' party			1
mr @entity6 , whose father is @entity38 , said : ' i loved the family tree , that might be my favourite			1
' i 'm sure some of my relatives were just humouring me , but they showed up			0
' one of his earliest memories is from the age of three , when his brother made him climb a tree in the @entity192 , @entity23 , in a game			0
he is writing a book , ' uptrees ' , about his adventure .			0
