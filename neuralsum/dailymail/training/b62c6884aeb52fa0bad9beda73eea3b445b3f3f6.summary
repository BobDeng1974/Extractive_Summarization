by @entity0 warfare may be an awful thing , but it has a habit of accelerating health technology in ways that are helpful to everyone			2
for example , in @entity8 the @entity7 made significant medical advances in vital areas such as developing antibiotic drugs — which the @entity13 did n’t possess — and performing lifesaving blood transfusions			2
now , however , the military is developing an alarming new interest in the human body and brain			2
it wants to create armies of mutant soldiers , equipped with unstoppable physical and mental powers			1
within 30 years , according to newly released @entity26 papers , @entity24 soldiers should be able to lift huge weights , run at high speeds over extreme distances , have infra - red night vision built into their brains , and even be capable of transmitting thoughts by electronically aided telepathy			1
and this is not just pie - in - the - sky planning			1
science is now emerging that may make these army dreams real			2
a recent @entity40 request revealed details of a two - day future - gazing summit by the @entity26 ’s obscure development concepts and @entity44 , where military spooks swapped ideas with experts from universities , industry and government			1
the summit concluded that by 2045 , advances in medical technology could create a class of genetically superior humans — rather like the super-powered science fiction characters @entity57 , storm and @entity59 from @entity60			2
further details of the military boffins ’ thinking are on the internet , in an @entity26 report titled : global strategic trends out to 2040			1
this predicts that advanced drug and genetic technologies will enable armies to reprogram soldiers ’ genes , in order to transform them into daunting fighters			1
high - tech implants in brains could also help to turn square - bashing squaddies into super-intelligent man - machines			1
the defence ministry forecasters have given the process a chilling clinical name : ‘ human augmentation ’			1
they predict that these brain implants ( called ‘ cognitive prostheses ’ ) could give solders bionic vision and hearing , as well as towering iqs and total recall			1
the @entity26 report adds that such ‘ augmented ’ soldiers could even have bodies that self - repair wounds , through the use of what it terms ‘ regenerative medicine , tissue engineering and artificial immune systems ’			1
it all sounds far too fantastic to be real			2
but , in fact , some of these outlandish predictions are already turning out to be true			2
arms race : in the future a @entity24 , currently limited in the amount of equipment he can physically carry , could be given superstrength			2
( @entity108 picture ) for example , @entity112 ’s @entity111 company is developing an advanced robotic exoskeleton known as the @entity115 , which will enable men to carry massive loads with minimal effort , either on their front or their back			0
the skeleton is ultralight , highly mobile and attached to the outside of the body with its own titanium legs , which transfer the weight of any load to the ground			0
microcomputers sense the soldier ’s body movements and enable it to do exactly what he does , whether it is running , lifting or even crawling			0
prototype versions are already entering combat trials in @entity135			0
meanwhile , super-vision came considerably closer last year after pioneering surgery at the @entity138 in @entity139 restored some sight to @entity141 , a paralympic swimming champion in his 60s who had been blind for 17 years			0
the key to the operation ’s success was a 3mm microchip with 1,500 light - sensitive cells implanted into each retina and connected by wire to a power unit implanted behind his ear			1
when light enters the eye and hits the chips , it stimulates light - sensitive cells which send signals to the brain , enabling him to see			1
military experts see huge potential			0
experiments in the @entity112 have shown that implant technology could also give normally sighted soldiers amazing extra senses , such as night vision , and even the ability to see magnetic fields			1
science fiction : what seems like science fiction today could soon become a battlefield reality if technology being worked on by @entity26 boffins sees the light of day			1
( @entity108 picture ) the breakthrough has been made by dr @entity181 , a neurobiologist at @entity182 in @entity183 , who announced earlier this year that he had given rats the ability to detect infra - red light , normally invisible to them , by fitting them with an infra - red detector wired to microscopic electrodes in their brains			1
the military are interested in super-blood , too			0
surgeons and emergency doctors have long hoped for the advent of artificial blood that can safely be stored for months or years , and be given to any patient			0
now that possibility is nearing reality , thanks to the work of @entity24 teams such as those at the @entity203			0
chemists there have created a ‘ plastic blood ’ that mimics red blood cells and can be successfully donated to over 98 per cent of patients			1
military scientists are predicting a wealth of potential breakthroughs in human capability that could be created by advanced future versions of artificial blood			0
for example , nanotechnology could fill them with synthetic platelets , the naturally occurring cell fragments vital for clotting , enabling wounds to heal faster			1
artificial blood could also be adapted to increase its power to carry oxygen and nutrients round the body , thus boosting muscle and brain power			0
but artificial blood would not be the only way to muscle power			0
back in 2004 , @entity233 , a geneticist at the @entity234 , showed it was possible to create genetically modified mice that produced a natural stimulant in their muscles called ‘ insulin - like growth factor ’			1
some of the finest minds are working away on military technology which could transform the @entity24 soldier into bionic superhumans , according to newly released documents mice with such enhanced genes had more than 30 per cent stronger muscles , enabling them to run for much faster and longer than normal			0
dr @entity233 ’s mice were modified as embryos			0
since then , genetics researchers have been working on ways to boost muscles in adults			0
in 2008 , scientists at the @entity234 created @entity257 mice that could run six times further than normal without suffering from exhaustion , by altering a gene called interleukin - @entity262 alpha , which shifts how energy is used in the ‘ fast - twitch ’ muscle fibres that provide sprinting ability			1
such breakthroughs promise to create armies that appear unbeatable			0
the @entity269 is now working on manipulating human brainwaves to optimise performance			0
@entity112 military chiefs are seeking a technology system that would synchronise gamma waves ( which facilitate memory creation ) and theta waves ( for turning short - term memories into lasting ones ) , so they work together in the best way			2
this would boost the ability of soldiers to retain lots of information in high - stress situations , for longer			1
telepathy is being considered as well — and already a machine has been developed in dr @entity181 ’s laboratory to make it happen , facilitating telepathic communication over distances of thousands of miles , though so far only for rats			0
the implications for the military are extraordinary			0
if commanders could simply pass on their thoughts to their troops without the need for radios , it would confer a huge tactical advantage			0
given the extraordinary pace of technological development , one thing is certain — the toughest man in the @entity308 could soon be the one with a silicon chip on his shoulder .			2
