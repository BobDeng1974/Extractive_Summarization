by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 10 december 2012 when archaeologists unearthed the well - preserved tomb of a second - century @entity6 general that had lain under muddy clay for 1800 years , their find was hailed as the most important ancient @entity6 monument to come to light for decades			2
the burial place of @entity12 , the general who advised emperor @entity13 and fought germanic tribes in the second century , was found at @entity15 , north of @entity16 , in 2008 , and boasted marble pillars and @entity19 inscriptions			1
but despite the joy of historians who pored over the important ancient mausoleum , @entity21 authorities say it may now have to be reburied as they can not afford the preservation works necessary to keep it open			2
beautifully preserved : the tomb of @entity12 lay under thick clay for nearly 2000 years before being excavated in 2008 austerity measures mean cash for maintaining @entity21 's archaeological sites has been cut by 20 per cent since 2010 , which means that unless a sponsor comes forward soon with the € 2 - 3m ( £ 1.6m - £ 2.4m ) needed to preserve the ancient tomb , it will have to be be covered up			1
' it is a painful choice but we can not risk losing the monument , ' @entity37 , @entity16 's archaeological superintendent , told the daily @entity41			2
' the marbles ca n't face another winter [ so ] we must bury the site in order to preserve it			1
' unlike @entity46 's character @entity47 , @entity12 died a rich man after a long and successful career , and his extravagant tomb bears testament to that			1
with marble roof tiles , a panel carved with @entity19 script detailing his military career , which included a visit to @entity57 , and perfectly preserved carvings and friezes , the monument has lain under the thick clay of the nearby river @entity63 , which has helped it stay in such good condition			1
since it has been opened up , however , cracks have appeared in the stonework and the delicate letterwork has been discoloured by air pollution			2
' the general who became a slave			2
the slave who became a gladiator			0
the gladiator who defied an emperor ' : @entity46 in the 2000 film , @entity78 @entity79 , an @entity80 archaeologist who is campaigning to keep the monument open , said : ' this is an extraordinary site , it blows you away			0
' burying these remains is a disaster - you wonder what is the point of archaeology			0
' @entity89 , of the heritage group @entity90 , told @entity91 that cuts were threatening the condition of many historical sites including @entity95 and @entity96 , @entity98 ' palace on @entity99			0
she said : ' over 40 per cent of @entity21 's archaeological sites are now closed due to lack of funds			0
inspectors often can not even get to the more remote sites in their cars because the ministry wo n't give them petrol and there is less money for guards to keep looters out			0
' @entity112 ' tomb , which lies close to the ancient @entity113 which linked @entity16 to the @entity114 on the east coast , was attacked by looters shortly after it was uncovered in 2008			1
however the thieves were unable to carry the heavy piece of marble they wanted , and had to dump it nearby			0
as winter approaches , the filling - in work may begin any day soon			1
@entity123 , the archaeologist who led the dig , said : ' there are more mausoleums waiting to be revealed along this stretch of the @entity113			0
it 's a gold mine we may never get to see			0
' @entity12 was born in @entity130 , northern @entity21 born to a distinguished local family , @entity12 became a senator at around 25 and a consul 16 years later in around @entity134 @entity12 was a general and consul who led campaigns for @entity13 from 161ad to @entity137 he fought numerous battles against adversaries including the @entity141 and @entity142 tribes who invaded @entity21 he became one of the @entity146 's favourites and part of his inner circle , serving as proconsul in @entity150			1

burial place of @entity12 was found near @entity63 in 2008
it will be filled in unless £ *2m* can be found to *protect* it from winter *weather*
