a group of @entity2 pastors stunned @entity3 on tuesday by calling for the impeachment and removal of @entity6 , the black lawyer who heads the @entity8 @entity7			1
attorney general holder , a longtime friend and ally of president @entity11 , spoke tuesday at the winter meeting of the @entity13 , telling top law enforcers at the state level that laws banning gay marriage can be cast aside if they believe they encourage illegal discrimination			1
' in general , ' @entity6 told them , ' i believe that we must be suspicious of legal classifications based solely on sexual orientation			2
' ' and we must endeavor in all of our efforts to uphold and advance the values that once led our forebears to declare unequivocally that all are created equal and entitled to equal opportunity			0
the result of his latest remarks is a new federal government - sanctioned license , covering attorneys general who refuse to defend ' traditional marriage ' laws when they are challenged in court			1
that has angered the @entity34 , which said it aims to collect 1 million signatures on an impeachment petition that blames @entity6 for violating his oath of office by picking and choosing which laws to enforce on the basis of his personal beliefs			1
' president @entity11 and attorney general @entity6 have turned their backs on the values the @entity2 people hold dear , ' the group said , ' values particularly cherished in the black community : values like marriage , which should be strengthened and promoted , rather than weakened and undermined			1
addressing @entity6 's move to bring state attorneys general along , the group accused him in a statement of trying to ' coerce states to fall in line with the same - sex " marriage " agenda			1
' six hours after the coalition 's pres conference , its online petition to @entity37 had collected fewer than 4,000 signatures			1
rev. @entity95 ( 4th from l ) said tuesday that @entity6 ' will go down in history as the worst attorney general ' the gay marriage debate has divided @entity8 , with supporters seeming to have captured the momentum in recent years blacks and evangelicals are the two demographic groups most opposed to same - sex marriages , a fact brought into sharp relief by tuesday 's launch of a black pastors ' movement to impeach @entity6 ' attorney general holder has attempted to undermine the states ’ authority ... specifically with his latest directives to @entity7 employees to interpret same - sex " marriage " status as broadly as possible even in those states which do not recognize these unions , ' the petition reads in part			1
' the attorney general has brazenly overstepped the bounds of his authority and he must be held accountable			2
' newly minted @entity125 virginia attorney general @entity47 believed his state 's ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional , so he has chosen not to defend it -- a move @entity6 hopes more of @entity47 's colleagues will embrace members of the @entity135 attorneys @entity133 , the more conservative half of @entity6 's tuesday morning audience , slammed him for his selective approach to law enforcement			1
' a state attorney general has a solemn duty to the state and its people to defend state laws and constitutional provisions against challenge under federal law , ' @entity141 attorney general @entity140 said in a statement			1
' to refuse to do so because of personal policy preferences or political pressure erodes the rule of law on which all of our freedoms are founded			0
a government that does not enforce the law equally will lead our society to disrespect the rule of law			0
' but six @entity125 state attorneys general , including @entity42 newcomer @entity47 , have chosen to sit on their hands while gay advocacy groups and individual plaintiffs have sued over state laws that limit the definition of ' marriage ' to a union between one man and one woman			1
herring 's inaction paved the way for a federal judge to strike down a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriages			0
the case will be appealed , but only as a procedural matter aimed at hurrying a final disposition			0
the @entity181 , a group supporting the plaintiffs in that case , said monday that ' loving gay and lesbian couples and their families should not have to live one more day as second - class citizens under unjust laws			2
' @entity189 , the group 's executive director , said he hoped that ' soon all @entity191 – and hopefully all @entity8 – will have the freedom to marry the person they love and their rights fully realized			2
' quieting the masses : president @entity11 , @entity6 and advisor @entity197 met feb. 18 with leaders from @entity2 civil rights groups in the @entity201 of the @entity202 , but reportedly focused health care and his ' income inequality ' platform @entity206 reported that @entity208 president @entity207 blasted @entity6 on tuesday , saying that ' state attorneys general are obligated to defend state marriage laws			1
' @entity207 called it ' unfortunate and outrageous that attorney general holder does n't understand that , but it 's hardly surprising			1
' coalition of @entity217 founder rev. @entity95 told reporters tuesday that ' our leaders in @entity3 are letting [ @entity6 ] get away with his illegal conduct			0
' ' he will go down in history as the worst attorney general , ' @entity222 said			2
the petition , he added , is meant to give @entity135 in @entity37 ' the encouragement necessary to remove this dangerous ideologue from public office			0
' as gay marriage has gained legal footholds in more and more states , president @entity11 's usually rock - solid @entity2 community has wavered , consistently polling low approval numbers for the practice			2
americans in black households disapprove of gay marriage in larger numbers than any other ethnic subset of the @entity8 a june 2013 @entity242 survey found that just 39 per cent of blacks support gay marriage initiatives , compared with 51 per cent of the larger population			1
but 69 per cent of blacks also acknowledge that the legal recognition of same - sex marriages is inevitable , according to @entity242			0
twenty - two per cent of self - identified evangelical @entity249 support gay marriage , while 70 per cent see it as an unstoppable social force			2
that combined gulf – between black @entity249 ' desires and their practical predictions – presents a public opinion - shaping opportunity that the pastoral coalition hopes to take advantage of			0
unstoppable : most blacks and evangelicals concede that despite their objections , gay marriage rights are likely to steamroll their way into @entity2 history @entity222 also said tuesday that he would move to impeach the president if it were practical to do so			0
' if @entity11 was a white man , he would be impeached , ' he told reporters			0
' @entity11 has been given a free pass to do what he pleases , but i do n’t give him a pass			0
been black all my life			0
he does n’t get a pass			0
' @entity222 called it unfortunate that the president has drawn lines of equivalency between the gay rights movement and the earlier @entity280 aimed at correcting historical injustices against blacks in the @entity8 ' it 's a disgrace that this man has stood on the shoulders of @entity286 and @entity287 , " @entity222 said			2
' i detest them calling this a civil rights movement			0
it 's not a civil rights movement ; it 's a civil wrongs movement			0
' but @entity6 has persisted in treating gay rights as a natural heir to the 1960s movement that relegated ordinary discrimination of african - americans , now considered shocking and unacceptable , to @entity8 's historical dust - heap			1
' if i were attorney general in @entity299 in 1953 , i would not have defended a @entity299 statute that put in place separate - but - equal facilities , ' @entity6 told @entity303			1
according to the @entity304 , @entity6 has told @entity305 in an interview for a future article that he will likely step down by the end of 2014 , but plans on staying ' well into ' the year .			0

the @entity8 attorney general believes he 's found a way to force the gay - marriage issue in states that refuse to recognize them
*democratic* state attorneys general , @entity6 said , are justified in sitting on their hands when state ' traditional marriage ' laws are challenged in court
a group of black pastors *responded* by launching an online petition calling for his impeachment and removal from office
they say @entity6 swore an oath to *protect* and defend all laws , not just those he finds morally and ethically acceptable
