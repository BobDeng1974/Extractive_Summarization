rescued : @entity1 female jihadi @entity0 sent a lawyer to secure her release from a @entity8 prison so she could join the terror group in @entity10			1
eighteen - year - old @entity0 describes in her blog how @entity13 commanders arranged for a lawyer to come to the prison and persuade the @entity8 authorities to free her and two other female fighters			1
she said the lawyer ‘ worked some magic ’ after they were arrested near the @entity8 border and jailed			1
@entity0 , who is now living in the is - run city of @entity22 , northern @entity10 , with 16 - year - old @entity1 jihadi twins @entity24 and @entity25 , says she feared she was going to be sent back to @entity1			1
it is not clear whether the is lawyer went to court to argue the case or simply made legal representations on behalf of the three women			0
in her diary @entity0 recounts that when she first arrived in @entity8 earlier this year she met two other @entity34 female jiahdis			2
but when they tried to cross the border into @entity10 they were all arrested and imprisoned by the ‘ @entity8 military ’ on suspicion of being members of @entity13			1
@entity0 , who married a @entity40 jihadi recently killed in @entity41 , says on her @entity43 blog : ‘ we tried to act like @entity10 but they made us lift our niqab up and they knew we were n’t @entity10			1
so the @entity44 [ @entity8 ] military men took us to their base and were questioning us whether we were with “ @entity48 ” [ is ]			0
‘ we completely denied all claims and said we were aid workers lol			0
’ the @entity8 authorities were so concerned about the women that the next day they booked them on return flights to their home countries			0
@entity0 recounts : ‘ me and the sister ’s [ sic ] were just annoyed cause we were being sent back to @entity58 [ land of non-believers ]			1
‘ @entity61 ( @entity13 ) found out about our predicament and sent us a lawyer who worked some magic and after a looooong tiring week in prison they let us go , @entity67 [ all praise to @entity69 ]			0
’ while jihadis waging war in the @entity74 are vocal in their hatred of western society , those from @entity1 are greedily devouring @entity78 products like @entity79 and @entity80 on the frontline , it has emerged			2
bounty and @entity84 bars , energy drinks and non-alcoholic beer are among top treats for foreigners fighting for @entity4 ( @entity13 ) in @entity10 and @entity89			2
it has been estimated that between 500 and 2,000 brits have joined thousands of other foreigners fighting for the group			0
but despite @entity13 rejecting ideals of civilised states , its fighters are happy to lap up the @entity99 ’s goods , including junk food and other gadgets , such as the latest iphones			0
one shopkeeper based in the central @entity10 city of @entity105 , told the @entity106 : ‘ these snacks were either unknown , or luxuries we could n’t afford			1
‘ but when the fighters requested them , i did n’t ask questions			0
i ran to my supplier and placed an order			0
' after the @entity13 lawyer had secured their release , the three women and their five children – all under the age of five – made a second attempt to cross the border , but were stopped and imprisoned again			1
this time one of @entity0 ’s two friends used the guard ’s mobile phone to contact her husband , an @entity13 fighter , and after he spoke to the officials , they were all released			2
@entity0 adds : ‘ then we went outside and there was a car outside for us but i still was very paranoid , so we went in the car and inside was the man who had interrogated us			2
‘ so this guy drives ... to another boarder [ sic ] controlled by @entity61 and we did n’t even have to run across			0
they opened the gates for us and we entered shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam by the will of @entity138			0
’ although the case can not be verified as @entity0 has chosen not to reveal her true identity , it shows how far @entity13 is able to infiltrate @entity8 ’s border security to bring fighters and their families into @entity10 .			1

@entity0 claims she was rescued by an @entity147 lawyer
@entity1 jihadi , 18 , had been arrested trying to cross @entity10 border
she feared she would be sent back to @entity1 after she was arrested
now she is living in an @entity147 - run @entity10 city with @entity1 jihadi twins , 16
