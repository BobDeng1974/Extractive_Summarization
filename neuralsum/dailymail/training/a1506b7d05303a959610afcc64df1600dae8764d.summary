in 1948 , the @entity1 government launched several inquiries into @entity4 sightings , which many believed were sparked by @entity6 paranoia			1
in what became known as ' @entity8 , ' more than 12,000 encounters with @entity4 were looked into by the @entity10			1
now , decades after the files were closed , the microfilms have been made available online for free – allowing anyone to re-examine the evidence			2
sitting in the centre is @entity22 , the last chief officer of @entity8 the @entity10 says that the @entity8 included 12,618 sightings reports , with 701 of which remained ' unidentified ' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files			1
the files , which can be accessed here , were previously only available by visiting the @entity27 in @entity28 , according to a report in openminds.tv			2
' there is plenty of work for amateur investigators to try to come up with explanations they never had time to consider or research , ' @entity32 author of the @entity4 investigations @entity34 told @entity35			1
one case that mr @entity32 is particularly intrigued in for historical reasons is a report filed by @entity46 which led to the popular term ' flying saucers '			0
mr @entity46 saw nine ufos over @entity50 , on 24 june 1947 and the @entity1 government agencies took an interest in reports			2
a similar sighting ( pictured ) occurred over @entity55 , @entity56 on july 12 , 1947 the information was transferred online after @entity58 , who runs a website called @entity60 , submitted thousands of @entity61 ( @entity61 ) requests @entity8 was the name for a project that investigated @entity4 reports between 1947 and 1969			1
it was the third study of its kind			0
the first two were projects @entity70 ( 1947 ) and @entity71 ( 1949 )			0

the @entity10 says that @entity8 included 12,618 sightings reports , with 701 of which remained ' unidentified ' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files			1

mr @entity46 saw nine ufos over @entity50 , on 24 june 1947 and the @entity1 government agencies took an interest in reports			0
a similar sighting occurred over @entity55 , @entity56 , just a month later on july 12 , 1947 ' they flew in a diagonal formation that stretched about five miles from the first to last craft , and they bobbed about erratically , ' said mr @entity32			0
' he estimated that they travelled faster than 1,000 miles per hour as they flew from @entity50 to @entity94			0
' when describing the sight to newspaper reporters , mr @entity46 said it was ' like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water			0
' this , said mr @entity32 , reveals that the term flying saucer came from the description of the movement of the craft rather than their appearance			0
' explanations from mirages , secret aircraft to the flight of pelicans have all been used to try to explain his sighting but it still remains a mystery , ' he added			0
the once - top secret files were previously only available by visiting the @entity27 in @entity28			2
