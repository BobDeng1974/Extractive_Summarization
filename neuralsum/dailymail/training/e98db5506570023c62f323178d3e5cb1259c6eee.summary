nearly seven in 10 @entity0 believe the @entity1 should shut its doors to foreigners traveling from countries that have seen cases of the ebola virus , and six in 10 say there should be a total ban on incoming travel for everyone – including @entity0 – who want to enter the @entity1 @entity11 are overwhelmingly against issuing travel visas to people who have been to the ebola hot zone , with 90 per cent favoring the no - room - at - the - inn approach			1
older @entity0 also preferred a closed - door policy by large numbers			0
the @entity11 also leads the field in asking for travel restrictions on anyone entering the @entity1 from @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
more than three - fourths of @entity11 hold that view , compared with barely half of @entity28			1
republicans also far outstrip @entity28 on the question of 21 - day forced quarantines for those entering the @entity1 from affected countries			1
two - thirds of @entity35 think isolating potential patients is a must - do			1
barely one in three @entity28 agree			0
the stunning results come from a @entity41 / @entity40 poll that surveyed 1,000 @entity0 , suggesting they 're eager to see the @entity43 @entity42 embrace the position of @entity45 – which shut its borders last tuesday to all travelers from ebola - stricken nations – and of @entity49 , which followed suit on friday			1
@entity51 to read the full polling results close the borders : significant majorities of @entity0 believe no one ebola - land should be allowed to enter the @entity1 – not even @entity0 who have traveled to the worst - hit countries @entity58 : just 34 per cent of @entity0 say they have faith in president @entity43 to manage the @entity61 crisis the right way moving forward slow and steady wins a giant @entity63 : the @entity43 administration should have been quicker on the uptake when @entity61 first hit the @entity1 , according to 55 per cent of @entity0 , while just 29 per cent say the @entity42 was n't too slow to act @entity0 overall are split on the question of mandatory @entity61 quarantines , with 48 per cent saying they believe ' people who have been to ebola - infected areas should be quarantined by the government for 21 days			1
' another 29 per cent believe only those showing symptoms of the disease should be forced into isolation			0
older @entity0 are the most likely to demand quarantines.fully 57 per cent of @entity0 65 or older fall into that camp , compared to just 41 per cent of those age 18 to 29			0
and @entity11 are 75 per cent more likely than @entity28 to insist that the government isolate travels who have been to @entity80			2
the @entity43 administration gets low marks for its handling of the crisis			1
just 10 per cent of @entity0 approve of the job ' ebola czar ' @entity85 is doing , with 40 per cent saying they have never heard of him			1
only 2 per cent of @entity11 say he 's doing a good job , but @entity28 do n't support him either			1
less than one in five of them approve of @entity85 's work on the issue			2
fewer republicans than @entity28 – 24 to 44 per cent – have no idea who he is , an indication that @entity85 , a longtime @entity28 political operative , has become a lightning rod on the right			1
fully 54 per cent of @entity0 age 29 and under say they have no idea who he is			0
@entity104 ? @entity43 's ' ebola czar ' is n't exactly a rousing success , with 40 per cent of @entity0 saying they 've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he 's doing a good job @entity108 : while more than half of @entity0 approve of encouraging doctors and nurses to donate their talents in ebola - stricken nations , a similar majority thinks that same volunteerism puts public health at risk back in the @entity1 fifty - five percent – including 61 per cent of @entity11 but just 13 per cent of @entity28 – agree that the administration has been ' slow to react			1
' african - americans match @entity28 ' 13 per cent showing , largely supporting the @entity42			0
@entity43 himself only wins plaudits from 34 per cent of the @entity1 population , compared with 49 per cent who disapprove of how he 's handling it			1
not surprisingly , just 10 per cent of @entity11 approve of how the president has responded to the @entity61 crisis			1
perhaps more shocking is that 35 per cent of @entity28 would n't agree			0
@entity43 continues to be a racially polarizing figure as he tackles the public - health threat , the @entity41 / @entity40 poll shows , with 51 per cent of blacks , 46 per cent of @entity132 , but just 29 per cent of whites backing him			1
a similar split dominated the question of whether @entity0 ' have faith ' in the president to handle the problem moving forward			2
fifty - eight percent of blacks say they do , compared to 29 per cent of whites			2
just 16 percent of blacks have their doubts			0
the @entity144 , which drew jeers for allowing an @entity61 - infected nurse to fly on commercial aircraft , has the support of 39 per cent of @entity0 , four percentage points lower than the 43 per cent who disapprove of its performance			1
@entity11 hard - liners : more than two - thirds of @entity11 told @entity40 's pollsters that they believe the federal government should forcibly quarantine people who enter the @entity1 after spending time in @entity61 - affected nations @entity28 @entity157 : fully 62 per cent of @entity28 believe there 's no need for a 21 - day quarantine when people enter the country from @entity22 , @entity23 or @entity24 the @entity43 @entity42 has assumed a leading role in the global fight against the deadly disease , which has infected more than 10,000 people in @entity80			1
but barely one - third of @entity0 say the public - health mop - up is the responsibility of the @entity1			2
nearly half say it 's not			0
the administration 's efforts have included deploying military men and women by the thousands to help build field hospitals in @entity22 and build other critical infrastructure			2
the @entity144 has also encouraged scientists and medical personnel to volunteer their time and skills in the ebola hot zone			0
but while more than half of @entity0 think it 's a good idea to nudge doctors and nurses toward western @entity80 , they feel the opposite about uniformed servicemen and women			0
@entity0 , those under age 29 , are the most likely to have their doubts about putting a lab - coated cadre of temperature - takers in harm 's way			0
just 44 per cent of them approve and one - third are undecided – making them the largest demographic group to be scratching their heads over the question			2
most of the @entity1 medical volunteers who have served or are serving overseas combating @entity61 are under age 30 , according to a physician source at @entity200 , an international medical relief charity			2
a clear majority , 53 per cent , say the federal government should not be ' sending military personnel to ebola - infected areas of @entity80 to help battle the disease			1
' that number includes 67 per cent of @entity11 but just 40 per cent of @entity28 , an unusual case where dovish liberals prefer to deploy troops and hawkish conservatives would rather not			2
just three in 10 overall approve of the @entity213 's deployments			0
34 per cent for @entity43 : the president barely has one - third of @entity0 behind him as he battles the @entity61 scourge , and nearly one - half disapprove of how he 's handling it reserving judgment on @entity220 : the pugnacious @entity222 governor who insists his quarantine policy is the right path has left nearly 2 in 5 @entity0 unsure what to think – but he 's winning over more than he 's offending @entity226 : the @entity144 has a five point approval - gap on @entity61 , with 39 per cent saying the agency is doing well and 44 per cent disagreeing – and among those with strong feelings , the dissenters outnumber the applauders nearly two - to - one the thorny question of what happens to @entity0 who have been exposed to the ebola virus is still vexing the @entity43 administration			1
already more than 100 military personnel , including a commanding major general , have entered 21 - day quarantines on an military base in @entity241 – to the consternation of the @entity241 military stationed there			2
and nurse @entity245 's refusal to remain isolated during the disease 's potential incubation period became national news after she returned from @entity80 via the @entity250 , @entity222 airport			0
she had a 101 - degree fever when she was tested hours after her arrival			0
@entity245 spent three days in a hospital isolation tent before the @entity144 cleared her to go home to the far northern reaches of @entity256			0
she has defied public health authorities since then by taking bike rides and strolls , shaking hands with reporters – including one from @entity41 – and doing her own shopping			1
the @entity41 / @entity40 poll found that more than half of @entity0 believe that by giving a green light to medical volunteers , the federal government ' could increase the risk of @entity61 being brought to the @entity1			1
' bring them home : a majority of @entity0 think it was a mistake to send military servicemen and women to western @entity80 , where they have been building field hospitals and providing infrastructure help – but also potentially exposing them to the deadly ebola virus inside the numbers : @entity28 who approve of sending soldiers into @entity61 's path far outnumber @entity11 who back that approach not our problem : just 36 percent of poll respondents said they agree that it 's @entity1 's job to lead the global @entity61 response , while 48 percent said it 's not this week @entity245 and the @entity43 administration both crossed swords with @entity222 governor @entity220 , a feisty @entity11 who refused to back down from his insistence that health care workers who show disease symptoms must be quarantined before they can enter the interior of the @entity1 from the @entity250 airport			1
@entity43 objected , blaming @entity220 – although not by name – for stoking fear by adopting a more stringent disease control regime than the @entity144 's , and the @entity42 may have the public - opinion upper hand			2
only one - third of @entity0 say they approve of @entity220 's approach			0
