militant union chiefs were humiliated yesterday as they called off strike plans after admitting their threat to the start of the @entity4 had prompted ‘ abuse and vitriol ’			1
@entity7 , general secretary of the @entity8 , insisted he had ‘ no regrets ’ about plotting the strike , which had been planned to cause chaos on @entity13 ’s borders today			1
the climbdown came hours after ministers revealed that more than enough border staff had volunteered to work to ensure @entity17 , which is expecting its busiest ever day as thousands arrive for the @entity19 , operated as normal			1
mr @entity7 sought to save face by claiming the @entity29 had agreed to create an extra 1,100 jobs , 800 at the @entity31 and 300 at the @entity32			1
but ministers said no posts were being created in response to his strike threat , and they had been planned for some time to plug vacancies			2
it also emerged that only 400 are being recruited at the @entity31			0
the 800 figure came about because of an administrative error in two job adverts			1
fury : home secretary @entity43 wrote an open letter to border staff urging them to defy the walkout and ' do what their country needs ' before the deal was done deal : @entity8 general secretary @entity7 claims the deal shows the government admits to making too many cuts to staff @entity57 , the immigration minister , said : ‘ no concessions have been made by the government			1
posts are being advertised to fill gaps left by normal staff turnover			2
‘ we are pleased that the @entity8 leadership has seen sense and called off this irresponsible strike which was not supported by the majority of members			2
‘ during the past week , our staff have shown fantastic dedication and commitment during an extremely busy period			0
‘ queues at @entity17 have been almost non-existent and athletes and visitors from around the world have received a welcome of which the country can be proud			2
’ mr @entity7 admitted the strike had triggered a backlash , with critics warning it would bring shame on @entity13 with the eyes of the world on this country			0
he said : ‘ we have been subjected to the most extraordinary level of vitriol and abuse in the last week [ since the strike date was announced ]			0
the abuse directed at front - line public sector staff is completely and utterly unwarranted			0
’ mr @entity7 said it was absurd to have paid hundreds of workers to leave under the government ’s austerity cuts , only to take more on			0
work - to - rule : @entity97 workers have been instructed to do no more than the minimum required in their contracts from friday @entity102 staff , taking visitors to @entity4 events in @entity105 , will also work - to - rule during the @entity19 ‘ the taxpayer has actually paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in terms of redundancy and severance payments , in many cases to people who would much rather have been at work , ’ he added			1
a spokesman for airports operator @entity114 said : ‘ so far passengers arriving for the @entity4 have had a smooth journey through @entity17 and it is great news that those arriving tomorrow can also expect a warm welcome to @entity97 and the @entity19			1
’ the row has renewed calls from senior @entity123 for a change in the law to ensure strikes can no longer be legally called on the basis of tiny turnouts of union members			0
only 11 per cent of @entity8 members voted to strike			0
