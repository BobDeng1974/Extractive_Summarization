they are more commonly seen being transported on ships and at ports around the world			0
but with the addition of flatscreen tvs , en - suite bathrooms and air conditioning , these shipping containers are now being billed as a solution to @entity11 ’s housing crisis			1
the containers come from @entity13 and are transformed into studio apartments in @entity15 which can be stacked on top of each other - and are available to rent for only £ 75 a week			1
the scheme looks set to take off after the council granted planning permission to the @entity22 's @entity21 ( @entity23 ) to establish two sites in @entity25 , north - east @entity11			1
it is thought each of the homes could save taxpayers £ 25,000 each year by taking people off housing and other related benefits			0
@entity33 , 30 , is a former @entity23 resident who hopes to be one of the first people to take advantage of the scheme once the sites are completed			2
the receptionist said : ‘ the idea of being able to get your own place for £ 75 per week and not have to be living with a shared bathroom in @entity11 is just unheard of			0
at the @entity23 : the scheme looks set to take off after the council granted planning permission to the @entity22 's @entity21 to establish two sites in @entity25 , north - east @entity11 reading light : the so - called @entity70 - which cost £ 20,000 each - are designed to allow young people to have their own rental accommodation but at a price that allows them to save up for a deposit washing up : @entity33 , 30 , is a former @entity23 resident who hopes to be one of the first people to take advantage of the scheme once the sites are completed ‘ it is so difficult for people on low income wages to pay their rent and travel costs and still have money to live on and that is very demoralising and a lot of people are left feeling like “ why do i bother ? " ' the idea of being able to get your own place for £ 75 per week and not have to be living with a shared bathroom in @entity11 is just unheard of ' @entity33 , 30 , who is hoping to live in a @entity92 ‘ it will be quite a story to tell friends that you “ live in a shipping container ” but the units really are going to be great as they have air conditioning systems that will allow them to stay cool in the summer and warm in the cold winter months			1
’ a @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ we developed @entity70 as a direct response to the mounting financial issues faced by our vulnerable young residents when they try to make the transition from supported housing to independent living			2
‘ young people who gain full time employment , and are no longer in receipt of benefits , are often unable to afford the costs of renting a property privately in @entity11 and the associated costs of securing a home			0
modern : the homes were developed for @entity23 residents , but bosses are prepared to sell or lease @entity70 to individuals or organisations committed to providing non-benefit based accommodation low - cost : they contain a flatscreen tv , en - suite bathroom , air conditioning and cost £ 75 per week to rent how they once appeared : a cargo ship packed with containers at @entity133 in @entity134 ( file picture ) ‘ @entity70 offer an affordable solution to this problem , and they enable our residents to save for a deposit and the other financial requirements of living independently			1
’ this is not the first time that shipping containers have been adapted into homes			1
@entity146 reported last november how a housing trust in @entity148 wanted to use 36 adapted containers as a stop - gap for people without a permanent home			0
the containers were transformed into self - contained studio flats , and feature bathrooms , kitchens and plasterboarded walls			1
the structures were designed for a social housing project in @entity160 in 2010 , but the scheme was abandoned after funding issues			0
high property prices , steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside town have contributed to high levels of homelessness			0
the homes were developed for @entity23 residents , but bosses are prepared to sell or lease @entity70 to individuals , housing organisations , churches and local authorities committed to providing non-benefit based accommodation			1
@entity23 chief executive @entity179 said : ‘ we ’ve been overwhelmed by the support the @entity182 project has received since its inception			2
‘ equally , we ’ve encountered so many obstacles and objections , but all of our hard work and persistence has paid off			0
‘ this is n’t just great news for us at @entity23 , but for the sector as a whole , as the @entity182 project will now have its opportunity to prove itself as a credible solution to the affordable housing crisis that is affecting so many young people			2
' last month it was claimed by the body which represents @entity11 's councils that more than 800,000 new homes must be built in the capital by 2021 to keep up with housing demand .			0
