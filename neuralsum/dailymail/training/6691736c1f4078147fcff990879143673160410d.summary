but should you have no idyllic meadow to frolic in , then these new flip - flops could be the answer			2
the soles are lined with surprisingly lifelike synthetic grass , giving you the feeling of strolling across a freshly mown lawn whether you 're indoors or out			0
the grass is greener : these flip - flops from @entity14 will give you that barefoot - on - the - grass feeling even when you 're padding around your living room the shoe comes in men 's and women 's versions , with a rugged green strap for chaps and a charming daisy for women			1
it 's not exactly like going barefoot in the park , but for a touch of nature with no need to water or mow , it 's not a bad substitute			0
just do n't take them off while sitting on the lawn , as it will be tricky to find them again			0
