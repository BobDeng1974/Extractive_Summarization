harking back to @entity3 transformation show @entity4 , people on the street are asked to guess a woman 's age in a bold new advert			2
a @entity9 model starring in a television film for @entity11 is filmed and photographed as she ' ages ' an average of five years throughout a typical working day			1
the @entity17 public observe her appearance and proceed to judge her as older - from as young as 26 to as old as 40 - as the day progresses			0
at 7am the actress looks bright and bushy tailed , ready for the day ahead - studio lights capture this in the ad but by 9.47 she looks exhausted as she prepares the family dinner and does the laundry after a day at work the working mother - of - two is seen drying her hair first thing , dropping her two young children off at school , working out , working on a computer in the office , food shopping and more as a camera follows her every move			1
she is photographed at the beginning of her day and at the end - at 7am and 9.47pm - and both images are then judged independently by people on the street			2
looking at the morning photo , strangers generally thought she looked somewhere between her late twenties or early thirties , but with the evening photo , they guessed she was in her late thirties and forties			0
researchers found she looked five years older in the evening photograph compared to the morning image based on the average ages guessed			0
the advert for @entity11 's @entity54 ends with the statement ' in only one day , fatigue can age you by five years			1
' , followed by the answer to all your problems : ' but a miracle can change everything '			0
if there 's a best way to sell face cream , this creation by @entity17 agency @entity65 would surely take top prize			2
probably because it can make you feel awful about yourself			0
the powerful advert for @entity11 's @entity54 has gained widespread coverage the mother - of - two in the short film is photographed at the beginning of her day and at the end both images are judged independently by people on the @entity17 streets - who guess vastly different ages strangers thought she looked somewhere in her late twenties or early thirties in the morning , but by evening , they guessed she was in her late thirties and forties researchers found she looked five years older in the evening photograph compared to the morning			1
