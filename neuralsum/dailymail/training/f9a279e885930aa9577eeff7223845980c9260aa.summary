last week she released a catchy new song called welcome to @entity2			1
and her enthusiasm for the @entity4 was cemented yesterday , when @entity5 was announced as global welcome ambassador for @entity2			1
appearing on @entity7 , the 24 - year - old , who was born in @entity10 , @entity11 , and grew up in @entity12 , said : ' i 'm so enthusiastic about this city that i feel like , when i love something , i 'm very vocal about it , i 'm vocal about it with my music			1
' as part of her role , the singer presented a series of videos for @entity2 's official tourism agency , @entity33 , including one in which the singer explains some common slang words , such as ' stoop ' ( commonly known as a porch ) and ' bodega ' , the 24 - hour corner shops which sell ' almost anything '			1
@entity43 heart @entity2 : @entity5 , pictured enjoying the sights in august , is a passionate @entity2 fan ' a lot of heart ' : the singer explains that @entity2 are friendly to tourists and the city is easy to get around in another video , she assures visitors that in @entity2 , ' people are very friendly and there 's also a lot of heart here			1
and it 's easy to get around			2
people will help you if you ask for help			2
' but it seems not everyone is quite so upbeat about her appointment			0
the singer , who recently bought a £ 12million apartment in the trendy @entity64 area , has lived in the city less than a year , and residents were shocked that she was selected to represent the city			1
no stranger to the bright lights : the singer performs on @entity71 2013 in @entity72 enjoying the @entity4 : the pop star recently bought a £ 12million property in the city 's @entity64 neighbourhood ' what makes @entity2 @entity2 is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world			1

it 's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in @entity2			1
' i think what brought me to @entity2 is still a little bit of a mystery to me			1
' every day i would wake up with this feeling , like i need to be in @entity2			1
it pulled me here like a magnet			0
' i was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud , and now i know that i should run towards things like that			0
' i should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric			0
' there 's so much happening right in front of me , so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career			2
' just moments after the announcement was made , the decision was attacked by @entity2 , who felt the singer was not suitable for the role			1
' i 'm incensed ! it 's insulting , ' said @entity114 singer @entity114 , who was born in @entity115			1
he told the @entity117 : ' she does n't have any life experience here , or connection to the town			0
' there 's so many others — @entity127 , for instance , if you want a big name , ' @entity114 added			0
' but @entity5 is the pop culture queen , so she moves into town , and she 's the ambassador			0
' the @entity130 page was flooded with negative responses			0
' @entity5 has nothing to do with @entity2 , she is a bad representation			2
get a real @entity134 instead , ' commented @entity135			0
' seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador , ' wrote another poster , @entity138			0
but @entity139 stood by their decision , saying : ' we could n't have asked for a better synergy between @entity5 and @entity144 to tell our story about what makes @entity2 , @entity2			2
' ' this is a campaign targeting visitors to @entity2 rather than locals , ' they told @entity151			2
' there 's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals			0
