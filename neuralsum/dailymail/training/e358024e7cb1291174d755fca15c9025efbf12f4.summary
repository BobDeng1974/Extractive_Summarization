as landings go , this will be one of the trickiest ever attempted			0
on august 6 @entity4 ’s @entity3 , packed inside the @entity6 spacecraft , will hurtle towards the @entity8 surface at around 13,200mph – and has just over six minutes to slow down and make a soft landing			1
what ’s more , the craft has to be at just the right angle for the descent to be a success – likened by one @entity4 scientist to firing a golf ball from @entity17 to land in a hole at @entity19 ’s in @entity20			2
the mission 's entry , descent , and landing ( @entity25 ) phase begins when the spacecraft reaches the top of @entity8 atmosphere , about 81 miles ( 131 kilometres ) above the surface of the @entity31 crater landing area , and ends with the rover safe and sound on the surface of @entity8			1
gently does it : curiosity will be lowered down by a @entity6 craft fitted with retro boosters speedy : the @entity6 spacecraft , with @entity3 inside , will hit the @entity8 atmosphere at 13,200mph red alert : curiosity will probe the @entity8 environment using highly advanced instruments during the @entity25 , the three - ton spacecraft decelerates from a velocity of about 13,200 miles per hour ( 5,900 metres per second ) at the top of the atmosphere , to stationary on the surface			1
most of the enormous deceleration needed will be achieved by friction with the atmosphere			0
in the final stages a parachute will be deployed and the @entity3 will pop out of the main craft attached by nylon tethers to a @entity6 fitted with retro rockets			1
this craft will hover above the surface and gently lower curiosity down			0
how @entity3 will make its nervy landing on the @entity8 surface size matters : the @entity6 is the biggest and most sophisticated planet - roaming machine ever to be deployed it ’s a set of manoeuvres that ’ll leave staff at mission control with sweaty palms			1
dr @entity67 , director of @entity4 's @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 , where the probe was built , told @entity72 : ‘ we will be very nervous			0
landing on another planet is not a walk in the park			0
it 's very challenging and there have been mixed successes and failures in the past			0
’ in 2003 , for instance , @entity84 ’s @entity83 probe lost contact with @entity87 as it came into land and was never heard from again			2
@entity67 added : ‘ the reason we are nervous is that it 's about 3 tonnes of mass … equivalent in terms of energy to 25 high - speed trains going at full speed			0
in addition , the accuracy we have to point to be at the right angle is equivalent to me being in @entity17 and hitting a golf ball to land in a hole on @entity19 's golf course in @entity20			2
’ about to have a blast : the @entity6 , with @entity3 inside , being transported to the launch pad up , up and away : the rocket carrying curiosity took off successfully on november 26 last year @entity4 ’s most advanced mobile robotic laboratory will examine one of the most intriguing areas on @entity8			1
curiosity is a rover with more scientific capability than any ever sent to another planet			2
it will set down inside a huge crater and use its highly advanced instruments , including cameras and lasers , to find out more about the planet ’s environment , which will help pave the way for human missions			2
@entity121 , director of the @entity122 at @entity123 in @entity124 , said : ‘ @entity6 builds upon the improved understanding about @entity8 gained from current and recent missions			1
‘ this mission advances technologies and science that will move us toward missions to return samples from , and eventually send humans to , @entity8			1
’ the one - ton rover will examine @entity31 during a mission that will last nearly two years			2
curiosity will land near the base of a layered mountain three miles ( five kilometres ) high inside the crater			2
the rover will investigate whether environmental conditions have ever been favourable for development of microbial life and preserved evidence of those conditions			0
@entity145 , project scientist for the @entity6 at the @entity146 in @entity69 , said : ‘ @entity31 gives us a superb opportunity to test multiple potentially habitable environments and the context to understand a very long record of early environmental evolution of the planet			0
‘ the portion of the crater where @entity3 will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water - carried sediments			1
layers at the base of the mountain contain clays and sulphates , both known to form in water			0
’ curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as earlier @entity8 rovers @entity166			1
the rover will carry a set of 10 science instruments weighing 15 times as much as its predecessors ' science payloads			0
a mast extending to seven feet ( 2.1 metres ) above ground provides height for cameras and a laser - firing instrument to study targets from a distance			0
instruments on a seven - foot - long ( 2.1 - metre - long ) arm will study targets up close			0
analytical instruments inside the rover will determine the composition of rock and soil samples acquired with the arm 's powdering drill and scoop			1
other instruments will characterise the environment , including the weather and natural radiation that will affect future human missions .			1

the robotic lab is *due* to land on @entity8 on august 6
rock , soil , weather and environment will all be studied by the @entity3 rover
