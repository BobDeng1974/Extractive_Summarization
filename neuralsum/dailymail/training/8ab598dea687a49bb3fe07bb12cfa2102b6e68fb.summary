a bitter wind blows off the @entity1 but the mother polar bear and her two cubs standing just 50ft in front of me are in their element			1
for more than an hour i watch from a boat just offshore , transfixed and oblivious to the below - freezing temperatures , as the four - month - old twins gambol across the snow			0
for years polar bears have been the poster boys of global warming – routinely reported to be threatened with extinction due to melting ice - packs and rising sea temperatures			2
hope : despite concerns about future extinction , polar bear populations appear to have stabalised indeed , when they were put on the @entity26 endangered species list in 2008 , they were the first to be registered solely because of the perceived threat of global warming			1
one prominent scientist said their numbers would be reduced by 70 per cent by 2050 while global warming proponents – including @entity33 and sir @entity34 – used emotive imagery to highlight their ‘ demise ’			1
yet there is one small problem : many polar bear populations worldwide are now stable , if not increasing			1
according to a report compiled this year on @entity42 polar bear populations by academics at @entity44 , @entity45 , only one out of 13 areas showed declining numbers			1
in fact , in some areas numbers have steadily increased			2
in the @entity53 area in the @entity54 , aerial surveys show polar bear numbers have risen from 2,200 in 1994 to 2,580 in 2010 , while the population in @entity57 has increased from 935 in 2004 to 1,013 in 2011			1
great year : this bear was photographed in @entity59 , @entity60 , where the population is growing at the same time , a new report to be published tomorrow from the @entity63 says that while global warming is a fact , the situation in some areas is not as bad as was predicted in 2007			1
last week i travelled to @entity59 , @entity60 – an @entity69 village of 239 hardy souls on @entity71 at the edge of the @entity1 – which has become an unlikely boom town thanks to an influx of polar bears			1
village administrator @entity76 , 26 , beamed as she told me : ‘ this has been a great year for the bears			1
' they are fat , happy and healthy			0
we ’re seeing a boom in tourism which brings much - needed revenue to the village and helps us continue to live the traditional life we cherish			2
‘ i ’ve lived here all my life and there are more bears every year			2
i read stories about polar bears being on the brink of extinction because of global warming , look out of my window and start to laugh			2
’ for decades , large - scale hunting had decimated the polar bear population , and in 1973 a global hunting ban was imposed			1
in the 1960s , @entity99 scientist @entity98 estimated that global numbers as low as 5,000 to 8,000			2
good news : mail on sunday reporter @entity104 travelled to @entity59 last week to check progress but today , even the @entity106 cites estimates of 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears living in @entity42 , @entity109 , the northern @entity99 coast , islands off the @entity112 coast , and the north - west @entity60 coast			1
in @entity59 , bear numbers are embraced in the @entity116 sub-population and the most recent study by the @entity118 in 2006 reported that numbers had dropped from 1,842 bears to 1,525 over the previous five years			1
a new study is under way with a report due early in 2014			0
but on @entity71 it is a more positive story : official figures have fluctuated from 51 , when records started in 2002 , to a pitiful ‘ low ’ of only 18 bears in 2010			0
but there were a record 80 bears recorded last year and this year @entity118 puts the figure at 58 , though locals believe it is higher			2
@entity132 , who heads the ‘ nanook patrol ’ which keeps the bears out of the village in @entity59 , said : ‘ bears come and go			2
they are notorious for going long distances			0
‘ authorities say there are 58 but that ’s just what they counted here in @entity59			0
they also monitored a wider area from the air and counted 91 bears			0
boom town : the rise in polar bear numbers is bringing in tourists who are eager to catch a glimpse of them ‘ i took a trip outside town yesterday and came across another 20 bears			1
people here think there are more bears than ever			0
’ others , however , disagree , and say that while @entity59 appears to have plenty of bears , it does n’t mean there is a healthy wider population			0
guide @entity164 said : ‘ any idiot can see that climate change is affecting us here			0
there is no ice where there should be ice			0
’ @entity172 , 74 , a former pilot who now owns the 11 - room @entity175 hotel , agreed			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve been here 50 years			0
we used to have icebergs floating offshore at this time of year and the ice would come right in , even during summer			0
‘ now it ’s 150 miles offshore			0
the bears are hungry so they are coming here looking for food until the ocean freezes and they can head back out to hunt seals			0
’ those who insist the bear population is healthy are not popular			0
dr @entity185 , an evolutionary biologist and expert on polar bears , was criticised as a ‘ climate change denier ’ when she published a paper called @entity190 earlier this year			1
population forecasting expert dr j @entity191 agrees : ‘ the decision by the @entity193 in 2008 to name the polar bear as an endangered species because of global warming was based on flawed information			1
' the fact is it is almost impossible to get an accurate figure for the number of polar bears – they do not stay in one territory			2
’ seeing the polar bear in the wild is a privilege – but perhaps , thankfully , no longer the rare sight we had previously been led to believe .			1

polar bear populations have stablised and may even be increasing
this is despite dire predictions of 70 per cent decline in numbers by 2050
one *resident* of @entity60 village says ' this has been a great year for bears '
