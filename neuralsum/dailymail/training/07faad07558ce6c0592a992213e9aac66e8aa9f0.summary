by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has bowed to public pressure and says it will remove unnecessary nut allergy warnings from products such as ham , baked beans and even tonic water			1
the supermarket triggered anger among allergy sufferers earlier this year after ‘ may contain nuts ’ warnings were added to hundreds of products without good reason			1
sufferers were left confused about what was safe to eat after the warning appeared on everything from cooked ham to apple juice , tonic water , bags of new potatoes and baked beans			1
nut allergy sufferers found they could not buy hundreds of products including apple juice and potatoes the firm has finally relented after refusing to remove the labels which ' comply with @entity30 rules ' thousands of people signed a petition calling on the store to remove the warnings			1
@entity2 initially rejected the complaints , saying it had changed the format of its labels to comply with @entity30 rules due to come in later this year			1
but @entity40 ’s biggest grocer has now relented , admitting it went too far and announcing that the warnings will be removed from many of the products			2
a spokesman said : ‘ recently , how we label has changed and in that changeover the “ may contain ” statement has been put on products it should n’t and caused a lot of confusion and anguish among our customers – for which we are very sorry			0
’ he said @entity2 ’s policy was to carry warning labels only where there was a genuine risk and the company had asked suppliers to review the need to apply the nuts safety message to packs			2
‘ the risk assessments for products with a “ may contain ” statement are being reviewed and where following that review we ca n’t demonstrate there is a significant risk of cross-contamination we will remove the “ may contain ” statement , ’ he added			0
campaigner @entity72 , whose three - year - old son is allergic to nuts , welcomed the change of policy , but said the campaign would continue			0
‘ while we obviously welcome @entity2 ’s admission after weeks of claiming otherwise that they did get their labelling wrong , we now want @entity2 to engage with us properly and fully until the situation is resolved , ’ she told the @entity78			0
‘ we expect to be kept informed of which items will see the “ may contain ” labels removed and when			0
‘ @entity2 also needs to dramatically improve its communications with allergic consumers : we are entitled to full explanations of risk for specific products and will absolutely not be fobbed off with any more generalised and , indeed , factually incorrect responses from ill - informed staff			0
