@entity1 's father was told by @entity13 's key lieutenant @entity7 to take his own life and return his wealthy family 's fortune to the state or his two young sons would be executed			1

payout : @entity1 , who was part of the team who killed @entity7 ( pictured in book ) , has been awarded $ 2.8bn damages following his father 's forced suicide during the @entity19 revolution in 1959 a judge in @entity40 ordered the @entity4 government to pay damages to mr @entity1 , 72 , after his father - who had the same name - was given the ultimatum to take his own life in order to save his sons			1
despite being the biggest ruling of its kind , however , mr @entity1 will have huge difficulty obtaining any of the payout money , as @entity4 does not recognise @entity51 court rulings and has only $ 200million of seized assets in @entity53 , which are being claimed by other exiles			2
@entity56 , the wealthy owner of a law firm and @entity59 plant worth $ 15million a year , was targeted by @entity13 's anti-capitalist agenda as soon as the @entity4 revolutionary toppled president @entity62 in 1959			1
the family 's home was stormed , mr @entity56 was imprisoned and interrogated and his family captured before he was given the suicide ultimatum in february the same year			0
regime : mr @entity1 's family were targeted during the @entity4 revolution by prime minister @entity13 , right , and his key lieutenant @entity7 , left after his father 's death , @entity71 fled @entity4 and moved to the @entity51 after continued persecution of his family and his late father 's car business by @entity13 's regime			1
mr @entity1 joined an anti-communist @entity4 exile group and after joining the army took part in the failed 1961 @entity82 - led @entity81 to topple @entity13			1
he later worked with the @entity82 , and was part of the team that tracked down @entity7 in the @entity86 jungle eight years after his father 's death in october 1967			1
two years ago a different judge awarded @entity1 more than $ 1billion in damages for the death of his father			2
@entity4 â€™s government has flatly refused to pay similar damage awards in the past , leaving lawyers scrambling to find assets linked to @entity96 around the world they can attempt to seize			0
@entity99 ' @entity98 ' @entity7 was born in @entity100 in 1928			0
he studied medicine but during a trip through @entity53 when he was 23 he became politicised by the poverty he witnessed			0
@entity7 became involved in @entity105 social reforms until the @entity51 @entity82 overthrew the president @entity106			0
the rebel later met @entity13 and brother @entity108 in @entity109 and sailed to @entity4 in 1956 to fight successfully against @entity4 dictator @entity62			0
@entity7 worked within @entity4 following the revolution and oversaw a national literacy campaign and redistribution of wealth			2
he was captured by @entity51 - backed forces and executed on oct 9 1967 in her ruling this week , @entity116 circuit judge @entity115 found that @entity4 's actions ' rose to such a level of depravity ' that they amounted to torture and that @entity4 must pay billions of dollars in damages			2
judge @entity115 wrote that mr @entity56 was ' told repeatedly that he , his sons , and his wife would be killed , unless he acquiesced to the turnover of his property and took his own life '			0
mr @entity71 's attorney , @entity128 , said he will attempt to collect by tapping frozen @entity4 assets in the @entity51 and @entity4 - linked businesses around the world			2
mr @entity128 told @entity132 : ' he 's ecstatic at the court ruling , but he 's been through an awful lot ... one of his primary motives in bringing this case was to avenge his father 's death			1
' his life has been the biggest rollercoaster in the world			0
' imagine a leader of a nation that knows you personally , curses your name and wishes you ill , wishes you an unpleasant death , and has attempted to assassinate you periodically over a period of decades , then you will understand what mr @entity1 has endured			2
' @entity51 courts have issued a number of similar judgments against @entity4 over killings , imprisonment and confiscation of property			0
some people have collected sizeable amounts by going after bank accounts and similar assets , but others have managed to find very little			0
@entity13 , 85 , handed the @entity4 presidency to his brother @entity108 in 2006 after 49 years in power			0
after fleeing @entity4 , mr @entity1 later joined an anti-communist rebel force on the failed @entity82 - led mission to topple @entity13 , seen here at the @entity167 in 1961			1
