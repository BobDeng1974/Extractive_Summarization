by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has got links golf cracked			1
the way to win @entity5 at @entity6 this week is this : ' just do n't play bad			1
' if only it were that easy , @entity8 could gloss over a miserable sporting summer by celebrating a homegrown winner of the @entity11 and anticipating another @entity2 tour de force at the @entity13 in september			1
in the pink : @entity2 believes that @entity5 and @entity15 offers his best chance of winning a major but @entity2 knows links golf can be brutal			1
he went to the famed layout at @entity20 last week with the purpose of getting ' beaten up ' to prepare himself for @entity5			1
he got just that : a second - round knockout			2
still , @entity2 will pick himself up off the canvas for his latest attempt at claiming that elusive maiden major championship			1
no matter the missed cut in @entity30 , the 38 - year - old will have more than a puncher 's chance at claiming the game 's ultimate prize this week			2
@entity2 is engaging in fighting talk already , insisting that @entity5 , along with @entity15 , represents his best chance of winning a major at long last			1
' i love links golf , ' he says			2
' i 'm looking for a big finish			0
i want to get my hands on that illustrious piece of silverware			0
' wrong trousers : @entity2 made a sartorial double bogey at @entity44 in 2004 eye - catching : @entity2 followed up @entity46 trousers ( left ) by wearing flamboyant plus - fours at @entity44 ( right ) @entity47 fit to play on thursday from the moment he dared to show up in that pair of @entity46 trousers at @entity44 a decade ago , @entity2 has often been the talk of @entity5			1
but since that sartorial double bogey , @entity2 has also proved that when it comes to links golf he truly can wear the trousers one day ( just perhaps not that particular pair )			1
two top 10s in his last two opens suggests that the man who now calls @entity59 home has his best chance of landing one of the game 's four big prizes back across the pond			1
blistering late charges through the field at @entity68 in 2008 and @entity69 last summer have led to second and third place finishes			0
there is one obvious leap left to take			0
relaxed : @entity2 shares a joke with @entity75 's son @entity74 during practice round on monday but what about @entity20 last week ? rounds of 73 and 74 suggested he had not yet regained his touch playing @entity81 seaside golf			1
@entity2 has been here before though			2
not least at @entity6 in 2006 when he missed the cut by some margin while @entity84 gave his masterclass in strategic tee shots ( or the ' stinger ' in more animalistic parlance )			2
the lessons learned that year , playing alongside @entity90 in his final @entity5 , and a rather harsh reminder in @entity30 last week are what gives @entity2 confidence in such a simple outlook for this week			1
' links golf will highlight any error , ' he admits			0
' there 's nothing more to learn than understanding if you hit a bad shot you will be punished severely			0
' there 's a lot of ways to see how to play @entity6 but you have to be on every aspect of your game to compete			2
it depends on the weather			0
if we get the same conditions as 2006 everyone will be playing it the same way as @entity116			0
' you have to stay out of the bunkers			0
you have to make sure you 're not making silly mistakes			0
they come from being too aggressive off the tee			0
it 's a strategy everybody will consider			0
given the big , flat - ish greens at @entity6 , this could be a tournament won by a man with a dead - eye on the greens – @entity2 's most dangerous weapon			1
but is the @entity130 – to use his @entity13 nickname – ready to deliver at last in a major ? ' i feel very happy with my game			2
i feel fit and ready , refreshed and ready to go , ' he calmly asserts			0
popular : @entity2 signs autographs for fans during a practice round in @entity6 on monday but calm is not how most @entity8 golf fans want to see him this week			1
could playing in front of home support be the key to unlocking that eyes - bulging , fist pumping , @entity143 - slaying maniac ? ' it 's always good to play in front of home fans , they love their golf , ' he says			2
' they 're very partisan and passionate and they get right behind you			0
it 's great , you ca n't ask for more than that			0
' there 's not enough events in the @entity81 anymore to satisfy the fans			0
we have so many great fans and so few tournaments			0
but that means when @entity5 comes along they get right behind their players			2
' and if there 's one more way to stir that inner @entity13 beast , being paired with two @entity143 on thursday and friday might just do the trick			1
@entity168 and @entity169 , who are both likely to be in @entity171 's team in @entity172 , had better watch out			1
the @entity130 is on the prowl			0
see how @entity2 gets a little help from @entity175 and @entity176 before @entity5			1

the @entity5 and @entity15 offer him best chance of winning a major
@entity8 has finished in the top 10 in his last two opens
