the mom of a three - year - old who works in fast food , a man who just graduated from a study course aged 49 , another who cares full - time for his mom - and two men who are in prison			1
they may seem very different , but these people have something in common - their lives have been blighted by an addiction to methamphetamine			1
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 became the public faces of drug abuse when their mugshots were used in the @entity24 campaign in 2004 - and are still recognized for it today			1
and - thanks to an extensive investigation by @entity27 - with some making steady progress kicking the drug , holding down jobs and making their way in life			1
she now works as a manager in @entity40 's today : @entity15 is now out of jail and has a managerial job at @entity43 - as well as a son to look after decline : the above mugshots show how the drugs aged @entity16 , who has done 17 years of jail time out and working : @entity16 now has two jobs - and graduated from an education program in june reporter @entity51 tracked down six of the eight drug users who featured in the campaign , which was born from a project by a sheriff 's deputy at the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58			1
deputy @entity59 was the ravaged faces in front of him every day , and compiled mugshots of the most extreme examples into a drug prevention package which made it round the country thanks to its stark , visual message			2
some of those featured later revealed that they hated the fact that their problems were made so public - while others are glad if their pictures turn anybody away from the same path			2
@entity15 was tracked down by @entity27 to a home in @entity77 , an hour outside of @entity57			1
despite last being arrested as recently as 2012 , the 38 - year - old has managed to turn her life around , splitting her energies between caring for her son and working as a manager at a @entity43			1
shocking : images such as these - showing @entity84 - were compiled in the @entity24 campaign , which showed the stark physical effects of using the drug grizzled : @entity89 , now 51 , is another former addict whose image was featured in the attention - grabbing campaign she began using meth as early as 12 , she said , while she was living in foster homes around @entity57			1
she later became homeless and worked as a prostitute - but now has something to live for and is trying to shake her association with the drug			0
she said : ' everybody knows your name here , but i 'm trying to be a good mom			0
now , i 'm a manager at @entity43			2
that means something to me			0
' @entity16 , 49 , graduated from an education program this year in @entity57 and now holds down two jobs : working in a warehouse and delivering home equipment			1
but the former addict , also a father , has spent a total of 17 years behind bars - and during one of the appearances landed in the campaign			1
speaking at the graduation ceremony , he said : ' i want to make amends to the city and be a role model so my son ... will make it out , too			2
' he told @entity27 he hopes to be an addictions counselor and help others			0
@entity17 is a third who made it out and is now clean			1
he started using the drug aged just 15 , while travelling with his carnival worker parents , and ended up homeless in @entity57 - where he says the generosity of locals meant he had no trouble supporting his habits by begging			0
troubled past : @entity17 , pictured above in successive mugshots , started using meth when he was just 15 now : @entity17 is now married and cares for his mom in their @entity138 , @entity139 home			1
he says participating in the campaign - and potentially turning people away from meth - makes him feel better in an interview with the newspaper , he said : ' other people should see what [ meth ] does			1
' even though i 'm dumb enough to do it , if i can convince anybody else from doing it , that makes me feel better			0
not everybody has to be as dumb as i was			0
' though he was once a gang member - and has the tattoo to prove it - he says it has been seven years since he used the drug			2
he now lives with his wife and ill mother , whom he cares for , in @entity138 , @entity139			1
however - the stories of those whose images were turned into a weapon against the drug that so damaged them are not uniformly positive			0
two of the eight faces are still behind bars - and one admits he is likely to start using again once he gets out			0
@entity18 , 52 , has been using meth since he was 14			2
and he told the paper that as soon as he is let out of @entity173 , @entity174 , he will probably start up again			0
pocked : @entity18 , 52 , has one of the most shocking set of mugshots			2
but according to a recent interview , he will take up meth again once he leaves jail in @entity174 arrested not long after a pressure cooker exploded while preparing the drug , his pockmarked faces from 2000 is one of the most shocking in the series			2
he said he hopes to keep living in @entity174 with his girlfriend once he leaves jail - and to pay his way by fixing up then selling his dad 's @entity189 ranch			0
@entity19 , 50 , is also in jail - this time a correctional facility in @entity57			0
he has spent just over half his life inside and has repeatedly tried to quit meth			0
hoping to fix it : @entity19 , shown above , has spent more than half his life in jail - but now has a son and hopes to stay clean when he is next released for his sake missing link : @entity201 , shown above at the times of her arrests , could not be found for an update but he said that once he is released next month he will approach the task with renewed vigor because he now has a son - which could spur him to leave the drugs behind			0
two more of the subjects - @entity84 and @entity201 - either could not be found or would not agree to be interviewed - but their shocking images of decline continue to form be used as a tool in the war of meth .			0
