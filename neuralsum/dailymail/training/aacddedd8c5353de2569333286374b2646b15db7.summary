a former beauty queen has undergone an incredible surgery where a quarter of her skull was removed and stored in her stomach while she recovered from a devastating head injury			1
surgeons removed the rear quarter of @entity9 's skull and placed in her abdomen so that the bone would remain sterile and nourished as her brain swelling subsided			1
when the mother - of - three and former mrs. @entity15 woke up from the operation she found the large , hard lump in her stomach and a portion of her head missing			2
the skull remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was re-attached in a successful operation and now , three months after her near death experience the 36 - year - old has returned home			1
accident : @entity9 , who was mrs @entity15 2009 , slipped during a fishing trip and hit her head on a boulder			1
as he brain swelled , doctors took out part of her skull ( right ) for more than a month to protect the brain writing on a blog post about her near death experience , @entity37 , who won mrs. @entity15 in 2009 and competed in the @entity40 beauty contests , said : ' nothing in this world really matters to me today other than @entity44			1
i am on this glorious earth with my unbelievable family			0
' i can snuggle my kids , kiss my husband , hang out with my mom , and live			0
my heart feels like it could explode with gratitude			0
my cup is running over with joy and happiness			0
is everything in my life perfect ? no. but today i am alive ! ' @entity37 's brush with death came after she joined her husband @entity60 and brother - in - law @entity61 on a salmon fishing trip to @entity63 in @entity15 in june			1
as @entity37 tried to reel in her first fish she lost her footing and fell 12ft on to a boulder			0
her husband scrambled down to his wife and found her unconscious , without a pulse and not breathing			0
safe : the skull was put in her stomach to keep the bone nourished for after the brain swelling went down in hospital : after 42 days , the piece of skull was then put back into @entity37 's head in a successful operation when @entity60 lifted her , she began breathing again and nearby @entity80 called for emergency services			1
@entity37 was airlifted to @entity82 in @entity83 where doctors found her brain had swollen			2
with her family warned that the next 72 hours would decide if she lived or died , they took the decision to remove a quarter of her skull until the brain swelling went down			1
the skull portion remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was removed and placed back on her head			1
as she came round from the operation she called the doctor over to her and said : ' thank you for what you have done			0
you have saved my life ! ' on her blog site where her recovery was detailed @entity37 , from @entity83 , @entity15 , spoke about the moment her skull was replaced			2
on the mend : @entity104 , 36 , has been blogging about her progress and has returned to work support : @entity37 , who was mrs @entity15 in 2009 , has three children with her husband @entity60 , pictured ' @entity111 went as well as expected ! my skull is back in my head ... really weird to say ; ) , ' she said			1
' stitches this time , not staples ! they are scheduled to come out august 3rd			0
yeah ! so for now the only possible problems , are infection , or my body rejecting the skull being back in my head			2
' your prayers are felt and appreciated ! never in my life have i felt the prayers and faith of others in my behalf			0
thank you ! ' @entity37 posted a photo of the skull in her abdomen on her blog page entitled ' miracles believe in them ' as well as a photo showing a scar running the length of her head			2
