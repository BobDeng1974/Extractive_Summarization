ever since he has used a humble dslr camera to capture breathtaking shots - including solar prominences , sunspots and even a plane crossing the face of the sun. despite being 93 million miles from the sun , amateur astronomer @entity4 has captured this stunning shot of a solar prominence from his back garden mr @entity4 , 54 , from @entity21 , near @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ' capturing solar activity is a challenge			1
but i am happy because there 's always some activity to photograph			2
it is a show every day and it looks so different each time			0
' i learned a technique using my dslr which helps me capture 15 images per second			1
it means i now capture 900 images over a few weeks and , later , pick the 100 best			2
' once i honed this technique , it was easy for me to click through my fixed telescope			2
' mr @entity4 says he spends hours gazing into space , hoping to spot scintillating solar activity			1
the weather , however , is the biggest challenge he faces			0

pictured is a solar prominence he added : ' the main difficulty is the turbulence			2
in order to get good solar images , everything has to be very stable			2
clouds do n't help either			0
' some of mr @entity65 's most amazing images are of solar prominences			1
the red - glowing looped material shown in the pictures is plasma , a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium			0
the prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun ’s internal dynamo			0
hot sunspots dot the surface of the sun , as seen through the telescope captured by @entity4 in @entity82 , near @entity22 with the sun in the backdrop , mr @entity4 captured a passenger jet forming a subtle silhouette an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward , releasing the plasma			1
others pictures highlight giant sunspots			0
sunspots form from shifting magnetic fields at the sun 's surface , and are actually cooler than their surrounding solar material			1
mr @entity4 says he now hopes to push his hobby even further - capturing more detailed shots of the sun 's intense activity			1
@entity4 's telescope fixed to a dslr camera and rest of the equipment seen at his home in @entity82 , near @entity22 , @entity23			1
incredibly , the equipment used cost him no more than £ 2,900 some of mr @entity65 's most amazing images are of solar prominences			1

now , i want to see the interiors of the sunspots. , ' he said			0

mr @entity4 added : ' i have an achromatic refractor ( meade ) and solar telescope ( lunt )			1
this equipment helped me do all these images			0
' my solar equipment is very simple and basic			0
it costed me no more than 3,500 euros ( £ 2,900 )			0
it has worked well for me so far			0

@entity4 from @entity138 , near @entity22 , took the photos from a small observatory on the terrace of his house
the 54 - year - old says he spends hours on the terrace gazing into space , hoping to spot scintillating solar activity
he has developed a technique to take 15 images per second using a humble dslr camera and a solar telescope
images include stunning close - ups of solar prominences , sunspots and even a plane crossing the face of the sun
