trust in the @entity1 to control @entity3 's borders has halved in the four years since @entity4 promised to cut net migration to under 100,000 , dramatic polling data shows			1
in 2010 almost half of voters ( 47 per cent ) said the @entity1 had the best policies on immigration and asylum , but the figure has slumped to just 21 per cent			1
it comes as the prime minister finalises a major speech outlining another crackdown on @entity18 migration , in which he will be forced to admit he has broken his promise to keep net migration to the tens of thousands			1
mr @entity4 pledged at the last election to cut net migration to the levels last seen in the 1990s			1
in 2011 , he said this would happen by 2015 , ‘ no ifs , no buts ’			0
but quarterly figures due to be released on thursday are set to show that net immigration is still above 240,000 a year			1
the @entity25 polling shows just one in five ( 21 per cent ) think the @entity1 are best placed to deal with immigration and asylum , down from 47 per cent in may 2010			1
only 16 per cent backed @entity46 , down one point , and just five per cent backed the @entity48 , down nine points			2
ex-cabinet minister @entity50 called on the prime minister to set a course for @entity3 to leave the @entity18 altogether at the same time , suppport for ' other ' parties has risen sharply , up 21 points to 27 per cent			1
the bulk of these voters are likely to be switching to @entity57 , which has made major gains in the polls by putting immigration at the heart of its pitch to the electorate			2
the latest data from @entity25 also shows 25 per cent of people most trust @entity57 leader @entity68 to tackle immigration , ahead of mr @entity4 on 19 per cent			2
mr @entity4 knows he must persuade voters he has a deliverable plan to deal with immigration in order to lure them back from the @entity57 fold			0
he is understood to be considering banning @entity18 migrants from receiving in - work benefits , such as tax credits			1
about 250,000 are thought to receive the income top - ups , costing £ 1.6billion a year			0
but leading @entity81 @entity80 said this would be ‘ totally discriminatory ’			0
‘ you have an @entity85 working alongside a @entity86 doing the same job , they both pay the same taxes			0
and the @entity85 gets the tax credit and the @entity86 does n’t , ’ he said			0
eurosceptic @entity81 mps stepped up pressure on the @entity92 today , demanding he set a course for @entity3 to leave the @entity18 altogether			1
@entity50 , the former environment secretary , proposed that @entity3 invokes @entity94 50 of the @entity95 – the mechanism for an @entity18 exit , which has never been used before			1
it would legally compel the @entity18 to negotiate the terms for a @entity3 exit within two years			2
if all 27 other @entity18 countries approved a new deal for @entity3 , it could be put to voters in a referendum in 2017 – otherwise we would leave , he will say			2
@entity105 insisted that the missed net migration target remains the ' objective ' to which the prime minister is working , as he finalises his major speech			1
however , home secretary @entity110 has admitted it is ' unlikely ' that the net migration target would be met before the general election in may , and said the government had been ' blown off course ' by the @entity116 crisis			1
the latest data from @entity25 shows 25 per cent of people most trust @entity57 leader @entity68 to tackle immigration , ahead of @entity4 on 19 per cent mrs may has until now insisted the government could meet its pledge to slash migration to below 100,000 by the next election two weeks ago , mrs may called the pledge a ‘ comment ’ and an ‘ aim ’ rather than a ‘ promise ’			2
and on the @entity130 ’s @entity129 yesterday she went even further			0
pointing out that levels of @entity133 immigration are now similar to at the end of the 1990s , she said : ‘ but it is , of course , unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the @entity140			1
‘ why is that ? it ’s because we have seen increasing numbers of people coming from across @entity145 , partly because our economy is doing better than other economies in @entity145			0
’ she added that free movement was ‘ one of those key issues that we are going to negotiate on , adding : ‘ this is an issue that we see as centre stage but increasingly is seen by other countries as an issue they need to address			0
’ net migration to @entity3 has returned to levels last seen under the @entity46 government when a quarter of a million more migrants were moving to @entity3 than leaving every year however , today @entity160 insisted the prime minister had not abandoned his target and still hoped it could be met			1
' it very much remains the objective towards which he is working and the reasons why remain the same , ' the prime minister 's official spokesman said			2
' that 's why he has not changed his view , it is the right approach			0
' the government has already taken action to tackle bogus colleges , employing illegal immigrants and introducing exit checks			0
' in terms of whether or not more needs to be done , we know that that is the pm 's view , ' the spokesman added			0
shadow home secretary @entity180 said the @entity81 pledge was ‘ in tatters ’ , adding : ‘ continually making and breaking grand promises on immigration is only undermining confidence in the entire system			0
’ @entity187 , the head of the home affairs select committee , said that migration policy was ‘ a mess ’ .			0
