scientists have announced they are closer than ever to the ‘ holy grail ’ of biochemistry : artificial photosynthesis			1
by observing the first stage of the process in action , they say they ’ve got a better understanding of how plans turn carbon dioxide into oxygen			2
and ultimately it may be an important step to a future where artificial plants are created that are more efficient than their organic siblings			0
scientists have observed the water splitting process in plants that creates oxygen , known as photosystem ii. the cycle , illustrated here , has four steps			1
the largest change is between steps @entity24 and @entity24 , so this is the part the scientists ' zoomed in ' on to capture their freeze - frame the groundbreaking research published in @entity28 was carried out by an international team led by @entity31 ( @entity31 ) scientists			1
the process through which plants absorb light using chlorophyll to produce chemical energy in the form of oxygen , glucose and more is called photosynthesis			1
during the process glucose is used by the plants to breathe or is converted into starch , while oxygen is released as a waste product – in turn giving us the air we need to breathe			2
the rate of photosynthesis is altered by differing carbon dioxide levels and light intensity			0
if either is increased then the process will also increase , up to a limit			0
temperature also plays a part , with a higher temperature increasing the rate			0
however if the temperature is too high , beyond @entity57 , the rate slows down			0
photosynthesis provides most of the energy necessary for life on @entity61 to exist			0
but no way to artificially mimic the process has yet been created , leaving us dependent on plants to survive and thrive			0
in the study they were able to observe the first snapshots of photosynthesis in action as it split water into protons , electrons and oxygen			2
this is the process that maintains @entity61 ’s oxygen atmosphere and ensures air is made up of the things we need to breathe it and survive			2
‘ this study is the first step towards our ultimate goal of unraveling the secrets of water splitting and obtaining molecular movies of biomolecules , ’ said professor @entity81 , professor of chemistry and biochemistry at @entity31 and leader of the research team			1
photosynthesis is one of the fundamental processes of life on @entity61			0
the early @entity61 contained no oxygen and was only converted to the oxygen - rich atmosphere we have today 2.5 billion years ago by the ‘ invention ’ of the water splitting process that occurs in photosynthesis			1
this water splitting process is known as @entity103 ( @entity103 ) , which produces the oxygen we breathe and ultimately keeps us alive			0
revealing the mechanism of this process is essential for the development of artificial systems that mimic and surpass the efficiency of natural systems			0
in the study they were able to observe the first snapshots of photosynthesis in action as it split water into protons , electrons and oxygen			2
this is the process that maintains @entity123 s oxygen atmosphere and ensures air is made up of the things we need to breathe it and survive the development of an ‘ artificial leaf ’ is one of the major goals of the @entity132 for @entity133 , which was the main supporter of this study			2
director of the centre professor @entity137 explained that they are trying to find a way to turn water into oxygen gas , hydrogen ions and electrons just like plants do			0
‘ photosynthetic organisms already know how to do this , and we need to know the details of how photosynthesis carries out the process using abundant manganese and calcium , ’ he said			0
‘ once the mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation is understood , chemists can begin to design artificial photosynthetic catalysts that will allow them to produce useful fuels using sunlight			0
’ the team , led by @entity160 , used the world 's most powerful x-ray flashlight at the @entity163 to record still frames of the molecule complex @entity103 as it splits water into hydrogen and oxygen			1
‘ this is the very first scene of a molecular movie showing light - driven water splitting in @entity103 , the mechanism which makes all oxygen in the atmosphere , ’ said @entity81			2
co-author professor @entity172 from the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) added : ‘ a deeper understanding of photosynthesis could , for instance , aid the development of better solar cells and might advance the quest for biochemistry 's holy grail , artificial photosynthesis			1
’ the process through which plants absorb light using chlorophyll to produce chemical energy in the form of oxygen , glucose and more is called photosynthesis			1
shown is a @entity194 cell , which was an early form of plant life that converted the @entity61 's early atmosphere into a breathable one to observe photosystem ii in action , the team grew tiny nano - crystals of the photosystem ii complex of bacteria that employ photosynthesis , cyanobacteria called @entity204			1
these crystals were illuminated with a visible laser to start the water splitting process , which is otherwise driven by sunlight			0
the researchers used double light flashes to trigger the transition and , with the short and intenses x-ray laser flashes , were able to monitor how the molecular structure changed in the process			1
this provided just enough time to freeze - frame the water splitting process for 30 quadrillionths of a second			1
but that was enough to glean the snapshot of the process in action - and now they ’ll be hoping to take the research further and see the rest of the photosynthesis process .			1

team led by @entity31 observes photosynthesis in action
they were able to take a freeze - frame of plant process that creates oxygen
they observed the molecular changes using x-ray flashes at a *lab*
this snapshot lasted just 30 quadrillionths of a second
and the research could be used to make artificial leaves , the so - called ' holy grail ' of biochemistry
