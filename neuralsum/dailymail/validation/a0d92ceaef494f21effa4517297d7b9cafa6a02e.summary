the magic and wizardry in @entity3 ’s feet has already earned him a special mention from one of the @entity8 rugby team ’s most famous fans , @entity9			1
with a flash of quickstep and family connections to @entity14 , the full - back certainly has the ability to light up any game			2
but memories of last year ’s shocking 20 - 0 defeat by @entity19 at @entity20 still pain the @entity22 - born 22 - year - old , even though he remains hopeful about unlocking the curse of @entity25 , where the @entity8 have not won since 1983			1
@entity3 is aiming for a first @entity25 win for @entity27 since 1983 @entity3 and his team - mates have not had a happy campaign at home or away in the @entity31 this year @entity3 ( centre ) tries to shake off the attention of @entity35 player @entity34 in the @entity31 game @entity3 is desperate to inspire @entity27 to victory over @entity19 at @entity25 on saturday @entity38 author @entity9 included @entity3 in a story about the wizarding world @entity19 ’s @entity42 - winning coach sir @entity41 was particularly scathing of the @entity27 performance that day under @entity44 , claiming they were so toothless they would have been beaten by an also - ran @entity47 side			1
‘ last year ’s game is one that we always keep in the back of our minds , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ we never , ever want to experience anything like that again			2
it was probably the worst game i ’ve ever been involved with in a @entity27 jersey			1
our performance was really poor but we ’ll draw upon that experience when we go down there			2
’ looking out onto the scene of that @entity20 defeat , @entity3 speaks candidly about @entity19 ’s second - class opinions of @entity8 rugby			1
he carries his heart on his sleeve on and off the field , with obvious frustrations about his nation ’s fruitless campaigns			2
he recalls the childhood days spent playing full contact rugby on concrete in the @entity74 and the afternoons working as a ball - boy for his local club			0
the speed and footwork that will be on show on saturday , he reveals , were first used for mischievous after - school escapades in @entity82			0
@entity3 says losing to @entity19 last year was the worst game he 's been involved in our man @entity83 sat down with @entity3 at the home of @entity8 rugby ahead of the @entity19 game @entity3 's @entity27 side have lost all three of their @entity31 games so far @entity3 breaks away to score the opening try during the @entity31 game against @entity91 in february ‘ i had a bit of pace when i was younger , so i could get away with things , ’ revealed @entity3			1
‘ i was quite cheeky , always winding up people and my mum would say : “ you get away with murder			0
” ‘ we used to play knock - door - run and then hide somewhere you could see folk opening the door			2
‘ the street i lived on was shaped like a horseshoe and we had another game called the @entity107			0
there were 20 houses and you would start at the first , running through all the gardens , jumping over the hedges and trying not to get caught			0
’ @entity3 was soon tearing down rugby pitches and went on to make his @entity27 debut as a 19 - year - old , coming on as a substitute against @entity91			1
having idolised @entity8 pair @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity120 legend @entity119 , he became the youngest player on the 2013 @entity123 tour to @entity124 where the coaches singled out his ‘ x-factor ’			0
@entity3 is hoping the @entity8 will be able to give @entity19 something to think about when they clash ‘ you want to get people on their feet and cheering , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ having fun is about beating players and smashing players			0
‘ the challenge for the modern - day coach is how you break down these big defences			0
there are lots of things you can do using footwork and chip kicks			0
the entertainment is still there , it has to be , or you wo n’t get 60,000 people coming to watch			0
‘ with @entity27 , we go out there to enjoy and express ourselves			1
i love running with the ball and the more space that we can create , the better			0
’ @entity3 ’s box - office style caught the eye of distant relatives in @entity158 , prompting them to get in touch and uncover the family connection to @entity161 legend @entity14 through his late grandmother			1
keeping up the sporting tradition , @entity3 played as a defender in junior football — although he claims to have had ‘ the touch of a baby elephant ’ — and is a fair - weather @entity169 and @entity170 supporter			1
@entity3 holds on to the ball in @entity27 's 22 - 19 defeat against @entity35 in their last @entity31 game @entity3 ( third left ) tries to get past @entity175 for @entity27 against @entity35 at @entity20 but rugby has always been his first love and he remains hopeful that @entity27 can deliver on the promise shown during head coach @entity180 ’s first autumn campaign last year			1
a narrow defeat by the @entity182 and victories over @entity184 and @entity185 suggested a change in fortunes			0
however , the @entity31 ’ defeats by @entity188 , @entity91 and @entity35 have stunted any progress made			1
the @entity8 are huge underdogs for the final two matches , against the @entity191 and @entity192 , but @entity3 is convinced they can still salvage something from a campaign in which they are in danger of picking up the wooden spoon			1
‘ @entity180 ( below ) was fairly quiet when he first came in but he is used to the environment now , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ a spade ’s a spade with @entity180			0
he ’ll not miss and hit the wall if he ’s got something to say			0
‘ in the past , the @entity8 have had a good autumn and then not backed it up in the @entity31			1
we said that we did n’t want that to be the case this time — but , unfortunately , it ’s not started the way we wanted			0
‘ but we still have two games that we ’re more than capable of winning			2
‘ against @entity19 , we need to shut down their key players , @entity211 and @entity212			2
they have been on fire of late			0
we played against them a couple of times with @entity216 , so we know what they ’re about			0
’ and what about those links with celebrity fan @entity9 ? she has mentioned on her website @entity222 that the fleet - footed @entity3 might be a @entity224			2
in @entity38 - speak , that means a person born to a least one magical parent , a wizard - born @entity227			0
@entity3 , for his part , will hope to discover his inner - wizard at @entity25 this weekend			1
‘ i ’ve met her a couple of times and she ’s a really nice lady , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i watch all the @entity38 films , so maybe we can have some of that magic			0

@entity3 is desperate for @entity27 to beat @entity19 at @entity25
@entity27 have lost all three of their @entity31 games so far
@entity3 wants to end that run and erase bad memories at @entity25
