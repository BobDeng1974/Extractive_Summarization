by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 11 january 2013 royal officials have submitted a secret planning application for substantial changes at the @entity5 mansion the @entity6 is reportedly planning to gift to the @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity10 is being asked to approve plans to re-route the existing driveway in order to make it more private as well as construct a new garden room at @entity15 listed @entity16 on her private @entity17			1
the application , which is described as a ‘ major development ’ in council papers , also involves converting a wood store into accommodation – which could be used for police guarding the couple - and extending an existing garage block to form an equipment room			1
country pile : @entity16 is a late @entity29 country house which sits in the grounds of the @entity17 estate and is just two miles east of the @entity6 's @entity17 @entity32 : the @entity8 spent much of his childhood holidays exploring the @entity15 listed house , pictured the application was submitted by the @entity17 estate office on behalf of the @entity6 on december 10 last year , but details were only revealed today			1
earlier this week it was reported that the 10 bedroom residence was being lined up by the monarch as a country home for @entity9 and @entity44 , who are expecting their first child			1
news of the new planning application will only heighten such speculation , particularly as attempts have been made to shroud it in secrecy			1
drawings and detail of the plans are not being revealed on the council ’s website for security reasons in the normal way			1
sprawling estate : the royal couple are expected to be given the country house by the queen @entity64 was lived in by the @entity8 and @entity65 from 1972 to 1990 and is now leased to @entity66 a planning application has been submitted to the council to make changes to the @entity29 property couple : the @entity8 and @entity9 pictured as the @entity9 left hospital after a severe bout of morning sickness			1
the couple are currently based in @entity76 , @entity77 the @entity6 and the @entity8 stay at @entity17 every @entity78 with the rest of the royal family and anyone who wants to see the plans has to be vetted by the police first and can only view them at the council offices in the presence of a planning officer			1
a decision on whether to approve the plans is set to be made by council officers using delegated powers sometime before march 11 , instead of local councillors			2
residents in the tiny village of @entity95 have been informed of the application , but no objections have been listed on the council ’s website			1
@entity16 is one of the 150 properties owned by the @entity6 on her 20,000 acre estate in north @entity5 and is only two miles east of @entity17			1
it is surrounded by estate farmland , giving @entity44 and @entity9 a high level of privacy as they gear up to start their own family			2
it is believed that the couple want to change the driveway to give them more privacy and improve access to the hall			2
at the moment the main entrance to the hall is about 100 yards down a tiny lane which is also used as a public road to @entity120 , where services are held twice a month			2
@entity16 which largely dates back to 1802 was one of the houses where prince @entity124 and his then mistress @entity125 , now the @entity126 , used to enjoy secret trysts , when it was rented by the prince ’s friend @entity129			1
@entity44 spent many childhood holidays playing in the grounds with the @entity129 boys , who are all close friends			0
it was earlier leased to the @entity8 and @entity65 as their country house from 1972 until 1990			0
the current tenant is @entity66 , who owns a kitchen and timber company , and has leased the property until 2017 , which means @entity44 and @entity9 ’s son or daughter would be three years old when then move in			0
the village of @entity95 lies between @entity144 and @entity145 , on the edge of the @entity17 estate details of picturesque @entity149 ( pictured ) but anyone who wants to see the plans submitted to the council has to be vetted by the police the village of @entity95 has no pub or shop and had a population of just 63 in the 2001 census , but it has a social club which is open on friday evenings and saturday lunchtimes			1
the club is home to darts and dominoes teams and is the headquarters of the @entity165 , which has a @entity167 motto translating as ' never make me sail '			0
@entity169 , 82 , who has lived in @entity95 for 74 years and has been in the hall several times , said : " i ca n't think that it would be anything other than good for the village			0
' it 's nice inside			0
it 's got lovely frontage , facing south , and it 's homely			0
it 's got quite a lot of grounds			0
that 's an ideal place for them to live and rear a family			0
' it 's isolated but surrounding the hall is the park where the child , or the children , will see the cattle , the sheep and get a general feeling of the countryside and rural life			0
' @entity196 , who moved to the village from @entity198 in 2007 , described the prospect of @entity201 neighbours as ' absolutely wonderful '			0
she added : ' i would not move back to a town now i live here in @entity95			0
it 's beautiful here all year round			2
' everybody gets on with everybody and it would be nice if they would participate in some of the things that go on in the village			0
' i would make them very welcome and i 'm sure other people in the village would as well			0
' @entity44 and @entity9 currently live in a rented farmhouse on @entity216 , where the prince is an @entity218 helicopter pilot			0
when they are not on @entity216 , they live at @entity221 , in the grounds of @entity76 in @entity77 , which has just one bedroom and has been described as ‘ cosy ’			0
however later this year they will move into the newly renovated @entity225 inside the palace itself , which was princess @entity228 ’s home , while prince @entity229 will have the cottage			2
picturesque : an aerial view of the country house owned by the @entity6 in @entity5 the new apartment will suit the couple ’s growing family , as it boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms			0
the @entity17 has been owned by the @entity6 since her accession in 1952 and by the @entity240 since 1862			1
although much of the land is open to the public , the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the royal family relaxing there – making @entity16 even more of an attractive proposition to the @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity247 has declined to comment			0
a spokeswoman for @entity10 said : ' a full planning application has been made and detailed drawings of the plans have been submitted			1
' the drawings and detail of the plans are not being revealed on the council ’s website for security reasons			1
' anyone who wants to see the plans has to be vetted by the police first and they can only view them at the council offices in the presence of a planning officer			2
' the application has had its normal consultation period of 21 days and it will probably be dealt with under delegated powers			2

the application was submitted to @entity10 on december 10 last year but details were only revealed today
plans *include* re-routing existing driveway and constructing a new garden at @entity15 listed @entity16 on @entity17
