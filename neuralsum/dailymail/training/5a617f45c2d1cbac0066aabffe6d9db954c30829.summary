by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:25 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 17:29 est , 18 october 2012 the wife of the @entity4 presidential candidate gave a passionate defense of the pro-life stance held by her and her husband during an appearance on daytime talk show @entity9			1
@entity10 said she will not be the one making the decisions but her husband , who is now running as a pro-life candidate in spite of serving as a pro-choice governor of @entity17			1
' the good news is , i 'm not running for office and i do n't have to say what i feel			2
but i am pro life			0
i 'm happy to say that , ' she said			0
' he could not have , on his conscience , creating human life for experimentation , ' she said in reference to mr @entity31 's decision against stem cell research during his time as governor			1
i think we all have to understand this is an issue that is so tender and there are people on both sides of the issue , with very good conscience , coming with a different opinion			2
' ‘ four years ago there were a lot of other issues on the table			2
what i hear from women now is “ help , please help , ” ’ she said arguing that economic problems facing mothers concern them more than reproductive rights issues			1
‘ if you really want to make a choice and those choices are about reproductive rights , that ’s your choice			1
’ as governor of the majority @entity76 state of @entity17 , @entity31 supported a pro-choice stance on abortion , but as he his campaign has grown now to appeal to the entire country , his position has dramatically shifted towards the right			1
currently , @entity31 says that he would prefer to have abortion rights decided on the state level , with exceptions when it comes to cases of rape , incest , or when the health of the mother is in jeopardy			1
@entity94 told , since 1994 , @entity31 has publicly said that he supports nine different stances on abortion rights			1
the issue has become a central one to this year 's presidential campaign as the next president will likely be in a position to appoint one or two new @entity103 justices who , in turn , could affect the @entity107 decision legalizing abortions			1
while her husband did not attend the show , she was accompanied by her middle son @entity112			0
@entity10 tried to make light of the fact that her husband cancelled an appearance on daytime talk show @entity9 because he thought that the show would be a high risk activity for him because the five female guests were all ' sharp - tongued and not conservative '			1
support : @entity121 joined his mother during the show , sitting in the audience and addressing one question from the all - female cast of hosts on the attack : mrs @entity10 said that more women were concerned about economic issues than reproductive ones ‘ no , he said sharp and young , ’ @entity10 joked			1
he responded to questions about his brother @entity135 's comments that while watching the most recent presidential debate , he wanted to ' take a swing ' at president @entity138 because of the accusations he was hurling at their father			1
' it 's hard when you 're in this process to see your dad get beat up out there ... you take it pretty personally			2
' i think that 's something he was saying off the cuff and i assure you he did n't mean it			2
' aside from the pointed political discussion about abortion rights at the beginning of the program , @entity10 , wearing a red dress adorned with zippers and a breast cancer awareness pin , focused largely on lighter issues like the chore wheel at their house , the family 's love of @entity166 , and her fondness of television			1
' i 'm a big tv fan , i just have n't had time to watch it , ' she said			0
she said that she has been avoiding television in general because she ca n't stand watching campaign ads. guests : @entity173 and @entity138 appeared on the show last month ' the @entity176 people are sick of campaign ads , am i right ? ' she said to the audience			0
considering the show is taped in @entity181 - a decidedly @entity76 state that has little chance of voting for mr @entity31 , very few of the audience members could claim to be inundated with ads. ' the audience members that are in swing states are sick of them , ' @entity10 concluded			1
as the co-hosts splashed a picture of the entire @entity31 clan , including her five sons and their respective families , she described somewhat chaotic dinners at their lake house in @entity195 , @entity196			0
after years of being stuck doing the lion 's share of chores after meals , she turned to the classic concept of a chore wheel			0
the big change this year was that all of the grandkids made it on to the list - and on the rounds of the various roles - which resulted in gold stars and stuffed animals at the end of each week			0
@entity9 has become a popular venue for political interviews - @entity173 and @entity138 appeared on the show last month			0
@entity215 : @entity10 and @entity39 have been married for more than four decades and have five sons and mr @entity31 had planned to boost his rapidly improving poll performance by sitting down with @entity10 to show off his human side in what would be his third appearance on @entity9			1
but on monday 's edition of the show , host @entity222 confirmed that the candidate had cancelled his appearance and had no plans to reschedule			2
she told viewers that the @entity4 's first couple had been invited partly to combat accusations of bias , saying : ' i think that there are some people who think that we favour the @entity236 , because they have been on the programme separately and together			0
' ms @entity222 continued : ' governor @entity31 was supposed to be on with us this thursday with @entity10			1
we were looking forward to it			0
' over the weekend , his people said that he had scheduling problems and would not be coming on with us			0
nor at this point did he feel that he could reschedule			0
' we are happy to have mrs @entity10 on with us			2
we are sorry that we wo n't have governor @entity31 and that 's the situation			2
' he can change his mind and we hope he does			0
it would be our pleasure to have him on the programme			0
' watch the video here unfortunately your browser does not support @entity252 .			0

when he was @entity17 governor he was pro-choice but is now running a pro-life campaign
@entity261 surrounded the visit as @entity39 *bailed* on joint appearance after saying that the hosts were ' sharp - tongued '
' women 's issues ' including reproductive rights becoming major issue
