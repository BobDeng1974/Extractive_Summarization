@entity3 - described as a ' little princess ' - was rushed to hospital from her home in @entity17 last month after she collapsed in front of her parents			1
the youngster died on arrival at @entity22 in @entity23 as a result of significant internal injuries , despite attempts by paramedics to save her			1
@entity3 's parents @entity29 , 22 , and @entity30 , 20 , were arrested on suspicion of murder , before being freed on bail pending further investigations			1
the couple have protested their innocence			0
detectives leading the investigation into @entity3 's death have now said their inquiry is being hampered by suggestions her injuries were caused by a playground fall , and insisted ' this most definitely was not an accident '			1
detective superintendent @entity46 , who is leading the investigation , said : ' there may well have been a fall from the swing but what i 'm saying , and what i 've been told , is the injuries did not arise as a result of that fall			2
' they were inflicted upon her by somebody using significant violence			1
the injuries are to her internal organs around her abdominal region			2
' he added : ' these are not injuries that cause instantaneous death but do cause death over a period of time			0
' @entity3 , said by her family to be a ' normal , healthy ' three - year - old girl , collapsed in front of her parents at 8am on august 30 and was rushed to hospital after they dialled 999 , where she later died			1
the couple were arrested and questioned for up to four days by police after tests showed @entity3 died as a result of ' significant internal injuries caused by violence '			1
' hampered ' : det supt @entity46 from @entity83 said the inquiry was being hampered by a belief in the community that @entity3 's death was a tragic accident they later went into hiding after getting death threats on @entity91			1
but they insisted they were innocent amid claims @entity3 may have injured herself whilst toddling around a children ’s playground the day before she died			1
at the time @entity29 posted a misspelt message on his @entity91 page saying : ' going off fb now as i said i aint descussed the case			0
dnt believe wt u hear cus it aint true			0
' a further post-mortem was due to take place on thursday at the request of lawyers acting for the pair			0
@entity46 said : ' our investigations have , to a degree , been hampered by the fact that many people in the community , many associates believe that @entity3 ’s death was due to a tragic accident and specifically that she had fallen off a swing in the day or so before her death and that this resulted in her death			2
' that is not the case - this most definitely was not an accident for cause of death , it was very much the fact that somebody has inflicted violence upon her and we need to identify who that person is			0
' appeal : @entity23 police are now urging people in @entity17 to come forward with information that may help them to solve the murder investigation the officer went on : ' as a result of @entity3 ’s death a post-mortem was undertaken by a home office pathologist and determined the cause of death was a result of significant violence that was inflicted upon @entity3 , and that this in turn had caused significant internal injuries to her , resulting in her death			1
” ' we have conducted a complex and thorough investigation into @entity3 ’s death and we ’ve spoken to many people about sightings of @entity3 , who @entity3 was with , and are particularly interested in looking at the two days prior to @entity3 ’s death			2
' i would like to know where she was , who she was with , what she looked like - anything that anybody can tell us about her			0
' the three - year - old spent time at a playground in @entity160 , @entity17 , with her father , her one - year - old sister , and another unidentified individual the day before she was rushed to hospital			1
the playground was at @entity160 , @entity17 , where she was playing the day before with her father and her one - year - old sister and another unindentified individual			2
earlier this month @entity3 ’s grandfather @entity167 , 47 , said the girl 's parents were staying at a hotel and ' just wanted to be left alone to grieve ' , but claimed they feared for their safety because they had received death threats online			1
' nothing is adding up at the moment , ' mr @entity167 said at the time			0
' why would @entity3 be running around in a park if she was feeling so ill ? there are so many things which do n’t make sense			0
' i only saw @entity3 two weeks ago at a family christening			0
she was a normal healthy three - year - old girl - a lovely girl so full of life			0
' it just seems so unreal at the moment and no - one can quite get their head around how this has happened			0
' the couple will answer bail in @entity17 on october 16			2
the family are understood to have been known to police and social services , but there was nothing of ' significant concern '			0
