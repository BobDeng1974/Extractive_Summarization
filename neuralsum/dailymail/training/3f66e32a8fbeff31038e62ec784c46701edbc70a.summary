by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor , @entity3 and @entity4 for @entity3 president @entity5 declared a mission - accomplished moment on thursday while promising that the @entity2 would continue to deliver airstrikes against the @entity9 terror group whenever it threatens @entity2 interests			1
he announced during a brief pre-golf speech that a @entity2 military operation had ' almost flawlessly ' helped tens of thousands of stranded @entity14 refugees reach safety following a harrowing week trapped on a remote mountainside			1
but ' we will continue airstrikes , ' he vowed , threatening @entity9 as it continues its rape - and - pillage approach to regime change			0
' we broke the [ @entity9 ] seige of @entity22			2
@entity23 , ' he said , referring to the self - declared @entity26 group 's reign of terror against the @entity28 religious minority group in @entity29			2
' we helped vulnerable people reach safety , and we helped save thousands of lives , ' @entity5 told reporters			0
@entity34 : a golf - weary @entity5 said @entity14 's @entity36 had escaped isis but promised the @entity2 would continue airstrikes against the terror group -- without putting boots on the ground the anti-punctual president : @entity5 kept the press waiting for a half - hour past his speech 's announced starting time before speaking for just a few minutes at a school in @entity45 , @entity46 on the run : displaced @entity36 waited for food and water on wednesday at the @entity14 - @entity51 border crossing in @entity53 province , even as they escaped @entity9 on @entity22			1
@entity23 there will be no more missions to help the @entity36 , he said , and ' the majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving @entity14 in the coming days			1
' he terms the mission an ' assessment ' because the role of military @entity62 was limited to little more than an aerial head - count			0
within hours of the deployment on wednesday , a flyover mission confirmed that only around 5,000 @entity14 refugees remained , out of an estimated 45,000 who had sought safety on @entity22			2
the @entity69 confirmed wednesday evening that most of the @entity36 refugees had already taken themselves out of harm 's way , in part because @entity75 fighters had cleared a path for them to leave safely			2
the @entity69 also credited its own military attacks on @entity9 targets , and humanitarian aid that helped sustain the people who were in harms ' way			1
@entity5 has been on vacation for the last six days , but the commander - in - chief looked more gray and haggard than ever as he delivered his update on @entity14 and a statement about violence in @entity88 , @entity89			0
he partied late into the evening yesterday at a birthday celebration for a longtime family friend , and danced to nearly every song , according to a @entity94 pool report			0
tired as he may be , the president was back out on links immediately after his public address to play his fourth round of golf since he arrived in @entity100 on saturday			0
he said in his remarks thursday that the @entity2 had ' conducted humanitarian airdrops every night ' since friday , ' delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water			0
' the military assessment on wednesday , he confirmed , ' found that food and water had been reaching those in need , and that thousands ... had evacuated each and every night			0
@entity5 declared victory over @entity9 in the siege of @entity22			1
@entity23 , but said more airstrikes will come yazidi refugees desperately grab juice drink cartons as they are thrown			0
a ten - day stand - off at the mountain by @entity9 appears to have been crushed after @entity2 bomb drops and a fightback by @entity75 forces allowed nearly 45,000 refugees to escape without a @entity2 escort rear admiral @entity123 , a @entity69 spokesman , said wednesday that ' there are far fewer yazidis on @entity22			1
@entity23 than previously feared , in part because of humanitarian air drops [ and ] air strikes on [ @entity9 ] targets			2
' the situation on the ground elsewhere in @entity14 , however , ' remains dire , ' said @entity5			2
he predicted that the @entity2 would continue to provide humanitarian aid in other regions of the beseiged country , ' without committing troops on the ground			1
' that pledge has raised eyebrows since @entity62 did in fact land on @entity22			0
the @entity94 has repeatedly framed ' boots on the ground ' scenarios as only those that include armed battles with the @entity26 's militants			0
@entity5 announced six days ago that he would authorize military airstrikes in northern @entity14 against the terror group 's forces who were threatening as many as 45,000 @entity36 , a religious minority group whose people fled to the remote @entity22			1
@entity23 â€“ and were left without food or water			0
following targeted airstrikes that launched just hours later , and after several days of humanitarian aid airlifts , @entity5 deployed 130 special forces personnel to the region on wednesday with an eye toward organizing an evacuation			1
@entity160 forces from the @entity161 also participated in the deployment , which began less than a day after defense secretary @entity163 told a group of more than 200 @entity165 at @entity166 that ' there will be no boots on the ground in @entity14			1

president said to expect more military strikes against @entity9 if they threaten @entity2 personnel
he *insisted* there would be no @entity2 ' troops on the ground ' despite deploying 130 special forces to @entity22 . @entity23 on *wednedsay*
' there will be no boots on the ground in @entity14 , ' defense secretary @entity163 promised a group of @entity165 on wednesday
@entity5 claimed victory as humanitarian aid sustained tens of thousands of @entity36 long enough to evacuate themselves without the @entity2 military 's help
