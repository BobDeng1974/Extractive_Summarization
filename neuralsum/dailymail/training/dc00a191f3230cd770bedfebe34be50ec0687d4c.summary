by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 19:19 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 03:39 est , 15 october 2013 @entity1 took a swipe at @entity4 ’s plans for visa reform yesterday – as the potential @entity7 leadership rivals went head to head in @entity10			1
the @entity12 mayor , whose aides are irritated by mr @entity4 ’s presence on the trip , suggested that an overhaul of @entity10 visas does not go far enough			1
in the first part of a week - long charm offensive , the chancellor announced plans to fast - track the visa system for wealthy @entity10 tourists and businessmen			1
mayor of london @entity1 ( right ) said @entity4 's ( left ) plans for @entity10 visa reforms is ' unclear ' but mr @entity1 , who has campaigned for a much more liberal regime , said : ‘ we will have to see how this scheme actually works			1
the detail is a little bit unclear to us at the moment			1
’ mr @entity1 yesterday went out of his way to steal the limelight from the chancellor , with a series of florid speeches and interviews			2
his bid to win over students at @entity39 misfired slightly when he joked that @entity41 ’s first kiss with @entity10 @entity43 pupil @entity42 illustrated the future for @entity10 and the @entity45			2
but critics pointed out that @entity42 is thought to have been @entity47 and the relationship quickly fizzled out			0
mr @entity1 insisted he and the chancellor were like ‘ a pair of harmonious doves ’			2
mr @entity4 , whose speech was received in near silence , replied they were like the ‘ yin and yang ’ of politics			2
but behind the scenes there is some resentment in the mayor ’s camp at the chancellor ’s decision to time his visit to @entity10 to coincide with mr @entity1 ’s			1
the two @entity65 are in @entity10 at the same time and mr @entity1 went out of his way to steal the limelight from the chancellor mr @entity1 insisted he and the chancellor ( pictured together at @entity39 ) were like a pair of ' harmonious doves ' , whereas mr @entity4 said they were the ' yin and yang ' of politics @entity10 banks will be able to apply to set up wholesale branches in the @entity75 under plans announced by @entity4			1
the chancellor described the move , agreed with @entity10 after two days of talks , as ' good for @entity45 jobs and investment '			2
the @entity82 will enter discussions with @entity10 banks in @entity12 which will allow them to apply to set up wholesale banks in the @entity45			2
@entity10 banks will not be able to open high street branches under the plans but will be able to conduct business with other banks and @entity91 agreement also contains plans to cement @entity12 's position as the global hub for trading in the @entity10 currency renminbi ( @entity97 ) by giving investors the chance to invest rmb directly into @entity10 through @entity12 under a pilot scheme			1
mr @entity4 said : ' a great nation like @entity10 should have a great global currency			1
' today we agreed the next big step in making @entity12 - already the global centre for finance - a major global centre for trading and now investing the @entity10 currency too			1
' more trade and more investment , means more business and more jobs for @entity113			0
' the mayor had hoped to be the first senior @entity113 politician to visit @entity10 following a recent thaw in relations , which had been in the deep freeze since @entity119 met the @entity120 last year			2
but mr @entity4 then announced he would visit @entity10 at the same time - a move which some in the @entity1 camp view as a ‘ spoiler ’			1
both men yesterday faced criticism for failing to raise @entity10 ’s abysmal human rights record with @entity129 officials			0
@entity130 described the pair ’s attitude to @entity10 ’s human rights record on their visits as ‘ disappointing ’			0
@entity135 , of @entity45 , said : ‘ we are very concerned about continued use of the death penalty in @entity10 , police torture and harassment of human rights and political activists and minority groups , and restrictions on freedom of expression			0
’ mr @entity4 said the purpose of the trip was to strengthen trade relations with the emerging economic superpower			0
he said @entity113 should show more respect for @entity10 and stop treating the country like a ‘ sweatshop on the @entity154 ’			0
he added that there was ‘ no limit on the amount of business we can do together			0
’ meanwhile , the mayor said it was not his role to challenge @entity10 on human rights adding : ‘ i do n’t walk into a meeting and say , “ i say , you chaps , how ’s freedom doing ? ” ’ ' i ’m not saying there is n’t a role for the @entity113 government to stand up for what is right in the world , or what the @entity113 government sees as being right			0
' all i ’m saying is it ’s not really my core function as @entity160 to go around aggrandising myself in that way and presuming to take on all the pomp and panoply of foreign secretary and international relations and all the rest of it			0
’ however mr @entity1 's attempt to sell @entity113 's relationship with @entity10 mis - fired with a @entity41 analogy which lacked magic			1
the @entity12 mayor is in @entity190 talking up closer links with @entity10 , claiming it was like the wizard 's first girlfriend ' @entity42 - who is a @entity10 overseas student at @entity43 '			1
but the latest attempt to upstage mr @entity4 quickly unravelled , with fans of the @entity197 series pointing out that @entity42 was @entity113 , and their relationship fell apart soon after starting			0
both men have been criticised for failing to raise @entity10 's poor human rights record during their trip highlighting @entity113 's close relationship with @entity10 , mr @entity1 drew on the literary works of @entity197			1
speaking at a q&a session at @entity39 , he said : ' if you want one final proof of how fast the world is changing , the cultural interpenetration between @entity113 and @entity10 , let me ask you a question , brilliant students of @entity39			1
' who in @entity214 literature is the most famous student ? who is the most famous student in contemporary @entity113 writing , would you say ? i will give you a clue - he sometimes has a wand ... @entity41			0
' he went on : ' where does the train go from which @entity41 has to catch to go to his school ? @entity227 , absolutely right , which is where ? @entity12			0
' where does @entity41 buy his uniform and his wand and stuff like that and his books ? i think it 's in @entity236 which is in @entity12			0
where is the location of the @entity239 ? @entity12			0
' and who according to @entity197 , the author of the @entity41 novels , was @entity41 's first girlfriend ? who is the first person he kisses ? that 's right , @entity42 - who is a @entity10 overseas student at @entity43			1
' ladies and gents i rest my case			0
i do n't think i need to argue any further , that is the future of @entity113 and of @entity12			0
' however , it was quickly noted that @entity42 was not described as a @entity10 overseas student in the series of novels , and was played in the films by @entity113 - @entity257 actress @entity256 with a @entity47 accent .			2

@entity1 suggested @entity4 's plans do not go far enough
told *reporters* : ' the detail is a little bit unclear to us at the moment '
