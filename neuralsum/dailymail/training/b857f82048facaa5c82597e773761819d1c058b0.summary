by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 winger @entity2 faces a two - week wait to find out whether the @entity5 will charge him after being accused of racially abusing @entity7 defender @entity6			1
@entity8 understands that @entity10 cameras did not pick up the alleged incident during saturday ’s 2 - 1 @entity13 win for the @entity15 champions at @entity16			0
the pair were direct opponents for much of the match and @entity20 @entity6 told referee @entity21 , his captain @entity22 and manager @entity23 that the @entity25 international called him a ‘ black c * * * ’			1
@entity6 has accused @entity2 of racial abuse during @entity3 's 2 - 1 win over @entity7 the @entity5 are likely to investigate the incident once they receive a report from the referee on monday @entity2 , who was making a belated debut for @entity3 after arriving on a one - year - loan deal from @entity34 in the summer , vehemently denied the claims when quizzed by his manager @entity36			1
on monday , the @entity5 confirmed it had received a formal complaint from @entity7 , as well as taking receipt of match reports from referee @entity21 and @entity43 delegate @entity42			2
the governing body has now started the process of investigating the issue			0
that should include speaking to both @entity2 and 26 - year - old @entity6 , as well as @entity3 boss @entity36 and @entity7 ’s @entity23			1
with @entity2 denying the allegation , a lack of conclusive evidence from @entity10 means it is a case of one man ’s word against another			2
it is alleged that @entity2 called the @entity7 defender a ' black c * * * ' during the game at @entity16 on monday night , @entity2 ’s agent @entity58 said : ‘ i want to emphasise that @entity2 is not racist			1
‘ as soon as i found out about the charge , i spoke with @entity60 and he categorically denied to me making the comments that have been alleged			0
‘ i want to add that his @entity20 is not so good , so i do not see how he could communicate normally and insult @entity6			0
‘ @entity2 and i are available to the disciplinary committee of the @entity5 at any time if they wish to receive more information			2
our only request is to resolve the case as quickly as possible to clear @entity2 ’s name			0
’ @entity75 are ‘ making enquiries into the circumstances ’ after learning about the incident via media reports			0

@entity6 alleges that @entity2 called him a ' black c * * * '
@entity3 *spokesman* says ' we have spoken to the player and he has stated that the accusation made is not true '
likely to be *difficult* to prove as it is only one man 's word against another
@entity5 likely to investigate after referee 's match report filed on monday
@entity2 could still travel to @entity82 clash in @entity80 on thursday
