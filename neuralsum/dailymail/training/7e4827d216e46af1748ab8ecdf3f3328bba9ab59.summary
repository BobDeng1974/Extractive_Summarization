@entity0 is already receiving requests to remove objectionable personal information from its search engine after @entity5 's top court ruled that people have the ' right to be forgotten ' , a source has revealed			1
the firm is yet to put a process to handle the expected flood of requests in place after tuesday 's ruling , said the source , who is not authorised to speak on the record about the issue			1
the decision by the @entity19 , which affects 500 million citizens , requires that search services remove information deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ' and failure to do so can result in fines			1
the decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services do n't comply , they face heavy fines			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on may 30 ' there 's many open questions , ' @entity0 executive chairman @entity32 said at the company 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in response to a question about the ruling and its implications on @entity0 's operations			1
under the @entity43 , @entity42 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			0
under @entity42 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			0
' this particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered illegally			1
the @entity66 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data			2
’ the @entity70 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove it			2
if a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			0
' a simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know			0
from @entity0 's perspective that 's a balance , ' @entity32 said			1
' @entity0 believes having looked at the decision , which is binding , that the balance that was struck was wrong			2
' he was not asked about the recent take - down requests			0
@entity93 has contacted @entity0 , but the firm has yet to reveal the number of take - down requests it has received			1
@entity0 will need to build up an ' army of removal experts ' in each of the 28 @entity66 countries , including those where @entity0 does not have operations , the source said			1
whether those staffers merely remove controversial links or actually judge the merits of individual take - down requests are among the many questions @entity0 is yet to decide , the source said			1
@entity5 citizens can submit take - down requests directly to @entity113 companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling			2
if a search engine elects not to remove the link , a person can seek redress from the courts			2
the criteria for determining which take - down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the decision , said @entity125 , a law professor at the @entity126 and head of the @entity128			2
the ruling was made by the @entity130 ( pictured )			0
it comes after a @entity133 man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy			0
@entity0 told @entity93 it is ' disappointed ' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index the ruling seems to give search engines more leeway to dismiss take - down requests for links to webpages about public figures , in which the information is deemed to be of public interest			1
but search engines may err on the side of caution and remove more links than necessary to avoid liability , said @entity125 , a long - time critic of such laws			0
he was asked by @entity0 to speak to reporters on tuesday 's ruling , but has no formal relationship with the company			1
search engines will also have to authenticate requests , he noted , to ensure that the person seeking a link 's removal is actually the one he or she claims to be			1
@entity0 is the dominant search engine in @entity5 , commanding about 93 percent of the market , according to @entity169 global statistics			2
@entity171 's @entity170 has 2.4 percent and @entity172 has 1.7 percent			0
@entity0 has some experience dealing with take - down requests in its @entity176 video website , which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights			1
@entity0 has automated much of the process with a @entity181 system that automatically scans uploaded videos for particular content that media companies have provided to @entity176			2
@entity0 may be able to create similar technology to address the @entity66 requirements , said @entity188 analyst @entity187			1
even if @entity0 does not automate the process , the extra cost of hiring staffers is likely to be insignificant to a company that generated roughly $ 60 billion in revenue last year , @entity187 said			2
if @entity0 were to pay staffers $ 15 an hour to process take - down requests , for example , the company could get a million hours of work for $ 15 million , he said			1
' it 's the cost of doing business for them			0
' @entity0 has said it is disappointed with the ruling , which it noted differed dramatically from a non-binding opinion by the @entity19 's court adviser last year			1
that opinion said deleting information from search results would interfere with freedom of expression			0
@entity172 is ' carefully reviewing ' the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users , a spokeswoman said in a statement			0
' since our founding almost 20 years ago , we 've supported an open and free internet ; not one shaded by censorship			0
' @entity171 declined to comment			0
@entity220 , founder of @entity221 , told @entity93 : ' the news that search engine operators will be subject to a @entity130 dictat on the right to be forgotten is ludicrous			0
' this ruling advocates nobody being responsible for their own actions			0
@entity231 to press censorship , it 's absolutely wrong that information that is of interest to the general public ought not to be in the public domain			0
you might as well say to a journalist who 's written up a story that they have no right to publish it			0
' the danger is that a public figure can behave as badly as they like , but with no consequences whatsoever , the story effectively becomes buried and forgotten about			0
' there are a minority of cases whereby an individual is associated with unsolicited negative attention due to factually incorrect information on @entity0 and other search engines , but cases such as these should not dictate the lay of the land for everyone			1
