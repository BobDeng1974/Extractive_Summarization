then last week she told @entity35 : ‘ i was horribly , horribly humiliated by @entity0 , who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me , and i did n’t like him because he smelled like my step - father and it frightened me and freaked me out , and i rebuffed him			2
’ it prompted @entity0 to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired , but his @entity44 application was rejected			0
allegations : the 69 - year - old funnyman was first named by @entity4 ( pictured ) when she spoke to the @entity6 's @entity33 reporters last year for a report which was never broadcast on friday , he invited reporters into his home in @entity50 , and told them the woman was ‘ a nutter ’ and accused her of ‘ picking my name out of a hat ’			2

‘ i have never been in any situation with @entity7 and @entity59 , and i have certainly never been with this woman			0
' i was horribly , horribly humiliated by @entity0 , who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me , and i did n’t like him because he smelled like my step - father and it frightened me and freaked me out , and i rebuffed him ' @entity4 ‘ she ’s claiming i made advances to her , it did n’t happen			1

presenter : @entity0 had denied ever meeting ms @entity4 - who claims he tried to molest her in sir @entity7 's ( pictured in 1982 ) @entity6 dressing room ' it would now appear from seeing footage of a @entity14 show aired in 1974 that in fact @entity0 was mistaken and therefore that he had in fact been on a @entity7 show			1
‘ however this does not detract away from the fact that @entity0 vigorously denies the awful allegation that has been made by @entity4 , which despite this footage is still totally unsupported and uncorroborated by any other evidence			2
