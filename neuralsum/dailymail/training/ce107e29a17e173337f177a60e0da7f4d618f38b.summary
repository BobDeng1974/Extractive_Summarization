a gay couple claim they were thrown out of a pub after they shared a kiss and were branded ' revolting ' by the landlord			1
@entity6 was celebrating his birthday with family and his boyfriend @entity9 at the @entity10 in @entity11 in @entity12 when they kissed			1
the couple , both law students , were then told they would have to leave the premises if they continued because the landlord said he did not like ' that sort of behaviour			1
' @entity9 ( left ) and boyfriend @entity6 claim they were told to leave a pub because they kissed but the landlord of the pub said he would take the same action against a female and male couple for kissing like that on his premises			1
mr @entity9 , 22 , said : ' the landlord said what we did was revolting			1
' all of @entity6 's family were there and they were really angry			1
it was a very stressful situation			2
' we are not happy at all with it			2
this is the first time something like this has happened to me - what we were doing should have been fine			2
all we did was share a kiss			2
' he said they had contacted @entity44 to complain about the incident and would not be returning to the pub. mr @entity9 added : ' we were really taken aback by the kind of language he was using			1
i said it the landlord of the @entity10 said asking the couple to leave had nothing to do with their sexuality was discriminatory and against the law , but he shouted to the barman to not serve us			1
' ' even the barman looked quite shocked			0
when we went elsewhere it was fine			0
' his partner mr @entity6 , 20 , posted a message on @entity64 after the incident , which saw several people condemning the heavy handed reaction of the pub. ' can not believe that i was kicked out of my family pub for kissing my boyfriend			1
absolutely disgraceful , ' he wrote			0
mr @entity6 ( left ) branded the incident ' disgraceful ' however landlord of the @entity74 , @entity75 , denied that the incident had anything to do with the couple 's sexual orientation and said he would do exactly the same if it happened again			1
he said : ' i have been a landlord for 30 years and have never seen behaviour like it			1
' there was a complaint from one of my customers			0
so i said to them , ' if you want to do that again , do it outside			0
' ' but i did not throw them out			0
i just told them to go outside if they wanted to act in that manner			1
then they started causing all kinds of problems			0
' it would be the same if it was a man and a woman kissing like that			2
i have nothing against gay people - half of my darts team here are lesbians			0
' i do n't do social media so i have n't seen what people are saying			0
but i would definitely do the same again			0
' behaviour like that in a pub is unacceptable			2
it was out of order			0
i am trying to run a public house and i ca n't have things like that going on			0
