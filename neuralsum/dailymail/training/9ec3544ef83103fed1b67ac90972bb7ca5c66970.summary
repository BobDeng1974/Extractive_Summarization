an extremely enthusiastic seven - year - old made an unforgettable tv debut last week when he was given the chance to deliver his local weather forecast – and hilariously stole the show from the station ’s veteran weatherman			1
appearing alongside @entity10 ’s @entity9 ’s resident meteorologist @entity8 , charismatic second - grader @entity7 offered a unique take on the day ’s weather report , bringing a bit of sunshine to an otherwise dreary forecast with his impressive repertoire of jazz hands and dance moves			1
@entity7 , who clearly has a bright future in front of the camera , began the segment by revealing that it was his first time on television			0
but the budding weatherman showed no sign of nerves as he continued on with the @entity28 , the station ’s special weekly segment which sees a different local child deliver the weather each week			1
' i want to be a police officer ... because i love danger ! ' he said			0
' but i also want to be a millionaire			0
' ' and i kind of want to be a soccer player , like i am right now , ' he added , spinning around to show off the @entity49 jersey he was wearing			0
high - energy performance : @entity7 showed off some impressive dance moves during the three - minute segment arms in the air : @entity7 cheered as he announced that sunshine was coming over the weekend @entity7 then demonstrated dance moves he learned from @entity58 , as well as some he made up himself			2
unsurprisingly , the youngster claimed to be very popular at his school , @entity10 's @entity60			2
finally , mr @entity8 let him deliver the weather by himself and his big personality completely overshadowed the forecast			2
unpleasant news : he also booed and made a crying gesture when he revealed that temperatures would drop aiming high : @entity7 hopes to be a police officer , millionaire and soccer player when he grows up gesturing wildly , he cheered as he told viewers that sunshine was on its way and boo - ed as he announced the arrival of lower temperatures			0
@entity7 ’s forecast was clearly a hit with mr @entity8 ’s colleagues – as well as station viewers – with news anchor @entity79 sarcastically joking : ' i wish he 'd come out of his shell			1

second - grader @entity7 was *invited* to join @entity10 's @entity9 weatherman @entity8 and help deliver the day ’s forecast
@entity7 's guest appearance was part of the station ’s regular ' friday forecaster ' segment which *features* a different local child every week
