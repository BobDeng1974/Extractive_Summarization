by @entity1 reporter published : 14:05 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 16 august 2013 it seemed like a fool - proof plan : lie back and pretend you ’re dead while your friends carry you through the streets , demanding compensation for your brutal murder			1
and it might have worked for one crafty @entity11 street vendor – only he had not counted on the effects of an unusually intense heat wave			1
indeed , the heat was so unbearable the unidentified worker appeared to miraculously rise from the dead – and promptly demand a drink of water			1
it started when a crowd of outraged ‘ mourners ’ carried a seemingly lifeless body on a makeshift gurney through the streets of the city			1
among them were witnesses claiming he had been beaten to death by despised ‘ urban management workers ’			0
the body was covered with a sheet , but the witnesses insisted there was a badly beaten body underneath			0
run - ins between street vendors and authorities are commonplace			0
several cases of conflicts ending in a vendor ’s death have outraged the nation			2
urban management agents – or ‘ chengguan ’ , as they are known – are responsible for dealing with sanitation complaints , unlicensed construction and illegal peddling			0
the body was covered with a sheet , but witnesses insisted there was a badly beaten body underneath critics say their methods are heavy handed – confiscating goods and doling out stiff fines and stiffer beatings			0
with this backdrop , it ’s easy to see why a crowd soon formed around the body – whipped into a frenzy as much by the injustice as by the insane heat of the day			2
scores of people were soon surrounding the body , some with their shirts off and others trying to catch a bit of shade underneath umbrellas			0
the core group of demonstrators – the witnesses who had been there when the chengguan ' murder ' took place - were demanding tens of thousands of yuan in compensation			1
as his friends ' demands fell into a sheepish silence , the newly revived chengguan victim was given a bottle of water and allowed to go on his way but , just when their demands were reaching fever pitch , the body under the sheet started twitching			1
dramatically , the corpse suddenly flung off his shroud , sat bolt upright and begged the crowd to quench his thirst			0
as his friends ’ demands fell into a sheepish silence , the newly revived chengguan victim was given a bottle of water and allowed to go on his way			2
it is unclear whether the local authorities intend to prosecute the man and his friends for their apparent scam , but there is no doubt that some @entity35 residents will forever check for signs of life when presented with a dead body .			2

@entity11 vendor was carried through the streets pretending to be dead
his friends demanded compensation for his ' brutal murder '
but the intense heat caused him to *sit* upright and ask for a drink of water
