small print buried in the @entity6 revealed the @entity7 will not relaunch @entity9 - linked certificates until april 2014 at the earliest			1
the popular tax - free deals are a lifeline for savers , especially the elderly who need to protect their fixed incomes from price rises			1
savers will continue to be hammered by the rising cost of living after it emerged the government will not offer inflation - busting accounts for at least a year some 900,000 thrifty households already have £ 25billion stored in these accounts , which pay interest matching inflation – currently 2.8 per cent – plus as much as 1.35 per cent on top			1
however , they have not been available to new customers since september 2011			0
the decision not to reintroduce them for another year means millions of savers will lose out			1
currently , no ordinary bank or building society account ’s interest rates can beat the rate of inflation – meaning savers ’ earnings will be outstripped by the rising cost of living			1
basic - rate tax - payers need a savings account paying 3.5 per cent to beat tax and inflation , while a higher - rate earner needs 4.67 per cent			1
however , analysis by the website @entity40 found that the average rate paid on an easy - access savings account is just 0.77 per cent			1
only a handful of cash isas pay inflation - beating returns – but to benefit you need to be prepared to tie your money up for years , or have a huge lump sum to simply qualify			1
@entity49 , @entity40 ’s director , said : ‘ what ’s happening is an absolute travesty for savers , and it ’s only set to get worse			2
‘ those who have done the right thing for the future by saving have been hammered hard – and now there is even less incentive for future generations to save			0
’ @entity59 pulls in public money through a mix of savings deals , including index - linked certificates , and premium bonds			1
small print buried in @entity66 's @entity6 revealed the @entity7 will not relaunch @entity9 - linked certificates until april 2014 at the earliest it is backed by the @entity7 , so customers ’ cash is guaranteed to be safe , even if savings exceed £ 100,000			1
however , the government can raise funds more cheaply on the money markets , and so has little incentive to offer juicy index - linked deals			1
attempts to kick - start the economy have also hurt savers			1
the government ’s £ 80billion funding for lending scheme has pumped cheap credit into banks , and so they too do not need to offer tempting rates to attract savers ’ money			2
the low base rate has also hit savers , causing them to miss out on more than £ 100billion of interest since the @entity89 cut it to 0.5 per cent in march 2009			2
to make matters worse , changes to the way the @entity89 works could effectively guarantee that interest rates will stay low for years even if inflation stays high			0
@entity96 , a former @entity97 adviser on savings , warned : ‘ savers simply can not beat inflation – and will clearly continue to lose out			2
‘ the inflation forecast has been revised upwards , while the chancellor made it clear that he expects interest rates to stay very low for a long time			0
’ director of the @entity106 @entity105 income tax receipts are to soar by a third thanks to an army of workers dragged into the higher rate tax bracket			2
the amount raised through income tax will rise from £ 150.5billion this year to £ 198.9billion in 2017/18			2
part of the increase is down to higher wages , according to the @entity117			0
but the vast increase in the number of workers forced to pay the higher rate of tax will also have an effect			2
more than five million are expected to be in the 40p tax bracket by the next election in 2015 – two million more than at the 2010 election			0
‘ the higher rate is no longer something faced only by the highly paid few , ’ said @entity105 , director of the @entity106			0
@entity129 , an accountant at @entity130 , said : ‘ we ’re getting to a point where well over 60 per cent of all the income tax receipts we receive are going to be from higher rate taxpayers			0
‘ some of that is going to be from those at the very top , but some will also be from the huge numbers of people who are being dragged in to paying higher rate tax			0
’ the point at which workers start paying the 40p rate of tax has been kept artificially low by the government as part of its policy of increasing the amount anyone can earn before paying tax to £ 10,000			0
the increase in the so - called personal allowance from £ 6,475 in 2010 to £ 10,000 in 2014 means 2.7million people will have been lifted out of paying income tax altogether			1
workers will pay 20p in tax for every pound they earn above £ 10,000			0
but the @entity106 said the point at which the 40p band kicks in will be nearly £ 5,000 lower than it would have been in april 2014 if the @entity146 had let the threshold rise with inflation			0
@entity106 analyst @entity162 said raising the threshold to where it would have been without government intervention would cost the @entity7 £ 4.5billion in 2014/15 alone			0
@entity167 , senior tax partner at @entity169 , said the chancellor deserved ‘ full marks ’ for raising the personal allowance to £ 10,000			0
he added : ‘ a raspberry however for continued erosion of the basic rate tax band			0

the popular tax free deals are a lifeline for savers especially the elderly
