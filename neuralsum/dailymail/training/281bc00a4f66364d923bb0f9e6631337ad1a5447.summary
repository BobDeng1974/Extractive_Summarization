confident : @entity1 finance minister @entity0 said he expects @entity2 to drop its opposition @entity5 finance ministers failed once again today to agree on a sweeping new policy to fight tax evasion because of resistance from @entity2 - a tiny country that long has prospered from a secretive banking culture			1
@entity5 taxation commissioner @entity10 said their failure was disappointing because , if approved , the legislation proposing an @entity5 - wide automatic exchange of data on bank deposits would allow governments to identify and chase up tax evaders			1
@entity2 , a duchy of barely 500,000 people , was able to shelve the legislation for the 28 - nation bloc and its 500 million citizens because the decision required unanimous approval at today 's meeting in @entity26			1
@entity2 finance minister @entity27 said he could not vote in favour and pushed the decision to a summit of @entity5 government leaders next week			1
@entity2 has insisted for years it would support the proposed law only if non-eu banking hubs within @entity34 , particularly @entity35 , also sign up			1
but as the @entity5 's negotiations with @entity35 , @entity37 and three other nations on signing the agreement have made progress , @entity2 has responded with new reasons for opposition , chiefly the risk that banks outside @entity34 would draw deposits away if the continent 's banking rules are tightened too much			1
@entity1 finance minister @entity0 said he was confident that @entity2 would drop its opposition at next week 's summit			1
' we 've been working on this for such a long time , whether we agree today or in four weeks , that does n't kill me either , ' he said			2
@entity5 officials say tax fraud and companies ' aggressive cross-border tax avoidance schemes cost the bloc 's governments an estimated 1 trillion euros ( £ 830billion ) a year - money needed in an age of sluggish growth and high debt across @entity34			2
@entity65 finance minister @entity64 ( pictured left in december ) said progress had been made in drawing up proposals to protect taxpayers from future bank bailouts the finance ministers did achieve some progress today			2
they drafted compromise proposals designed to break a deadlock between @entity5 governments and the @entity75 on how to set up an agency that could restructure or shut down failing banks , the @entity5 's so - called ' single resolution mechanism '			2
the agency is intended to help stabilise the financial system and reduce the risk that taxpayers would have to fund future bank bailouts			0
@entity65 finance minister @entity64 said the new proposals sought to address lawmakers ' criticisms			0
he and other finance ministers declined to provide details			0
the proposals are to be presented at negotiations with lawmakers tomorrow in @entity90 , @entity91			0
to avoid significant delays in setting up the agency , an agreement between the @entity5 's governments and @entity75 leaders must be reached by the end of march			0
that would leave time for the legislation to be voted on before the @entity75 dissolves for may elections			0
lawmakers have complained that the @entity5 's original proposals gave national governments and regulators too much influence over the rescue authority 's decisions , leaving room to play politics and give advantage to their domestic banks			1
the new bank - rescue fund would be financed by a levy on banks that would raise 55 billion euros ( £ 45billion ) over 10 years by 2026			0
however before the fund would be tapped , a failing bank 's creditors , including holders of large deposits , would be forced to take losses .			0

@entity2 able to shelve proposal as decision need to be unanimous
country *feared* non-eu banking hubs such as @entity35 would gain an *unfair* advantage
