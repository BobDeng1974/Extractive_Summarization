training officer @entity45 said : ' @entity46 are training in the area so they were on the hill and we also had @entity50 and @entity51 on the scene really quickly and that was followed by a rescue helicopter			1
' there was actually a separate avalanche in the area before we got the call out for the later one with three people			2
two people involved in that walked away completely unscathed so they were lucky			0
' the later one involved three men who were carried about 150m over rocks but they were wearing helmets and , from accounts of the rescue personnel on the hill , that probably saved them and they got away with leg injuries , although one of them may have a particularly serious lower leg injury			1
' i saw one of the helmets of one of the guys who was rescued and it 's got quite deep scratches along the side			2
it was only the three men involved and at no point were they under the snow they were pushed along on the surface			2
' a spokesman for the @entity19 , who sent a rescue helicopter from @entity87 , said clear weather allowed the @entity90 aircraft to reach the area safely			1
he said : ' the crew has been called to this point many times and know it intimately			0
the weather was exceptionally clear and posed no problem for access to the casualties			0
' the only consideration was moderate turbulence which required the aircrew to apply full margin of power			0
the three casualties were taken to hospital ; two were walking wounded , the third had unfortunately broken both ankles			0
airlift : the three climbers were taken to @entity33 in @entity34			1
rescue teams said they escaped life - threatening injuries because they were all wearing safety helmets ( file picture ) ' on board the @entity90 was also an @entity115 doctor taking part in scheduled familiarisation flying who was able to administer pain - killing relief to the casualty			1
' recent weather in the @entity11 had raised the avalanche risk to ' considerable '			1
meanwhile , a 57 - year - old man was also rescued by helicopter after falling on @entity125 in the southern @entity126			0
the hill walker managed to contact @entity128 at around 4.20pm and a @entity130 rescue helicopter from @entity131 was sent to the scene			0

mr @entity45 added : ' recently we 've had a lot of wind and there 's been a fair bit of fresh snow so there 's been a bit blowing around			0
' the avalanche information service forecast a considerable risk of avalanche above 900m , pretty much from east through to south west facing slopes and both of the avalanches today happened around east facing areas at altitude			2
