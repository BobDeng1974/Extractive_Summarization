she describes a cheeseburger advert that features an almost naked woman , writing : ' when so many females fight for gender equality in pay and opportunity – still to this day in 2015 – an advertisement like that only sets women back generations			2
' ' women , ' she pontificates , ' can be comfortable in their own skin ... be the woman with a voice , not the sex - ed up body without one			1
' regaling her own life story , @entity0 tells readers : ' even at 18 , and yes as a model once , i never fathomed resting on appearance alone			1
' in a @entity94 era , i was more worried about putting my nose in a book rather than flaunting it ( and other female assets ) in a portfolio book			0
' if a @entity100 ad helped pay for my student loans , great			0
but , i wanted to be an attractive and intelligent woman			0
' she closes with a rallying cry against the cheeseburger ad that inspired her diatribe : ' put the burger down during the big game 's party and pick up some chips and salsa			2
it will be my silent act of solidarity			0
' it seems her activism waned as she came face - to - face with mother - of - three @entity30 at the @entity119 after her car was removed from the parking lot of a @entity123 restaurant in @entity59 , @entity60			1
the verbal attack on april 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office			1
' i ’m in the news , sweetheart , i will f --- -- g sue this place , ' @entity0 can he heard saying in the video			1
the parking attendant can be heard in the video warning @entity0 she is being filmed and threatens to ' play your video '			1
@entity0 seems unfussed , responding : ' that ’s why i have a degree and you do n't - i would n't work in a scumbag place like this			1
' makes my skin crawl even being here			2
' the parking attendant patiently replies : ' @entity145 lets get you out of here quickly			0
' @entity0 then fires back : ' yep , that 's all you care about - taking people 's money … with no education , no skill set			1
@entity154 wanted to clarify that			0
' after a few more comments , including telling the woman she does n't have a brain , @entity0 delivers her biggest sting			2
' maybe if i was missing some teeth they would hire me , huh ? ' she says			0
' cos i 'm on television and you 're in a f --- -- g trailer , honey			0
' finally , before walking away , @entity0 says : ' lose some weight , baby girl			1
' caught red - faced : incredibly , @entity0 was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant , however continued to insult the woman 's looks , education and job on - camera unhappy customer : @entity0 leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras she 's outta there : @entity1 immediately responded by suspending @entity0 , but only for one week the towing company told @entity185 ' she was in the wrong ' but insists there are no hard feelings towards @entity0			1
in a statement emailed to @entity192 , a spokesman said : ' parking enforcement is contentious by nature			0
' at the same time , neither @entity30 , our lot clerk , nor our company , have any interest in seeing @entity0 suspended or terminated as a result of her comments			1
' ms @entity201 is our neighbor , and , as she said , to paraphrase , made remarks that were out of line			0
she is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment			0
' @entity30 is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family			1
@entity30 holds no ill will toward ms @entity201			2
' as a small business , we saw no benefit to releasing the video , except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing , public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter			2
the video was not licensed or sold to anyone			0
' there is now a petition to have @entity0 fired from her role in @entity226 , slamming the sportscaster as ' derogatory , classist and body - shaming			1
' the @entity230 petition reads : ' currently @entity0 is serving a mere 1 - week suspension for her outburst			2
' by retaining @entity0 as a prominent public figure of @entity235 , @entity1 and other networks effectively send a loud public message condoning this type of cruel behavior			1
' the comments captured in the video represent an unacceptable attitude of hatred for lower - income @entity244 and individuals whose features do not match traditional beauty standards			2
' @entity0 lost her credibility as a professional journalist when she shamelessly broadcasted this hatred both to the victim in the video and to a global audience of thousands who now bear witness to it			2
' continuing to support @entity0 directly threatens not only her potential future victims , but also the integrity of @entity1 , the field of @entity244 sports media , and journalism as a whole			1
as the video , obtained by @entity267 , spread online , @entity1 , which is owned by @entity265 , was forced to react			1

as frustrated as i was , i should always choose to be respectful and take the high road			0
i am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake			0
' however , her apology has done little to quell the tirade of fury , and the following day weight discrimination groups began speaking out against @entity0			2
' it was extremely sad , ' @entity315 , vice president of marketing and communications for the @entity316 , told the @entity318			0
