for most couples , the idea of shared interests in a middle - aged relationship are trips to the garden centre , a meal in the local pub or maybe a visit to the cinema			2
for @entity10 , 58 , a retired @entity11 and @entity12 , 42 , a hairdresser and beautician from @entity14 in @entity15 , their idea of a shared hobby is having affairs with other people			1
the couple , who have been together for the last 17 years , are both signed up to different marital affair dating websites and have relationships with several men and women , while all the while sharing a home and a life together			1
the couple even share their bed with their dates			2
the couple were completely open with each other from the start , taking each other ’s profile pictures and recommending what to say in their information section			2
since then , they have surfed each site together on a daily basis , commenting on the different men or women available			1
@entity10 told @entity55 : ‘ we go through each other 's websites on the laptop together about once a day because we do n't hide anything			1
‘ occasionally @entity12 says no to a man and i ’ll ask why not , just because i 'm curious about what 's alright with a but not @entity64 ‘ but we do n't vet			1
@entity12 is free to choose what she likes and i 'm free to choose what i like			1
’ @entity12 is signed up to the website @entity38 from that moment on though , the way that they communicate on their individual websites is personal			1
in four years , they have both had several successes with the opposite sex			2
@entity10 has met up with roughly 15 women , with some extending to romances that last several months , others have been one night stands and a few have amounted to nothing at all			1
he said : ‘ it all boils down to chemistry when you meet			2
things have gone further with five or six people for me over the years			2
‘ i 've probably met about 15 over the last four years but obviously do n't seen them all long term - my longest friendship has gone on for seven months			1
‘ it 's fairly regular , maybe once a month that you go and meet someone , or every two weeks maybe			0
’ @entity12 has had a similar success rate with the men she has met , although she has continued to have a relationship with around six of them for roughly the last two years			1
she said : ‘ there ’s about five or six that i see on a permanent basis and one that i see every ten days or so			0
‘ the others i see when they can get off work , so about every couple of weeks and one of them about every four weeks			2
‘ they 've all be around for about two years			1
’ @entity12 and @entity10 on holiday as a young couple in 2001 the couple have certain ground rules in place , like contacting the other if they are going to go home with a person for the first time , but they do n’t tend to discuss the more intimate areas of each meet - up			1
@entity10 said : ‘ i do n't need to know what 's going on - @entity12 does n't ask me the intimate details and i do n't ask her the intimate details			1
‘ but if she 's going to meet someone or i am , the other one always knows who or where and if a first date turns into an “ i 'm going home with them , ” we always text the other person to let them know - it 's a safety factor			0
’ it is n’t just a safety factor though , the strict rules about openness are also in place so that the trust between them never breaks down			0
@entity10 said : ‘ there 's one absolute golden rule - no cheating			1
‘ i had a wife that cheated on me and in my opinion , what breaks up the relationship is n't that you cheated but that you lied to me			0
i ca n't trust you then			0
‘ but at the end of the day , sex is sex			0
if you 're not lying to me and hiding things behind my back then you 're not breaking down the essential part of being a couple , which is the trust between you			2
’ @entity12 says that she likes to meet up with men who share her interest in visiting museums @entity10 and @entity12 are so unfazed about the fact that each other are having intimate relationships with other members of the opposite sex , that they are n’t even bothered if one brings a date home to use their marital bed if the other is away from home			1
@entity10 said : ‘ if @entity12 's not at home then the woman i ’m with can come back to the house , or most of the time that @entity12 is there , we go back to the woman ’s house , or we book into a hotel			1
‘ we 're both happy with that			0
the same applies to @entity12 as well , if she knows i 'm not at home			1
‘ and we only have one bedroom , so we 'd use that			0
‘ the way we both see it is , if you 're in this particular lifestyle then there is n't that same sanctity about the bedroom and the bed that @entity181 and b have when they 're married to each other and do n't sleep with anyone else			0
' that removes the need to worry about , “ who was in my bed last night ? ” or , “ whose bed was he in last night if he did n't come home ? ” ’ the couple are also open to the other one bringing a date home if they are interested in having sex with both of them			2
@entity10 said : ‘ there is flexibility in that rule			2
‘ occasionally things develop into threesomes , so if that 's where you seem to be heading with your internet talk , then obviously the fact that the other one is at home does n't make any difference			0
‘ that has happened to both of us when we ’ve been on dates			0
‘ there 's a lot more people into threesomes , foursomes or wife - swapping than you might think			0
‘ we ’re open to threesomes or foursomes			0
‘ threesomes we do n't mind either way - we can have two women and me or we can have two men and @entity12 , we 've done both			1
’ @entity10 enjoys walks in the countryside , so often meets up with women who share this interest but although @entity12 and @entity10 clearly sleep with the women and men that they are dating , it is in no way just about sex			1
they share common interests and hobbies with the people they meet up with and their dates often revolve around these			0
@entity12 said : ‘ i go for men with the same interests as me			1
‘ the difference between me and @entity10 is i like going to museums and things , whereas if @entity10 's been and seen them once , he does n't like going back and seeing them again			2
‘ i 'm one of these people who goes back a lot - i go to the science museum as often as i can get up there			0
‘ the man who i see every ten days , he works in central @entity254 , so we go out there and go to the @entity257 museum and things like that , more cultural things			2
’ @entity10 meanwhile , is attracted to women who enjoy watching sport and who like the countryside , but also trips to the local cinema			1
he said : ‘ one woman who used to meet once every fortnight - we went out to things like the cinema , theatre and for meals			0
‘ it was convenient because in that instance , her husband went away for a week every other week on business , so she had that time to do other things			0
‘ her husband did n't know as far as i was aware			0
’ @entity12 and @entity10 often surf the dating sites together ( picture posed by models ) he continued : ‘ i find that i look for someone with interests that @entity12 does n't have , like certain sports , because @entity12 and i only have one sport in common - rugby union			1
‘ she also is n't interested in wandering in the countryside just because it 's there , whereas i 'm quite happy to drive to the middle of the countryside and just walk for miles			0
‘ i also go for women with a smaller dress size to @entity12 , i mean she 's not fat , do n't get me wrong , she 's a size 16			1
‘ but i 'll look for a 12 or 14 , different colour hair and length of hair			0
‘ just so i 've got something different to what i have at home , because otherwise you might as well be at home			2
‘ if they do n't look different or have a different interests , what is the point of being there			0
’ while this arrangement might seem strange for some , @entity12 and @entity10 are perfectly happy with it and both state that they do n’t have feelings of jealousy when the other is out on a date			1
@entity10 said : ‘ it 's not that i do n’t love @entity12 , we have just found that it does improve our relationship - it makes you much more open with each other			1
‘ you 're much more honest about the things you like and do n't like and what you 're doing			0
you do n't keep secrets			0
‘ one day , when it stops working for one or the other , we wo n't do it anymore			0
‘ we always said no matter what happens , you ca n't end up splitting up because of it			0
