@entity0 is hoping his form for @entity2 will help him maintain his place in the @entity5 squad following @entity7 heartbreak			1
the midfielder was left out by @entity9 last summer as his national side fell at the semi-final stage against eventual champions @entity12 on home turf			1
but @entity0 has been selected in every squad since , as returning boss @entity16 continues his shake - up in an attempt to return @entity5 to their former standing in the world game			1
@entity0 ( left ) is hoping to hold down a regular place in the @entity5 squad the @entity2 midfielder was omitted from the 23 - man @entity7 squad last summer the 22 - year - old has appeared from the bench four times in the seven games since , but was an unused substitute as @entity5 beat @entity31 3 - 1 in @entity32 on thursday night			1
' whenever i 'm called up , it 's like the first time , ' @entity0 told an @entity37 documentary			1
' it 's a great honour to wear the @entity40 shirt , which thousands of people dream of wearing one day			2
i want to honour it whenever i have the opportunity			2
it means a lot to me			0
' i believe being in the team is a dream for every player			0
you can represent your country			0
it is a very young squad , so just by having a chance it 's a special moment for me			2
' my goal is to look for my own space			0
i believe that is everybody 's goal			0
i know we have other great players , players who have had a great impact on the team			0
i 'm looking for my chance slowly			0
' @entity0 ( left ) in action for @entity5 against @entity66 in @entity67 last november after coming on as a substitute @entity16 has selected @entity0 in every single one of his @entity5 squads since he took over last summer @entity0 ( right ) has been in excellent form for @entity2 in the past few months @entity0 had won just a single cap heading into last summer 's @entity7 , but his form for @entity2 as they finished second in the @entity73 gave him an outside hope of a call - up			1
but @entity9 elected to omit him , meaning @entity0 missed the once - in - a - lifetime chance of playing in a home @entity7			1
' i know that was the only opportunity i had to play at the @entity7 in my country , ' he continued			1
' whether i should have been called up is a bit complicated to say			0
i 'd rather think about the present and make things happen in the future			0
' i wo n't have that opportunity again , so i should use it all on the field , doing what i 'm demanded to do in my position , what a midfielder must do , to be on the list for the next @entity7			2
