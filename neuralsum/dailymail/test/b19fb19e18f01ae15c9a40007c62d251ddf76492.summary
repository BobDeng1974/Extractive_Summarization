last week , a handful of @entity2 tech fanatics took delivery of the first highly sought - after @entity4 watches			1

and while these smartwatches might sound as if they ’re just for tech - savvy geeks , whether you ’re a fitness fanatic , want to track your sleep and calorie intake or simply like the idea of checking your emails on your wrist , there ’s a watch that could make your life easier			1
best for beginners pebble watch , from £ 99 , getpebble.com the @entity25 was one of the earliest smartwatches , and since it launched in 2013 , more than a million have been sold			1
it ’s easy to see why			1
it keeps things basic — there are no buttons or whizzy features and you ca n’t make calls or browse the internet ( you have a phone and computer for that )			1
instead , once connected wirelessly to your phone , you can see who is calling , texting or emailing , without having to get your phone out — though you will need your phone to reply			1
the battery charge lasts longer than other smartwatches — up to seven days — partly because it uses a low - energy screen ( similar to a @entity47 ) that is readable in daylight )			1
best for easy reading @entity52 , £ 67.95 , @entity53 if you do n’t want to squint to see the screen , this smartwatch is the one for you			2
it has a mammoth 2.4 in face , making it about twice the size of most smartwatch screens and roughly half the size of an @entity63 screen			2
this high - resolution option does n’t just make reading messages easier , it also means you get a full keyboard , which makes typing easier , too			2
the device pops out of its strap so you can take advantage of the two cameras			2
there ’s one on the back and , for video calls or selfies , there ’s a front - facing camera			2
with @entity86 , pedometer and compass , it can also track your activity and calories burned			2
best for retro fans @entity92 , £ 319.99 , selfridges.com designed in @entity94 and made in @entity95 , this claims to combine cutting - edge technology with traditional @entity98 styling			0
with ticking hands protected by a scratch - proof glass and a @entity103 fine calf leather strap , it looks every inch an elegant , conventional timepiece			0
but underneath , clever sensors track your sleep patterns and monitor every step you take , communicating wirelessly with your phone			0
wear it at night and it can act as the most discreet of alarm clocks via a silent vibration alert			0
best for fitness fanatics @entity119 , £ 169 , @entity53 marketed as the ‘ ultimate fitness and sleep tracker ’ , the @entity120 incorporates what you ’d expect of a fitness watch — water resistance , up to four days battery charge life and a movement sensor — but it has much more besides			1

it can log sleep duration and quality , and communicates wirelessly with your mobile so you can see a full breakdown of how many calories you ’ve burned			0
it adjusts weekly goals based on your performance			0
best phone - free solution @entity145 , £ 329 , samsung.com this is the watch that is so smart you can ditch your phone			1
it comes with a slot for a sim card so it does n’t need to piggy - back off another device and — like the @entity4 watch — has a choice of straps and a face that can be customised			1
bluetooth connectivity means you can hook it up to a wireless headset with a microphone and make a phone call without having to shout into your wrist			0
you can listen to music — with @entity170 of memory , there ’s space for 1,000 songs			0
it also lets you browse maps and websites and the 2 in curved screen even has space for a tiny keyboard , though you can use voice commands instead			0
best for familiarity @entity183 , £ 165 , kairoswatches.com many of us have watches that are treasured family heirlooms or expensive gifts that we do n’t want to jettison just because new technology has rendered them obsolete			0
this clever invention means you can have the best of both worlds			0
rather than being a smartwatch , it ’s a smartstrap that can be ordered to fit almost any watch			1
it looks like a simple black band when it ’s switched off , but when it ’s activated , the led panels embedded in it light up to display notifications , such as heart rate , alerts of incoming calls and messages .			0
