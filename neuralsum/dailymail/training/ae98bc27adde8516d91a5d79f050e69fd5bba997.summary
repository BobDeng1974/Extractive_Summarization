@entity1 matches will be played on friday nights from summer 2016 under the next tv deal but the @entity4 can reveal that another more radical proposal — league games played overseas — will not happen for the foreseeable future			1
fan power has seen the idea shelved , perhaps for good			0
the @entity1 ’s chief executive @entity10 wants overseas games to happen , following the lead of the most lucrative sports league in the world , the @entity15			1
most of the @entity1 ’s clubs , led by the major foreign - owned sides , want them to happen			1
meaningful games in foreign host cities could earn tens of millions per match			2
but home - based supporters ’ opposition seems to have kiboshed the notion			0
@entity1 stars such as @entity27 ( above ) are set to be a hit around the world the @entity1 ’s chief executive @entity10 ( centre ) wants overseas games to happen @entity31 , november 's @entity1 player of the month , could now be scoring goals on a friday ‘ the clubs are keen for us to keep developing the concept but we ’re no nearer , ’ said @entity10 , who first proposed in 2008 that a ‘ 39th game ’ be played abroad each year , in an exclusive interview			1
‘ the idea of an extra game is gone			0
whether you play a regular season game ( overseas ) , that has challenges , not least among the fans , which we take into consideration			0
‘ i ’ve never shied away from the fact that personally i think it ’s a good idea			0
i bear the scars from thinking it ’s a good idea			0
a lot of the clubs think it ’s a good idea ... but there is absolutely no time line and no idea when it might happen			0
’ asked to confirm that an overseas game will not happen foreseeably , in the next tv round and before 2020 at the earliest , @entity10 said : ‘ you can make that assumption			0
’ @entity60 have the rights to 116 games this season , and that number could go up with the new deal the @entity1 tender document for @entity68 live tv rights for 2016 - 19 is just dropping on the desks of senior executives at major broadcasters			1
the @entity1 will sell 168 live games per season to @entity68 television from 2016 - 17 to 2018 - 2019 , up from 154 games now			1
those games will be sold in seven packages , five of 28 games and two of 14 per year , and about 10 games per season will be on friday nights			1
no buyer will be allowed more than 126 games per season			1
the @entity1 currently make £ 3.018billion from @entity60 and @entity83 for domestic live rights for 2013 - 16 and about £ 2.9bn more combined from foreign live rights ( £ 2.2bn ) , highlights , near - live rights and mobile clip rights			1
these massive sums flow to the clubs , who in turn spend it buying and paying big - name players , most of them foreign , and therefore attractive to global audiences			0
so a ‘ virtuous circle ’ of growth continues			0
@entity99 caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £ 6.5m per game in 2013 the @entity1 will soon boast the second biggest annual income from broadcast rights in the world , according to a report from industry specialists @entity107			1
the @entity109 top flight currently sits in third place , behind the figures for @entity112 and baseball in the @entity114			0
but the next tv deal could soar to £ 7.5bn between 2016 - 19 , an annual income of £ 2.5bn , which would take the @entity1 second			1
and 38 per cent of the @entity1 ’s broadcast income is from overseas , already the highest ratio by far in the world			1
1 @entity15 £ 4.14billion ( american football income from broadcast rights in 2014 ) 2 @entity123 £ 1.94billion ( @entity114 baseball ) 3 @entity1 £ 1.91billion ( domestic and overseas income ) 4 @entity126 £ 1.21billion ( @entity114 basketball ) 5 @entity128 6 @entity129 7 olympics 8 @entity131 9 @entity132 ( @entity133 ) 10 @entity134 ( @entity135 ) analysts and insiders have contrasting views of how much these deals could grow but everyone agrees they will grow			1
it would be no surprise to see the total three - year pot soar from £ 5.9bn to £ 7.5bn , and if major new players such as @entity147 - owned @entity146 come to the table for the @entity68 rights , as long suggested , it could yet be more			1
the @entity1 ’s global appeal is being highlighted this weekend at ‘ @entity151 ’ , a huge public event in @entity153 , @entity154 , where 20,000 fans from the sub-continent are gathering in a public park , essentially to watch @entity1 matches on a big screen			1
yesterday they watched @entity159 play @entity160 on one screen and @entity163 host @entity162 on another			0
today they will be treated to @entity164 against @entity165			0
there is also a tented village where fans can be photographed with the @entity1 trophy , visit exhibitions by the @entity1 ’s clubs and meet a range of ‘ legends ’ including former @entity164 goalkeeper @entity174 and former @entity165 striker @entity175			1
@entity176 , a 30 - year - old manager with an online company , has made a two - hour flight from his home town in south - east @entity154 specifically to attend @entity151 this weekend			1
‘ i ’ve been following the @entity1 for 10 years , since @entity185 ’s invincibles , ’ he said , although he is a @entity164 fan , through admiration of sir @entity182 ’s management and teams			1
he and college mates , variously fans of @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity185 and @entity159 , watched whatever games they could as students in their communal digs , and remain hard - core fans today			1
@entity191 has also soared again in the past year , he says , because the coverage within @entity154 has improved , with more games and higher broadcasting standards			2
the @entity15 has made lucrative sums of money by staging a host of games at @entity199 @entity200 scores a touchdown for the @entity202 49s against @entity203 in @entity204 that can be explained by @entity207 ’s investment			0
the rights holders on the sub-continent paid £ 93m for their current three - year rights , up from £ 29m previously			1
they have also invested in new commentators , some of them trained in @entity109 by veterans including @entity60 ’s @entity215 , and now offer games in multiple languages			1
‘ football is an aspirational sport and @entity154 has a committed fan following for the @entity1 , ’ said @entity207 ’s chief operating officer , @entity218			2
‘ @entity151 is a great initiative to take fans closer to the game , its iconic clubs and legendary heroes			0
’ @entity174 , in @entity153 to help promote the event , said interest in the @entity1 in @entity154 is ‘ massive ’			2
he has also travelled extensively as a @entity164 ambassador and adds : ‘ every time i go somewhere i ’m still genuinely taken aback at how big @entity164 are			0
’ champions @entity162 are set for @entity1 games on a friday night under a new rights package yesterday he went to the @entity163 tent at @entity151 to have a @entity236 chat with his son @entity237 , @entity163 ’s goalkeeper , back home			1
‘ i was surprised to see how many people were in there , the interest here is in the @entity1 as a whole , not just one club , ’ @entity239 said			2
‘ there are people in @entity159 shirts , and @entity164 , @entity165 , but also @entity163 and other clubs			0
’ @entity10 sees @entity154 as one of eight key ‘ strategic ’ international markets where the rights values can soar in the 2016 - 19 sales round			1
the @entity114 and @entity254 are also in that bracket			0
‘ the size of the market , the potential growth in the market and also the appetite of local partners to develop that market — when you get those three things coming together , that ’s what determines it , ’ he explained			0
he knows that the @entity1 is most likely to see a surge in tv income in any market , domestic or foreign , where two or more rival broadcasters both desperately want the rights			2
@entity159 fans sing during the @entity1 ' @entity151 ' event in @entity153 , @entity154 ‘ growth tends to be driven , historically , by competitive tension , ’ he said			2
‘ where there is competitive tension our rights grow and where there is n’t any they tend not to grow			0
therefore it ’s difficult to forecast			0
but do i see headroom ? yes			0
do i see growth ? yes			0
@entity287 of industry specialists @entity107 , said : ‘ the @entity1 ’s international rights value is the envy of sports properties around the world , including the biggest @entity114 leagues such as the @entity15 , @entity123 , and @entity126			2
‘ there is still room for growth in @entity1 international rights values			2
crucially , it is popular in many regions with growing pay - television industries , such as in @entity301 , the @entity154 subcontinent , and @entity303			2
pay - television has been the big driver of sports rights values around the world			2
it is also benefiting from the rise of football in the @entity114 — football rights fees have been growing strongly there in recent years			0
