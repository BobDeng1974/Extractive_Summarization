fans mobbed @entity10 and his @entity3 team mates as they arrived into @entity12 and @entity7 ’s @entity13 reported an accident was prevented following one fan ’s decision to switch escalator ’s to get close to the players			1
@entity7 state media @entity19 has also revealed that the @entity3 squad skipped a trip to @entity1 ’s famous @entity22 due to security worries			1
the @entity4 squad was also greeted by huge crowds as they arrived into @entity1 but surprisingly it ’s not @entity29 the @entity7 fans were most excited for but his more experienced team mate @entity26			1
the 32 year old with three @entity50 appearances to his name returns to the @entity4 set up following an 18 month exile			0

he is the perfect professional football player in our eyes			0

@entity10 is the most popular player in @entity7 and was mobbed by fans as he arrived at the airport @entity57 is building on a new era for @entity4 after a humiliating exit at the @entity50 last summer @entity26 loses out in the @entity7 social media stakes though where he has only 0.71 million followers on social networking site @entity113 in comparison to @entity10 with nearly 20 million on rival site @entity115			1
saturday ’s game is a friendly but that ’s hardly the appropriate word for this rivalry			0

@entity57 replaced @entity154 ’s @entity153 with uncapped @entity156 midfielder @entity155 while @entity158 goalkeeper @entity157 was also added late due to a finger injury to @entity160			0
following the clash @entity4 will face @entity162 in @entity163 on the october 14 while @entity3 face @entity164 the same day			2
while games like this are not often treated seriously abroad , @entity7 fans are not lacking in commitment as the game approaches			2
@entity26 poses with @entity172 defender @entity171 ahead of the @entity4 squad 's arrival in @entity1 the returning @entity4 star trains but there are fears about pollution in the @entity7 capital this week student @entity180 of @entity181 traveled 460km from @entity182 to @entity1 not just for the game itself but for glimpses of her idols			1
‘ i am a big @entity4 fan , i do n’t want to miss this opportunity to see them , ’ says @entity180			0
‘ in the last three days i went to the airport three times and saw the team train every day			0
i got the autographs of five players including my hero @entity195			0
this will be one of the best memories of my life			0
’ despite the excitement over their arrival and anticipation of the game , something far beyond @entity7 fans ' control may have a big effect on the game - pollution			2
the @entity71 team trained on friday but are spending as much time as possible in their hotel before the game @entity1 has had a tough few years with the issue and since wednesday , levels have been labeled ‘ hazardous ’ with masks recommended , hardly ideal for a professional football match			0
conditions have apparently kept @entity4 inside their hotel , aside from a brief training session , but despite the threat @entity7 fans remain upbeat			1
@entity7 social media users have suggested that @entity10 should wear a mask when he plays so they still get to see the @entity223 turn out ; fingers are crossed for the pollution to clear for saturday ’s clash .			1

@entity7 fans in a *frenzy* over @entity4 vs @entity3 clash
@entity10 for @entity3 and @entity26 for @entity4 the biggest draws
@entity26 has not featured for @entity4 in 18 months but more popular than @entity30 star @entity29 in @entity1
pollution fears have put match in jeopardy , @entity10 could play in a mask
