by @entity0 ' could n't be bothered to pay ' : @entity1 claims that he jumped the barriers to avoid paying the train fare from @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity6 multimillionaire comedian @entity1 has made a fresh bid to bolster his revolutionary image ... by boasting that he dodged a train fare			1
the comedian has admitted jumping the barrier on a journey from @entity4 to @entity5 in @entity6 , saving him from a £ 14.90 hit to his estimated £ 15million fortune			1
he claimed that he did n't make the effort to pull out his credit card at the ticket office because he ' could n't be bothered with the rigmarole of getting one '			0
brand has come under fire for his vocal espousal of revolutionary socialist politics while enjoying a luxury lifestyle including stays at the @entity24 in @entity4 and the purchase of a sumptuous home in the @entity27			2
he claims that his vast wealth has not changed him			0
the @entity29 quoted the 38 - year - old as saying : ' from someone that 's gone from no wealth to wealth , i know that money does n't make me happier			0
like i jumped the train yesterday when i had to go to @entity5			0
' i could have got a ticket but i could n't be bothered with the rigmarole of getting of getting one			0
' i realised all i had to do was get over a barrier so i did that and then slid out the other end behind someone			0
' @entity1 's self - alleged act of civil disobedience is just the latest in a line of anti-establishment arguments and claims he has spouted in recent months			1
but commentators say the comedian 's professed enthusiasm for revolutionary anarchism and the overthrow of the capitalist economic system is a poor fit for his own money making schemes			2
the @entity60 's @entity59 revealed last november how @entity1 - who has called for an end to ' massive economic disparity ' - has been trying to court ' high - net - worth ' investors into stumping up cash for a new film , with the company behind the scheme highlighting the potential 60 per cent tax breaks for those getting involved			1
' why vote ? we know it 's not going to make any difference ' : brand 's political activism has led to charges of hypocrisy , given that he enjoys a luxury lifestyle including a mansion in @entity81 and stays at the @entity24 in the @entity82 , @entity1 is the director of three separate entertainment companies , @entity83 , the colourfully titled @entity85 ’s @entity84 , and another called one @entity86			1
@entity87 turned over more than £ 1.5million last year , making close to £ 800,000 for its shareholders			0
latest accounts for the latter two firms , meanwhile , show they turned over more than £ 370,000 last year , which means @entity1 ’s @entity82 businesses alone grossed close to £ 2million			2
meanwhile , the wannabe movie mogul , who still commands fees of around £ 5million for acting roles in @entity81 , has been settling in to a five - bedroom mansion in @entity81 that was once owned by @entity97 and , from its commanding hillside position , boasts stunning views of the twinkling lights of @entity101 arrayed below			1
and when he returns to @entity82 to foment revolution , he has been often seen staying at the @entity103 on the @entity104 , that well - known doss house and hotbed of anti-establishment sentiment close to @entity108			1
not so @entity109 : @entity1 supported the @entity110 in @entity4 from @entity111 to the @entity112			2
@entity4 , @entity82 on @entity113 last november despite such apparent hypocrisies , @entity1 remains a darling of the @entity118 and an icon to the young , many of whom feel disenfranchised by the homogeneity of political views expressed by the @entity112 political machine and identify with the comedian 's call for drastic political change			1
a poll by the @entity127 ' own @entity128 found that four in 10 people feel so alienated by politicians that they might not bother voting - with many giving reasons that resonated with @entity1 's own argument that he has never voted because he regards politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant			1
last november , @entity1 told the @entity137 's flagship @entity135 political programme : ' i 'm angry , because for me its real			2
this is what i come from ... there is going to be a revolution			0
' do n't bother voting			0

' a spokesman for @entity150 , which runs the @entity4 to @entity5 route , declined to comment on @entity1 's claim , but said : ' we take fare evasion very seriously as it is in the interest of everyone who travels			1

@entity1 's self - alleged fare evasion saved him £ 14.90
the multimillionaire comedian lives in a five - bedroom @entity81 mansion
when in @entity4 he stays at the @entity103 on the @entity104
