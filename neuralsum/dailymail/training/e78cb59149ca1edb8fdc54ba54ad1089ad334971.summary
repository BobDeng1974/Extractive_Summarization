they claimed @entity107 was rarely as good in the second half of the season as he was in the first			0
well , the way he has been playing in the first half of this campaign is better than most players manage over the course of four or five seasons ! the @entity109 statement stuck in my mind and it certainly will have stayed with @entity107			0
the challenge for him now is to continue his sensational run of performances			0
@entity107 runs off with his arms wide in celebration after scoring against @entity135 in september the @entity137 midfielder 's passing and assists have been crucial to @entity0 so far this season the stats show @entity109 might have had a point , as his performances do tend to tail off in the second half of the season			2
but now he has a manager who will be all over him if he does n’t perform			0
the way @entity0 are going , though , it ’s hard to see him doing anything other than play well			0
expect him to be pulling the strings tonight			0
@entity107 celebrates after scoring for @entity0 against @entity153 against @entity153 in december the @entity0 midfielder ( left ) is held back by @entity156 's @entity155 on saturday @entity36 's @entity157 the next few months will feel a bit like an open - top bus parade for @entity36 as he gets ready to bid farewell to @entity7 , but i ’m sure he will want to make a quick detour to @entity164			1
this is a fantastic opportunity for @entity2 to win a trophy and it ’s poignant that tonight ’s game is against @entity0 , a team that so nearly plucked @entity36 from @entity7			2
he could have left and won many more trophies , but he stayed true to his boyhood club and they will be desperate for him to win one more before he leaves			0
@entity36 is starting a farewell tour from @entity7 after announcing he will leave in the summer @entity36 plays a pass during @entity2 's match against @entity175 in october the @entity2 captain slides in celebration after scoring in september 's @entity179 derby against @entity180 back to basics @entity8 is a coach who believes strongly in his own attacking philosophy			2
he sticks to his principles , sometimes to the detriment of the team			0
if @entity8 persists with his preferred back three , @entity0 ’s wide men will tear them apart a conventional back four would increase their solidity , so it will be interesting to see how @entity8 goes			2
@entity8 has a strong attacking philosophy but he must sacrifice some of his principles against @entity0 @entity190 has been asked to operate in a back three recently but @entity8 should move to a back four now we 'll see what mourinho has learned after losing 5 - 3 to @entity193 at @entity194 , i felt we would only see what @entity9 made of that defeat the next time he faced a big team on the road			1
that ’s no disrespect to @entity156 , but @entity9 played his best team on saturday			0
he has a tendency to be more cautious against the top sides away from home			0
the @entity193 defeat will have created doubt in his mind and it might be that he puts another holding midfielder alongside @entity210 on tuesday night			0
@entity0 's players look distraught during the 5 - 3 defeat against @entity193 on @entity213 @entity214 runs off in celebration after netting @entity193 ' fifth goal against @entity0 at @entity194 @entity9 gestures in frustration during the difficult defeat and he may revert to two defensive midfielders			2

@entity2 host @entity0 in @entity5 semi-final on tuesday night
@entity9 has a good record against @entity2 historically
there *'ve* been some classic cup ties between sides and this could be too
@entity107 must ensure he impacts on the game for the @entity234
@entity8 should revert to four at the back against @entity0
