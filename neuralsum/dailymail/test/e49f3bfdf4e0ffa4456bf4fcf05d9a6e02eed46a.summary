@entity0 basked in the gratitude of his team - mates after kicking @entity3 into the semi-finals of the @entity5 in dramatic scenes in north @entity7			1
@entity0 , striking the ball into a strong wind , landed a 55 - metre penalty in the final act of the last eight showdown against @entity13 to snatch a 12 - 11 victory at the @entity15			1
it completed a scarcely believable win given @entity3 had been battered for most of the match only to display remarkable tenacity and set up a semi-final appointment with @entity21 in @entity22 in two weeks			1
@entity0 kicks the winning penalty as @entity3 beat @entity13 12 - 11 @entity0 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring the kick that won his team the game @entity3 director of rugby @entity27 admitted he was surprised to see @entity0 taking the penalty ' with kicks like this you 're either the hero of the day or the bad guy , so i 'm happy that it went my way			1
i just stayed relaxed and fortunately it went through the posts , ' @entity0 , 31 , said			1
' sometimes they ask me if i 'm keen to take the long - range kicks and because of the wind it was not a good distance for the other kickers			2
i said ' why not ? i can take it ' and the rest is history			0
' the last time i did a kick like that was when i was 21 and playing for an amateur club in @entity52			0
it was from more or less the same range against our classico rivals			0
' it was a great memory for me , but it was a long time ago			0
i tried to be as relaxed as possible because we had the wind in our face and i did n't want to force it			0
' it was the last minute of the game so i was tired and tried not to think about what it represented			0
' @entity0 also executed a try - saving tackle on racing wing @entity67 when all his @entity52 team - mate had to do was fall over the line for a potentially decisive final - quarter try			1
' @entity67 is a real player			0
he 's like a striker - always smelling the goal			1
i followed him and fortunately stopped him from scoring at the end , ' @entity0 said			2
until @entity77 delivered the knockout blow - referee @entity76 awarded the penalty with 10 seconds left on the clock - a full blooded quarter - final that was often a poor spectacle appeared to be destined for a home win			1
@entity3 fly - half @entity82 kicked one penalty and full - back @entity85 supplied six points to keep the match favourites in sight			1
two second - half penalties from scrum - half @entity90 , who also crossed for the game 's solitary try in the 27th minute , placed @entity13 in control that the @entity95 only relinquished as @entity76 was preparing to blow for full time			1
' i was surprised to see it was @entity77 taking it because i though it was in @entity85 's range , ' @entity3 director of rugby @entity27 said			1
' but the wind was very strong , so it was @entity77 's range			2
he had the nerve and balls to say he wanted it , which is half the battle			0
he hit it pretty sweetly			0
' @entity0 is pretty cool			2
he 's pretty laid back , but like anybody , that 's one of those kicks that if you miss it can cause the damage			2
' i 'm very grateful that he held his nerve			0
he also made the tackle on our goalline that kept us in the match as well			0
@entity118 ( left ) of @entity3 is tackled by @entity67 of @entity13 in the quarter - final clash @entity85 ( centre ) of @entity3 sprints with the ball as @entity123 ( right ) approaches ' we were n't great in the first half even though we had a very strong wind behind us			1
but that 's where it turned around and i 'd say our second half performance was as courageous , brave and hard working as i 've seen			2
' we went hunting and kept knocking them down and scrapped for absolutely everything			0
' @entity13 's @entity135 centre @entity123 was distraught at the outcome			1
' i 'm hugely frustrated and gutted for the team			0
we thought we had it in the bag			0
that last minute cost us so fair play to @entity0 with the kick at the end , ' @entity123 said .			2

@entity0 secured a 12 - 11 win for @entity3 against @entity13
@entity3 *struggled* for most of the @entity5 quarter - final
but @entity0 's huge penalty *conversion* saw them make the semi-final
