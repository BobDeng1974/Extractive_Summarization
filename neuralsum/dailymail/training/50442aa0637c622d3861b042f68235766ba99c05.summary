by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 05:00 est , 10 december 2012 the first ever ‘ dance fusion ’ week on @entity1 has turned everything topsy - turvy			2
@entity4 , who ’s been stuck in a dancing rut for ages and nearly got booted off , not only topped the leaderboard but scored the only 40 of the series so far			1
then @entity9 , who has been the stand - out dancer and the one to beat , ended up in the dance - off			1
@entity12 , what drama ! after all that excitement i think i need to lie down in a darkened room and be fanned by a ( shirtless ) @entity16			0
earning the perfect score for a routine is @entity1 ’s ultimate accolade and one that only a handful of the celebrity dancers ever manage to achieve			0
but on saturday night @entity4 – or ‘ @entity22 ’ as she ’s been nicknamed on the show – joined their ranks following her half cha - cha - cha , half tango routine			1
cha - cha - stars : @entity4 and partner @entity29 danced their way to a 40 it was enough to earn a standing ovation from @entity33 and cries of ‘ the dance of the series ’ from a highly excitable @entity37			1
and it ’s not just fancy footwork that our @entity4 had down pat – whether she ’s fired up for the tango or letting it all hang out in the salsa , the girl pouts better than a toddler on the naughty step			2
dance fusion , stolen from @entity48 – the @entity50 version of @entity1 – is a new , and somewhat baffling , concept that seemed to have left audience , presenters and dancers alike in a state of complete confusion			2
competing couples had to blend two different dances into one routine using just one piece of music			0
@entity4 's routine was met with a standing ovation from @entity33 while @entity37 labelled it ' the dance of the series ' taking it to the max : judges @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity33 and @entity37 why do this instead of just performing two separate dances is anybody ’s guess , but as it appears to have , thankfully , replaced the god - awful swing - a - thon then i ’m not complaining			1
@entity9 , the contestant who consistently puts in the most hours of training , kicked things off with her jive and quickstep routine which @entity69 dismissed as ‘ a bit boring ’			2
boring ? @entity9 with her partner @entity84 ended up in the dance - off her score of 35 left her in fourth place ( out of six ) on the leader board and in last night ’s dance - off with @entity90			1
thanks to the judges , @entity9 was saved and @entity90 left the show , but if it had been solely down to the public vote then i ’m not sure she would have survived			1
the question of whether @entity9 ’s experience in musical theatre gives her an unfair advantage has never gone away and there ’s a strong feeling on many of the @entity1 online forums that she should n’t be in the final in a fortnight ’s time			0
conspiracy theorists were given plenty of food for thought last week , when it was mysteriously announced that producers were changing the rules this year to have four , instead of the usual three , couples in the final			0
is it all a ploy to get @entity9 to the final ? or maybe @entity118 , who , good as she is , is not quite up to the standard of the others ? who knows			0
but , surely , more people dancing on a dance show can only be a good thing ? while @entity9 suffered a setback , dinky @entity126 gets better every week and finished second to @entity128 with her quickstep and @entity131 mix. it helped that she at least got two dances that vaguely went together , unlike poor @entity90 , who had to cobble together a samba and an @entity50 smooth			1
following his brilliant performance in the @entity131 in the previous show , @entity136 kept up the high standard with his tango and rumba fusion			0
@entity142 revealed that winning the @entity1 trophy would mean a great deal to him , since he has won only silver and bronze medals as an @entity147			0
i ’m guessing he has n’t seen the trophy , otherwise he ’d know it ’s just a disco glitterball glued to an old shoe box .			0
