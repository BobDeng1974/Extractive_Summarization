' unacceptable ' : chair of the public accounts committee @entity2 said : ' every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child ' millions of pounds of @entity9 aid money could be lost to crooks and fraudsters because of ' unacceptably poor ' controls on corruption , mps warn today			1
the commons public accounts committee warns the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) needs to impose ' much tougher ' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector			1
mps said they had heard evidence that millions of pounds was spent on projects with links to known fraudsters			1
they highlighted a £ 20 million investment in a power plant project in @entity25 , in which one company had alleged links to the notorious fraudster @entity28 , the former @entity29 cashier who was jailed for 13 years in 2012 for a £ 50 million fraud			1
mps also raised concerns about a £ 20 million investment in a gas plant in @entity34 , involving a company allegedly involved in ' looting @entity34 oil revenues '			1
the @entity9 is the biggest donor to the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) - which was set up to invest in infrastructure projects in developing countries - with total support expected to reach £ 860 million by 2017			2
today 's report says the @entity38 was beset by ' poor financial management ' , lavish travel spending , and doubts about the integrity of its investments			2
committee chairman @entity2 said : ' it is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that @entity15 is able to demonstrate that @entity9 taxpayers ' money is being used for its intended purpose - of helping the world 's poorest people - and not ending up in the wrong hands			1
' every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child , improving health systems or supporting economic development			0
' we recognise that @entity38 operates in countries where standards of governance can be challenging			0
however the department 's oversight of @entity38 has been unacceptably poor and has left it open to questions about the integrity of @entity38 's investments and some of the companies with which it works			2
' a @entity15 spokesman rejected the claims , saying there was ' absolutely no evidence ' of wrongdoing linked to the companies involved in either the @entity25 or @entity34 projects			1
' @entity9 's investment in the @entity38 has helped to create 200,000 jobs and driven £ 6.8billion of private investment into some of the world 's poorest countries , developing their economies and making them less dependent on aid , ' the spokesman said			1
investment : the commons public accounts committee warns the @entity15 ( pictured , file photo ) needs to impose ' much tougher ' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector warning : committee chairman @entity2 ( pictured ) said : ' it is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that @entity15 is able to demonstrate that @entity9 taxpayers ' money is being used for its intended purpose ' we already have strong oversight of @entity38 's activities and have recently clamped down on excessive travel rates			1
an independent review of their operations , backed by @entity9 , will ensure they continue to kick start growth in the developing world			0
' but critics said the report highlighted the folly of the government 's controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of @entity9 's income on aid , which has been blamed for rushed spending			2
@entity119 , chief executive of the @entity120 , said : ' another day , another tale of international aid being handed out without proper checks or oversight			0
it is becoming a familiar story and shows how ludicrous it is to put an arbitrary 0.7 per cent target on the statute book			0
the department must improve its handling of taxpayers ' money and ensure that not a penny sent abroad is wasted or lost in the system			0
' @entity137 last night said it had ' grave concerns ' about the way money was being spent with the private sector			0
shadow international development secretary @entity142 said : ' there 's nothing wrong with working with the private sector			0
these are funds set up by a @entity137 government			0
my question is when you scale them up this quick without changes to governance and oversight ( there is ) concern about where and how the money is spent			0
