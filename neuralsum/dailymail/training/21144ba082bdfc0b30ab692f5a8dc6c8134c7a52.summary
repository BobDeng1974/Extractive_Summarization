a young woman who was told she might not see her 30th birthday if she did n't slim down has lost an incredible 20st – nearly two thirds of her body weight – and dropped 10 dress sizes			1
at just 27 @entity5 weighed 32st 11lb and wore a dress size 34			1
it was at a routine health check that her gp warned her that if she did n't tackle her weight she could be less than 18 months away from a heart attack			1
now , after losing 20st 5lb , @entity5 has started a new job she loves , has just set up home with her boyfriend and been named @entity16 2014			1
' i was a very unhappy girl – i would walk everywhere with my head down looking at the ground and i hated looking in the mirror			1
now when i smile my whole face smiles , and i walk everywhere with my head held high			1
i feel like i 've got a second chance at life and i 'm looking forward to everything the future holds			2
' @entity5 , from @entity33 in @entity34 , wore a dress size 20 at just 15 and had to have her clothes specially made			2
as she got older she avoided social situations and used food as an emotional comfort			2
she says : ' like most big kids i was picked on at school , i put up my defences so no one would ever know they 'd hurt my feelings but when i got home i 'd cry			2
not much changed as i got older			2
at 27 you should be out living your life , but i did n't want to be seen by anyone so i 'd just stay home and read a book or watch television			2
' @entity52 used to use junk food as a comfort , becoming increasingly isolated due to her size she tried to shed the weight by attending slimming clubs and even visiting a hospital dietician : ' i felt the diets i followed were always too restrictive for me			1
i was hungry a lot of the time and i could n't fit them into my life because they did n't let me have any treats			2
' my experience at the dieticians was even worse , they said their scales could n't weigh me and i had to sit in something called ' the obesity chair ' – it was mortifying			2
it 's experiences like that that crush your self - confidence bit by bit			2
' as @entity5 's weight increased she began to worry about her health as heart problems run in her family			0
in october 2011 she visited her doctor and received the grim diagnosis			0
just days later , she was dealt another blow when the bath at her family home cracked beneath her heavy weight			0
she says : ' hearing something like that from the doctor scares the living daylights out of you			0
a few days later i was taking a shower as usual when i heard a noise and realised the bath had cracked			0
i could n't believe it			0
' i did n't want to have to come out and tell my parents i 'd broken the bath , i wanted that bath to swallow me up			0
both of these things were wake - up calls and i knew i really had to do something			0
within days i was at my first @entity103			0
' @entity5 had heard about @entity103 from a friend , @entity104 , and joined her at the local @entity105 , run by @entity106			1
@entity5 says : ' i felt sick and was absolutely petrified because i felt i had such a long journey ahead of me			0
i did n't need to worry though – @entity108 came running over to offer me a cup of tea and everyone was so friendly			0
' now i sail into the group , they 're like my second family and i tell people that there 's no reason to ever feel scared because everyone – no matter how much weight they 've got to lose – is there for the same reason			1
' i think i get as excited when other members lose weight as when i do , it 's amazing to think we 're all helping each other as well as ourselves			0
' she began following @entity18 's @entity130 eating plan and started enjoying more regular meals			1
gone were the super-size bags of crisps and jumbo bars of chocolate and she took over the cooking at home , whipping up healthy recipes like turkey stir - fry for her parents , sister and nephew			0
she lost 11lb in her first week and 4st 7lb in just three months			1
@entity52 has now swapped staying in for nights out on the dance floor with friends and loves shopping as she slimmed down @entity148 , who suffered from painful knees and legs as a result of her size , began walking more			1
she says : ' before i would struggle to walk even 500m so i could n't do too much to start with			0
i began by walking between one lamppost and another and building up slowly			0
now i can walk three miles a day and i 'm hoping to take up @entity156 and start shaking my hips a bit			0
' @entity5 's recently reached her target weight , dropping from 32st 11lb to 12st 6lb , and was named @entity160 2014 at a ceremony in @entity162 on saturday november 8			1
what she 's lost in weight , she 's gained in confidence ; she successfully applied for a job with an online training company , discovered a love of shopping and has swapped staying in for nights out on the dance floor with friends			1
it was on a night out in summer 2013 that she met fellow @entity18 member @entity174 , who has lost 5st himself , and the pair soon became a couple			1
they have recently moved in together and are planning a future			1
@entity5 says : ' i honestly believe that if it was n't for my @entity18 group i would n't be alive today , i would be six - foot under and my parents would be visiting my grave			1
' my doctor is over the moon and so am i. ' i 've always loved reading but now instead of burying myself in a book all the time , i feel like i 'm finally starring in my own fairy tale			0
these past three years have been the best years of my life and i ca n't wait for everything that 's still to come			0
