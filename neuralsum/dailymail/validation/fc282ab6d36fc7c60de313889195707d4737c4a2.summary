' three days into the holiday , taken at the end of july , 2012 , ms @entity0 became sick , suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea			1
she explained : ' as soon as we got there i wanted a shower , but when i went in and turned on the water , the smell was horrific , it smelt like a cesspit in there			1
' that continued for the whole holiday ; the staff poured disinfectant down , but all that did was make the smell in the whole room unbearable			2
' there were flies all around the restaurant , birds flying around and leaving droppings , and the toilets in the hotel were absolutely filthy , full of mould and dirt			2

@entity90 , a solicitor and international personal injury lawyer at @entity92 who represented the holidaymakers , said : ' we received dozens of complaints from holidaymakers who stayed at the @entity98 during 2012 and in seeking to secure them justice for their illnesses and ruined holidays we were able to obtain expert evidence which was supportive to their claims , despite the refusal by @entity24 to neither admit or deny liability			2
' there were guests that were diagnosed with @entity88 food poisoning and @entity89 , and a number of the guests that suffered illness suffered from symptoms including stomach cramps , diarrhoea , vomiting and lethargy ; these illnesses have had a debilitating long term impact on the health of some of our clients			2
the @entity9 , which has now changed its name to the @entity12 , in @entity13 , where 32 children fell ill back in 2012 ' we understand that @entity24 no longer advertises this resort on their website but our clients were unfortunate enough to go there and have terrible experiences as a result			1
' many guests had to seek medical assistance whilst abroad and upon returning home , and they are now understandably relieved to have received compensation for the pain and suffering that they have gone through , re-imbursement of their financial losses and expenses and damages for their ruined holidays			0
' despite @entity24 's initial unwillingness to engage constructively with us to resolve these claims , we are delighted that our clients continued to instruct us to fight for them and that we have been able to negotiate a fair financial settlement for them			0

during their stay at the hotel the family were struck with stomach cramps , sickness , diarrhoea and a fever which left them largely confined to their hotel rooms			2
catering manager @entity145 said : ' we booked this holiday to celebrate our milestone birthdays in style but were bitterly disappointed when all three of us suffered from illness during our stay at the hotel			0
' we were horrified at the conditions at what was supposed to be a ' luxury ' hotel ; we were bitterly disappointed as this was meant to be a special holiday for us all and it was completely ruined			0
' we had actually pre booked another holiday the following year to the resort , but as a result of our experience there we wanted to change the destination with @entity24 and to add insult to injury we were told by the tour operator that we would be charged for this , but we took matters into our own hands and contacted the tv programme @entity190 ( the @entity192 version of @entity193 ) and @entity24 eventually waived the charges			0
' we are pleased and relieved that with the help of our legal team at @entity92 that we have now received a settlement and justice for our holiday which was ruined whilst staying at the @entity200			0
we can now move forward from this and put the ordeal behind us			0
