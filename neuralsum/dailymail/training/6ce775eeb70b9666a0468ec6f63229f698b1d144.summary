thousands of fervent football fans have fancied their chances at @entity2 , while countless other punters have had a crack at it too			0
after all , just how hard could it really be to place the position of the ball missing from a football live action photograph ? well , as it turns out , extremely hard			1
so hard , in fact , that no one has won the game ’s £ 250,000 jackpot for more than a decade , it was revealed yesterday			2
mr @entity17 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ‘ if no one won the @entity30 jackpot for that long there ’d be an outcry ' some 14,000 people a week regularly play the @entity34 - run game , but the last time anyone actually managed to pinpoint the ball exactly was in 2004			1
the jaw - dropping discovery was made by @entity17 , 66 , when he confronted organisers in frustration at winning just £ 10 and a couple of £ 2 vouchers despite spending £ 1,300 over 11 years			1
mr @entity17 , a retired local newspaper editor of @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ‘ if no one won the @entity30 jackpot for that long there ’d be an outcry			2
by the laws of probability you ’d have thought someone must have won it by now			0
’ in its @entity51 heyday spot the ball was played by three million people a week			1
but interest fell after the @entity30 was launched in 1994			2
the weekly game has some 14,000 devotees paying a minimum 50p for 50 guesses but no one has scooped the top prize since 2004 @entity62 fan mr @entity17 puts £ 2.50 a week on 1,000 crosses			1
players are provided with specially printed sheets of small stick - on crosses allowing them to cover areas of the competition photo with blocks of guesses if they wish			0
but frustration at winning so little over the years drove mr @entity17 to contact the organisers about when anyone last scooped the jackpot – which , unlike the @entity30 ’s , does not roll over each week if not won			1
yesterday a @entity34 spokesman said : ‘ @entity76 have won £ 16million in prizes over the last ten years			0
‘ the top prize is won by guessing the exact centre of the ball but this has not happened since 2004 , reflecting the fact that fewer people play the game			2
‘ however , the £ 16million has been paid out to weekly winners for other prizes on offer , including for being closest to the centre of the ball			0
’ the last winner of the jackpot was a grandmother who won the £ 250,000 prize after a tip from beyond the grave from her dead mother			0
@entity95 , then 69 , of @entity96 , @entity97 , said after winning that her mother @entity98 had told her at a seance : ‘ do n’t forget the coupon , ’ just before she had planned to stop her £ 3 weekly flutter on the game after 40 years of playing .			0

the last @entity62 jackpot was won in 2004
