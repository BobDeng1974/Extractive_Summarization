@entity1 is ‘ wide open to abuse ’ by @entity3 migrants looking to ‘ freeload ’ on our welfare system , the foreign secretary warned last night			1
@entity6 told @entity7 that a major reduction in @entity3 immigration was needed to ‘ satisfy @entity1 public opinion ’ ahead of a planned in / out referendum on @entity12			1
mr @entity6 said @entity1 had already tightened welfare rules in order to discourage migrants , and would take further domestic measures			1
but he warned that changes would also be needed at @entity3 level			1
he told mps on the @entity22 : ‘ we are wide open to abuse			0
we have tightened up some things already and there are going to be more measures that we can introduce to make it more difficult for people from the @entity3 to abuse our system			2
‘ but there will be some areas where we need changes ( at @entity3 level ) to change the way the @entity3 rules work if we are to have sufficient impact on immigration levels to satisfy @entity1 public opinion			1
‘ and that is what we want to do – we are politicians and we are getting a very clear message from the public that this is an issue of significant concern to them			0
’ mr @entity6 conceded that @entity1 would not be allowed to opt out of the @entity3 ’s free movement rules altogether – and said that @entity44 ’s negotiations would focus on ‘ the art of the possible ’			1
but he insisted that other @entity3 countries were willing to be flexible because they are desperate to keep @entity1 in the @entity3			2
sir @entity47 ( pictured ) has suggested that @entity48 is slowly fading in the @entity1 ‘ i have visited 18 @entity3 states and i am very clear that we will be able to negotiate a significant package of reform , ’ he said			2
earlier , mr @entity6 told the @entity22 : ‘ free movement to work is one of the principles of the @entity3			1
free movement to freeload is not one of the principles of the @entity3 , and @entity1 is not the only country that is affected by this problem and not the only country determined to address it			0

mr @entity6 confirmed speculation that the referendum could be held earlier , saying he would like to see it take place ‘ as soon as possible ’			0
the foreign secretary has previously indicated he would vote to leave the @entity3 if the referendum were held on @entity1 ’s current membership terms			1
but on tuesday he insisted he was open to changing his mind if the prime minister negotiates significant change			0
his intervention came as sir @entity47 suggested that @entity48 is slowly fading in the @entity1			0
the former prime minister , who has been tipped to play a key role in the negotiations , predicts @entity1 will vote to stay in the @entity3			0
he told the @entity12 magazine : ‘ there has always been a minority of the population who emotionally regard themselves as being @entity1 but not @entity12			2
but this feeling fades with each generation			0
each successive generation regards itself as more @entity12 than its predecessor			0

@entity6 said change needed before a planned in / out referendum on @entity12
