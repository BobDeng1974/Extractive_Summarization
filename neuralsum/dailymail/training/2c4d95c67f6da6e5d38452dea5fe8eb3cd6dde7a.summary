by @entity0 when @entity3 ’s players begin their lap of honour on sunday , the chances are they will be left wondering what might have been			2
but they can not lose sight of their achievements over the past 10 months			0
@entity3 have had an outstanding season and for long periods were the best team in the land			1
and who knows , if @entity13 suffer an unexpected slip , they could yet be crowned champions			0
the likelihood , however , is that there will be no trophy , as was the case in 2002 and 2009 when the club last mounted a challenge for the @entity24 title			1
those were the best @entity3 teams i played in but does anyone remember that ? no. why ? we did n’t win anything			2
blown it : @entity3 striker @entity32 hides his face after his side threw away a three - goal lead to draw 3 - 3 with @entity36 on the up : @entity39 boss @entity38 has transformed @entity3 into title contenders this season shocked : @entity3 skipper @entity41 ( second from right ) and @entity43 ( second from left ) applaud the travelling fans at @entity45 everyone remembers the team who won the @entity49 in @entity50 nine years ago , but they were nowhere near as good as the side @entity38 has put together in this campaign , a side who have scored goals for fun and won 11 consecutive @entity24 games			1
do not underestimate how much of @entity3 ’s improved form is down to @entity38			1
unlike the managers at @entity61 and @entity13 , he has n’t been shopping at the top end , paying huge fees and huge wages ; @entity38 ’ success comes from endless hours coaching on the training ground			2
look at the number of players who have improved : @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 have come on so much , you would expect them to start when @entity74 face @entity75 at the @entity76 , and @entity77 could also get a seat on the plane if there are injuries this weekend			0
even @entity41 and @entity32 have benefited ; @entity41 has excelled in a new , deep - lying midfield role , while @entity32 ’s form going up another level owes a lot to his tactically - aware manager			0
@entity3 have flourished thanks to @entity38 , not because @entity88 have emulated @entity89 and @entity90			1
@entity91 bound ? winger @entity70 , pictured here scoring against @entity92 , has flourished under @entity38 on fire : @entity32 is enjoying his best season in front of goal since moving to @entity97 from @entity98 guidance : @entity70 has credited @entity38 ' belief in him as a key reason behind his impressive form in the two campaigns in which i came closest to the title , we needed two or three quality signings to make the next step , but the subsequent transfer windows were filled with poor signings as @entity111 , @entity112 and their scouts made mistakes that prevented us from pushing on			1
@entity111 , for instance , rejected the chance to sign @entity117 after a successful loan spell in 2002			2
@entity117 helped us get to 80 points but @entity111 instead bought the @entity121 pair @entity122 and @entity123 , as well as the @entity125 midfielder @entity124 , for more than £ 20million			2
@entity123 scored twice on his @entity97 debut against @entity127 but that was a rare highlight			0
after initial training sessions , you hoped nerves were holding them back , but within a few months it was clear they would n’t improve us			0
we ended up finishing fifth , with 64 points			0
it was a similar situation in 2009			0
@entity112 sold @entity137 and bought the injured @entity138 ; @entity139 left and was replaced by @entity140 ; the situation was also aggravated as the signings that had been made in the summer of 2008 were not up to standard , either			1
people such as @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 had rarely played as we fought it out with @entity148 but in 2009 - 10 , when injuries and suspensions kicked in , they were found wanting when we needed them to step up			0
back in 2009 , @entity3 looked at bringing @entity151 back to @entity97 ; @entity152 were interested , too , but @entity148 unexpectedly moved in and @entity151 told me about a revealing conversation he ’d had with sir @entity155			1
you might have thought @entity155 would have been worried about us bridging a four - point deficit , but he said to @entity151 he could n’t see @entity3 having it in them to go again and that @entity61 were @entity148 ’s biggest obstacle			0
@entity61 won the title , we finished seventh with 63 points			0
so now is where things become complicated for the modern @entity3 and many will wonder — me included — if they have it in them to go again should they miss out			0
it is essential the moves they make once the window opens are right			0
flop : @entity138 failed to make the grade at @entity3 as a replacement for @entity137 mistakes : @entity176 columnist @entity0 believes former manager @entity112 made errors in the transfer market rejuvenated : @entity38 has helped @entity32 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) hit top form this season look at last summer ’s signings			1
the big money buys , @entity43 and @entity182 , have done ok but need to improve , while the rest — @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 — failed to contribute			1
what difference would they have made if they had been a success ? @entity186 and @entity187 , who came on loan , will go back to their parent clubs , but if @entity184 and @entity185 stay they will have to start making a difference , as @entity3 ’s workload will be increased with the @entity49 to factor in			1
@entity3 do n’t need a summer where they buy players to fit in around the edges			2
they need three players to go straight into the team — two defenders and a midfielder — then another striker and a wide player to add depth and quality			0
disappointment : @entity186 ( left ) has struggled to make an impact since joining on loan from @entity61 pressure : @entity38 must spend his summer budget more wisely than he did last year room for improvement : summer signing @entity182 ( right ) has enjoyed a mixed campaign we hear a lot about the transfer committee who work behind the scenes at @entity97 but however the system operates , the owners need to back @entity38 financially and trust his judgment to bring in the quality that will prevent a repeat of what happened after 2002 and 2009			1
@entity38 , his scouting team and the owners need to learn the lessons from the mistakes that were made in the past and ensure this campaign is a springboard for future success rather than the summit of ambitions			1
it took @entity111 and @entity112 four seasons to make a title challenge but @entity38 has done it in two , in a more entertaining style , albeit with the help of having no @entity247 football			1
whatever happens this weekend , @entity3 now have to challenge for the title year in , year out .			2

@entity3 have had an outstanding season but may well end it without *silverware*
@entity38 *deserves* credit for turning the @entity39 into @entity24 title contenders
summer signings such as @entity186 and @entity184 have failed to impress
@entity111 and @entity112 both made mistakes in the transfer market during their time at @entity97
@entity38 needs support to continue his good work
