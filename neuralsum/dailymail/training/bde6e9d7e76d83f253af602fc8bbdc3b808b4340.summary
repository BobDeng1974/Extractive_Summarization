mrs @entity191 was too poor to afford a lawyer at the time so she was unable to contest custody			0
even today her emotional scars are so deep that she has left a dramatic voicemail on her home answerphone : ' if this is @entity44 , please leave your number and i will call you			0
i ’ve been waiting to hear from you			0
' one state away : @entity7 told @entity207 that he was taking their daughter to @entity132 , and she only discovered after his death that the girl had been living in @entity202 this whole time the disclosure is another sign that the death of mr @entity7 , 46 , last july the day after he collected his winning check has exposed the divisions within his family			1

after taxes , the prize money amounted to $ 425,000 as he took it in a lump sum			2
the initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was ruled as by natural causes			2
it was only when @entity104 intervened that the poison was found by further tests			2
since then the final meal that @entity7 , 46 , consumed has become central to the case			1
according to multiple reports , he was at home at the time with @entity41 , @entity326 and @entity44			0
