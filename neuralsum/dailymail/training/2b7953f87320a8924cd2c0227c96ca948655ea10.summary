the parents of a college student who was shot to death 10 years ago are finally breaking their silence and revealing that they believe a swat team killed their daughter			1
@entity6 and @entity8 's daughter @entity7 was just a few months shy of graduating from @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 when she was taken captive in her apartment by @entity13			1
@entity14 eventually agreed to free the 22 - year - old after speaking with a hostage negotiator , yet the @entity17 claim that just seconds later their daughter was dead after a ' rogue ' @entity4 member entered the apartment and startled @entity13 , resulting in him dropping his his gun which went off and killed @entity7			1
@entity21 ( right , with friend ) was killed 10 years ago after being held captive in her apartment now her parents are opening up saying she was shot after a ' rogue ' @entity4 member tried to take out her captor , startling him so much he dropped his gun which went off and killed their daughter ' did @entity7 have to die ? that ’s the question that ’s been in my head for all these years , ' @entity6 told the @entity29			1
@entity6 and his wife have thought about speaking out for years they revealed , and telling everyone how the ' cowboy - like ' actions of this one person ended their daughter 's life , but have waited until now , 10 years alter			2
' i lost the most precious thing to me , ' said @entity6 , ' and i ca n’t begin to tell you how anyone would get through something like this			0
' in 2007 the couple did file a $ 150million wrongful death suit against the township , former police chief @entity45 and the @entity47 swat team , but in 2009 it was thrown out by common pleas judge @entity48 in 2009 in a summary judgment order			0
@entity8 believes that @entity45 , along with @entity51 prosecutor @entity50 and @entity48 , were ' all in bed together			0
' @entity6 added that he and his wife ' spent a lot of time trying to develop a case that has n’t worked , and we do n’t expect it ’s going to work because i do n’t think you ’re going to beat the government			0
the government there is controlling the police			0
' @entity13 was high on crystal meth the night he took @entity7 hostage , having been firing hundreds of shots at cops as he made his way through the woods in the are after murdering his girlfriend , @entity72 , 42 , and her son , @entity74 , 7 , on jan. 21 , 2005			1
after speaking with a hostage negotiation a little before midnight he finally agreed to @entity7 's release			1
@entity13 ( above ) , the man who killed @entity7 , was high on crystal meth and had just murdered his girlfriend and her son ' he said : " give me a couple of hours to get my s --- together , and i ’ll let her go , " ' said @entity84 of the @entity85 in his testimony during @entity13 's murder trial			1
just moments later , @entity7 was dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck			1
@entity14 has maintained that he was holding his gin and dropped in when the ' rogue ' sniper appeared from off the patio and took a shot at him - and even @entity8 's parents agree with this version of events			1
' @entity14 dropped the gun , it went off and killed @entity7			1
he was going for a rifle he had , ' said @entity6			0
and ballistics seem to back up that a second bullet was indeed fired at @entity14 , though it missed			2
in fact , at one point , claims @entity6 , they even found a cop willing to go on record and admit what really happened - and confirm their version of events			2
' i had my investigator go and speak with him			0
he knew there was a guy in there			0
he said straight out : " i can prove it			0
" but he was too afraid for his family to stand up in court , ' said @entity122 , it is n't about the money or even justice as much as just knowing what happened to their daughter in those final minutes of her life			2
' there must be people out there who want to say something , but they ’re afraid to , ' said @entity6			0
' maybe now that the pressure ’s off someone will come forward			0
' cops had previously argued that what @entity14 saw was a grill on the deck , a claim they backed up by pointing out he had fired eight rounds into it			2
more than other drugs , the use of meth does leave some seeing things that are not really there or confusing inanimate objects for people .			2
