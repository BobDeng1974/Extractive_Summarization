on the whole us @entity0 have got a bad reputation overseas			1
whether it 's lounging by the pool shouting up to your friend 's hotel balcony , spilling beer like it 's water or lunging at anything in a skirt , being in a foreign clime becomes like a passport to loose behaviour			2
from @entity15 to @entity16 and @entity17 to @entity18 , our strange whims , afternoon drinking sessions and often total disregard for local custom means we stick out like a sore thumb			1
unsurprisingly then , a study by @entity27 found that out of all nationalities , @entity28 think their fellow countrymen are the most likely to stand out as tourists on holiday , @entity25 came a close second			1
over a third felt they would have a more ' authentic ' travel experience if they blended in better with the locals			1
for those who care , here are a few obvious pointers of where you are going wrong			2
if there 's one thing we 're not , it 's inconspicuous ... keep your clothes on in general , unless on a beach , this is a good code to live by			2
who wants to see nipples at lunch ? last year the @entity25 newspaper @entity57 ran an article dissecting the atypical @entity59 abroad			1
it was titled ' @entity57 explains the @entity61 ( of @entity16 ) ' and one of the charges leveled against us was something called ' prince harry syndrome ' , or the ' pathological need constantly to undress '			1
they also described @entity28 women as suffering from ' underwear amnesia '			2
remember where you left your underwear , be mindful of local customs and cultures ( especially around places of worship ) and ( to help you with the point below ) keep your shirt on where possible			0
brits will shed their clothes at the merest hint of a sunny day , so expect copious amount of fleshy mounds once they hit the beach			2
@entity25 newspaper @entity57 has described this phenomenon as ' the pathological need constantly to undress ' , which seems a little harsh wear sun cream nothing says i 'm a @entity59 abroad like sun burn			2
even if you have n't seen sunshine for the best part of a year it 's best to pretend you know what you are doing			0
a @entity101 poll found that nine million @entity0 get sunburn every single time they go abroad and one in ten admit to burning twice on the same holiday			1
inflamed , beetroot skin is not only horribly uncomfortable but it makes you look like a complete rookie			0
@entity107 is cheating ! lobster pink skin never has been , and never will be , a good look , yet many @entity0 still refuse to cover up or slap on the sunscreen tip : suncream can often be bought more cheaply in the country you are travelling to so resist the Â£ 10 bottle at the airport and buy some at the nearest supermarket			1
do n't be a yob the international community views @entity0 as a loud , abrasive , heckling bunch of hee - hawing numpties			1
we do n't bother to learn the local language , preferring to speak @entity123 increasingly loudly and slowly until we get what we want			0
being polite goes a long way			0
learn some local words , chat to your waiter , hotel manager or fellow guests and always be courteous			0
as your mother told you , manners cost nothing			0
drinking almost as obligatory as showing your boarding pass to cabin crew is the @entity28 airport drink , or ten			2
never mind that it 's 8am and the @entity138 has n't opened			0
you 'll find a drink and , probably , wo n't stop until you return home			0
if there 's one thing @entity0 abroad are good at , it 's drinking			1
by the pool , in the pool , or even down a tube , we 'll guzzle just about anything with a minimum 40 % alcohol content studies show that half of @entity28 holidaymakers drink alcohol every day on summer breaks - and one in three admit to boozing in the departure lounge			0
it 's pretty likely that even brits trekking to @entity159 will be weighed down by vodka			2
save yourself a horrible injury , a misjudged fling or jail time and sip rather than guzzle			0
around half of @entity0 admit to drinking every day while they 're on holiday , and one in three admit to boozing in the departure lounge			1
it 's ok to take a day or two off , promise ... union jacks just in case locals missed you doing any , or all , of the above , you can be sure to let them know of your proud heritage by splattering @entity175 across all your holiday gear			2
this is the perfect way to show other what a hopeless foreigner you are , how ripe you are for pick pockets and opportunistic salesmen			0
worst offending items are towels , shorts , hats and bags			1
just leave it behind or , better yet , do n't buy it in the first place			0
you 'll never guess where i 'm from ? @entity0 love to advertise their heritage via tacky @entity192 holiday accessories			1
just put it away , please ! ridiculous hats brits abroad and silly hats are like moths to a flame			1
@entity200 , handkerchiefs tied into knots and promotional pork pie headgear might protect your head from the sun but they do nothing for your image			0
fry ups if there is a time and a place for a fry up it is not while watching the sun rise behind the @entity215 or after a night sipping cocktails on a remote @entity218 island			0
if we 're not on the sauce , we 're probably sloshing it all over a hearty great @entity28 fry up			0
our ability to chow down a hot plate of bacon , sausages and eggs in sweltering heat is the stuff that legends are made of it 's almost impressive how diligently @entity0 abroad force down a hot plate of beans , sausages , eggs and bacon even in sweltering 30 degree heat			1
a international survey by hotels.com revealed the full @entity123 fry up to be the world 's favourite breakfast			0
it also found that a quarter of us take teabags , brown sauce and even bacon with us when travelling			0
@entity0 love to sample the local cuisine when they 're abroad			1
did you know that @entity249 's now has restaurants in 120 countries around the world ? the possibilities are mind - blowing ... but part of visiting another country means trying new things , food included , and breakfast is the perfect place to start			0
socks and sandals just because @entity263 and @entity264 have been spotted sporting this confusing sartorial statement does n't give you a right to			1
it 's not ironic , it 's not practical and it will give you sock marks			0
there is simply no excuse for pairing socks with your sandals			1
@entity28 has a rich history of sock and sandal wearing , mostly from those north of 50 , and last summer there was a moment when fashion commentators tried to persuade us it was a good look after @entity283 and @entity284 catwalks showed them together			2
still , there 's no quicker way to look like a very @entity28 idiot abroad than by wearing them .			1

a third of @entity0 think they would have a better holiday if they blended in
from @entity15 to @entity16 and @entity17 brits stick out like sore thumbs
drinking , @entity192 towels and getting naked all contribute to *stereotypes*
as does wearing silly hats or socks and sandals while on holiday abroad
