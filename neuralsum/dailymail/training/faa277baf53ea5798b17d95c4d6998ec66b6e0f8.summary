a landmark but unflown aircraft , dubbed the ' @entity2 of the skies ' , is being recreated by a @entity5 engineer working with a team in @entity7			1
the @entity8 was described as one of the most advanced planes of its era and if it had flown , its designers believed it would have reached 500mph			0
at the time the air speed record , set by a @entity17 messerschmitt in 1939 , was 469mph			0
@entity32 was keen to avoid the @entity33 getting hold of the plane 's cutting - edge technology , so the aircraft was packed in crates and hid in a barn in the @entity41 countryside			1
mr @entity32 , who became a @entity41 citizen in between the wars , was known to dislike the @entity17 and had wanted to take them on in an aircraft race known as the @entity46			1
the @entity41 government knew about the plane , but it could not be made in time for a deadline of september 1939 to enter the race			1
as the @entity52 began , he decided to hide the aircraft			1
the only aircraft built by @entity8 was resigned to history until a team of engineers and enthusiasts sets about recreating the plane			1
a model is pictured here it is thought that @entity62 , one of @entity65 ' ­ s ministers , was aware of the plane and if the @entity33 had got hold of the technology it could have eliminated the @entity70			1
the @entity8 featured a twin , mid-mounted engine design			0
both engines would be eight cylinder 4.9 litre race car engines producing 450hp each			1
the power would be transmitted to the propellers using twin drive - shafts located just under the pilot ’s elbows and attached to the double , counter-spinning propellers via nose - mounted transmission			0
the wings and fuselage were designed to provide high strength at a low weight and were constructed from a multi-layer wood laminate - a concept still used by many planes today			0
the plane also featured cutting - edge aerodynamics with forward pitched wings , a zero - drag cooling system , and computer - directed flight control			2
it would have approached speeds of 500mph , a feat previously only achieved by aircraft with twice the horsepower			1
the @entity8 was also much more compact than most aircraft of the era , with a wingspan of nearly 27 ft ( 8.2m ) and an overall length of approximately 25.25 ft ( 7.7m )			1
the plane survived the war but never flew and , 70 years later , found itself in a @entity108 museum too fragile to ever be restored			1
aeronautical enthusiasts have long thought it was an industry tragedy that the @entity8 , with its stunning design and ground - breaking performance , never got the chance to fly			0
the only aircraft built by @entity8 was resigned to history until a team of engineers and enthusiasts sets about recreating the plane			1
@entity121 - born @entity120 , the engineering director , is one of the driving forces behind the project dubbed @entity124			1
mr @entity120 , 59 , who runs his own model making company in @entity126 , is a former @entity127 engineer and used to work on the @entity129 bomber			1
the trained pilot has played a vital role in designing and building the complex gearbox for the model @entity8 plane			2
he said : ‘ the @entity8 was 85 per cent complete when the @entity17 invaded			0
‘ if it had flown in 1940 then it would have been a revolution			2
it was an incredible aeroplane and @entity138 , who worked on it with @entity32 , was a brilliant engineer			1
' designed in collaboration with @entity32 and @entity140 engineer @entity138 , the original 1937 @entity8 is considered by many to be one of the most technologically advanced aircrafts of the era the @entity8 featured a twin , mid-mounted engine design			1

‘ however , these days it is in a very fragile state and it does n't have an engine , ' said mr @entity120			1
‘ i got involved with the project four years ago after i was sent a picture of the @entity8 and told some people were building one			0
the hope is for the model plane to be flying by october , and appearing across @entity199 at prestigious events like the @entity201 and @entity202 @entity32 was forced to conceal the elegant aircraft by packing it up and hiding it in a @entity41 barn to prevent the @entity17 military discovering it			1
it is thought @entity209 , one of @entity65 ' ­ s ministers , was aware of the plane and if they got hold of the technology it could have eliminated the @entity70 ‘ i got in touch with @entity217 and he asked me if i could build a gearbox			2
it is a very complicated drivetrain but i thought i could have a go at reverse engineering it from the plans and photos			0
‘ the plane was designed to fly very fast in a straight line but the gearbox would n't have much longevity			2
so i set about seeing what was needed to give it a few hundred hours of flight			0
‘ it took a while but i managed to design one in computer aided design ( @entity237 ) software			0
i also had help from a group of engineering friends who were gearbox experts			0
’ after suffering some setbacks which delayed completion , a gearbox was finally manufactured before being sent out to the @entity108 @entity32 , who helped build the @entity8 , is pictured with his son @entity245 in 1933			1
the plane would have been fitted with two 450 horsepower engines and was designed to reach speeds approaching 500mph , a feat which had never at the time been achieved mr @entity120 then met up with managing director @entity217 , from @entity252 , @entity7 and @entity253 , a @entity254 who is the commercial director , in @entity7			1
they hooked the gearbox up to the plane and , to the delight of everyone involved , it ran perfectly			2
designed in collaboration with @entity32 and @entity140 engineer @entity138 , the original 1937 @entity8 is considered by many to be one of the most technologically advanced aircrafts of the era			1
handcrafted using largely the same materials and processes as the original , the recreation is dimensionally and aerodynamically identical to the original plane and includes elements of the five patents that @entity8 was originally awarded for the @entity8			2
but instead of replicating the original engine , the team opted to fix their @entity8 with two @entity277 motorbike engines which develop 200bhp each - giving it a speed of more than 200mph			2
the aircraft will make its official global debut next month at @entity283 , a @entity280 institution devoted to the preservation of @entity41 art and automobiles from the @entity288 era			0
@entity121 - born @entity120 , the engineering director , is one of the driving forces behind the project dubbed @entity124			1
the trained pilot has played a vital role in designing and building the complex gearbox for the model @entity8 plane it will be part of the art of @entity8 exhibition and will stay there until the autumn when it will return to @entity7 when the engines will be installed			1
the hope is for it to be flying by october , and appearing across @entity199 at prestigious events like the @entity201 and @entity202			0
@entity217 , @entity124 managing director , said : ‘ for the first time , this incredible piece of engineering and design will receive the broad recognition it deserves , 77 years later			0
’ father - of - six @entity32 , born in @entity310 in 1881 , was a pioneering sports car designer			1
he built his first car before his 20th birthday and started his own company in 1910			0
he died in @entity314 in 1947			0
according to the @entity320 , ‘ @entity8 's work was characterized by a unique combination of advanced yet simple engineering and artistic execution of all technical details			0
’ he was known for creating every @entity8 model with parts that were used in other @entity8 models - meaning they were made not just in series			0
his company , founded in 1909 , survives to this day .			0

near completion in 1940 , @entity32 was forced to conceal the aircraft
the plane survived the war hidden from the enemy but never flew
now @entity5 engineer @entity120 , 59 , is developing a working replica
@entity337 would have been fitted with two 450 horsepower engines and had a wingspan of nearly 27 ft ( 8.2m )
