' they were ran through the till and , when told the value of the transaction , each supporter offered £ 1			1
that , of course , is significant because it ’s the same amount at which @entity4 values the name of @entity6			1
' the symbolic part is that he values his golf clubs , t - shirts or whatever other sporting goods he sells at far greater than the name of our club ’s stadium			0
' we were in the store for just under an hour and we also shut off tills in @entity36 for half an hour after that			0
