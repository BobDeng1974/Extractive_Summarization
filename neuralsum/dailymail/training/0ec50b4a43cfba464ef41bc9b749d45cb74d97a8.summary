by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 9 may 2013 @entity1 joined the paid - content streaming video fray today as it officially outlined its selection of premium channels , many with a decidedly nostalgic bent , starting at $ 0.99 per month			1
@entity8 's campy b movies , children 's shows like ‘ @entity11 ’ and ‘ @entity12 , ’ and inspirational monologues by celebrities - these are among the offerings on 30 channels that will soon require a paid monthly subscription on @entity1			1
although the world 's largest video site has rented and sold movies and tv shows from major studios since late 2008 , most people watch videos on @entity1 for free			1
classics : a screenshot shows the @entity28 's premium @entity1 channel , one of 30 initially offered as the video giant enters the paid content market it 's the first time @entity1 is introducing all - you - can - watch channels that require a monthly fee			1
the least expensive of the channels at will cost 99 cents a month but the average price is around $ 2.99			1
in the field of paid video content online , @entity1 is playing catch up to services like @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , all of which have millions of paying customers			2
@entity43 shares soared in april after the runaway success of its original series @entity52 and expects similar returns from their release of new episodes of @entity56 , a comedy that once aired on @entity58			2
but with a billion monthly visitors from around the globe , the @entity60 - owned video service hopes to quickly add subscribers and add to the money it already makes from online advertising			2
‘ this is just the beginning , ’ said @entity67 , @entity1 's director of content partnerships			2
the site plans to roll out a way for a broad number of partners to also launch pay channels on their own soon			2
@entity76 : @entity8 , whose credits included the cult camp classics @entity79 and @entity80 , will also have his own paid channel and kids : @entity84 's classics will be channels offering old kids favorites like @entity12			1
@entity88 channels start off at 99 cents per month , but each is priced differently @entity8 , a producer and director whose influential cult classics like ‘ @entity92 ’ and ‘ piranha ’ earned him an honorary @entity94 in 2009 , said he 's kept his 400 - film library off of video streaming sites until now			1
in an interview with the @entity98 , he said he turned down an offer from @entity44 for about $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 per film several years ago , but sees promise in the @entity1 offering			0
his channel , ‘ @entity8 's drive - in , ’ will cost subscribers $ 3.99 per month for a rotating selection of 30 movies , refreshed with new interviews and clips from films that are in production			1
it is set to launch in june			0
‘ i believed for many years that the future of motion picture distribution , particularly for the independents , is on the @entity117 , ’ said the 87 - year - old director			0
‘ i think the time is now			0
’ @entity1 will keep slightly less than half of the revenue generated by the subscriptions			0
@entity8 's wife and producing partner @entity123 said they were taken aback at @entity1 's potential after a clip of their 2010 movie ‘ @entity130 ’ went viral with 11 million views			1
if even 1 percent of those viewers signed up for a subscription , it would amount to a healthy revenue stream , she said			0
‘ the numbers are astonishing			0
we 're waiting for the fireworks display , ’ she said			0
different : until now , the @entity60 - owned company has largely been known for ad - driven content that is free to users			0
it now joins paid providers @entity44 , @entity43 , and @entity45			0

@entity79 ' creator @entity8 to have his own channel *alongside* the @entity28 , @entity146 , and around 30 others
