by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 23 august 2013 the @entity2 spacecraft hitched a ride from a helicopter to allow scientists to test its flight computer and navigation instruments			0
a ' captive - carry test ' was successfully completed yesterday in @entity9 in preparation for the new spacecraft 's first unaided flight scheduled for this autumn			1
the test , which is the first time pilots have ' flown ' a fully - functional @entity2 vehicle , took two hours and followed the path the spacecraft will one day fly independently			1
the captive - carry test was run by @entity25 partner @entity39 ( @entity39 ) of @entity41 , @entity42			1
an @entity44 helicopter picked up a test version of the @entity2 flight vehicle and flew it a distance of three miles over a dry lake bed at @entity49 at a maximum altitude of 12,400 feet			0
an @entity44 helicopter picked up a test version of the @entity2 and flew it a distance of three miles at a maximum altitude of 12,400 feet the spacecraft followed the projected path it will fly during future approach and landing tests at @entity59 , @entity25 said			2
the spacecraft 's flight computer , along with its guidance , navigation and control systems were tested and the landing gear and nose skid were also deployed during flight			0
' today is the first time we have flown a fully functional @entity2 flight vehicle and we are very pleased with the results , ' said @entity72 , corporate vice president and head of @entity39 's @entity74			1
' we have worked closely with @entity25 , @entity59 and the @entity75 to reach this important milestone in our flight test program			0
' we look forward to seeing @entity2 land on the same runway as the space shuttle orbiters once did as we move forward in the development of the next - generation crew transportation vehicle			0
' this was the second captive - carry test of the @entity2 flight vehicle			1
data obtained from the test will provide valuable information about the spacecraft 's hardware and ground operations to pave the way for upcoming free - flight tests at @entity59 this autumn			2
before the test could take place , the @entity2 's braking and landing systems were tested during ground tow tests , at increasing speeds , while @entity39 engineers also checked the spacecraft 's computer and software systems , instrumentation and steering .			0
