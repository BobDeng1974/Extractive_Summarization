there 's a strict set of standards for organic foods			1
but the rules are looser for household cleaners , textiles , cosmetics and the organic dry cleaners down the street			2
it 's a little known fact that the @entity11 does n't regulate the use of the term ' organic ' for any of such products , unless they 're made entirely from food or agriculture products overseen by its @entity17			1
companies , therefore , can brand their non-food products as ‘ organic ’ with little @entity11 oversight as long as they do n't use the @entity11 organic seal or certification			1
confusing : it 's a little known fact that the @entity11 does n't regulate the use of the term ' organic ' for many non-food products including cleaners , personal care products and textiles when it comes to personal care products , clothing , bed linen or even some gardening products , a shopper 's only way to be sure they are really buying organic , is do his or her own research			1
' the consumer should not need a law degree to read a label , ' says @entity43 , president of the @entity44 , the industry 's main trade group			0
concerned about the image of organics , the association is pressuring the government to better investigate organic claims on non-food items			1
according to its figures , sales of these non-food organic items were about $ 2.8 billion last year , a small share of the overall organic market but growing rapidly ; and unlike food , with very little regulation			1
@entity60 , head of the @entity11 's @entity17 maintains there are indeed clear standards for items within the scope of its regulation , but says : ' the areas that are outside of our scope could cause some confusion			1
' the @entity71 normally investigates deceptive claims			0
but the agency demurred in its ' @entity74 ' published in 2012 , saying enforcement of organic claims on non-food products could duplicate @entity11 duties			1
a claim is only deceptive if it misleads consumers , the agency says			0
so , it will study consumer perceptions of the word organic			2
but officials were n't able to say when such a study might begin			2
lotions and potions : sales of non-food organic items were about $ 2.8 billion last year , a small share of the overall organic market but growing rapidly ; and unlike food , with very little regulation ms @entity43 of the @entity44 says the lack of enforcement could erode confidence in the organic industry as a whole			1
the industry has similarly been fighting overuse of the word ' natural , ' which has no legal meaning at all			0
' companies are chasing the consumers and the government is in the rear - view mirror , ' says @entity108 , head of the @entity109 , an advocacy group that publishes online consumer databases on cosmetics and cleaning			0
so what 's a consumer to do , especially when organic products are often more expensive and the market is continuing to grow ? right now , retailers are the first line of defense			1
four years ago , @entity120 announced strict standards for labeling in the store 's well - stocked cosmetics , home cleaning and clothing aisles			0
the retailer also requires all products to list ingredients			2
@entity129 , global quality standards coordinator for the @entity133 , @entity132 - based chain , says : ' in areas where there is n't a government regulation , we have stepped up to create our own			2
' approved : some retailers , including @entity120 ( items pictured ) , enforce strict standards for labeling in its cosmetics , home cleaning and clothing aisles @entity146 , the president of dr. @entity148 's @entity147 , has fought for years to get the @entity11 to expand its powers on organics to include personal care products			1
he says @entity120 ' standards have helped clean up the market , but there are still less scrupulous companies that stretch the meaning of the word organic			2
often this includes petroleum - based oils and non-organic palm and coconut oils - which are not generally perceived as organic by the general public - and make up the base of many personal care products			1
some grocery stores , spas and online retailers have no standards at all ; and some dry cleaners promote ' organic ' on their windows and in their stores , despite there being no legal definition for the practice			0
@entity177 , ceo of the industry group @entity178 , said some of those businesses may actually be using petroleum - based solutions			0
' the difficult part is the scientific meaning of organic and the consumer perception of the word , ' she says			0
' because there is no real regulation on this right now , you want to make sure you do n't mislead the public			0
' aside from @entity120 , there do exist private certification agencies ; including the @entity193 and the @entity194 , but most consumers do n't know to look for that label			0
mr @entity148 's advice to shoppers is to read labels carefully and scan lists of ingredients			0
if you find several unpronounceable ingredients that sound like chemicals , ' it 's probably not organic , ' he says .			0

the @entity11 does n't regulate the use of the term ' organic ' for many items , unless they 're made entirely from food or agriculture products
