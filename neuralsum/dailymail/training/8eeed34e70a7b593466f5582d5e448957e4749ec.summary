by @entity0 futuristic cityscapes featuring soaring skyscrapers , flying cars and all - seeing video screens are popular features of sci - fi films			1
and now one artist has imagined how that reality would affect @entity9 and @entity10 in less than a century			1
gone are @entity9 ’ breezy boulevards and grand open spaces and @entity10 ’s elegant @entity14 buildings			1
instead grimy streets are lined by sinister ' atmosphere - scraper ' buildings , while the cities ' inhabitants live in cramped conditions			2
scare @entity20 ! one artist has imagined what @entity9 and @entity10 might look like in less than 100 year ¿ s time			0
this terrifying vision of the future shows the view to the @entity26			2
gone are the open gardens and boulevards by the @entity29 , which have been replaced by towering grey skyscrapers and complex - looking covered roads a matter of time ? in the illustrations , massive metal buildings dwarfing landmarks such as @entity36 and the @entity26 feature , while @entity38 in @entity10 ( pictured ) looks like it has fallen on hard times in the dystopian vision of the future enormous industrial buildings give out a cold fluorescent light , dwarfing landmarks such as @entity36 and the @entity26 , while @entity38 looks like it has fallen on hard times in a dystopian vision of the future			1
the images were dreamed up by @entity49 concept designer @entity48 , who works in the @entity49 capital for a videogame company called @entity52			2
he has created futuristic cityscapes for the game @entity57 , as well as artwork for films and books , all of which show incredible attention to detail			0
not so triumphant : the images were dreamed up by @entity49 concept designer @entity48 who works in the @entity49 capital for a videogame company called @entity52			2
here , the @entity65 has been turned into some sort of look - out with wires snaking over it a time for robots : as well as huge neon signs , the cities feature flying vehicles , drones ( pictured ) and robots , which seem to have taken menial jobs of humans , such as sweeping the streets , and perhaps keep a watch on inhabitants an unholy mess ? while the cityscapes appear at first glance to be impressive and technologically advanced , there are few trees and rubbish strewn across roads , with wires exposed to provide electricity to ramshackle house			1
here , @entity36 peeps over the neglected buildings , complete with what looks like some sort of roadblock among the run - down buildings it is still possible to see signatures of the cities			1
for example , @entity9 retains some of its grand 17th century buildings and famous cafes			0
but they are largely neglected and littered with neon signs , overlooked by large metal factories , indicating the city will be more densely populated in the future			2
mr @entity48 ’s illustrations of the city are set in 2084 and he writes in a blog post that in the city , which is penned for a video game , augmented reality and memory manipulation have taken control of @entity115 ’ lives			2
in ' @entity126 ' , ‘ you can now digitise , buy , sell or trade you own personal memories			0
the last remainders of intimacy have been swept away , in what appears to be a simple extension of the development of social networks and geolocation at the beginning of the 21st century ’ he says			1
past grandeur : among the run - down buildings it is still possible to see signatures of cities			1
for example , @entity9 retains some of its grand 17th century buildings ( pictured ) and famous cafes coffee to go : landmarks and cafes are largely neglected ( pictured ) and littered with neon signs , overlooked by large metal skyscrapers , indicating that @entity9 will be more densely populated in the future , according to the artist 's futuristic vision mr @entity48 describes his vision of @entity9 in 2084			1
he says that ' the surveillance society has been accepted by the citizens themselves in exchange for a few technological benefits			0
it is a reality that no - one thinks of challenging anymore			0
' here , a futuristic flying vehicle and droid can be seen , as well as the @entity26 in the background this is perhaps reflected in the faceless skyscrapers with countless tiny windows that eclipse individual landmarks such as the once bohemian @entity154 and the @entity155			1
as well as huge neon signs , the cities feature flying vehicles , drones and robots , which seem to have taken the menial jobs of humans and perhaps keep a watch on inhabitants			1
in one image , an alluring looking female droid looks down to a street below her			0
vast prisons and giant airships or modes of transport paint a foreboding vision of the future			0
mr @entity48 says that in the drawings and game , ‘ the surveillance society has been accepted by the citizens themselves in exchange for a few technological benefits			0
it is a reality that no - one thinks of challenging anymore			0
’ cities in the sky : vast prisons and giant airships or modes of transport paint a foreboding vision of the future			0
here , a massive ship hovers foreboding above the clouds			0
complete with frees and buildings , it is almost like a miniature city high rise future : this image is of no specific city but crystallises the artist 's view that future urban spaces will be largely grey and as well as high rise in nature a glimpse of the past : the faceless skyscrapers with countless tiny windows eclipse individual landmarks such as the once bohemian @entity154 and the @entity155 ( pictured ) while grand old builds have been ' upgraded ' with metal add - ons and wires while the cityscapes appear at first glance to be impressive and technologically advanced , there are few trees and rubbish strewn across roads , with wires exposed to provide electricity to ramshackle houses			1
this is in stark contrast to smart buildings being designed today , which boast a plethora of environmental features , from artificial leaves and filters to make skyscrapers cleaner as well as wind turbines and solar panels , to pretty kaleidoscope features and expanses of glass to make life more pleasant for the people inside them			0
smart cities ? mr @entity48 's illustrations of the city are set in 2084 and he writes in a blog post that in the city , augmented reality and memory manipulation have taken control of @entity242 ' lives			0
his drawings also feature details such as the inside of a factory ( pictured ) more like @entity247 : this image closely resembles many cities of the future seen in sci - fi films , where incredibly tall buildings peek above the clouds and the world below is almost invisible			1

one @entity49 artist has imagined whet the cities will look like in 2084 and they feature towering skyscrapers , flying cars and surveillance drones as well as *relics* of former less technologically - advanced grandeur
landmarks *including* the @entity26 , @entity36 , @entity154 and @entity38 are *included*
@entity268 and open spaces are replaced with roads , large buildings with neon lights and bill boards
the video games designer says that people living in this vision of the city are under *surveliiance* in a ' simple extension of the development of social networks and geolocation at the beginning of the 21st century '
