by @entity0 @entity1 has vowed to prove he is a world class fighter by ripping the @entity4 welterweight crown from @entity5 when they clash at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 on august 16			1
@entity1 has had to bide his time for his first world title fight with three clashes against previous champion @entity13 cancelled through injuries to both men			1
the unbeaten @entity17 star , who arrived at promoter @entity18 ’s open day in a helicopter on wednesday , will travel to @entity20 in two weeks ’ time to complete his training camp , and @entity1 says that the time has come to show the world he belongs at the very top			1
travel in style : world title contender @entity1 is helicoptered to a promotion day by @entity28 ( right ) ‘ i ’ve been through the mill the last 18 months but all that is forgotten now , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ we ’ve got the date and after all the blood , sweat and tears it ’s going to be worth it and i will prove to all the doubters that i am the real deal on the big stage when i win the @entity40 on august 16			2
‘ we have been in training for a long time thinking it was going to be in july , then we thought it was august , then the beginning of september and now we ’re back to august			2
i do n’t know what is going on in their camp and really i do n’t care , i do n’t believe they want the fight , it ’s risky for them with little reward			0
i am a 32 - 0 @entity53 and they would prefer to fight someone else but that ’s why we worked hard to get the mandatory position so he has no option but to fight me			0
dominant : @entity1 thrashed @entity60 at the @entity61 in march ‘ the last few fights have been designed to keep me on track and focused but i have been ready for this world title shot for a long , long time			1
funny things can happen in boxing but you have to stay professional , i ’ve had a lot of advice from people who have been in my position , trying to secure a world title shot but getting frustrated , and that ’s helped me a lot			0
‘ i did n’t want to fight for a vacant belt , i want to take it from the best			0
people have doubted that i am the real deal , people say i have n’t been tested and as soon as i step up i will get beat ; i do n’t want easy fights – i want the best out there			0
@entity5 is the current champion and people are going to write me off , that ’s why i am excited because i am going to go out there to put a show on and take @entity5 out and bring the belt home			0
