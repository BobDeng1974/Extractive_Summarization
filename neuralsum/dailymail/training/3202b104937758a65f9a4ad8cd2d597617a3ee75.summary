@entity1 's mourners were handed a stunning development thursday with news that a secret intelligence assessment , issued just five days before the @entity6 bombings , specifically warned that the finish line area was an ' area of increased vulnerability ' for terrorist bombers			1
the report , now eerie in its accuracy , raised alarms over fears that terrorists could execute ' small scale bombings ' aimed at killing both marathon runners and spectators near the race 's end point			0
two officials read portions of the 18 - page report to a reporter in the @entity26 ' @entity1 bureau , according to the paper			2
that assessment , according to the @entity26 , included a caution that ' the @entity33 has not identified any specific lone offender or extremist group who pose a threat to the @entity6			0
' but the organization that prepared it , the @entity58 , is linked by its funding to the @entity38 @entity61 ( @entity61 ) - not to the @entity62 , which is the @entity33 's parent organization			0
questions remain about how much credible intelligence @entity61 had on the principal bombing suspect , the late @entity35 , before he and his brother detonated two shrapnel - laden pressure - cooker bombs , killing three and injuring hundreds			0
@entity6 runners were devastated after two bombs exploded near the finish line on april 15			2
a report cited by the @entity26 indicates that @entity1 terror - trackers considered the marathon 's finish line a high - risk target flowers and teddy bears dominated an impromptu memorial site in @entity1 's @entity80 , near the site of the april 15 bombings			1
@entity35 ( r ) and his brother @entity83 are the accused bombings			0
@entity35 was killed in a shootout with police just days after the bombings @entity89 's government gave the @entity38 specific intelligence about @entity35 and his terrorist sympathies in 2011			2
and a high - ranking @entity93 official has told @entity94 that his government warned the @entity38 about @entity35 in 2012 after denying him an entry visa in december 2011 , although @entity61 and the @entity93 embassy in @entity98 have issued denials about that report			2
@entity1 police commissioner @entity30 told a congressional panel on thursday morning that his department was never told about the @entity35 brothers			1
' we would have liked to have known , ' @entity30 testified in a @entity32 hearing , but ' we were not aware of the two brothers			0
we were not aware of their activities			0
' @entity1 police , he said , were n't aware they existed until three days after the bombings			1
' we did n't look at the brothers until after the shootout ' that claimed @entity35 's life , he said			0
ten days after the @entity1 bombings , @entity116 mayor @entity115 and police commissioner @entity117 announced that the @entity35 brothers planned to bomb @entity119			1
federal agencies did not share that information with @entity116 officials until long after the information could have made a difference anguish : first responders helped a screaming man into an ambulance - one of more than 200 who were injured in the bombings			1
three others died , including an 8 - year - old boy ' we would certainly have looked at the information ' if federal law enforcement had provided it , @entity30 testified			0
but the three officers he had assigned to @entity1 's @entity138 said later that they were never in the loop			0
' they tell me they received no word about that individual prior to the bombing , ' @entity30 told the committee			0
in the hearing , @entity116 @entity145 rep. @entity145 slammed federal law enforcement for failing to share information with authorities in @entity1 and @entity116 , where the @entity33 was aware the @entity35 brothers intended to detonate more bombs in @entity119			1
' the failure to share information is absolutely indefensible , ' said @entity145			1
@entity37 applauded the @entity1 police chief , but slammed the federal government for failing to share information with city and state authorities former @entity159 senator @entity37 , a former chair of the @entity160 , testified that @entity61 and the @entity33 should share a broader variety of information with state and local law enforcement agencies , calling them ' your first line of defense			1
' not sharing all the federal government 's information with @entity1 police , he said , was ' a serious and aggravating omission			1
' he called that lapse ' one of the most significant and painful takeaway lessons ' from the federal government 's response to the bombings .			2

finish line was ' area of increased vulnerability , ' report read
@entity1 police chief testified that the federal government *withheld* information about the @entity35 brothers
' the failure to share information is absolutely indefensible , ' said @entity116 rep. @entity145 of the brothers ' plans to bomb @entity119
