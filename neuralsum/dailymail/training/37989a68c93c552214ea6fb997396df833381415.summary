stations in cities like @entity2 and @entity3 are traditionally vast , cathedral like structures			0
however , a new proposal calls for trains to climb up the side of skyscrapers to form the first vertical stations			1
this would free up space in city centres , and allow passengers to be routed out of the station more effectively , its inventors say			0
the future of stations ? its inventors say the vertical station would free up space in major cities as the train travels close to the tower it transitions from its horizontal formation , and ascends up the facade vertically			1
the individual compartments pivot similar to a ‘ @entity28 ’ , allowing the passengers within the carriage to remain in an upright position and facing towards the cityscape			1
the carriages will be supported by a magnetic structure located at either side			0
this eliminates the need for rails beneath , and allowing the carriages and its passengers to connect to the tower			2
passengers will travel into the main lobby allowing travelers to ascend through the atrium and through the platforms and onto the carriages			0
called the @entity49 , it could replace stations with a giant skyscraper , according to @entity52 and @entity53 , the @entity54 who came up with the idea			0
train carriages pivot like a @entity28 when they approach , and magnets on the side of the building allow them to rise up			1
' the @entity49 , aims to resolve the inevitable challenges that cities will face by 2075 , and offers a deliverable and sustainable solution for the future of the transport generation , ' they say			0
the project will become a ‘ repeatable ’ piece of infrastructure that can be implemented to support any city around the world , connecting to a new @entity49 under and over ground network , with trains covering an average distance of 300miles in 30 minutes , they hope			2
the huge towers would be as large as the empire state building			0
called @entity49 , it could replace stations with a giant skyscraper			0
train carriages pivot like a @entity28 then they approach , and magnets on the side of the building allow them to rise up			1
' the @entity82 aims to replace existing flagship train stations and create new key connective points for the exchange of people and goods with the new hyper speed network			2
' the proposal will ‘ flip ’ the traditional form and function of the current train station design vertically , and re-form it into a cylindrical mass to increase the towers train capacity			2
the train tower aims to eliminate the current impact that traditional stations have currently on land use			1
passengers will travel into the main lobby allowing travelers to ascend through the atrium and through the platforms and onto the carriages			0
the base of the tower will become a park , with bridge to connect people to the station 's main lobby each carriage will contain ten passengers ' the trains will also create a dynamic and kinetic facade , one that will be continuously evolving and responsive to the workings of the vertical hub , a language that can be read by the whole city , ' the team say			1
as the train travels and transitions from its horizontal formation , and ascends up the facade vertically , the carriages will pivot similar to that on a ‘ @entity28 ’ , allowing the passengers within the carriage to remain in an upright position and facing towards the cityscape			1
the carriages will be supported by a magnetic structure located at either side , eliminating the need for rails beneath , and allowing the carriages and its passengers to connect to the tower .			2

trains are able pivot like a @entity28 as they reach tower
magnets will allow the train to rise up the tower
