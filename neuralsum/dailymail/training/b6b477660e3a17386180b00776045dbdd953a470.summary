by @entity0 he has presented @entity1 for 25 years			1
but to many , including prime minister @entity2 , @entity3 will forever be remembered best for his children ’s tv roles			1
mr @entity3 first found fame in the early seventies when he presented the @entity10 ’s first children ’s news programme @entity3 ’s @entity11			1
icon : @entity2 told former @entity11 presenter @entity3 ' i grew up on you ' when they met he was with the show from its inception in 1972 , even after it dropped his name until 1989			1
his subsequent ubiquity during the 70s and 80s on kids tv - also presenting items on other shows , such as @entity25 and @entity26 – appears to have left an indelible mark			2
the 73 - year - old @entity28 was awarded the obe in 2000 for services to rural and children ’s broadcasting , and the @entity33 in 2002			2
in 2011 , he accepted a children ’s @entity35 award for @entity11			1
he revealed : ‘ when i met @entity2 , he came straight up to me and said , ‘ i grew up on you			0
’ i thought , really ? am i that old ? ’ and it ’s not just the @entity41 , mr @entity3 adds : ‘ but i also remember being on a plane and a hostess approached me and said , ‘ i ’d just like to thank you for being part of my childhood			1
’ ” in 2009 , mr @entity3 ’s former colleague @entity47 , 57 , was sacked from @entity1 when the show moved to sunday evenings on @entity49			1

veteran : mr @entity3 ( left ) was an icon for children throughout the 1970s before he moved on to @entity1 asked whether she was right to sue the corporation , mr @entity3 replied : ‘ yes , if she felt that she ’d been badly treated then of course she was right to take them on			1
’ however , he insisted he was right not to get involved in the dispute himself , adding : ‘ it got very unpleasant and for the team it was an unhappy time			0
‘ i did n’t get involved because i ’m not management , i ’m just a hired hand			0
when you ’re in the front line as a presenter , the easiest thing for a new manager to do when they come in is get rid of you and bring in a new face and that ’s always been the case			2
‘ i ’m incredibly lucky because i ’ve survived about 12 different series producers on @entity1			1
’ mr @entity3 , who lives in a small village in @entity80 , said he thinks of himself as a ‘ country person ’ , but said : ‘ i know i ’ll never be fully accepted			1

’ in a wide - ranging interview with the @entity108 , mr @entity3 also warns a growing appetite for @entity111 food in @entity113 countries could create a shortage in this country			2
the 73 - year - old presenter said people in @entity118 and @entity119 increasingly like to eat the same foodstuffs as us , meaning we may find it hard to import what we need			2
and he urged the @entity124 to produce more of its own food instead of buying it from abroad			0
he said : ‘ food security is incredibly important now			0
we produce about 60 per cent of our own food ; we need to produce much more because the @entity113 countries , @entity118 and @entity119 especially , are wanting our kind of food now , particularly wheat and all the basics			0
‘ and whoever has the most money will get what they want			0
