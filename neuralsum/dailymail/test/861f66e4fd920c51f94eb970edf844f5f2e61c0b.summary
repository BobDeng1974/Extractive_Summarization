@entity0 came close to giving himself some extra preparation time for his wedding next week before ensuring that he still has unfinished tennis business to attend to			1
the world no 4 is into the semi-finals of the @entity6 , but not before getting a scare from 21 year - old @entity9 @entity8 , who pushed him to 4 - 4 in the second set before going down 3 - 6 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 in an hour and three quarters			1
@entity0 was awaiting the winner from the last eight match between @entity15 and @entity17 's @entity16			1
prior to this tournament @entity8 lost in the second round of a @entity21 event to soon - to - be new @entity23 @entity22			1
@entity0 pumps his first after defeating @entity8 to reach the @entity6 semi finals @entity25 throws his sweatband into the crowd after completing a 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 victory in @entity29 @entity0 shakes hands with @entity8 who he described as a ' strong guy ' after the game and @entity0 has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow @entity35 tennis players who might be agitated about his imminent arrival into the home ranks : do n't complain			1
instead the @entity35 no 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world number 83 , originally from @entity42 , as motivation to better themselves			1
at present any grumbles are happening in private , and @entity46 's present ineligibility for the @entity48 team has made it less of an issue , although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the @entity51			2
@entity0 thinks anyone questioning the move , now it has become official , would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his			1
' if he was 500 in the world they would n't be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit , ' said the 27 year - old @entity61			0
' and he 's obviously the @entity35 number two , comfortably			1
' so they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is , and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not			0
he 's @entity35 now so they 've just got to deal with it			1
@entity0 stretches for a return after starting his quarter final match slowly on the show court @entity8 held nothing back as he raced through the opening set , winning it 6 - 3 with a single break the young @entity9 is considered to be one of the hottest prospects on the @entity85 ' i would hope that all the guys who are below him now like @entity90 ( @entity89 ) , @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 ( @entity94 ) they will use it as motivation			1
if he becomes eligible for @entity48 then those guys are going to have to prove themselves			0
' it can only be seen as a positive for those guys using it to try to get better			0
he 's a good player but so are @entity90 and @entity91 and @entity93 has improved			0
@entity22 is there , he 's on the tour every week , the other guys are n't quite there yet			0
' for the first time @entity0 , who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100 , gave his opinion of @entity46 : ' he 's a good player with a very good serve			1
he 's a legitimate top 100 player , when he plays challengers he 's there or thereabouts , when he plays on the main tour he wins matches , it 's not like he turns up and always loses in the first round			2
@entity0 's fiancee was once again watching from the stands shaded by a huge brimmed hat @entity120 flashes her enormous diamond engagement ring while watching her beau on court ' he had a bad injury last year ( wrist ) but has recovered well			2
i would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings although i do n't know exactly how high he can go			0
i 've practised with him a couple of times , i have n't seen him play loads , but when you serve as well as he does it helps			2
i would imagine he ' s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while			0
' it is understood the @entity135 will give background support to his case regarding the @entity48 but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way			0
an official statement said : ' to have another player in the men 's top 100 is clearly a positive thing for @entity35 tennis and so we very much welcome @entity22 's change in citizenship			2
' the last comparable switch came twenty years ago when @entity151 arrived from @entity152			0
it was by no means universally popular but , like @entity46 , he pledged that he was in for the long haul and , in fairness to him , he proved true to his word			0
loising the first set shocked @entity0 into life as he raced to a commanding lead in the second the no 3 seed sent over a few glaring looks towards his team before winning the second set @entity0 had to put such matters aside as he tackled the unusually talented @entity8 , a delight to watch			1
coached by @entity170 's veteran mentor @entity169 , he slightly resembles @entity171 and hits with similar power but more elegance			0
his single handed backhand is a thing of rare beauty			0
however , he has had a mediocre season coming into this event and there was little to forewarn of his glorious shotmaking that seemed to catch @entity0 unawares early on			1
the world no 4 looked to have worked him out in the second , but then suffered one of his periopdic mental lapses and let him back in from 4 - 1 before closing it out with a break			2
after breaking him for 3 - 1 in the decider the @entity9 whirlwind burnt itself out			0
' he 's a strong guy who hits the ball hard and it became a very physical match , ' said @entity0			2
@entity0 was presented with a celebratory cake after winning his 500th match in the previous round			1

@entity35 no 1 defeated @entity8 in @entity6 quarter finals
@entity0 celebrated his 500th career win in the previous round
third seed will play the winner of @entity15 and @entity16 in the semi finals of the @entity205 event in @entity206
