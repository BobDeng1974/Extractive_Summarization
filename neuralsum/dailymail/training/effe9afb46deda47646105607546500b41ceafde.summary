from clumsily eating a bacon sandwich to posing in a ‘ feminist ’ t - shirt made by exploited female labour , @entity4 ’s public appearances during recent months have been a catalogue of gaffes			1
few of these moments have been more awkward than his spontaneous decision to give some loose change to a young beggar while he walked along a street in @entity14 last week			1
if this was an attempt to parade his decency , it backfired disastrously			2
instead of looking compassionate , he came across as foolish , opportunistic and embarrassed			2
@entity4 has also attracted criticism for the disdainful look on his face as he handed over the cash , as if he were repelled by his own action			1
yet that air of self - disgust was appropriate			2
for @entity4 knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing			1
the key problem was not the size of his donation , but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all			2
mr @entity24 's comments come after @entity51 leader @entity4 was pictured dropping money into a beggar 's cup outside @entity55 it ’s a familiar predicament when we ’re faced with another desperate - looking figure huddled on the street , palm outstretched			1
it ’s only human to feel that impulse to help — to give a few coins to alleviate another ’s misery — and , all too often , for that impulse to override the quiet voice which asks : am i really helping ? the answer is no. giving to a beggar might momentarily salve the donor ’s conscience , but in the longer term it does absolutely nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient			1
on the contrary , it locks the beggar in a downward spiral of abject dependency and victimhood , where all self - respect , honesty and hope are lost			2
indeed , by reinforcing the beggar ’s pitiable condition , a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness			1
if there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give , it is those who do			2
i should know , because i was a beggar for much of my early life			2
growing up in an @entity100 immigrant family in @entity101 with a father who made it his life ’s mission to single - handedly prop up the drinks trade , i first experienced homelessness at the age of five , and between the ages of seven and ten was raised in an orphanage , supplementing my meagre pocket money with what i could get on the streets			2
mr @entity24 says that reinforcing the beggar ’s pitiable condition , a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness begging descended into crime , and through my teenage years i was in and out of prison			1
but it was that background which gave me the determination to do something for the homeless beyond the usual mix of counter-productive financial concern and judicial punishment ( begging and rough - sleeping have been illegal here since the 16th century )			2
what i wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose			2
so , in 1991 , i came up with the idea of the @entity137 magazine , a product which people could sell for a decent profit			1
the @entity137 represented dynamic street trade , not degraded street aid			1
instead of remaining passive , dependent victims , the sellers would become active merchants , gaining discipline , self - worth and honesty			2
the initiative was widely adopted here and abroad , transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness			0
i am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work			0
the other day , i met up with an old mate called @entity155			0
more than 20 years ago , he was a real hard - case : an alcoholic drug - dealer who lived on the streets and had served time in prisons all over the world			0
mr @entity4 made his donation while walking through @entity14 with shadow transport secretary @entity163 , left , and @entity165 candidate @entity164 , right thanks to the self - respect the @entity137 gave him , he cleaned up his act , escaped his destructive habits and became a responsible adult			1
he is now a @entity171 specialist in drug and drink addictions , helping others to break free as he did			0
the alternative — embodied in @entity4 ’s desperate move — of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money , only worsens the begging problem			1
moreover , such an approach amounts to a collusion with criminality , for not only is begging illegal under a host of laws , such as the @entity187 , but it is often accompanied — as in @entity155 ’s example — by other law - breaking , like drug possession , theft , disorderly conduct , and even violence			0
so there is no doubt that giving to beggars worsens criminality by encouraging the destitute to remain outside the margins of society			1
most of the homeless are mentally ill or in the throes of addiction , so cash enables them to spend more on drink or drugs			0
alternatively , they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public ’s generosity			0
that is why i often say the @entity137 is a also ‘ crime reduction initiative ’ , because it helps to steer the magazine vendors away from the possibility of sliding into illegal behaviour			1
this is true even of the large number of @entity35 who now sell the @entity137 on @entity221 streets ; on my estimates , one in five of all @entity137 vendors is @entity224			1
now , understandably , many @entity221 people strongly object to this trend			0
why on earth are we , a small country with overstretched public services , importing destitution on such a scale from @entity224 ? the beggar was later revealed to be 14 - year - old @entity234 , who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to @entity35 that is a question not for the @entity137 organisation , but for the politicians such as @entity4 who opened the sluice gates and insisted , for ideological reasons , on open borders within @entity224			1
they are the ones who decided the @entity35 poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here			0
at least the @entity137 gives them work , an income , a roof over their heads and a route away from crime			1
but that does not mean i am blind to some of the excesses and abuses			0
unfortunately , thanks to the ill - conceived bureaucracy of the welfare system , some @entity261 and @entity35 have been allowed to exploit their positions as vendors to gain self - employed status , opening the way to a raft of income - related welfare benefits			0
that is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who mr @entity4 met in @entity14			1
@entity234 , 14 , lives with her aunt , @entity275 , in rented accommodation ; her parents have returned to @entity35 because of a family illness			0
as a ‘ self - employed ’ @entity137 seller six days a week , ms @entity275 can claim £ 550 a week in welfare			1
but again the @entity137 should not be the organisation under attack			1
it is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self - employed status and access to social security			0
this whole case shows the laxity of the authorities ’ approach			0
ms @entity275 might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self - employed individual , but she should certainly not be allowing her 14 - year - old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging			0
are social services and the police investigating ? if not , why not ? and why is @entity301 , still only a child , not in school or back with her parents ? mr @entity24 estimates that one in five people selling the @entity137 on the street are of @entity224 decent ( file picture ) i fear the answer is there is far too much sentimentality and cowardice in our political system , which has been ruthlessly exploited by society ’s parasites			1
i have absolutely no time for the pathetic , bleeding - heart mentality so prevalent these days — and which destroys traditional concepts of morality and justice			0
i firmly believe that anyone who breaks the law or abuses our generosity should be deported — not protected by the morally perverted human rights regime which allows them to remain in this country on the basis of their so - called ‘ right to a family life ’			0
indeed , early this year i led calls for the deportation of @entity333 , a @entity335 seller based in @entity101 who robbed a blind pensioner of £ 50 when she tried to pay him for the magazine			0
for this sickening crime , he was sentenced to just four months in prison			0
but it is the politicians who created this mess , through their contempt for our borders , reluctance to uphold our laws , and remorseless expansion of our welfare benefits			0
@entity4 ’s desperate donation is a classic illustration of warped priorities and lack of ethical rigour			1
he should be ashamed of himself .			0
