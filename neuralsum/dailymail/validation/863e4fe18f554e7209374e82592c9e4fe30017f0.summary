@entity0 finds himself with the task of killing off @entity2 in the @entity3 on sunday after @entity5 ’s scratch pair came tantalisingly close to doing the job for him			1
taking their cue from @entity13 ’s heroics on friday , @entity8 and @entity9 almost mimicked his comeback before going down 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 9 - 7 to the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , in another epic , this one lasting three hours and 39 minutes			1
it left @entity20 leading this @entity3 first - round match 2 - 1 with two to play , but it could so nearly have been all over as the @entity23 pair shocked the sport ’s most feared duo with the force of their comeback			1
@entity2 's @entity15 celebate after holding on to win the doubles rubber in their @entity3 clash @entity31 and @entity8 ( right ) battled back bravely from two sets down before losing decider 9 - 7 the @entity2 @entity35 brothers are the top ranked pairing in world doubles @entity23 no 1 @entity0 screams encouragement from the sidelines @entity9 and @entity0 put up superb resistance , spurred on by more passionate support			1
@entity9 was impressive from the start in only his second @entity3 tie while @entity8 recovered admirably from a terrible first two sets			1
by opting to rest @entity0 , gb captain @entity45 knew he could be sacrificing a doubles point , with the calculated trade - off that his no 1 player would be fresh for this afternoon ’s reverse singles			2
he will tackle @entity50 , whom he has beaten in all three meetings , and if he can extend that record , a home quarter - final will be secured against @entity54 , who have beaten @entity56			0
@entity9 plays a one - handed backhand to @entity20 's @entity2 opponents @entity17 and @entity35 on saturday the @entity35 brothers , representing @entity2 at the @entity3 , celebrate after winning a point against @entity5 @entity0 celebrates after winning a vital point against the @entity15 during his double 's match a buoyant @entity8 was confident his younger brother can finish it , partly due to superior team spirit			1
‘ it ’s pretty obvious we are a much tighter team than the @entity2 , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n’t feel the rest of their team were cheering much , while our guys were up on every point			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity50 will be back - flipping out of bed tomorrow to play @entity0			0
i guess with his serve he has a chance but i would n’t bet against @entity0 in this situation			0
’ so far this tie has uncannily mirrored last year ’s first round between the countries in @entity79 , when @entity0 sealed it in the fourth rubber after the @entity82 had reduced the deficit to 2 - 1 by the saturday night			2
@entity9 and @entity8 played together a few times as juniors but are unfamiliar as professionals			2
@entity35 plays a forehand shot as he attempts to win a point back for @entity2 in the @entity3 in @entity89 @entity0 watches on while his brother serves ( left ) and the @entity20 team discuss tactics ( right ) @entity17 and @entity35 of the @entity2 line up alongside @entity0 and @entity9 of @entity5 before the match in contrast the @entity82 are almost telepathic , having won 16 @entity97 titles			1
@entity35 had no complaints about the atmosphere but did point out that the @entity100 ramped up the music after the home team won a game , while playing ‘ a lullaby ’ when the @entity2 struck back			0
while @entity9 did not lose his serve throughout , @entity0 dropped his first four service games as they lost the first two sets before another massively committed crowd of nearly 8,000			0
once @entity0 had held early in the third he stepped his game up and they held on to take the set			0
@entity20 slipped behind 3 - 5 in the fourth - set tiebreak but after running off the next three points , @entity0 converted a volley on their second set point to take it 10 - 8 , having saved a match point at 7 - 8			2
the @entity2 bench started to look like death row as their banker pair struggled and the decider became desperately tight			0
but the older @entity0 brother could not hold on at 7 - 7 , and was broken , with @entity124 , ranked 38 in doubles , making several mistakes that belied his previous form			2
the @entity2 are still in with a chance of completing an unlikely comeback from 2 - 0 down but they have done that only once in 40 @entity3 ties , and @entity0 looks mightily up for the contest .			1

@entity15 beat @entity8 and @entity9 in five sets in @entity3
@entity20 went 2 - 0 down , but battled back to 2 - 2 before losing deciding set 9 - 7
@entity5 lead the @entity2 2 - 1 heading into the final singles rubbers
