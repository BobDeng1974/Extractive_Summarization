by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 23 may 2013 when someone overweight claims to eat healthily and exercise but sill ca n't shift the pounds , it can be difficult to believe them			1
but that is just the situation @entity9 found herself in after doctors said her almost permanent bloating and excessive weight was down to @entity13			1
fortunately @entity14 did not give up the fight to find a diagnosis and , on a colleague 's advice , sought a food intolerance test - and found the real reason behind her size			1
@entity23 manager @entity22 , 26 , says : ' i had always been quite curvy , but over the last few years i had noticed my weight just kept creeping up , so i decided to do something about it			2
' she started eating much healthier , sticking to five small meals a day with a mixture of lean protein and lots of vegetables and salads			0
but @entity22 struggled to shift much of her uncomfortable 14st weight			1
doctors said @entity14 's incessant bloating and excessive weight was down to @entity13 ' i also joined a gym and started working out three times a week			1
i noticed that some of the weight came off , but it just seemed really slow and i was n't seeing the results i was expecting considering how healthily i was eating and how much effort i was putting in at the gym			2
' i was also constantly bloated every time i 'd eat which was causing me a lot of pain and discomfort , not to mention left me feeling i felt embarrassed			0
' months of healthy eating and exercise were proving to have little effect , especially on my stomach area which remained stubbornly bloated			2
' i became quite anxious about the situation and so i went to see my gp			0
he was n't very helpful and just told me to carry on as i was , telling me that the bloating was probably just @entity13 and that the weight would fall off eventually			1
' in desperation i tried a radical diet that involved eating mainly raw carrots and houmous at lunch , but again this proved to have little effect			2
' it was then that a colleague suggested that i might have a food intolerance and recommended that i try a food intolerance test			1
@entity14 was able to shed those stubborn excess pounds she 'd been trying so hard to get rid of ' when the results came back they revealed that i had intolerances to a number of the ' healthy ' foods i 'd been munching for the past few months - including carrots ! ' ' cutting these from my diet had an almost instantaneous effect			1
within days my stomach was noticeably flatter and my @entity13 symptoms had greatly reduced			2
' ' as well as carrots , i also found out that i am intolerant to cow 's milk and yeast			1
i have cut these completely from my diet			2
three months later i am still sticking to my new diet			2
the @entity87 intolerance test made @entity22 change her eating habits immediately and while she carries on with her healthy diet from before , she has had to find alternatives to her reactive foods : carrots , cow 's milk and yeast			1
' i eat quite a lot of stir - fried vegetables as i find just boiled veg can be quite dull			0
where before i 'd always throw in some carrots , now i 've replaced this with other veg such as courgettes			0
' as i 've completely cut out cow 's milk , i now use almond and soya milk for smoothies and soups			1
' wine contains yeast so i have also replaced my usual white wine for spirits			0
i 'll go for a g&t now instead of a glass of wine			0
' i also steer clear of using dressings and sauces because they can contain yeast too			0
i 've stopped using soya sauce when i make stir - fry as i 've struggled to find a yeast - free version			0
' in the months that followed @entity14 was able to shed the stubborn excess pounds she had been trying so hard to get rid of			0
' i do n't yet have a boyfriend but i am dating			0
i did n't feel confident about dating before but i do much more now			0
also i 'm much more confident on holiday and in summer clothes - i can finally enjoy clothes shopping now whereas before i would avoid it , ' she said			0
she now weighs in at a svelte 9st 7lbs , losing well over 4st , and wears a size 12 - three sizes down from her peak at size 18			0
' it feels like my entire life has changed ' , she says			0
' i would n't go back to my old diet and i 'll make sure i never have trigger foods again ... i 've gone cold turkey			2
' recent research suggests a direct correlation between food intolerance and weight gain			1
last year 's @entity144 research entitled : eliminating @entity145 from the @entity146 and its effect on @entity147 and @entity148 in @entity149 found that by simply cutting trigger foods out of your diet , the battle of the bulge could be over			1
' cutting carrots , cow 's milk and yeast had an almost instant effect and within days my stomach was flatter ' breakfast : porridge or a smoothie for breakfast ( strawberry , banana and blueberry with some natural live yogurt ) lunch : carrots and reduced fat hummus ( which she later learned was no good for her ) dinner : chicken with stir fried vegetables ( onions , mushrooms , bean sprouts , carrots , peppers ) , salmon and salad , omelette ( usually using skimmed milk ) breakfast : @entity187 ( strawberry , blueberries , banana and soya or almond milk ) lunch : soup ( homemade potato and leek or root vegetable minus carrots and using dairy - free cream ) dinner : omelette minus milk , jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn , chicken with vegetables ( broccoli , cauliflower ) with even seemingly healthy foods such as lettuce having the potential to cause a reaction , the study shows it could be beneficial to find out your own personal triggers			1
the research assessed the effect that @entity219 food sensitivity tests and the subsequent elimination of trigger foods for a period of 90 days had on the body composition and quality of life of 120 overweight people			1
the results showed that the subjects who eliminated the foods they reacted to ' had reductions in weight , body mass index , waist and hip circumferenceâ € ¦ and all indicators of quality of life '			1
' food intolerance is a serious issue and is often misdiagnosed			1
i meet numerous clients who consistently eat healthy and exercise regularly but still find it hard to shift those last few pounds			0
' food intolerances can cause an immune response in the body which can lead to weight gain or difficulty in losing weight ' nutritionist , @entity247			1
dr. @entity249 , scientific director at @entity87 , explains : ' a stressed digestive system is less able to process energy and nutrients for the rest of the body			0
it will also be less able to repel harmful invaders and may be more prone to disorders such as @entity13			2
' once the immune response is triggered in the body , it feels that it is under siege thus hoarding supplies , storing fluid and increasing weight			0

@entity267 , 26 , ate healthily but was bloated and overweight
@entity270 *blamed* her 14st weight on @entity13 and said to carry on as *normal*
@entity274 recommended she try food intolerance testing
discovered she reacted badly to carrots , yeast and cow 's milk
cut foods from diet and *slimmed* three dress sizes in three months
research shows cutting reaction foods result in ' reductions in weight , body mass index , waist and hip circumference '
