labour leader @entity10 said mr @entity2 would go down in history as the first prime minister ‘ who brought a criminal into the heart of @entity16 ’			1
during furious exchanges in the @entity18 , mr @entity2 insisted the @entity20 inquiry had made no criticism of his conduct and dismissed @entity24 ’s ‘ cooked up conspiracy ’ of a deal between the @entity27 party and @entity29 ’s media empire			1
@entity4 was yesterday found guilty of plotting to hack phones while he was editor of the tabloid newspaper			2
at prime minister ’s questions , mr @entity2 repeated his apology for hiring @entity4 , for which he took ‘ full responsibility ’			1
‘ i did so on the basis of assurances that i received but also the select committee received			0
‘ but i always said that if those assurances turned out to be wrong i would apologise fully and frankly to this @entity50 and i do so again today from this despatch box			0
this was the wrong decision			0
’ he said @entity4 ’s conviction showed that ‘ no - one is above the law in our country ’			0
but mr @entity10 stepped up his attacks on mr @entity2 , claiming he ignored warnings from newspaper reports and even deputy prime minister @entity61 , not to allow mr @entity4 to work in the government			1
mr @entity10 accused mr @entity2 of being ‘ weak ’ for ‘ failing to stand up for doing the right thing ’			1
but mr @entity2 shot back : ‘ i ’ll tell you what is weak , attacking @entity29 , and then standing up with a copy of the @entity68 newspaper , only to apologise a few hours later			0
’ mr @entity10 was ridiculed last week after posing for a publicity photo holding a promotional copy of @entity68 , but later faced criticism from @entity73 mps and activists angered by the newspaper ’s coverage of the @entity78 disaster			0
commons speaker @entity79 had to intervene several times amid loud heckling from both sides in the @entity18			0
mr @entity10 accused the mr @entity2 of being ' weak ' and claimed the charge against the prime minister ' is not one of ignorance it is wilful negligence ' mr @entity2 repeatedly turned to the report of the @entity20 inquiry into media ethics to show that he had been cleared of behaving improperly the prime minister claimed @entity24 was refusing to accept the findings of the @entity20 inquiry because they believed a ' cooked - up conspiracy between the conservatives and @entity95 ' veteran @entity27 minister @entity96 today claimed @entity2 had been ' unwise ' to speak out over the @entity4 verdict while the phone - hacking trial was still going on			1
the remarks , which will infuriate the prime minister , came after he was rebuked by a top judge			2
the @entity83 apologised on tuesday for employing @entity4 , saying it had been the ' wrong decision '			2
but mr justice @entity103 said his intervention was ' unsatisfactory ' and set a bad example to the media			0
today mr @entity96 said : ' it was unwise and they should have taken some legal advice first , but i doubt whether it ever crossed @entity2 ’s mind			0
' it would only have crossed mine because i have a historic background as a lawyer and there obviously was n’t a lawyer sitting around when they decided			0
' when they were being pressed , of course , by the public and the press to give comments on the news that had come out			0
' but the prime minister 's official spokesman today rejected mr @entity96 's claim and confirmed the @entity83 had sought legal advice before commenting			1
the spokesman said : ' yes he did seek the attorney general 's advice			0
' mr @entity10 : ‘ today we know that for four years , the prime minister ’s handpicked closest advisor was a criminal and brought disgrace to @entity16			1
‘ we now also know that the prime minister wilfully ignore multiple warnings about him			2
’ he said that in july 2009 the @entity140 published evidence of ‘ phone hacking on an industrial scale while @entity4 was editor of the @entity145 ’			1
in may 2010 , the deputy prime minister ‘ warned him in person about his deep concerns about @entity4 ’ , mr @entity10 said			1
in september 2010 the @entity149 published a front page investigation ‘ detailing @entity4 ’s extensive knowledge of phone - hacking , including one former editor who said “ i ’ve been to dozens if not hundreds of meetings with @entity4 , where the subject came up ”			2
’ he also claimed former cabinet secretary sir @entity155 raised concerns about the deicion to bring mr @entity4 into @entity16 mr @entity10 said the failure to heed the warnings raised doubts about mr @entity2 ’s character and judgement			1
‘ when it came to @entity4 he just did n’t want to know the evidence , ’ he added			0
but mr @entity2 said all of the issues raised about been examined in detail by the @entity20 inquiry ordered in the wake of the hacking scandal , and did not criticise him			1
‘ every single one of these issues was dealt with by the @entity20 inquiry			1
the terms of reference of the @entity176 were agreed by [ @entity10 ] and they included the extent to which there was failure to act on previous warnings about media misconduct			0
‘ that is what @entity20 looked into , he looked into all of these questions about the warnings i was given and the response i gave , and he made no criticism of my conduct			2
‘ now i know that he was disappointed by the @entity176 , but he called for it , it took place and he should heed what it said			0
’ commons speaker @entity79 had to intervene several times amid loud heckling from both sides mr @entity10 also raised questions about the level of security vetting carried out on mr @entity4 when he joined the government			1
‘ amidst all of those warnings the very least he should have done is insisted immediately on coming to office that @entity4 should have the highest level of security vetting , as his six predecessors over the previous 14 years have had			0
why did n’t he insist on it ? ‘ we know the rule of this prime minister is the buck does n’t stop here , and he blames the civil service			2
’ mr @entity10 went on : ‘ there is now a very important question which the whole country will want an answer to about whether sir @entity155 or senior civil servants raised concerns with him or his office about @entity4			1
‘ the truth about this is the charge against the prime minister is not one of ignorance it is wilful negligence			2
‘ at the heart of this scandal are thousands of innocent victims of phone hacking he did n’t stand up for			0
‘ the prime minister will always be remembered as being the first ever occupant of his office who brought a criminal into the heart of @entity16			2
’ mr @entity2 , pictured leaving @entity16 this morning , faced repeated questions about judgement but mr @entity2 said the @entity20 inquiry ‘ looked directly at this issue ’ and found that ‘ the level of security was not the decision of either mr @entity2 or mr @entity4 , it was the decision of the civil service ’			1
he claimed @entity24 was ‘ desperate ’ not to talk about the state of the economy or unemployment , but mr @entity10 ‘ ca n’t re-run an inquiry that has already taken place ’			1
‘ what [ mr @entity10 ] is trying to do is go through all of the old questions , that were answered by the @entity176 , he did n’t like the answer because he wanted to try and prove some cooked - up conspiracy between the conservatives and @entity95			2
‘ he can not manage to do it because the @entity20 inquiry ca n’t find it			1
‘ he brought up the issue of the warning form the @entity140 ; i totally disproved him using the evidence			0
he brought up the idea of direct vetting ; i have totally disproved him by using the evidence			0
‘ he can not bare the fact that an eight month inquiry that he hoped was going to pin the blame on me found that i had behaved correctly throughout			0
