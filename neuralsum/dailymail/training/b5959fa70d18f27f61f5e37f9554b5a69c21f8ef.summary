by @entity0 another day , another problem to address for @entity2 and their imperilled manager @entity3			1
this time it was stories — quickly denied — of a falling - out with one of his coaches , @entity7			2
the @entity2 icon — so the rumour went — vented his spleen at @entity3 in the @entity14 dressing room in the wake of sunday ’s limp defeat by @entity17			1
‘ @entity7 is absolutely fuming over suggestions of a falling - out with the manager , ’ said a @entity2 spokesman on monday			1
video : scroll down for @entity3 and @entity23 speaking ahead of wednesday 's @entity25 tie it never rains but it pours : @entity3 was forced to deny rumours that he had a bust - up with @entity7 in the wake of sunday 's home defeat to @entity17 all smiles : @entity3 and @entity7 appeared to be getting along fine as @entity2 trained on tuesday morning ahead of their @entity25 tie with @entity34 at @entity14 @entity35 : @entity36 laughs with @entity7 as he rolls on the floor during training at @entity39 when will the misery end ? @entity3 cut a forlorn figure on the @entity2 bench as they slumped to a 3 - 0 home defeat by @entity17 on sunday holding his hand up ? @entity3 potentially has 10 days to save his job at @entity14 ca n't watch : @entity7 was an unused substitute against @entity17 as it turned out , @entity7 was jogging on the pitch with other unused players when @entity3 and his team began their dissection of sunday ’s disaster			1
even the @entity53 ca n’t argue down the length of a players ’ tunnel and through a brick wall			0
as one fire goes out , however , other burning problems do not go away for @entity3			0
fresh from sunday ’s 3 - 0 surrender to @entity17 , @entity3 must raise his team for wednesday ’s @entity25 visit of @entity34			1
then , on saturday , is a visit to @entity64 in the @entity65 followed by the arrival of @entity67 next tuesday			0
if it sounds daunting for @entity3 , that ’s because it is			0
in the directors ’ box on sunday , @entity2 officials looked on aghast as the team succumbed meekly , while in the corporate lounges , guests from each of the club ’s top sponsors — invited especially for the day — must have wondered what the champions have been spending their money on			1
the official line from @entity2 is that @entity3 remains in no immediate danger			1
the plan , we are told , remains a long - term one			0
the @entity2 manager , though , is in trouble , do not think otherwise , and a succession plan may well be put in place within 10 days if things continue to go badly			1
long walk : @entity3 reflects on another disappointing defeat by @entity17 as his troubles continue disaster : @entity2 's player trudge back to the centre circle after @entity100 scores @entity17 's first goal from the penalty spot at @entity14 @entity36 said sunday ’s 3 - 0 defeat was ‘ one of the worst days i ’ve ever had in football ’			1
but @entity36 has not had a good day at @entity14 in a while			0
the last time he scored there was on october 26			0
since then , 22 players have scored at @entity14 : @entity2 : @entity109 ( 4 ) , @entity110 ( 3 ) , @entity111 ( 3 ) , @entity112 ( 2 ) , @entity113 ( 2 ) , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118			1
opponents : @entity100 ( @entity17 , 2 ) @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , @entity124 ( @entity64 ) , @entity125 , @entity126 ( @entity127 ) , @entity128 , @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , @entity133 , @entity134 ( @entity135 ) , @entity136 ( @entity17 )			0
on social networking sites and fan forums on monday , the groundswell of opinion against @entity3 continued to grow			1
even the more rational are beginning to tire of @entity2 ’s insipid football and a manager who rarely seems to say or do anything to inspire confidence in his ability to reverse a downward trend			0
however , the remarkable and prolonged support afforded @entity2 from the @entity150 during the last 10 minutes of sunday ’s defeat has worked in @entity3 ’s favour			1
it was noted by the @entity14 directors as a tick in a column of positives that was looking as empty as some of @entity2 ’s performances			2
what is abundantly clear is that nobody at @entity2 — apart from the odd disaffected player — wants to see @entity3 sacked			2
what is also apparent , however , is that @entity2 will have to get rid of him if things do n’t improve quickly			2
as @entity2 fans and officials stare down the @entity168 at their resurgent @entity170 rivals , they can comfort themselves with the fact that , while @entity17 remain a big and important football club , @entity2 have grown into an international financial monster			2
as such , the defending champions are in a position to throw millions of pounds at their problems this summer			0
the only question is whether they can — or should — trust @entity3 to spend it			0
@entity3 ’s @entity2 have a shambolic look about them and they are getting worse			2
other @entity65 coaches talk privately of unimaginative tactics and square pegs in round holes			0
and the rumours may not be true , but it nevertheless remains the case that @entity7 has appeared to be a rather distant , detached figure at @entity14 of late			1
support : it appears @entity3 is not getting the backing he needs from either the players or the fans hurting : @entity7 is said to be upset by @entity2 's slump and there has even been suggestion he could replace @entity3 as manager unveiled as part of the new world order when @entity3 succeeded sir @entity200 last may , the 40 - year - old has been increasingly less visible on the touchline and indeed as a player as crisis has followed crisis at @entity14			1
one theory is that @entity7 may yet be the next @entity2 manager — temporarily or otherwise — and is merely biding his time			2
that , though , does n’t fit with what we know of a loyal @entity2 servant who , rather like his friend @entity211 , takes every defeat , at whatever level , as a personal affront			0
schooled at @entity215 , @entity39 and @entity14 , @entity7 knows that success comes in cycles			2
he has n’t seen much like this during his 23 years at first - team level , though			0
dressing - room arguments — real or invented — pale into insignificance when the team are 18 points from the top of the @entity65 .			0

@entity3 has three vital matches in next week to hang on to his job
' succession plan ' may be put in place in next 10 days if things go badly
@entity7 ' fuming ' at suggestions of a fall - out with @entity2 boss
groundswell of fans ' opinion against @entity3 continues to grow
however @entity150 's support of team on sunday in @entity3 's favour
@entity7 now looks a rather *detatched* figure at @entity14
