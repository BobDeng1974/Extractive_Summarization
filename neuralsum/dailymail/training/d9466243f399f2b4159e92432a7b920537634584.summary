dozens of women have already had further treatment after @entity2 left small amounts of breast tissue around the cleavage of some of his patients - with the intention of giving them a ‘ better cosmetic result ’			1
the scandal is amounting to one of the most expensive for the health service as it faces a multi-million pound legal bill			1
around 700 women were believed to have been affected when the surgeon was stopped from operating in july 2011			0
but it emerged today that a total of 1,079 former patients of mr @entity2 were investigated by the hospital amid fears that he could have carried out more ' cleavage sparing ' procedures and put more women at risk			1
the former consultant of @entity40 in the @entity41 , who also worked privately in the @entity41 , is currently under investigation by medical regulators and the police			2

other payments have been made amounting to around £ 18,000			0
@entity78 officers have been called in to investigate whether the surgeon committed fraud by carrying out unnecessary private procedures , and whether he benefited financially from them			0
according to data drawn up by the @entity83 , the official monitoring body , of the women treated by mr @entity2 at @entity40 , 237 were found to definitely have ' excessive breast tissue ' left over after their operations			1

medical notes showed that the 379 women medical notes indicated that it was possible that there was potential for excessive breast tissue			2
of the remaining patients , 152 had a complete mastectomy			0
it is understood that dozens of women have already been received additional treatment which was identified as being needed as their cases were reviewed			2
concerns : staff at @entity40 alerted managers to the conduct of mr @entity2 as early as 2004 but no action was taken for years staff at the hospital are said to have alerted managers with concerns about mr @entity2 as early as 2004 , but no action was taken until 2007			1
mr @entity2 — who also worked at two private clinics — @entity116 in @entity117 and @entity118 in @entity40 — was then told by @entity119 , which runs @entity40 , to stop using the ' cleavage sparing ' method			1

i thought mr @entity2 had saved my life			1
so to be told that in fact the cancer could still be there was absolutely devastating			0
' the 66 - year - old , who needed a full mastectomy in july 2010 after discovering that mr @entity2 had only removed part of her breast tissue , said her faith in the health service and medicine has been severely shaken by his behaviour and by that of @entity10 managers , who failed to stop mr @entity2 operating on hundreds more women			1
@entity122 has admitted liability in her case			0
the report will be the result of an investigation by sir @entity149 , who led an inquiry into the scandal of deaths at the @entity154 babies ’ heart unit			2

dr @entity174 said : ' i very much regret what has happened to so many women , and our thoughts are with them and their families			0
we are doing everything we can to offer support through what is a most difficult time for them			0
' there is no doubt that mistakes have been made in the past , and this is why since i came into post , have focused on what the patients and staff have been telling us to identify fully what happened and to take every possible action to prevent this from happening again			0
' i have requested an independent review led by sir @entity199			0
i expect sir @entity149 ’s , report to provide clarity around the specific areas that need to be addressed , and we have committed to this report being made public when it is presented which we believe will be in the next few weeks			2
we will respond swiftly and positively to sir @entity149 ’s , findings and recommendations			2
he added that all the women who had had mastectomies had been contacted in writing and that he and other members of the @entity214 's senior team had met with some of the women concerned and their families			0
