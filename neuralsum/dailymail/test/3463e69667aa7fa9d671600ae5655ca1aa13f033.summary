officially it 's known as a ' forward three - and - a - half somersaults with one twist pike ' but unofficially it 's the ' firework ' and @entity4 hopes it 's the dive that turns @entity7 bronze into @entity9 gold			1
the former world champion knows he needs to push the boundaries of his sport and spent most of last year battling to master his ' demon ' dive , a dizzying combination of somersaults and twists he had hoped would prove the difference			1
however , along with new coach @entity20 he spent the winter modifying a new plunge , something that has never been attempted before			0
@entity4 spent long hours on the trampoline perfecting technique before building the dive in stages from different heights			1
@entity4 hopes his new ' firework ' dive can help win @entity30 gold at the 2016 @entity31 it was painstaking and detailed work but the dive finally got its premiere at the @entity36 and was part of @entity4 's repertoire when he won silver , with a personal best score , at the recent @entity41 in @entity42			1
' there was a sense of relief when we decided to bin the old dive but the pressure was on to come up with something , ' admitted @entity4			1
' the old dive did terrify me and while i did conquer my demons with it , it 's a weight off my shoulders that i 've moved on because it was a bad dive for me			2
' we wanted to do the least twist possible because i hate the twisting part			0
we 've only got one twist in this dive so we had to decide whether we were going to do it at the beginning or at the end because you can do that dive three different ways			2
' we tried doing it at the beginning but it made the dive really hard because the g - force getting into your pike shape is really difficult			1
' we go through 20 gs of force as we 're spinning around so at the end we decided to do it on the way out			0
so you spin as fast as you can and then you come out at the end , do one twist then land in the water			0
' @entity4 ( right ) has spent the winter modifying the plunge with his new coach @entity20 it 's six years since @entity4 won his breakthrough world title in @entity83 , one year after making his @entity30 debut as a 14 - year old in @entity86			1
last year there were inaccurate reports that @entity4 was to call time on his diving career but he insists he 's enjoying the sport more than ever , following the decision to relocate from @entity93 to @entity7			1
his home pool is now the @entity30 pool , a place with happy memories , and he 'll be the star attraction at next month 's @entity99 , 1 - 3 may in his newly - adopted hometown			1
but @entity4 is no longer the sole standard bearer for @entity104 diving , @entity101 became the first @entity106 diver to win on the @entity99 this year in @entity42 and @entity107 and synchro partner @entity108 are also established among the world 's elite			1
' i have never loved diving as much as i do now and i want to stay in diving for as long as i possibly can , ' added @entity4			2
the 20 - year - old says he is enjoying diving more than ever after relocating from @entity93 to @entity7 ' with the move to @entity7 it has become exciting again			2
especially with the new dive , there are new challenges and new obstacles to overcome			0
' it 's been great having @entity20 on board , we 've had a year and three months working together now			2
' there 's little things that we 've changed â€“ the strength and conditioning , the way that we work in the pool , the way we work in the gym but it 's really working out			0
' @entity104 diving is the strongest it 's ever been and we are all really excited about coming back to @entity7 and competing in our own pool			0
' we know in @entity7 that we always get a crowd that 's loud			0
it 's normally a sell - out and the atmosphere is a bit more electric than anyone else , it gives you that extra adrenaline rush and , in theory , it should get us to dive a little bit better			1
' and @entity4 hopes his new dive will bring victory at next month 's @entity99 in @entity7 but @entity4 's key ambition for the season in this summer 's @entity149 in @entity150			1
since striking gold in @entity83 , he has settled for a fifth and sixth at the event , a record he concedes must change			0
his rivals will be the normal suspects , reigning champion @entity156 , @entity30 champion @entity157 and @entity159 's @entity158			0
' the build up to @entity9 is going pretty well , ' he added			0
' it 's got a lot of competitions leading up to it and the worlds will be our first chance to qualify			0
' @entity7 is one of the key parts of the diving calendar this year because it 's the middle part of the @entity99			0
so it 's a really good marker to see how the new dive 's going and how all of that is piecing together and it 's exactly the half - way mark competition wise so i 'm really looking forward to it			1
' see @entity4 in the @entity99 , may 1 - 3 at the @entity180			2
