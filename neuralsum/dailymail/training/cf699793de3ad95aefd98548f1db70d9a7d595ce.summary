by @entity0 under threat : @entity2 used its first annual financial results announcement to warn that prices may have to rise @entity2 could be forced to increase the price of stamps unless the ‘ unfettered ’ rollout of rival postmen by @entity9 is brought under control , it was feared last night			1
it warned that @entity9 ’s growth ‘ could threaten the fundamental economics of the universal service ’ – the rule that requires @entity2 to deliver six days a week to every address in @entity16			1
deliveries have to cost the same whether a letter goes to @entity20 or @entity21			0
retaining this service was a key factor in @entity2 ’s sell - off last year			1
when it was floated in october , ministers insisted the universal service was protected by law			2
but @entity2 chose the announcement of its first annual financial results as a private company to warn that the requirement was under threat because the firm was losing business to its competitors			2
@entity9 is not bound by the universal service and does not have to deliver everywhere in @entity16			1
@entity2 said this means it can ‘ cherry pick ’ lucrative deliveries and locations – only handling business post to large cities such as @entity42			1
within three years , @entity9 ’s expansion could cost @entity2 more than £ 200million a year in lost business , it said			1
this would have to be recouped , leading to fears that the price of a stamp could rise – raising the prospect of £ 1 for first - class deliveries			0
a first - class stamp already costs 62p , up from 30p in 2005			0
@entity9 , which was launched in 2012 , can avoid the unprofitable deliveries @entity2 legally has to make			1
@entity9 can ' cherry pick ' lucrative deliveries and locations rather than keep universal prices across @entity16 it says its 3,000 orange - liveried postmen could be serving more than 40 per cent of @entity16 households by 2018			1
around 70 per cent of business letters , such as bank statements and gas bills , are now handled by one of @entity2 ’s rivals			2
@entity2 chief executive @entity63 yesterday called on postal regulator @entity64 to investigate @entity9 ’s cherry - picking of what she called easy - to - serve urban areas			1
she added : ‘ we do not believe the current situation serves the best interests of consumers			0
i ’ve still got to have that postman on that walk whether he has got two items to deliver or 2,002			0
‘ without timely intervention from the regulator , direct delivery competition will have a serious impact on the sustainability of the universal service			2
’ part of the sell - off deal was the requirement that all letters would cost the same across the country but @entity64 said : ‘ we do not believe there is presently a threat to the financial sustainability of the universal postal service			1
’ it announced plans for a review in march last year , although it will not take place until the end of 2015			0
@entity2 insists it should take place immediately			0
@entity9 chief executive @entity96 said : ‘ it ’s time to stop complaining and get on with promoting the postal sector in spite of the trend towards digital communications			0
’ the row comes as @entity2 revealed it was making profits before tax equal to around £ 1million a day			0
it delivers 58million letters and parcels daily , with plans to trial the delivery of parcels on a sunday this summer			0
yesterday , its shares fell 9.7 per cent to close at £ 5.19 – the biggest faller in the ftse index of @entity16 ’s top 100 firms – amid fears about the threat posed by @entity9			2
it floated at £ 3.30 .			0

key factor in last year sell off was that all letters would cost the same
but @entity2 warns competitors are putting that promise under threat
@entity9 is not bound by the universal service , can ' cherry pick ' deliveries
