@entity0 has appeared to hit back in the battle for control at @entity3 after @entity5 executive @entity4 was appointed finance director at @entity7			1
@entity4 , who is head of brands at @entity0 's sportswear firm , has been acting as a consultant at @entity3 since late october but his appointment to the board was confirmed on monday evening			1
the appointment came hours after the club announced they had secured a £ 500,000 loan from football club chairman @entity16 to provide working capital in the coming days			1
sports direct executive @entity4 has been appointed as the new finance director at @entity7 @entity0 's influence appeared to be on the wane after the @entity22 rejected his attempts to increase his shareholding from nine to almost 30 per cent			1
the @entity26 owner and @entity3 also face @entity22 disciplinary action relating to his dual interests and the fact that @entity30 had to loan the club urgently - needed money suggested the @entity33 might be prepared to step back			2
but the appointment of @entity4 , who joins former @entity26 managing director @entity35 on the board , shows @entity0 is prepared to fight back against competition from @entity38 and the so - called @entity39 , who snapped up almost a third of shares in the club in separate deals last week			1
the move also comes after the emergence of interest from @entity47 banker @entity46 , the owner of the @entity49 basketball team , whose approach to the club was confirmed in a statement to the stock exchange on monday morning			0
but his interest preceded the share purchases of the four @entity3 - supporting businessmen and the club needs a new influx of cash quickly			2
@entity0 owns @entity26 and also has a stake in @entity61 giants @entity3 the precarious nature of their finances was laid bare in details over @entity67 's interest - free loan , which @entity3 revealed was secured on transfer money due from @entity70 's move to @entity71 on friday for a reported £ 1million fee			1
the sale of the 20 - year - old @entity75 squad player had angered @entity3 fans given he has been one of the most highly - rated young players to emerge from @entity79 , and the desperate need for the cash was apparent when the statement announced that @entity30 's loan would be used for ' general working capital purposes over the next few days '			2
@entity3 , who borrowed £ 3m from @entity0 late last year , have previously stated their need to recoup the vast majority of the £ 8.3m losses made last season			1
there were claims that @entity67 's money had prevented @entity3 being wound up due to an overdue national insurance bill , but it is understood the @entity95 is satisfied that there was no default that breached its rules on reporting tax debts			2
rangers are soon due money from the £ 200,000 transfer of @entity103 to @entity104 and @entity106 chairman @entity105 revealed he had been sent a reminder by the @entity7 club			1
but the club appears to be in dire need of a major influx of cash soon and it is unclear how they will get it despite plans for a share issue			0
@entity3 shareholder @entity30 is pictured taking his seat @entity118 's @entity117 last month @entity0 is unable to increase his stake - if he sticks to the @entity22 agreement - and @entity122 's offer of investment would probably only succeed if he managed to independently snap up a major amount of shares in what would likely be a time - consuming and expensive exercise			1
his approach to the club appears to have been predicated on the possibility of shareholders voting to accept allowing him an exclusive share deal - but a similar resolution was heavily defeated at the club 's annual general meeting on december 22			0
rangers said his approach ' may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company '			0
@entity38 and the @entity39 - @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 - together own about 35 per cent of shares , although they stress they are not working as a group			0
but a consortium including @entity38 and the two @entity149 saw a £ 16m investment offer rejected by the @entity3 board in late october in favour of @entity0 's intervention , which saw him strengthen his already tight grip on the club 's retail division			1
the @entity39 also offered £ 6.5m to underwrite the planned share issue just before they each snapped up shares			0
@entity3 chairman @entity159 ( left ) and non-executive director @entity35 ( right ) it is understood that @entity46 has had tentative talks with the @entity39 but it is unclear whether he would welcome being a member of a consortium			2
and the bitter nature of the battle for boardroom power continued when @entity38 hit back at claims that @entity67 had come to the club 's rescue			0
@entity171 , spokesman for @entity30 and his brother @entity172 , who is a @entity3 plc director , said : ' once again @entity30 has stepped up to the plate with this half - million pound loan from his own pocket			2
' whilst we welcomed the recent share purchases by @entity38 and @entity141 and his consortium , this unfortunately did not put any funds into the club			0
' @entity30 was the only option for this cash injection at such short notice			0
the @entity30 family remain totally committed to achieving a satisfactory financial future for @entity3 and they hope all parties can work together in the future with that common goal			0
' in response , @entity38 told the @entity192 : ' given that @entity16 rejected new funds and was a chief architect in getting the club into this mess , lending a small amount of money is the minimum he should have done			0
as part restitution he should make the £ 500,000 a donation rather than a loan			1
' @entity47 financier @entity46 had submitted an £ 18million offer for a controlling stake in @entity3			0
