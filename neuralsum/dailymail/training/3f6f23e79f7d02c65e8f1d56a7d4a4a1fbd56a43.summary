@entity6 , which sits atop @entity7 on @entity8 , @entity9 , is made up of three crater lakes			1

visitors are never quite sure what colour the lakes will be when they reach the top due to the chemical reactions that take place in the water			1
nature 's easel : these three lakes sitting atop @entity7 on @entity8 , @entity9 have baffled scientists for centuries - as they spontaneously change colour considered by locals as the resting place of departed souls , each lake is known by a separate names - @entity36 ( @entity38 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 and @entity41 ) and @entity42 ( @entity35 )			2
the @entity38 is usually blue , while the other two lakes , @entity43 , are separated by a shared crater wall and are typically green or red			0
however , the lakes have been known to turn black and even white due to chemical reactions which take place			1
although the three lakes sit side by side on the crest of the same volcano , are all strikingly different in their appearance azure : the @entity38 is usually blue , while the other two lakes , @entity40 and @entity41 and @entity58 , are separated by a shared crater wall and are typically green or red @entity7 is of interest to geologists because the three lakes are different colours yet are at the crest of the same volcano			2
the colour of the water changes thanks to chemical reactions from the minerals in the lake being triggered by volcanic gas activity , according to the local officer at @entity72			1
@entity73 , a student from @entity74 who visited the lakes in 2012 , said : ' it was a unique sight with the three lakes all different colours			0
' being so high you need some commitment to reach the place			0
i was amazed that the fog actually cleared up two hours after sunrise , as i went up there really early to catch the first rays			0

@entity6 is comprised of three different *bodies* of water - all of which are different colours
volcanic activity *affects* the minerals in the lake , causing chemical reactions that affect the *hue*
the lakes can turn black and white , offering an *incredible* *mystery* for geologists to *unravel*
