among @entity1 's first diving experiences was an encounter with @entity4 's jellyfish , the graceful giants of the sea that grow up to 6ft 6in in diameter			1
perhaps understandably the sighting inspired an obsession for @entity10 , 40 , to one day photograph the creatures , which are 100 times the size of an average jellyfish and are most commonly found in the waters between @entity16 and @entity17			1
and when the @entity20 photographer achieved her goal on a diving trip into the waters of @entity24 , @entity26 province , @entity17 , she said she felt ' pure joy '			1
' i was delighted and it was an incredible experience , but on that particular occasion i did n't have the underwater photography equipment to capture the images in the way i wanted			0
' from then on i became obsessed with them and getting the perfect shot , and years later i got my moment			0
' @entity1 was able to photograph the enormous five - foot jellyfish in all its glory			1
she spent three days diving with her husband , @entity58 , 40 , on the lookout for the incredible creature			2
@entity1 says : ' i had to dive deep into the open sea to be able to find one , but it was worth it in the end and i felt pure joy when i did			2
' it was a dream of mine achieved , the jellyfish are so beautiful and inoffensive , and because of that i was n't afraid at all			0
' a lot of patience was needed , as there were lot of jellyfish in the sea but most of them were hurt or almost dead , i wanted one that was healthy and a beauty to shoot			0
' the @entity4 's jellyfish is classified in the same category as the lion 's mane jellyfish , the largest cnidarian in the world			1
the diameter when fully grown is slightly greater than the height of an average man , with the ability to grow up to 6ft 6in			1
although their stings are generally very painful , they are not known for causing any major damage to humans			0
despite their formidable size , @entity1 loves photographing nature 's gentle giants			2
she says : ' it 's funny because most of the time my friends call me crazy , but they like and admire my photographs and so that really makes me happy			0
' it 's important that we respect and protect nature that is all around us , i believe this is our duty to life and the future of our planet			0

photographer @entity1 became obsessed with snapping @entity4 's jellyfish after seeing them when diving
the 40 - year - old took these amazing photographs while diving off @entity24 in @entity17 's @entity26 province
she photographed an *estimated* *4ft* *9in* creature , but the @entity4 's jellyfish can grow up to 6ft 6in in diameter
