by @entity0 they look like they 've dropped down from another galaxy			0
but these mesmerising figures are in fact a bunch of bees , beetles and ants			0
in a collection of extraordinary close - ups , the insects ' microscopic neon patterns that go unnoticed by humans are revealed			2
other - worldly : this is a tiger beetle - a species normally known for its fast pace and venemous attack different take : photographer @entity19 , of @entity20 in @entity21 , captured shots of numerous bugs including a jewel frog beetle , an ant , a bee and a mantis and they are n't shy , obediently holding their glare for ten minutes at a time for the camera			1
among the assortment of everyday bugs in @entity21 , a jewel frog beetle , dragonfly , bee and red ant were all photographed to show off their intricate patterns			1
their miniscule hairs can be seen in great detail - which normally would be missed as they fly past			0
@entity44 , also know as @entity45 in @entity46 , are commonly known as @entity47 due to the large back legs			0
toy - like : the mantis is a regal figure in the insect world - but this unusual image makes the willowy bug looks translucent , as if it is a toy made out of rubber character : this red ant looks like a character from a sci - fi film and the glaring sun highlights its features while bees normally zoom past , mr @entity19 was able to capture one looking still and plump , almost like a manatee mesmerising : but close - up the bee looks just as alien - like as the others - with leopard spots on its eyes its outer shell is metallic green with a gold line running down its back			1
photographer @entity19 from @entity20 , @entity21 , spent ten minutes on each picture of the tiny insects			1
the flying bee was around 50cm away from mr @entity19 , while the extreme close - ups were taken from just 10cm away			2
neon : the obedient insects , which stayed still for ten minutes at a time , are covered in neon patterns that are too small and nuanced for the human eye to detect faces : in this bizarre image of a bug eating another , their eyes and stances seem to betray emotion mr @entity19 had to be calm and patient when taking the photos , to prevent the tiny insects from flying away			1
he said : ' all of the photographs were taken in my studio in @entity21			0
' you can see a jewel frog beetle , dragonfly , red ant and flying bee			1
mr @entity19 spent weeks monitoring the insects and positioning himself to capture their glowing detail delicate : he had to get as near as 10cm away from his objects for ten minutes without scaring them away ' the flying bee was the only one moving , and luckily , the other insects managed to stay incredibly still			2
' the extreme close - ups were only 10 centimetres away , which allowed me to capture clear macro photographs			0
' all of the insects had to be incredibly still for the process to work			0
