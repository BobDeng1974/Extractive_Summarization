the government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence , and it ended up at the @entity64			0
the wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it , then sold it at auction to an agent working for @entity27			0
@entity27 also bought the @entity71 where @entity6 practiced law in @entity73 in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as @entity77			2
for decades , the theater chair was housed in that courthouse			0
around 1980 , the chair was placed inside the museum , where it 's now part of the ' with @entity83 and @entity85 ' exhibit			2
' @entity6 was one of @entity27 's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village , he wanted to collect @entity6 stuff as an educational tool , ' said curator @entity90			2
' the courthouse is pretty much the first thing @entity27 acquired related to @entity6 and the chair came soon after			2
' a playbill from @entity95 from the night president @entity6 was assassinated on april 14 , 1865 is shown on display at the @entity14 in @entity15 a copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by @entity100 provided by the @entity102 @entity101 shows @entity37 shooting @entity102 president @entity6 as he sits in the presidential box at @entity7 a copy of a 1865 lithographic print by @entity107 provided by the @entity102 @entity101 shows the same event from a different angle many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are @entity6 's blood			1

@entity123 , a historic presenter at the museum , tells passers - by that @entity6 's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft , 4in tall			2
taking in objects from the final hours of two important @entity102 lives is a major draw to the museum			0
the @entity27 also owns the limousine president @entity133 was riding in when he was fatally shot in @entity134 nearly a century later			2
museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum , along with the bus @entity141 rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement			1

' there 's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time , ' she said			0
' and hopefully , along with that , you 're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile			0
' museum visitor @entity171 stood before the chair , peered silently into the glass - enclosed case at the rocking chair , then snapped pictures for posterity ' you just get drawn into these things , ' said @entity171 , 47 , who came from suburban @entity179 with his family to the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity30			1
' it is a tragic part of our history and our country			0
i think it 's important to take it all in			0
' milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo			0
about 8,000 people visited the limo on november 22 , 2013 , a free - admission day marking the 50th anniversary of @entity133 's assassination , so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the @entity25 anniversary , which also has free admission			1
the single - shot @entity204 pistol @entity37 used to kill @entity6 is displayed at the @entity205 at @entity7 in @entity8 ' it really is about the power of the artifact , ' said @entity209 , president of the @entity27 , as the entire history attraction is known			1

@entity219 has also visited @entity220 in @entity134 where @entity133 was assassinated			0
' you just have to try to take it in when you 're in those areas , ' he said , but he wonders ' why we gravitate ' toward places and things associated with these types of events			0
@entity151 , whose book helped inspire @entity231 's movie , ' @entity6 , ' says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous			2
' in some ways , it 's more familiar when it 's a chair , a bus or a limo , ' she said			1
' there 's something about the tangibility of these things			0
' the chair in which @entity6 was show is regularly displayed in an encasing at the @entity14			1
for the 150th anniversary it will be taken out of the encasing			0
