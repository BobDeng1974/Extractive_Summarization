by @entity0 a new encrypted social network aims to entice web users put off @entity3 and @entity4 by revelations of @entity7 spying and fears of lack of privacy			2
@entity11 encrypts all user content - including status updates , messages and photos - allowing only those invited to a user 's group to see it			1
even @entity11 's admins claim they are unable read the content uploaded to the site unless they , too , are invited to			2
like @entity3 , but private : @entity11 's interface is similar to established social networks but it uses encryption to ensure that only those people users want to see their content are able to access it the new privacy - focused service comes in the wake of a string of revelations about the behind - the - scenes access the @entity7 has to online services like @entity39 and @entity3			1
documents leaked by former @entity7 contractor @entity41 have outlined how the @entity7 's @entity44 programme gives officials access to material including online messages , live chats and file transfers			0
the reporting of the top secret information proved to be a public relations disaster for a range of high - profile tech firms as it claimed the programme was run with the assistance of the companies involved			0
the companies have all emphatically denied colluding with the @entity7			0
@entity11 is the creation of three students from @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 - a world leader in privacy legislation - where the service is also hosted			1
co-founder @entity67 , a psychology student , told @entity68 that their aim was to ' make encryption accessible and easy to use for people who are n't geeks or are n't hackers '			1
the social network , which is appropriately named after a character in @entity76 's dystopian - and increasingly prescient - classic 1984 , uses a two - step , hybrid encryption system to scramble users ' communications			1
@entity7 whistleblower @entity41 : documents he leaked revealed how spies are able to access users ' online messages , live chats and file transfers users logging into the social network are presented with a list of groups , which look and work in way similar to @entity3 pages , the @entity87 blog reports			0
but in @entity96 , the groups are in fact encrypted conversations between their members that are unreadable to anyone who has not been invited - a process which provides users with the decryption key			0
although @entity11 is similar in appearance to both @entity4 and @entity3 , in effect it functions more like @entity106 , a leaner mobile app that functions like a social network but dispenses with profile pages to focus of messaging			0
rather than logging on to a website users access @entity112 through a browser extension , which encrypts the content before it leaves their computer making it incomprehensible to anyone trying to spy on it			1
however , @entity11 's creators - none of whom are computer science majors - say their social network is not a foolproof answer to state - sponsored digital spying			1
it would be possible for content destined for @entity112 to be uncovered if , for example , spies were able to hack a user 's computer			2
and while they claim to be unable to read the content posted to the site , @entity11 's admins admit that they do store metadata - information describing who the message is from and to , for example - which could be useful to those conduction surveillance			1
it also does not mask users ' ip addresses - the unique identifiers for all computers connected to the internet - so interactions with @entity112 are far from anonymous even if users sign up with an pseudonymous email address			2
@entity11 is currently available as an extension for @entity39 's @entity150 , and versions are planned for @entity152 and @entity153 as well as @entity154 and @entity156 apps			0
currently still in beta testing phase , @entity11 is free and you can sign up by visiting @entity159 .			0

@entity63 - based @entity112 aims to make encryption accessible to ' *non-geeks* '
it encrypts users ' data the moment it is entered into their computers
the network 's administrators claim even they can not access user content
but its creators warn that it is not foolproof and they do store metadata
