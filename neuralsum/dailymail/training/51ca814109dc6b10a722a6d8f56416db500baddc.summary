by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:50 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 15:41 est , 17 july 2013 the @entity7 , @entity8 , mansion once owned by @entity5 designer @entity4 - and the place he was fatally shot - is headed for the auction block			1
the extravagant ten - bedroom home , known as @entity11 , was originally built in 1930 and features a 54 - foot long mosaic pool lined with 24 - karat gold , numerous frescos , ornate statues , arched doorways and an open air courtyard			1
@entity18 is handling the sale , which is scheduled for september 17			1
in 1997 , the 50 - year - old @entity4 was killed in front of the property by a man who later committed suicide			2
tourists can still routinely be spotted taking photos in front of the house			0
the property had been operating as a ten - room boutique hotel but had closed			1
the house - whose most recent owner was telecoms magnate @entity36 - had its asking price cut by $ 50million after failing to find a buyer for more than a year			1
he initially asked $ 125million for the property , making it the most expensive house on the market when it was first put up for sale a year ago			1
bargain ! the mansion had previously been listed for $ 125million , before the price was slashed in november to $ 100million , and again in may to $ 75million			1
its last asking price before auction was $ 50million expansion : the home was totally remodelled by @entity4 himself after he fell in love with the property unique : there are not many homes as utterly lavish as the house where @entity4 lived until his death pool : but only an extravagant multi-millionaire could afford to buy the @entity85 mansion dark past : it was outside this house where legendary designer @entity4 was killed by a lone gunman but in november he was forced to take $ 25million off the asking price , and he then lowered it by another $ 25million six months later			1
mr @entity36 bought the luxury mansion in 2000 , three years after @entity4 's murder , and converted the residence into a boutique hotel and private club in 2009			2
those who have toured the incredible property maintain that the once gold - lined swimming pool and museum quality frescoes are just a few of the lavish features that contribute to the hefty price tag			2
in fact , such is its value , property experts refer to the luxurious villa as a ' trophy property '			0
boutique : the @entity4 motif remains on the floor of one of the hotel suites , a tribute to the designer who spent $ 33million renovating and expanding the property after he bought it in 1992 prints and patterns : the villa was originally built in the 1930s by architect @entity122 as an homage to the oldest existing house in the western hemisphere in @entity126 lavish : the hotel still features the murals and frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings by mr @entity4 , a detail that contributes to the hefty price tag @entity134 : villa by @entity30 looks out onto the @entity136 from its @entity85 location , an exclusive section of the @entity7 strip a step in the wrong direction : mr @entity4 was tragically killed at the entrance to @entity11 in 1997 by @entity143 who committed suicide shortly after the now legendary @entity5 designer bought @entity11 in 1992 for just under $ 10million after supposedly passing by and falling in love with it			1
originally built in the 1930s by architect @entity122 , the @entity85 property was somewhat dilapidated until @entity4 invested $ 33million into restoring and improving it			2
once an architect himself , the flamboyant designer added a 6,100 - square - foot south wing and a 54 - foot pool lined with 24 karat gold			0
illuminating : a skylight brightens up the original interior designed by @entity4 in the famously ornate home that he bought in 1992 after falling in love with the property grandeur : the couturier added a 6,100 - square - foot south wing to the property and covered the courtyard in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles guest suite ? the property cost mr @entity4 $ 10million and though he plugged $ 33million of his own money into its renovation , after his death his family made a quick sale for only $ 20million to its most recent owner residential palace : the one - acre property features ten bedrooms , 11 bathrooms , seven fireplaces , a garage for 12 cars and a guesthouse the impressive courtyard he covered in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles while elaborate frescoes were painted across the property 's walls and ceilings			1
icon : missed by the fashion world , the late @entity4 was once an architect indeed it was @entity4 's pride and joy until the fateful june day of 1997 when @entity143 assassinated him in cold blood on the very steps of the house			0
when @entity198 scrambled to sell off the designer 's assets , mr @entity36 gained from a quick bargain and bought the villa for a cool $ 20million			0
after residing there himself for a number of years , he turned the opulent property into a boutique hotel			0
the property is now known as @entity29 by @entity30 after the events impresario @entity210 who renovated and re-styled it			0
nowadays , according to the hotel 's website , the decor ' takes up style where fashion designer @entity4 left off			0
' boasting 23,400 square feet , the ornate house includes seven fireplaces , a guest house and a parking garage large enough for a dozen cars , and all within a one acre plot			0
for the past three years hotel guests have enjoyed the surrounding attractions of @entity85 's historic @entity225 district while re-energizing from the day poolside or in one of two of the residence 's lounges			2
