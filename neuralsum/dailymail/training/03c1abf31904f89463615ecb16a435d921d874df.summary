by @entity0 last updated at 8:54 am on 16th december 2011 the @entity2 military officially declared the @entity3 over yesterday after more than eight years of bloodshed			1
a ceremony was held at @entity7 ’s heavily - fortified airport to mark the withdrawal of @entity2 troops , an estimated 4,500 of whom have died in the conflict			1
some 100,000 @entity12 are also thought to have lost their lives			1
@entity2 defence secretary @entity14 told his troops they could leave with great pride			1
‘ after a lot of blood spilled by @entity12 and @entity2 , the mission of an @entity12 that could govern and secure itself has become real , ’ he said			1
@entity2 soldiers at the former @entity2 @entity21 near @entity7 prepare for the start of a ceremony marking the end of the @entity2 military engagement @entity2 defense secretary @entity14 speaks during the flag - lowering ceremony he acknowledged the country faced serious challenges from terrorism , sectarian violence , and political and economic difficulties but insisted @entity2 would stand by the @entity12 as they sought peace and prosperity			1
at the sombre occasion , where the @entity2 flag was taken down , he told his audience of a few hundred troops : ‘ no words , no ceremony can provide full tribute to the sacrifices which have brought this day to pass			2
’ the conflict began in march 2003 when @entity45 and @entity46 launched an invasion across the @entity49 border , ousting @entity50 but failing to find his supposed weapons of mass destruction			0
in @entity53 , a former @entity54 stronghold , several thousand @entity12 celebrated the withdrawal , burning the @entity56 and waving pictures of dead relatives			2
elsewhere in the country the reaction was more mixed			0
soldiers stand to attention as they are addressed by mr @entity14			0
he told them they had made @entity12 ' sovereign and independent and able to govern and secure itself ' @entity2 soldiers carry an @entity12 national flag , right , and a @entity2 flag as the ceremony to case the @entity71 flag gets underway ' we 've spilled a lot of blood here ' : @entity2 secretary of defense @entity14 walks across tarmac with army general @entity77 of the @entity78 in @entity12 , on his arrival in @entity7 this morning			1
right , @entity2 soldiers hold the flag of @entity71 before the ceremony marking the official end the military operations many @entity2 will be delighted to have their troops home			2
with its huge expense of more than £ 515billion , dubious causes and post-war blunders , the @entity12 conflict has been the most unpopular @entity2 military venture since the @entity90			1
has the @entity2 mission in @entity12 been a success ? the last 4,000 @entity2 troops will withdraw by the end of the year despite fears that @entity12 ’s military will not be able to cope alone with the continuing insurgency			1
one of the biggest mistakes following the ousting of @entity50 was to dismantle his army , and senior @entity2 officers doubt @entity12 ’s ability to defend its own soil or even its valuable oil rigs in the @entity106			1
@entity107 wanted 3,000 troops to stay on as part of a deal to train the @entity12 armed forces but talks fell apart over demands for @entity2 soldiers to have immunity from prosecution over any abuses			1
on wednesday , president @entity118 marked the end of the war by praising the ‘ extraordinary achievement ’ of @entity2 troops			1
by @entity123 most @entity12 were happy to see the back of @entity50 but say their lives today are just as bad for different reasons			2
under the brutal dictator it was possible to walk the streets of @entity7 and other @entity12 cities in safety – as long as you did not actively oppose his rule			2
but now there is little security			0
violence is rampant , even if it has declined since the terrible sectarian bloodletting in the middle of the last decade			0
much as most @entity12 detested the @entity2 invasion and occupation , many fear the security situation will deteriorate further after the withdrawal of @entity2 troops			1
and despite @entity12 ’s immense oil wealth , its people struggle with daily power cuts			0
there are also water shortages			0
unemployment is high and many complain of massive corruption			0
the faction - ridden @entity12 government is widely seen as unstable and incompetent			0
@entity2 soldiers gather at @entity21 before the start of the flag lowering ceremony			0
the last @entity2 troops are withdrawing nearly nine years after the invasion that ousted @entity50 say cheese : @entity2 military personnel pose for a picture before the start of the casing the flag ceremony a member of @entity2 security personnel pulls her luggage across the parade ground at @entity21 while waiting to depart from @entity12 president @entity118 greets soldiers in @entity173 , @entity174 yesterday			1
the president and first lady @entity175 thanked the troops for their service in @entity12 president @entity118 and his wife , @entity179 , embrace while addressing troops at @entity173			2
the withdrawal marks the fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring home all @entity2 forces from @entity12 one @entity12 told the @entity186 that ‘ at least before 2003 , there was one bad guy , @entity50 ’ but now there are many			2
@entity54 has a foothold in @entity12 which it never did while @entity50 ruled – he reviled @entity192 ’s network , which in turn despised his ‘ godless ’ regime			0
and militant @entity196 groups , brutally suppressed by @entity50 ’s henchmen , are now flexing their muscles			0
@entity12 ’s @entity199 in the north of the country , however , benefited significantly from the @entity2 - led invasion			2
persecuted terribly under @entity50 , they now mostly run their own affairs and their oil - rich economy is thriving			0
but many @entity12 fear their country is fragmenting along sectarian lines , with @entity196 , @entity207 and @entity199 all vying for a share of the spoils			0
and @entity12 ’s rival neighbours , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 , are all lining up to back their different interests in @entity12 , a key state at the heart of the volatile @entity216 .			0
