@entity0 tried to seduce a married @entity1 and when that failed , wed his cousin			1
she lived on a diet of morphine and grouse , and the occasional cocktail			0
pictured above in 1934 she was rich , ugly , dissolute and ‘ the destroyer of many a happy home ’ as one ex-lover bitterly put it			2
she did her best to seduce a married @entity1 and when that failed , wed his cousin			2
she lived on a diet of morphine and grouse , with the occasional cocktail thrown in			0
the colour @entity15 was created for her — and how she loved to shock ! if it was n’t morphine then it was opium or cocaine , and she loved nothing better than discussing her private collection of leather - bound volumes of pornography			2
when it came to sex she was a voracious man - eater , who ’d steal her daughters ’ boyfriends and seduce her best friends ’ husbands			1
yet @entity0 was also the living embodiment of @entity33 chic , a style icon who inspired designers @entity37 and @entity39 and who wore so many jewels they weighed her tiny body down			1
heiress to the @entity46 sewing machine empire , she was ‘ the very picture of fashionable depravity ’ , according to her rival @entity47			2
and @entity47 should know — @entity0 bedded her husband and determinedly remained his mistress for 17 years			1
the uber - rich mrs @entity0 was also the greatest collector of fine jewellery the 20th century ever saw			1
her rapacious and salacious life was remembered this week when one of her pieces — a crystal and pearl clip — was among the highlights of @entity60 ’s spring gem sales			0
though she became a central part of @entity63 society during the inter-war years , buying up the friendship of royalty , ministers , peers and moguls , @entity0 was in fact half - @entity71 , half - @entity70			1
her mother was @entity46 , daughter of the inventor of the first commercially successful sewing machine , while her father was a @entity71 aristocrat , the @entity77			0
at 19 , she was married off to prince @entity78 , but the relationship fell apart when she found him in bed with the chauffeur			0
marriage , however , had unlocked an inextinguishable sexuality and soon she was to be found in the @entity84 in @entity85 desperately trying to bed @entity1 , then a young mp			0
though she became a central part of @entity63 society during the inter-war years , buying up the friendship of royalty , ministers , peers and moguls , @entity0 was in fact half - @entity71 , half - @entity70 according to @entity1 ’s later private secretary , @entity96 : ‘ she was a wicked but attractive woman who , according to mrs @entity1 , tried to seduce her husband shortly after their marriage			1
it was unsuccessful and she was forgiven , even by @entity100			0
’ by now , @entity0 had three children			1
‘ the oldest , @entity104 , is like my first husband only a great deal more masculine			0
the second , @entity46 , is like me , only without guts ; the third was the result of a horrible man called @entity111 , ’ she spat when someone gently inquired about them			1
nonetheless she had a sneaking fondness for children — but only at a distance			0
one day strolling in a park , she exclaimed : ‘ oh look at those pretty little girls			0
are n’t they beautifully dressed ! we must go and ask the nurse whose they are			0
’ walking over , @entity0 duly asked : ‘ whose lovely little children are these ? ’ ‘ yours , madam ! ’ snapped the nurse			1
‘ she was fascinating and i suppose wicked ; her wickedness was on a scale that it had its own distinction , ’ declared @entity124 , son of the @entity125			2
again , he should know — @entity0 threw herself at his bumbling father in the hope of becoming an @entity132 countess			1
@entity0 's second husband was the @entity134 ( both pictured ) - a banker , and son of the second @entity138 , connected to @entity1 through the @entity139 , and a decidedly good egg after a brief dalliance in @entity85 , @entity125 realised what a lightning storm he ’d walked into and tried to back away			1
her brother , now having succeeded their father as the @entity146 , claimed her reputation had been damaged by this rejection and challenged the bewildered @entity125 to a duel			0
the peer scuttled back across the @entity151 and @entity0 returned to flicking through the pages of @entity154 ’s peerage for a new husband			1
he was soon to arrive			0
but first @entity0 decided that a little remodelling was in order			1
it was not sufficient that she was rich , she must have breeding and looks to match			0
after commissioning a portrait of herself she ’d been appalled by the result and set to work			2
she had a nose - job , without anaesthetic , threw away her entire wardrobe and started to consult couturiers			2
and she began , very seriously , reading books			0
the @entity0 that the @entity134 met and married was a very different article to the teenager who ’d wed the @entity170			1
her new husband was rich , a banker , the son of the second @entity138 , connected to @entity1 through the @entity139 , and a decidedly good egg			0
the couple made their home in @entity71 , with frequent visits to @entity178			0
in the milieu she now inhabited , sexual freedom was obligatory once she ’d secured the marriage by having a child with @entity0			1
a friend recalled @entity0 in @entity184 with her lover @entity185 , later @entity186 : ‘ she and @entity185 tracked @entity188 down to a brothel and through a rough glass window watched him perform with a poll [ prostitute ]			1
he did n’t know of course , but they told him afterwards			0
’ @entity196 , wayward , uncontrollable , her marriage remained a success despite her determination to cuckold as many wives as possible			2
she described herself as always being ‘ on the scent ’ of new conquest			2
‘ it ’s a thrilling feeling , ’ she confessed , ‘ like tasting absinthe for the first time			2
soon the man asks : “ when may i come to tea ? ” — that ’s when i sharpen the knife			2
’ the painter sir @entity210 was both fearful and admiring : ‘ she ’s as dangerous as an albatross , ’ he declared			2
another lover , @entity212 , father of writer @entity213 , described how smoking opium before sex lowered her inhibitions to the point of extinction			0
as old age set in , @entity0 's thoughts returned to her childhood			1
her mother had committed suicide when @entity0 was only four			1
now her thoughts moved along similar lines and on more than one occasion she attempted to take her own life			0
pictured in 1962 while in @entity85 she mixed with the new , thrilling art movement which included the writer @entity230 and @entity231 , founder of the @entity232			0
when @entity231 ’s star ballerina complained of a headache , @entity0 produced ‘ a white powder which worked wonders ’			1
it was cocaine , her new drug of choice			0
the composer and painter @entity240 was similarly introduced to the dubious delights of cocaine by @entity0 and was soon serving it during decorous tea - parties at @entity246 , his @entity247 stately home			1
but by the time @entity212 was @entity249 ’s ambassador in @entity85 , at the end of @entity251 , @entity0 had moved on again			1
@entity47 learned from her friendly rival — she tolerated , even encouraged , her husband ’s on - off affair with mrs @entity0 — how to jazz up a boring drinks party			1
‘ just pour @entity256 [ an amphetamine ] into the cocktails , darling ! ’ @entity0 kept two yachts on the go , crewed and ready for action , in the @entity263			1
her hospitality was lavish , but it came at a price			0
society photographer @entity266 jumped ship after a brutal few days cooped up with his hostess under azure - blue skies : ‘ @entity0 has been impossible			1
she bullies one person , keeping the others on her side until it ’s time to bully the next person			0
she is spoilt , capricious , and wicked			0
’ other guests on her bigger yacht , the @entity278 @entity277 , included the @entity279 and a then unknown @entity70 , @entity280			2
the romance between the soon - to - be @entity282 and his divorcee was still fresh , ‘ otherwise , make no mistake , @entity0 would have gone for him ’ , observed a fellow passenger			1
it was 1935 and the world would have to wait another year to discover who the @entity279 loved enough to give up his throne for — but in the calm waters of the @entity263 @entity0 was already privy to the country ’s most devastating secret			1
all these things , good and bad , should have made @entity0 the focus of @entity297 ’s attention , but it was her clothes — and her jewels — that people talked about most			1
there were diamonds , emeralds , sapphires , rubies , outside the @entity307 , there was nothing to match them			0
the big jewellers of the day , @entity311 , @entity312 , were in seventh heaven for she never stopped shopping			0
@entity316 saluted her ‘ for daring to be different ’			2
at the @entity84 , diners climbed on chairs to get a glimpse of her @entity39 monkey - fur coat embroidered in gold , and she shocked the public by wearing a @entity324 hat shaped like a high - heeled shoe			2
it was then that @entity39 invented ‘ shocking pink ’ for @entity0 , and she wore it with panache — a lobster dress , or a black suit with pink lips for pockets			1
alas , all legends fade and @entity251 helped reshape society			0
@entity0 was getting older , while husband @entity188 was in a wheelchair			1
she was deeply shamed to discover that her daughter , @entity337 , who stayed in @entity71 and heroically worked for the @entity338 , had unknowingly married a @entity340 spy who betrayed her @entity342 colleagues			0
@entity337 , who retained her family title of @entity344 , had her head shaved publicly as a punishment			0
a once - proud family , one of the richest in @entity348 , was humbled			2
as old age set in , @entity0 ’s thoughts returned to her childhood			1
her mother had committed suicide when @entity0 was only four			1
now her thoughts moved along similar lines and on more than one occasion she attempted to take her own life			0
the long - suffering , fun - loving @entity188 , who she stuck with till the bitter end , died around the time of her 63rd birthday			2
@entity0 returned to @entity85 , to a vast town - house in the @entity362 , and slowly the shades were drawn around her			1
she died aged 72 , but already the world had moved on			0
in the age of @entity367 , nobody cared to hear about a woman who wore a shoe for a hat , had a shade of pink named for her , collected the biggest set of priceless jewels ever known and encouraged people to take cocaine with their cup of tea			0
the new world seemed more interesting than that .			0

@entity0 was the living embodiment of @entity33 chic
she was a voracious man - eater , who ’d steal her daughters ’ boyfriends and seduce her best friends ’ husbands
