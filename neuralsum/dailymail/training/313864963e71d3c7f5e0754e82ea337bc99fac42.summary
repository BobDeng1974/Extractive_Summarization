by @entity0 last updated at 12:46 pm on 30th december 2011 an adopted woman spent her whole life thinking she was an only child unaware she had nine siblings living minutes from her home			1
@entity6 had always longed for a brother or sister to play with after being adopted when she was six months old			1
now , at the age of 64 , @entity6 has discovered she is the oldest of ten children who live a few miles away from her house in @entity13 , @entity14			1
reunited at last : @entity6 ( centre ) with six of her nine newly discovered siblings ( clockwise from left ) @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 at her home in @entity13 remarkably , she never encountered her siblings - @entity18 , @entity20 , @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity17 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 - despite sharing a postcode			1
now reunited with her long - lost family , @entity6 has been amazed that their paths never crossed before			1
she said : ' i found out i was adopted when i was 13 and it was so unexpected , i had no idea i had brothers and sisters			1
' i remember watching a programme about two sisters being reunited and i said it would be lovely if someone knocked on my door			2
' it was a bit lonely being an only child and i would have liked someone to play with			2
then one day i got the letter from the adoption society			0
' it ’s been a lovely shock meeting them all and it was lovely to know we all had the same mother and father			1
' catalyst : @entity6 with a photograph of her mother @entity57 and brother @entity22			2
her sisters started looking for @entity6 after her mother died in 2009 @entity6 , from @entity13 , has six children with her husband , 65 - year - old navy veteran @entity62 , and 12 grandchildren			1
but despite having a big family of her own , the retired supermarket worker always wondered if she had any siblings			0
little did she know that three of her sisters , @entity67 , @entity17 and @entity19 , had started looking for @entity6 after their mother , @entity57 , died in april 2009 , aged 82			1
their father @entity69 had died from a heart attack 23 years ago , aged 64			2
after more than a year of searching , matching birth certificates and endless phone calls , the brothers and sisters have now met for the first time			1
unearthing the past : @entity6 's sister @entity67 tried asking her mother ( above ) more questions about what happened to her oldest sibling , but the opportunity never arose she said : ' when i got the letter from an adoption society in @entity86 , they told me i was the oldest of ten			1
it ’s wonderful and i could n’t ask for a better family			0
' @entity67 , 62 , was told she had another sister , her parents ’ first - born child , before they were married , about 20 years ago			1
she said : ' for years and years , i tried to get my mum by herself to ask more questions			0
but the opportunity never arose			0
' there always seemed to be someone there and i was n’t able to find out more about it			0
' i told a couple of the others and when mum died , we decided to look for her			0
' @entity67 said she could not be happier to have found @entity6			2
she said : ' we were more concerned for her because there are so many of us and it ’s a lot to digest			0
' @entity19 , 56 , said @entity6 is very much like their mother			2
she said : ' she is more like our mother than any of us , she is our mother ’s double in so many ways - the way she talks , everything			0
' we get on really well and we hit it off the moment we met			0
she made us feel so welcome and so at ease			0
' it took us just over a year to find her and we nearly fainted when we realised she was only down the road			0
' it ’s crazy how none of our paths have ever crossed			0
@entity6 thought she was an only child , so you can imagine the shock she got			1
' @entity19 said she is looking forward to spending many more happy times together as a family			0
she said : ' it ’s just a shame it did n’t happen years ago			2

@entity6 was 13 years old when told she was adopted **...**
**...** but only knew about brothers and sisters 50 years later
it turns out they have been living in same postcode all this time
' it was lonely being an only child . it ’s been a lovely shock meeting them '
