@entity0 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			1
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity6 , a @entity8 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			1
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction			0
an analyst believes @entity0 is in the best position to create the first ever conscious machine and already has related projects in the place			2
it recently bought a number of robotics firm , such as @entity27 pictured , for example			2
the analyst claims conscious machines could be developed within the next 20 years the acquisition of @entity32 is n’t @entity0 ’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning			1
its most recent @entity37 search update was created to make @entity0 ' more human ' - searches can now understand context , like a human brain , for example			1
its @entity43 app uses ‘ predictive analysis ’ to predict what @entity45 users will do next , before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked			0
@entity0 also hired futurist @entity51 as engineering director in 2012			2
@entity51 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			0
he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			0
' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity32 ’s @entity63 said in a recent interview			2
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity73 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			0
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity77 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			1
' @entity0 has agreed to establish an ethics board to ensure the artificial intelligence technology is n't abused , according to two people familiar with the deal , ' said @entity77 , which revealed the news			1
the @entity0 ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology			1
the purchase of @entity6 saw a comprehensive school - educated computer genius has become a multi-millionaire overnight after selling his company to @entity0			1
neuroscientist @entity95 , 37 , co-founded @entity32 just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
his company has yet to produce anything commercially but @entity0 has still paid £ 242million for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence			1
it represents @entity0 ’s biggest ever single acquisition in @entity104			1
the acquisition by the @entity107 - based giant is the biggest single purchase in @entity104			1
@entity32 specialises in ' machine learning ' designing computers that can learn from their mistakes mr @entity95 told @entity112 : ' we ’re really excited to be joining @entity0			1
' this partnership will allow us to turbo - charge our mission to harness the power of machine learning tools to tackle some of society ’s toughest problems , and help make our everyday lives more productive and enjoyable			0
' the website states @entity32 uses ‘ the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general - purpose learning algorithms			2
’ a friend of mr @entity95 said : ‘ he has very forward - looking ideas and can spot where industries are heading in the future			0
’ programmes that predict the way people think and can even teach computers to think for themselves are set to be the next big breakthrough in technology			0
it is believed @entity141 had been interested in buying @entity142 - based @entity32 , which employs 75 people , but @entity0 has now stolen a march on its rival			1
@entity95 , 27 neuroscientist @entity95 , 37 , co-founded @entity32 just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
he set up @entity32 with two other entrepreneurs , @entity63 and @entity150			2
his company has yet to produce anything commercially but @entity0 has still paid £ 242million for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence			1
mr @entity95 grew up in @entity156 , north @entity142			0
at the age of four , he saw his father , a @entity160 - @entity159 entrepreneur , playing chess and asked to be taught the rules			0
within weeks , he was beating his father			0
a couple of years later he was programming computers			0
he took his a-levels early at just 15 and says his local comprehensive kept him on a ‘ light rein ’ which enabled him to develop his other interests			0
he went on to @entity168 where he graduated with a double first in computer science			0
he set up @entity32 with two other entrepreneurs , @entity63 and @entity150			2
the business also counted @entity173 , the venture firm started by @entity141 backer @entity174 , as an investor			2
they will share in the £ 242million windfall			1
this latest acquisition follows @entity0 's recent purchase of seven robotics firms , including @entity27 , which makes humanoid robots , and @entity182 , which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries , for example			1
however , instead of being used in the robotics division , it is more likely @entity32 , and its expertise , will be used to improve @entity0 's current technologies - including voice and text search			1
@entity0 's most recent @entity37 search update , for example , was created to make @entity0 ' more human ' and searches can now understand context , like a human brain			1
@entity32 's technology could help develop this further			2
@entity32 designs machine learning algorithms for retailers and gamers this is n’t @entity0 ’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning			1
in addition to its @entity37 search update , the @entity43 app uses ' predictive analysis ' to predict what @entity45 users will do next , before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked			0
@entity0 also hired futurist @entity51 as engineering director in 2012			0
@entity51 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			0
he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			0
@entity227 added : ' a string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence , along with the recent hiring of @entity51 as a director of engineering shows that @entity0 is by no means done with machine learning : it is clear that the company is just getting started			2

ethics board set up as part of deal to acquire @entity8 @entity73 firm @entity32
the £ 242million acquisition is @entity0 's biggest - ever in @entity104
@entity141 was also said to have been in *negotiations* to buy the firm
this acquisition follows @entity0 's purchase of seven robotics companies
