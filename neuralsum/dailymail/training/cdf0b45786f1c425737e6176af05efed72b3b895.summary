a three - year - old autistic girl has made a splash in the art world with her extraordinary paintings			0
@entity4 began doing art as therapy , but when her parents decided to put the works on sale they began fetching prices of up to £ 830			1
and painting has also helped improve the youngster 's condition - she is now eager to play with her parents and has adopted a much happier demeanour			2
artwork : this is one of the paintings by @entity4 , an autistic three - year - old and budding artist therapy : @entity4 was encouraged by her parents to start painting as a form of medical treatment her mother @entity23 , of @entity24 in @entity25 , said she had received positive feedback since posting her daughter 's paintings on @entity29			1
' we realised about three months ago she is actually really talented , ' she said			0
' inquiries to buy her paintings were flooding in from all over the world and a framed print sold in a charity auction in @entity36 for £ 830			0
' @entity4 's financier father , @entity38 - @entity37 , added : ' when she started doing art therapy we thought it was amazing , but we 're her parents so we think everything she does is amazing			1
' but lots of other people started saying it was great			2
it went berserk from there			0
' so far , the family has sold eight of @entity4 's artworks , and is planning to makes prints of the paintings available too			1
striking : @entity4 's works became instantly popular when her mother posted them on @entity29 lucrative : eight of her paintings have now been sold , with one fetching as much as £ 830 the three - year - old , who does not speak , was diagnosed with autism last year after her parents noticed she rarely made eye contact with them , and they tried a number of different therapies to help socialise her			1
' we started with play therapy and we 've had speech , equine , occupational and music therapy , looked at her nutrition and quite a few other methods , ' said ms @entity70 , 32			1
' with the expert help of many therapists she changed dramatically in a short space of time			0
' she used to be consumed by books , eye contact was a rare occurrence , she did n't want to , or know how to , play with us and got desperately distressed when we took her near any other children			0
' she now rides on my back in fits of laughter , plays and communicates by creating her own signs			0
impressionistic : @entity4 refuses to use an easel , and prefers laying the paper flat on a table while painting ' we still have a long way to go with her social skills and speech , but we are having many more good days			1
' her autism has created a style which i 've never seen in a child of her age - she has an understanding of colours and how they interact			2
she beams with excitement and joy when i get out the paints			0
' @entity4 's talent came to light a few months ago when her mother first encouraged her to start drawing			1
' as part of play therapy i tried to get @entity4 to draw , ' she said			1
' i then got out an easel - which she hated - but when i put the paper and paints on the table she loved it			0
' she was soon high - flicking and stabbing with the brushes			0
' progress : although the three - year - old does not speak , she has become much more socially aware recently mrs @entity70 added : ' i would love to think that @entity4 's story can be an inspiration to any parents with an autistic child			1
' @entity124 , co-director of @entity125 , the @entity127 's inclusive arts centre , said : ' as @entity4 's paintings demonstrate so well , disability is no barrier to creativity			2
' the family are hoping to arrange an exhibition in @entity36 to give @entity4 's paintings a wider audience			2
all profits from sales go towards art materials and paying her therapists .			0
