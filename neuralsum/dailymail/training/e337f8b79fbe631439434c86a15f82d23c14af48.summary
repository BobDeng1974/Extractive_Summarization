the @entity1 ’s nitrogen - rich atmosphere made life possible , but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery			1
now , scientists believe they have found the answer : that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes , also made the atmosphere habitable			0
geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in @entity1 ’s atmosphere three billion years ago			1
tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and streams of lava from volcanoes ( pictured ) also made the atmosphere , a new study says			0
geoscientists studied the chemistry of what goes on beneath volcanic rocks to work out how so much nitrogen was created writing in the journal @entity29 , @entity30 researchers explained that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis , as well as tectonic activity			1
while scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen , which makes up one fifth of the @entity1 ’s atmosphere , the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery			1
the study explains that when a mass of land is subducted – or dragged down below the continental crust – it releases volatile elements into the rock above			0
a subducted tectonic boundary is pictured to investigate the problem , dr @entity53 and professor @entity54 studied how nitrogen travels through rocks in the @entity1 ’s crust , before being vented by volcanoes , @entity52 reported			1
volcanoes spew large quantities of nitrogen into the air , as well as sulphur , steam and carbon dioxide			0
they say this happens because when a mass of land is subducted – or dragged down below the continental crust – it releases volatile elements into the rock above			0
these elements include nitrogen , which is either locked inside rock or released as a gas in an eruption			0
dr @entity53 and professor @entity54 say that nitrogen in the @entity1 ’s crust tends to form ammonium ions which are often incorporated into silicate minerals - rock - forming minerals that make up 90 percent of the @entity1 ’s crust			1
the process is thought to have affected most of the nitrogen on @entity1 and almost all the nitrogen on @entity87 and @entity88			0
on @entity1 , the silicate minerals react in the presence of oxygen or oxygen - containing compounds			2
when this happens , the ammonium molecules break down into water and nitrogen , which works its way to the @entity1 ’s surface through volcanic vents			2
the researchers believe that this would explain why @entity1 ’s atmosphere differs so much to @entity88 and @entity87 ’			0
the alien planets have no plate tectonics and little nitrogen , which led to the evolution of plant and animal life on @entity1			2
the study also adds weight to the theory that plate tectonics were already active on @entity1 before nitrogen started to build up in our atmosphere			1
when land is subducted - dragged down beneath the @entity1 's continental crust - it releases volatile elements into the rock above , including nitrogen			1
it tends to form ammonium ions which are often incorporated into silicate minerals - rock - forming minerals that make up 90 percent of the @entity1 ’s crust			1
silicate minerals react in the presence of oxygen or oxygen - containing compounds			2
when this happens , the ammonium molecules break down into water and nitrogen			0
the nitrogen works its way to the @entity1 ’s surface through volcanic vents and is spewed out of volcanoes			0

geoscientists at the @entity30 , studied what goes on beneath volcanic rocks to work out how so much nitrogen was created
they say a chemical reaction in the @entity1 's crust is responsible for turning silicate minerals that make up much of the crust , into water and nitrogen
*experts* believe nitrogen started building up in the @entity1 's atmosphere three billion years ago and created the *conditions* for life on @entity1
