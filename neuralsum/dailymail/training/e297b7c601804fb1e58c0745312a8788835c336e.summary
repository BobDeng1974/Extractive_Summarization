president @entity3 's 2016 budget proposal is as silly as a comedy sketch , a @entity1 leadership aide told @entity5 on monday			1
' this $ 4 trillion budget is the silliest thing since @entity9 , ' the senior staffer said , recalling the @entity11 funnymen 's ' @entity13 ' routine			1
' the only think about it that is n't funny is that the president thinks it 's serious			0
' there was no shortage of budgetary body - slams on @entity21 as the @entity22 panned the @entity24 's dramatic budget , which another @entity1 aide officially declared ' doa – that 's @entity26			1
' programs like that typically benefit @entity47 ' powerful labor union constituency			0
both aides spoke on condition of anonymity so they could reflect what the first one called ' the true mood up here on the @entity55			0
' ' it 's bizarre and ridiculous , rolled up in a package of idiotic , ' he said			2
@entity22 lawmakers who spoke on the record were more circumspect but equally dismissive			1
' this proposal is n't really a budget at all – it is a messaging piece , ' said @entity64 rep. @entity63			2
' this so - called budget ignores both the reality of our already crippling $ 18 trillion national debt and of a new @entity22 majority in @entity36 that will not allow this laughable tax - and - spend proposal to pass			1
' ' @entity13 ' – @entity73 's @entity72 @entity63 claimed that the president 's proposal adds a whopping '' $ 2.1 trillion in new tax increases , on top of $ 1.7 trillion in tax hikes already imposed by the administration			2
' those tax hikes , totaled over ten years , would n't balance @entity3 's budget in 2016 , however , as it still leaves a $ 474 billion deficit			1
' president @entity3 likes to talk about his veto pen , ' @entity83 sen. @entity82 told @entity86 , ' and with the release of this budget , we can only conclude that he writes with red ink			2
' the budget 's tax rate on capital gains – investment income – would be the highest in 19 years			0
@entity3 is demanding a 7 per cent increase in domestic spending and the defense budget , undoing the fiscal restraint that marked the 2011 budget deal			2
@entity3 called those cuts ' mindless austerity			0
' rep. @entity63 , shown jan. 27 during a @entity104 hearing , said @entity3 's budget is a ' laughable tax - and - spend proposal ' sen. @entity107 ( left ) said @entity3 's legendary veto pen ' writes with red ink , ' while rep. @entity110 ( right ) joked about @entity111 and recurring unbalanced budgets @entity114 rep. @entity110 said in a statement that ' it 's fitting that president @entity3 released his budget on @entity111 because it 's a painful repeat of the same failed policies that he has presented to @entity120 for the past six years			1
' that 's a reference to the @entity123 movie , in which he is forced to relive the same day over and over again			0
senator @entity124 , the majority leader of the upper house of @entity120 , summed up the @entity22 's complaints			0
' what we saw this morning was another top - down , backward - looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the @entity132 and never balances – ever			0
' republicans now control both houses of @entity135 for the first time in @entity3 's presidency			0
asked to say something nice about the hefty budget book that arrived to great fanfare on @entity21 this morning , one @entity139 staffer said : ' it 's still winter , so my fireplace will like it			1

@entity22 lawmakers and their aides *lashed* out on monday after @entity3 sent his 2016 budget *request* to @entity21
' this $ 4 trillion budget is the silliest thing since @entity9 , ' said another , recalling the @entity11 comedy troupe 's ' @entity157 ' sketch
' @entity159 , ' ' ridiculous ' and ' idiotic ' were other *adjectives* used
one @entity64 @entity22 *congresswoman* called the budget ' laughable '
budget is ' dead on arrival , ' declared a @entity1 aide ; a @entity24 staffer said of the heavy *printed* budget that ' my fireplace will like it '
