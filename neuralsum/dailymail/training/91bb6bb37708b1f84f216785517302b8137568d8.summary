by @entity0 the little boy lolls listlessly in his father ’s arms , a feeding tube leading from his nose to some kind of apparatus on the bedside table			1
not in pain apparently but clearly not well either			2
by contrast , the child ’s father seems animated , positive even			1
believing he has given both @entity14 officials and @entity16 police the slip			1
you can hear – heartbreakingly – in his voice the relief that at last he is doing something			2
in the social media video he released , @entity23 even refers to his son @entity25 as ‘ healthy ’ , and says he is doing better than he was in hospital			1
after months of watching , waiting and praying , this loving father has taken matters into his own hands , believing that against all odds , in defiance of the most expert of medical advice , that he is saving his son			1
now @entity25 is back under formal medical care while his parents @entity23 , 51 , and @entity59 , 45 , are expected to fight an extradition order which would return the family to @entity47 and subject their son – the youngest of their seven children – to medical protocols in which they no longer have any faith			1
the @entity55 judge who will hear their case faces a real - life judgment of @entity73			1
on the one hand , the parents say they are attempting to take their son to treatment centres in @entity78 to hopefully cure him with a form of therapy which they claim is being denied by the @entity14 on the grounds of cost			1
on the other hand , the specialists at @entity54 say that in the case of @entity25 , who suffers from a brain tumour known as medulloblastoma , the targeted form of radiation therapy wo n’t do any good and that removing the boy from their care has endangered him further			1
on first glance this sounds like an open - and - shut medical decision : either the @entity98 doctors or @entity25 ’s parents are right			1
but , as anyone who has sat by the bedside of a gravely ill child knows , the truth is that there is nothing on earth more likely to make you become unhinged than to see your child suffer and be unable to prevent it			2
and that is a truth complicated by the fact that medicine – when it concerns the cutting - edge treatment of terminally - ill children – is as much an art as a science , with issues rarely being straightforwardly black or white			1
or as one of the consultants told me when my elder daughter @entity125 was treated for leukaemia : ‘ being a good doctor is as much like being a good cook as anything			2
you have to feel your way			2
’ when a child is diagnosed with something as serious as cancer , the usual procedure is to start with the treatment protocols agreed by specialists all over the world			1
some children respond well straight away			2
cancer is not just one disease but many hundreds of diseases under one heading , and something that looks like other similar cases may respond very differently			0
i have been that parent , the one repeatedly called in to hear the consultant say : ‘ it has n’t turned out as we hoped , ’ which is how they tell you when treatment has n’t worked and they are thinking of trying something else			1
so you return to the ward , where other children may be packing their bags to go home and your child is getting sicker for reasons you ca n’t fully understand without years of medical training and maybe not even then			0
not only that but , without a full understanding of what is happening , you are required to sign consent forms for operations that do n’t seem to be helping and , worse , calm your child while they have injections and painful procedures which they beg you to stop			2
when every fibre of your being is telling you to protect your child , the medical world orders you to over-ride those feelings over and over again in the interests of something that does n’t appear to be having much effect			0
and , to compound this nightmarish scenario , you are probably sleeping – if it can be called that – on a fold - up bed next to your child ; washing in the hospital ’s visitors ’ loos and living on a diet of chips from the canteen , not having breathed fresh air or had a night off since the dreadful day of diagnosis			0
if you have other children , they will be distraught , missing both their unwell sibling and you			0
and if you have a partner , your relationship will almost certainly be suffering as you take your understandable anxiety out on each other			0
@entity191 , who underwent an operation on a brain tumour last month , in hospital with his mother @entity195 in a photo posted on @entity197 by a relative it ’s a recipe for disaster and to me the only surprise is that runaways like this do n’t happen more often			0
i spent eight months with @entity125 in hospital before she died aged nine			0
and at 3am every night , every other parent there was , like me , awake but face - down on the pillow , shoulders shaking with sobs that could n’t be shed during the day			0
any of us who said that in those wee small hours we did n’t contemplate doing something desperate would be lying			0
but , thankfully , in the cold light of day , sanity would return			0
looking back , i regard those months on the ward as a form of well - intentioned torture			0
@entity25 had apparently only recently had another operation and i wonder if perhaps his parents – who had been keeping a bedside vigil – are suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress			1
during my time at @entity226 ’s @entity225 , one of the fathers became obsessed with the idea that his daughter had developed leukaemia due to supposed – and entirely imaginary – radioactive water in the water supply			0
he persisted with his mania for three weeks before anyone could convince him otherwise			0
and , of course , parents can become obsessed with the idea that they know more than their doctors			0
in the area of childhood cancers , the @entity14 is rightly regarded as world - beating			1
the fact that treatment is free is a reason for its brilliance because countries with paid - for medical services rarely have the incentive to tackle hard - to - treat cases in children , preferring to develop cures for ailments suffered by older , richer patients			2
even so , very occasionally a second , third or fourth opinion overseas can throw a lifeline to children with cancer and wealthy parents who can effectively shop the world for treatment options ( with the permission of their own doctors ) are popularly regarded as heroic			2
the sort of desperate action taken by @entity51 ’s family is just that – desperate			0
anyone who has balked at taking their toddler for a little jab or who has abandoned a course of drug treatment halfway through due to unpleasant side - effects has no right to criticise @entity25 ’s parents for their admittedly dramatic and possibly foolhardy reaction to what they believed they had discovered online			1
the fact that the stakes are so high for @entity25 should only serve to make it clear how much mental turmoil his parents are suffering			1
it would have been better all round , particularly for little @entity25 , if the medical staff in @entity54 had managed to keep his parents on - side as they investigated – no doubt with a great deal of expertise and care – all the treatment options			1
from my knowledge of that father in @entity225 who was convinced about radiation in the water supply , i suspect that may have been no easy task			2
even so , it is for the paid professionals , who sleep in their own beds each night without the sword of fate hanging over their children , to be the ones who communicate well and patiently and who make good decisions			0
because , what is undeniably true is that the @entity309 may have become misguided in their distress but they are adoring parents who have risked everything for their child			0
criminalising them by arresting them was an abhorrently cruel over-reaction			0

@entity321 *confirmed* @entity25 has been found alive in @entity55
father @entity23 recorded a video explaining why they had gone on the run
urged police to stop the ' ridiculous chase ' and asked to be ' left in peace '
said the @entity14 had not been able to give the treatment they wanted for son
