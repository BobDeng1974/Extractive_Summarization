@entity8 was distraught when she lost her first child to the heart defect - which occurs in fewer than one in every 10,000 births			1
the 21 - year - old then suffered a miscarriage before having her second child , @entity15 - only for him to die of the same condition just over a fortnight later			2
grief : @entity8 lost her first child @entity9 ( pictured ) to a rare heart condition - and his brother 18 months later loss : miss @entity8 then suffered a miscarriage before having her second child , @entity23 ( pictured ) - only for him to die of the same condition just over a fortnight later both babies suffered from a condition called truncus arteriosus type ii , a congenital heart defect which requires open heart surgery in infancy for the child to stand any chance of surviving			1
miss @entity8 and partner @entity32 , 45 of @entity33 , @entity34 , twice faced the heartbreaking decision to switch off the babies ' life support after surgery failed			1
doctors picked up on the first child 's condition at @entity8 's 20 - week - scan , discovering she had a hole in her heart			1
just two days after @entity9 was born in july 2012 the couple received the devastating news that their daughter would not pull through			2
they were told all doctors could do was make her comfortable and try to prolong her life as much as they could			0
battle : ms @entity8 and partner @entity23			1
both of their children were suffering from truncus arteriosus type ii , a congenital heart defect @entity58 arteriosus @entity57 means a child is born with abnormal development of the blood vessels which emerge from the heart			1
the child will initially suffer from heart failure , which manifest as rapid breathing , poor feeding and failure to gain weight and grow properly			2
damage of the blood vessels of the lung leads to less blood flow which eventually causes death			0
@entity8 made the heart wrenching decision to turn off the bypass machine that was keeping their four - month - old alive			1
' after @entity9 passed away they just said it could be a one off , so i thought we should try for another child , " @entity8 added			1
' but then i had my son and he ends up with the same condition			2
' we were so shocked when we got told this as we were told he was a healthy wee boy			0
' it was just the same nightmare again			0
it has been really tough			0
' they said he was fine but he had the same condition as his sister , i would like to make all parents aware that the scans do n't pick up everything			0
' the couple were relieved that initial scans revealed no heart problems with their son @entity15			2
however after his birth hospital doctors suspected he may have a heart murmur			0
further tests confirmed he was suffering from the same rare heart defect as his late sister , he required an operation but complications arose			1
surgeons discovered that the two - week - old 's heart was not strong enough for him to pull through and he died on 21st december			0

doctors are now investigating if there is a genetic link that caused the rare condition to occur twice			0
leaving @entity8 and @entity23 to face an anxious wait for results of blood tests before deciding whether to try for another child			1
the couple now make regular visits to the cemetery in @entity147 , seven miles west of @entity33 , where their two children are buried alongside each other .			0

@entity8 lost her first child @entity9 to a rare congential heart defect
then miscarried before losing her son @entity23 to the same condition
