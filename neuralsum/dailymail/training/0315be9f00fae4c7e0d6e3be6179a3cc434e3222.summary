by @entity0 a 15 - year - old girl who encouraged her autistic boyfriend to shave off his eyebrows , have sex with the family dog and walk across dangerously - thin ice on a frozen lake - all while filming him - has been sentenced to a maximum of six years in a state juvenile detention			1
the unnamed teen , who was reportedly dating the boy , received the sentence in @entity13 , @entity14 on thursday after previously pleading guilty to second - degree assault and displaying an obscene photograph of a boy			1
she was arrested last month with a friend , 17 - year - old @entity18 , after a classmate at @entity20 learned about the videos in which they allegedly tormented the boy			1
@entity24 has been charged as an adult with first - degree assault , false imprisonment and child - pornography solicitation			1
she faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted - but her parents and lawyers are battling for her to be charged as a juvenile instead			1
on thursday , before the 15 - year - old was sentenced , she had asked the judge to be placed in a community - based treatment program , rather than jail			1
' i just feel a not - lockdown facility is going to be best for me , ' the girl , dressed in a pink hoodie , said			1
' of course you do , ' judge @entity55 responded sarcastically , the @entity40 noted			2
he ignored her pleas for leniency and branded her treatment of the boy ' horrific '			1
he said she posed a danger to the community			0
she will now remain at a secure juvenile facility until she is 21 - but she could be released before if authorities deem that her rehabilitation is progressing quickly , the @entity40 reported			1

he said he considers @entity24 and the 15 - year - old girl , who was his girlfriend , to be his friends			1
' it really makes me upset that my parents want to see them in jail , ' he told the @entity40 in an earlier interview			2
' because i really like them			0
' he said the girls never intended to kill him - even when they held a knife to his neck and led him to a frozen lake and persuaded him to fetch a basketball on the ice			1
minutes later , he fell through the ice and screamed , but the girls did nothing to help , he said			2
afterwards , they would n't allow him to ride with them and he returned home wet			0
' they put me in the trunk , ' he said			0
' they did n't want to get the interior wet			0
' his parents , however , said they want @entity24 to be tried as an adult			2
' my son is a staunch defender of his tormentors ; itâ € ™ s embarrassing , ' his father told the @entity40			0
' he may be more disabled than i convinced myself that he was and maybe more lost than i realized			0
that 's something i am going to have to deal with on a later day			0
right now , i am trying to get justice for him and others like him			0
' their cruel treatment was uncovered after a fellow student heard about the videos and told school authorities			0
on march 10 , sheriff 's deputies confiscated the younger girl 's phone and both were arrested			2
sheriff @entity124 told @entity125 that the allegations leveled against the girls are among the most disturbing he has dealt with in his career			2

' i do n't know			0
it 's hard to fathom , really			0
