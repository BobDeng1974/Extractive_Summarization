according to the history books , five mass extinctions have devastated the planet since it formed 4.6 billion years ago			1
but history may have to be rewritten after the discovery of fossils that point to a sixth mass extinction taking place 260 million years ago			1
the find suggests that in the @entity12 period , the world ’s creature were almost wiped out twice : once during the ‘ @entity16 ’ and in an earlier event named the ' @entity15 ' mass extinction			1
history may have to be rewritten after the discovery of fossils which point to a sixth mass extinction that took place 260 million years ago			1
the fossils were found in the @entity12 rocks of the @entity21 ( pictured ) at @entity22 which reveal the record of the high latitude middle @entity15 extinction the @entity16 was the worst extinction event of all time killing off 96 per cent of species			1
today , all life on @entity29 is descended from the remaining four per cent of species that survived			0
now researchers from the universities of @entity33 and @entity34 say there is evidence of a major marine extinction in the @entity38 just eight million years before the @entity16			1
an extinction event around this time has been the subject of previous studies , but this is the first to document the event in high latitudes			0
' one of the pre-requisites for a “ mass extinction ” is that it has to be a global event , ' professor @entity45 from the @entity46 told @entity52			1
professor @entity45 and his colleague @entity54 from the @entity34 found evidence of the extinction in fossils in @entity58 , @entity22 ( left )			2
they studied them in layers of rock ( right ) , identifying the species present and building up what they described as ' a range chart ' the find suggests that in the @entity12 period , the world ’s creature were almost wiped out twice			2
pictured is a fossil skull of @entity73 , sitting on a gravel pile			0
the fossil is one of many @entity76 which did not survive the @entity12 extinction , one of the most disastrous extinctions known ' our study confirms it is a global event , and so we can now say for sure that the event is a true mass extinction			2
' professor @entity45 and his colleague @entity54 from the @entity34 found evidence of the extinction in fossils in @entity58 , @entity22			2
they studied them in layers of rock , identifying the species present and building up what they described as ' a range chart '			2
' at a particular layer , many of the different species disappear , ' explained professor @entity45			0
' this can be spread over several layers - and indeed hundreds of thousands of years - or can be in a single layer			0
' together , the fossils suggest 50 per cent of all marine species died during the event			1
‘ we can now say this is a real global mass extinction , ’ professor @entity45 said after reporting his findings over the weekend at the @entity105 meeting in @entity106 , @entity107			2
meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on @entity29 @entity115 - @entity114 mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in @entity29 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years			1
around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 - 88 per cent of all species			2
late @entity124 mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on @entity29 died out in the @entity127 , though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years			1
around 22 per cent of all marine families , and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 - 87 per cent of all species			2
permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the @entity15 mass extinction has been nicknamed @entity16 , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out			1
all life on @entity29 today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			0
@entity140 - @entity139 mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the @entity140 - @entity139 mass extinction event			1
22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76 - 84 per cent of all species			0
@entity149 - tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago the @entity151 mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs			1
however , many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71 - 81 per cent of all species			0
the @entity12 extinction may have weakened species , causing the @entity16 to have a much more fatal impact than it might otherwise have had , he added			1
a number of theories have been proposed for extinction events during the @entity15 including asteroid impact , volcanic eruptions , methane release or some combination of these			0
' we see the loss of carbonates in the aftermath of the extinction across the whole @entity38 region – this is consistent with ocean acidification as a kill mechanism in the high latitudes , ' said professor @entity45			0
' this could have been caused by excessive @entity181 release from the @entity183 volcanism which gets absorbed by sea water and drives @entity185 down			0
' the volcanism would also have caused cooling and warming ( both but over different timescales ) , acid rain , ozone depletion , many other factors – currently we do n’t know which of these were responsible			0
' the @entity15 mass extinction has been nicknamed @entity16 , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out			1
all life on @entity29 today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			0
pictured are sail - backed @entity199 , which were alive during @entity29 's @entity12 period of time professor @entity45 is now hoping for the earlier @entity12 event to be added to the ' big five ' mass extinctions that have so far hit @entity29			0
some scientists claim @entity29 is already in the midst of another mass extinction event , caused by humans who have already killed off over 320 species			1
the planet 's current biodiversity , the product of 3.5 billion years of evolutionary trial and error , is the highest in the history of life			0
in a study published in july , researchers at @entity218 said @entity29 has reached a tipping point and is in the early stages of a mass extinction event since 1500 , more than 320 terrestrial vertebrates have become extinct			2
populations of the remaining species show a 25 per cent average decline in abundance			0
the discovery was made in @entity22 , the largest and only permanently populated island of the @entity230 archipelago in northern @entity231			0

@entity234 scientists studied fossils found in layers of rock in @entity22
they suggest 50 per cent of marine species died 260 million years ago
devastating event has been named the ' @entity15 ' mass extinction
it may have weakened species , causing the @entity16 to be more fatal
