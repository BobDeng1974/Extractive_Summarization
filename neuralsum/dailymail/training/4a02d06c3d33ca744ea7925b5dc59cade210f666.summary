published : 12:09 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 11 april 2013 @entity1 landlord @entity0 planter dropped 10ft off the wall			1
the painter and decorator suffered severe head injuries and spent two and a half months in hospital			1
she was left with a fractured spine and broken ribs following the incident on october 3 , 2010			1
mrs @entity10 is now on the mend but prosecutor @entity24 said at @entity25 : ' she is unlikely to ever be able to return to her former work			1
' @entity27 , 34 , who owns the pub , admitted negligence for failing to ensure punters were not exposed to risk			2
he and his company were fined a total of £ 70,000			2
@entity25 heard the planter was on the first - floor windowsill of the gastro pub. but a guest who was staying in the hotel upstairs opened the window further than he should have been able to dislodging the pot , causing it to crash to the ground			2
mr @entity44 said : ' it weighed 54 kilos ( 8.5 stone ) and fell 2.7m			2
' it struck @entity10 who was sitting underneath enjoying a drink			1
' there was awning above so anyone sitting underneath would have been completely unaware of what was above them			2
' it was just a bolt from the blue			2
' the court heard the planter , which had an artificial tree in it , was weighed down with sand and concrete so it did not buckle in the wind			2
mr @entity0 , who runs the pub and the @entity63 above with his family , thought it was ' unthinkable ' anything like this could ever happen			0
@entity68 , defending , said the company director had since undertaken numerous health and safety training			0
he added : ' he and his family are truly sorry about this tragic accident leading to mrs @entity10 's tragic injuries			1
' they were horrified and surprised by the circumstances			0
' this was a combination of poor judgement and lack of appreciation to what the risks could be which inevitably lead to this dreadful accident			1
' a judge heard it was a ' cruel irony ' that had the windows been changed in 2009 , without which the incident would never have occurred			0
@entity10 was drinking with friends at @entity88 in @entity12 , @entity13 ( pictured ) when the plant pot fell on her head in august 2010 sentencing mr @entity0 , judge @entity91 said : ' i have to begin with @entity10 , whose life has been so dramatically and sadly altered by what happened that day			1
' one moment she was sitting and drinking with her friends , the next she suffered serious and potentially fatal injuries			0
' she spent two and a half months in hospital and now finds herself unable to live the life she enjoyed			1
' that planter , for three years , had been sitting in a position which carried a very forseeable risk of injury and death			0
' this should have been prevented			0
had the defendant had better training i have no doubt he would have appreciated this accident could have taken place			1
' mr @entity0 was personally fined £ 15,000 while his company will have to pay £ 55,000			0
they must also pay the prosecution costs of £ 26,500			0
since the accident all planters from the pub have been removed			1
the @entity27 family have also been paying for mrs @entity10 's rehabilitative care through their insurers			1
@entity121 , of @entity122 , said : ‘ this was a very serious case and the level of the fines handed down by the court shows how seriously the judge took the matter			0
‘ we hope it will serve to demonstrate the dangers of disregarding health and safety and planning law and the devastating affect it can have on people ’s lives			0
‘ in this case , glaring neglect of health and safety responsibilities coupled with the director ’s decision to ignore clear orders to change the windows have resulted in a woman ’s life being changed forever			0
‘ if a retractable canopy had not broken the fall of the planter we could easily have been talking about a fatality			0
