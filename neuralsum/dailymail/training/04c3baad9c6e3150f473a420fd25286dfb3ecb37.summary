it 's november , and i 'm sitting on a seaside terrace , enjoying an alfresco lunch of succulent fresh fish , fries and a fruity glass of white wine - and i 'm not even wearing a coat			0
but since the restaurant - @entity9 in @entity11 - is just a few miles south of @entity12 , one of the world 's most glamorous resorts , i am wearing my @entity16 , bling-fest earrings and a generous slick of @entity20 lipstick			1
to be honest , compared with the chic and slim @entity22 women gliding in and out of @entity24 , each with a cute dog under one arm , i still look très scruffy			2
but it 's the thought that counts			0
think of @entity12 , on the @entity30 in south - west @entity22 , and the memory retrieves images of handsome @entity34 blue - bloods and @entity36 royalty sipping cocktails and cavorting by a pool			1
high and handsome : the @entity39 adds an extra dash of charm to @entity12 's dazzling shoreline still at the heart of all this glitz and glamour is the @entity46 , standing in splendid isolation by @entity48			1

staff at @entity39 are far too discreet to disclose recent guests			2
during my visit , private jet - loads of well - off @entity67 were roaming around as @entity12 played host to a glitzy ball			1
a weekend of indulgence here should start in the massive @entity74 , which has a fabulous indoor pool			0
in 1858 , @entity22 perfume house @entity76 was chosen by @entity78 to create an @entity79 , and for € 120 ( about £ 95 ) , you can experience it during a 50 - minute @entity82			1
starry : @entity60 stayed at the @entity39 and if your hair looks past its best after a spot of surfing in the ocean , the @entity86 treatment , which costs between € 120 and € 180 ( £ 95 to £ 140 ) , at the on - site @entity84 should sort it			1
after all , you must look your best for dinner in the @entity95 - starred @entity39 restaurant			1
in fact , with its grand chandeliered @entity99 , 150 elegant rooms and suites , and classy service , the @entity39 makes you want to dress up			2
fascinatingly , you can learn how the authentic furniture and furnishings are kept looking tip - top on a visit to the hotel 's workshops			0
renovating just one of the rooms costs between € 90,000 and € 350,000 ( £ 70,800 to £ 275,000 ) , we learn			0
there are plenty of tempting boutiques in @entity12 , should your own wardrobe need an overhaul - or why not pop over to @entity114 ? the border is just 30 minutes away by car			1
while you are there , you could learn about @entity119 culture at the @entity120 , housed in a 16th century convent in the middle of picturesque @entity123			0
back in @entity12 , we stopped for hot chocolate at @entity125 - the grand cafe dates from 1872 and was a favourite of @entity128 , who also stayed at the @entity39			1
energy levels topped up , we went for a long walk along the seafront , past the splendid @entity133 casino			0
many of those we passed were wearing bling			0
