the @entity0 has uncovered a secret plan to double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients			1
the current target is for an emergency vehicle to reach those in life - threatening situations within eight minutes			2
but a document seen by this newspaper reveals that the target time to get to those suffering a range of serious problems including strokes and seizures is to be increased to 19 minutes			1
last night leading doctors said the scheme – designed to make it easier for ambulance services to hit targets they have missed for months – risked lives			1
however , they discussed bringing the plan forward at a series of secret high - level meetings , because of ‘ unprecedented pressure ’ on emergency services			1
the revelations come as the @entity25 faces a wider winter crisis with top medics warning : ‘ do n’t get ill this @entity44			1
’ this newspaper has found that : according to the leaked document , drawn up by the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , @entity25 has agreed ‘ in principle ’ to relax the maximum ambulance wait for what are known as ‘ @entity52 ’ incidents			1
it stated the organisation ‘ had a firm position that any changes would be made after the @entity34 ’			2
but earlier this month , professor @entity57 of @entity25 called a series of tele - conferences to ‘ scope the feasibility ’ of relaxing the targets sooner , due to what the memo described as ‘ unprecedented demand ’			1
each year , ambulance services deal with almost three million @entity68 incidents , deemed to be ‘ serious but not the most life - threatening ’			1
they include conditions such as strokes , seizures and many car crash situations			0
the document - given to the @entity0 by a whistleblower - revealed plans to lengthen waiting times the only higher category is @entity79 1 ‘ immediately life threatening ’ incidents – such as cardiac arrest , choking , and major bleeding – of which there are about 150,000 incidents a year			1
doctors say it is often very hard to tell if a situation is immediately life threatening or not over the phone			0
red 1 incidents are up 25 per cent compared to this time last year			2
eight of @entity25 ’s regional ambulance services are at a ‘ severe pressure ’ alert level and the other two – @entity98 and @entity99 ’ – are ‘ critical ’			1
the only higher level is ‘ service failure ’			1
as a result of the closed - door tele - conferences , at which it was ‘ explicitly stressed ’ that discussions should remain secret , ambulance services will get more time to assess @entity68 calls			1
they will get three minutes before the ‘ clock starts ’ on target times , rather than one minute as they do now			2
this change could be brought in during january			0
this proposal and others ‘ received approval ’ from health secretary @entity117 last monday , the memo states			2
it means from january ambulances will have a total of 11 minutes to reach a red 2 patient before breaching the @entity123 target , rather than nine			0
the plan to change target times to 19 minutes has yet to be agreed			1
last night , former @entity25 heart ‘ tsar ’ professor sir @entity128 , who helped halve deaths from heart attacks , said he believed the moves would ‘ risk lives ’			1
‘ the way to deal with the crisis is not to take longer to deal with the calls , ’ he said			2
the @entity48 argues relaxing waiting times will enable more fully equipped ambulances to be sent out first time , rather than ‘ fast responder ’ cars , which are sometimes sent out just to meet targets			1
and it says giving more assessment time will also lead to ‘ better decisions ’ about what to send			1
but a senior @entity25 clinician said : ‘ this is a degradation of the response times standard for political purposes to get everybody out of a jam			1
’ shadow health secretary @entity154 accused mr @entity117 of ‘ moving the goalposts ’ on ambulance waiting time targets			1
the @entity159 target – of reaching 75 per cent of such patients in eight minutes – has not been met since april			2
the @entity68 target has not been met since january			2
mr @entity154 said : ‘ rather than getting ambulance response times back up to established standards , it looks like he is running up the white flag			2
‘ mr @entity117 ’s decision risks leaving thousands of seriously ill people waiting longer for ambulances this winter			2
’ meanwhile , leading medics warned people to try to avoid ending up in hospital over @entity44 if they could possibly help it			1
prof @entity128 said : ‘ do n’t get ill over the next couple of weeks			0
’ he said that hospitals became ‘ log - jammed ’ over the extended break because it was even harder than normal to move elderly patients out of hospital , as social care workers were on holiday			1
dr @entity182 , chief executive of the @entity183 , said : ‘ the people who are really going to feel it are older people – the frail elderly , perhaps with chest infections			2
these are the people who end up on trolleys for hours on end			0
’ dr @entity189 , chair of the @entity190 , said the @entity25 gave ‘ good service to the people of this country ’			1
but he added : ‘ the fact that we can only do so , by running many hospitals on a continuous sense of crisis shows how close to the wire we are at all times			2
’ amid the growing problems , virologists fear flu could soon worsen matters further , with pre-christmas flu levels now at a three - year high , according to official figures			0
last night a @entity208 spokesman said that mr @entity117 had made ‘ no decisions ’ yet and that the ambulance service had been given an extra £ 50 million to cope with this winter			1
professor @entity57 , head of acute care for @entity25 , said last night : ‘ any operational changes would need to be proposed by the senior doctors running ambulance services and agreed by the @entity25 nationally			1
' no such decisions have been taken on their proposals , nor will they be until next year			0
’ my little @entity219 could have died if ambulance was delayed , by prof sir @entity128 prof sir @entity128 warned the country needs more ambulances and paramedics on the road in may , just before her first birthday , my granddaughter @entity219 had a fit			1
then she had a respiratory arrest			0
@entity231 responded very , very promptly			0
they were there within four minutes			0
@entity219 had to be fully resuscitated by paramedics , and they saved her life			0
had they taken longer to get to us , it is likely she would not have survived			0
her case could have been classed as an immediately life - threatening ‘ @entity241 ’ call , or it might not have been			0
it would probably have been classed as a lower priority ‘ @entity68 ’ call , because @entity219 had a fit and the reason for her collapse was unspecified			1
the 999 call handlers would not have been able to make the distinction with an extra two minutes of conversation on the phone			0
‘ @entity68 ’ incidents like fits and stroke are still life - threatening situations , and those few minutes can mean the difference between life and death			1
the whole point of the @entity260 is that we should be treating stroke as an emergency			0
the time it takes to get treatment is as critical for stroke as it is for heart attack			0
so i think loosening ambulance response times is going down a very dangerous path , and will risk lives			2
furthermore , it ’s an admission of defeat			0
i have full sympathy with the ambulance services – they are under major pressure			1
but the way to deal with the crisis is not to take longer to deal with calls			0
just as we need more beds and staff in hospitals , so we need more ambulances and paramedics on the road			0
this problem gets straight to the nub of where we are with the @entity25 at the moment			0
historically , international comparisons show that – in terms of national health care institutions – the @entity25 is the best in the world			2
but it ’s running into serious trouble			0
not enough money is being pumped in to keep pace with ever - rising demand			0
disastrous reforms brought in by former health secretary @entity304 have not helped			0
we need to invest more in the health service to get the show back on the road			0
but is the government prepared to do that ? @entity311 is now 19 months old and a beautiful , healthy toddler			0
yesterday , she and her parents came over for tea			0
as a family we can not thank the ambulance service enough for being there , the very minute we needed them .			0

ambulance crews are to be given more time to respond to incidents
secret memo revealed targets may be increased from eight to 19 minutes
' @entity68 ' incidents , the second most serious , would be affected by change
senior @entity25 doctors warned the scheme could risk patients ' lives
comes as the emergency services face *widespread* crisis this winter
two ambulance services , covering 12 million people , are at a ‘ critical ’ alert level – with @entity98 saying it will not send crews to those with broken arms or women in ‘ routine *labour* ’ .
at least a dozen hospitals across @entity25 are on ‘ black alert ’ – meaning they are totally full , leading to *pre-planned* operations being cancelled .
patients who might have cancer are being ‘ *bounced* back ’ from hospitals , told they are ‘ not *urgent* ’ cases and must wait up four months for vital tests
new ‘ *super-strains* ’ of flu – against which the flu jab seems to provide little *protection* – are starting to sweep across the country .
