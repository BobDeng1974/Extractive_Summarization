by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 9:16 am on 13th december 2011 @entity3 became the incredible sulk of @entity6 politics yesterday by snubbing @entity8 ’s triumphant appearance in the @entity9			1
the prime minister was cheered by @entity11 for his historic veto of a new @entity14 treaty at the @entity16 summit			2
his pro-eu deputy ducked yesterday ’s session , telling mr @entity8 he would be a ‘ distraction ’ on the @entity21 front bench			1
snub : @entity3 , pictured leaving the @entity9 , said last night that he did not appear in the @entity22 for @entity8 's statement as he thought he would be a ' distraction ' triumphant : @entity8 was in full flow yesterday as he explained his historic veto of a new @entity14 treaty , saying he was right to ' defend @entity6 's national interest ' instead , he took to the tv studios to accuse the prime minister of endangering the livelihoods of millions of @entity6 by risking isolation in @entity33			1
attack : @entity35 said mr @entity8 's decision was ' the biggest mistake of @entity6 in @entity33 in a generation ' during his reply to the prime minister mr @entity3 is understood to be demanding that the @entity6 begin a ‘ process of building bridges and re-engagement ’ in @entity16			1
pressed about the deputy prime minister ’s absence , mr @entity8 told mps : ‘ i ’m not responsible for his whereabouts			1

mr @entity8 insisted he had been right to stick to his word and ‘ defend @entity6 ’s national interest ’			1
he made clear he thinks @entity14 leaders have got it wrong on the euro – but he went out of his way not to offend @entity52			0

in what some took as a swipe at mr @entity3 , who initially backed mr @entity8 ’s stance before howls of protest from senior @entity52 , the prime minister added : ‘ i did exactly what i said i was going to do			1
apparently in politics these days , that ’s very surprising			0
praise : @entity89 , left , said @entity6 was much stronger because mr @entity8 was not afraid to say ' no ' , while sir @entity90 expressed his ' full - hearted support ' for the prime minister debate : members filled the @entity9 benches yesterday afternoon to hear mr @entity8 's statement before many offered support from both sides of the @entity22 ‘ conservatives and @entity99 @entity52 have not always agreed about @entity33 integration but we have both set aside our interests to work in the national interest of having a government that is able to clear up the mess that @entity105 left			1
‘ @entity6 remains a full member of the @entity14 and the events of last week do nothing to change that			2
our membership of the @entity14 is vital to our national interest			0
’ but he added : ‘ the balance of powers between @entity6 and @entity33 is n’t right and there are powers i would like to see returned			0
’ mr @entity3 said it did not matter who sat where in the @entity9 and added : ‘ i would have been a distraction if i was there ... i have made my views clear about @entity6 ’s isolation at the summit last week			1
‘ i have made it very clear that i think isolation in @entity33 , where we are one against 26 , is potentially a bad thing for jobs , a bad thing for growth and a bad thing for the livelihoods of millions of people in this country			0
‘ when i was told the outcome of the summit , after it finished , i immediately told the prime minister that i could not welcome it , that i thought it was bad for @entity6			1
i have stayed with that view since , and i have simply amplified on my reasons for that since the summit			0
’ @entity99 dem business secretary @entity143 , who was in the @entity9 , has also vowed to launch an offensive to keep @entity6 in @entity33 – saying the government ’s policy can not be to ‘ cut off its nose to spite its face ’			0
conservative mps lined up to applaud the prime minister ’s stance			1
sir @entity90 expressed ‘ admiration and full - hearted support at this definitive moment in his first premiership ’			0
@entity157 former cabinet minister @entity89 said : ‘ @entity6 has much more negotiating strength today , because @entity33 knows that it is dealing with a prime minister who will say “ no ” if he needs to			1
’ conservative mp @entity161 praised mr @entity8 ’s ‘ bulldog spirit ’			2
labour leader @entity35 however attacked mr @entity8 for what he called ‘ the biggest mistake of @entity6 in @entity33 for a generation ’			1
@entity52 @entity166 said that a general election was needed to ‘ clear the air ’ between the conservatives and the @entity52			0
she criticised mr @entity3 ’s failure to appear in the @entity9 , saying : ‘ he should have been there and stuck it out frankly			2
‘ he is the deputy leader of that government			0
he should have been there			0
’ @entity175 said yesterday : ‘ there are clearly two @entity177			0
one that wants more solidarity among its members and more regulation			0
the other which is attached only to the logic of the single market			0
’ he added that he and @entity186 chancellor @entity185 had done everything they could to keep @entity6 on board – implying mr @entity8 did not want a deal			1
