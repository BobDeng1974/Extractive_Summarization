when the largest shopping centre in the world opened in 2005 , it was dubbed the @entity3 of @entity4 , and around 70,000 shoppers were expected to flock there each day			1
the @entity6 seemed to have it all : an 82ft @entity8 , a 1.3 - mile canal complete with gondolas , and an enormous indoor and outdoor roller - coaster			2
there was only one thing missing : the shops			0
occupancy rate at the 7m square feet mall - the largest in the world in terms of leasable space and more than twice as big as the largest mall in the @entity36 , the @entity29 - is still lying at one per cent			1
those who hoped the @entity6 would herald a new dawn in which @entity4 would consume what it produced , rather than simply export it , have seen their hopes dashed			2
the mall was dreamt up - and paid for - by @entity42 , a @entity21 native who became a billionaire selling instant noodles			0
it was designed around seven zones , each representing a city , country or area : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and the @entity57			0
designers were sent around the world for two years scouting for good locations for zones , and car park spaces were built for all the shoppers who would drive there			0
covered in dust : decorations put up years ago still hang from the ceiling empty as the day it opened : there 's only litter in the shopping centre 's corridors but the project never took off , and eight years on , it is still lying fallow			1
( meanwhile the largest shopping centre in the world by total area , the @entity77 , is now the world 's most visited shopping and leisure destination with more than 54m visitors a year			1
) in the @entity26 mall , sheets lie draped over unmoving escalators , old decorations still hang , covered in dust , and the only movement is the odd crisp packet blown by the wind along an empty corridor			0
instead of shop assistants , the few people employed in the echoing centre are security guards paid to sit on chairs and keep vandals out			2
how it should have looked : a map of the shopping centre at the beginning impressive entrance : the 82ft @entity8 outside the empty mall no shops , no shoppers : one corridor after another lies empty a handful of businesses still operate , mostly fast - food restaurants to serve the families who bring their children to the amusement park and @entity113 cinema outside the mall			1
but the vast majority of the mall , including what should have been a gleaming hotel for all the destination shoppers , remains empty			0
@entity26 retail experts say one of the problems is the lack of transport infrastructure to bring the shoppers in			2
shrouded in sheets : the empty mall is home to security guards @entity131 wasteland : outside the shopping mall the ground is untended busier outside : families visit the amusement park and @entity113 cinema outside the shopping centre now known as the ' new ' @entity6 ( the ' new ' was added in a failed relaunch in 2007 ) , it does n't lie on any major transport network or nearby airport , and can take hours to get to via public transport , even for those living a short distance away			1
a reporter who wrote this detailed account of the mall for @entity148 said it took him more than two - and - a - half hours to get to the mall by bus from six miles away			0
but even if the locals could get there , they might not want to			0
@entity21 has a population of more than 10m , but with most of the inhabitants working in the city 's factories , they do not have deep enough pockets to do justice to a a high - end shopping centre			1
@entity4 has also been badly hit by the global recession , with its export market suffering from the financial woes of the @entity36 and @entity166			2
the mall is now owned by the @entity168 , a division of @entity169 , but any plans they have for its future remain to be seen			0
not much to buy here : empty shopfronts in the @entity4 @entity176 canal : the mall boasts more than a mile of canals which shoppers were to enjoy on gondolas @entity182 employee : a female security guard keeps lookout against vandals fast food : @entity187 is one of the few retailers in situ at the shopping centre unfulfilled dream : the mall was dreamt up by local instant noodle billionaire @entity42 the shoppers never came : eight years after it was launched , the retail centre is still empty video : look around the eerie @entity6			1

new @entity6 twice as large as the biggest in @entity36 , @entity29
shopping centre 's poor location with bad transport links *blamed* for failure
