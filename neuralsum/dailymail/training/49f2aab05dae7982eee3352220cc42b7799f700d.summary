by @entity0 ‘ disco clams ’ were recently caught on camera ' partying ' on the ocean floor while producing their own strobe light effects			2
and now one scientist , who first came across the entertaining mollusc four years ago , has discovered the secret of how it lights up			0
@entity11 ales , dubbed disco clams because of this unique feature , produce the effect using its lips - which is packed with tiny spheres of reflective silica - like a mirror ball			1
when the clams are in a bright area of the ocean these cells reflect the light , making it look like it ’s coming directly from the clam			0
the clams mainly reflect blue light , which can be seen further away in the ocean than other light wavelengths			2
@entity42 encountered the two - inch clam in 2010 while diving with her mother and sister in @entity47 , @entity48			0
she saw @entity11 ales roll the edge of its mantle - a layer of muscle and tissue that acts like a cloak over the mollusc 's body - and produce a strobe - light effect using its mirrored lips			1
@entity42 , a dive instructor and graduate student at the @entity61 , said : ‘ i 've dived with humpback whales and great white sharks			0
‘ but when i saw the disco clam , i was enamoured			2
i said then , “ i 'm going to do a phd on the disco clam			2
” ’ @entity11 ales are found in tropical areas of the @entity68 , living in crevices in reefs , typically in clusters of two or more			1
light is dim and blue - green at the clams ' typical depth , which ranges from 10 - 150 feet ( 3 to 50m ) but their rippling mirrored lips are visible even without artificial illumination			2
lips like a disco ball : scientist and driving instructor @entity42 discovered that the mirrored lips are composed of packed nanospheres ideal for reflecting the blue light prevalent underwater			1
but she is not sure why the ' disco clams ' ( pictured ) produce the light show it did n't take long for the scientist to confirm that the flashing was not a form of bioluminescence , which is a chemical reaction inside animals like plankton that produces light similar to that of a glow stick			0
instead , she found , the edge of the clam 's mantle lip is highly reflective on one side			1
when the clam unfurls its lip - typically twice a second - the millimetre - wide mirror is revealed and reflects the ambient light , like a disco ball			1
the inside of the clam 's lip is packed with tiny spheres of silica , only 340 nanometers in diameter , that are ideal reflectors , particularly of the blue light that penetrates deeper into seawater compared to red light			1
the outside of the lip contains no silica nanospheres , so when the lip is furled , no light is reflected , according to the study , published in the @entity122			0
by repeatedly unfurling and furling the lip , the clam produces a continual rippling light show			1
the non-reflective back of the lip strongly absorbs blue light , so it appears dark and makes the contrast between the sides even more striking			1
a flashy ' dancer ' : it did n't take long for the scientist to confirm that the flashing ( pictured ) was not a form of bioluminescence - a chemical reaction inside animals like plankton that produces light similar to that of a glow stick			0
instead , she found , the edge of the clam 's mantle lip is highly reflective on one side ms @entity42 used high speed video , transmission electron microscopy , x-rays and computer modelling to study the detailed internal structure of the margin of the clam 's lip , with help from other experts at @entity61 , @entity157 and the @entity158			1
she thinks that the ‘ disco clam ’ is alone in using silica nanospheres as flashing reflectors , but the white colour of several insects comes from a layer of silica that reflects white light			1
while ms @entity42 has revealed the mechanics of the mollusc ’s mirrored lips , she does not know why it flashes at all			0
it is unlikely that it uses the light show to attract food as the clams are filter feeders , which means that they eat by straining matter and food particles from the ocean water through an internal filter			0
ms @entity42 also thinks it is unlikely that the display is designed to ward off predators , because there is nothing toxic or dangerous about the light			0
there is a possibility that the disco lights are designed to entice a suitable mate			0
scientists are now studying all 40 of the clams ’ eyes , in order to see whether they can see their own light display .			0

*ctenoides* ales , or ' disco clam ' produces a strobe - light effect using its lips
the sea creature is found in tropical areas of the @entity68 in clusters
when the clam unfurls its lip - typically twice a second - the millimeter - wide ' mirror ' reflects ambient light , like a disco ball
the inside of the clam 's lip is packed with tiny spheres of silica that are ideal reflectors of the blue light that penetrates deeper into seawater
