by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 11:58 est , 17 november 2012 they are 13 little bundles of fluff , all wriggly and bursting with mischief			1
their coats are so soft it is like stroking silk			1
by the time they 've grown up , however , things will have changed dramatically for this landmark litter of @entity13 puppies			1
for soon , they will look just like mum and dad			1
and that means spending the rest of their lives like a pile of raggedy old mop - heads sewn together on legs			2
which , it transpires , is precisely what nature intended			2
landmark : @entity31 's dog @entity29 gave birth to a litter of 13 @entity13 puppies - a record ' @entity36 ' : @entity37 , left , and its siblings all have silky soft fur now , but when they are fully grown their fur will resemble dreadlocks just like this adult @entity13 , right the rare breed was originally used to safeguard sheep in the @entity47 @entity46			1
that coat might bear an uncanny resemblance to the one @entity51 @entity50 famously sported in the 1960s , but up there in the mountains , it just as essential a part of the dog 's wardrobe as a fleece is to a lamb			2
not only does it keep @entity62 warm and dry , it camouflages them against the terrain			2
unique : @entity66 , left , will soon develop the dreadlocks , seen right , that protect @entity69 - originally used to safeguard sheep in the @entity47 @entity46 - against predators like snakes rare : the litter of @entity13 pups are seen at feeding time the unique dreadlocks – far more @entity36 than @entity78 - are matted so tightly they also protect against predators such as snakes , which struggle to penetrate the six - inch long felts			1
okay , so it makes them look a little like living compost heaps , or a character out of the @entity86			2
but the lucky 13 born two months ago to the splendidly named : @entity87 of @entity88 ( that 's her in the black outfit ) are ambassadors for an important new generation of the breed			2
there were estimated to be only around 30 dogs in the @entity95 , and no guarantee that they would endure in this country			1
even with less stringent ' pet passport ' restrictions on bringing dogs into @entity95 , it can still take years to import one			1
record : @entity104 like @entity105 ( front ) and @entity107 love children and are highly protective towards them @entity109 : two of the sleepy puppies stretch and yawn in a basket @entity114 's dozen : @entity31 gives puppy @entity115 a peck - ms @entity118 's dog @entity29 increased the @entity95 population of @entity62 by almost 50 per cent with her litter of 13 there is currently a three to four year waiting list of hopefuls waiting to pay around £ 1,000 a pup , and some have already given up			1
then along came @entity29 's remarkable baker 's dozen – the first @entity95 litter for at least six years			1
it was a record breaking achievement that increased the population by nearly 50 per cent at a stroke			2
' when we looked at the scan of @entity29 we could tell there were five in the womb , maybe six , ' said proud owner mrs @entity118			2
' when she gave birth , the first puppy was breeched			1
after that , they just kept on coming			0
no - one ever expected 13			0
' plans to mate @entity31 's other bitch , @entity143 , were thwarted by medical difficulties , so she now acts as auntie to the pups			0
instead , the 13 were the product of a mating between @entity29 and the magnificent @entity149 , owned by breeder and @entity13 expert @entity151			1
at present they have the run of a large , oak - beamed conservatory at @entity31 's barn - conversion home on the edge of @entity157 , @entity158 , which she shares with the dogs and her surgeon husband @entity161			1
on the prowl : there is a waiting list of between three and four years for a @entity13 like @entity165 @entity166 : homes are gradually being found for the 13 adorable puppies distinctive : @entity170 , who has light brown fur with black patches , plays in the garden when we arrive the puppies are sleeping			1
several seem to find my leather boots irresistible to eat ( although not as attractive as photographer @entity181 's ponytail , which seldom has fewer than two puppies chewing it as she gets down to their level with a camera )			0
trying to line up 13 puppies proves to be as easy as balancing 13 rugby balls end - up on a slope			0
every time you think you 've got one in place , it tumbles off somewhere else			0
the one @entity31 calls @entity196 delights in living up to her name			0
@entity199 , also known as @entity200 ( he has one undescended testicle ) likes to eat cameras			0
@entity105 ( he scratches ) has gone behind a screen for a poo			0
several hours later , as the pups get sleepy , photographing them becomes marginally easier , although it 's still nothing short of chaos			0
meanwhile mum and auntie are doing flying carpet impersonations in a field as they bound off for a walk			0
soon , however , peace will descend once again in the @entity31 household			0
adult : plans to mate ms @entity118 's other bitch , @entity143 , were thwarted by medical difficulties , so the dreadlocked dog now acts as ' auntie ' to the pups @entity223 : impressive adult @entity143 jumps for a ball , displaying its dreadlocks to full effect the puppies are gradually being found homes			0
one will go a trainee minister in @entity232 ; he plans to take the dog with him on pastoral visits to his flock			0
another is heading for a family with an autistic son			0
bergamascos love children and are highly protective towards them			0
a third is earmarked for a woman who loves dogs but is allergic to them			1
she discovered she is completely immune to the @entity13 's unique coat after spending the day with @entity143 , @entity29 and her litter			1
and the next generation of @entity248 ? that 's clearly going to be another chapter in what could , with luck , be a long running shaggy dog story .			0

until this litter there were only 30 @entity13 dogs in @entity95
currently a 3 to 4 year waiting list with each puppy likely to go for £ 1,000
