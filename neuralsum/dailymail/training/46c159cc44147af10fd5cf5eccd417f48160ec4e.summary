it 's surprising that a left wing politician known for his love of newts would draw a picture of a frog ( right ) expert doodler and comic story writer @entity162 , who penned the book , @entity165 : @entity166 ... not , lifted the lid on what our doodles really mean , and you 'll be surprised by what your mindless scribbles reveal			1
for instance , one leggy celebrity , known for marrying a famous @entity112 rocker , included a boat in her doodle the type of boat someone doodles and its relative size and stability determines its interpretation - the water around the boat indicates whether emotions are tranquil or turbulent , says @entity162			2
