@entity1 , 28 , was driving from @entity12 to @entity8 and a driver behind him *started* firing shots while they were on a @entity13 highway
he called 911 as the shooting *continued* across the border to @entity20
told operators that a driving issue - someone breaking suddenly or cutting the other off - prompted the altercation
@entity146 is now on for person driving the dark *colored* pick up truck seen pursuing @entity1 's *car* in highway surveillance footage
police think it may be connected to a similar shooting that took place three days earlier in another part of @entity20
