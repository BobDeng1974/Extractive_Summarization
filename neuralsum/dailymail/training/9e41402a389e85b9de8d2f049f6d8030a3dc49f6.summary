by @entity0 controversy : @entity2 claims its new ' body sculpting ' cream burns fat while its users sleep it sounds too good to be true – a skin cream that helps you to slim while you sleep			1
but that is the claim made by the creators of @entity2 , a new ‘ body sculpting ’ cream said to help burn fat from specific areas – including the waist , inner thighs and chin			1
however , scientists have dismissed the product as a con , accusing its manufacturers of ‘ preying on vulnerable people ’			1
despite their concerns , the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) says it has no power to investigate the claims unless it receives a complaint about the product			1
a 75ml pot of cream and a 50ml tube of serum are being sold together on the @entity35 website at the ‘ launch promotion price ’ of £ 74.95			1
customers are advised to apply the cream in the morning and the serum at night to ‘ lose inches ’			2
according to the @entity35 website , they provide a ‘ gentle non-surgical method to assist the removal of accumulated fat molecule deposits in specific regions of the body ’			1
the publicity for the products states : ‘ in our @entity50 trials , 24 women lost 41 inches in just ten days			2
’ formulated by make - up artist @entity54 and his doctor son @entity55 , the cream and serum are made in a small @entity57 factory			2
the ingredients of the cream include elastin , green tea and the chilli extract capsaicin			2
mr @entity54 said : ‘ i have been working in cosmetics for 50 years , and i ’ve heard so many claims you take them with a pinch of salt			1
so when we tested this and found it worked well , it was a shock			0
‘ we ’ve found that with this cream and serum , you can lose inches in your sleep			0
’ @entity77 , 57 , agreed to test the product despite her biochemist daughter @entity79 telling her it was unlikely to have an effect			0
mrs @entity77 , from @entity82 in @entity83 , said she dropped from size 16 to 14 in ten days			0
she said : ‘ before , i had a roll of fat hanging over my waist			1
’ @entity89 said the results of the 24 - person trial were mirrored in a second trial , run by a gp in @entity94			0
dr @entity95 said he decided to test the product after it helped him lose two inches from his 35in waist			1
he pitted the firm ’s products against @entity100 ’s , which make no ‘ body sculpting ’ claims			1
the volunteers were not told which they were receiving			0
dr @entity95 said : ‘ every woman in the @entity108 lost centimetres from their waists			0
’ those using @entity100 ’s either stayed the same or expanded a little in girth , he added			0
scientists have dismissed the product as a con , accusing its manufacturers of ' preying on vulnerable people ' dr @entity95 insists he has no financial involvement with @entity2			1
however , the firm ’s chief executive @entity119 admitted neither trial was independently checked			0
he said the products were licensed as cosmetics , which was ‘ not so rigorous ’ compared with obtaining a licence as a medicinal @entity126 ’s claims have been criticised by the @entity127 , which gives science - based dietary advice			1
lead dietician @entity129 said : ‘ they should be reported to the @entity23			1
they are preying on vulnerable people			1
not even changing your diet can help you lose fat in a certain area			0
it comes off from everywhere			0
’ she said the trials were so small as to be statistically meaningless , and that no cream in history had been proven to help shift fat			0
an @entity23 spokesman said firms have to prove claims – but only if a complaint is made to the regulator			1
the @entity50 @entity151 state firms ‘ must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective ’			1
in 2012 , the @entity23 ordered cosmetics firm @entity153 to stop advertising an ‘ anti-cellulite gel ’ using the term ‘ body sculpture ’ , because the name ‘ implied the product would have an impact on a user ’s body shape ’			1
@entity162 , pictured with wife @entity163 , claims he lost an inch off his waist after three days effortlessly lose your beer gut ? in days ? lead me to it ! the last time my figure came under public scrutiny – a feature on chest waxing in 1993 – the photographer told me : ‘ i thought you ’d be fatter			1
’ sadly , 20 years on , it was the other way round			0
but i was horrified – when the tape measure round my waist hit 37in			2
people have clearly been lying to me ( and not just @entity180 )			2
now , i am as sceptical as the next middle - aged man when it comes to weight - loss gimmicks			2
if you want to shave inches off your waist , the real answer is simple – do more , eat less			2
i am , if nothing else , the son of a doctor			0
but we ’re all suckers for the easy fix , especially pre-christmas			0
aggressively rubbing a cream into your belly is clearly preferable to sit - ups and a daily lettuce enema			0
i have to be honest : i do n’t believe in this cobblers			0
so , it pains me to say that – after three days – i have lost an inch off my waist			2
mostly , i believe it ’s the shock caused by being measured			0
but , with these results , why not give it a go ?			0
