‘ that was a classic , my wife called me down , i grabbed my camera , and luckily you can see he was n’t in a big hurry , ’ @entity1 said			1
according to @entity1 , the ball is already deflating so the ball wo n’t be stuck on the bucks head for much longer			2
‘ they can be very playful , we ’ve seen them running around trees , and doing all kinds of playful acts			0
he was probably was just playing and pushing that ball around , ’ said @entity1			2
the @entity33 did n’t contact the gaming commission because the ball does n’t impair the deer ’s ability to eat food			0
the @entity33 said that they see deer in their backyard often , and once counted 25 deer at one time			1
deer in the headlights : do you think this buck knows he 's got a basketball stuck to its head ? the ball is already deflating , so it wo n't be stuck in this buck 's antlers for too long according to @entity1 , the deer was n't in too much of a hurry to leave his backyard			1

the ball does not *prevent* the deer from eating food
the @entity1 family once spotted 25 deer in their backyard at once
' he was n’t in a big hurry , ’ @entity1 said
