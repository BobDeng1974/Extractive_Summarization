by @entity0 and @entity1 leaving court : @entity3 leaves @entity4 surrounded by family after the first day of his trial here is the full text of a letter read in court written by @entity3 to the father of one of his alleged victims in march 1997 : ' dear [ the father ] , ' please forgive me for not writing sooner			1
you said in your letter to me that you never wanted to see me or hear from me again , but now [ the alleged victim ] says it 's all right to write to you			1
' since that trip up to @entity20 , i have been in a state of abject self loathing			2
' i fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape , no physical forcing , brutality or beating that took place			1
' when i came to @entity20 , [ the alleged victim ] told me that she had always been terrified of me and went along with everything that i did out of fear of me			1
' i said ' why did you never just say no ? '			2
and [ the alleged victim ] said how could she say no to the great television star @entity3			1
' until she told me that , i had no idea that she was scared of me			0
' she laughs in a bitter way and says i must have known that she has always been scared of me			0
i honestly did n't know			0
' [ the alleged victim ] keeps saying that this has all been going on since she was 13			1
she 's told you that and you were justly horrified , and she keeps reiterating that to me , no matter what i said to the contrary			0
' she says admiring her and telling her she looked lovely in her bathing suit was just the same as physically molesting her			0
nothing took place in a physical way until we had moved to @entity51			1
i think about 1983 or 84 was the first time			1
' i can pinpoint a date was 1986 , because i remember i was in pantomime at @entity55			1
' when i see the misery i have caused [ the alleged victim ] i am sickened by myself			1
you ca n't go back and change things that you have done in this life - i wish to god i could			0
' when i came to @entity20 , spent that time with [ the alleged victim ] and realised the enormity of what i had done to [ the alleged victim ] , and how i had affected her whole life , i begged her for forgiveness and she said ' i forgive you '			2
going home : @entity3 , who denies all of the charges , is pictured climbing into a vehicle following his day at court case : @entity3 , 84 , faces a total of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims between 1968 and 1986 ' whether she really meant it or not , i do n't know			1
i hope she did , but i fear she can never forgive me			0
' i find it hard to like myself in any way , shape or form			0
and as i do these animal programmes , i see the unconditional love that dogs give to their owners and i wish i could start to love myself again			0
' if there is any way that i could atone for what i have done i would willingly do it			0
if there is a way i can start to help [ the alleged victim ] to heal herself , i would willingly do it			2
' with your permission i 'll phone you in a week to talk to you			0
if you hang up , i will understand , but i would like to talk to you to apologise for betraying your trust and for unwittingly so harming your darling [ the alleged victim ]			2
' i know that what i did was wrong but we are , all of us , fallible and oh how i deluded myself			0
' please forgive me , love @entity3			1
' please forgive me for what must have been the most insensitive thing in your eyes - sending the book for @entity102			0
@entity103 knows nothing about all this - at the time - and rather than tell her i signed the book and wrote the platitudes with sinking heart			2
