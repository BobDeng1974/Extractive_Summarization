a @entity1 university professor is adjusting to life in a dumpster as he studies whether people are happier living a simpler lifestyle			1
dr. @entity6 , a @entity7 - educated environmental science professor , has now been housed in the 36 - square - foot container for more than nine months			1
he may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer			1
' the most terrifying night was the second night			0
it was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m. , the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors , a bit of a shock , ' @entity6 told @entity29			1
he added the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster			1
the heat hit @entity35 in the summer and reaches -5c in the winter			0
having now built temperature controls , though , he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project			0
@entity6 posted a picture of him and his girlfriend ( pictured ) with the comment , ' honey , i 'm home			1
this place looks like a dump ' just before he moved in earlier this year @entity6 is moving through different stages			1
@entity50 , which launched on february 4 , 2014 , included living with no amenities , including sourcing water from @entity54 , according to his website			2
@entity56 of the experiment will include a connection to the electrical grid , household appliances , and most amenities found in a modern home			2
@entity63 of the experiment , dubbed ' the @entity65 , ' will launch in the spring of 2015			2
@entity63 aims to combine the best aspects of the first two phases so that all the amenities of modern life will be included , operating with the smallest ecological footprint possible			0

he admits managing the toilet smells can be an issue maintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until mr @entity6 built temperature controls designs may include solar power generation , a composting toilet , a flat screen television , and a passive - solar heated shower ' i 'm not as concerned about the shower , ' he told the @entity90 , ' but getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run			1
' currently , he uses facilities at the university 's gym , but a toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally			2
' you do n't really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed - up 36 square feet , ' he explained			0
after the year of dumpster living is up , @entity6 plans on taking the bin across the @entity103 , educating students about the possibility of following in his ' less is more ' footsteps			1
@entity6 said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at @entity109			1
' i looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight - yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that i was definitely moving into a dumpster , ' he told @entity117			0
so when the lease ran out on his lovely , full - sized , apartment a year later , he posted an announcement on @entity121 , which read : ' starting at 6pm , i will be selling all of my home furnishings , clothes , kitchen appliances , and everything else in the apartment for $ 1 an item			0
' despite , the five - item - per - person maximum , his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase , which was coming with him to the dumpster			0
however , the dumpster was n't ready at that stage , so he moved into his office for the next seven months , secretly sleeping on the floor until he moved in , in feburary			2
' keeping that secret for seven months , especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24 - hour security , much less the students and my colleagues , was interesting in itself , ' he told the website			0
he said : ' we hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing , energy sustainability , science education , and higher quality of life			2
' ultimately , the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing			0
' this is an outlier experiment			0
the students and university , thought they thought the experiment a bit odd , have warmed to the idea , even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to			0

professor @entity6 has been living in a dumpster for past nine months
the *radical* change of housing is part of his sustainable living experiment
