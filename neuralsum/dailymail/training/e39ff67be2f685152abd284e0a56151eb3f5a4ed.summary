by @entity0 @entity1 is among the unlikely inclusions in a new list of record releases worth a small fortune to collectors			1
the @entity8 warbler joins @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 in the list of recent releases , most of them on vinyl , which change hands for hundreds of pounds			1
@entity1 's @entity18 release from just eight years ago - released alongside @entity19 as a limited edition triple vinyl package - weighs in at £ 100			1
worth a ton : @entity1 's @entity18 triple vinyl releases now changes hands for as much as £ 100 , according to a new list of valuable modern records compiled by the experts at @entity29 magazine @entity29 editor @entity30 said : ' it 's common knowledge that some @entity34 records can be worth a packet , and that you should never throw out original rock albums from the 1960s and 70s without finding out whether they are valuable			1
' but few people realise that more recent vinyl albums can also be highly collectable , with fans desperate to obtain copies of albums by the likes of @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity11 as they were only pressed in very limited numbers because most buyers wanted these albums on cd or as downloads			2
' it 's about supply and demand : the print run was low , and demand is now high			0
' the list of 51 modern rarities , dubbed ' @entity59 ' by @entity29 magazine , includes the début @entity61 , @entity11 's first album hopes and fears and @entity64 by @entity10 , also each valued at £ 100 on vinyl			1
@entity67 's @entity66 is another which the list 's creator @entity68 - who edits the @entity70 - puts at £ 100			2
oddly enough , almost mint copies of @entity73 , her lp from more than two decades earlier , can be had for as little as £ 8			2
pretty pricey : @entity9 's debut album showbiz and @entity64 by @entity10 also shift for around the £ 100 mark music collectibles lists tend to be dominated by classic early releases or obscure cult acts , but @entity29 's latest list focuses solely on rare releases out since 2000			1
and it shows that popularity and chart success are no deterrent to the hardcore music collector - it is usually the scarcity of limited edition versions which has added to their value			0
a box set by @entity92 called @entity92 21 , drawing together each of their album releases , now attracts a price of £ 200 on vinyl			1
their @entity100 rivals @entity98 attract £ 300 for the 2009 collection of each of their albums , according to the list to be published in the @entity29 's may edition			1
among the more esoteric entries is the incidental music from children 's show @entity109 , with the 26 copies which came in a knitted sleeve going for around £ 125			0
and a 12in single by @entity114 called @entity115 - said to have been the world 's first liquid - filled record - is listed at £ 300			0
the most expensive item on the list is @entity122 's @entity121 which came out in 2012 and was limited to just 100 copies on four cd - r discs			1
they were pressed to extend the copyright of the material recorded in 1962 and are estimated to be worth £ 600			0
the 50th @entity128 ( @entity129 , 2012 , son , no cat no ) £ 600 while most releases covered in this list are vinyl , this @entity129 set can not be ignored			1
it was ' released ' in a limited edition of 100 copies to ensure that @entity138 could renew its copyright of @entity122 material – including six versions of @entity142 – that was originally recorded in 1962			1
in other words , they stopped it falling into the public domain			0
@entity147 ( white vinyl box set , @entity149 , 2008 , @entity150 512119 - 1 ) £ 500 @entity147 was the ninth studio album by @entity151			1
death magnetic is the ninth studio album by @entity151 , released in 2008 through @entity150 @entity154 ( @entity156 expanded edition , 2008 , @entity159 / @entity158 / @entity157 8122799489 ) £ 500 the song remains the @entity161 is the soundtrack live album of the concert film of the same name by @entity164			0
the album was originally released in october 1976 , before being remastered and re-issued in 2007			0
@entity115 ( 12 ” 2012 third man tmr 137 ) £ 300 the only shop selling this beauty on @entity169 in 2012 was @entity114 ’s @entity171 outlet in @entity172 , @entity173			0
the fuss is because this 12in is the world ’s first liquid - filled record			0
it ’s estimated that only 400 were made			0
some have leaked ! @entity181 ( 2009 , big brother rkidbox 58 ) £ 300 what you get in this box set is every album the @entity188 brothers recorded			1
the box was limited to 1,500 numbered copies and the majority have probably never been removed from their shrink - wrap			2
@entity194 ( lp +7 ” , 2011 , @entity195 139 ) £ 250 in just a few short years , @entity196 went from nowhere to supporting @entity197 on their 2013 world tour			0
the price for pressings on purple vinyl – with no 7 ” – is £ 100 , and you can expect to pay around £ 20 for dark - as - @entity204 black wax			2
the @entity205 ( lp , 2011 , @entity156 001 ) £ 200 there are just 29 vinyl copies of the @entity209 soundtrack to this classic @entity211 horror film in existence , pressed up a few years ago by @entity213			2
the lp has an embossed logo on the cover and hand - stamped artwork plus an insert explaining its origins			0
@entity219 ( box set , 2010 , @entity195 124 ) £ 200 this debut album by a @entity223 doom band has been hailed as a classic and put them on the map worldwide , with recent follow - up , @entity228 ( 2013 ) , cementing their reputation			1
there was a mind - boggling number of limited - edition coloured vinyl variants of @entity235 – as well as a gamut of re-pressings to sate demand			0
but this is the mother - collectable black vinyl edition in a box that contains a patch and a massive @entity244 - sized poster			2
@entity92 21 ( @entity246 , 2012 , @entity247 1 ) £ 200 this box set , released to mark @entity92 's 21st anniversary , features the band 's seven studio albums on heavyweight vinyl , each of the @entity254 repackaged as a double album except for @entity256 , a single album			1
@entity258 ( lp , 2005 , @entity259 191 p ) £ 150 @entity258 is the fifth album by @entity261 alternative rock band @entity260 , released on june 7 , 2005 , on @entity262			0
