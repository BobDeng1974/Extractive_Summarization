determined not to let the @entity3 court 's judgement over whether she was responsible for the murder of @entity5 keep her in hiding , @entity0 strolls hand - in - hand with her fiancé			1
the 27 - year - old was joined by musician @entity9 and her mother , @entity10 , as they took a brief walk outside her family home in @entity14 , @entity15 , on thursday evening			1
@entity16 and @entity9 , 27 , clasped their hands together but both appeared nervous and sported serious expressions , with neither smiling , as they took advantage of the spring evening			2
the @entity3 court is expected to decide whether or not @entity16 is guilty of murdering @entity5 today tension is in the air as @entity0 and @entity9 take a brief stroll before returning inside home of @entity0 's mom the couple see her mom off as she takes her dogs for a walk			1
@entity0 's mom @entity10 walks her dogs			1
@entity16 ’s family are rallying around her and trying to help her lead as normal a life as possible in the run up to the final decision by the @entity40 - @entity3 's highest court - in @entity41 on friday			1
shortly before their walk , @entity9 was seen carrying a bag of ice and two bags of shopping into the house , possibly supplies for a long and agonizing night waiting for the verdict			1
earlier on thursday , @entity0 – who in 2013 penned memoir waiting to be heard about the murder case and her four years in jail - was spotted with her fiance writing on a notepad in the backyard			1
the @entity3 court is set to decide if it will uphold a 2013 ruling declaring @entity16 and her former boyfriend , @entity58 , guilty of the 2007 killing of the @entity62 exchange student			1
the decision was due on wednesday but has been delayed			0
and today , @entity58 's lawyer launched a last - ditch attempt to save his own skin and blow a hole in @entity69 's defense			2
the former lover was compared to a ' @entity71 ' caught up in events beyond his understanding			0
@entity16 and @entity58 had originally been convicted in 2009 , but were acquitted in 2011 , allowing @entity16 to fly back to her hometown in the @entity69 , although the verdict was then reversed in 2013			2
there are a number of possible outcomes to the trial : either both @entity16 and @entity58 will be found guilty , they will both be declared not guilty , one will be convicted but not the other , or the whole thing could go back for another round of appeal			2
even if the trial does end in a conviction , former judge @entity86 – who has long championed @entity16 ’s cause and become close to her family , even being invited to her wedding - says he feels there is little chance of her being extradited to @entity3 for the 28 and a half year sentence she has been handed if convicted			2
earlier in the day , sitting in the afternoon sun , @entity0 calmly wrote in her journal in mom 's backyard if declared guilty , the decision to extradite @entity0 back to @entity3 ultimately rests in the hand of president @entity104 and secretary of state kerry speaking exclusively to @entity107 , he said : ‘ i imagine it ’s been very tense for [ the @entity16 family ]			1
i ’m optimistic the case will be dismissed and they ’ll be acquitted			0
‘ well respected scientists are coming in and debunking the dna evidence against them and public opinion [ in @entity3 ] has gone from 90 % against to around 80 % for her			2
‘ @entity58 was in court wednesday which is good			0
they never really aimed at @entity58 , it ’s always been @entity0 , @entity0 , @entity0			0
very sexist , by the way , very anti-american			0
‘ but this has been a witch - hunt , as if it was @entity121 , @entity122 , 1691			0
no different except that it goes global			0
‘ and it titillates a great percentage of people , they find is fascinating , this idea of a sex orgy gone wrong and two pretty girls that was originally put forward by the prosecution			0
’ referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to @entity134 of @entity3 cleric @entity135 by the @entity136 and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an @entity3 court of @entity141 operative @entity140 for that crime , he added : ‘ there ’s good reasons to dislike the @entity69 , we ’ve done a lot of bad things around the world , i can agree with a lot of their criticisms			1
ms @entity152 , a 21 - year - old student from @entity153 , @entity154 , was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in @entity157 in 2007			0
the house in @entity157 where @entity62 student @entity5 was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 @entity58 is pictured leaving @entity41 's @entity160 on wednesday as @entity3 's top judges delayed a ruling on whether to uphold his and @entity0 's conviction for the murder of student @entity5 @entity5 is serving a 16 - year sentence for his involvement in @entity152 's death after a separate trial ‘ our @entity136 kidnapped an @entity173 cleric , an @entity3 citizen , and they ca n’t get their minister of justice to ask the @entity69 for an extradition , they ca n’t get it done , so they ’re frustrated			1
‘ [ but in this case ] @entity58 is collateral damage			0
if we confirm their convictions , we send an innocent @entity3 man – and the people probably wo n’t like that – to prison , and the [ @entity3 ] minister of justice probably wo n’t even ask for extradition , but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the @entity69 on a false claim ? ‘ the kidnapping of an @entity3 citizen – that ’s a legitimate claim and they still do n’t want to take on the @entity69			0
so are they going to take on the @entity69 on a @entity193 claim ? ‘ no. it ’s a fraud , and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along			0
' if @entity16 is declared guilty , the decision to extradite her back to @entity3 ultimately rests in the hand of president @entity104 and secretary of state kerry .			1

hours before her fate is to be be decided by @entity3 's highest court , @entity0 and her fiancé take a walk outside her mother 's home
earlier in the day @entity0 was seen writing in a journal in her mom 's backyard in @entity14
her rock musician fiancé @entity9 has been by her side
@entity217 looked *distraught* as she walked her two dogs
the @entity3 court will deliver its decision to uphold guilty verdict in the murder of @entity5 today
if declared guilty , the decision to extradite @entity0 back to @entity3 ultimately rests in the hands of president @entity104 and secretary of state kerry
