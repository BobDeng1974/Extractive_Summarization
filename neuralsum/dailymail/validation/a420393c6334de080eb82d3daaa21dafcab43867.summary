on its way : a map shows the snowfall expected this week , with parts of @entity42 and @entity41 expected to fair the worst - around five inches - while @entity43 will just get an inch or two cold mix : the storm will bring wet snow to @entity43 as it moves northeast throughout the weekend @entity43 residents will be pleased to hear they will not be getting the worst snowfall ; instead central @entity41 , northern @entity95 and the outskirts of @entity42 will see the most - as many as five inches			1
