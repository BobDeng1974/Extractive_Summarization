it is said there is no such thing as being over-prepared , and this is clearly a motto the @entity4 government has taken to heart as it publishes a 98 - page guide on how to survive an invasion			2
the small @entity9 state has released the manual , entitled how to act in @entity11 , so its three million citizens will know exactly what to do should war come to their home soil			0
its handy hints include keeping calm , using @entity19 to organise resistance and - if all else fails - simply doing your job a little worse than you did before			1
@entity4 's government has released a manual entitled how to act in @entity26 the guide advises : ' keep a sound mind , do n't panic and do n't lose clear thinking			2
' gunshots just outside your window are not the end of the world			0
' the manual , which the @entity36 has sent to the country 's libraries and is planning to distribute at army events , says @entity4 should resist foreign occupation with demonstrations and strikes , ' or at least doing your job worse than usual '			1
in the event of invasion , the manual says @entity4 should organise themselves through @entity46 and @entity19 and attempt cyber attacks against the enemy			1
it also suggests the best exit routes from the country , should residents want to flee , as well as advising people to keep their car tanks full			0
indeed , the government is so worried about a possible invasion , it is also considering requiring all future buildings to incorporate a bomb shelter on the premises			2
but while the idea of a war in @entity4 may seem somewhat unlikely to an outside observer , government ministers have explained the move was sparked by recent tensions between their far larger neighbour @entity68 and the @entity69			1
the guide was compiled in reaction to @entity68 's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states less than 500 miles separate @entity74 from its border , and it is increasingly worried about @entity68 , not least because of a military drill in the @entity68 enclave of @entity79 last month that featured 9,000 soldiers and more than 55 naval vessels			0
' the examples of @entity84 and @entity69 , which both lost a part of their territory , show us that we can not rule out a similar kind of situation here , and that we should be ready , ' defence minister @entity82 explained			0
' when @entity68 started its aggression in @entity69 , here in @entity4 our citizens understood that our neighbor is not friendly , ' already , the country - which spent most of the last century under the control of the @entity97 , but clearly plans on being its own boss in this one - has increased recruitment for both its army and paramilitary reserve force			1
@entity68 annexed the @entity104 peninsula from @entity69 last year , and @entity106 governments say they have overwhelming evidence that it is supplying troops and weaponry to @entity111 separatists who have seized parts of eastern @entity69 , an accusation that @entity74 denies .			0

recent aggression between @entity68 and the @entity69 prompted new guide
advises citizens to use @entity19 and @entity46 to organise resistance
*recommends* *plotting* cyber attacks or ' doing your job worse than usual '
@entity4 has also been increasing the size of its army and reserve forces
ministers now considering requiring future buildings to have bomb shelters
