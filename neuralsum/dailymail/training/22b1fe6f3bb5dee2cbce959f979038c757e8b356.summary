the search for three objects that may be debris from missing @entity3 will be long , complicated and fraught by the vast expanse of the @entity6 target area			1
that 's the expert view of @entity8 , the retired @entity9 astronaut who spent months at the @entity10 monitoring the ocean from above , adding that variables in weather , wind and light may conspire against search teams in a ' very complex ' mission			1
an exhaustive operation led by @entity20 authorities commenced thursday to sweep a remote patch in the southern @entity6 after two large objects - one estimates to be 24 metres ( 78ft ) long - were spotted by an @entity24 commercial satellite			2
two objects spotted by an @entity24 satellite sparked an exhaustive sweep of the southern @entity6 thursday , as @entity20 authorities describe the images as the ' best lead yet ' in the search for missing @entity3 a third object has been spotted via @entity33 satellite : this image provided by @entity33 's @entity35 shows a floating object seen in the @entity6 search zone view from above : commander @entity8 says the vastness of the @entity6 alone , let alone the many variables that could affect the search , will make the operation very complex a third object was spotted by @entity33 satellite , it was announced saturday , as the search entered its fourth day some 2,500 kilometres of the coast of @entity46			1
but despite the optimism of the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , the agency tasked with co-ordinating the search , and @entity20 prime minister @entity51 , commander @entity8 this week warned the likelihood of locating the objects remained extremely slim			1
commander @entity8 stressed the vastness of the search area and the ongoing challenge posed by unpredictable weather conditions , meant the southern search operation would be extremely difficult			1
' the immensity of the sea is hard to express , ' he told @entity62			2
' even going as fast as the space station goes , at 5 miles a second , it 's such a huge , untracked area			2
vast , immense , untracked , huge : the @entity6 - even as seen from space - is almost too expansive to comprehend , according to commander @entity8 commander @entity8 's time at the @entity10 gave him a unique perspective on ocean monitoring : ' if someone looks away or catches a wave the wrong way ... trying to repeat a grid pattern to make sure they 've truly exhausted everywhere they 've looked - it 's a really complex thing to do ' ' i 've been in the bottom of the space station with the biggest lens that we have , staring at the sea and taking pictures of the surface , and the vagaries of weather and wind and reflection off the water - even with those @entity89 and following airplanes searching the area - it 's not nearly as simple as you 'd like it to be			1
' if someone looks away or catches a wave the wrong way ... trying to repeat a grid pattern to make sure they 've truly exhausted everywhere they 've looked - it 's a really complex thing to do			0
' the objects were spotted by the @entity24 satellite imaging firm @entity100 , using a 2800 - kilogram unit called the @entity102			0
it 's capable of taking images every 1.1 days , @entity106 media reports , and can capture pictures at a resolution of 50 centimetres			0
the objects were spotted by the @entity24 satellite imaging firm @entity100 , using a 2800 - kilogram unit called the @entity102 the southern @entity6 search zone , where an expanding fleet of aircraft are searching for missing @entity3 , is a huge area complicated by many variables commander @entity8 acknowledged that while the lead was ' very promising ' , it may be a long shot to track the objects , which authorities stress may have already sunk well below the surface in a very deep stretch of the @entity6			1
' it 's a very promising lead but not conclusive - it could be something that was swept off a ship , ' he told @entity125			0
' i think in fact , from satellites , is going to be our first bet and finding a debris field			0
' it may very well be the way we find the wreckage of this plane , assuming that 's what happened to it			0
' helping to explain how a plane the size of the @entity141 777 - 200 could simply disappear , even with all the advanced technology available in 2014 , commander @entity8 told @entity143 he was n't shocked that it still has n't been found			2
' just tracking one , thing aluminium tube ( the plane ) in a place that is n't heavily radar covered is really hard , virtually impossible , ' he said			0
' it is not a surprise to me at all how easy it is to make something that big disappear			0

@entity3 search ' very complex ' in a huge expanse of the @entity6 off the coast of @entity46
retired astronaut @entity8 says the immensity of the area ' hard to express '
commander @entity8 spent months being able to observe the ocean from @entity10
