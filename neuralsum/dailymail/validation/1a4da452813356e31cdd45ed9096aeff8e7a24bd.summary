when i arrived at eco-chic resort @entity1 for @entity3 , i was expecting just that – a week full of hard - core beach workouts to tone up my body for spring			1
i was also escaping @entity7 ’s brutal winter and after a quick three - and - a - half hour flight from @entity10 to @entity11 , bootcamp base is just a 90 minute drive to @entity14 ’s bohemian town of @entity15 - a decidedly more exotic getaway than @entity17 for seasonally depressed @entity7			1
what i was n't expecting at @entity3 was the spiritual journey that accompanied it and how the group of 18 women who had also traveled from @entity24 ’s @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity26 would be the ingredients to such a unique experience			1
@entity3 blast : bootcampers kick off the day with a 7am beach walk in @entity15 , @entity14 , followed by a blast of exercises before heading into yoga vigorous vinyasa : @entity36 practices her bridge pose in one of @entity3 's yoga studios in the class before the 9:30am breakfast much like a summer camp , but for professional women mainly in their thirties and forties , we all sat down for opening circle on the first night to introduce ourselves and reveal what brought us here			1
the fitness instructors – predominantly @entity24 who work seasonally in @entity14 or moved down permanently for the lifestyle – told us that every group each week is here for a reason			1
we had all come from different backgrounds , with our different reasons for choosing @entity3			1
some were mothers who needed a week to themselves , some were marathon runners who wanted a scheduled workout vacation and others needed a kick - start on their fitness regime before summer			1
whatever the intention for signing up , we all ended up being here this same week , and the first uncanny coincidence of the group was realized when the two complete strangers from @entity26 found out they live on the exact same street , just two houses apart			0
@entity66 : @entity36 and the bootcampers pictured learning choreography for dance class rooftop yoga : the group hit the rooftop studio for an ocean view while performing chair pose most of the women were n't looking for a bonding experience when they signed up for bootcamp , but inevitably tight friendships soon formed			1
after a night of introductions and our first yoga class , it was time to hit the sack and drift into a deep sleep while listening to the @entity87 waves lapping right outside our bungalows			2
the fitness aspect of bootcamp kicked off straight away each morning , with one hour sunrise beach walks at 7am followed by a ‘ bikini blast ’ on the white sands to feel the burn in our arms , gluts and abs. morning sessions are encouraged to be performed on an empty stomach and after the ‘ bikini beach blast ’ it is straight into either @entity104 or @entity105 before breakfast			1
meditation : the studio was filled with candles and flower petals for an afternoon of yoga and meditation by the time 9.30am rolls around and we ’ve already worked out for over two hours on empty , all i can think about is running to the restaurant for a well - earned feast			2
food prepared by the resort is all low sugar and low carb and the naturally delicious meals are all accompanied by detoxifying juices			0
despite not seeing bread for the entire week , each meal leaves me feeling satisfied and ready to take on the next physical challenge			0
breakfast is followed by a one hour circuit class taken by a @entity129 - lookalike , which makes the push - ups and sit - ups a little more bearable , and then bootcampers are allowed a five hour break before afternoon classes resume			2
7am : beach walk ending with a ' bikini blast ' workout for arms , gluts and abs 8.30am : power pilates or @entity105 9:30am : breakfast 10:30am : circuit class or bike tour to the @entity145 and @entity146 for snorkeling 12:30 : lunch free time for spa services and relaxation 4:30pm : @entity150 or @entity151 5:30pm : restorative rooftop yoga 7:30pm : dinner 8:30pm : salsa breakfast : fresh fruit , @entity14 eggs ( scambled / poached / hard boiled ) , home - made granola and natural yoghurt served with detoxifying juices lunch : @entity164 gazpacho , home - made salad with mixed greens , cabbage and carrots , accompanied with either grilled fish or chicken and house - dressing made of @entity173 honey , balsamic , olive oil and sesame afternoon snack : smoothie of your choice dinner : puree of local squash and either fresh fish or chicken on a bed of quinoa , shredded broccoli , spinach and almonds relaxing in paradise : @entity3 's @entity87 beach ( pictured ) at the resort is the perfect place to rest in - between fitness and yoga classes @entity14 ’s @entity197 is home to some of the most beautiful beaches on earth so it ’s not hard for every afternoon in @entity15 to feel like you ’re in paradise			1
a 20 minute bicycle ride along the dusty beach road will take you to the @entity145 , which were erected 700 years ago on the @entity173 coast to protect the city			0
another short drive from the ruins will take you to @entity15 ’s @entity146 , which is one of the most popular diving and snorkeling areas in the @entity197			2
the intricate cave system consists of stalagmites and stalactites that will have you weaving between each formation while discovering the underwater mazes			0
diving in : @entity36 seen diving in @entity15 's @entity146 cave system day tours : afternoon breaks from bootcamp can be filled by cycling to the @entity145 , sitting on the coastline of @entity197 ( pictured ) the underground rivers and caves are over 6,500 years old and you ’ll definitely burn a few calories while swimming through the system			1
and while myself and my fellow bootcampers are n’t exploring the bio-diversity and history of @entity15 , we are working around our massage schedules back at the resort			2
part of the spirituality within the program comes from the healing powers of those who work in the spa			0
the therapeutic treatments are so rejuvenating that it ’s no wonder @entity246 came here after her divorce from @entity248 in 2013			1
healing her heart : @entity246 ( pictured ) went to @entity3 in @entity14 in 2013 after her divorce from @entity248 before @entity251 : @entity36 spreads the anti-aging @entity173 clay over her as one of the treatments a huge list of spa services offer everything from a typical full body massage or reflexology , to alternative treatments such as an appointment with the heart whisperer – an old @entity173 healer who whispers in your ear while detoxifying your body and soul			1
and then there is the @entity270 – a sweat lodge which is not only a spiritual journey that originated from the @entity274 people of @entity14 but is also a detoxifying ‘ rebirth ’ which will leave sweat dripping from every pour of your body			2
each treatment is influenced by a meditative angle and even the @entity173 clay full - body mask used for anti-aging was accompanied by a visualization technique			0
the @entity285 used @entity173 clay to maintain their youthful skin centuries before @entity251 was invented , so i generously lather the substance from my head to my toes			0
the 18 women in my group all join in and once we ’re unrecognizable in our clay body - masks we assemble down at the ocean ’s edge where one of our yoga instructors carries out a meditation exercise on us			2
as the sun dries the clay and it slowly begins to crack , it ’s time to run into the @entity304 and wash away the mud … and all our negative thoughts			0
it is easy to become distracted in this avant - garde beach town perched on the @entity309 , which is why the bootcamp schedule helps keep me on track			0
ready to cleanse : @entity36 and her fellow @entity313 pose after their full body @entity173 clay mask before washing it off in the @entity304 classes resume at 4.30pm , which rotate daily between kickboxing , @entity321 dance classes , power abs or a tone and sculpt class			1
@entity3 's price range starts from $ 2,250 for a triple room to $ 3,950 for a private deluxe beachfront room			2
@entity328 has daily direct flights from @entity7 's @entity10 to @entity11 and return flights start from $ 600			0
7:10am : @entity10 to @entity11 5:46pm : @entity11 to @entity10 shuttles drive from @entity332 to @entity333 in @entity15 for @entity3 in 90 minutes buses also leave regularly from @entity332 to @entity15 , via @entity335 in terms of the quality of the fitness classes , they are on par with my local gym in @entity343 , but the ocean views from open - walled and rooftop studios are unbeatable			1
the programme is also a la carte so bootcampers can choose to participate in every activity on the day ’s menu or only attend the ones of interest			0
i often miss the circuit class straight after breakfast and opt to swim in the ocean or cycle to the local boutiques instead and never feel any pressure to have my butt kicked by the blonde heartthrob taking the session			0
i also never get the feeling that this week is about extreme weight loss and in fact neither i , nor any of the women that i ask feel they had lost any substantial weight by the end of the week			0
it is instead about cleansing the mind , body and soul , without an obsession with bathroom scales			0
@entity375 yoga : @entity3 days would end with @entity377 classes during sunset on the rooftop despite not losing weight , i definitely feel a deep awareness of having a healthy body , mind and an overall rejuvenated sense of self			1
my favorite class of each day is always restorative yoga on the rooftop studio during sunset between 5.30 and 6.30pm			0
i still consider myself a beginner at yoga and only started practicing regularly over the past six months but one thing i enjoy about every class is learning to be present in the moment and finding gratitude for something in my life			0
as i watch the sunset over @entity15 during my downward dog , the only thought going through my mind is to be grateful for this very moment in paradise .			2
