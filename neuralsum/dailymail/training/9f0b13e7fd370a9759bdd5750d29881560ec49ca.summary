they say a good book is timeless			0
but you 'll have to rush to get the most out of these incredible tomes			0
carved out of ice , the 250 - pound blocks tell stories of the earth using leaves , seeds and dirt to raise awareness about the rapidly melting glaciers and our need to save them			1
she then laces them with seeds - then leaves them on the bank side to melt and repopulate the land			2
the project , entitled @entity44 / @entity43 , has been rolled out across @entity45 using fauna from each local region			1
project : @entity32 ( right ) spends days carving each 250lb block , which is then released into the water unique : each tome in communities across @entity45 is unique as it uses fauna from the local river banks crystallized : this book , entitled @entity57 , uses @entity58 from @entity59 , @entity60 mountainous : @entity61 uses @entity62 from @entity63 in @entity64 a @entity66 story : red maple was used to design this sculpture for children near @entity70 and it will be used in school curricula to teach schoolchildren about biodiversity			1
ms @entity75 explains : ' @entity76 emphasises the necessity of communal effort , artistic insight , and scientific knowledge to deal with the complex issues of climate disruption and watershed restoration by releasing seed - laden ephemeral ice sculptures into rivers			0
' ' when an ecosystem is restored and the plants grow along the riverbanks , they help sequester carbon , mitigate floods and drought			0
keen readers : these students waded through the water in @entity70 to read the @entity97 flower book nature at its finest : the summer project sees the books glisten in golden light before drifting into the water ' they pollinate other plants , disperse seeds , hold the banks in place ( slowing erosion ) , create soil regeneration and preservation , act as filters for pollutants and debris , supply leaf - litter ( for food and habitat ) , promote aesthetic pleasure , and provide shelter / shade for riverside organisms including humans			1
' @entity75 works with stream ecologists , biologists , and botanists to ascertain the best seeds for each specific riparian zone .			2

ecological artist @entity32 carves books out of frozen river water
she laces them with seeds to create works of art then leaves them to melt
the project , started in @entity20 , promotes need to stop glaciers melting
it has been rolled out across @entity45 , communities use local fauna
