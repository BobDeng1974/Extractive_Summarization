if @entity2 ’s @entity1 success on thursday is to be @entity4 ’s last @entity3 win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory			1
but , typically , at least for the time being , it will be confined to the recesses of the @entity4 memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy - tale end to his @entity3 career on friday afternoon			1
over breakfast , he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction , you do n’t win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his @entity23 mount , @entity24 , begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm			1
one thing is certain , the mood will be better at the @entity4 table than it was 24 hours earlier			2
@entity4 rides @entity2 to victory in thursday ’s @entity1 for his 31st @entity3 win @entity4 celebrates with the trophy after his first @entity3 win of 2015 with his @entity34 by his side @entity36 admitted the atmosphere had been ‘ melancholy ’ after two fruitless days amid , no doubt , a creeping fear that things were not going her husband ’s way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages			1
@entity4 's wife @entity36 admitted a ‘ melancholy ’ had come over @entity46 after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16 - 1 shot all that changed when 16 - 1 shot @entity2 , not even the first string of his trainer @entity51 in the @entity1 but transformed by the fitting of a visor , galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of @entity57			1
even the crowd seemed stunned at first			0
the roar took time to grow but by the time @entity4 had returned to the winners ’ enclosure , they were raising three cheers			2
after being joined on the winner ’s podium by @entity36 , his father @entity64 and boss @entity65 , @entity4 said : ‘ @entity3 is a very special place			1
it is where every jockey wants to win and i am no different			0
these are the days i am going to miss that ’s for sure			0
‘ i had lots of rides coming into the week but did not have any real bankers			0
‘ you have to keep going race after race and hope one of them wins			0
that is how my life has normally been , so there is no point changing this week			0
‘ i was all right			0
you can try your best to make them go faster but you need the horse — and this horse is very well			0
‘ i was a bit worried he would not have the stamina to see it out but he got a lot of the others in trouble trying to keep up with him			0
’ @entity65 , his ally for a decade , looked as if he derived just as much satisfaction at being able to supply one last winner for his retained jockey as he does landing one of his legendary punts			2
he said : ‘ it is great to have a man like @entity46 on your side			0
i am just so happy he has had a winner at his last @entity3 and that we provided it for him makes it even better			0
@entity65 , @entity46 's ally for a decade , was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win @entity65 said : ' i am so happy he has had a winner at his last festival ... that we provided it for him makes it better ' ‘ i remember years ago @entity116 rang me and said ‘ ‘ have you seen this young lad ride ? he should be handicapped , not the horses ’ ’			1
‘ i respect @entity46 and love everything he does on and off the racecourse			0
’ @entity4 will wear the green and gold @entity65 colours on @entity125 - trained @entity24 , as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the @entity3 — @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 in the concluding @entity131 which carries his own name			1
@entity65 has not ruled out the dream @entity23 ending he said : ‘ @entity24 has a chance in a very open race			1
i was hoping he might be good enough			0
‘ he had a few problems earlier in the season but nothing serious			0
he improved from the run in the @entity141 at @entity142 and has a good 10 - 1 chance of winning in an open @entity23			1
’ there are definitely plenty of dangers — about 17 of them — as few can be ruled out			0
defending champion @entity148 aims to win at his third consecutive @entity3 and provide his trainer , @entity149 , with a first win under rules since the week after last year ’s @entity23			2
a win for last year ’s fourth and the form horse of the race , favourite @entity155 , would also put his trainer @entity156 , who additionally saddles @entity157 , level with the late @entity159 as a record five - time race winner			2
@entity4 stands with @entity24 after their win in the @entity163 at @entity164 on february 8			1
he 'll be riding the same mount in the @entity23 on friday shortly after 3.20pm but his lack of course form is a worry and , the chaotic and close nature of last year ’s finish means it is surely better to look at one of the younger first time runners ; horses like @entity174 ’s @entity173 , @entity176 ’s @entity175 and @entity178 ’s @entity177 , who at one point looked like being @entity4 ’s mount			1
also in that category is the @entity184 - trained @entity183 , behind whom there is growing confidence , and @entity24			2
but if @entity65 acknowledged he was unsure if his horse could supply the win everyone craves , he reckons he has found a way to replace his soon - to - retire jockey			1
‘ we ’ve had him cloned , ’ he joked			2
@entity4 kisses the @entity23 after his win on @entity193 in 2012 1995 beech road ( @entity194 ) 100 - 1 7th 1996 @entity195 ( @entity196 ) 16 - 1 4th 1997 @entity197 ( @entity198 ) 20 - 1 1st 1998 @entity199 ( @entity200 ) 10 - 1 pulled up 1999 @entity201 ( @entity200 ) 14 - 1 pulled up 2000 @entity202 ( @entity200 ) ( 13 - 2 ) fell 2001 no race ( @entity205 ) 2002 @entity206 ( @entity200 ) 10 - 1 pulled up 2003 you ’re @entity208 ( @entity200 ) 50 - 1 9th 2004 @entity209 ( @entity200 ) 15 - 2 7th 2005 @entity209 ( @entity200 ) 16 - 1 9th 2006 @entity210 ( @entity211 ) 16 - 1 pulled up 2007 exotic dancer ( @entity211 ) 9 - 2 2nd 2008 @entity212 ( @entity211 ) 17 - 2 5th 2009 exotic dancer ( @entity211 ) 8 - 1 3rd 2010 @entity213 ( @entity214 ) 4 - 1 2nd 2011 @entity215 ( @entity216 ) 9 - 1 pulled up 2012 @entity217 ( @entity211 ) 8 - 1 1st 2013 @entity218 ( @entity216 ) 4 - 1 2nd 2014 @entity219 ( @entity220 ) 10 - 1 10th			1
