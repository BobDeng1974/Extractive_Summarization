by @entity0 billions of jellyfish are appearing around our coastlines following weeks of warm weather			2
huge billowing blooms , each containing thousands of jellyfish , have suddenly appeared in our waters as the animals respond to high sea temperatures			2

moon jellyfish are not dangerous to humans , only giving a mild sting mr @entity13 , 43 , said : ‘ i ’ve lived here all my life and i have never seen anything like it			1
‘ there were just thousands of them , floating there in huge masses			0
i was in the canoe with my two sons @entity34 , who is ten , and @entity35 , who is eight , and there they were , all these jellyfish			2
‘ it was quite a sight			0
’ @entity39 , which are known by conservationists as a barometer of the seas , are remarkably sensitive to changes in temperature , pollution and numbers of predators and food sources			0
statistics released yesterday by the @entity50 show that we have had a remarkably warm june , which is on track to be the sixth warmest since records began in 1910			0
the month so far has seen average temperatures of @entity57 ( @entity58 ) - @entity59 above average			0

i was in the canoe with my two sons @entity34 , who is ten , and @entity35 , who is eight , and there they were , all these jellyfish , ' said mr @entity13 the common blue jellyfish , which has a strong sting , is worth steering clear of a @entity50 spokesman said : ‘ this continues a run of seven months where the @entity74 mean temperature was warmer than average , with all the months from december through to april each being at least 1c warmer than the long - term average			2
’ the warm and dry weather looks set to go out with a very wet weekend , with downpours forecasted for today before a drier day tomorrow			0
the @entity50 last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain , with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours today			0

@entity91 , of the @entity92 , said : ' it has been a good year for jellyfish sightings so far ' it also can only cause mild discomfort to humans , but the common blue jellyfish which has a stronger sting , is worth steering clear of			1

‘ @entity102 seem to magically appear in large numbers , when daylight lengthens and sea temperature rises , but this is quite normal			1
‘ we have seen unusually high numbers of another type of jellyfish - the barrel – a large oceanic species that can grow to well over a metre long			1
another species which has been seen in large numbers in recent weeks is the massive barrel jellyfish , a spectacular large species which can grow up to four feet long and weigh three stone ( 20kg )			1
the one above was spotted by the @entity115 in @entity16 ‘ both species are largely harmless , but we always advise bathers to avoid touching them , as some jellyfish do possess a powerful sting			1
’ @entity120 , of @entity121 , said : ‘ the warm weather we have had over the last few weeks has definitely led to an increase in the number of jellyfish			2
‘ we have seen more of these large barrel jellies than at any time since 2002 and there have been thousands of moon jellies - in some places the sea is just thick with them			2
‘ @entity39 go through a boom and bust cycle due to the way they reproduce			0
you either get thousands at a time , or you get none - there is n’t an in - between state			0
’ dr @entity141 , of the @entity142 in @entity143 , said huge blooms of moon jellyfish are usually seen when tides or winds blow thousands of the animals into a bay or cove			1
she added : ‘ warmer weather tends to cause a boom of plankton in the water , and that is what jellyfish eat			0
but it is a complex picture , to do with their reproduction cycles as well as the warm weather			0
