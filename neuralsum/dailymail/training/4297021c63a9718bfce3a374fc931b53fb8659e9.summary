a formula 1 race car once dubbed ' the most radical ever ' has gone on sale for £ 750,000			1
the unconventional six - wheeled @entity6 was conjured up by engineer @entity7 in 1976 for the iconic @entity9 f1 race team			1
fitted with four smaller front wheels , the design was intended to improve its aerodynamics and improve cornering by giving it more grip on the track			1
and in 2004 it was named the most radical @entity28 car ever , picking up an emphatic 63.5 per cent of the vote in a poll by @entity28 enthusiasts ' magazine @entity31			1
now this particular model , which was raced by @entity35 @entity34 , has been put on the market by @entity38 - based race car specialists @entity39 & @entity40 for £ 750,000			1
the car , which has been meticulously maintained , is race ready - making it the ultimate toy for wealthy amateurs itching to take to the track			1
@entity34 picked up five podium spots in the two seasons he raced the @entity6 , helping @entity25 to third place in the 1976 @entity48 alongside @entity50 teammate @entity49			1
dubbed ' the six - wheeler ' , the @entity6 was fitted with two sets of ten - inch front wheels to maximise the contact area between rubber and tarmac to boost grip through corners			1
although the car was powered with a 3 - litre v8 engine that could muster a roaring 465bhp , the lightweight vehicle tips the scales at just 595kg			2
@entity49 picked up a victory in his @entity6 that 1976 season - with the pair picking up a one - two at the @entity66 @entity65			1
but the race driver left the team at the end of the season and described the @entity6 as a ' piece of junk '			2
one careful owner : the car , which has been meticulously maintained , is race ready - making it the ultimate toy for wealthy amateurs itching to take to the track pretty nippy : although the car is powered with a 3 - litre v8 engine that can muster a roaring 465bhp , the lightweight vehicle tips the scales at just 595kg the @entity6 failed to maintain its momentum in 1977 as @entity25 finished fifth overall - with the model for sale competing twice in races where @entity34 finished third and fourth			1
@entity39 & @entity40 's @entity86 said : ' it was an extraordinary , innovative car when it was launched and something that would n’t happen today			2
the classic car market is enormous , with people investing in them as tangible assets			2
' this is a fantastic opportunity as cars like this just do n’t come up for sale			2
it has spent a lot of time in a museum but it is all ready to go			0
' the car ’s iconic designer , @entity7 , passed away this year at the age of 79			2
its driver @entity34 was tragically killed in 1980 while testing a new vehicle in @entity105 , @entity106			1
unique : fitted with four smaller front wheels , the design , which shocked the @entity28 world , was intended to improve its aerodynamics and improve cornering by giving it more grip on the track contender : the model on sale was raced by @entity35 @entity34 , who drove it to five podium spots in two seasons , positions which helped @entity25 win the @entity125 ' championship @entity126 , editor of motorsport website @entity127 , described the @entity6 as unique car which shocked the world of @entity28			1
' the word " unique " is overused and abused			0
but the @entity6 was exactly that : the only six - wheeled @entity28 racer to win a @entity65 , ' he said			0
' just looking at this car you can imagine the shocked faces among the @entity28 establishment when it took to the track - and beat them			0
' the @entity140 was a decade of weird and wonderful @entity28 cars			0
' but even among that strange breed of racing machines this was something remarkably different			0
a classically @entity28 piece of lateral thinking			0
' but pity the poor mechanics who had 50 per cent more work to do during every pit stop			0
' mr @entity126 believes the @entity25 is deserving of its six - figure price - tag and added it would make an enviable addition to any racing car collection			0
' @entity25 was a great @entity9 @entity28 success story and a name that is sadly missing from the sport today , ' he said			0
' while this concept of theirs may not have proved to be the future of f1 racing , it ’s a fascinating piece of its past			0
