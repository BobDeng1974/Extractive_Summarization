one of my favourite sayings comes from the legendary @entity3 chef @entity2			1
when cooking , he said that you must never forget the mantra : ‘ @entity7 ! @entity9 - moi du beurre ! toujours du beurre ! ’ these words , taken from his book @entity14 , mean : ‘ @entity15 ! give me butter ! always butter ! ’ @entity18 says there is no substitute for butter , and that a little bit of the spread is essential to his life @entity2 , who was awarded three @entity26 stars for his cooking at @entity29 restaurant near @entity30 after @entity31 , also once observed that one should ‘ never trust a thin chef ’			1
it is for such passionate pronouncements on food that @entity36 is the chef i ’d most like to have cook me lunch			0
i have always known that just a little butter is essential in my life			1
delicious to cook with or to eat just as it is , it richly flavours endless dishes			0
so , what a joy it is to read that , after years of margarine dominating our supermarket shelves , butter is back			1
sales have risen by 7 per cent over the past five years , while those of margarine have fallen by 6 per cent			0
butter has precious few competitors			1
it is a unique product , extraordinarily versatile , relatively inexpensive and , even at the lower end of the quality ladder , most acceptable melting on to hot toast or just - boiled new potatoes			0
my late father , when eating toast for breakfast , would add butter to each ‘ bite ’ of his toast			1
rather than buttering the slice all at once , the first corner would receive a generous smear , then he would eat that and put the slice back down			0
having read about half a page of his newspaper — the @entity76 , as it happens — he would then butter the bit of toast that would form his next bite , applying a little more this time			1
sometimes there would be a ratio of more butter than toast , simply because he loved the taste so much			1
@entity88 was never overweight and lived until he was 89			0
butter has been unfairly demonised and , of course , if you eat too much of it you might become fat			1
if you eat too much of anything , you may get even fatter			0
and , furthermore , if you eat too much all the time and sit on your bottom all day , you could get very fat indeed			0
' delicious to cook with or to eat just as it is , it richly flavours endless dishes			0
so , what a joy it is to read that , after years of margarine dominating our supermarket shelves , butter is back ' that little lecture is sharply given , maybe , but the moral is simple : a little bit of butter ; not too much			1
my initiation to the joys of butter began early			1
at the age of 16 , i was taken on as an apprentice during school holidays in the kitchen of @entity122 restaurant , not far from where i grew up in @entity123 , near @entity124			1
the @entity3 owners , as you might imagine , hailed from @entity127 , so butter was a big thing with them and there was a lot of it about			1
boxes and boxes were imported from @entity135 every two months			0
and @entity138 butter it most certainly was , complete with a picture of @entity140 printed on each wrapper			1
in those days , the early @entity143 , unsalted butter was rare indeed			1
it seemed so pale in comparison to our more tasty , yellow , salted , branded butters bought from the supermarket			0
' when asked whether i would choose best dairy butter over the finest extra virgin olive oil as the preferred grease in my life , then i absolutely know the answer			1
it will be butter , every time ' yet , i soon came to love its delicacy , with a purity so suited to the rich @entity3 cooking i was there to learn			1
there was no skimping at @entity122			0
each day we would make a quantity of sauce hollandaise — enough to last an evening ’s service			0
the recipe called for ten packets of this beautiful butter			1
melted , then clarified to remove the water and milk solids , leaving only butterfat , it would be hand - whisked into 30 egg yolks — already whipped to a thick mousse over a low heat — until the mixture formed a glossy , thick emulsion			0
for this keen , teenage cook , that hollandaise was my introduction to the magic of butter			1
as a chef , i am often asked about my preference for one ingredient over another			1
such questions can be irritating — surely it depends on the recipe ? however , when asked whether i would choose best dairy butter over the finest extra virgin olive oil as the preferred grease in my life , then i absolutely know the answer			1
it will be butter , every time			1
and , anyway , we do dairy well in this country , and not much olive oil			0
i will always want my morning poached egg laid upon a slice of thickly buttered , soft white toast rather than oil - soaked bruschetta			0
and it is only best butter that makes scrambled eggs taste so good			1
an omelette without butter is unthinkable			1
though a @entity212 tortilla made with onions quietly stewed in olive oil may be fabulous when perfectly executed , it will always be a secondary treat compared with onions stewed in butter			2
asparagus , too , is glorious eaten warmly buttered			0
and if i ever found that my @entity219 sprouts were shined with olive oil rather than butter , i would regrettably have to shoot the cook			2
the onions that begin the making of a risotto , i have always believed , should be gently stewed in butter , rather than olive oil			2
yet cooking onions in olive oil now seems to be the initial instruction of all risotto recipes			0
' i will always want my morning poached egg laid upon a slice of thickly buttered , soft white toast rather than oil - soaked bruschetta			0
and it is only best butter that makes scrambled eggs taste so good ' why is this ? risotto originated in northern @entity243 , where butter is the preferred , indigenous fat , so its use is as natural as can be			2
frankly , i think that most cooks have simply forgotten how to quietly cook a chopped onion in just butter			2
a pat of butter in which to scrape the crisp tip of a thin breadstick is essential			2
once , in a silly , posh restaurant — and in @entity135 , of all places ! — a tiny dish of olive oil was offered instead			0
‘ i do n’t know what to do with this , ’ i muttered angrily			0
how did we lose our daily love of butter in the first place ? when i was a child , bread always came with butter			2
but for the past 20 years our supermarkets have been filled with an absurd amount of olive oil and all kinds of tv programmes , books and cookery journalism seemed to omit butter in recipes			2
fridges were filled with tubs of so - called ‘ spreadable ’ butters blended with olive , sunflower or corn oils			0
even the @entity3 were doing them — zut alors ! for 20 years supermarkets have been filled with an absurd amount of olive oil			1
fridges were filled with tubs of ' spreadable ' butters blended with olive , sunflower or corn oils			0
even the @entity3 were doing them - zut alors ! i find such butter unpleasant to use on toast as it has an over- emulsified texture			1
it occasionally has its uses in baking , though			0
this curious stuff is surprisingly good when incorporated into a rich bread dough i make , as it remains soft at room temperature			0
it keeps bread moist once it is baked			0
i usually make soft rolls with this sort of dough			0
but i would only ever think of it as ‘ baking butter ’ , never as something to spread on my toast , thank you very much			2
thank goodness that real butter is once again restored to our affections			2
as with childhood memories of unpasteurised milk in a glass bottle or a lick of thick , pale yellow cream , there is something about a lump of butter cut with a big knife from a block that speaks of special treats			2
folded into its hand - wrapped paper package , artisan hand - churned butter seems like a present bought for oneself			2
i sometimes wonder just what the first block of my favourite @entity335 butter , churned at the end of the 19th century , tasted like			1
i imagine it being offered for sale by the farmgate , all cool , pale and creamy , by a kindly @entity343 farmer ’s wife			0
it almost sounds like a scene from a @entity347 ’s fairy story — two small children smeared with butter for roasting later , that sort of thing — but i bet it would have been utterly delicious			2
for there is nothing quite like the taste of best butter			2
@entity18 ’s book , @entity360 ( @entity361 , £ 25 ) , is out now			1

@entity18 trained in a @entity3 kitchen as a teenager
taught by @entity127 chefs , butter became his favourite ingredient
now he says the return of butter is something to be celebrated
