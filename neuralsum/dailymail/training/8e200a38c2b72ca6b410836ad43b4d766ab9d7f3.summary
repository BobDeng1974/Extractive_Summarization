you might think mobiles and computers are taking over our lives for the worse			0
but scientists have revealed our addiction to gadgetry has made us all into touch typists			0
in experiments , the average person could type 72 words a minute , hitting six keys a second with an accuracy rate of 94 per cent			1
this is despite the fact that we do n't know where the keys are , suggesting that we 're able to perform complicated tasks even when we do n't know what we 're doing			1
21st century life : a team of cognitive psychologists from @entity23 and @entity24 in the @entity25 and @entity26 found the average person to have the skills associated with touch typists a team of cognitive psychologists from @entity23 and @entity24 were studying automatism , the ability to perform actions without conscious thought or intention , when they made their discovery			1
the research , published in the journal @entity38 , found that skilled typists ca n't identify the positions of many of the keys on the qwerty keyboard while novice typists do n't appear to learn key locations in the first place			1
lead author of the study , @entity23 's dr @entity47 , said : " when you are typing away at your computer , you do n't know what your fingers do			1
" this demonstrates that we 're capable of doing extremely complicated things without knowing explicitly what we are doing			1
" one hundred students and locals completed the short typing test			1
then , they were shown a blank qwerty keyboard and given 80 seconds to write the letters in the correct location			1
on average , they typed 72 words per minute with 94 percent accuracy			1
but they could accurately place an average of only 15 letters on a blank keyboard			1
but the study also found the average person was only able to identify an average of 15 keys on a blank keyboard , suggesting we 're capable of doing complicated tasks without knowing what we 're doing for more than a century , scientists have recognised the existence of automatic behaviours of this type such as tying shoelaces to making coffee to factory assembly - line work to riding a bicycle and driving a car			1
scientists had assumed that typing also fell into this category , but had not tested it			2
what surprised them was evidence that conflicts with the basic theory of automatic learning which holds that it starts out as a conscious process and gradually becomes unconscious with repetition			0
according to the widely held theory , as you repeat the task , it becomes increasingly automatic			0
the qwerty keyboard was invented by @entity103 , a @entity104 port official , senator , and newspaper editor			2
the first attempt by @entity109 was alphabetical , but soon hit a snag - the typebars clashed because of the key arrangements			0
he rearranged the proximity of the most used letters to arrange them in a way to make the machine work			0
frequency and combinations of letters had to be considered to prevent key clashes - in essence he rejigged the letters on the machine in order to keep speeds down			0
in 1873 , @entity128 was taken on by @entity129 , which then manufactured typewriters			0
it soon became adopted as the basis not only for @entity134 but the majority of @entity137 languages as well			0
this allows you to think about other things while you performing the task but your conscious recollection of the details gradually fades away			0
but the researchers were surprised when they found evidence that the typists never appear to memorise the key positions , not even when they are first learning to type			0
evidence for this conclusion came from another experiment included in the study			0
the researchers recruited 24 typists who were skilled on the qwerty keyboard and had them learn to type on a @entity159 keyboard , which places keys in different locations			2
after the participants developed a reasonable proficiency with the alternative keyboard , they were asked to identify the placement of the keys on a blank @entity159 keyboard			1
on average , they could locate only 17 letters correctly , comparable to participants ' performance with the qwerty keyboard			2
centennial professor of psychology at @entity172 , who supervised the experiments said : ' it appears that not only do n't we know much about what we are doing but we ca n't know it because we do n't consciously learn how to do it in the first place			0
' when i was a boy , you learned to type by taking a typing class and one of the first assignments was to memorise the keyboard			2
' the lack of explicit knowledge of the keyboard may be due to the fact that computers and keyboards have become so ubiquitous that students learn how to use them in an informal , trial - and - error fashion when they are very young			2

in the study , 100 students completed a short typing test
in the experiments the average person was able to hit six keys a second .
each word was typed with a 94 per cent accuracy
but when the students were asked to label the keys on a blank keyboard , they could only identify an average of 15 letters
' this demonstrates that we 're capable of doing extremely complicated things without knowing explicitly what we are doing '
