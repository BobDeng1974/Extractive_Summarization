by @entity0 @entity1 was accused of an ‘ embarrassingly simple - minded analysis ’ yesterday after urging @entity3 to set aside its differences with @entity5 to fight radical @entity6			1
the former prime minister insisted tensions with president @entity9 over his annexation of @entity11 should not prevent cooperation to address religious extremism in the @entity14			0
mr @entity1 said the @entity16 ’s failure to send troops to @entity18 – a move violently opposed by his successor @entity20 – was a historic mistake for which @entity3 and its allies would pay a ‘ heavy price ’ let 's be friends : then - prime minister @entity1 pictured with @entity5 president @entity9 in 2007			1
mr @entity1 has called for @entity3 to set aside its differences with @entity5 over @entity11 and @entity28 to fight radical @entity6 he also insisted further @entity30 action is needed in @entity31 as part of a ‘ titanic ’ struggle against radical @entity6 , that seeks to thwart democracy			1
mr @entity1 , now the @entity16 ’s ‘ envoy ’ to the @entity14 , used a speech in @entity36 to argue that the rise of political @entity6 is a common thread running throughout the region , from @entity31 to @entity40			1
he insisted that while the ‘ ideology coming out of @entity40 and that of the @entity43 may seem to be different , in reality they amount to the same thing ’			0
failure to shake off the legacy of @entity49 and ‘ take sides ’ in support with moderates in the @entity14 could mean the 21st century is dominated by conflict rather than peaceful co-operation , he warned			0
mr @entity1 described a global crisis with its roots in ‘ a radicalised and politicised view of @entity6 , an ideology that distorts and warps @entity6 ’s true message ’			2
he conceded that partly as a result of controversy over his warsin @entity49 and @entity66 , governments in @entity61 and @entity62 had become ‘ curiously reluctant to acknowledge ’ the threat from @entity6 extremism			1
‘ on this issue , whatever our other differences , we should be prepared to reach out and cooperate with the @entity72 , and in particular , @entity5 and @entity73 , ’ he added			1
‘ on this issue also , there is a complete identity of interest between @entity14 and @entity16			0
@entity73 and @entity5 have exactly the same desire to defeat this ideology as do the @entity62 and @entity61			1
’ mr @entity1 said the @entity3 should take a ‘ very strong position ’ over @entity5 ’s annexation of part of @entity28 but insisted it was a ‘ separate issue ’			1
@entity1 speaks at @entity84 's offices in @entity36 yesterday : he said the failure to send troops to @entity18 - a move opposed by his successor @entity20 - was a mistake for which @entity3 and its allies would pay a ' heavy price ' conservative mp @entity92 , a former shadow defence minister , said mr @entity1 ’s analysis was ‘ two - dimensional ’ and ignored the potential threats from @entity5			1
‘ one can agree greatly with his analysis of the threat of totalitarian @entity97 , but he is very light touch indeed , in fact there ’s hardly a mention of the more conventional threat from @entity5 ambitions to try and reconstitute at least part of the former @entity106 empire			2
‘ i agree that it ’s a generational struggle , but in dealing with generational struggles , you ’ve got to decide which is better : interventionism or containment			0
containment proved itself in a 50 - year confrontation with communism , and containment is the best way to deal with a generational struggle against @entity97 too			0
‘ it does take more than us to decide to avoid east - west confrontation with @entity5 , it takes the @entity5 to do it as well			0
and if they ’re going to try and take over countries by force and subversion - which is what they ’re trying to do , and if @entity130 forbid they then have their eyes on the @entity132 or @entity133 that are member states of @entity30 - then frankly , important as this topic is about @entity97 , that will become even more important			0
’ @entity135 , a fellow at the @entity136 for @entity137 at the @entity138 , said that mr @entity1 ’s speech demonstrated ‘ some of the most embarrassingly simple - minded analysis i ’ve seen from a mainstream politician			2
’ he said he made ‘ a valid point ’ about an ideological battle going on in the @entity14 but his understanding of the different streams of political @entity6 was ‘ reductionist ’			0
‘ he basically comes to the conclusion that @entity97 is so dangerous that we have to ally ourselves with authoritarian regimes			2
he has become one of the @entity16 ’s main apologists for what has become a brutal regime in @entity155 , ’ he added .			0

@entity1 used speech to issue warning about the rise of ' political islam '
he calls for @entity73 and @entity5 to *join* @entity62 and @entity61 in opposition to it
but *critics* accuse the former *pm* of *cosying* up to authoritarian regimes
