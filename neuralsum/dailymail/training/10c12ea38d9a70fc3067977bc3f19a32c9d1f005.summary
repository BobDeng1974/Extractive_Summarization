by @entity0 coping with a newborn baby can be tough			0
so spare a thought for @entity3 – who has had to do it twice in the space of just nine months			1
her son and daughter were born in such quick succession that they will even be in the same class at school			1
but what is just as remarkable is that the babies survived at all – after 26 - year - old miss @entity3 suffered dangerous complications during both pregnancies			1
@entity3 ( with partner @entity16 ) has defied medical odds to have two children in eight months			1
@entity19 ( left ) was born on on 6 december 2011 , at 25 weeks , and @entity16 ( right ) on september 7 , 2012 daughter @entity19 arrived 15 weeks prematurely , weighing only 1lb 3oz , while @entity16 weighed little more at 2lb when he was born 11 weeks early			1
so serious were their conditions that both were in special care units at the same time – but in hospitals 230 miles apart			0
their mother said : ‘ i ’m just so grateful they are both still with us			0
’ miss @entity3 has three older children – @entity29 , seven , @entity30 , five , and @entity31 , two – and was on the contraceptive pill when she became pregnant with @entity16			1
she said : ‘ i was absolutely petrified when i found out i was pregnant again			2
all of my children , apart from @entity29 , have been born progressively early , so i convinced myself i was going to have another very early , premature baby			2
‘ my gp said i should have a termination			0
he said [ the pregnancy ] would end up killing me and the baby and that it would n’t be fair to put me through it			2
but i said no. ’ miss @entity3 had been just 25 weeks into her pregnancy with @entity19 when she suffered a placental abruption – a condition where the placenta comes away from the wall of the womb , which can kill the unborn child			1
ms @entity3 and partner @entity16 ( pictured ) already had three older children ; @entity29 , seven ; @entity30 , five and @entity31 , two			1
all five were conceived in spite of precautions miss @entity3 believes that if @entity19 had been born days earlier at 24 weeks – the legal limit for an abortion – medics would not have even tried to save her			1
even after the baby was delivered by emergency caesarean in december 2011 , doctors warned @entity58 and her partner @entity59 , 36 , that she was unlikely to survive			1
@entity19 had a catalogue of health problems , including chronic lung disease and heart and bowel defects , and was put on a ventilator to help her breathe			0
she also suffered several life - threatening infections and , at her lowest point , dropped to 9oz in weight			0
at the age of ten months , she suffered liver failure , six heart attacks , seizures and brain damage			0
doctors told @entity58 and mr @entity59 , who run a martial arts club together , that there was nothing more they could do			0
the couple had her baptised , began planning a funeral and were only 90 minutes from turning off her life support when , against the odds , she began to respond			0
miss @entity3 said : ‘ we were having a final cuddle with her before turning off the life - support machine when she suddenly woke up , started looking around and moving her arms and legs			2
‘ within 24 hours she was off the life support , out of intensive care and breathing on her own			0
the doctors could n’t explain it , it was a miracle			0
she ’s such a fighter			0
’ a month before that , in september , @entity16 had been delivered , also by emergency caesarean after @entity58 suffered another placental abruption			2
when baby @entity19 was born at 25 weeks , she was the smallest baby ever to be born in @entity101 , weighing just 1lb 3oz , and doctors feared she would not survive @entity19 was so ill that her family had started arranging her funeral and gave her a hasty baptism doctors have been stunned at the ' medical impossibility ' of @entity19 ( pictured ) and her brother being born so close together he spent eight weeks in special care before being allowed home in november			1
miss @entity3 , from @entity111 , north wales , said : ‘ it has been very hard , at one point we were travelling to @entity116 for @entity19 and @entity16 was 230 miles away in the special care baby unit at @entity118			1
the doctors do n’t know how much damage @entity19 has suffered			0
she is still fed through a tube in her stomach , she ca n’t swallow or sit up , she is like a newborn			0
@entity16 appears to be fine , he is just a bit small			2
’ miss @entity3 , who is waiting for an operation to be sterilised , added : ‘ it will be nice that they are so close when they are older			1
‘ hopefully , they will be in the same class and @entity16 will be able to look after his big sister			2
’ @entity16 was born on the cut - off day for their local catholic school , @entity134			1
if he had arrived just a day later , he would have been in the year below @entity19			0
@entity19 is now 13 months old and weighs 12lb 14oz , while @entity16 , who is just over four months , weighs 7lb 14oz .			2

@entity3 , 26 , had her daughter @entity138 on 6 december 2011 , at 25 weeks
seven weeks later become pregnant again with @entity16 , born at 29 weeks
was on the waiting list to be sterilised when she discovered pregnancy
become pregnant with four previous children while using contraception
