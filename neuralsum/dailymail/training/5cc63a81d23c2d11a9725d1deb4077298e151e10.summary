the devastating effects of a 22,000lb bomb used by the @entity2 to help end the @entity3 are set to be laid bare as archaeologists investigate a remote test site in the @entity6			1
the ' @entity7 ' , which was designed to simulate the effects of an earthquake in order to cause wide - spread destruction to critical infrastructure , was @entity14 's biggest conventional weapon ever			1
the bomb was the brainchild of @entity17 , who is best known for creating the bouncing bombs used in the famous @entity20 raids in the @entity21			2
it was dropped on nine different sites in @entity24 in 1945 in a bid to damage morale and encourage the @entity27 to surrender to allied forces			1
destructive : the @entity7 bomb was the largest conventional weapon ever deployed by the @entity14 military inventor : the bomb was designed by @entity17 , creator of the @entity20 ' bouncing bombs the target of the @entity7 was key infrastructure , such as railway bridges and submarine bays , rather than built - up populated areas			1
the bomb - which @entity17 spent years developing before it was built - was tested just once , on march 13 , 1945 , when it was dropped close to a concrete bunker in the @entity6 near the town of @entity44			1
it tunnelled deep into the ground at a speed of 700mph before detonating , setting off tremors which were the equivalent of an earthquake			0
the crater left at the @entity6 test site was 70ft deep and 130ft across , and eyewitness reports suggested that the test building could be seen shaking			1
the concrete structure was originally thought to have been an imitation of a @entity24 submarine pen , but new evidence suggests that it was in fact an attempt to develop a more robust air - raid shelter , built over five and a half months at a cost of £ 250,000 ( the equivalent of more than £ 10million today )			2
test : when the bomb was dropped on a site in the @entity6 , it made a crater 70ft deep and 130ft across devastation : the site at a submarine base in @entity71 , @entity24 which was hit by a @entity7 in march 1945 after the end of the war , the site - known as @entity73 - was returned to its natural state , and the concrete bunker was encased in a mound of dirt because it could not be demolished			1
' the military had a responsibility to return it as found , ' @entity6 archaeologist @entity80 told @entity83			2
' but there 's a lot of concrete and other structures just left out there			0
' visitors to the forest can still see huge craters , an observation shelter and chalk markings made on the ground in order to help bombers find their targets			2
now researchers from the @entity6 hope to use modern scientific techniques to map the devastation caused by the @entity7 in greater detail			1
they will deploy ground - penetrating radar , electrical resistivity tomography and magnetometry to work out to what extent the bunker was damaged by the bomb			0
archaeologists are banned from digging near the site , because of the area 's status as part of a national park and its use as a commons for the grazing of ponies and cattle			0
site : an observation shelter situated at the @entity6 bombing range where the @entity7 was tested , which is now being investigated by archaeologists despite its image as a peaceful , bucolic patch of @entity125 , the @entity6 was actually central to the war effort as one of the most active test sites in the country			1
as well as the @entity7 , tanks and bouncing bombs were first tried out in the forest , while the area also hosted nine air fields			2
researchers hope that their hi - tech tools will enable them to reconstruct the history of the site in greater detail than ever before			0
mr @entity80 said the new research could help the public learn more about the role played by the forest in the war			0
' we can create 3d models of all that data that we can have people interact with , ' he said			0
' some of our most recent history is some of our rarest - people are focussed on @entity152 and @entity153 history and ignore the @entity3			0
' it 's only recently that interest in @entity3 history and archaeology has picked up			0
' the @entity7 bomb , also known as ' @entity7 ' , was the largest conventional weapon ever to be developed by the @entity14 military			2
it was designed by @entity17 , inventor of the bouncing bomb used by the @entity20 , as a way of destroying key sites without having to hit them directly			1
he came up with the idea at the beginning of the @entity3 , but it was not until towards the end of the conflict that it finally attracted support from top brass and went into production			0
the bomb was dropped from a @entity177 bomber and hit the ground at speeds of up to 700mph , tunnelling as deep as 40m into the earth			2
success : @entity24 surrendered soon after the introduction of the @entity7 , which obliterated the @entity185 submarine pens it then detonated inside the ground after a nine - second delay , setting off huge vibrations which imitated the effect of an earthquake			1
this meant that structures could be damaged or even destroyed by the bomb as long as it fell within a few hundred metres			0
the @entity7 only had to be tested once , in the @entity6 in march 1945 - the effect was so extreme that @entity2 chiefs instantly knew it was ready to be used in the air campaign against @entity24			1
the next day , one of the bombs was dropped on a railway viaduct in @entity202 , causing around 100m to collapse in a bid to interrupt @entity24 transport and communications			0
aerial : a photograph of the moment when the @entity7 hit a railway viaduct in @entity24 the day after being tested in the @entity6 in total , 42 @entity209 were deployed on nine different sites , including train bridges , gun batteries and structures housing u-boat submarines			1
the use of the bomb contributed to the aerial assault on @entity24 which convinced senior nazis that the war had finally been lost , leading to the final surrender in may 1945			1
after the end of the @entity3 , there were still 57 @entity209 left , but they would never be used in combat again			0
only five complete bombs still survive - they are on display at the @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and the @entity231 .			0

the @entity7 , designed by @entity17 , created *underground* ' earthquakes ' which could destroy targets without a direct hit
it was tested in the @entity6 on march 13 , 1945 , making a huge crater
the bomb was then used to attack infrastructure at nine @entity24 sites
scientists are now researching the test site using modern *technology*
