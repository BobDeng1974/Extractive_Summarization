she managed to escape at midnight after running in the pitch black to a nearby house when he had his trousers round his knees			2
yesterday as heavily - tattooed @entity12 was jailed for 20 years , his victim told the @entity33 that she felt ‘ let down ’ by the justice system that had freed him prematurely and given him the opportunity to attack			1
‘ no sentence he is given will ever change what ’s happened to me , ’ the receptionist , who is engaged to be married , said			2
‘ i feel very , very lucky to be alive			2
it was a terrifying , degrading experience			1
i battle with the memory of what happened every day and nothing will ever be the same again			1
‘ a decision was made to release him and that needs to be questioned , he should n’t have been free			2
there should be measures put in place to stop dangerous criminals being released automatically halfway through their sentence			2
’ she added : ‘ my challenge is to cope with what ’s happened and not let it ruin my life			2
if i let this dominate the next 40 years then i wo n’t have lived , it will be me that ’s been imprisoned			0
‘ he is a dangerous man and all that matters is that he is no longer free to go on and do this to someone else			0
’ dangerous : @entity12 , pictured , was freed despite having 26 convictions included attempting to kidnap a woman @entity68 heard that her ordeal began shortly after 3pm on june 14 last year when @entity12 attacked her while she was running with her spaniel dog along @entity73 , a public footpath , which runs close to the @entity75			1
the 6ft 3ins convict shoved her into woodland and told her : ‘ i ’ve been watching you for two weeks			0
i know where you live			0
if you say anything to anyone i ’ll hurt you and hurt your family			0
’ she said : ‘ one minute i was running along the footpath , the next i was being taken off into the woods			0
he had his arm around my neck in a headlock and was much stronger than me			0
i was in shock , i felt like it was n’t real , but it was			0
’ he tied her up then ordered her to strip naked and began a series of humiliating sexual attacks , which led to him being charged with eight counts of rape , two of assault , one of false imprisonment and possession of a knife			1
‘ i was terrified and just froze , ’ the woman said			2
‘ i was pleading with him over and over , saying , “ do n’t hurt me , do n’t hurt me ”			0
i just did n’t want to believe it was happening to me			0
’ the woman , who still suffers nightmares , said her ‘ survival instincts ’ took over			2
she kept telling @entity12 , who kept his face obscured with a scarf , that she could n’t identify him in the hope that he would let her go , and left a trail of her clothes for police to find should she not make it out alive			1
she said : ‘ i thought to myself “ is this how my life ends ? ”			0
’ she eventually escaped and told police her attacker had a tattoo ‘ @entity124 ’ on his knuckles			0
he was caught five days later			0
he claimed the sex was consensual after a ‘ brief passionate encounter ’ but the jury dismissed his ‘ ludicrous ’ account and found him guilty after a four - day trial last month			1
judge @entity132 handed @entity12 , who refused to enter the dock to hear his fate , an extended sentence , which means he must serve two thirds of his 20 - year term before being eligible for release			1
he will spend his first four years of freedom on a strict licence			0
‘ this is the worst case of rape i ’ve ever had the misfortune to come across , ’ the judge said			0
‘ i ’ve not a shadow of a doubt that @entity12 is a very dangerous man			1
’ the court heard @entity12 had been freed on licence from @entity148 , in @entity149 , two days before the attack after serving three years of a six - year sentence for kidnap and robbery			1
under the @entity156 , anyone serving a sentence of 12 months or more is automatically released on licence mid-way through			0
his previous convictions – including one from 2000 , when he was jailed for six years for attempted kidnap of a young woman – was not deemed serious or relevant enough to keep him inside .			1

@entity12 , 37 , attacked the woman at knife - point in nine - hour ordeal
he already had 26 convictions for more than 130 offences , including kidnap
his victims says she ' battles every day ' with the ' terrifying ' experience
