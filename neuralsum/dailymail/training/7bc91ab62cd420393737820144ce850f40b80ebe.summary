an anti-wrinkle cream said to be so effective it has convinced women not to have cosmetic surgery is going on sale this week			1
during tests it was said to have reduced the signs of ageing in just seven days			1
that could explain why 60,000 are said to have signed up for it on waiting lists			2
' miracle ' ingredient : @entity14 says @entity15 stops the slowdown in production of proteins that causes us to develop lines and wrinkles @entity14 , which is selling the cream for £ 30 , says it contains an ingredient that boosts production of collagen and elastin , which give skin its youthful plumpness and elasticity			1
as we age , production of these proteins rapidly slows , leaving us to develop lines and wrinkles			0
@entity14 says @entity32 , the cream ’s ‘ miracle ’ ingredient , steps in to stop this slowdown			1
in tests , 69 women aged between 35 and 59 used the @entity40 cream twice a day for 11 weeks			1
all claimed their wrinkles had been reduced , with some improvements noticeable in a week			2
some even decided against cosmetic surgery after using it , the firm said			1
dermatologists used a 3d imaging camera to look at the skin ’s response and claimed the cream had thickened the epidermis – the outer layer of the skin			2
another test on skin cells suggested they expressed more collagen and elastin after being treated with the cream			2
@entity58 , a @entity59 cosmetic dermatologist who was not involved in the study , said : ‘ it seems to deliver the kind of results i ’m unaccustomed to seeing with other mass skincare brands			0
‘ it has great potential to work with other proven ingredients like vitamin - a derivatives and vitamin c , making this potentially one of the most exciting breakthroughs i ’ve seen in recent years			0
’ goodbye @entity72 ? some women involved in the product trial even decided against cosmetic procedures after using the cream @entity32 , which stands for @entity77 33 , is a modified protein discovered by scientists in @entity80 , @entity81 , and licensed to @entity14			1
dr @entity58 said : ‘ loss of collagen occurs as we age , leading to a loss of firmness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles			0
‘ there are a number of ways to lose collagen – one important one is the failure of immature collagen strands to properly bond together into “ ropes ”			0
if this does n’t happen properly the non-useful collagen piles up , doing nothing and then gets broken down			0
‘ this happens as we get older			0
@entity102 seems to stimulate this process , unblocking this failure in the assembly line , so skin behaves more youthfully			0
’ @entity107 from @entity14 ’s research and development department said the ingredient had the power to change the way women look after their skin			1
‘ a-f33 is potentially as game changing in the fight against wrinkles as alpha hydroxyl acids ( @entity119 ) and @entity120 were in the 1990s , ’ he said			0
the cream goes on sale on the @entity14 website on friday or is available from the company ’s famous @entity14 ladies			1
fans include actress @entity127 , 36 , who said she noticed ‘ an immediate difference to my skin which appeared smoother with a fabulous glow to it ’ .			0
