@entity0 got more than she bargained for during a shopping trip yesterday - when her romantic boyfriend proposed to her via a huge 23ft tv screen			1
ms @entity0 26 , was at the @entity5 shopping centre in @entity6 with her partner when a video of her daughter @entity9 was broadcast to shoppers			1
then her partner @entity11 , 43 , appeared on the huge 23ft by 13ft screen , went down on one knee and popped the question			1
fortunately , she said yes to the proposal he had taken her along to the shopping mall after telling her he had won a prize in a competition which he needed to collect			1
family members including aunts , and uncle were also hiding nearby after finding out about the proposal plans only days before			2
and as they were waiting to collect the ' prize ' @entity11 's video flashed up on screen			1
she said : ' i thought what the hell is going on here ? i kind of smelt a rat			0
' i thought it seemed a bit much for a competition			0
then i saw @entity9 on screen and i wondered how they managed to get those images because she was dressed differently			0
' i was shocked , i can be quite shy sometimes			0
i saw family members nearby when we were waiting so i thought something might be up			0
' she looked speechless as she saw her partner on the big screen before he got down on one knee on screen to present a sparkling diamond ring			0
the engagement ring @entity11 bought his partner - which she happily accepted the couple , pictured after their engagement at @entity5 mall , have been together for two - and - a - half years the couple have been together for two - and - half - years and he had been planning to propose for a while			1
the driver for @entity66 's said : ' i 've been thinking about it for quite a wee while but i could n't afford to get a ring at the time			0
' i was n't planning something as big as this and i was worried about how she would react			0
@entity73 engaged @entity0 and @entity11 with their 14 - month old daughter @entity74 and @entity11 's stepson @entity76 ' i just thought about what i wanted to do for a while			1
' the video was brilliant and i could n't wait for it to be shown on the big screen			2
' i liked the idea of proposing in the video because as well as being very unusual , it was also quite personal			0
' @entity0 knows every time i do something i like to push the boat out and do n't do things low - key			2
' mr @entity11 also has a 10 - year - old stepson , @entity76 who was at @entity5 to see the unusual proposal alongside their daughter @entity74			1
the full - time mum - who said yes - said the pair would celebrate with a few glasses of champagne to get over the shock			1
she said : ' we 're definitely going to have a glass of bubbly - or maybe a few bottles to get over the shock			0
' the proposal video was played yesterday afternoon in between the latest music videos , news bulletins and adverts normally shown on the screen			1
in the video , he said : ' @entity0 , surprise ! bet you were n't expecting to see me here			2
' i told you a wee bit of a lie on monday when i said i was going to see the mortgage adviser			0
' i was over in @entity114 making this video and i feel as if it 's time now , we have been together for a wee while - yourself , @entity76 and now we have got beautiful @entity9			0
' i want to do this - will you marry me @entity0 ? please say yes			2
