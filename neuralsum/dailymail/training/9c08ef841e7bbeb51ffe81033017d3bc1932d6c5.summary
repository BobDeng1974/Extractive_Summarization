by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 06:00 est , 15 february 2013 two conmen who swindled vulnerable elderly people out of thousands of pounds by posing as workmen have been jailed for ' bleeding ' their victims of every penny they had			1
@entity6 , 30 , and his brother - in - law @entity7 , 21 , were both jailed after they demanded money from @entity10 , 81 , and @entity11 , 86 for botched building work			1
jointly , they defrauded them of nearly £ 80,000 , and the frail pair were both forced to go into care homes after they were duped			2
yesterday @entity17 heard that @entity6 is already serving a three and a half year sentence for exploiting three vulnerable pensioners			1
the con men @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) swindled the pair out of their money as a ruse for ' building work ' it was only when widow mrs @entity10 stood up to her tormentors that her family and the police realised that she had been exploited by the pair who posed as workmen and carried out shoddy building ' repairs ' to her home			1
mrs @entity10 was charged well in excess of £ 6,000 for a botched building repair which - even if it had been carried out competently - was valued at just £ 30			1
nephew @entity35 said his aunt had a clock on her mantel piece which she treasured because it had been given to her by her late husband @entity39			0
when the men threatened to take the clock unless she wrote them another cheque she was so frightened that she called mr hall 200 miles away in @entity43			0
mr @entity35 , 64 , an assistant investigator for @entity44 , called police - and what the judge called @entity7 and @entity6 's ' conspiracy ' to target the elderly finally began to unravel			1
@entity51 , prosecuting for @entity50 , told the court : ' @entity6 has made a career out of targeting elderly and vulnerable victims			1
victim @entity10 paid £ 6,000 for a job that should have cost £ 30 ' his activities have generated a large amount of money over a number of years			1
' @entity7 made it his business to identify house - holders who could be easily over charged for gardening or property work			1
' in the current case , he was able to find two ideal victims			0
' both were elderly people , both lived alone , and both suffered from dementia			0
' mrs @entity10 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , who suffered from memory loss , was conned out of nearly £ 6,000 before she told her nephew she was being threatened			1
the same day she went into a home where she still resides			0
' she was placed into care very rapidly and as a direct consequence of the fraud , ' mr @entity51 added			0
both her bank and the village postmistress became suspicious and cheques were stopped - but by then the men had moved on to widower mr @entity11 , of @entity84 , near @entity85 , who they stole £ 72,000 from			2
he was charged for ' building and gardening ' work , but when his home was examined by an expert surveyor and an arboriculturalist , no evidence could be found of any work at all having been carried out			0
mr @entity51 added : ' he would leave large piles of cash lying around his house			0
he was the perfect victim for @entity7 and @entity6			1
' his daughter @entity98 returned from @entity99 to find not only was no substantial work carried out on the property , but a number of valuables had been stolen			0
he has now had to go into a care home			0
defending counsel asked the recorder of @entity108 @entity107 to consider both men 's guilty pleas and that @entity7 was of previous good character			1
@entity6 , who was jailed last year for the @entity113 offences , was sentenced to four and a half years for six fraud and money laundering offences			1
one of his previous victims , an 82 - year - old woman from @entity118 who @entity6 conned into driving to her bank on her mobility scooter to withdraw £ 3,500 for gardening work			1
he duped her into believing she would be fined £ 7,000 unless she had some conifers removed			2
the judge told him : ' from 2008 to 2012 you have set about a determined targeting of vulnerable , infirm and elderly victims			2
' ' you did so out of one motive and one motive only - sheer greed			1
' what you did was to bleed these victims of what little money they had left ' ' you did so without any thought or care for the consequences of your offending			2
' you had no thought at all of the misery you would cause to those you targeted in the latter part of their lives			0
' in all probability , it caused mrs @entity10 to go into care prematurely			1
you gave no thought whatsoever to any of that			0
' what you did - both of you - was to bleed these victims of what little money they had left and in the case of the gentleman it was a very considerable amount of money			2
' you have set out in quite a determined way to commit these offences and do not let the inconvenience of being arrested stop you in any way throughout your career as a criminal			0
' @entity7 , of @entity163 , @entity118 , admitted 13 fraud and money laundering offences			1
jailing @entity7 for three years , the judge told him it would have four if it was not for his early guilty plea			2
outside court , mr @entity35 said his aunt and other elderly victims had been robbed of their last few years of independent living			2
' these people are from a generation which believes there is good in everyone			0
they do n't realise there are bad people out there trying to take their money , " he said			0
' it was probably these despicable people taking the clock that made my aunt take a stand			0
they said unless they got a cheque they would take it			0
' county council @entity191 said : ' victims such as this have a right to live their last years in comfort and security and not to be targeted by abhorrent defendants such as these			0

two conmen robbed vulnerable pensioners of their money and independence
victim @entity10 paid £ 6,000 for a job that should have cost £ 30
@entity6 and @entity7 were motivated out of ' sheer greed '
