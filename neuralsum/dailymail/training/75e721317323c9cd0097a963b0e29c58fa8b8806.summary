the abandoned summer resorts of @entity4 's @entity2 and @entity3 counties are a ghostly , eerie and bizarrely beautiful reminder of the halcyon days of the holiday playground known as the @entity7			1
popular with the middle class @entity9 , hence the nickname , and within easy driving distance from @entity13 , they were the height of glamour and recreation for families heading to the @entity18			2
those unfamiliar with the area need look no further than the film @entity21 , for which it 's the setting , or better still this series of stunning images			0
many of the area 's finest hotels , that were at the peak of their pomp in the 1960s , have simply been left to rot these days yet maintain much of their majesty in these pictures			0

the @entity7 is the name given to an area of @entity4 popular with @entity9 americans
at its height the area boasted more than *600* hotels and summer camps , and was the height of @entity18 glamour
now with many of them abandoned , photographers have *flocked* to *document* them as they *evolve*
