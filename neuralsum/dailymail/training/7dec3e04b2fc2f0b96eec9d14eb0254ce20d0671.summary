@entity0 and @entity1 are being investigated by @entity2 for alleged breaches of the controversial salary cap system which could see them hit with hefty points deductions and fines			1
@entity8 has learned an inquiry is under way following ‘ whistleblower ’ testimony			2
it appears to substantiate allegations that clubs are flouting rules aimed at maintaining financial stability among top - flight teams			0
saracens , backed by a consortium of @entity22 - based businesses , mounted a pre-emptive public relations campaign calling for the abolition of the £ 5.5million annual cap			0
they claim it is ‘ outdated ’ and ‘ possibly illegal ’			0
saracens are facing heavy fines and point deductions over alleged breaches of salary cap regulations but it has emerged a whistleblower — understood to be a disgruntled player ’s agent — has complained to premier @entity2 ’s recently appointed salary - cap auditors about the way @entity0 structure payments to overseas players			1
under scrutiny is how @entity0 ’ @entity22 players are recompensed , with allegations that payments are routinely made into offshore accounts to avoid the cap			2
‘ @entity0 have been backed into a corner and that ’s why they ’ve come out and said what they ’ve said at this particular time , ’ said one source			2
‘ a whistleblower has dished the dirt			0
’ the investigation into @entity0 is also understood to focus on the deal to bring the former @entity58 lock @entity57 to @entity59			2
@entity1 have also drawn attention to themselves after a number of large offers made to recent targets @entity1 have drawn attention because of a number of recent big - money offers made to transfer targets , including @entity67 and @entity68 fly - half @entity69 and @entity72 back - row star @entity71			2
the recommended sanctions for breaches of the cap are severe			0
clubs found guilty of exceeding it by £ 75,000 face a four - point deduction , but that figures rises to a maximum of 40 points for a breach of more than £ 250,000			2
there are possible fines of £ 3 for every £ 1 over the cap , rising to £ 10 per £ 1 for a third offence , which could see a club incur a potentially crippling £ 2.5m fine for breaches of over £ 250,000			2
the scale of the alleged breaches is yet to be established			0
@entity0 chief executive @entity92 said the cap had to go for @entity95 teams to compete in @entity96 a @entity98 spokesman said : ‘ @entity98 can not comment on whether investigation proceedings are taking place or not			1
any such investigation would be done under the salary capping regulations 2013 - 14			2
’ @entity0 indicated they have the backing of six other @entity98 clubs — although a @entity8 investigation failed to find significant support			1
@entity0 , widely viewed as a commercial pioneer for @entity95 professional rugby , have long since objected to the salary cap			1
the @entity112 club believe the cap is a restraint of trade			0
they say it hampers clubs ’ ability to compete with rich @entity121 giants like @entity122 and @entity123 — who this week signed @entity126 @entity125 on a deal worth around £ 800,000 per season			0
@entity128 lifts the @entity130 trophy for @entity122 , who defeated @entity0 23 - 6 in the final @entity1 have received huge financial backing from their new millionaire owner @entity134 in recent seasons			1
‘ the salary cap has served its purpose , ’ said @entity0 chief executive @entity92			1
‘ it would be a pity if the world ’s top players light up the @entity142 on @entity95 soil and then leave to play club rugby in @entity121			0
' if the salary cap is left to forbid the required investment , it will kill any hope of growth			1
’ a premier @entity2 statement read : ‘ the salary cap ensures the financial viability of the member clubs and underpins the sustainable growth of the competition for all stakeholders			1
‘ in addition , the salary cap provides a level playing field for all clubs , ensures a competitive @entity163 competition , promotes homegrown players and supports the performance of the @entity95 team			1
‘ it allows the recruitment of elite players from other countries through the excluded players provision			0
’ @entity0 ’ claim that they have significant support appeared unfounded			1
@entity125 , who has just agreed to sign for @entity123 , chose @entity121 over the @entity98 @entity175 chief executive @entity174 said : ‘ we believe at @entity175 that the salary cap should be higher than it is but we do n’t think it should be abolished			1
we ’d support it being raised to around £ 7.5 - £ 8m to put us on a par with a lot of the @entity121 clubs			0
’ @entity183 , whose 24,000 - capacity @entity185 stadium and large fan - base sees them generate the highest revenues from ticket sales in the @entity98 , also appear to be against an abolition			0
a club insider said : ‘ the club is already stretched to the maximum by paying up to the salary cap			1
there ’s no appetite to abolish the cap			0
it would be disastrous for @entity183			0
’ @entity200 distanced themselves from @entity0 while @entity201 are understood to have told @entity2 they have no interest in scrapping the cap			1
@entity125 will become rugby 's highest - paid player in the world when he joins @entity123			0
