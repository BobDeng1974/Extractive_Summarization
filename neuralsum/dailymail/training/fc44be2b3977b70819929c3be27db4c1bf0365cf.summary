mrs @entity7 's daughter @entity56 , who lives in @entity57 , said her mother had lived in the house for 65 years before suffering her stroke			1
it had left her partially paralysed and in need of 24 - hour care - and the problem with the squatters made her stressed at a time when she needed to recover			1
her daughter said : ' the agents had been carrying out a viewing and arrived at the house to find all these people inside			2
' i rang the police to inform them about trespassers			1
' i rang again on october 6 , whereupon the police went to our property with our agent and gave these so - called tenants seven days ' notice to vacate because they were trespassing			2
' it is believed the squatters got into the house as decorators did it up and managed to steal a set of house keys			2
she added : ' there were about 14 people but only four said they were renting and 10 were visiting			0
' @entity91 were seen strewn over the floors of the bedrooms and there was evidence of smoking			0
' although we were given a crime reference number by the police they told our solicitor it was a squatter trespass but should be treated as a civil matter			2

@entity127 mp for @entity128 , who was asked to help by the family 's solicitor , yesterday accused the police of ' a lack of common sense '			1
he said : ' i was very concerned that the police were inferring that they could n't take any action and that it was a civil matter			2
' what we have seen here is a lack of common sense from the police and a lack of urgency			2
i have made my opinions very clear to the police			2
' police should be careful about setting a precedence that they are a soft touch			0
' sometimes the police are too worried about being politically correct			0

the house is now boarded up , and black bags have been piled high full of rubbish a spokesman said : ' initially the tenant and the estate agents had put in civil measures to try to remove the occupants from the property , however that was not successful			0
' that decision was reviewed by a more senior officer and it was decided that these people were acting illegally and officers intervened			0
' four men and two women were asked to pack their things and vacate the property which they did and no force was needed			0
' officers will be looking further into the matter and also into the way the issue was handled			0
' a elderly woman who lived near to mrs @entity7 said she was a ' pleasant lady ' who would always ask people in for a sherry			1

she said : ' she was a nice woman , well educated and a pleasure to speak to			0
she would walk past two times a day with her little dog			0
