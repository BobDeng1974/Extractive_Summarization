the 24 - year - old , who played @entity18 in @entity20 ’s @entity19 , is understood to be distraught after three clips of her naked were apparently stolen from her @entity23 account			1
the videos have now been viewed more than a million times online			0
last night , in the face of mounting pressure , @entity4 finally took action – but only after one 54 - second video had been available via its search engine for at least eight hours			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ searches for “ @entity13 ” no longer deliver the video on the front page , which should limit its exposure			1
’ and in a separate move last night , the website that had hosted the video posted a message saying : ‘ this video has been suspended either due to a copyright claim , or for breaching the terms of use			1
’ the @entity19 star is one of around 100 female celebrities on a ‘ target list ’ by anonymous hackers who have stolen dozens of intimate pictures and videos and put them online			1
@entity23 confirmed that some celebrity icloud accounts had been deliberately targeted and hacked			0
last night it said none of the cases it had so far investigated were a result of bugs in its @entity23 or find my @entity58 systems , but were a result of a ‘ very targeted attack ’ on the security procedures of celebrity accounts			0
it insisted there had not been a general security breach			0
a spokesman said : ‘ after more than 40 hours of investigation , we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions , a practice that has become all too common on the internet			2
‘ none of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of @entity23 ’s systems including @entity23 or find my @entity58			0
‘ we are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved			0
’ the videos emerged three days ago on niche internet forums and spread to the mainstream web thanks in part to @entity4 and other websites			1
the @entity86 is investigating the leak , which had left stars – including actress @entity89 , 24 , and model @entity90 , 22 – powerless to stop the images of them in various stages of undress spreading around the web and being watched millions of times			2

@entity101 mp @entity100 , who chairs the @entity103 culture committee , was among those who had called yesterday for @entity4 to stop directing search engine users to the 54 - second video , which had been watched 573,050 times by yesterday afternoon			1
links to other versions of the same video and to others were shared on a social media website and on a pornography website , gaining at least another 600,000 viewings			2
this material appears to have been obtained illegally and should be treated in the same way			0
’ @entity4 is currently classed as an ‘ aggregator ’ rather than a ‘ publisher ’ of material , so it can not be sued for providing links to offensive material			1

’ she spoke out amid fury over comedian @entity163 who tweeted : ‘ celebrities , make it harder for hackers to get nude pics of you from your computer by not putting nude pics of yourself on the computer			0
’ he quickly deleted the post , as some readers accused him of ‘ blaming the violation of a woman ’s body on her ’			0
the leaking of nude celebrity photos online has come – in a remarkable coincidence – just as a new film highlights similar concerns about storing intimate data on computers			0
in the comedy @entity186 , released in the @entity9 today , @entity188 and @entity189 star as a married couple who film themselves having sex but accidentally share the video with friends and family through @entity23 ’s @entity23 service			2
