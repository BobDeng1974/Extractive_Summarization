by @entity0 @entity1 has been ahead in the opinion polls since 2011			1
but it has never taken the commanding lead necessary to be sure of winning the next election			0
instead , its lead has been narrowing in recent months , and this week saw the publication of the first polls since 2012 showing a @entity10 lead			0
this comes as no great surprise			0
it is more of a wonder that @entity1 had the lead in the first @entity16 have consistently thought @entity17 makes a better prime minister than @entity19 would do			1
@entity1 is still being blamed by the electorate for the 2008 financial crisis , which is why @entity19 will never move into number 10 @entity23 they blame the @entity1 for the 2008 financial crisis , and now that the economy is recovering people have increasing confidence in conservative economic management , which they have nearly always preferred to the alternative offered by the two eds. the diminishing @entity1 lead is also unsurprising , because usually governments rally and oppositions fall back in the final months before a general election			1
if past election cycles are a good guide , recent polls suggest the @entity37 are likely to get the largest share of the vote in 2015 , with a two - thirds chance of winning the most seats			1
while the chances of another hung parliament or a @entity10 majority are each about 2 in 5 , @entity1 ’s chances of a majority are looking increasingly thin at less than 1 in 5			2
the numer of people intending to vote @entity1 has fallen dramatically since the beginning of the year but maybe the past is not such a good guide to the future			2
this time things might be different			0
now that we have the first post-war @entity57 government , will both governing parties recover from their mid-term doldrums ? while the @entity59 have been flat - lining at about ten per cent , the @entity37 , as expected , are doing better now than at this time last year			1
the unprecedented rise of @entity62 is also important			0
for @entity17 to recover his mid-term losses he needs to turn around former @entity37 who have defected to @entity62			1
surveys suggest this will be harder in 2015 than it was in 2010			0
@entity17 ’s challenge is on the right			2
@entity19 ’s is in the centre			2
hanging on to the former @entity59 voters who switched to labour after the coalition formed will be particularly hard in the many constituencies where the @entity59 , not @entity1 , are the main competitors for the @entity37			1
ultimately though , @entity19 ’s biggest challenge is to convince more people they want him to be prime minister			1
after years of the public consistently preferring @entity17 , it will be hard to change their minds now			0
* @entity0 is a fellow and tutor in @entity82 at @entity83 , @entity84			0

voters believe that @entity17 is a better prime minister than @entity19
@entity1 still being held *responsible* for the 2008 financial crisis by voters
@entity37 now ahead of @entity1 in the opinion polls for the first time since 2011
