by @entity0 when and where did @entity2 and modern humans first meet and interbreed ? that 's a question scientists will be hoping to answer with a treasure trove of important human fossils rediscovered by a team from the @entity10 in @entity11			1
dna analysis of the bones may shed light on the exodus of modern humans from @entity17 , and could confirm the @entity18 as the meeting point for @entity2 and humans			1
a significant haul of human fossils dating back 50,000 years have been rediscovered that could provide evidence as to how modern humanity began			1
the bones ( pictured ) were originally dug up in the 1920s and 1930s but had been lost until they were rediscovered by a team of @entity10 scientists the collection consists of boxes of bones discovered among the personal belongings of @entity34 anthropologist sir @entity33			1
sir @entity33 was the master at @entity37 , a research station of the @entity39 next to @entity41 's home , @entity42 , in @entity43			1
after sir @entity33 's death in 1955 a number of fossils were transferred from the collections at the @entity39 to the @entity48 , but this particular collection did not arrive until 2001			1
it was not until the current study was carried out that the importance of his collection became clear			2
the study , published in @entity56 , describes the work undertaken to identify and document the human skeletal material in the @entity59			0
it identified the human fossils as having come from a number of excavations directed by @entity64 in the 1920s and 1930s , in what is now @entity67			2
@entity64 was a female pioneer , the first woman to hold an @entity69 chair , and led a number of excavations at key archaeological sites in the @entity18 such as @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
she relied on sir @entity33 and @entity78 to carry out the morphological analysis of the skeletal material she discovered			1
@entity73 and @entity74 were the first sites excavated and yielded primarily @entity84 material , which was briefly described by @entity64 and @entity33			0
the study identified the human fossils as having come from a number of excavations directed by @entity64 in the 1920s and 1930s in what is now @entity67 ( map shown )			1
@entity64 led a number of excavations at key archaeological sites in the @entity18 such as @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity93 sir @entity33 ( pictured left ) was a @entity34 anatomist and anthropologist who had in his possession a significant haul of human fossils			1
on first study , they had seemed uninteresting , but upon closer inspection they were revealed to be about 50,000 - years - old			1
on the right is a fragment of a juvenile @entity2 temporal bone the older skeletal material belonging to @entity2 and early modern humans was described by @entity78 and @entity33 in 1939 in the volume ' @entity108 of @entity109 '			1
detailed descriptions of most of the fossil material were included in the book , and were the only testament to their existence			0
' we believe the collection became lost because the bombings of the @entity39 in @entity11 made it necessary to transfer the material back to safety at @entity121 , as well as @entity78 's move to @entity123 , @entity124 , in 1939 , ' said dr @entity125 from the @entity10			2
' some of the fossils date back to a key time period where @entity2 and modern humans may have co-existed in the @entity18 and @entity129			1
' very few early modern human fossils exist that date to the @entity132 and the material is therefore very significant			2
' it has the potential to answer important questions about the dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of @entity17			1
' it was not until the current study was carried out that the importance of the collection , which was received by the @entity10 in 2001 , became clear			0
here heavy damage on bone , probably due to post-excavation mechanical cleaning using a metal instrument , is seen marked by white arrows professor @entity148 , co-author and @entity149 in @entity150 at the @entity48 , added : ' it 's sometimes possible to make important finds through careful detective work on existing collections , rather than from new excavations , and this study is a great example of that			0
' the material in question had been stored , unrecognised , for about 50 years until it arrived at the museum in 2001			0
' we now know that it not only contained the lost collection of modern human fossils from @entity165 - the type site of the @entity84 industry [ 10,000 to 15,000 years ago ] in @entity67 - but also some more fragmentary , but equally important , fossils that may cover the period of overlap between the last @entity2 and the first modern humans in @entity67 , some 50,000 years ago			1
' @entity129 may be closer to their @entity2 cousins than previously thought , recent research suggests			0
breeding with @entity2 has long been known to have left its traces in the dna of modern @entity129			2
earlier this year , scientists in @entity177 confirmed the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in @entity129 and @entity180 , before our ancestors spread across the globe			0
previous research speculated that modern @entity129 and @entity180 are related to @entity2 because they originated from a similar sub-population in @entity17			2
both groups evolved from a common ancestor in @entity17 before spreading to other parts of the world			0
the two groups emerged at different times with @entity2 leaving the @entity17 continent more than 200,000 years before humans did			2
scientists at the @entity195 and @entity196 found the species mated in @entity129 and @entity180 thousands of years ago			0
the research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding			0
they traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago			0
the research found that the two per cent of neanderthal dna which exists in people today came from the mating outside of @entity17 .			0

fossils first found in the 1920s and 30s could reveal human *history* *secrets*
study was by a team from the @entity218 in @entity11
they *re-examined* the old bones and found they could be 50,000 - years - old
the fossils could *explain* how @entity2 and modern humans met
the collection once belonged to @entity34 anthropologist sir @entity33
