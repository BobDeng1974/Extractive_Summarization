upsetting : looking tired and tearful , @entity6 and @entity7 attended prayers and a candle lit service in their village to mark the sixth anniversary of the disappearance of their daughter @entity13 villagers marked the occasion with prayers and poems			1
the low - key ceremony marks six years since @entity13 , then nearly four , disappeared from her family 's holiday apartment in @entity34 in @entity36 's @entity35 on may 3 2007 , as her parents dined at a tapas restaurant with friends nearby			1

' mrs @entity46 said twins @entity41 and @entity42 , who were just two when their sister went missing , were coping well and were ' no different to any other eight - year - old child '			0
' they have grown up knowing that @entity13 is missing , she is their big sister , we 're trying to find her and she should be back home with us			2
' as they get older and they wander on the internet and other things , there will be more questions , but going by how things have panned out so far i think we will be alright , i think they 'll handle it well			0
