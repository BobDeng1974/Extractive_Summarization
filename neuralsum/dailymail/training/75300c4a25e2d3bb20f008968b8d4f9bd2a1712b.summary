here she is shown today ' we had a wonderful reference from your priest and we think you should take a baby over six months … the baby will be brought up just as you would bring your own child up and a child of two years has been too long in an institution to fall easy into your ways			0
we have a very nice little girl @entity45 who is of good background and very intelligent , ’ the nun wrote			0
speaking to the @entity47 , @entity6 said the nuns also gave her adoptive parents a book detailing how to look after a baby			1
