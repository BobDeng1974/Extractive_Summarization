speaking on @entity8 on monday , attorney @entity7 said that @entity3 , who was cleared of murdering 17 - year - old @entity9 , is considering taking action over how his case was handled			1
' if you look at this case and take away the emotion of the loss of @entity9 's life ... and look at what happened , we have a lot of political and social pressures that [ we ] normally would not ... and there may be compensation for something like that , ' @entity7 said			2

it comes as the attorneys said they would now be pursuing action against @entity45 for how it edited the 911 calls @entity3 made to dispatchers the night of february 26 , 2012			1
the edited tapes depicted @entity3 as a racial profiler after he came across the teenager walking through a @entity52 neighborhood to his father 's home , armed with nothing but a bag of sweets			1
on march 27 last year , @entity45 aired a version of the tapes which said : ' this guy looks like he 's up to no good			1
' in fact , the full tape showed @entity3 had only said @entity9 was black when asked by a dispatcher			1

' the dispatcher asked : ' ok , and this guy - is he black , white or @entity76 ? ' @entity3 said : ' he looks black			2
' he sued @entity45 for defamation over the editing last december , but the case was put on hold pending the outcome of the trial			2
@entity45 maintained that other media outlets had also highlighted the racial angle of the killing , and said that if he was convicted , this would show @entity3 's loss of reputation was his own doing , rather than that of any media outlet			1
with no conviction brought , @entity3 is now ready to move forward with the suit , one of his lawyers told the @entity103			2
' we ’re going to start in earnest asap , we just have to get the stay lifted which is a ministerial act , ' @entity104 said			0
outrage : @entity108 , 22 , of @entity109 , holds a picture of @entity9 during a protest over the verdict he added that the verdict had shown the jury did not believe @entity3 was a racial profiler and now ' it 's simply time for us to start the case and hold accountable anyone who was irresponsible in their journalism '			1

' this is the worst time in his life is n't it ? ' protests have spread across the country in the wake of the sensational not - guilty verdict			0
demonstrations - from @entity168 where the trial took place to @entity109 , @entity171 and @entity144 - remained largely peaceful , though @entity151 protesters managed to shut down an entire freeway and thousands of @entity144 mobbed @entity143 and blocked traffic for an hour			0
