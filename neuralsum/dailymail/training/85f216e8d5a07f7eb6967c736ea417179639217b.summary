it is a collection so diverse it contains adverts for @entity4 buns , plans for a bathing machine that creates a grand personal swimming pool in the sea and hastily scribbled designs for a grand palace with opulent staircases but no doors or windows			1
the thousands of papers collected by @entity14 reveals the personality of a @entity14 who was at once a proud father , eager architect and ruler with a tendency to distrust in his own ministers and want to make his own decisions			1
the collection of @entity14 has revealed 60,000 documents including drawings produced by his daughters , sensitive political documents and plans like this one drawn by the @entity14 himself which shows four opulent staircases and no means of entry and is likely to have been produced by him during a manic episode the 60,000 papers which make up he collection also reveal the monarch had a propensity to hoard documents , possibly as a form of therapy during severe bouts of mental illness and manic episodes he suffered that led him to become known as the @entity14			1
the monarch painstakingly collated the documents throughout his time as ruler and is believed to have stored it next to his bedroom in what is now @entity57			1
' this collection reveals a number of things about @entity14 , ' said @entity61 , head of map collections at the @entity63 which is cataloguing the huge haul of documents			1
' first of all it shows his human side as a proud and doting father			0
it contains drawings of @entity71 and @entity72 produced by his daughters as well as a military plan drawn up by his favourite son at the age of 13			1
' they are the sort of items that any proud father would keep			0
' it also shows a person who is very interested in his country and wanted to learn about his people			1
he collected adverts for @entity4 buns and wire railings			1
the collection contains plans for a bathing machine used by the monarch to bathe in the sea in @entity94 @entity14 built up the collection of images and maps himself , storing them at @entity57 ' and lastly it shows how he saw his role as @entity14 and felt it was important to reach his own decisions			1
' the collection contains sensitive and secret government information about @entity106 fortifications that would have been seen by the @entity14 but would usually have been returned to his ministers - indicating an innate distrust in his colleagues by the monarch who preferred to make his own decisions			1
it also betrays his keen interest in architecture , with many maps and plans from across the world , including his own scrawled designs			2
@entity14 was interested in maps and collected thousands like this plan of @entity120 upon @entity121 the ruler kept a number of documents himself as he wanted to make his own decisions rather than be guided @entity14 was interested in the development and architecture , keeping plans like this of @entity129 one of the papers features his plans for a palace at @entity133 , drawn in his characteristic enthusiastic but ' slightly obsessive ' hand			1
mr @entity61 added : ' if @entity14 had not been @entity14 he would have been an architect			2
he loved drawing plans for buildings			0
this collection contains two plans , one in pencil and the other one is rather savagely done			2
there are all sorts of strange things contained in the plan , which was probably for a large palace he was planning to build at @entity147			2
' it was probably produced during one of his manic episodes			0
it 's got four staircases whereas the greatest of rulers at this time was usually satisfied with just one			0
it also does not seem to have any entrances			0
' a map of the @entity121 was found among 60,000 documents in the collection showing an interest in the country detailed maps were a key part of the collection and it is estimated to take around two years to catalogue mr @entity61 said one of the most unique things about the collection was that the monarch built it up and used it himself , unlike his collections of scientific instruments and books which he left to his assistants to manage			1
it reveals the personal side of the @entity14 - particularly in plans for a bathing machine , popular with prudish @entity182 who wanted to swim in the sea without anyone seeing them			1
@entity14 ruled from 1760 to 1820 the @entity14 's bathing machine was particularly large , allowing him to bathe naked in the sea at @entity94 in his own form of private swimming pool without ever being seen			1
as well as the scrawled plans and legal documents the collection also contains thousands of maps , showing the interest of the ruler in the rest of the world - despite the fact he only travelled as far as @entity94			1
' he was an armchair traveller , ' said mr @entity61			0
' he did n't actually travel further than @entity94 but through books and maps he eagerly learnt about the rest of the world and was able to do a grand tour of @entity204			0
' @entity14 probably did n't travel far because he was a conscientious leader and did n't want to be away from his work for too long			2
' amongst the dozens of papers are also items the monarch is likely to have inherited , such as a ' birth certificate ' for @entity211			0
this was likely to have been presented to the @entity213 in 1664 after it was captured by the @entity106 from the @entity214 and renamed from @entity215			2
he also collected early images of @entity218 and plans for churches in @entity220			0
some of the items produced and collected by the @entity14 are likely to have been put into the collection when he suffered episodes of mania			1
mr @entity61 added : ' the 1780s and 1790s were very hard years for @entity14 as he had lost the @entity228 colonies and had these really very severe attacks of mental illness			2
@entity14 is widely referred to as the ' @entity14 ' after suffering episodes of mania during his reign			2
he reigned from 1760 to his death in 1820 - one of the longest reigns by any @entity235 monarch in history			0
the eldest son of @entity238 , @entity239 , and princess @entity240 , @entity14 succeeded his grandfather @entity241 at the age of 22 , becoming the third @entity244 monarch to reign			1
he was the first @entity244 to speak @entity106 as his first language and to be born in the country			2
he is most remembered as the king who lost the @entity228 colonies and went mad and was famously depicted in @entity249 's 1994 @entity248 of @entity14			2
but according to the @entity253 's official website , @entity14 's direct responsibility for the loss of the colonies is not great			1
he opposed their bid for independence to the end , but he did not develop the policies ( such as the @entity259 and the @entity261 duties of 1767 on tea , paper and other products ) which led to war in 1775 - 76 and which had the support of @entity267			0
@entity14 reigned from 1760 to 1820 the @entity14 suffered serious bouts of illness in 1788 - 89 and again in 1801 , @entity14 became permanently deranged in 1810			2
during his episodes he frequently withdrew to @entity271 leaving the country in crisis about who was to rule in his absence			0
in the last decade of his reign he was declared mentally unfit to rule and his eldest son - the later @entity239 - acted as @entity278 from 1811			0
some medical historians have said that @entity14 's mental instability was caused by a hereditary physical disorder called porphyria			1
this has a number of symptoms including blue urine			0
however researchers at the @entity288 recently came up with a theory that his mania was caused by mental illness			0
they analysed his letters and speech , which were known to be so long the monarch would sometimes foam at the mouth			0
the monarch would sometimes have to be held to the floor by his assistants when he suffered convulsions			0
' i think this collection was probably a sort of therapy , allowing him to escape from all of his weaknesses			0
' the @entity63 is cataloguing and digitising the collection and estimates due to its size the process could take two years			1
it is appealing for the public 's help in funding the project			0
for more information see @entity316			0
