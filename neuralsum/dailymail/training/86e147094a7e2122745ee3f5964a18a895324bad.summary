the @entity0 failed in a bid to block the £ 11.25m sale of @entity8 , @entity10 , which has been in his family for nearly 200 years trustees hope to sell the 100 - room mansion on the @entity25 , but the @entity11 , 60 , took the case to the @entity16 but three appeal judges , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , unanimously agreed to dismiss the @entity11 's objections			1
lord justice @entity30 said @entity8 was decaying fast and had been largely unoccupied since the 1990s			2
he added that ' everyone now agrees it must be sold - what is in dispute is the process by which the sale should be achieved '			2
the judge said the trustees of the @entity25 were seeking approval ' for their momentous decision ' to sell @entity8 to an unnamed buyer , known only as mr a , for £ 11.25m			1
they said the sale price was ' a good one that represents an opportunity not to be missed '			0
but the @entity11 , 60 , said the price was ' inadequate			0
' he had wanted the trustees removed ' broadly on the grounds that they are unfit to act '			0
after an earlier hearing at the @entity52 , the @entity11 said that once the case was over he would ' turn my hand to finding another hotelier who wants to make @entity8 a very elegant hotel that befits the building '			2
the @entity11 , pictured with his second wife @entity59 , @entity59 , said the £ 11.25m sale price was ' inadequate ' the trustees , @entity62 , a barrister ’s clerk , and @entity65 , an accountant , were appointed by the @entity11 when he moved to @entity66 for four years			1
but when he returned they refused to give up control of the estate , leading him to take legal action			0
the bitter dispute that followed has seen the trustees make at least 14 criminal allegations against him , ranging from damaging pheasant feeders to spitting at them , although none of the charges resulted in a conviction			0
last year , property tycoon @entity79 was reportedly in discussions with the trustees to buy the @entity84 - listed , 19th @entity83 mansion .			0
