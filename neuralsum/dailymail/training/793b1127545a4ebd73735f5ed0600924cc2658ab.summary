his family claim he is @entity9 because his father has been granted @entity9 citizenship			1
he is being held with @entity16 because the authorities claim he is a muslim and will not release him into the care of a @entity10 @entity16 has spent the past four months shackled to the floor in a disease - ridden jail after being sentenced to death by hanging earlier this month for converting from @entity38 to @entity39 and marrying a @entity10 man			1
her lawyer @entity41 said the couple are ' happy and proud ' of their new arrival and that it has brought a momentary ray of light to an otherwise bleak and desperate situation			0
mr @entity41 : ' this is a special moment for them			0
@entity13 is delighted that he is able to see his new daughter so soon			1
' the family are taking some time to enjoy the birth before they return to fighting the injustice of @entity16 's sentence			1
' @entity13 , a 27 - year - old biochemist who lives in @entity22 , @entity23 , also got the chance to hold his 20 - month - old son @entity26 , who is being held in the barbaric prison with his mother			1
the photo is especially poignant as @entity16 will never see her beautiful daughter grow up			1
she is set to hang sometime in the next two years as the authorities said she will be executed when she has finished weaning @entity63			0
and before the birth , @entity16 made the defiant claim that she would rather die than give up her faith			1
in a heart - wrenching conversation with her husband during a rare prison visit , @entity16 told him : ' if they want to execute me then they should go ahead and do it because i ’m not going to change my faith			1
’ loving : @entity16 and @entity13 married in @entity7			1
@entity13 left @entity23 to visit her in @entity7 and arrange for his wife and son to join him in @entity9 when she was arrested holding out hope : @entity13 outside his home in @entity21 , @entity7 , as he awaits the fate of his wife who has been held in shackles in prison			1
she has told him that she would rather die than change her faith an @entity38 @entity87 judge said she could be spared the death penalty if she publicly renounced her faith and becomes a @entity89 once more			1
@entity16 insists she has always been a @entity10 and told her husband she could not ' pretend to be a muslim ' just to spare her life			1
she told him : ' i refuse to change			0
i am not giving up @entity39 just so that i can live			1
' i know i could stay alive by becoming a muslim and i would be able to look after our family , but i need to be true to myself			0
’ @entity13 revealed his wife ’s defiant stance during an exclusive interview with @entity99 at his modest home in the @entity102 capital , @entity21			1
sitting beneath glamorous photographs of his wife taken at their wedding in december 2011 , he said : ' my wife is very , very strong			0
she is stronger than me			0
' when they sentenced her to death i broke down and tears were streaming down my eyes			2
our lawyers were passing me tissues			0
' she did not flinch when she was sentenced			0
it was amazing to see , particularly because she is the one facing the death penalty			0
’ @entity13 was in @entity21 trying to arrange for @entity118 and their 20 - month - old son , @entity26 , to live with him in the @entity9 when his wife was arrested in september			1
she was three weeks pregnant with their second child			0
the authorities will not release @entity26 into the care of his father			0
bleak : the @entity127 in @entity21 , @entity7 where @entity16 is being held			1
it is overcrowded and riven with disease @entity16 has been locked up in the notorious women 's prison in @entity21 since september after being charged with adultery and apostasy and given the death sentence she spends much of her time shackled to the floor , is not receiving much nutrition in her food and is rarely allowed outside			1
both she and her bewildered son have contracted various illnesses because of the poor sanitation at the jail			0
a report by @entity144 claims the prison is ' beset with overcrowding ’ and suffers from ' poor sanitation , disease and the deaths of many children living with their mothers ’			0
@entity13 , who is originally from @entity7 , but is now a naturalized @entity9 , was initially refused permission to visit her			1
@entity13 told @entity99 : ' they say the marriage is void			1
now , even my wife is no longer my wife			0
and my son is not mine and my new daughter is not mine			0
they say i am a stranger to them			0
' i know my wife puts on a brave face but i can tell that she is in quite a bit of pain			0
she does n’t get to leave the room for weeks			0
' she has suffered medical complications while in jail , but no one knows the full extent of what they are because she is in prison			0
it ’s a difficult time			0
to see her walking in chains is difficult			0
’ @entity13 , who is wheelchair - bound because he suffers from muscular dystrophy , cuts a forlorn figure as he wheels himself around his empty house			2
his child ’s bed lies unused , as does a child - sized toothbrush			0
@entity13 keeps himself busy by studying the regular barrage of paperwork that his legal team send him			2
like many in @entity7 , both @entity13 and his wife ’s childhood were blighted by civil war			2
@entity13 managed to escape the brutal conflict in 1998 when he travelled to @entity9 with his brother @entity191			1
the biochemist returned to @entity7 to marry @entity16 at a @entity10 service in a chapel which was attended by around 500 people in december 2011			1
most who were at the wedding ceremony could vouch for the pair being committed @entity10 , defence lawyers say			2
rotten care : @entity26 is given a drink by prison guards			0
@entity13 is desperate to be allowed to take him home and is fiercely critical of the @entity9 embassy for failing to help them and @entity26 in particular , who is @entity9 but witnesses who were willing to give evidence on her behalf were barred from testifying because they were @entity10			1
she even produced a marriage certificate identifying herself as a @entity10			2
despite this , the judge determined that because her father was a muslim , even though he abandoned the family while they were living in a refugee camp in the @entity218 when she was six , she too was a muslim who had broken the law by leaving @entity38			1
but her mother , who is now dead , brought her up as @entity10			2
her mother was born in @entity223 to @entity10 parents , but fled to @entity7 because of famine , and chose to raise her daughter in the same religion			2
@entity16 was arrested in mid-september , three weeks after her second child was conceived			2
at first the couple dismissed the allegations against them as trivial , but when the case grew more serious @entity13 went to the @entity233 in @entity21 for help			1
' i thought this would be the one place which would help me , but they told me they did n’t have time to do anything , ’ @entity13 said			1
' i was upset because now that i am @entity9 citizen i thought they would help me			1
they said “ well your wife is n’t @entity9 , so we ca n’t help ”			2
my home is in @entity9 and still they wo n’t help			2
it ’s getting uglier and it ’s not going in the right direction			0
’ mr @entity13 said the @entity251 asked him to provide dna evidence proving that @entity26 was his biological son			2
he added : ' i have provided wedding documents and the baby ’s birth certificate , but this is clearly not enough			2
it ’s very upsetting that they do n’t believe me			0
' they want me to take a dna sample in @entity21 , then send it to the @entity9 for testing			1
it ’s as if they do n’t believe a word i say			0
’ the @entity87 court has postponed her sentence , to give her time to recover from childbirth and to wean the new baby			2
her lawyer , @entity41 , a muslim , has received death threats for defending her but has already lodged an appeal			2
if he does not succeed at the @entity276 , he will take the case to @entity7 ’s @entity278			0
fighting for justice : the legal team from the justice centre in @entity7 trying to free @entity16 includes ( l to r ) @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 mr @entity41 said the case hinges around the testimony of two men who claim to be her brothers , and one woman who claims to be her mother			2
in court they claimed that she had disappeared from the family home in a small village in the east of @entity7 and then discovered her living in @entity21 , married to a @entity10 man			1
but the lawyer said all three witnesses are liars whose evidence to the court has been highly contradictory			0
he suggested that the trio are making up their story in an attempt to claim ownership of @entity118 ’s flourishing general store in a shopping mall on the outskirts of @entity21			0
mr @entity41 added : ' we can prove that @entity16 ’s mother died in 2012 and that the two others are definite fraudsters			0
but the court is not interested in our evidence			0
