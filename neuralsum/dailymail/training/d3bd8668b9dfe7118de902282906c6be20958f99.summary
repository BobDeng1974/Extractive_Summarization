a £ 15 million wooden chemistry laboratory will continue to burn for a further 24 hours , firefighters confirmed today			1
the @entity2 at @entity3 was destroyed after it several fires broke out inside the state - of - the - art building on friday night			1
the laboratory , which was part - funded by a £ 12 million grant from pharmaceutical company @entity9 was due to open for the first time next year			1
@entity27 , who was the incident commander from @entity23 , said : ' no other buildings have been affected , fortunately no people were involved in this fire and we 've had 12 crews here , that 's over 60 firefighters			1
' credit to those firefighters who pulled out all the stops to prevent this fire spreading			1
' when we arrived , the fire was a significant size - it could be seen from quite a distance - and there was a smoke plume spreading towards the campus area so we sent out a message for people to keep doors and windows closed			1
' the firefighters have worked hard to contain that fire and stop it from spreading to any other buildings			1
' members of the public might have been quite alarmed when they heard a loud bang that some thought was an explosion - that 's something that happens to buildings when they 're exposed to extreme heat and pressure but that 's a risk that we manage and are trained to deal with			0
' fire officers remained on the scene today to continue spraying water at that the remains of the building which was completely destroyed by last night 's fire @entity23 deployed 60 firefighters from 8.30pm last night to battle the blaze and stop it from spreading to adjacent buildings @entity3 registrar dr @entity69 admitted the fire was a massive setback but said the college would rebuild the chemistry laboratory eyewitnesses reported seeing the bright orange flames from as far as seven miles away			1

' we would like to thank the wider higher education community across the @entity117 for its support - we have had many offers of help from other universities around the country , for which we are extremely grateful			0

' battle : some 60 firefighters were at the university site , which had been due to open next month			1
onlookers reported hearing the sound of several explosions inferno : the huge fire - which has devastated the building - could be seen for several miles around			1
thousands study on the @entity139 each day the building was designed to reach carbon neutral status in 25 years to make up the energy expended during its construction			1
mr @entity69 added : ' this is a setback for us but one from which we have no doubt we will recover			1
' the @entity148 is a landmark building which is the embodiment of the @entity3 's commitment to sustainability in all its forms , particularly in the area of green chemistry and we will be working closely with our partners at @entity9 , and the contractors @entity157 , to develop a positive plan of action for rebuilding			1

i got here about 3am			0
the first responsibility was to check all the peripheral buildings			0
' we 're now at the stage where we 're can go in there and help with the situation			0
' because it 's a timber base , four or five secondary fires were around the scene			0
there were 12 fire engines and an average of five firefighters per engine			1
' we 're now trying to ramp it up and going in aggressively and get into the fire site			2
it will be at least 24 or 26 hours before we can make that massive difference			2
' the investigation will follow			2
it 's not safe enough to go in there yet			0

' we are supporting the fire service investigation into the cause of the incident and thank its officers for their efforts last night to tackle and contain the blaze			1
' residents living near the university campus have also reacted in shock after flames ripped through the new science building			1

i hope it was n't deliberate			0

all the workers , all those jobs and money - it 's a shame			0

the @entity2 at @entity3 caught fire at 8.30pm friday
the £ 15million wooden structure has been completely destroyed in the blaze which needed 60 firefighters to control
@entity3 held an open day for *prospective* *undergraduates* today despite the fire continuing to blaze
@entity23 said they expected the fire would continue for at least another 24 hours
an investigation into the cause of the blaze has not yet started as the building is still too dangerous to examine
university registrar dr @entity69 said the college would be working with its partners to rebuild the structure
at the height of the blaze people could see the flames from seven miles away across the city
