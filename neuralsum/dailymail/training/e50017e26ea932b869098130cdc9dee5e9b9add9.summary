@entity2 's economy grew much less than predicted last , the @entity0 warned today			1
the global finance watchdog now thinks growth of just 2.6 per cent was achieved in 2014 , compared to a previous forecast of 3.2 per cent			1
the @entity0 said that apart from in the @entity8 , the economic performance of all major economies had fallen short of expectations			1
the @entity0 has estimated that gross domestic product in @entity2 grew by 2.6 per cent in 2014 compared to a previous forecast of 3.2 per cent it also appeared to back further stimulus measures that look likely to be unveiled in the eurozone this week			1
the sharp downgrade comes just days after the @entity0 heartily endorsed @entity2 's economic strategy			1
director @entity16 said the @entity2 was setting a global example and said in much of the world growth was ' too low , too fragile '			2
the @entity0 still expects the @entity2 to grow by 2.7 per cent this year while it has cut its forecast for 2016 by 0.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent			1
growth of 2.6 per cent in 2014 would come in ahead of major international rivals such as the @entity8 , according to the projections			2
but the lower than previously predicted figure comes after official @entity2 data last month showed the economy had grown less strongly than had been thought between the third quarter of 2013 and the same period in 2014 - by 2.6 per cent rather than 3 per cent			1
chancellor @entity27 said : ' today 's @entity0 forecast show @entity2 is pulling ahead , while global growth is being downgraded			1
there 's confirmation that we grew faster than any other major economy last year , and we 're set to grow faster this year			0
' but there are risks out there in the global economy			0
it 's a timely reminder of that and we 've got to go on working through our long - term economic plan if we want to stay ahead			0
' chancellor @entity27 said the @entity0 forecast shows ' @entity2 is pulling ahead ' gdp figures for the fourth quarter completing the picture will be published next week by the @entity44 ( @entity44 )			1
in today 's report published in @entity46 , the @entity0 said it that it had cut its forecast for global growth this year by 0.3 per cent for this year and next , to 3.5 per cent for 2015 and 3.7 per cent for 2016			2
it said that while the world would receive a boost from lower oil prices , this would be ' more than offset by negative factors ' including investment weakness amid falling expectations about medium term growth in many advanced and developing states			0
the @entity0 said the downward revisions reflected prospects in @entity60 , @entity61 , the eurozone and @entity63 - with stagnation and low inflation a concern in the latter two			0
there had also been as weaker activity in some major oil exporters - with oil prices having dropped by more than half since september			0
the @entity0 said : ' the boost from lower oil prices is expected to be more than offset by an adjustment to lower medium - term growth in most major economies other than the @entity8			2
' in the @entity2 , a new forecast by the @entity76 predicts that the lower oil price will provide a ' shot in the spending arm ' of consumers helping the economy to a major growth spurt this year			1
@entity83 governor @entity82 has said the fall in the oil price is a net positive for growth in the @entity2 but that it will represent a ' negative shock ' to the @entity89 economy which relies on @entity91 reserves			2
oil giant @entity92 has already announced hundreds of job cuts			0
the @entity0 report comes days before a @entity96 meeting which is expected to see a launch of money - printing quantitative easing stimulus to try to revive the ailing single currency zone			2
@entity100 ( left ) , director of the @entity0 , gave a glowing endorsement of the @entity2 economy on friday it appeared to give backing to the move , saying that while the boost to demand for struggling advanced countries was welcome , ' additional policy measures are needed in some economies '			1
@entity111 's @entity110 said : ' it 's worrying that the @entity0 has downgraded its forecasts for the @entity2 economy for last year and next year too			1
' in contrast the @entity0 says the @entity8 will grow faster than us this year and next year and has seen its growth forecasts upgraded			0
' this shows why the complacency of @entity119 and @entity27 is so misplaced			0
claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow to millions of working people who are on average Â£ 1600 a year worse off under this government			0
' we need stronger and more balanced growth that delivers sustained rises in living standards for all , not just a few			0
that 's what @entity111 's economic plan is all about			0
