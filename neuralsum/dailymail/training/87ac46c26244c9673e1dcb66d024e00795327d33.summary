letting them go : @entity1 spokeswoman @entity6 said monday that the airline hopes that at least 2,100 of its 23,000 flight attendants will accept an offer that could be worth as much as $ 100,000 while some 1,450 were still on unpaid leave for the company this month , @entity1 said monday that it now is recalling all of its attendants so they may apply for the separation payment or return to work			1
the @entity25 , which represents @entity1 's stewards , lauded the high - paying severance as ' virtually unprecedented in the airline industry			1
' @entity1 's cooperation with @entity25 bodes well for contract negotiations that have been going on since the carrier merged with @entity32 in 2010			2
the relative seniority of each carrier 's flight attendants has yet to be determined , and despite a single operating certificate , @entity1 and @entity32 stewards have not yet integrated			2
' recalling furloughed flight attendants and aligning our staffing to match our flying schedule will further facilitate the company and @entity25 reaching a joint collective bargaining agreement , ' said @entity44 , @entity1 's executive vice president for human resources and labor relations , in a statement			1
' it 's another positive step in what has become a productive relationship with @entity25			0
