@entity1 's own goal set the tone for @entity3 's day at @entity4 's			1
it was the first slither of humiliation on a day that @entity7 will want to sweep under the rug as @entity9 won 8 - 0 against a club that traveled 653.4 miles to be torn apart			1
@entity1 's strike into the bottom - right corner of his own net and disastrous defending thereafter saw the 26 - year - old receive one - and - a - half out of 10 in @entity16 's ratings			1
luckily for the man on loan from @entity19 , he 's not alone			2
@entity20 , @entity21 and more have all been there as @entity16 dig out the best own goals of all time			1
@entity9 's @entity25 and @entity26 celebrate as @entity3 's @entity1 ( right ) looks on @entity1 picks the ball from the net behind goalkeeper @entity29 as @entity3 went on to lose 8 - 0 @entity29 and @entity1 of @entity3 look disappointed as @entity9 ran riot at @entity4 's on saturday @entity20 ( @entity31 vs @entity32 , 2013 ) @entity20 uncharacteristically sliced a clearance which looped over helpless goalkeeper @entity34			1
it struck the post - as did @entity37 while trying to prevent the own goal - and @entity20 was left red - faced by the gaffe that brought @entity32 level at @entity41			1
not to worry , though , as @entity31 went on to win the game 4 - 2 and eventually the @entity44 title			2
@entity20 uncharacteristically sliced a clearance which looped over helpless goalkeeper @entity34 @entity37 hits the post in a bid to prevent @entity20 's own goal but the @entity31 captain was left embarrassed @entity50 ( @entity51 vs @entity52 , 1989 ) lobbing the goalkeeper from 25 yards is usually something you 'd be telling your grandchildren about for years			1
unfortunately for @entity50 , this clip has stood the test of time just as well			0
with a back - pass the only option left for @entity50 , the @entity61 international accidentally plays a deft volley perfectly over @entity64			2
@entity51 won the game 4 - 3 over their @entity67 rivals			1
@entity69 ( @entity70 vs @entity71 , 2002 ) it may not surprise you that @entity69 makes our list of greatest own goals and arguably his best came against @entity70 , although the cameraman was n't expecting it			2
@entity69 tells it best when asked which own goal he was most embarrassed about			0
the now 42 - year - old manager of @entity82 says : ' probably the one against @entity70			0
@entity83 was @entity71 's goalkeeper and i tried to hit a backpass from about 35 yards			0
' but i slipped and it went in			0
that was the most painful one because we ended up going down that year			0
' @entity71 's @entity69 walks with his head down after scoring an own goal against @entity70 @entity71 striker @entity91 ( left ) consoles @entity69 after an own goal in the @entity44 @entity93 ( @entity95 vs @entity51 , 2004 ) @entity51 were eventually relegated by a single point on the last day of the season in 2004 - 05 , and @entity93 's own goal against @entity95 at @entity99 did n't help matters			1
trailing 2 - 1 in a rain - soaked @entity95 , the @entity102 defender put the game out of reach with a majestic flick into the back of his own net			0
a pupil of @entity109 , @entity93 somehow got the ball into the top corner from a cross and it went down as one of the ' most beautiful ' goals of all time			0
@entity93 ( left ) of @entity51 holds his head in his hands and made the gaffe against @entity119 @entity120 ( @entity31 vs @entity121 , 2003 ) their invincible season had it all			0
goals , glamour and glitz on their way to @entity44 title glory			0
this own goal by @entity120 , however , was a momentary lapse during an otherwise flawless season			0
under pressure from @entity136 's blistering pace , the defender takes a touch 30 yards from goal towards goalkeeper @entity139 , and slots it beyond the @entity141 to make it 1 - 0			1
@entity121 won 2 - 1			1
@entity120 's own goal against @entity31 in 2003 was a bump in the road during their incredible season @entity147 ( @entity121 vs @entity148 , 1991 ) safety first			1
that 's the defender 's mantra , but @entity147 regrets opting for a back - pass this time			1
@entity147 , with the ball 30 yards from goal , decides to loft it back to @entity157 with too much venom and it sails over the @entity161 international			0
@entity162 on @entity163 made it their regular go - to clip whenever @entity147 featured			0
@entity147 of @entity121 looks dejected and his own goal that lobbed @entity157 went down in history @entity21 ( @entity168 vs @entity169 , 2002 ) did he touch the ball ? that 's the big question			1
either way , it goes down as one of the most bizarre own goals of all time by @entity169 goalkeeper @entity21			1
@entity168 met their bitter rivals @entity169 for the first time in a decade , and nobody expected a 3 - 0 win for the club who were so often in the shadow of the other			1
@entity186 's throw - in to @entity21 went under the goalkeeper 's foot and into the net			1
as if that was n't bad enough , a few fans took to the pitch to boast , too			0
@entity193 ( @entity194 vs @entity195 , 2006 ) a straight - forward clearance proved anything but for @entity193			0
with the ball bouncing , the former @entity199 manager swiped to clear the ball from behind , only to have it cannon off his face and into the back of his own net			0
@entity206 in goal could do nothing			0
@entity195 came back to win 3 - 2 but @entity193 's nose - and ego - took a severe beating that day			2
@entity210 ( @entity211 vs @entity212 , 2005 ) he did n't often score winners during his seven - year spell at @entity212 , and @entity210 is mainly remembered for this own goal against @entity211			2
anyone who tries to replicate a @entity218 drag - back in the six - yard box runs the risk of being punished , and @entity210 learned that the hard way in 2005			0
@entity212 lost 1 - 0 at @entity222 side @entity211 and were knocked out of the @entity223			1
@entity212 's @entity210 knocks the ball into his own net watched by goalkeeper @entity226 @entity210 reacts after his gaffe against @entity211 as @entity212 were knocked out of the @entity223 third round @entity210 finds himself in the net after replicating a @entity218 drag - back in the six - yard box @entity232 ( @entity231 vs @entity233 , 2000 ) all @entity232 had to do was coolly clear the danger			2
instead , he found the top - right corner			2
you 're forgiven if you had n't heard of the @entity231 defender before , but this @entity223 blunder helped cement @entity232 's place in own goal history			2
seemingly under no pressure , @entity232 tries to swipe the ball to safety but slices it into his own net .			0

@entity1 's own goal was first of eight strikes against @entity3
