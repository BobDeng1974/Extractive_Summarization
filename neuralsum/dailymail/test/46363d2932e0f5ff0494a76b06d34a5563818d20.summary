it may look like @entity1 in the trailer , but the droid that will join @entity4 in the forthcoming @entity7 film - @entity5 - is very much real			1
the robot , named @entity9 , took to the stage at @entity12 convention in @entity13 , @entity14 , where it literally ran rings around the retro droid on its spherical body			1
@entity18 , the film ’s director , confirmed that a real robot was used during filming , but did not reveal how it works			1
’ @entity40 , a teenager from @entity41 said : ‘ # @entity34 is one of the few things in life that makes me want to understand engineering , while video editor @entity46 tweeted : ‘ this is the part of the # @entity7 event today that really blew my mind			0
# @entity34 is not cgi			0
@entity52 ’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction , but it also has a completely free - moving head that does n’t fall off , leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works			2
speaking about filming the movie , @entity18 said : ' there were a lot of discussions about how having a @entity1 bb - 8 could be so much easier for shooting			1
@entity18 , the film ’s director , confirmed that a real robot was used during filming , instead of @entity1 , but did not reveal how the robot worked			1
here , @entity9 the rolling droid @entity25 is spotted inside the @entity70 , peeking around a corner from today , @entity7 fans will be able to tweet using new emojis exclusive to the social network			1
three emojiis have been introduced showing @entity76 , a storm trooper and a new droid			2
they have been rolled out in anticipation of the release of @entity7 : @entity82 @entity83			0
to tweet a @entity7 emoji , users must include hastags : # @entity76 , # @entity87 or # @entity34 which will be transformed into little cartoons			2
‘ but we talked originally about it would be better for the film , for the actors , for the sets and the look of it if it were performed			0
’ he confirmed that @entity25 was ‘ built and puppeteered ’ in the film , but no strings were visible when the beeping , chirping droid rolled on stage , leading experts to speculate that it must be controlled by at least one remote control			1
the robot ’s body is likely to be a large robotic ball , like a big version of the @entity110 , @entity105 ’s @entity104 speculated			1
the toy by @entity112 is controlled by a smartphone app using a @entity115 connection and allows users to make it go in any direction – much like the new droid			0
@entity52 ’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction ( pictured ) but it also has a completely free - moving head that does n’t fall off , leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works the robot ’s body is likely to be a large remote - controlled robotic ball , like a big version of the @entity110 ( pictured )			1
the toy by @entity112 is controlled by a smartphone app using a @entity115 connection and allows users to make it go in any direction – much like the new droid professor @entity136 , a @entity137 in @entity138 , told @entity139 that the walking globe is easy to achieve – ‘ we could build one if we had the budget ’			0
‘ it ’s related to the default egg - race - style self - propelled double wheel device or the walk - in - balloon which anyone can try , ’ he said , referring to a zorb , which humans walk inside and push against the side to move along			0
but the real mystery is how the robot ’s head can move independently but stay on top of the free - rolling ball			1
it ’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘ stick ’ the droid ’s head to its body , but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it ’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness			1
it could be that the droid ’s head is a separate robot with its own set of remote controls , enabling it to ‘ look ’ around			2
it 's currently a mystery as to how @entity9 moves , but its white and orange case may hide a larger mechanism like that found in @entity110 , which allows it to move quickly in any direction			2
the real question is how its head stays on @entity52 ’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction , but it also has a completely free - moving head that does n’t fall off , leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works			1
this image shows the robot on the set of the film , which will be released in the @entity198 in december it may be able to stay upright easily by depending on a gyroscope that tells it which way is up and use an accelerometer to monitor motion , much like many smartphone games			2
magnets may still be used to keep the head in contact with the body			0
professor @entity136 said : ‘ the floating ‘ head ’ is probably on rollers magnetically bound through the plastic ball to the " driving " robot inside			2
’ he explained that rare earth magnets are very strong and light and the robot ’s ‘ movements are consistent with this , such as a tendency to move in the direction of travel			0
’ ‘ the inside and head could be wirelessly linked but given that this robot is radio controlled rather than autonomous … i suspect that head and body are just independently radio controlled			0
’ it ’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘ stick ’ the droid ’s head to its body ( pictured ) , but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it ’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness from today , @entity7 fans will be able to tweet using new emojis ( pictured ) exclusive to the social network @entity110 is the world 's first robotic toy ball that 's controlled by a smartphone app. it 's been suggested that @entity25 may use similar technology in its body			1
the @entity110 toy can be programmed to weave in between objects , follow augmented reality race tracks and even keep a pet entertained			0
the 2.8 - inch ( 73mm ) ball travels up to 5mph ( 0.6 km / h ) , is fully waterproof and costs $ 99.99 in the @entity257 , and £ 99.99 in the @entity198			0
@entity110 ( pictured ) is the world 's first robotic toy ball that 's controlled by a smartphone app the gadget weighs 178g ( 0.4lbs ) and has a gyroscope and accelerometer inside that connect to a tablet or smartphone via @entity115 , as well as two rubber wheels			1
a counterweight gets the ball rolling on demand and sensors allow users to control the direction and speed of the ball			0
the wheels inside work like a hamster running inside a ball and never leave @entity110 's surface , so it can turn corners at high speed			2
there are up to 30 games available via apps including driving , sports and arcade games , and the polycarbonate ball could soon be on its way to school classrooms to give children an insight into robotics			0
it is hoped the waterproof ball will inspire a future generation to get involved in computer science and design and technology .			0

@entity25 moved in all directions on stage at @entity12 in @entity13
director @entity18 said a real robot and not @entity1 was used in the film
@entity307 were *mesmerised* by the droid but it 's a mystery how it works
suggestions include giant robotic ball has another magnetic robot on top
