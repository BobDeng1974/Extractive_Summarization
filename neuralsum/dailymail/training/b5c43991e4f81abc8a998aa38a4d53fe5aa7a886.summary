by @entity0 at @entity1 there is one word to sum up @entity4 , and it 's an obvious one , given that it 's his favourite : fabulous			1
and that , as ever , is the best way to describe the @entity10 designer 's catwalk show			1
this is a man , after all , who has crystal balls in his kitchen and wears gold kaftans to @entity16 ( probably )			0
his show today was a feast of glitter and glamour : gold gowns sprinkled with shimmering paillettes ; chiffon dresses in palest oyster with sparkling silver mesh ; backless pieces with sweeping trains and sheer cut - out sections revealing a glimpse of ( beglittered ) skin beneath			1
' the people who buy my clothes do n't worry about money , ' he said			0
' they buy the best , they love diamonds , jewellery			0
' centre : stand out : the leotard @entity46 was eyeing up , saying , ' it would look amazing in a music video '			1
right : the collection was incredibly intricate and had taken hours to finesse hard work : welsh designer @entity4 says creating a collection is ' painful ' - with hours of embroidery and sewing on beads - but the results are stunning feminine : inspiration came during a friend 's 40th birthday party in @entity61 , where @entity4 says he dressed in gold kaftan , gold slippers and wandered through the @entity64 , disregarding the laughter			1
' i 'm on my holidays , and if i want to wear a gold kaftan i will , ' he said today spectacular : delicate lace and shimmering embellishment on chiffon were the order of the day i loved a silver gown with crackled mirror finish ; a long - sleeved , space - age sequin beauty with centre split and a chiffon dress with intricate blue and silver embroidery that looked to have been stitched by elves			2
@entity46 , who sat front row , loved a rather daring leotard made of nothing more than chiffon and some judiciously placed beads and sequins			2
' it 'd be amazing for a music video , ' she said			0
@entity89 , wearing @entity4 , said the entire show was ' amazing ' , but in particular she adored a long black macro-crochet dress			1
' but if i go out in it i 'll definitely wear underwear , ' she says			0
after the show , which also saw @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity46 and @entity99 perch front row in @entity101 designs , @entity4 said the show was inspired by a recent trip to @entity104			1
' we all went to @entity61 for my friend 's 40th birthday party , ' he says , holding court among his @entity110 pals - none of whom can rival him in the body glitter stakes			1
' i was so inspired by the colours , the textiles , the flowers , the femininity			0
' but i was even more inspired in the evening when people went home and changed into the most glamorous outfits they wanted and they partied the night away under a very exotic sky			0
' @entity120 : a red carpet ready dress on the runway exotic : @entity4 says he was inspired by a trip to @entity104 @entity126 : the fairytale collection included lashings of silver mesh ' fabulous ' : @entity89 said from the @entity130 that this black crochet dress was her favourite - but she 'd be wearing it with underwear - while right , metallic embroidery elevated gowns into the spectacular recession proof : @entity4 says his customers are the sort who buy diamonds - they 're not phased by the poor economy make - up , by @entity142 , was ethereal , like a tribe of exotic fairies on a big night @entity147 ' skin dazzled with a layer of gold glitter , their hair ( by @entity151 at @entity152 ) slicked back			1
shoes were by @entity154 ( models were slipping on sliding on the @entity157 floor : ' whatever ! they looked fab - u - lous ' , said @entity4 afterwards )			1
@entity4 , being @entity4 , wore a showstopper , of course			2
' i was actually wearing - you 're going to love this - a gold kaftan , with a gold belt , a gold @entity104 slipper , and a little pochette			2
' and i walked through the @entity64 to my friend 's birthday party			2
they all thought i was mad and everybody laughed at me			0
' but i thought , you know what ? i do n't care			0
i 'm on my holidays , i 'm in @entity104			0
if i want to wear a gold kaftan ... and i did actually wear a gold kaftan			0
' so when can the rest of us get away with wearing showstoppers like @entity4 's ? ' you know what ? ' he says with typical enthusiasm			1
' any time , any place , anywhere			0
just have fun with fashion , enjoy it			0
enjoy yourself and be a woman			0
so what ? ' for @entity4 though , while he may be the very embodiment of mischievous devil - may - care once the work is done , nothing about the planning for his show is ' so what '			1
the preparation and backbreaking work that goes into creating such an extravagant show is no mean feat. indeed , @entity4 has one word for it : pain			1
' it 's a painful , arduous task of embroidery and sewing , ' he laughs			2
' it is a total nightmare that looks like a total dream at the end			0
it 's a lot of hard work			2
we were doing the hair and make - up test in my kitchen at half past four this morning			1
' in the end i was like , " guys , it 's half past four , i 'll see you at the venue tomorrow			2
if it 's not working , we 'll start all over again			0
" ' take a bow : @entity4 enjoys the applause at the end of his enjoyable ( and incredibly glamorous ) show the @entity130 : model @entity89 , actress @entity226 , and singers @entity95 and @entity96			1

one of @entity1 's *highlights* , @entity4 showed at @entity231 's @entity230
preparing for show is ' arduous ' - was up till *4.30am* testing make - up
as always , s / @entity237 collection was a feast of glitter and glamour
@entity130 included @entity242 , @entity226 , @entity46 , @entity95
