a trainee teacher who suffered agonising cystitis for 17 years has managed to get her condition under control - by cutting out pizza and alcohol			1
@entity6 said for years she felt like she needed to go to the toilet 50 times a day - but urinating was like ' passing razor blades			1
' the now - 23 - year - old was bullied at school by children in primary school who told her she should ' wear a nappy ' as she ran for the loo			1
teachers thought she was making up her symptoms to get out of class and doctors did n't know what was wrong with her			2
at seven years old ( left ) , @entity6 , now 23 , began suffering pain and a frequent urge to urinate			1
as she got older ( right ) she began needing the loo 50 times a day , but said urinating was like ' passing razor blades ' in 2013 she was finally diagnosed with interstitial cystitis , a chronic form of the condition which does not respond to antibiotics and can be hard to treat but finally , it emerged she had the serious condition interstitial cystitis , which causes recurring pain , urgency , a need to pass water frequently and a burning sensation when passing urine			1
after reading leaflets about her condition she found a surprising cure : cutting out some of her favourite foods – including pizza and sweets			1
interstitial cystitis is triggered by inflammation of the bladder wall , which can follow childbirth , surgery or repeated bouts of bladder infections , though sometimes there is no known cause			1
while most cases of cystitis clear up on their own or with antibiotics , interstitial cystitis does not respond to the drugs and can turn into a painful long - term condition that is hard to treat			1
miss @entity6 , of @entity60 , chose to speak about her intimate problems to let other women suffering from the same illness know they were not alone			1
her problems started when she was in primary school , when she could barely sit through a lesson without feeling a desperate urge to urinate			0
she said : ' i had the burning sensation like you 're about to burst constantly			0
' it was nearly every day			2
interstitial cystitis causes recurring flare ups of discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area			1
like regular cystitis , @entity78 sufferers experience an urgency and frequent need to urinate			2
but the condition does n't respond to treatment with antibiotics , because it is not caused by a bacterial infection			2
around 400,000 people in the @entity87 suffer the condition			2
more than 90 per cent of these cases are in women			0
the condition is commonly diagnosed around the age of 40			1
what causes @entity78 ? researchers are not clear on the causes of the condition			2
there is a school of thought that believes the illness is inherited			0
it is also thought to be linked to other conditions including irritiable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia			0
another theory is that one of the protective layers of the bladder wall may ' leak ' in people with @entity78 , allowing chemicals in the urine to irritate the bladder			0
people with @entity78 often have small areas of scarring , stiffness or bleeding on the wall of their bladder			0
lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms it is possible to reduce the symptoms by making some lifestyle changes			2
how is @entity78 treated ? there is no single treatment , with each sufferer finding different therapies helpful			0
treatments include : source : @entity131 ' i got the urgent need to go to the loo , several times every lesson			1
' teachers would say no , thinking i was messing around			0
' i 'd do whatever i could to distract myself – cross my legs , drum my fingers on the desk , chew my pencil and bite my nails			0
' but the urge to go would just get too much and i would run for the door			0
other children would say , " you should wear a nappy "			0
' when she was seven , miss @entity6 's mother @entity148 , now 50 , took her to an urologist who failed to find anything wrong with her			1
' i thought it might be in my head , ' miss @entity6 said			1
' as i got older , i tried cutting down on the amount i was drinking , but it did n't help			2
' i was still dashing for the toilet 50 times a day			1
even after i 'd been , i 'd feel a burning desire to go again fewer than five minutes later			0
' it was excruciating though and felt like weeing razor blades			0
' as she got older , she said she would spend nights out clubbing with her friends queuing for the toilets instead of on the dancefloor			0
long car journeys also filled her with dread			0
in 2013 she was finally diagnosed with the chronic bladder condition interstitial cystitis , for which there is no known cure			1
while it 's more common in women over 40 , it can affect younger women , too			0
miss @entity6 said the diagnosis brought little relief because she had hoped doctors would be able to help her			1
' it causes recurring and intense pain in the pelvic area , as well as an increased need to urinate , ' she said			0
' i knew i could n't live with it forever			0
' while there is no cure for the disease , making lifestyle changes is thought to help ease its symptoms			1
the @entity190 advises people with the condition to stop consuming caffeine , chocolate , carbonated beverages , citrus drinks , and foods with high levels of vitamin @entity199 spicy foods and artificial sweeteners can also aggravate the bladder , although the charity warns that specific combinations of foods and drinks will act as a different trigger for each person			1
miss @entity6 decided to try cutting out some of the recommended foods to see if her condition improved			1
she said : ' i cut out everything that could trigger a flare up including alcohol , spicy food , plus anything high in sugar or fat , like pizza			1
' these were all my favourite foods , but i was amazed to notice my condition improved			2
' i still needed to use the toilet more often than most people but i was n't sprinting off to the loo as much			2
' it became less painful to urinate			2
' she is still learning to live with the condition , and still has to plan long journeys and nights out			2
she said : ' when i have a flare up , i do have to dash to the ladies 50 times a day			1
miss @entity6 found cutting out pizza , spicy foods and alcohol allowed her to manage her symptoms			1
she said : ' these were all my favourite foods , but i was amazed to notice my condition improved ' ' i have to plan long journeys to make sure there are plenty of toilet breaks and when i go out with friends , i 'm always the sober one			2
' i 'm at college training to be a teacher , but realistically i do n't know if i 'll be able to do it as a job			0
' dashing to the loo every five minutes would be a nightmare			0
' other sufferers have had catheters fitted , or even had their bladder removed when no other treatment options have been successful			0
but for now , miss @entity6 believes cutting out trigger foods will allow her to live a near - normal life			1
' i 'm not ready to go that far just yet , ' she said			0
' for now , i 've accepted this is me			0
