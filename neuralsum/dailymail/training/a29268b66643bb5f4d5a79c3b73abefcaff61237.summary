by @entity0 if you dug these up in your garden , you probably would n’t think twice about throwing them away			2
but the unassuming objects are 4,000 - year - old @entity6 beads , and worth their weight in gold			1
unearthed from a prehistoric burial chest on @entity11 , they have been heralded as one of the most significant historical finds in more than a century			1
the beads are part of a range of @entity6 artefacts found in @entity11 that have been heralded as one of the most significant finds of the past 100 years the chest ’s well - preserved contents included human bones , teeth , textiles and intricate jewellery			1
@entity6 expert dr @entity27 , from @entity26 , said that the find was a ‘ seven or eight out of ten ’ on a scale where the ruins of @entity31 get a ten			2
@entity33 , senior archaeologist from @entity11 , described the haul as one of the most important discoveries since the 19th century			1
she said : ‘ this is an incredible find			2
we had no idea we could end up with something as astounding as human remains			0
‘ the amber beads probably came from the @entity43 – and meant they were long - distance trading 4,000 years ago			1
‘ these artefacts show @entity11 was n’t the isolated , hard - to - reach place we thought it was			1
' this has been fascinating to work on , but it ’s just one piece in a puzzle			0
the story is only part - told			0
' the burial chest full of cremated bones and jewellery dating back 4,000 years is excavated on @entity11 the archaeologists , who were funded by @entity56 , had simply hoped that the chest would offer some clues about the environment of times past			1
but its exceptionally well - preserved contents , including human bones , teeth , a basket and around 200 beads , may contain a wealth of information about life at the time			1
mrs @entity33 said : ‘ we lifted the cist lid and saw some red fur with bits of bone sticking out			0
we thought a fox might have died there			0
‘ but then a little black bead fell out and we realised it was something much more interesting			0
' and it looked like the fur had been wrapped around some remains , lying on the granite base of the cist			0
we wrapped it in cling film and took it to the laboratory			0
’ the number of beads is particularly exciting			1
as well as the amber beads , human remains and a woven basket or bag were found preserved in peat the collection of artefacts were found in a stone - built chest or ' cist ' in @entity11 ( pictured ) mrs @entity33 said : ‘ their presence could mean it was a high - status burial that you ’d normally see in @entity100 or @entity101			1
‘ there were a number of amber beads which probably came from the @entity43 - and that must have meant they were doing long - distance trading 4,000 years ago			1
’ the cist , measuring roughly 30in wide by 60in long , also contained a band of leather complete with tassels , believed to be some sort of clothing item			0
some wooden jewellery , believed to be ear studs , was also discovered			2
the findings follow the announcement by scientists at the @entity119 this month that the skeleton exhumed in september last year during an archaeological dig in a car park is that of @entity123 mrs @entity33 said : ‘ it is a very exciting time for archaeology			0
‘ we do n’t yet know the age or the sex of the person whose remains have been found , and we may not			2
but this mystery is unfolding			0
‘ to be a part of it has been truly amazing			0
’ the chest , which will be featured on @entity136 ’s regional tv programme @entity137 , also contained a decorated leather band and a woven basket .			2
