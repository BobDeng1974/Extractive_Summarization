it could be a really cool way to lose weight			0
research suggests that winter weather may help keep us thin			0
in what will be welcome news for those who ate a few too many mince pies , it seems that something as simple as standing outside without a coat on could help rolls of fat melt away			0
lost the coat ! something as simple as standing outside without a coat on could help rolls of fat melt away the troublesome white variety that we are all too familiar with soaks up extra calories and stores them in big bellies , love handles and saddlebag thighs			1
but adults also have a small amount of a second ‘ healthy fat ’			0
this brown fat specialises in burning off calories and generates heat as it does so			1
babies have the lots of brown fat to keep them warm and adults that have more brown fat are slimmer than those without			2
a spokesman for the @entity38 researchers said : ‘ those who over-indulged during the holidays may want to get a shot of cold air to kick - start some extra fat - burning activity for the new year			1
’ the theory is n’t to do with low temperatures speeding up metabolism , instead it hinges on the different properties of two types of body fat			1

the @entity65 , @entity67 researchers , showed protein called @entity69 to be key in turning ‘ bad ’ white fat into a fat that resembles the healthy brown stuff			1
with around 90 per cent of the fat in an adult ’s body of the unhealthy white variety , finding a way of browning it could have a big impact			2
importantly , cold temperatures ramp up production of the browning protein			0
and the more @entity69 there , is the more white fat is converted into calorie - burning brown fat			1
in one experiment , mice that were genetically engineered to make large amounts of @entity69 put on 30 per cent less weight than other creatures – despite feasting on fatty food			0
it is thought that while babies still need brown fat to keep them warm , the amount of brown fat in adults may have dropped in tandem with our cosy , centrally - heated modern lives			2
the researchers said : ‘ it has been noted that outdoor workers in northern @entity103 who are exposed to cold temperatures have a significant amount of brown fat when compared to same - aged indoor workers but overall the per centage of brown fats in adults is small compared to white fat			1
’ mice with high levels of the browning protein also found it easier to process sugar – something that should cut their odds of diabetes , the journal @entity119 reports			0
babies have lots of ' good ' brown fat to keep them warm and adults that have more brown fat are slimmer than those without researcher @entity128 said : ‘ @entity130 fat is active , using up calories to keep the body warm			1
it will burn fat , it will burn glucose			0
‘ the idea is that if we can harness this , we can try to use this in therapy for weight loss and diabetes			0
’ the research backs up the @entity142 , a slimming plan that includes advice such as starting each day with a glass of cold water , sleeping in a cool room and ending a shower with a bracing blast cold water			0
in future , it may be possible increase levels of the browning protein – and so brown fat - without the need to endure the cold			1
lead scientist @entity157 said : ‘ if you can somehow increase levels of this protein through drugs , you could have more brown fat and could possibly lose more weight even if eating the same amount of food			2
’ others say that low temperatures will only help us lose weight if we do n’t compensate for the calories burnt off by the new brown fat			2
lacking calories and miserable in the cold , it may be all too easy to reach for a bar of chocolate .			0
