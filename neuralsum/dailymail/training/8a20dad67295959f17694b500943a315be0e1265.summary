by @entity0 two @entity2 teachers are building a home made of @entity4 that 's as sturdy as bricks and could withstand the huffs and puffs of a @entity8			1
according to @entity10 and @entity11 of @entity12 , @entity2 , their 1,400 - square - foot house could survive winds of 200 mph			1
the entire project will cost less than $ 100,000 to build			1
a similar wood - frame house would cost $ 150,000 , they estimate			1
' we decided this is something we want to do , ' @entity17 told @entity20			0
' to one : help our environment , and two : to make it economically possible for all of us to afford housing			0
it 's safer , it 's more secure [ and ] you get better energy efficiency			0
' my wife and i are not contractors and we are not home builders at all and we can have these walls built in about a week , week and a half , ' he said			2
the home , of course , is n't made entirely of styrofoam			2
concrete is poured into the hollow styrofoam blocks and becomes the actual structure of the house			1
the outside of the blocks are coated with stuccos , waterproofing finishes , drywall or siding			2
the @entity73 plan to add a stone finish			0
before the styrofoam sandwich is made , however , the hollow blocks are stacked on top of each other like legos - teeth from the top of the block slide into slits at the bottom of another block			1
the @entity2 couple is working with @entity87 - based @entity86 , a supplier of styrofoam blocks for residential and commercial properties			1
cost - effective : the @entity73 plan on building the 1,400 - square - foot house for less than $ 100,000 and hope to finish in november the @entity91 said the fact that @entity86 is owned by disabled @entity94 veterans is another reason they sourced from them			1
the @entity73 may be on to something , too			0
the @entity4 is becoming an ever - more popular building material , @entity100 , a member of the @entity102 @entity101 , told the @entity103 earlier this year			1
insulated concrete foam -- @entity106 -- has been around for decades , but it 's still a phenomenon in the residential space , he said			0
one drawback , however , is the loss of space to the numerous layers of wall that go into supporting , decorating and protecting the styrofoam , according to architecture blog @entity116 , which explored the ' hidden costs ' of @entity106			0
hard to tell : this otherwise nondescript home in @entity120 was built with the same @entity4 system used by the @entity73 ' the disadvantage of this type of construction is the overall wall thickness ; @entity106 walls tend to be very thick , and total wall assemblies ( the structure plus interior finish and exterior cladding ) can be upwards of 14 inches thick , ' according to the blog			2
' it is easy to see that choosing @entity106 means giving up some interior space to the wall			0
' the @entity91 said they hope to open their doors in late november			0
' my wife and i , both of us teach , and we 're always telling our kids do something different , make a difference in something , " mr. @entity17 told @entity20 .			0

@entity10 and @entity11 of @entity12 , @entity2 say their 1,400 - square - foot - home will cost less than $ 100,000
concrete is poured inside the hollow @entity4 blocks for support
