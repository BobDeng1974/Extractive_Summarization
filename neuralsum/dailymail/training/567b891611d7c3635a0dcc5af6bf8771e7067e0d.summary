elsewhere , the unique dual frontal stereo speakers now feature built - in amplifiers that automatically pick out specific sections of music - such as the vocals , or the bass - and adjusts them individually to improve the playback and prevent distortion			0

the @entity1 ( @entity12 ) is being rolled out globally , staring in the @entity104 and online in the @entity106 today			1
it will then be available in @entity106 stores from 10 april			2
the exact release schedule for other countries has not been announced yet			0
the phone comes in three colours - @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			2
in the @entity104 , the phone is available on three for an upfront cost of £ 49 and a choice of four 24 - month price plans			1
these start at £ 38 a month for 600 minutes and @entity95 of data , up to £ 44 a month			0
@entity121 is said to have approached @entity1 when it originally began building its @entity123 range back in 2012 , but the @entity10 firm was too busy with its smartphones , such as the @entity1 ( @entity12 ) pictured , so @entity121 is believed to have teamed up with @entity126 instead @entity1 is also launching a range of cases for @entity129 ( @entity12 ) that react to touch gestures			1
these cases , pictured , will be available in seven colours including blue , left , black , right , and green			0
they have a dotted appearance on the front that shows basic details , including the time and weather , without the case being opened the handset will also be available from @entity142 in @entity143 and @entity113 online on the 26 march , and through @entity142 stores on the 27 march			1

' the @entity1 was a standout device , in terms of both hardware and software , and deserved many of the accolades it was awarded from customers and critics			2
' as much as this was a boost for @entity1 , it meant that any successors would have to live up to the hype and be significantly better			0
' @entity1 is selling the @entity1 ( @entity12 ) as the ' best just got better ' , and while that 's true for some of its features , other improvements feel marginal			1
' the duo camera is a nice feature , but did n't wow us			0
it was difficult to test the new sound options in the speakers during our brief hands - on , and we could n't test battery life			0
' the screen has been made larger , and this makes it slightly more difficult to use than its predecessor , but this is a minor flaw			0
' @entity1 has moved the touch buttons from the front of the handset and they are now software - based , again a minor flaw but will slow existing @entity1 users down			1
' the @entity10 firm has also removed the plastic strip seen in the casing of the one , and the one ( @entity12 ) is now made entirely of lightweight metal , this makes it feel more expensive than its predecessor , and noticeably so next to the likes of @entity199 's plastic @entity198			1
' the most impressive improvements are software - based			0
the advanced photo editing tools , including the new refocus options made possible with the addition of the rear - facing depth sensor , are great			1
they certainly give @entity209 's 1020 a run for its money			0
' the new touch gestures are a simple addition , but make a huge difference to how we used and interacted with the device			0
and the fact these gestures work with the new cases is even more impressive			0
' however , there is n't anything in this handset that makes it leap out as a must - have device			2
it may be that we 've been spoilt by the fingerprint scanners and tracking features of @entity226 and @entity199 devices , or it may be that @entity1 just wants to keep things simple - either way , the device feels too similar to the current @entity1 to justify paying an extra £ 549 for			1
' @entity230 customers on this plan also get 2 for 1 cinema tickets with @entity234 , and anyone who buys the handset before 10 april will also be offered a free return flight to select @entity159 destinations			0
it will also be available in select @entity241 stores for free , from £ 42 on @entity243 plans			0
these plans comes with unlimited calls and texts			0
the first 3000 customers to buy with @entity241 will also get a @entity247			0
feature wise , @entity1 has added advanced photo editing tools to the device that lets people easily refocus , and cut out and paste parts of images into other photos , for example			1
