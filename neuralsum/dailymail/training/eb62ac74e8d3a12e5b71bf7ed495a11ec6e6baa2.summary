@entity0 are strong favourites although it 's always dangerous to write off @entity2 ... but who 's got the better players ? @entity6 expert @entity5 has watched both teams several times during the tournament			1
here is his indispensable man - for - man analysis			1
he perfect physique for a goalkeeper and the game to go with it			2
easily the world ’s best goalkeeper with goalkeepers it ’s all in the mind , and though he did n’t play much for @entity37 last season he has looked solid			1
a hero in the shootout and will be full of confidence			0
glove affair : @entity43 was a penalty shootout hero but @entity0 's keeper sweeper has the edge you talk about strikers staying calm to score , but @entity12 has a calmness in his defending			1
he trusts he can make challenges and his tackle on @entity52 was the best - timed challenge i ’ve seen in the tournament			1
has taken his @entity57 form to @entity58 and done well			0
struggled slightly against @entity60 ’s @entity59 but showed his tough side to carry on after taking a bad blow to the face against @entity64			1
evenly matched : there is not much to choose between @entity12 ( @entity22 ) and @entity66 at right back no airs and graces about @entity69			0
he ’s brilliant in the air and , with two goals , is a threat from setpieces			2
has arrogance and confidence , too , which i like			0
he gets better protection than he does at @entity79 but he looks quicker and slicker than he did last season and thoroughly justifies his spot			0
see you soon ? @entity69 ( @entity22 ) and @entity83 could face each other in @entity85 next season @entity87 7/10 has played at right back but makes a far better centre half			1
adds genuine pace in the middle alongside @entity69 , is strong and also good with his distribution			0
solid centre back and with his extra speed he can help cover @entity83 so his partner does n’t get isolated			0
has just moved to @entity97 for six million euros , which seems a bargain			0
need for speed : both @entity101 and @entity87 have pace to support their defensive partners @entity105 6/10 typifies his team ’s ethic			2
not a high - profile name but a no - frills defender			2
i ’ve barely seen him put a foot wrong			0
efficient , intelligent and rarely beaten down his flank			0
bit of a mixed bag			0
very quick and obviously likes to get forward but he still looks a little raw			2
@entity119 , though , and it takes a lot to get past him			0
no frills : neither @entity123 ( @entity22 ) or @entity105 are outstanding but they are rarely beaten @entity124 8/10 with niggling injuries , he is almost forced to sit deeper rather than bomb forward			1
that improves the team shape			2
he is the heartbeat of the side with his range of passing and makes the side secure			2
does what @entity124 does for the @entity136			1
happy to sit deep and has played a lot of football at centre half so has those defensive skills			0
made a fantastic tackle on @entity142 and is key for @entity2			1
men in the middle : @entity145 ( @entity22 ) and @entity124 provide their side 's midfield spine a very interesting player			1
can play a defensive role but likes to play clever passes and through balls			2
a real team player in the final third - if there is a team - mate better placed , he will find them			1
another hard worker who likes to sit alongside @entity145			2
has a big responsibility in there but is a tidy and bullish player			0
gets through a lot of work andpasses well			0
water carriers : @entity164 ( @entity22 ) and @entity165 take care of the less glamorous sides of work my player of the tournament			2
has been playing two roles - he can join @entity173 in the middle or if his midfielders stay central he drifts wide to the right			1
had a decent game against @entity64 , is a good runner with the ball and happy to sling crosses in if he ca n’t go for goal			0
has plenty of energy and helped ease the loss of @entity186			0
no contest : @entity11 ( r ) is shooting for the @entity188 while @entity189 is second choice good passing and even better vision			0
can switch the game from simple five - yard passes to sweeping switches of play if things are tight			2
and give him space on either foot and he ’ll smash one in			0
a very probing player who always tests defenders			0
is n’t happy unless he ’s taking on people			0
@entity64 ’s @entity205 had to come off because he could n’t deal with his pace			0
different strokes : @entity208 ( r ) is @entity0 's pass master while @entity210 has pace to burn has had a relatively quiet tournament but by not doing much he keeps a good shape for the team			1
invariably parks himself on the left to occupy defenders and helps the structure of the side			0
fitting stage for the world ’s best player			2
finally has the chance to lead his country out and be the match winner			0
one of the game ’s best players up against the tournament ’s best team			1
string pullers : @entity21 and @entity234 's @entity233 will orchestrate play from the midfield he gives the team a better balance with the positions he takes up			1
he , @entity233 and @entity124 stay fixed while the rest of the midfield flows around them			1
took him a while to come to the party but that vital goal gave him a lift			0
has improved his play and , with him up top , it helps @entity2 to get the best out of @entity21			1
forward thinking : @entity250 and record breaker @entity173 will lead their respective lines in @entity58 comes on to good effect and really adds to the team with his running and finishing			1
plagued by injury so not quite the @entity259 of old but what a player to have on your bench			1
will be disappointed not to feature more , but he ’s a quality player			0
i have a feeling he might play some part			0
so important for @entity2 with his direct approach			1
may try to time his fitness for the final like one of his runs			1
an outstanding sub to call upon if needed			0
super sub ? @entity259 could make an impact from the bench after recovering from injury bench mark : @entity284 schemer @entity283 will be disappointed not to start not impressed with his hair but he has been useful coming off the bench			1
found it tough in some games but still provides excellent defensive cover			0
another fighter who gives them some tactical flexibility in midfield			2
a talented youngster and his appearance against @entity58 almost felt like a reward			0
lost his place to @entity83 , but gives good cover at the back			0
in reserve : per @entity301 ( r ) and @entity302 provide superb options for @entity305 's germany has grown through the tournament and not been afraid to tweak things in the search for answers			1
moved @entity12 from midfield to full back , changed his centre half pairing and has used @entity173 well			1
after that semi-final performance you ca n’t expect many changes because they seem to have found the best balance and are peaking at the right time			2
can be a bit of a drama queen on the sideliness but he ’s been tactically astute			0
his team virtually picks itself but he has made tweaks to improve it			2
he might have catered to @entity21 ’s needs , but credit to him for getting the best out of his star man in an @entity2 shirt			1
gaffers : @entity0 boss @entity305 ( @entity22 ) has more experience on the big stage than @entity331 best of both worlds : only three @entity2 players make it into @entity5 's composite xi it ’s a tough task picking from these squads but the @entity136 clearly have the superior back five			1
i ’d pick @entity145 ahead of @entity124 because he ’s had the edge in this tournament			1
if @entity341 were fit , i ’d certainly put him in for @entity233 , though @entity210 could work there too			1
i ’d put @entity21 at the top of the pitch where he can do the most damage			1
all three @entity346 would have to keep their shape , though , because that ’s what @entity124 , @entity233 and @entity173 do so well for their team .			1

@entity0 face @entity2 in the 2014 world cup final on *sunday*
@entity305 's team are favourites to become first @entity16 to win the tournament in @entity18
@entity2 boss @entity331 will be hoping star man @entity21 makes the difference
@entity0 have the strongest midfield with the likes of @entity208 , @entity124 and @entity233 pulling the strings
@entity173 is the @entity17 's all - time record scorer with 16 goals
@entity259 could make an impact after recovering from injury
