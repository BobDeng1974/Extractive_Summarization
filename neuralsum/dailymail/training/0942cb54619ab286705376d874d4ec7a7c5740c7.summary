like much of this battered @entity6 @entity5 border town on the front lines in the battle against the @entity10 group , most of its hospitals and clinics now lie in ruins			1
only one is still working - but its location is kept secret for fear it could be targeted by the militants			2
inside the tiny field clinic , saving lives and dealing with horrifying wounds of war comes first , and concerns such as keeping operating rooms sterile and cleaning up after surgery are on the back burner			1
blood is splattered across most of the beds and floors , and a small team of only three doctors and five nurses are providing the only remaining medical services in the town			1
they are sometimes forced to operate by torchlight since power generators regularly fail			1
like much of this besieged @entity6 border town , most of its medical clinics are now in ruins			1
tts location a secret for fear it will be targeted a small team of three doctors and five nurses work at this aid station , treating the flood of @entity5 and @entity55 fighters who are holding the @entity10 militants at bay lucky escape : a @entity5 fighter receives medical attention for a bullet that grazed his temple			1
right , a @entity5 @entity64 commander stands in the rubble in @entity40			2
the scene of intense fighting with @entity10 militants they treat a seemingly unending flood of wounded @entity5 fighters and members of the @entity55 , just yards away from the front lines			0
the @entity75 clinic only has the very basic equipment and regularly runs out of supplies			1
those with more critical wounds must make a mad dash for the border with @entity82 , and wait there for a transport to a better hospital in the neighboring country			0
but losing precious time in the perilous journey often diminishes their chances for survival			2
' if we had a mobile operating unit , we would n't have to leave our wounded at the @entity82 border to wait for six or 10 hours where they sometimes die , ' said @entity95 , a doctor at the @entity40 clinic			2
@entity97 : a young @entity5 @entity64 fighter braves sniper fire in the debris - strewn contested zone in @entity40			2
the fighting has dragged on for months hellish : @entity40 was once an ordinary town of 50,000 people			2
it is now the scene of some of the fiercest urban warfare in @entity6 's civil war incongruous : a cheery bright red heart on a mug offers a stark contrast to the war - blasted buildings and sounds of gunfire across @entity40 male and female @entity5 from across the region - and indeed all over the world - have flocked to the town to fight @entity122 a jury - rigged 10ft sniper rifle used by @entity122 in @entity40			1
many believe the militant group are finally being driven back an exclusive report shot by videojournalist @entity128 inside @entity40 late last month offered a rare , in - depth glimpse of the destruction that more than two months of fighting has inflicted on the @entity5 town in northern @entity6 by the @entity82 border			1
the @entity5 fighters of @entity40 , backed by a small number of @entity137 peshmerga forces and @entity6 rebels , are locked in what they say is a fight to the end against @entity122 , which swept into the town in mid-september			1
the militants ' advance was part of a summer blitz after the @entity147 overran large parts of @entity6 and neighboring @entity137			1
@entity40 , which once had a population of about 50,000 , has seen some of the fiercest urban warfare in @entity6 's civil war , now in its fourth year , and has paid a heavy price for battling the @entity10 extremists			1
desolation : a ruined shop front hints at what the town was like before it became the site of fierce and prolonged fighting remnants of a more civilised time : a gutted police car is among the dozens of destroyed and abandoned vehicles gathering dust in the town fearsome : in this november 19 photo , a @entity5 fighter shows the extent of the damage from a truck bomb in @entity40 it 's so big that it has to be supported on two tripods and fires ammunition that 's three times the size of standard rifle ammo			1
an @entity122 terrorist has been photographed aiming a 10 - foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window in @entity40			2
the fearsome weapon fires 23mm calibre bullets , far larger than the standard size			0
huge casings from the bullets can be seen on the floor next to the gunman			0
what sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate , however , according to firearms expert @entity194			0
he told @entity197 : ' the problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we do n't know for sure what the calibre is , although there would n't be a lot of point in building something like this if it was n't of a significant calibre			0
secondly , and probably of more importance , we do n't know how well it is made : is the barrel accurately machined and rifled ? ' the effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used			0
these rounds exist [ 23mm ] fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary @entity219 will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones			0
' the picture emerged after a show of force from @entity227 's @entity226 , a rival group			0
@entity95 and the others at the @entity40 clinic say the immobility of their facility slows them down , since they can not venture far outside and treat the wounded at the scene - as paramedics and mobile doctors elsewhere do in combat situations			1
still , @entity95 is dedicated to saving @entity40 's wounded as best he can and dreams of someday rebuilding the town clinics and working in a safe operating theater			2
helped by more than 270 airstrikes from a @entity244 - led coalition and an @entity244 airdrop of weapons , the fighters in @entity40 have succeeded in halting the militants ' advance and believe that a corner has been turned			2
but the fight against the @entity10 is not slowing down			0
' we know that the number ( of wounded ) will increase and more injured will come so we have to be ready , ' said @entity95			0
' the most important thing for us is having an operating room			0

@entity262 is part of a team holding an eastern front - line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters			1
three weeks ago , @entity255 bumped into her father on a street corner			0
she was surprised to see him holding a gun			0
she did n't know that he too had decided to fight			0
her mother is a refugee in @entity82 , her only brother studying in @entity285			0
' honestly when i heard my father is fighting on the western front with the @entity64 i was so proud of him , and it made me want to fight more , ' she said .			0

the clinic is the only one left standing in the war - ravaged town that has become a *symbol* for @entity6 civil war
the walls are splattered with blood as the small team of medics barely have time to clean and sterilise
doctors are sometimes forced to operate by torchlight since power generators regularly fail
