@entity1 boss @entity0 insists the club will have the financial clout to tie up a permanent deal for @entity5 in the summer			1
the 27 - year - old is enjoying a fine start to his time at @entity9 having moved to the club on loan from @entity12 at the start of the season			1
the former @entity16 midfielder is attracting interest from some of the @entity20 's biggest clubs , with the @entity21 and @entity22 believed to be looking into the possibility of bringing the @entity25 international back to @entity26 on a permanent basis			1
@entity1 's @entity5 challenges @entity28 for the ball against former club @entity16 @entity0 is confident that @entity1 have enough summer spending money to sign @entity5 in the summer but @entity0 feels that the @entity1 will be able to compete with those clubs for @entity5 's signature and still remain within the constraints of @entity34			1
" i think that next year is next year 's budget and there 's a considerable amount of fund available next season , " he replied when asked if @entity1 could be priced out of a move			2
" they ca n't be spent this season because we 're at the extreme of that budget but next year is a completely new budget			0
" so , affordable ? it depends on what @entity12 are looking for and what @entity5 is looking for , that negotiation will happen at some stage in or around that period			2
" song shows his appreciation for the @entity1 faithful during the 2 - 1 home win against @entity56 having brought in a number of new faces in the summer , @entity0 is likely to have to remain in the loan market if he is to bolster his squad in the january window and the 60 - year - old does not envisage many deals in or out of @entity9			1
" we 're @entity65 with no money available at the moment , " he added			0
" i think what money we do have available is only wages so if a player pops up within that wage structure with what we 've got left with financial fair play - and we feel it 's somebody who could have an immediate impact on the team - then we will pursue it but we think that 's highly unlikely in this window			0
song is still a @entity12 player but looks set for a permanent switch away from the @entity81 this summer " but you never know what turns up in the next two or three weeks			1
we will never say never but probably highly unlikely			0
" @entity0 also said there has been no change in @entity87 's situation despite a reported interest from @entity16 in the @entity90 defender			2
@entity87 , 26 , is out of contract in the summer but @entity0 has insisted in recent weeks he will not allow the player to leave on the cheap this month			2
@entity16 have been struggling for numbers in defensive positions for much of the season and have again been hit by a long - term injury to @entity97			0
@entity87 looks set for the @entity1 exit doors with the @entity90 international yet to agree a new deal they have @entity102 on loan at @entity1 but @entity0 does not believe there is a chance he could be recalled to the @entity106 before his deal runs out at the end of the campaign			1
" i 'm 99 per cent sure he 's ours for the season to be fair , " he said			0
" i do n't think there is a call back clause in this month			0
" the @entity1 welcome @entity116 to @entity9 on sunday looking for their first @entity20 win since december 20 , having failed to pick up a victory in their last four league outings			0
@entity116 have won twice in that time but @entity122 's @entity121 are embroiled in the relegation battle and could travel to east @entity125 bottom of the table if results on saturday go against them			0
@entity97 could be out for three months but @entity0 is confident @entity102 will not be recalled on - loan @entity129 celebrates @entity132 's goal against @entity22 at @entity9			1

@entity5 is currently on - loan at @entity1 from @entity12
