@entity1 , who has anger management issues , injured the infant by his rough handling of it , a court heard a man who broke a baby 's arm and leg through ' reckless cruelty ' has been spared jail			1
doctors said the infant 's broken leg may have been caused by @entity1 ' yanking ' it out of its cot , while its broken arm appeared to be the result of a ' forceful rapid rotation injury '			1
but @entity1 , who has anger management issues , denied yanking the baby , telling the court he had lifted it out its cot by its arms			2
at @entity26 , the 20 - year - old pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of ' reckless rough handling '			1
he was allowed to walk free from court after he was handed a suspended sentence			0
@entity32 , prosecuting , said : ' @entity33 are opening the case on the basis of rough handling and reckless behaviour			2
' @entity33 say there was not deliberate pulling in order to hurt the child , but an impatience to get the child to do what the defendant ignorantly thought the child ought to be able to bear			0
' it 's clear the defendant has a short fuse and can be an angry individual who has a problem with his temper , especially when drunk			0
' when he was told about the injuries he became very silent and dropped his head			0
' @entity26 @entity26 heard how the baby was taken to hospital because it 's right arm was not moving freely and x-rays discovered fractures to the arm and leg			1
@entity1 from @entity61 , who admitted child cruelty , was given an eight - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work			1
judge @entity67 told @entity1 : ' you accept you were too rough			2
the child suffered two separate fractures			0
' i accept that you bitterly regret this , it is clear from your letter			0
you were 19 at the time , you are now 20 , have clearly grown up and are determined to put this behind you			0
but the 20 - year - old denied yanking the baby 's leg at @entity79 ( pictured ) and pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of ' reckless rough handling ' ' i do n't consider you are a dangerous offender and sending you to immediate custody is going to achieve very little in this case			1
' @entity85 , defending , said : ' he is a 20 - year - old man who is young , immature and naive			1
' the injuries were caused when he was roughly handling the child			2
he has learned a very harsh lesson indeed			0

@entity1 had broken the infant 's leg and arm lifting it out of its cot
the 20 - year - old admitted child cruelty *due* to his ' reckless rough handling '
@entity26 heard @entity1 , 20 , had anger issues and had been ' impatient '
