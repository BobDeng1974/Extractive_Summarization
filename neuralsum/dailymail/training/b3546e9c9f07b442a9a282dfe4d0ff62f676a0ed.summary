by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 07:41 est , 20 september 2013 of the many dramatic storylines featured in @entity2 to keep sunday night viewers hooked - the most prevalent has always been what will happen to the house and whether it will stay in the family			1
so perhaps it is somewhat fitting that the owner of @entity10 , the setting for the period drama , fears the estate could be broken up and sold - because of changing inheritance laws			1
in an interview with @entity17 , the 8th @entity15 said changes in the law of royal succession , which now allow first - born daughters to accede to the throne ahead of their younger brothers , could put estates across the country in jeopardy			1
fears : the @entity15 fears his estate - the setting for @entity2 - is in danger of being sold because of changing inheritance laws he said the change , which has prompted some to argue for an abolition of male primogeniture when it comes to aristocratic titles and estates , was a step towards the @entity42 @entity41 - which decreed property should be split equally among offspring			1
the idea has never gained traction in this country , but some in certain circles fear it may only be a matter of time before it becomes law			1
the @entity15 said : ' there 's obviously a reason for these things , which was to keep the place intact with the same name attached to it			2
' if you go further down that road , you are going to be heading towards the @entity41 , which would break up all the great @entity60 places and that would be the end of them			2
it would mean selling them all , which probably would n't be the best idea			0
' the concern echoes one of season one 's main plotlines - when the title and inheritance of @entity2 when to distance cousin @entity73			1
the @entity75 family have come close to losing their 50 - bedroom , 6,000 acre estate before over the past 100 years â€“ as @entity75 reveals in her new biography , @entity79			2
she said : ' after doing my research , i am amazed we are still here			0
' the title dies or slips to a cousin then that 's it - there 's no point worrying about it			0
' storyline : inheritance was a main plot in the first series of the drama - the fourth series of which is due to return to our screens this weekend other families have been stung in the past by such laws - including the daughters of @entity100 , the 14th @entity101 , who failed to prevent the title from passing to someone he had never met			2
@entity105 , 72 , claimed the title based on @entity108 's descent from a junior line of the family that split off in 1654			0
the latter case has been used by pressure groups who are trying to seek gender equality in line with changes to the royal succession			1
@entity119 of @entity120 , a member of one group of more 100 noble families , told @entity123 : ' the @entity125 case shows quite clearly how ridiculous , unfair and iniquitous the current system of inheritance is			1
the @entity119 did however accept that things had moved on from the world portrayed in @entity2			0
she added : ' in today 's world these houses are not personal assets anyway			0
this is not our personal asset			0
' it is our personal passion and our home for the time being , but it 's a shared treasure			0
' we can only pass it on in as good a nick as possible ad then it is up to the next generation			0

the 8th @entity15 owns @entity10 - the setting for @entity2
fears changes in the law of royal succession , allowing first - born daughters to accede to the throne , could put estates across the country in jeopardy
move could be a step towards @entity42 @entity41 - which allows property to be split equally among offspring , he says
pressure group says changes to current ' unfair ' system are necessary for certain estates to stay within the family
