he framed the choice for voters as between @entity39 focused on the middle class and @entity41 wanting to protect the wealthy and return to policies that led to the 2008 economic collapse			0
the advisers said @entity18 will argue that voters have a similar choice in 2016			2
@entity18 also intends to sell herself as being able to work with @entity47 , businesses and world leaders			1
that approach could be perceived as a critique of @entity11 , @entity18 's rival for the nomination in 2008			1
he has largely been unable to fulfill his pledge to end @entity56 's intense partisanship and found much of his presidency stymied by gridlock with @entity47			2

' it 's time for her			0
' as her official announcement loomed , the @entity97 linked @entity18 to @entity11 , a regular focus of criticism from the @entity41			2
' all @entity2 is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown @entity56 instead of the middle class , ' @entity97 spokesman @entity102 said in a statement			0
' that 's why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction , not four more years of @entity11 's failed policies			1
' @entity18 is not expected to roll out detailed policy positions in the first weeks of her campaign			2
@entity18 plans to sell herself as being able to work with @entity47 , businesses and world leaders advisers said she planned to talk about ways families can increase take - home pay , the importance of expanding early childhood education and making higher education more affordable			1
it 's not yet clear whether that will include a noticeable break with @entity11 on economic policy			0
the @entity41 has hammered @entity11 's approach as anti-business and insufficient in the wake of the recession			2
the @entity31 says the economy has improved significantly in recent years			0
the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in march , but manufacturing and new home construction slowed , cheaper gas has yet to ignite consumer spending and participation in the labor force remains sluggish			0
@entity18 will enter the race as the overwhelming favorite for her party 's nomination			0
still , her team has said her early strategy is designed to avoid appearing to take that nomination for granted			0

she was a great supporter of mine in the general election			0

i think she would be an excellent president , and i 'm not on the ballot so i 'm not going to step on her lines , ' @entity11 said from @entity158 as he wrapped up participation in a summit of @entity162 leaders			1
@entity18 's early events will include discussions at colleges , day care centers and private homes , and stops at coffee shops and diners			1
after about a month of such events , @entity18 will give a broader speech outlining more specifics about her rationale for running			2
@entity18 's husband , @entity176 , and daughter , @entity178 , are unlikely to appear at her early events			1
@entity18 , the former two - term president , said recently that he wanted to play a role as a ' backstage adviser ' in his wife 's campaign			1
advisers said @entity18 has been engaged with his wife in some of the policy discussions leading up to this weekend 's rollout			2
to prepare for the campaign , @entity18 has spent months meeting with economic policy experts , including @entity190 , whose research focuses on inequality , and @entity193 , a labor economist and retirement policy expert			0
