by @entity1 reporter published : 12:15 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 02:58 est , 14 november 2012 @entity3 chief @entity2 has hit out at @entity5 ministers after debt - ridden @entity6 secured more than £ 3bn in short - term funding			1
@entity6 managed to raise the cash from the sale of short - term treasury bills tuesday and the money will be use to help make a crucial debt repayment at the end of the week			2
while @entity17 finance ministers have suggested that @entity18 should be given until 2022 to lower its debt / gdp ratio to 120 per cent , ms @entity2 insisted the existing target of 2020 should remain			1
@entity3 managing director @entity2 ( right ) chats with @entity6 finance minister @entity22 at the start of a @entity25 finance ministers meeting in @entity26 she said : ' we clearly have different views			2
what matters at the end of the day is the sustainability of @entity6 debt so that country can be back on its feet			2
' behind her sharp exchange with @entity25 chairman @entity35 lies a rift over whether euro zone governments need to write off some of @entity6 's debt to them to make it manageable			1
@entity3 officials have pressed for such a ' haircut ' while @entity44 , the biggest contributor to euro zone bailout funds , has vehemently rejected it as illegal			2
@entity44 finance minister @entity48 told reporters on tuesday that the 2020 deadline was ' a little too ambitious '			0
' there 's a debate about a haircut for official creditors			0
on that i will say and most countries have said so in the past few weeks that that 's legally not possible , ' he added			0
@entity2 is in dispute with @entity25 chairman @entity35 ( pictured ) over whether euro zone governments need to write off some of @entity6 's debt to them to make it manageable chancellor @entity65 has signalled she wants to keep @entity6 in the euro zone but is determined to avoid losses for @entity44 taxpayers before a general election in september 2013			1
with so much stake , diplomats remain confident that a deal will be done to release a 31.5 billion euros tranche of bailout money which @entity18 urgently requires to avert bankruptcy.but it is a way off yet			2
financial markets , which have been calmed by the @entity78 's pledge to buy euro zone government bonds to shore up the currency bloc , took a dim view of the failure to agree			1
the euro dipped to a two - month low against the dollar and safe - haven @entity44 @entity86 futures rose to two - month highs			0
' there seems to be quite a big difference of opinion between the @entity3 and euro zone finance ministers ... but our view is still that @entity6 wo n't leave the euro zone , ' @entity89 rate strategist @entity88 said			1
@entity35 , who heads the 17 - nation group of euro zone finance ministers , said a further @entity25 meeting would take place on nov. 20 and officials said more negotiations could be required the week after that to nail down a new deal			2
@entity105 finance minister @entity104 told reporters on tuesday that bailout money should flow by the end of the month			0
' our objective is to reach an agreement in principle on november 20 so that we can ... proceed to the disbursement of funds by the end of this month , ' he said			0
the delay leaves @entity18 scrambling to meet a 5 billion euro bond repayment deadline on friday , but @entity5 officials were confident that it would not default			2
with @entity6 's overall debt pile set to hit 190 percent of gdp next year , the @entity3 has set 120 percent as the target , saying that anything much above that is not sustainable given @entity6 's low growth prospects and high external borrowing requirements			1
amid calls for a national strike , @entity6 has secured a £ 3bn in short - term funding which will be used to help make a crucial debt repayment at the end of the week ' all avenues in order to reduce debt on @entity6 are being explored and will continue to be explored in the coming days , ' @entity2 said			1
if the @entity3 , which is concerned about its own integrity , were to walk away from the @entity6 bailout , the euro zone would have to contribute extra funds and its reputation in financial markets could be severely damaged			1
equally , if the @entity3 were to back down , its authority would be diminished			0
the euro zone ministers did agree on monday to give @entity6 two more years to make the spending cuts demanded of it but by doing so they face an extra funding bill of around 33 billion euros , according to a document prepared for the meeting			1
a target was set in march for @entity6 to achieve a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of @entity119 in 2014			0
that will now be moved to 2016 giving @entity18 some breathing space to temper a deep recession that is to all intents and purposes a depression			0
@entity44 finance minister @entity48 said the 2020 deadline was ' a little too ambitious ' despite @entity6 approving a tough 2013 budget last week , which it hoped would meet conditions for the release of the next tranche of emergency loans under its second bailout programme , @entity2 said more work was needed to cement the budget measures			2
' there will be a few , only a few additional prior actions to be verified in the coming days , ' she said			0
loans have been held up since @entity18 , which has received two bailout packages from the euro zone and @entity3 , went off - track with promised reforms and budget cuts , partly as a result of holding two elections in the space of three months earlier this year			1
until the bailout money flows , @entity6 will issue more short - term paper to keep itself afloat			0
@entity18 will sell one - and three - month t - bills later on tuesday to refinance the 5 billion euro issue maturing on nov. 16			0
its debt agency expressed confidence the issue will be fully funded.three officials told @entity181 that the troika had concluded that @entity6 's debt burden will fall only to 144 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and roughly 10 percentage points lower two years later if current policies do not change			1
to get the higher figure down to 120 percent of @entity119 requires lopping the best part of 50 billion euros of @entity6 's debt pile			1
among the new instruments under consideration to reduce @entity6 debt are the removal of the 150 - basis - point interest above financing costs on 53 billion euros of bilateral government loans to @entity6 , and lengthening the maturity of the loans			0
@entity6 may also borrow from the euro zone bailout fund to buy back its privately held debt , of which there is 50 - 60 billion euros , taking advantage of the deep discount it trades at to save money on redemptions and interest payments			1
' it may be that we take some measures to reduce interest rates that will have an immediate effect on the budget , ' @entity48 said			0
' apart from that we expect that the problems will be solved within the financial framework of the second programme by allowing more time with additional measures			0

dispute over whether @entity18 should be given until 2022 to lower its debt / gdp ratio to 120 per cent
