but the ultimate goal of finding a world that truly resembles our own has continued to elude astronomers			0
now researchers have come a step closer by finding @entity7 's gassy twin in another solar system 200 light years away			2
@entity7 's gassy twin as been discovered in another solar system 200 light years away			2
pictured is an artist 's impression of @entity22 in orbit around its star			2
it orbits a dim red dwarf star at such a close distance that temperatures on its surface could be as high as 104 째 c the planet , known as @entity22 , weighs the same as the @entity7 but is 60 per cent larger , leading scientists to suspect it has a thick gaseous atmosphere			1
it orbits a dim red dwarf star at such a close distance that temperatures on its surface could be as high as 104 째 c - too hot for most forms of life on @entity7			1
@entity43 - @entity42 is only 30 per cent more dense than water			0
this suggests that the world is enveloped by a blanket of hydrogen and helium hundreds of miles thick			1

scientists believe it may have started life as a mini-neptune before some of its atmospheric gases were blasted away by intense radiation from the parent star			0

' this planet might have the same mass as @entity7 , but it is certainly not @entity7 - like , ' said lead astronomer dr @entity77 from the @entity78			1
' it proves that there is no clear dividing line between rocky worlds like @entity7 and fluffier planets like water worlds or gas giants			0
' the findings were presented at the annual meeting of the @entity88 in @entity89 to weigh @entity43 - 314c , the scientists used a new technique called transit timing variations ( @entity93 ) , which only works when more than one planet orbits a star			2
the two planets tug on each other , slightly altering the time they take to cross or ' transit ' the star 's face			0
analysing the way the planetary wobbles affect light coming from the star makes it possible to calculate their mass. the new discovery was made by chance as scientists scoured data from the @entity113 space telescope looking for evidence of moons rather than planets @entity22 's companion world is similar to it in size but weighs four times more than the @entity7			1

' when we noticed this planet showed transit timing variations , the signature was clearly due to the other planet in the system and not a moon , ' said dr @entity77			0
' at first we were disappointed it was n't a moon , but then we soon realised it was an extraordinary measurement			0

planet is covered by blanket of hydrogen and helium hundreds of miles thick
named @entity22 , it weighs the same as the @entity7 but is 60 per cent larger
it orbits a red dwarf star at such a close distance that temperatures on its surface could be as high as 104 째 c - too hot for most forms of life on @entity7
