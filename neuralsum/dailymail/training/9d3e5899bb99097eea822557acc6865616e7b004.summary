while some women can enjoy multiple orgasms a day , others can struggle to hit the spot			2
now a machine that claims to deliver an orgasm at the push of a button has been patented in the @entity8 , but in order to tap into such convenient pleasure , there is some pain			2
the machine is designed to be a medical implant and includes an implant a little smaller than a packet of cigarettes , requiring an operation			1
it uses electrodes to trigger an orgasm			2
a machine that claims to deliver an orgasm ( illustrated ) at the push of a button has been patented in the @entity8 that could one day be used to treat women with orgasmic dysfunction a remote control could be used by an individual to send a signal to the implant			1
it would stimulate nerves with electrical pulses to trigger an orgasm			0
contacts would have to be surgically inserted into certain nerves in the spinal cord			0
a signal generator would also have to be fitted under a patient 's skin - possibly in their buttocks			0
its creator hopes the box of tricks could be used to treat women with orgasmic dysfunction			1
@entity48 , who studies the neurobiology of sexual behaviour at @entity51 in @entity52 told @entity53 : ‘ some women confuse what 's called sympathetic arousal , like increased heart rate , clammy hands , nerves and so on , with fear			0
that makes them want to get out of the situation			0
’ while @entity63 is a common treatment , the implant could ‘ solve ’ the condition using a more manual approach			2
a patient would remain conscious during an operation to fit the implant , where a surgeon will pinpoint the correct nerves to which to fit the electrodes in a patient 's spinal cord			1
they would connect to a signal generator - just smaller than a packet of cigarettes - that could be implanted under the skin of a patient ’s buttocks			1
the idea is that the implant could be triggered by a hand - held remote control , delivering orgasms at the push of a button – and it could even be programmed to deliver a number of orgasms per week or per day			1
a patient would remain conscious during an operation to fit the implant , where a surgeon will pinpoint the correct nerves to which to fit the electrodes in a patient 's spinal cord ( illustrated ) orgasmic dysfunction is when a woman either ca n't reach orgasm , or has difficulty reaching orgasm when she is sexually excited			1
around 10 to 15 per cent of women have never had an orgasm			0
surveys suggest that between 33 per cent and 50 per cent of women are dissatisfied with how often the reach orgasm , according to @entity104			0
current treatments include : cognitive behavioural therapy and practical education			0
but details have yet to be decided and clinical trials are set to begin later this year			1
@entity111 , a surgeon at @entity112 and pain consultants in @entity114 , @entity110 is behind the technology and came up with the idea by accident			1
‘ i was placing the electrodes and suddenly the woman started exclaiming emphatically , ’ he said			0
‘ i asked her what was up and she said , “ you 're going to have to teach my husband to do that			0
” ’ mr @entity111 has not yet tested the device on men , but said there is no reason to think that it could not be used to achieve the same result			2
a @entity131 - based company called @entity132 is set to conduct the medical trials but mr @entity111 said that the treatment is intended to be used in the most serious cases of orgasmic dysfunction because it is as invasive as a pacemaker			1
however , dr @entity48 said that as teenagers currently endure painful operations to enlarge their breasts , they are likely to endure invasive surgery to reach orgasm more easily			0
a surgical implant could be triggered by a hand - held remote control , delivering orgasms at the push of a button ( illustrated ) and it could even be programmed to deliver a number of orgasms per week or per day			2

a surgeon in @entity114 , @entity110 , came up with the idea for the device , which could be used to treat orgasmic dysfunction
the machine includes a medical implant a little smaller than a packet of cigarettes that requires an operation to work
medical trials are expected to begin later this year in @entity131
