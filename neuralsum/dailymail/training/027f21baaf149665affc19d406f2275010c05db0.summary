by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:33 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 09:47 est , 25 december 2012 @entity2 said that she is confident in the face of speculation that she will be replaced in favor of a lighter morning show once @entity7 undergoes the predicted transformation that will come @entity9 takes the reins			1
' i 'm fairly confident that i 'm not going to be cooking salmon and doing fashion shows on @entity7 , ' @entity2 said in a recent interview			2
former @entity15 boss @entity9 is now in charge of @entity7 as the cable news channel had been floundering in the ratings for months			1
the concern for @entity2 comes as she currently headlines the channel 's morning program @entity22 from 7am to 9am , but new theory poses that fellow @entity7 anchor @entity24 may be moved from her evening show to an earlier position			1
how long will it last ? @entity2 began anchoring @entity7 's morning program @entity22 in january shakeup : @entity9 supposedly thinks that @entity24 is a ‘ real talent ’ and that she could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by @entity31 @entity9 supposedly thinks that @entity24 is a ‘ real talent , ' despite her failure to gain much traction in prime time with her 7 pm show , eponymous @entity38 , and that she could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by @entity31			1
the plan would be to try and recreate some of the magic which @entity9 did at @entity15 in the 1990s when he started today on its 16 - year run as the number one morning show			1
that does n't concern @entity2 , she claims , because she is excited to be working with him again since they both started out their careers at @entity15			2
' he was my boss years ago when i worked at the ' today ' show			0
i 'm absolutely thrilled to have him back , ' she said in an interview with the @entity55			0
not concerned : @entity2 says that she if not getting hung up with the speculation about the expected reshuffle at @entity7 following @entity9 's placement @entity2 made the switch from @entity15 to @entity7 in 2003 and she has been a part of their morning lineup ever since , starting with @entity63 - then moved on to anchoring specials and appearing in other segments of the network 's line up - and then anchored starting point since january of this year			1
' listen , i have been doing this gig for a while			0
people go crazy with speculation every time there ’s a shift in leadership			0
i ca n’t comment on every rumor , but so far i ’ve read reports on me , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity24 , and all that ’s clear to me is that somebody ’s busy dialing @entity82 , ' she said			0
new talent : should @entity9 make move @entity24 , left , to the morning slot , it could be a slap in the face to @entity2 , right , who only in january was made anchor of @entity7 ’s @entity22 , which runs from 7am to 9am @entity24 left @entity15 and its sister cable networks in 2011 , when she was passed over for the today show co-hosting gig in favor of @entity78			1
ratings plummeted , @entity78 was dumped from the program this summer , and @entity15 replaced @entity78 with @entity94 , center left in purple			2
the today show has fallen behind @entity98 since @entity94 joined whoever the leaker is , they appear to have pretty clear expectations for how the reshuffle will fall into place if @entity24 moves to headline a morning show			2
' he ’ll team her up with a guy , and they ’ll go after the audience watching today and @entity111 , ' the unidentified source tells the @entity112			0
‘ one thing @entity9 knows how to do is a morning show			0
’ @entity24 , 36 , a former financial analyst , got her big break on @entity117 hosting business show @entity118 and @entity119 on the street before joining @entity7 in 2011			1
@entity122 show regularly gets twice as many viewers as she did on @entity117 , but @entity7 is more widely available than @entity117 and does broader interest news .			0

@entity2 anchors current @entity7 morning program @entity22
theory is @entity24 is going to be moved from evening show to morning slot
@entity24 would go head - to - head with former *rivals* @entity137
