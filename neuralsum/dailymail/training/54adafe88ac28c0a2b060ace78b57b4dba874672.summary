by @entity0 published : 16:57 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 17:19 est , 1 august 2013 suspicious : @entity1 believes her family 's @entity3 searches caused a ' @entity5 ' to visit her house a @entity8 woman believes her family 's recent @entity3 searches caused a wednesday morning visit by federal agents			1
@entity1 , a writer for @entity13 , published an account of what happened on medium today , saying six plain - clothes cops showed up at her home , and proceeded to interview her husband about pressure cookers and search her house			1
she believes her ' news junkie ' son reading articles on the @entity24 , coupled with her hunt for a pressure cooker and her husband 's online shopping for a backpack created the ' perfect storm of terrorism profiling			2
' but so far the @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 have denied their part in the call			1
while she was n't at home at the time , her husband was when three black suvs drove up to their house and the cops exited and started to approach their property , flashing badges with handguns in their holsters			2
her husband went outside to meet the men and complied with their request to look around the house and backyard			2
they walked around the living room , looked at books and pictures , and petted their dogs			2
when they asked to go into the son 's room , her husband said he was sleeping and they left him alone			0
they also interviewed him , asking about where he was from , where his wife was , and if they had any bombs			0
they also asked about whether they owned a pressure cooker			0
her husband said no , but that they had a rice cooker			0
' can you make a bomb with that ? ' they asked			0
he told them his wife used it to make quinoa			0
' what the hell is quinoa ? ' they asked			0
what the hell is quinoa ? after asking whether the family had a pressure cooker , @entity1 's husband said they only have a rice cooker to cook quinoa			1
the officers were mystified by the ancient grain @entity1 said that ' by this point they realized they were not dealing with terrorists and the men wrapped their search up			1
her husband called her immediately after , laughing about the incident , but @entity1 did n't see the humor			1
she said she felt a ' great sense of anxiety ' when she realized that ' this is where we are at			0
' ' where you have no expectation of privacy			0
where trying to learn how to cook some lentils could possibly land you on a terrorism watch list , ' she wrote			0
the @entity32 confirmed the visit to @entity113 , but said their officers were n't involved			1
a spokesman said it was @entity33 police officers working in conjunction with the @entity119			1
but a @entity33 police spokesman told @entity122 they were n't involved			1
' we did not , did not , go out to this woman 's home , ' police spokesman @entity123 said			0
' what agency went i could n't tell you			0
' a @entity34 spokesman referred media back to the @entity32			1
if the search were truly carried out due to suspicious @entity3 searches , it would have required a warrant			1
in a company report on transparency , @entity3 detailed how they deal with law enforcement officials looking for evidence online			1
' the government needs legal process — such as a subpoena , court order or search warrant — to force @entity3 to disclose user information			1
exceptions can be made in certain emergency cases , though even then the government ca n’t force @entity3 to disclose			2
' which has led some to question the validity of ms @entity1 's story			2
today , she took to @entity153 , writing that she was n't giving interviews to the media			2
' i 'll say it once : i did n't make it up , ' she wrote			0
' thanks to those defending my integrity			0
