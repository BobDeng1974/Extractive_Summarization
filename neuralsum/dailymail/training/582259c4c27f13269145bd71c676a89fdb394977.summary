by @entity0 published : 10:32 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 3 june 2013 the controversy surrounding why @entity3 's famous moon quote was misheard by millions of people worldwide may have been less to do with dodgy recording equipment and more to do with his unique @entity7 accent			1
when @entity3 walked on the moon the astronaut claimed to have said : ' that 's one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind ' , but most listeners claim they ca n't hear the first ' a ' and the statement has become best known without it			1
poor recording equipment was previously blamed for the mishearing , yet linguistic experts now claim a unique feature of @entity3 's @entity7 accent could be to blame			1
during the moon landing of 1969 , @entity3 was recorded by @entity24 as saying : ' that 's one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind			1
' however , many people claim they ca n't hear @entity3 's ' a ' in the recording and the quote has become famous with it missing			1
this mishearing was initially blamed on poor recording equipment , yet speech scientists from @entity34 and @entity7 claim it could have been caused by the way @entity3 's accent made him blend his words @entity38 astronaut @entity3 always stood by the fact he said ' for a ' and not ' for ' in his famous moon landing quote from the @entity42 mission in 1969 speech scientists from @entity44 and @entity45 analysed the clip and studied how speakers from his native central @entity7 pronounce ' for ' and ' for a '			1
the team suggest that in the midwestern @entity38 state @entity7 there is typically a lot of blending between words such as ' for ' and ' a. ' and these results suggest it 's entirely possible that @entity3 said what he claimed , even though people are statistically more likely to hear ' for man ' instead of ' for a man ' on the recording			1
dr @entity60 of @entity44 , said : ' prior acoustic analyses of @entity3 's recording have established well that if the word ' a ' was spoken , it was very short and was fully blended acoustically with the preceding word			1
' ' if @entity3 actually did say ' a ' , it sounded something like " frrr ( uh )			0
' ' his blending of the two words , compounded with the poor sound quality of the transmission , has made it difficult for people to corroborate his claim that the ' a ' is there			0
' @entity60 and her colleagues carried out a statistical analysis of the duration of the ' r ' sound as spoken by native central @entity81 saying ' for ' and ' for a ' in natural conversation			0
when @entity3 listened back to the recordings of his famous moon quote , he admitted that he had n't heard himself say the ' a ' either but insists he did actually say the often misheard words in 2006 , a computer analysis found evidence that @entity3 said what he said he said			1
@entity91 , an @entity92 computer programmer , ran a software analysis looking at sound waves and found a wave that would have been the missing ' a '			0
it lasted 35 milliseconds , much too quick to be heard			0
the @entity98 's space curator , @entity97 , looked at the evidence and found it convincing			0
@entity24 has also stood by its moon man			0
' if @entity3 says there was an ' a , ' then as far as we 're concerned , there was ' a , '' @entity24 spokesman @entity103 said shortly before the 40th anniversary of the @entity42 mission			0
@entity3 died in august last year , aged 82 , and maintained until the end that there was a lost word in his famous words from the moon			2
they used a collection of recordings of conversational speech from 40 people raised in @entity118 , @entity7 , near @entity3 's native town of @entity120			1
within these recordings they found 191 cases of ' for a. ' they then matched each of these to an instance of ' for ' as said by the same speaker and compared the relative duration			0
they also examined the duration of @entity3 's ' for ( a ' ) from @entity24 's lunar transmission			1
they discovered a large overlap between the relative duration of the ' r ' sound in ' for ' and ' for a ' using the @entity7 speech data			2
the duration of the ' frrr ( uh ) ' in @entity3 's recording was 0.127 seconds , which falls into the middle of this overlap , though it is a slightly better match for when the ' a ' is missing			1
this means that the quotation is compatible with either possible interpretation but the researchers accept it is slightly more likely to be perceived as ' for ' , regardless of what @entity3 actually said			2
in 2006 , computer analysis found evidence that @entity3 said what he said he said and this may have been backed up by a linguistics study by speech scientists at @entity44 and @entity45			1
they analysed his famous quote and the accents of 40 other people who grew up in the same state as @entity3 dr @entity60 says there may have been a ' perfect storm of conditions ' for the word ' a ' to have been spoken but not heard			1
she said : ' we 've bolstered @entity3 's side of the story			2
' we feel we 've partially vindicated him			0
' but we 'll most likely never know for sure exactly what he said based on the acoustic information			0
' she said that the work has implications beyond @entity3 's timeless quotation			2
@entity60 added : ' every time we listen to speech and think we understand a sentence , we are performing a miraculous task , which is to take what is actually a continuous acoustic signal , break up that signal into somewhat arbitrary parts , and map those parts to our memories of all the words that we know in the language			0
' we need only look at computer speech recognition and how it succeeds and how it largely often fails to see how very difficult that problem is			0
' astronaut @entity3 died last august aged 82			0
he maintained until the end that there was a lost word in his famous words from the moon @entity60 and her team 's findings will be presented at the 21st @entity197 on @entity198 in @entity199			2
in 2006 , computer analysis similarly found evidence that @entity3 said what he said he said			2
@entity91 , an @entity92 computer programmer , ran a software analysis looking at sound waves and found a wave that would have been the missing ' a '			0
it lasted 35 milliseconds , much too quick to be heard			0
@entity3 was born in @entity120 in the midwestern @entity38 state of @entity7			1
speech scientists found that people from this region blend their words and this could be the reason why the ' a ' is so often misheard in @entity3 's famous moon quote the @entity98 's space curator , @entity97 , looked at the evidence and found it convincing and @entity24 also stood by its moon man			1
' if @entity3 says there was an ' a , ' then as far as we 're concerned , there was ' a , '' @entity24 spokesman @entity103 said shortly before the 40th anniversary of the @entity42 mission			0
@entity3 , who died last august aged 82 , maintained until the end that there was a lost word in his famous words from the moon			2
video : @entity3 's historic first steps on the moon			2

speech scientists studied @entity3 's accent during recordings of his famous ' one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind ' quote
they also analysed the accents of 40 other people from in and around his *hometown* of @entity120 , @entity7
researchers found that *participants* typically blended their words and this may be the cause for millions mishearing @entity3 's words
