mr @entity28 , of @entity38 , put his son down for a nap on sunday february 8 , believing he was recovering from a bout of chickenpox			1
but when he woke for his lunch , @entity11 was having difficulty breathing and his temperature was soaring			1
mr @entity28 , an optical lab technician , said : ' we took him to @entity48 where he had blood tests done and were told he had an infection of some sort , but that antibiotics could n't be administered until it was clear exactly what was wrong			2
' @entity11 was administered to the ward for observation and was going to be kept in overnight , but he died before the morning			2

in an estimated one per cent of cases , though , serious complications can develop such as pneumonia , meningitis , encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) , inflammation of the heart and toxic shock , a type of blood poisoning - all usually down to impaired immunity			1
