@entity0 has revealed the reason behind his furious rant at fourth official @entity3 towards the end of @entity6 ’s defeat at @entity7 on sunday			1
the @entity6 boss was incensed that @entity9 was not penalised for a foul against @entity11 , who managed to stay on his feet despite a late challenge from @entity7 ’s £ 32million defender			1
referee @entity15 took no action as the ball ran out of play and an animated @entity0 vented his fury towards @entity3 on the touchline			1
@entity0 gives fourth official @entity3 a piece of his mind during @entity6 's defeat the @entity6 boss also screams at the linesman during the 2 - 0 loss to @entity7 @entity0 snarls in frustration alongside @entity27 from the touchline at the @entity29 the @entity31 boss launched a tirade at the fourth official before eventually sharing a smile with him @entity0 can not resist taking an extended pop at @entity3 from the sidelines it was highlighted on @entity38 but the 60 - year - old later questioned whether @entity11 had paid the price for his honesty instead of taking a fall and earning his team a freekick			1
‘ everybody goes on about simulation and players cheating and doing this and that , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ @entity9 comes out and tries to clean out @entity11			2
‘ @entity11 stays on his feet and the assistant is one yard off and does n’t flag for the foul			0
so what do i say to @entity11 ? “ for @entity56 ’s sake dive on the floor and get a freekick ? ” because we could put the freekick in and get a goal			0
’ @entity0 was unhappy with @entity11 for giving away possession in the build - up to @entity7 ’s second goal scored by @entity65 , having already conceded an own - goal from @entity67			2
@entity0 was aggrieved because a foul by @entity9 on @entity11 ( not pictured ) was missed @entity65 finished off a fine move to hand the @entity70 a 2 - 0 win to get their season back on track he added : ‘ the disappointing thing in the first half was the goals we gifted to @entity7 and the amount of possession we allowed ourselves to lose			1
‘ the two mistakes we make for the goals , one was pretty bizarre and the other unexpected from a player as experienced as @entity11			0
‘ in the second half eventually changing the system got us going forward , and when we create as good chances as those for @entity87 and @entity88 we have to convert them			0
but the most disappointing thing was the goals we gifted @entity7			0
