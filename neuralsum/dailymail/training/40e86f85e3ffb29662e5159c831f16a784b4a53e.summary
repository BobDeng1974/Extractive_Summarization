a drainpipe might have been a perfect bolthole for @entity2 the hamster when she escaped from her cage , but she soon found she was stuck			2
once her worried owners @entity7 and @entity8 tracked her down via a small hole under their kitchen sink – and the sound of her claws scrabbling on the pipework – they spent four days dropping in food to try to coax her up			1
eventually , though , they realised she was simply making herself at home in the pipe and enjoying her hand - delivered meals			1
nutty : @entity2 the hamster ( pictured ) escaped with the help of an enticing peanut dangled on a piece of string cheeky : the hamster spent several days down the drainage pipe as part of a failed escape bid it was time to call in expert help in the form of drainage engineer @entity30 , who used a small camera to pinpoint @entity2 ’s location three metres down the pipe			1
next , he pushed a small piece of mesh into the pipe to act as a ladder and dropped in a peanut attached to a piece of string			1
as mr @entity30 slowly withdrew the nut , @entity2 followed			2
she is now safely back in her cage in her owners ’ @entity48 home			1
‘ she ’s got big padlocks on her cage now – it ca n’t happen again , ’ said mr @entity7			2
mr @entity7 , 40 , who works in motorcycle sales , said he and pharmacy assistant @entity52 , 52 , were relieved to have @entity2 back after believing they had lost her for good			0
' it was crazy , ' he said			0
' @entity52 was in tears when we got her back and @entity2 was just looking at me as if she was asking what the problem was			0
' quite at home : the couple had been dropping down food to their pet , but she was just eating it all mr @entity7 , left with his partner @entity8 , said : ' i thought hamsters were supposed to be quite quiet ' the couple , who also have a guinea pig called @entity71 and a budgie , @entity73 , said @entity2 has proved to have a restless personality since they bought her three months ago			1
mr @entity7 said : ' she just never keeps still			0
you can tell she ’s clever			0
' i thought hamsters were supposed to be quite quiet and slept all day , but she is always on the go			0
