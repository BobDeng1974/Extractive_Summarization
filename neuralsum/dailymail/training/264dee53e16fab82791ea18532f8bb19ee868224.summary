since leaving office in 2007 , @entity0 has made millions by giving paid speeches and advising buisinesses as @entity0 distances himself from @entity7 , it has already cozied up to another likely 2016 presidential candidate that takes a more favorable approach to the health care reform law : @entity182			1

@entity0 's previous business dealings will certainly come up in the presidential race should he proceed with his candidacy , and his relationship with @entity7 is already being called his ' @entity4 problem			1
' but @entity223 , the former chairman of the @entity224 who headed the @entity1 @entity47 at the time that @entity0 was in office , told the @entity18 this week that he did n't think @entity0 's business associations would ultimately blemish his candidacy			1
