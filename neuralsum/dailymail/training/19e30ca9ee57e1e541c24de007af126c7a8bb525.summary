pop star @entity0 today accused a @entity2 shadow minister of being a ' classist gimp ' after he attacked the number of posh actors and musicians			1
@entity2 mp @entity7 claimed @entity9 culture was ' dominated by @entity10 and @entity0 and their ilk ' who went to expensive boarding schools			1
the remarks , which come in the wake of @entity10 's best actor @entity18 nomination last week , sparked a furious response from the ' @entity22 ' chart star – who accused mr @entity7 of being a ' prejudiced wazzock ' who uses the ' politics of jealousy ' to win votes			1
i happened to go to a boarding school			2
no one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business			2
i bought my first guitar with money i saved from holiday jobs ( sandwich packing ! )			2
i was taught the only four chords i know by a friend			2
no one at school had any knowledge or contacts in the music business , and i was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker			2
so alien was it , that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business , and certainly no one was of any use			2
in the army , again , people thought it was a mad idea			2
none of them knew anyone in the business either			2
and when i left the army , going against everyone 's advice , everyone i met in the @entity9 music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because i was too posh			1
one record company even asked if i could speak in a different accent			2
( i told them i could try @entity77 )			2
every step of the way , my background has been against me succeeding in the music business			2
and when i have managed to break through , i was still scoffed at for being too posh for the industry			2
and then you come along , looking for votes , telling working class people that posh people like me do n't deserve it , and that we must redress the balance			0
but it is your populist , envy - based , vote - hunting ideas which make our country crap , far more than me and my shit songs , and my plummy accent			1
i got signed in @entity97 , where they do n't give a stuff about , or even understand what you mean by me and ' my ilk ' , you prejudiced wazzock , and i worked my arse off			1
what you teach is the politics of jealousy			1
rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the @entity97 do , you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and ' level the playing field '			0
perhaps what you 've failed to realise is that the only head - start my school gave me in the music business , where the @entity117 majority of people are not from boarding school , is to tell me that i should aim high			1
perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow - minded , self - defeating , lead - us - to - a - dead - end , remove - the - ' g ' - from - ' gb ' thinking , which is to look at others ' success and say , ' it 's not fair			1
' up yours , @entity0 in a letter to mr @entity7 , @entity2 's shadow culture minister , @entity0 says the boarding school he attended in @entity132 , in @entity133 , did nothing to help him break into the music industry			1
the 40 - year - old @entity137 award - winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh			1
@entity0 opens his letter to mr @entity7 by accusing him of being a ' classist gimp ' , despite the fact that the @entity2 mp himself was privately educated at £ 20,000 a year @entity145 before attending @entity146			1
in @entity0 's letter , he writes : ' i happened to go to a boarding school			1
no one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business			0
' he adds : ' i bought my first guitar with money i saved from holiday jobs ( sandwich packing ! )			0

' @entity2 mp @entity7 ( left ) - privately educated himself - claimed @entity9 culture was ' dominated by @entity10 ( right ) and @entity0 and their ilk ' who went to expensive boarding schools @entity0 stop being so blooming precious			1
i 'm not knocking your success			0
i even contributed to it by buying one of your albums			0
i 'm not knocking @entity10 , either			1
he was the best @entity183 i have ever seen			0
if you 'd read the whole of my interview , you 'd have seen that i make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves			0
of course that includes you			0
but it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills			0
i 'm delighted you 've done well for yourself			0
but it is really tough forging a career in the arts if you ca n't afford the enormous fees for drama school , if you do n't know anybody who can give you a leg up , if your parents ca n't subsidise you for a few years whilst you make your name and if you ca n't afford to take on an unpaid internship			0
you see the thing is i want everyone to take part in the arts			0
i do n't want any no - go areas for young people from less privileged backgrounds			1
and i 'm convinced that we wo n't be @entity215 if we waste great @entity9 talent in the arts			0
you seem to think talent will always out			0
my fear is that someone like @entity220 , the son of a disabled miner in the @entity222 , who rose to be one of @entity215 's greatest film actors ( @entity225 ) , would have found it even harder to make it today			1
that 's why we need more diversity at every level in the arts – in education , in training , on - screen , on stage and backstage – and we need to break down all the barriers to taking part so that every talent gets a chance			1
yours bluntly @entity7 @entity0 said even in the army , which he joined after university , he was told that trying to become a pop star was a ' mad idea '			1
he writes : ' and when i left the army , going against everyone 's advice , everyone i met in the @entity9 music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because i was too posh			1
