' if you want to stay friends with your ex , relationship expert and author of the dating game @entity259 says there are several things to consider			1
@entity263 of the list is your feelings for them but you also need to consider why you want to be friends and whether you can handle not having sex with them			1
here are her top tips ... 1			0
consideration for each others ' feelings during the break - up is one of the most important things you can do to try and stay friends afterwards			1
a relationship that ends in recriminations and hostility is far less likely to succeed friendship-wise post splitting up			1
do n't think about having sex with your ex. however close you may have become since your relationship ended , this is likely to complicate things			1
allow your ex-partner to be angry for a while , especially if you were the one to initiate the break			0
it 's a necessary and healthy part of getting through the process			0
breaking up and still hanging out together all the time and seeing mutual friends as if you were still a couple may give your ex-partner false hope of a reconciliation			1
however hurt you feel , do n't be tempted to place all the blame for the split on your partner			0
a little soul - searching and letting yourself shoulder some of the responsibility , however difficult that seems at first , is important for both of you to be able to move on as friends			1

while the celebrity world is no stranger to couples who managed to make things work following a split , not every a-lister has been so lucky ... @entity339 and @entity340 actress @entity339 and model @entity342 , who are parents to a daughter named @entity345 , were at the centre of one of the most acrimonious splits in celebrity history in 2010			1
after the pair , who dated for five years , broke up @entity339 moved on , eventually marrying @entity353 actor , @entity354			0
but when the new couple tried to move to his native @entity353 things turned nasty			0
