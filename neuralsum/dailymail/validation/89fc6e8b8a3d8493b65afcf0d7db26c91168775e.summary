not the sweetest strike you ’ll see			0
not the sweetest strike of the game , in fact			0
but @entity6 ’s tentative prod which squirmed past goalkeeper @entity7 and trickled into the net was like a shot of nectar for @entity11			1
@entity12 may one day reflect on this late contribution from a striker he has rarely used as the moment when self - doubt was allayed and the @entity18 title was secured			1
having been 2 - 0 up inside nine minutes at @entity19 , courtesy of @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity11 had to prove they could banish this habit of throwing away the lead			1
but their not - so - reliable - anymore defence wobbled and creaked			0
@entity6 strokes home the winner at the @entity27 to give @entity11 a 3 - 2 victory against @entity19 on sunday afternoon the @entity30 striker celebrates with team - mate @entity31 after his goal saw the @entity34 extend their lead at the top of the @entity18 @entity6 ran over to the touchline to celebrate with the @entity11 staff as @entity12 dishes out instructions to his team @entity6 's effort squirmed under the legs of @entity19 goalkeeper @entity7 to give @entity11 the three points @entity45 capitalises on @entity47 ' mistake to get @entity19 back on level terms against @entity11 on sunday the young @entity50 goalkeeper tried to dribble past @entity51 with the ball but it fell to @entity19 striker @entity45 @entity47 looks dejected after his error during the first half of the @entity18 fixture at the @entity27 @entity47 apologises to his @entity11 team - mates after his mistake lead to an @entity45 equaliser @entity19 : @entity7 5.5 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 7.5 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 6 ( @entity67 80 6 ) , @entity51 6.5 ( @entity68 80 6 ) , @entity69 6.5 ( @entity70 81 6 ) , @entity71 6.5 , @entity45 7			1

it was still 2 - 2 as the clock ticked towards 77 minutes and @entity83 rolled a pass to @entity85 on the @entity11 right			1
@entity85 found @entity6 and the substitute , only on for a few seconds after replacing the injured @entity22 , jabbed it towards @entity7 , who was clearly expecting something else entirely because he was wrong - footed , unable to recover , and the ball slithered over the line			1
a thrilling game was settled by a scruffy goal and @entity11 ’s cushion at the top of the table was plumped			1
‘ i ’m pretty confident , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ we got what we deserved			0
we have a six - point lead , one match in hand and eight matches to go for our opponents			2
they can make 24 points			0
i believe in my players			0
’ @entity12 looks disgruntled on the bench after watching his premier leaders throw away a two - goal lead in the first half @entity64 netted @entity19 's first goal to give them a route back into the match at the @entity27 the @entity142 wing - back runs back to the halfway line and is congratulated by his team - mates after his strike @entity21 put @entity11 in front with a fine strike from outside the box within two minutes on sunday afternoon hazard jumps for joy after his fine strike put @entity12 's side into the lead in @entity19 they had made such a brilliant start at the @entity27 , where @entity21 lashed in a beauty after only 78 seconds			1
collecting a lay - off from @entity22 , he drove diagonally across the pitch before firing the ball back across goal with his left foot			1
from outside the penalty area , it sailed beyond @entity7 ’s dive			0
even early on @entity11 ’s frailties were in evidence			2
@entity45 was through and ought to have equalised			2
played onside by @entity79 , he collected a flick from @entity169 , but could not beat @entity47 who blocked with his body			2
when @entity22 made it 2 - 0 , the contest seemed to be settled			1
again , it was a splendid goal , lashed past poor @entity7 from an angle			0
for the £ 32million @entity11 striker , it was his 20th of the season			2
the goal - rate has slowed since the turn of the year , and his temper simmered , as ever			2
there was a confrontation with @entity183 , when @entity22 accused the @entity19 manager ’s son of swiping his legs away , and a flashpoint when @entity65 claimed to have been elbowed in his face			1
referee @entity96 did not see the ‘ elbow ’ , as he had not seen @entity22 ’s stamp on @entity192 during the @entity191 semi-final			2
the pair have history going back to @entity22 ’s first game in @entity198 football when the same referee booked him for a dive at @entity201			0
@entity19 reacted after a tactical switch from manager @entity62 , who started with three at the back and moved to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation after going two down			1
the change did not stop left back @entity69 charging forward to create the first with a low cross , bundled in by @entity64			0
within two minutes , the home team were level and panic descended on @entity11 at the back as they struggled to cope with a mixture of high balls and intense pressing			0
@entity47 made a poor decision to take a touch on a back - pass from @entity79			1
the goalkeeper twisted past @entity51 , who was closing in , but his touch was too heavy , the ball rolled to @entity45 for a simple finish			0
@entity22 doubled the visitor 's advantage with a fine curing effort past @entity19 goalkeeper @entity7 into the corner @entity22 is embraced by team - mates @entity84 and @entity82 after his strike at the @entity27 the @entity229 international striker looks bemused by the corner flag after a decision does n't go his way on sunday @entity22 endured a frustrating game after his goal and was eventually substituted eventual goalscorer @entity6 came on for @entity22 in the second half as @entity11 pressed for a winner after the break , @entity11 were brighter			1
@entity12 tweaked his midfield shape , sent on @entity31 and controlled possession but @entity19 defended well and limited the visitors to long - range efforts			2
@entity47 then produced his incredible triple save to thwart @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity51 , each flying stop better than the one before , and perhaps it energised his team to search for the winner			0
even when @entity22 headed down the tunnel with the medics , @entity11 kept probing			1
@entity6 restored the lead and this time they did not surrender it			2
it was @entity6 ’s sixth goal since an £ 8.5million move from @entity254			2
‘ he probably deserves more than i gave him , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ there are not many times when a coach can feel he owes something to a player but with @entity6 that ’s the case			0
every time he plays he gives us a lot and he has never complained			0
