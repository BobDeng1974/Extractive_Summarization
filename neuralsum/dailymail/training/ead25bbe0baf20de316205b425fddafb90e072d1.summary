by @entity0 nearly 170 victims of child sex trafficking , many of whom had never been reported missing , were rescued in the last week as part of an annual nationwide crackdown , the @entity1 said monday			1
besides the 168 children rescued from the sex trade , 281 pimps were arrested during the same period on state and federal charges			1
' these are not faraway kids in faraway lands , ' fbi director @entity14 said in announcing the annual enforcement push known as @entity19			1
instead , he added , ' these are @entity21 's children			0
' scroll down for @entity22 ' these are @entity21 's children ' : fbi director @entity14 announces the child sex trafficking sting from the bureau 's headquarters in @entity27 on monday this is the eighth such week - long operation , which this year unfolded in 106 cities			1
the @entity1 says nearly 3,600 children have so far been recovered from the street			2
' i hate that we have to do this work — hate it , ' @entity14 said			2
' i love the people who 've devoted their lives to doing this work			0
there is no more meaningful work that the @entity1 participates in than rescuing children			2
' he said the operations were designed to ' crush these pimps ' and show that children are not for sale			0
they are also intended to rescue children who are being trafficked on street corners , in truck stops and , increasingly , on the @entity50 , where pimps advertise and arrange sexual encounters			1
one challenge , officials said , is that many of the children who were recovered were never reported missing in the first place — by parents , guardians and the entire child welfare system designed to protect them			2
rescued : in the monday press conference , @entity14 said that the bureau had rescued 168 children and arrested 281 pimps			1
he reported that the pimps sold the children online , at truck stops and on the street ' no one is reporting them missing			1
hence , no one is looking for them , ' said @entity73 , ceo of the @entity74			0
' but for operations like this , these children likely would never have been found			0
' he said better laws were needed to require child welfare service to report children who disappear			0
right now , he said , only two states have laws requiring agencies to report children missing from their care			0
there is no national , uniform standard			0
' we can not find them if no one reports them missing , ' @entity73 said			0
though this operation is the @entity1 's eighth of its kind , @entity14 said this year featured the highest number of participating cities			1
but he said the biggest change was the increasing prevalence of children being sold online rather than on street corners .			2
