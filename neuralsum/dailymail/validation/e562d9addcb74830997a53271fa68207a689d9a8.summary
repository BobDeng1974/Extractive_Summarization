when it comes to living on @entity2 , there ’s one major problem that will affect future astronauts : oxygen , or rather , a lack thereof			1
but an instrument called @entity8 - the @entity2 oxygen in - situ @entity9 - could provide a solution			1
it will attempt to turn carbon dioxide on @entity2 into oxygen when it is taken to the red planet by a new @entity17 rover in 2020 - and it could be a precursor to similar technologies on manned misisons			1
the @entity20 is creating an instrument for @entity2			1
called @entity8 ( shown here in this illustration ) it will attempt to turn the planet 's carbon dioxide into oxygen			1
it will be taken to the red planet by a new unnamed @entity17 rover in 2020 speaking to @entity30 , former astronaut and principle investigator for the instrument dr @entity29 explained the project			1
‘ it will be the first time when we will actually produce oxygen on the surface of @entity2 , ’ he said			0
this next - gen vehicle is the successor to the @entity42 , with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine @entity2 ' rocks			0
the rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of @entity2 life			0
it will identify and collect a collection of rock and soil samples , which it will be able to send back to @entity57 intact , via another spacecraft one day in the future			0
dr @entity60 , director of @entity17 's @entity61 , has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to @entity57 is @entity17 's top priority			0
scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by @entity2 dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to @entity2 and the future colonisation of the planet			2
the rover marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity76 's challenge of sending humans to @entity2 in the 2030s			2
the atmosphere of @entity2 is 96 per cent carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 per cent oxygen , but the team hope to convert the former into 99.6 per cent pure oxygen			1
to do so , it gathers carbon dioxide from its surroundings and isolates oxygen atoms , then combines them to make @entity90 - breathable air			2
on this occasion , together with the by - product of carbon monoxide , the gases will be released back into the air			0
but proving the technology works would have important implications for future missions - and not just for breathable air , but fuel as well			0
‘ ultimately , the idea is that @entity17 would send both an empty rocket and a larger version of @entity8 to @entity2 , before a planned human mission , ’ writes @entity100 for @entity30			2
‘ the oxygen - producing machine would take about a year and a half to fill the rocket with enough liquid oxygen for lift off			0
‘ then , when astronauts arrived , they would have a rocket fueled up and ready for launch to take them home			0
’ @entity17 ’s @entity2 2020 rover is a planned £ 1.2 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) roving laboratory , similar to the @entity42 currently on the planet			1
@entity8 was selected from 58 instrument proposals from research teams around the world			0
if the technology can be proven , it would greatly reduce the weight of a future mission to @entity2 - 75 per cent of a manned @entity2 mission would be taken up by oxygen , or equipment carrying it			2
the atmosphere of @entity2 is 96 per cent carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 per cent oxygen , but the team hope to convert the former into 99.6 per cent pure oxygen			1
this could then be used for breathable air on future manned missions ( illustrated ) or even fuel to get them off the surface @entity17 's 2020 rover ( illustrated ) is the successor to the @entity42 , with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine @entity2 ' rocks			1
the rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of @entity2 life			0

the @entity20 is creating a @entity2 instrument
called @entity8 it will attempt to turn the planet 's carbon dioxide into oxygen
it will be taken to the red planet by a new @entity17 rover in 2020
the atmosphere of @entity2 is 96 **%** carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 **%** oxygen
converting it could provide fuel and air for future manned missions
