discovery : @entity1 , 72 , discovered he is effectively the ' grandfather of everyone in @entity3 ' a dna test on a @entity6 pensioner has revealed he is a direct descendent of the first ever woman who lived on @entity9 190,000 years ago			1
@entity1 , 72 , discovered he is effectively the ' grandfather of everyone in @entity3 ' after he paid £ 200 to take the test to trace his ancestry			1
@entity3 's @entity4 , the research team who carried out the test , said the result means that mr @entity1 is ' the grandson of eve ' - the very first woman			1
the test results showed that mr @entity1 , a retired lecturer who lives in @entity18 near @entity19 , has a genetic marker , @entity20 , that can be followed back all the way to an ancient @entity23 lineage that has never before been found in @entity24			1
he has mitochondrial dna ( @entity26 ) which is passed through the female side is 30,000 years old and only two genetic mutations removed from the first ' black eve '			2
most men , the researchers say , have genes that have incurred around 200 mutations from the earliest humans			1
mr @entity1 also found that the @entity36 marker on the male side of his genetic make - up is @entity39 and he carries the same genes that is found in a quarter of all @entity42 men			1
he said : ' i have led an unremarkable life until now			0
' this is a real gobsmacker			0
i seem to carry a gene from @entity47 that arrived through the slave trade			0
' i have been researching the links between the slave trade and @entity51 , the area where the female side of my family came from			0
' @entity47 was part of my geography degree at @entity57 in 1959 , but i could n't have imagined anything like this			0
@entity60 , @entity62 's rector and historian , and @entity64 , a geneticist from @entity65 , were responsible for setting up the national study and uncovering the startling results of mr @entity1			1
mr @entity60 said : ' it is an astonishing result and means he could have been in the ' @entity69 '			2
' it is further proof that even white @entity72 are descended from a black eve			2
ancestors : mr @entity1 's parents @entity75 and @entity77 ' this lineage appears in @entity47 , in @entity79 , but has never been seen in north - west @entity24			1
' it is likely to have reached @entity3 through the arrival of slaves in @entity51			2
' a woman who might be called @entity73 and a man who might be called @entity85 really existed			0
' eve , the mother of us all , lived around 190,000 thousand years ago just as homo sapiens were evolving			0
other women lived at the same time but only @entity73 's @entity26 survived			0
' @entity85 also lived in @entity91 , perhaps only around 140,000 years ago			0
only his @entity36 survived to father all of the male lineages on earth			0
the aim behind @entity3 's dna is to try and make a ' family tree of @entity3 '			2
the nationwide study that has examined the dna of 2,000 people from all over the @entity3 has found that most participants ' genetic markers date back around 3,500 years ago to the days of the earliest @entity3 , @entity101 and even cave painters and hunter gatherers			1
the complete test results suggest 32 per cent of @entity3 men are descended from the original @entity3 , 12 per cent from ancient germanic lines , 11 per cent are hunter gatherers and 7 per cent are ancient @entity108 .			1
