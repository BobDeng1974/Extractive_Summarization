by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 21 november 2013 @entity2 consumes more anti-depressants than almost all our neighbours in @entity6 , an international study has found			1
the @entity2 has the seventh - highest prescribing rate for drugs such as @entity9 in the western world , with 71 daily doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011			1
this is almost double the 38 doses a day prescribed a decade earlier , according to the study by the @entity16 , which represents the world ’s industrialised nations			2
trend : @entity2 has a rising rate of anti-depressant use for drugs like prozac ( pictured ) and is among the highest users of the drugs in @entity6 and the western world the surge has led to concerns among some doctors that antidepressants are being overprescribed in @entity2			1
@entity30 @entity29 79 @entity31 78 @entity2 @entity32 58 * defined daily dose , per 1,000 people per day there has been a particular rise in the use of a family of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( @entity41 ) , like @entity9 and @entity42			1
there have been concerns that some of these drugs may be linked to suicide attempts among younger users			2
these ssris are taken by almost 4million people in the @entity2 every year			1
the @entity16 figures show @entity30 to have the highest prescribing rate , at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011 , up from 71 a decade earlier			1
behind @entity30 is @entity55 , then @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity31			1
the lowest levels are seen in @entity60 and @entity61			0
antidepressant use in the @entity2 is far higher than much of mainland @entity6			1
in @entity65 and @entity66 , for example , prescriptions are at only two thirds the level – at 50 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants			2
in @entity71 , the level is just 42 doses a day			0
a spokesman for the @entity16 said : ‘ the consumption of certain types of prescribed drugs has increased significantly since 2000 in the @entity2 , notably the consumption of antidepressants and antibiotics			1
‘ as in several other countries , the rise in consumption of antidepressants preceded the financial and economic crisis in 2008 , but consumption has continued to grow rapidly since then : it nearly doubled in the @entity2 between 2000 and 2011 , and is now well above the @entity16 average			1
‘ greater intensity and duration of treatments are some of the factors explaining the rise in antidepressant consumption in the @entity2 and other countries			1
’ the increases in antidepressant use has caused concern because rates of depression have not risen to the same extent – indicating that doctors may be prescribing the drugs unnecessarily for people will only mild depression			0
worry : experts fear that the use of antidepressants has risen far higher that rates of depression in @entity2 ( file picture ) the @entity16 said that rising consumption levels could be explained by the use of antidepressants in milder cases			2
‘ these extensions have raised concerns about appropriateness , ’ it said			0
dr @entity118 , of the @entity120 's department of mental health and substance abuse , said : ‘ the explosion of antidepressants you see in most countries reflects the fact that lots of people with moderate to severe depression are getting treatment – that 's a good thing			0
‘ but the negative thing is that a lot of people are getting antidepressants who should n't be getting them			0
doctors and healthcare providers should be able to recognise depression correctly so that those who need antidepressants get them and those with only mild cases do not get prescribed			0
’ professor @entity145 , consultant psychiatrist with the @entity146 in the @entity2 , said : ‘ antidepressants are widely oversubscribed to get rid of unhappiness			2
‘ they were not designed for that			0
@entity151 is part of the human condition			0
but real clinical depression does respond to antidepressants			0
and not to prescribe in these cases is to sentence an individual to a far longer illness than he or she need suffer			0
’ professor @entity160 , director of the @entity161 in the @entity2 , said the rise was a ‘ testament to the effective marketing by the pharmaceutical industry ’			2
‘ i also wonder if , in better - off countries , we do n’t have time to be depressed and seek chemical solutions to “ get rid of it ”			0
’ the @entity16 figures on antidepressants were contained in their health at a glance 2013 report , released yesterday			0
it also showed that @entity2 ’s cancer survival rates are on a par with @entity6 , and that our gps are the best paid in the western world .			1
