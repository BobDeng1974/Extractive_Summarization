@entity2 's decision to execute its @entity4 - linked prisoners in retaliation for the death of its pilot will only serve to fuel more revenge attacks by the terror group , a security analyst said today			1
the @entity10 hanged two jihadists this morning hours after vowing to avenge the death of @entity13 , who was shown being torched alive in a video released yesterday			1
@entity2 has also promised to follow through on a threat to execute four other prisoners convicted of being associated with @entity4			1
but while such an uncompromising strategy may have struck a chord with the @entity2 public , security experts have warned of the dangers of adopting an eye - for - an - eye response			1
@entity24 , a professor for defence studies at @entity26 in @entity27 , told @entity28 : ' the @entity2 response to the execution of their pilot was purely an act of blind revenge			1
' moreover , punishing jihadists by executing senior commanders will only cause revenge – something that @entity2 , a country under pressure , should try to avoid			1
' at its core , the @entity66 can still act with impunity			0
executing some @entity54 operatives who were only marginally related to the roots of @entity4 is not going to change this			2
' this round goes to @entity4			2
@entity2 puts itself on the same level by letting anger and hatred prevail over justice			2
' the gruesome death of 26 - year - old lt @entity79 , captured while participating in airstrikes by a @entity82 - led coalition , sparked outrage and anti-islamic state group demonstrations in @entity2			1
newspaper headlines warned @entity2 ' will take revenge ' for his slaying as @entity38 , a staunch @entity89 ally , rushed back to his kingdom from @entity91			1
in its first response , @entity2 executed @entity47 and @entity95 , two @entity48 linked to @entity54 , government spokesman @entity92 said			1
@entity2 has executed two @entity4 - linked prisoners including @entity47 ( left ) hours after militants released a sickening video that showed captured @entity2 fighter pilot @entity13 ( right ) being burned alive @entity47 ( pictured inside a military court in 2006 ) and @entity49 , have already been executed after @entity2 promised a swift and lethal response to the brutal @entity4 video @entity66 had demanded @entity47 's release in exchange for the life of @entity107 journalist @entity106			1
however , @entity106 was later beheaded by the group , with images of his death released in a video last saturday			0
@entity2 had insisted that they would only release the woman as part of a deal to free the pilot , who , it has since emerged was killed a month ago making a mockery of any negotiations			1
dr @entity24 added : ' this act of vengeance by the @entity2 king is really not a sign of strength			1
it is an act of weakness			0
' ( the executions ) are a desperate attempt by @entity38 to show strength to an outraged public that has been unusually vocal in their criticism of the palace 's dealing with the hostage situation			1
' after agreeing to negotiate the execution of the pilot , which already happened a month ago , it is a slap in the @entity122 's face			2
' @entity4 demonstrated that they can stage an execution in this manner in their capital @entity144 while appearing untouchable			2
' some analysts also believe @entity2 could escalate its involvement in the campaign against @entity66 , which has seized large areas of @entity48 and @entity150 , @entity2 's neighbours to the north and east			1
brutal : the footage , which is titled ' healing the @entity154 ' , shows the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight depraved : the flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot			0
it is later flattened by a bulldozer the latest murder by @entity66 terrorists represents a new level of barbarity from a group notorious for its savagery			0
as with previous beheading videos , footage of @entity13 ’s murder is characterised by its slick production values and graphics			0
but unlike the others , it contains an added cinematic dimension clearly designed to achieve heightened impact – as if the horror of burning alive was n’t enough			0
@entity4 blames the fighter pilot for burning houses and killing babies with airstrikes before he was captured in december			1
the manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into ‘ non-believers ’ and encourage doubters within their ranks			0
and while the beheading videos featuring @entity198 executioner @entity197 were often static – showing the terrorist standing behind his victims – this clip combines aerial shots , panoramic views and changing camera angles that would have taken far longer to edit			0
reports from @entity2 suggest @entity205 may have died as long ago as january 3 , suggesting the video has been a month in the making			2
the new clip also contains more of the landscape than has previously been shown , which intelligence experts will analyse for clues as to the jihadists ’ whereabouts			0
it is the latest in a propaganda war in which the terror group seem intent on finding new ways to provoke horror and disgust			0
as well as posting footage of executions on social media , they have also used captured @entity198 photojournalist @entity224 – who is still believed to be alive – to present videos attacking the @entity226			0
in @entity91 , @entity38 and president @entity227 vowed in a hastily arranged @entity229 meeting tuesday not to let up in the fight against the @entity66 group			2
@entity38 has portrayed the campaign against the extremists as a battle over values			2
in a speech later aired on @entity2 state television , he urged his countrymen to unite			2
' it 's the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of @entity2 in the face of these hardships , ' @entity38 said			1
@entity82 representative @entity244 , a @entity246 @entity245 , said after a meeting with congressional lawmakers and @entity38 that the @entity2 monarch had been visibly angry and promised swift and certain retaliation against @entity66 group militants			1
' they 're starting more sorties tomorrow than they 've ever had			0
' they 're starting tomorrow , ' @entity254 told the @entity256 in an interview published online tuesday night			0
@entity254 added the king also said : ' the only problem we 're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets			1
' that uncompromising response will strike the right chord with his own people , who were shocked over the brutality of @entity4 's latest execution video			1
but dr @entity269 , a @entity2 political analyst once threatened with prosecution for criticising the @entity122 , says this commitment to engaging with @entity4 may wane before too long			1
he told @entity272 's today programme : ‘ the initial effect is that there is a massive feeling of anger and solidarity amongst the people of @entity2 against @entity4			1
' but you can not count on this as time passes because initially @entity2 was severely divided over this particular issue and a good number of them feel this is not our war , we should not be involved			2
‘ lots of people would n’t be willing to express this position now because they might be labelled as anti-patriotic			0
' he said the decision to join the airstrikes did not come out of public debate or consultation			0
he added : ' @entity122 made the decision and the @entity122 knows and only he knows exactly why @entity2 is involved in this fight			2
‘ personally i do n’t think our involvement would lead to anything or mean anything			0
it ’s symbolic involvement but its repercussions are immense			0
‘ i think @entity4 itself knows that what ’s taking place is funny , not serious			2
@entity308 never won a war against paramilitary organisations			0
‘ they will continue to grow as long as there ’s enough grievances and anger among people in the region			0
president @entity227 ( right ) met late last night with @entity38 in the @entity316 of the @entity229 , hours after the @entity13 was executed he was escorted under heavy security through a basement corridor at the @entity319 after meeting with the @entity320 and other leaders in @entity91 ‘ i would not support [ further air strikes ]			1
it would lead to nothing			0
@entity2 is far too weak			2
' @entity2 ’s political position is far more important			2
if it put an end to the supply route to @entity150 across @entity2 that could be more effective			0
’ after word spread that the pilot had been killed , dozens of people chanting slogans against the @entity332 marched toward the royal palace to express their anger			0
waving a @entity2 flag , they chanted , ' damn you , @entity340 ! ' - using the @entity342 acronym of the group - and ' we will avenge , we will avenge our son 's blood			1
' ' there is no religion accepts such act , ' @entity52 resident @entity347 said			0
' @entity351 is a religion of tolerance			0
( the @entity66 group ) have nothing to do with @entity351			0
' protesters also marched in the pilot 's home village of @entity360 and set a local government office on fire			1
witnesses said the atmosphere was tense and that riot police patrolled the streets			0
@entity367 is from a tribal area in southern @entity2 's @entity370 district			1
the tribes are considered a mainstay of support for the monarchy , but the pilot 's capture has strained that relationship			1
members of the pilot 's family have repeatedly accused the government of botching efforts to win his release and have also criticized @entity2 's participation in the anti-islamic state group alliance			1
@entity2 faces increasing threats from the militants			0
@entity2 borders areas of islamic state group 's self - declared caliphate			1
there also have been signs of greater support for the group 's militant ideas among @entity2 's young and poor			2
@entity397 , a former @entity398 adviser on the @entity399 , said he believes the pilot 's killing could backfire , antagonising @entity402 against the extremists , including @entity402 tribes in @entity48			1
he also said the extremist group 's recent military setbacks may have fueled the killings			0
' they need to compensate for that with increasingly gruesome killings of prisoners , ' said @entity397 , director of the program on peace - building and human rights at @entity415 .			0

@entity10 hanged @entity4 - linked prisoners after vowing to avenge pilot 's death
@entity399 security analysts warn of dangers of eye - for - an - eye response
dr @entity24 told @entity28 : ' the executions will only cause revenge '
@entity2 @entity38 ' vows to conduct more airstrikes against @entity4 '
he said : ' the only problem we *'ll* have is running out of fuel and bullets '
