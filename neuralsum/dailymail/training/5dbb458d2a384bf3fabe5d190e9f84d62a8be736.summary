by @entity0 published : 20:15 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 07:03 est , 13 march 2014 @entity2 was left raging after some ' shocking decisions ' from referee @entity4 in their @entity6 clash with @entity7			1
@entity8 were knocked out in the last 16 thanks to goals from @entity11 and @entity12 , but @entity2 , who was sent off , says three key decisions did not go his side 's way			2
@entity2 felt that there was a foul in the build up to @entity7 's first goal , that @entity8 deserved a penalty and he insists he should not have been dismissed			1
off you go : @entity2 was sent off for a second booking for disputing a penalty appeal with the referee ' it was very clear - @entity26 came from behind and made the tackle on @entity28 , and the referee was only two metres away			1
he saw that very clearly , ' said @entity2			0
' it was also a foul against @entity28 just before @entity7 ’s first goal			2
he held the ball and turned , and @entity26 had hold of his shirt , and the ref gave a free - kick to @entity7			1
' sometimes in the game you are nervous because you are trying to get the result , and sometimes shocking decisions by the ref make you a bit angry			0
' i do n’t know why i got a red card because i went to him to talk in a good way			0
i was a little bit angry to him because he did n’t give the penalty but i was always respectful to him			0
' i am very frustrated at the decision because it was a shocking decision			0
i am disappointed but also very proud of the team because i think we played a fantastic game			0
' frustration : @entity2 reacts after @entity11 's opening goal at the @entity58 in the middle : @entity4 ( right ) made a number of poor decisions on both sides on wednesday night appeal : @entity64 looked to have brought @entity11 down inside the area after eight minutes @entity4 also missed what should have been a penalty for @entity7 , when @entity64 fouled @entity11 in the first half			1
the officials also wrongly judged @entity70 to be offside and subsequently ruled out @entity72 's goal from his cut - back			0
in the first leg there was controversy when @entity77 awarded @entity7 a penalty even though @entity79 seemed to foul @entity11 just outside the box			2
@entity81 was on the touchline for @entity8 on wednesday night , after @entity83 was punished by @entity84 for his comments about the referee after that game			2
great chance : @entity89 looks furious with himself after missing an opportunity after half - time jubilant : @entity11 celebrates with his team - mates after giving the hosts the lead on the night unfortunate : @entity7 wrongly had a @entity72 disallowed for offside early on in or out ? @entity79 conceded a penalty in the first leg despite his tackle looking outside the area no say : @entity8 's manager @entity83 looked on from the stands as he serves his touchline ban			1

@entity2 sent off for arguing with referee @entity4
