@entity1 's new era at @entity2 is underway and @entity3 showed why he may have a big part to play in it			1
the 20 - year - old is likely to get some opportunities to play alongside @entity7 at the start of the season , unless @entity11 's four - month ban is revoked			2
in that time he will be aiming to impress enough to be a real alternative for @entity1 and his quest began on saturday night when he helped @entity2 win the @entity14			1
@entity2 : @entity49 ( @entity50 46 ) ; @entity51 ( @entity52 46 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 46 ) , @entity55 ( @entity19 46 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 46 ) ; @entity58 ( @entity59 46 ) , @entity60 ( @entity22 46 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 46 , ( @entity63 70 ) ) ; @entity64 ( @entity15 46 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 46 ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 46 )			1
it was @entity3 's low strike which was parried by @entity28 to the waiting @entity22 , who gleefully turned it home from close - range to net the first goal of @entity1 's reign			1
@entity3 had beaten two men with a quick dribble before making some space for his shot , showing he has the attributes to unlock the defences that so readily retreat into their own box against @entity2			2
with two minutes to go he could have scored himself , lashing the ball past @entity29 from a tight angle , but seeing it come crashing back off the crossbar			0
there was a modicum of pressure to perform on his shoulders , after he was spotted earlier in the week mocking a @entity18 goal celebration			0
elements of his game are similar to the @entity96 star 's , with the forward , on loan at @entity100 last season , offering plenty of stepovers			0
he also lured @entity38 into an ungainly lunge , hacking down @entity3 and ending up in the referee 's notebook			0
@entity106 of foot : @entity15 in action for @entity100 in the @entity109 while on loan last season pedigree : the @entity113 graduate shoots towards goal during @entity115 's friendly against @entity116 in may back from injury : @entity68 vies for possession with @entity24 midfielder @entity38 in the 50th edition of the @entity14 , a tournament set up by @entity24 to commemorate their position as @entity115 's oldest club , @entity2 were worthy winners			1
this game marked @entity24 's 125th anniversary , but they could not do themselves justice with @entity1 's side firmly in control in the @entity129 heat			1
although the game featured plenty of youth players there were a few hints of what was to follow from @entity1			2
the team played a more fluid style than last season , with less of the diagonal , longer balls that @entity140 favoured			0
in the first half @entity141 starlet @entity58 was the best player on show			1
@entity2 fought off interest from @entity96 , @entity145 and @entity146 to secure their man and we saw why , with his fantastic technique obvious from the start			0
deep in thought : @entity1 looks on during @entity2 's friendly win over @entity24 likes a change : @entity1 walks out for the second half after making eleven changes at the break there are shades of @entity159 about @entity58 , but he plays with a more aggressive attacking style			1
one superbly hit half - volley from the edge of the box forced @entity29 into a smart save at his near post , and another clever nutmeg had the crowd purring			0
with @entity58 pulling the strings in midfield and @entity170 's direct running worrying the @entity24 defence , @entity2 looked in fine fettle			1
goalkeeper @entity173 had a couple of shaky moments early on with some poor kicks , which he will not be pleased with , given @entity1 's words about giving him a chance			1
the manager said that even though @entity50 and @entity181 had been signed , all three goalkeepers would start the season on an even footing			0
@entity181 is still on holiday after his @entity186 exertions with @entity187 , but the @entity188 came on at half - time and was solid			0
easy first - half : @entity2 's @entity188 goalkeeper @entity50 poses with a fan while on the bench in action : @entity50 came on for the second half and looked comfortable for the visitors casual : @entity1 urges his team forward in the second half of their win on saturday evening while he did not have any saves to make , he was quick off his line and showed good control on the ball			1
another impressive performer was the @entity207 @entity68 , who may not have a role to play at @entity2 this season			0
@entity210 and @entity211 were injured and not part of the squad , while @entity214 was not selected - perhaps an indication he has a move away lined up			0
@entity60 , who recently signed a new contract , captained the side entirely composed of @entity220 graduates			0
it was all - change after the break , with 11 players brought on at half - time , including @entity15 and @entity68			2
@entity3 will hope this was the start of things to come and , with @entity2 lifting silverware at the end of the match , so will @entity1			2
late sub : @entity2 's @entity231 forward @entity63 battles past @entity35 in closing stages			2

@entity22 scored the winner midway through the second half in @entity24
the friendly was new @entity2 boss @entity1 's first match at the helm
the @entity14 match marked @entity24 's 125th anniversary
@entity2 named a very young side , with *highly* - rated @entity141 midfielder @entity58 startin
@entity1 named an entirely different line - up for the second half of the game
the @entity26 was one of those *introduced* at the break
@entity2 's new goalkeeper @entity50 also played the second half
@entity257 impressed out wide for the visitors
