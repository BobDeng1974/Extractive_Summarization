that match was as good as over by half - time as @entity0 stormed into a 20 - 6 lead as they banished the memories of last weekend 's scrappy 6 - 0 win in the second test with an impressive showing			2
@entity14 's third - minute penalty set the hosts on their way and they were 10 - 0 ahead inside eight minutes thanks to newcomer @entity11			0
the giant 22 - year - old , who was drafted into starting line - up in place of former @entity0 captain @entity62 , showed his considerable power as he barged his way past the challenge of @entity2 flanker @entity66 to crash over from 12 yards out			0
@entity2 full - back @entity26 got his side off the mark with a penalty but @entity14 responded with another three - pointer of his own and then @entity0 took advantage of the yellow card shown to @entity74 to further increase their lead			0
defeat : sorry @entity2 could do little to respond to @entity0 's dominance , scoring a solitary try done : the match was a good as over by half - time as @entity0 stormed into a 20 - 6 lead a regular sight : @entity7 celebrates scoring his try during the third test between @entity0 and @entity2 prop @entity74 was sin - binned in the 27th minute for tackling without the ball and within a minute of his departure @entity0 claimed their second try , @entity7 stretching over in the corner after play had been quickly spread out to the right			2
@entity14 added his second successful conversion to make it 20 - 3 and , although @entity94 hit back for @entity2 with a penalty just before half - time , the @entity0 were in total control at the break			0
and that dominance continued in the second half with @entity101 's men further increasing their lead inside two minutes as @entity7 crossed for the second time in the match - and the 13th time in @entity104 - when he capitalised on good work from @entity11 to storm through the heart of the @entity2 defence and touch down			2
keep it up : @entity0 's dominance stretched further into the second half as @entity2 fell at their feet leader : @entity0 captain @entity12 holds up the @entity113 after beating @entity2 flanker @entity12 added a fourth @entity0 try on the hour mark after more quick handling and incisive running saw the @entity0 cut through the middle , with @entity14 adding the extras to make it 34 - 6			1
@entity2 finally had something to smile about in the 65th minute when they pulled a try back through @entity36 , who was powered over by a driving maul , but @entity0 had the last word when replacement @entity13 notched his maiden @entity84 try late on after catching @entity2 cold with a quickly - taken tap penalty			0
