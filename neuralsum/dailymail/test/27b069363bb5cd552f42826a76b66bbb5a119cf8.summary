i could n’t wait to get out of @entity1 , even though i loved the place			1
it was a holiday town , a place that would send you to sleep rather than drive you forward			2
maybe it was the sea air ; everything always manana			2
his team are anything but a team to send you to sleep			2
they are dynamic , full of hungry players , with a point to prove			2
i can tell you now that wide player @entity15 is a contender for my ‘ 10 to watch ’ for next season — he is dynamite			0
@entity6 raises his arms in triumph after @entity1 sealed @entity21 promotion ( left - right ) @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity6 , @entity24 and @entity25 celebrate and i ca n’t wait to see @entity25 in the top flight			1
he was on the back page of my @entity28 on tuesday morning and you can expect to see him there more often			0
he is like @entity31 , an exploding champagne bottle of a player ; shake him up and watch him fizz			0
@entity6 is the man who has got them buzzing			1
@entity36 asked if we have found ‘ the @entity38 ’ , but @entity6 is not the special one			1
watch @entity6 on the touchline and you will see he is the opposite to @entity44			1
@entity6 is peaceful during a game , relaxed , quiet and controlled			1
his extrovert assistant , @entity46 , provides the instructions and the demands , with @entity6 making his feelings known in a calm and gentle fashion			1
obviously the @entity21 will bring different demands for this young man , who is still only 37			0
@entity1 's players slide along the turf in delight after their dream came true on monday night we got to know each other after my dad signed him for @entity61 in 2002			1
he played only twice because of a knee injury that was similar to one that cost me my career			0
it eventually finished him , too , and while you do n’t want to make friends through the same devastating injury , i am glad i got to know him			0
some people you meet you can see are destined to be successful			2
he was always one of them			0
my dad liked him instantly and had a soft spot for him			0
i always thought my dad would be the king of @entity1 , for their @entity76 giantkilling of holders @entity77 in 1984 and their promotion success when he took them into what is now the @entity81			1
but @entity6 has blown away those achievements			1
lots of clubs will be admiring his progress and while he did n’t enjoy his experience at @entity88 when he left @entity1 in 2011 , that wo n’t stop others casting an eye in his direction			1
@entity94 ( left ) , @entity92 and @entity93 ( right ) toast the 3 - 0 win over @entity96 that secured promotion and why not ? he is impressive			1
he has a good eye for talent , makes big calls , plays young players , is forward - thinking , ambitious and looks the part — he is a chairman ’s dream			0
he will crave the opportunity to manage in the @entity21 and will enjoy recruiting new talent			0
@entity1 is a good place to bring up a family and he has also made it a good place to play			1
it is very different from the leaking stands and muddy pitch at @entity115 that i left behind			0
my childhood there was a big part of my life , cleaning @entity122 ’s boots , training with @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 and receiving my schooling in a football environment			0
but the away end had no roof and the old boys used to sit on wooden benches with cushions that they would throw at you when you were having a poor game			0
@entity136 believes @entity6 was destined for success as soon as got to know him in 2002 leaving for @entity138 at 17 , i could n’t get away fast enough			1
but now i ca n’t wait to get back there next season			0
i would never have thought all four of my clubs — @entity1 , @entity138 , @entity142 and @entity143 — would be in the same league			2
@entity6 is the reason for that			2
i wonder if we are seeing an @entity149 manager in the making here .			0

@entity1 secured promotion on monday with victory against @entity96
@entity6 has put @entity1 on *map* after leading them to top flight
@entity136 always believed @entity6 was destined for success
