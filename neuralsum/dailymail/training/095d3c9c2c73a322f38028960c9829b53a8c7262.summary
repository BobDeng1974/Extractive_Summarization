the @entity0 is experiencing a shortage of suicide bombers after dozens of fighters deserted the terror group or defected to rival militias			1
reports from inside the isis - stronghold of @entity8 claim that a rebellion among a ' martyrs battalion ' is a severe blow to the @entity13 leadership who recruit foreign fighters for their suicide operations			1
according to the respected @entity18 activists , @entity8 is being slaughtered silently , @entity13 has seen dozens of militants earmarked for suicide operations flee the battlefield or defect to other groups			1
the news comes after @entity13 was forced to admit defeat in the key battle for the northern @entity28 town of @entity29 , where it deployed many suicide bombers in what turned out to be a lost cause			1
recent @entity35 air strikes have also decimated @entity13 's leadership leaving its leader @entity37 short of experienced commanders			1
@entity62 's @entity61 said : ' there is great tension in @entity65 , where is group suffered many defections in the past few days , a source from within @entity46 has confirmed that most of defections are from suicide bombers , where these defections are considered a painful blow to the group			1
' he claims anyone caught deserting their position faces summary execution			1
he said the constant aerial bombardment and fierce fighting in @entity29 , the border town on the @entity82 border , has caused many foreign fighters and members of the suicide units to desert			2
@entity13 leaders select foreign jihadists for suicide missions because they usually arrive in @entity28 with little or no battlefield experience and so have no military value			1
according to one @entity13 insider who fled the group , special training camps have been set up inside @entity28 which filter out foreigners with no military experience and prepare them for suicide operations			1
@entity13 militants are seen being hit by an @entity100 airstrike on a hill just outside @entity29			1
the group have since ended their siege of the city after suffering significant losses a security source who works with @entity108 communities on combating extremism told @entity110 that he had been made aware of a number of @entity113 fighters who had been unprepared for the reality of @entity28 : ' the problem is that young @entity113 muslims who go over to @entity28 thinking they will be treated like equal brothers by @entity46 find out very quickly that they are being told to strap on suicide vets and prepare for @entity119 [ heaven ] ...			1
it 's hardly surprising that they have cold feet about these missions			2
' news of the defections comes just weeks after @entity13 was forced to pull out of the besieged @entity28 city of @entity29 after it became little more than a vortex of death for the terror group in the face of a brave resistance from thousands of @entity133 men and women			1
last month a senior @entity100 official said isis militants had started defying their commanders orders to venture inside the city , such was their fear of dying at the hands of @entity133 fighters			0
this reluctance to continue the fight to capture @entity29 eventually led to the terrorists withdrawing to villages in the suburbs , before @entity133 troops eventually forced them to pull back even further towards their strongholds elsewhere in northern @entity28			2
experts believe that @entity13 ' frequent displays of increasing savagery - including the recent burning alive of @entity152 pilot @entity150 - is simply the terror group attempting to distract from its territorial losses and present itself as a united front still capable of monstrous acts and oppression			1
abandoned : last month a senior @entity100 official said @entity13 militants had started defying their commanders orders to venture inside @entity29 ( pictured ) , such was their fear of dying at the hands of @entity133 fighters last october isis militants were seen raising their black flag on a hill close to @entity29 and the @entity82 border while @entity82 soldiers stood helpless in the foreground			2
@entity133 resistance troops have since torn down the flag and recaptured the hill in a symbolic victory compounding the problems , @entity13 has lost a number of high ranking commanders to sustained airstrikes from @entity178 and @entity179 warplanes in recent months			2
among the dead jihadis is @entity181 , a former @entity183 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity186 's number two and @entity13 ' most senior militant in @entity183			1
his death and that of as many as nine others on @entity13 ' 18 - man leadership council have forced @entity190 to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders , as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle - hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small			1
speaking to @entity110 , @entity197 from counter-extremism think tank @entity199 said : ' obviously @entity13 do get through quite a few suicide bombers but i think there 's always a risk that people will run off at the last minute			1
' ' i do think a lot of the talk of @entity0 being in decline is to an extent wishful thinking but it certainly is having a tougher time of things now , ' he said			0
' [ however ] there 's still a broad base of support in @entity183 and @entity216 is seen as the lesser of two evils by a significant amount of people who would n't want to return to the status quo , ' he added			0
' @entity29 was a great loss for @entity0 , it was a big symbolic loss			0
but losing @entity29 does n't mean that @entity0 is going to keep on losing everywhere			0
in its essence it is a nebulous entity - where it loses in one area , it can expand it another , ' mr @entity197 went on to say			2
' for example , as it has been rolled back in @entity183 , it has taken more territory in @entity28			0
that said it 's not storming across the country as it had been a few months ago and it is under much greater financial pressure now , given the price of oil , ' he added			0
blew himself up : at least three @entity113 jidhadists are known to have taken part in @entity13 suicide missions			1
@entity242 carried out the attack in the strategic @entity183 town of @entity245 last november first @entity113 suicide bomber : @entity249 ( pictured ) , aka the ' @entity248 bomber ' , was the first @entity113 militant to carry out a so - called ' martyrdom operation ' in @entity28 last february			1

shortly after the bombing mission extremist preacher @entity292 desribed @entity263 was ' a very dear brother '			0
he claimed @entity263 had been an active student and valued member of the banned extremist @entity295 organisation between 1996 and 2004 and had wanted to further the ' @entity108 cause '			0
comments : shortly after the suicide bombing mission extremist preacher @entity292 desribed @entity263 was ' a very dear brother @entity301 said @entity263 would organise his sermons in @entity248 and record the lectures and distribute them , adding : ' he was a good brother			0
he was someone who was always at hand to help people			0
' he wanted to study @entity306 and wanted to know what it was to be a good muslim			0
he was also very interested in the issue of how we could establish an @entity306 state			0
' in november @entity313 , from @entity314 , took part in a suicide bomb attack in the town of @entity318 , north of the @entity183 capital @entity320			0
shortly before the attack @entity313 had appeared on @entity322 , where he said that foreign fighters were volunteering for suicide missions and asking local commanders to be pushed up the list to become a suicide bomber			2
later that month @entity242 carried out the attack in the strategic @entity183 town of @entity245 , reportedly destroying a significant number of tanks and artillery equipment			0
a photo was released by @entity13 ' media branch for the province of @entity336 , showing @entity242 in full military uniform before his attack .			2

dozens of would - be suicide bombers left @entity13 before carrying out missions
terrorists have set up *roadblocks* and security checks to stop desertions
anyone *guilty* of desertion has been told they face summary execution
but the threats have not stopped jihadis defecting to other militant groups or fleeing the battlefield before carrying out their attacks
