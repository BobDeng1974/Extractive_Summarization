by @entity0 here 's one trucker who knows a thing or two about lane discipline			0
as the semi was being buffeted by high winds along a highway in @entity8 , the trucker managed to remain upright - but only just ! the big rig leaned more than 45 degrees over to the right , on the road near @entity12			1
the man was driving for @entity15 - based @entity14			1
the drama was captured by a driver who was traveling right behind the rig			2
@entity46 , owner and instructor at @entity48 , told @entity49 the driver of the semi did an outstanding job in keeping the rig from rolling over			1
' that driver deserves a medal , ' @entity46 said			2
' that was a great driving maneuver there			0
' saving the day : the driver rescues the rig by turning into the tilt and ' he did the only thing you could do , which was a perfect reaction to turn in the wind , ' @entity46 said			2
' there 's no way to actually teach that			0
' semis can easily tip over in the wind , especially when they 're empty			0
truck rollovers are the number one cause of fatalities for commercial drivers and it 's usually caused after drivers are thrown out of the vehicles			0
off - road : the truck turns off the highway and into a field after managing to stop the rig from toppling driving skills : amazingly thanks to luck and skill the driver manages to right the semi safe at last : the truck pulls off into a nearby field , the driver presumably , counting his blessings			1

an 18 - wheeler nearly flipped over in 50 - mile - per - hour winds on a @entity8 highway
driver behind the semi caught it all on video
