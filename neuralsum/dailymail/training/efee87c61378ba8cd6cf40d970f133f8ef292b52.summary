the pictures show the extraordinary lengths the medics will go to ensure the welfare of the powerful and dangerous mammals			1
dr @entity14 , 60 , oversaw the risky operation , where experts were trying out a new dosage of drugs on the beast			0
risky business : a dangerous lesson in how to safely give medicine to a two - tonne hungry hippo has been captured on camera by a vet deadly : hippos kill more people than any other animal in @entity29 while veterinary students looked on and took notes , a team of 12 people set about bringing the thrashing animal under control			1
the hulking hippo was first shot with a sedation dart , allowing the vets and gamekeepers to pull the blindfolded beast by rope towards the riverbank to carry out the procedure			1
the exercise was held to teach pupils how to safely give medicine to sick animals without putting themselves or the creatures in harm 's way			1
the vets used a new mixture of drugs to make the beast docile enough for people to get up close , but not so sleepy that the hippo would drown , a common problem in the past			1
they showed the students how to top - up the drug combination - to avoid the hippo regaining its senses and attacking the group - how to administer antibiotics and the method for injecting reversal drugs into the muscles under the hippo 's tongue to wake it up			2
air support : first the vets shoot the @entity72 with a tranquiliser from a helicopter a brave vet then carefully blindfolds the sedated animal caution : the blindfolded beast is roped ready to be led to the shore dr @entity14 , a senior lecturer at the faculty of veterinary science at the @entity82 , in @entity29 , said : ' hippos can be extremely dangerous and their teeth are lethal			2
' during the night they leave the water and travel up to 20 miles to feed			0
' people and communities who live by the riverbanks and who go to the water to wash and bathe can often bump into them as the hippos return in the morning			2
the team carefully guides the hippo to the riverbank for treatment ' @entity72 can be very aggressive and they are capable of chomping a person in half			1
' hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world and are responsible for more deaths in @entity29 than any other species			0
' on this occasion we had to be very careful			0
although the hippo was sedated it was still awake and could give you a nasty bite , ' dr @entity14 added			1
' there were also other hippos in the water and a few crocodiles about in there so we had to exercise extreme caution			0
treatment : the antibiotics are injected into the hippo @entity118 : reversal medicine is injected into the animal 's gums ' you can see from the pictures it is still awake and watching us			2
' we had to approach it from behind and put straps around its jaw			0
once this had been done we had a bit more freedom to move around			0
' by doing this it should help us treat the hippos without putting their lives in danger and it can help us to lead hippos away from situations where they come into close contact with humans			0
' this new combination of drugs is fantastic because it means we can safely treat the hippos without harming them and causing them to drown			0
' the hippo is guided back into the water ... ... and groggily goes on its way , with minor discomfort and with the vet team perfectly safe			2
