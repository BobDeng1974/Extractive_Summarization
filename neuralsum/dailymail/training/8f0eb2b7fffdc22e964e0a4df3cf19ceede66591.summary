@entity0 was absent as @entity1 took part in an open training session in @entity4 on wednesday			1

head boy : @entity22 and @entity27 were among the @entity1 players taking part in the game @entity27 's the lad : @entity31 and @entity27 are all smiles with the rest of the @entity1 squad appearing to laugh at his expense leading the pack : @entity22 shares a joke with @entity38 as @entity1 stars train on wednesday missing in action : @entity0 was pictured outside the team hotel , but was absent in training ' @entity0 will be fine and i 'm sure he 'll be ready for saturday , ' @entity22 said			1
' we have training on friday and he 'll be ready for saturday i 'm sure			0
' @entity22 and the rest of his @entity1 team - mates appeared relaxed , and in good spirits , as they took part in a game of ' heads , shoulders , knees and toes '			1
the particular session appeared to be led by @entity1 's assistant coach @entity31 , who also seen joining in with the game			2
@entity57 was the other member of the 23 - man squad not to head out , with the midfielder doing an individual programme as he continues his rehabilitation from a medial knee ligament complaint			2
that injury meant the 20 - year - old was never likely to be involved against @entity11 , but the same can not be said for @entity0			2
the forward looked likely to start on the left flank in @entity67 on saturday , with the setback potentially set to force manager @entity69 into a rethink			0
raring to go : the @entity1 coaching team , led by @entity69 , engaged in conversation on wednesday on the ball : @entity74 , who will line up against @entity11 , and reserve keeper @entity75 are tested during training @entity77 : @entity22 appeared in good shape as the @entity6 star juggled with the ball smiles better : @entity22 appeared to be enjoying @entity83 's company , and right , @entity84 on the ball @entity85 looks likely to be the beneficiary of @entity0 's absence , having impressed during the pre-tournament camp despite only getting 39 minutes of action across the three warm - up friendlies			1
having not featured against @entity92 in their @entity94 send - off , his red card against @entity97 after coming off the bench saw him banned against @entity98 - a match @entity69 had planned to start him in			0
@entity85 had another chance to impress the @entity1 boss in training on wednesday , which took place in 83 per cent humidity with the mercury hitting 25 degrees @entity107			2
the players had access to water spray bottles during drink breaks at the session , where assistant @entity113 hobbled around in a cast after having surgery on his left knee			0
meanwhile , former @entity1 under 21 manager @entity117 believes that @entity118 midfielder @entity27 ' will not kick a ball ' during the @entity10			1
@entity117 , who won 78 caps for @entity1 and appeared at the @entity121 , told @entity122 : ' i think there are five players that will not kick a ball at the @entity10			1
@entity75 and @entity128 are the obvious ones and i think @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity27 will be the others			0
' i think he [ @entity27 ] is very , very short of form			0
watching the last game [ against @entity98 ] i did n't see a @entity27 that sprung on the scene many months ago			2
' i just think he is very , very short of confidence and i see @entity138 , @entity139 or @entity140 ahead of him now			0
' i just feel his lack of form really [ will cost him ] and that will be on @entity69 's mind			0
he had a very disappointing last game and he has not shown me the fully fit @entity146 we saw when he came on the scene			0

the @entity6 striker was absent as the @entity1 were put through their paces on wednesday
