tucked up snugly @entity1 , these beautiful triplets look a picture of health			0
but their lives were saved by a risky operation performed while they were still in the womb after they developed a rare condition which threatened to kill them all			1
thanks to the skill of surgeons who performed the delicate operation , all three girls survived the surgery and were born tiny but healthy			0
smallest triplet @entity18 was so tiny that her parents were warned she might have to stay in hospital for several months but – to their delight – she thrived and was allowed home on @entity31			2
mother @entity32 , 26 , said : ‘ we have three healthy daughters and that ’s the best @entity31 present anyone could ask for			0
’ miss @entity32 , a beauty salon manager who lives near @entity38 , @entity39 , and her partner @entity40 were thrilled when they discovered they were expecting triplets , conceived naturally without fertility treatment			2
@entity18 ( right ) was finally discharged on christmas eve , meaning the family were able to spend their first @entity31 together at home , and now weighs 5lbs although she is still smaller than her 7lb sisters but 17 weeks into the pregnancy doctors treating miss @entity32 detected a problem with the blood supply between two of the babies			1
although all three were growing in the womb together , two of the girls @entity16 and @entity18 were identical twins and sharing their blood supply from the placenta			1
they were diagnosed with @entity59 to @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , a rare condition where one twin gets too much of the blood supply , while the other twin is effectively starved of nutrients			1
smaller twin @entity18 was at risk of not developing properly while her bigger sister @entity16 was receiving too great a share of the blood supply , putting a strain on her developing heart			1
their parents were told the triplets ’ only hope was an operation to divide the twins ’ blood supply , although the operation meant all three girls were at risk			1
although the independent triplet , @entity17 , was not affected by the shared blood supply , her life could have been in danger if the condition led to an infection in the womb or premature labour , or if the surgery went wrong			1
although all three were in womb together , @entity16 and @entity18 were identical twins and shared their blood supply @entity32 and partner @entity40 were thrilled when they discovered they were expecting triplets , conceived naturally without fertility treatment - they were devastated to discover the girls were at risk mr @entity40 , 29 , a sales manager , said : ‘ it was devastating when we knew all their lives were at risk and that they were literally killing each other			1
‘ we were worried about the operation as we knew that in itself could be fatal for the babies , but we knew we had no option if we wanted to try to save their lives			0
’ the specialist surgery was carried out by dr @entity108 at @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , using a laser to separate the twins ’ blood supply			1
the girls ’ parents then faced an anxious two - week wait to learn if the new blood supply was functioning properly			1
mr @entity40 said : ‘ it was very nerve - racking but the doctors and hospital staff were wonderful and reassuring			0
‘ we knew the operation was risky but there were also risks afterwards			0
six hours later the triplets ’ hearts were all still beating which was such a relief			2
‘ we were so thrilled when we heard that the operation had worked and we had n’t lost any of the girls			0
’ the girls were initially due to be born in january but doctors scanned miss @entity32 every week after the operation and delivered the triplets at @entity133 in october			2
their premature birth meant they were all kept in hospital for weeks and they were transferred to @entity136 to be closer to their parents ’ home			2
the premature babies were kept in hospital for weeks and they were transferred to @entity136 the tricky operation was a success and the triplets are now safe and well at home with their parents @entity16 and @entity17 were allowed home in early december but smallest triplet @entity18 had to stay on oxygen in hospital			1
she was finally discharged on christmas eve , meaning the family were able to spend their first @entity31 together at home , and now weighs 5lbs although she is still smaller than her 7lb sisters			0
mr @entity40 said : ‘ they were so tiny when they were born , but they were all little fighters			0
‘ they ’d had a battle for survival which began in the womb and they have fought all the way through			0
we are so proud of them			0
‘ life is a bit manic now they ’re all at home			0
@entity17 sleeps a lot but the twins seem to set each other off every time one of them starts to cry , but we are so happy			2
it ’s the best possible @entity31 present			0
’ consultant obstetrician dr @entity108 , who performed the operation to separate the babies ’ blood supply , said he was delighted all three triplets were born safely			1
he said he had only carried out a handful of such operations , saying : ‘ it is a rare operation in twins and even rarer in triplets as each normally have their own placenta			1
‘ it is a tricky operation with triplets as the extra baby and its placenta can make reaching the other two babies difficult			2
i ’m delighted that the triplets have been born healthy and safe			0
