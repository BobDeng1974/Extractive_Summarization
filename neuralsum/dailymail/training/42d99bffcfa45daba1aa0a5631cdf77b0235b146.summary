@entity0 is set to strike a blow for ‘ @entity2 ’ by putting the @entity3 on all new photocard driving licences from next year			1
but the move has sparked fury among @entity9 independence campaigners after ministers ruled against allowing licences north of the border to carry the @entity13 instead			1
that is despite the fact there are no plans to put the @entity3 on driving licences in @entity19 because of what officials referred to as the ‘ particular sensitivities surrounding symbols ’ in the @entity24			2
the current driving licence has the @entity27 's 12 gold stars with the word ' @entity29 ' inside , but @entity0 will put the @entity3 there instead , infuriating @entity9 independence campaigners mr @entity0 announced two years ago that he wanted to see the @entity29 flag on @entity29 photocard licences			1
they currently show the @entity27 ’s 12 gold stars with the word ‘ @entity29 ’ inside			0
a final go - ahead was postponed until after the referendum on @entity9 independence			0
government sources said last night that licences would carry the flags of both the @entity27 and the @entity29 from next @entity40			0
but they will not allow @entity9 licences to use the flag of @entity9 , or @entity44 licences to carry the @entity46 flag ‘ on cost grounds ’			2
@entity48 , the @entity49 ’s leader at @entity50 , said : ‘ if the @entity29 government is able to make different arrangements for other parts of the @entity29 , i do n’t see why that should n’t also be the case for @entity9			0
’ the @entity3 will be placed in the top left corner of the driving licence , but the @entity13 will not be permitted			1

the @entity3 will appear on all photocard driving licences from next year
@entity29 flag will appear in top left corner instead of the @entity27 stars
