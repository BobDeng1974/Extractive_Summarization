@entity1 chairman @entity0 insists it would have been an ' insane risk ' for the club to keep a core of disgruntled players and remains steadfast in his determination to retain @entity7 and @entity8			1
in just a matter of a few months , @entity9 have gone from the envy of @entity13 football to the butt of jokes			1
soon after manager @entity18 and his staff left for @entity20 , the sales at @entity17 's began as @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 departed for pastures new			1
however , club chairman @entity0 believes the exits will actually benefit @entity9 and highlighted their importance in allowing manager @entity41 the chance to succeed			1
' contracts should be respected , first of all , ' @entity0 said			1
' you sign contracts and both sides need to respect contracts			2
i am a person who still believes a handshake should be enough			2
' there was a situation when there was so much change with the manager leaving and you theoretically ended up with a dressing room with half of your starters not really committed to being there			1
' that is an insane risk for any club and especially a club which was already quite thin last year			2
@entity22 thing : left back @entity22 ( left ) made a big - money move to @entity66 earlier this summer moving on : defender @entity24 left @entity1 last week for @entity67 @entity9 could have won @entity68 - @entity27 ' of actual centrepieces of the club , a few have gone			1
not all five were centrepieces or irreplaceable , but you know there were a couple			2
' for me , if in the end a few players are disgruntled or maybe not sure about it , you can swallow that up			2
you can handle that , but you ca n't have half the team			0
you ca n't have a brand new manager ( dealing with that )			2
' whether that happened out of the past or whether it happened because of the success of the @entity9 last year or whether it happened because players were suddenly in the national team , i do n't know and it does n't really matter			1
' but something happened and i do n't need to do research on it			0
the fact was it was there and we needed to deal with it professionally , be in control of every deal			0
' in the end , that 's something we could n't do to @entity41 , to have a dressing room like that			0
' centre stage : ex-saints captain @entity23 left for @entity107 just before playing for @entity108 at the @entity109 @entity0 now wants to focus on those coming in , with @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 set to be followed into the club on wednesday by @entity116 's @entity115			1
speculation , though , continues over whether @entity7 and @entity8 could be next to leave as they continue to attract strong interest from , amongst others , @entity20			0
last week @entity0 insisted in a series of interviews that the pair were not for sale and continued that stance on tuesday , despite @entity7 's remarkable tweet in which he declared his @entity1 career had been " destroyed "			1
' we 're not the kind of club that right off the bat is going to overreact , ' he said			0
hitting out : @entity7 reacted angrily when @entity1 decided not to sell to @entity20 ' the fact of the matter is there is a strategy in place and that we clearly have @entity7 and @entity8 in the centre , as a core players of building this squad going forwards			1
that is our strategy and we 're going to stick with it			0
we are now on a building and not in a reducing phase			0
' very clearly we do n't communicate with our players in the public , so he was clearly informed of the fact we were not going to sell him			2
immediately after that i communicated with the media about that and that is how we did it			0
then he reacted ( on @entity158 )			0
' i think whoever reacts in certain ways , there is passion involved here and circumstances			0
' asked if @entity7 had been reprimanded for his @entity158 post , @entity0 said : ' no , he was n't			1
i think that there 's situations that evolve where people can be emotional			0
' you should n't , as a club , take everything personally and we did n't take that personally			0

@entity1 finished *eighth* in the @entity176 last season
but manager @entity18 and five *key* players have left since
chairman @entity0 insists @entity9 will be stronger despite *exodus*
