by @entity0 the policy is set to be announced by energy secretary @entity2 this week and will be included in the @entity4 's general election manifesto homeowners could get £ 100 off their council tax bill if they make their property more energy efficient , under plans from the @entity4			1
people will be rewarded for home improvements such as insulating their loft or installing double - glazing or a more efficient boiler			0
the commitment is set to be in the party ’s manifesto for next year ’s election and will be announced this week by energy secretary @entity2			1
to qualify for the £ 100 rebate , a homeowner would have to increase the home ’s energy efficiency rating by two bands			2
all homes come with an @entity25 which rates them on a scale from a to @entity28 – with band a the most efficient			0
most homes in @entity31 are assessed in bands @entity33 or @entity34 mr @entity2 said the plan would offer both lower energy bills and council tax bills			1
he said the council tax rebate will ‘ make action to end your home ’s energy waste a no - brainer ’			0
the policy would cost taxpayers £ 300million a year , but mr @entity2 said it would help meet @entity31 ’s legally - binding targets to slash carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050			1
energy bills will be a key battleground in the election , with @entity52 ’s @entity51 offering a 20 - month freeze in energy bills if he wins , and the @entity55 hoping to cut back the green taxes added to household power bills			0
measures which would move a property up by two efficiency levels cost thousands of pounds , but the @entity4 say they offer a good rate of return on energy bills			1
replacing an inefficient boiler and insulating cavity walls costs about £ 4,000 , with an average energy bill saving of £ 200 to £ 300 a year			2
solid wall insulation costs between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000 , but can save households up to £ 400 a year on heating bills			2
insulating a loft and installing solar panels costs £ 6,000 and saves about £ 200 a year			2
under the @entity4 plans , the £ 100 will still be able to be claimed even if householders get some of the work done through government loan schemes such as the @entity75			1
mr @entity2 has been in charge of this flagship scheme , which was intended to insulate 14million homes in @entity31			1
but the scheme , which offers loans to carry out the work , has been criticised for low take - up and offering poor value for money because of high interest rates			0
while 300,000 people signed up for an initial assessment for efficiency measures by the end of july , only 1,815 installations had been completed			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the cheapest way to make rapid progress in cutting our emissions is by saving the energy we now waste			2
‘ @entity4 have already helped many people to save energy and keep their bills down , and we are on track to meet our target of improving the energy efficiency of one million homes , but this major new tax incentive would mean we could go much further in the next parliament			1
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 added : ‘ @entity31 ’s housing stock is very poorly insulated			1
a lot of @entity110 terraced houses , for example , look great and people love the original features , but the insulation is poor and they are left with high energy bills			0
‘ we are not offering short - term gimmicks			0
the only way to reduce your energy bill – permanently – is to install insulation			0
so we hope this deal would encourage people to dig out their @entity25 and see if they can reduce the rating			0

commitment set to be in @entity4 's party manifesto next year
plans will be announced this week by energy secretary @entity2
policy would cost taxpayers £ 300m a year but would help @entity31 meet carbon emission targets
