she 's one of the world 's biggest supermodels , known for her striking looks and her love of pulling silly faces			0
but if @entity6 is n't careful she might have some competition on her hands , in the shape of her 14 - year - old doppelganger @entity10			1
the teen from @entity12 has accumulated a 7,500 - strong following on @entity14 thanks to the fact that she looks uncannily like miss @entity6			1
and , in a picture in which her face has been photoshopped with @entity6 's , their similarities are even more obvious			0
the fan captioned the split of their faces : ' i wish cara could follow me or like my pic. if you think that i look a little like her pls tag her its really important for me because she is my idol			0
' @entity10 's followers can see the resemblance too and they regularly post comments on her pictures remarking on her likeness to @entity6			1
one user said : ' @entity53 , gorgeous tho , ' while another posted , ' ca n't believe how much you look like cara , wow ! so beautiful x ' @entity10 even has bushy eyebrows - a look @entity6 has made particularly popular over the last couple of years			1
in many of her pictures @entity10 pulls funny faces just like @entity6 , here the two look remarkably similar ( @entity6 is on the left , @entity10 on the right ) @entity10 also has bushy eyebrows a look that @entity6 has made her trademark the supermodel is yet to comment on her ' twin ' but @entity10 , who seems to be a big fan of the model , regularly posts saying that she hopes she will notice her			1
along with her strong brows , pale blue eyes and similar nose and face shape , @entity10 has an uncanny ability to copy @entity6 's signature silly photo faces			2
@entity6 loves to make her eyes pop , stick her tongue out or mug for the camera on social media			0
now her @entity86 lookalike has mastered the exact expression and has filled her @entity14 feed with a mixture of @entity6 pics and her own impression of the model 's face			1
just like @entity10 has strong cheek bones and striking blue eyes but @entity6 is not the only one with a looky - likey fan			2
@entity97 posted a picture of a fan named @entity100 to her @entity101 earlier this week commenting on how she looked just like her			1
@entity97 captioned the picture : ' lol i thought that was me			0
' @entity100 is a model and graphic designer from @entity107 , @entity108 , who regularly gets mistaken for the singer			2
@entity97 ( right ) brought untold joy to her newly discovered doppelganger when she re-blogged this snap of her to her own @entity101 page ( left ) something which she sometimes capitalises on , as she has been previously spotted pretending to be her outside her concerts			0
in fact , she once commanded a two - hour long queue of fans all of whom thought she was the shake it off singer			0
@entity100 said of @entity97 finding her picture : ' when i saw [ @entity97 ] had re-blogged [ shared ] it i screamed and threw my phone and for the next six hours after that i was an ugly mess			2
' @entity97 is everything and the fact that she saw my face and thought it looked like hers - i died ! '			0

@entity10 from @entity12 looks *startlingly* like @entity6
