giant glaciers of ice may be lurking all over @entity2 , hidden from view by dust on the surface			1
that ’s the surprising conclusion of a study that found that large amounts of ice were not just at the @entity2 poles , but likely towards the equator as well			2
it means that , if all ice were to be spread across the surface of @entity2 , the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3ft ( one metre )			1
this image from @entity18 's @entity17 shows that a thick layer of dust on @entity2 covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust the latest research was carried out by scientists at the @entity31 at the @entity32 and published in the journal @entity34			1
evidence of water on @entity2 dates back to the @entity38 mission , which arrived in 1971			2
it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity47 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity2 by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys			2
@entity2 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			1
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june 2013 , @entity62 found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity2			2
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity62 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			0
images from several @entity2 satellites had revealed the shape of glaciers just below the surface , and confirmed most were made of water - ice			1
and now the researchers have measured how big the glaciers are , and their similarity to glaciers on @entity81			0
in total there is more than 150 billion cubic metres of ice on @entity2 , which could ‘ cover the entire surface of @entity2 with 1.1 metres of ice , ’ explained dr @entity87 at the @entity88 at the @entity31			1
she added that the ice closer to the @entity2 equator was ‘ an important part of @entity2 ’ water reservoir			1
’ there are thought to be thousands of glacier - like formations on the planet in both the northern and southern hemispheres			0
they are located on @entity2 between latitude 30.0 and 50.0 - equivalent to just south of @entity101 ’s location on @entity81			1
@entity2 has belts of glaciers at its central latitudes - between the blue lines , in both the southern and northern hemispheres			1
a thick layer of dust covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust using radar measurements ( shown ) from @entity18 's @entity17 , researchers have been able to identify thousands of glacier - like formations on @entity2			1
they can see how thick the ice is on the radar images as the ice has not evaporated into space , the dust must be protecting it			0
if the ice were unprotected , it would evaporate and become water vapour , owing to the low atmospheric pressure on @entity2			1
‘ we have looked at radar measurements spanning ten years back in time to see how thick the ice is and how it behaves , ’ dr @entity87 explained			0
‘ a glacier is after all a big chunk of ice and it flows and gets a form that tells us something about how soft it is			0
‘ we then compared this with how glaciers on @entity81 behave and from that we have been able to make models for the ice flow			0
’ the latest research was carried out by scientists at the @entity31 at the @entity32 and published in the journal @entity34			0
they looked at how big the glaciers were , and also how similar they were to glaciers on @entity81 ( one in @entity150 shown ) @entity18 ’s @entity17 , artist 's illustration shown , launched on 12 august 2005			0
it entered @entity2 orbit on 10 march 2006 , and continues to remain operational today			0
it is tasked with imaging the surface , and also monitors weather and surface conditions on @entity2			2

@entity101 scientists studied ice hidden under the surface of @entity2
dust is thought to be covering huge glaciers on the surface
and the researchers say there is more water - ice than *anticipated*
if spread out it would cover the surface in 3.6ft ( 1.1 metres ) of ice
