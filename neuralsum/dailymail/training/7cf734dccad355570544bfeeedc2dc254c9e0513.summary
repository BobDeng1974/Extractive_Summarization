questions remain : it is thought that mr @entity10 was killed in one of the mountain - top hotel 's £ 600 - a - night villas , but details of his demise are sketchy suspicious : the reception area of the @entity154 in @entity21 , @entity5 , where @entity4 businessman @entity10 was found dead mr @entity125 has ordered an investigation into what went wrong , telling @entity157 that the @entity136 raised the alarm in late january only after warnings from expat businessmen in @entity5			1
the delay meant that @entity136 minister @entity162 met mr @entity26 and posed with a panda on november 15 – the day after mr @entity10 was found dead – unaware of links between the two men			0
