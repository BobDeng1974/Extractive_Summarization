the men fled after mr @entity15 chased them and ms @entity3 found @entity6 left unscathed in her bed upstairs			1
but the 33 - year - old mother of four is now terrified to let her son out of her sight in fear he could be taken from her			1

' i just keep thinking about these strangers putting their hands on my son and i feel sick			0
they could have done anything to him			0
