by @entity0 the accident is still so vivid in my memory			1
it was a hot august bank holiday afternoon in 1994 and i was driving home from my niece 's christening in @entity9			1
i was tired – i 'd just started a new job as head chef at @entity12 in @entity13 and i 'd been working long hours , keen to impress			2
my brother and his girlfriend had hitched a ride and were asleep on the back seat			1
the last thing i remember is cruising along the outside lane of the @entity20 in @entity21			2
then i nodded off and the car drifted to the inside lane , hit the barrier and careered back across the motorway , colliding with the central reservation			1
@entity27 lost his arm after falling asleep at the wheel back in 1994 the driver 's side took the full impact before the car screeched along the central reservation , flipped onto its roof and span round several times			1
i 'll never forget the sound of screeching metal			2
i woke on impact and began screaming , which woke up my brother and his girlfriend , who amazingly escaped with only superficial injuries			2
i was n't so lucky			2
as i hung upside down , held in place by my seatbelt , i noticed a hand on the floor			2
then i checked my right arm and realised there was nothing from the elbow down			1
i must have gripped the steering wheel so tightly that my arm was ripped off when the car was thrown into the air			1
i was losing a lot of blood but i just wanted to let go and die			0
how could i continue cooking ? i could n't accept what had happened , so i wriggled out of the driver 's side and began running – only to be met by other motorists who 'd stopped to help urging me to lie down			0
@entity63 says that losing his arm taught him to live life to the very fullest luckily , one of them was a former military doctor , who stemmed the bleeding and urged me to stay awake to avoid slipping into a fatal coma			1
i wish i knew his name because he saved my life			1
then a lady called @entity72 covered me with a blanket and urged me to think positive thoughts			0
she made me realise there was more to life than work – such as family and friends			1
and at that point i decided that , at 25 , i was too young to die			0
two weeks later i was back at work			0
returning to the kitchen was tough , but i learned to delegate			0
if i could n't chop a carrot , i 'd ask someone else to do it			0
@entity86 , my then boss , was also hugely supportive , helping me source a state - of - the - art prosthetic arm in @entity89			1
slowly i gained the confidence and skill to become the chef i wanted to be			0
nearly dying in that accident taught me to live life to the full			1
so i set myself goals – first to retain the hotel 's existing @entity97 star , then to secure another , which i did in 1999			0
now i 'm aiming for a third			0
since then there have been many milestones , such as gaining an mbe in 2006 and @entity12 being voted no 1 in the @entity105 last year			0
the accident made me a better man			1
i know what it 's like to be reliant on those around you , and i believe in giving others the opportunities i was given			0
but i 've never wanted pity : there 's no room for that in my industry because to be the best you have to be good			0
you ca n't expect people to pay less because you only have one arm			2
