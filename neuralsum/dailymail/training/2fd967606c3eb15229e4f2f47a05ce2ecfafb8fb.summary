by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 13:23 est , 28 november 2012 a dog walker made a rare discovery when he found a six stone fish the size of a child washed up on the beach near his home			1
@entity9 , 44 , was walking his @entity10 along the @entity12 beach near @entity13 , @entity14 when he nearly tripped over the blob - like creature			2
the find was even more unusual than he thought as it turned out to be a a @entity20 mola , or @entity21 , which normally lives thousands of miles away in the middle of the @entity24			1
rare guest : the mola mola sunfish is normally found in the middle of the @entity24 mr @entity9 brought the giant sunfish home and contacted marine experts who told him the significance of his find			1
the @entity20 mola has previously been spotted washed up on @entity35 beaches but never before has one been discovered on the @entity37 east coast			1
although it weighed six stone , this is considered very little for an @entity21 which can grow to be 14ft ( 4.2m ) long and 10ft ( 3.1m ) wide and weigh a whopping 5,000lbs , or 357 stone			2
mr @entity9 said : ‘ whilst taking @entity10 for a walk on the beach , he was tugging at something on the shoreline			2
when i went up to see what he had found , i could n’t believe my eyes			2
‘ at first i thought it was a dead seal and nearly tripped over it , but as soon i realised it was a fish i knew it was something i have never seen before			1
large haul : the sunfish found by mr @entity9 in @entity57 - on - sea weighs six stone fetched fish : mr @entity9 found the sunfish when he was walking his black @entity10 , right , on the @entity12 beach near @entity57 - on - sea big baby : although this specimen tipped the scales at six stone it is considered a tiny one for the mola molas who can weigh up to 357 stone when fully grown ‘ to me , the fish looked somewhat prehistoric , but after doing some research i discovered it was a @entity21 sunfish			1
' although they do n’t have tails , the ocean - dwellers can still jump clear of the water			2
in january this year another @entity20 mola was found on the beach in seaside resort @entity77 in @entity78			1
this was followed by a 35ft sperm whale which was discovered 14 miles from @entity12 at @entity81 in april			0
in 2011 a 55ft fin whale washed up on the beach in @entity84 , @entity85 , which normally lives far away in the @entity24			1
in 2008 an extremely rare 12ft @entity88 's beaked whale and a baby @entity86 were found within days of each other on the western shores of @entity92 on the @entity93			0
they have been known to be spotted along the west coast of @entity96 but it is extremely rare to find one on the east			0
@entity99 , director of the @entity100 , said : ' it is rare and unusual to get sunfish in the @entity103			0
‘ they are mainly found in the middle of the @entity24 and the furthest i ’m ever seen them go is the @entity35 coast			1
‘ so for it to navigate around @entity110 like that is quite remarkable			0
for it to be washed up like that is even rarer as the prevailing winds would usually propel it away from land			0
‘ i have heard of sightings in @entity119 and @entity120 waters but on an @entity37 beach on the east coast is rare			0
’ @entity21 develop their truncated , bullet - like shape because the back fin which they are born with never grows			0
instead , it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures , creating a rounded rudder called a clavus			0
@entity20 in @entity132 means ‘ millstone ’ and describes the ocean sunfish ’s somewhat circular shape			0
@entity24 athlete : it does n't look it but the @entity21 sunfish can jump clear out of the wate			1

the mola mola fish normally lives in the middle of the @entity24
