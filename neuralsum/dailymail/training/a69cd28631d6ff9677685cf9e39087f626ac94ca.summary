@entity0 has hired a controversial @entity2 election guru on a six - figure salary to help him campaign on the cost of living and his vow to freeze energy prices			1
@entity8 – who helped to mastermind @entity10 ’s two presidential election wins – is notorious in the @entity2 for a highly - criticised campaign to raise electricity bills			1
it is an embarrassing link for the @entity15 leader who has made a 20 - month freeze on fuel prices a key promise ahead of next year ’s election			0
mr @entity0 said in his last party conference speech : ‘ gas and electric companies that put prices up and up and up			2
it ’s not good for an economy			0
’ @entity0 's new spin chief @entity8 ( left ) pictured beside @entity10 ( centre ) as he ran for president in september 2008 mr @entity8 ’s firm was accused of trying to deceive voters in the @entity2 by producing adverts claiming that without a hefty price hike , the lights would go off			1
ostensibly , these adverts were produced by a group of local citizens and businesses in @entity38 called consumers organized for @entity40			0
in fact , the whole campaign was a front for the state ’s largest power supplier , @entity46 , which paid mr @entity8 ’s lobbying company , @entity47 , £ 8million to build support for the price rise in 2006			1
when his firm ’s involvement was revealed it caused a political storm , with @entity38 ’s @entity56 governor @entity55 saying : ‘ it ’s corporate money trying to hoodwink the public ’			0
yesterday @entity15 hailed the hiring of mr @entity8 as a major coup following a narrowing of their lead in the polls and claims that their cost of living message will lose momentum as the economy recovers			2
labour leader @entity0 ( pictured ) hired @entity8 who came up with @entity10 's campaign slogan ' yes we can ' @entity71 , the shadow foreign secretary who is in charge of the election campaign , said that energy would be a key part of the message			1
mr @entity8 ’s appointment follows a trend for bringing expensive strategists from abroad			0
the @entity80 have hired @entity82 spin doctor @entity81 to help them win the election in a reported £ 500,000 deal , and @entity85 hired @entity87 @entity86 as a £ 110,000 adviser			0
but not everyone welcomed the decision			0
@entity15 ’s @entity91 , a former party treasurer , told the @entity92 she was ‘ not that enthusiastic ’			0
she said : ‘ i ca n’t really see how a decision has been made to spend that six - figure sum on one person when what we really need is lots and lots of organisation going on around and about in the country to turn out the vote			1
‘ if we do n’t get people coming out of their houses and voting on polling day then we are not going to win			0
’ mr @entity8 has apparently not met mr @entity0 in person , but believes he can win			1
he claimed in an interview : ‘ @entity0 understands the struggle that people are going through in @entity110 to make a living wage , to support their families , to retire with some dignity			0
he understands that a growing economy demands that you have broad prosperity and not just prosperity that ’s hoarded by a few			0
’ it was mr @entity8 who persuaded a reluctant mr @entity10 to accept the ‘ @entity122 ’ slogan in the 2008 presidential election			1
that campaign swept mr @entity10 to the @entity124 on a wave of heady optimism and rhetoric			2
six years on , that bold pledge seems a very hollow boast to most @entity2 and has become a millstone round mr @entity10 ’s neck			1
but mr @entity8 , the product of a left - wing family in @entity133 , will have no regrets			2
his task was simply to get his man into office			0
in the @entity124 , mr @entity10 made mr @entity8 a senior adviser but , it later emerged , he and other aides soon clashed with @entity140 , who was trying to interfere in policymaking			1
although he was credited with once again heading mr @entity10 ’s campaign strategy in the 2012 election , a well - sourced book last year revealed that he had been pushed out during the campaign following a civil war with other senior officials			2
they had been particularly upset , it was claimed , when mr @entity8 hired a lawyer to negotiate a sweetheart deal that made him rich by taking a small percentage of the cost of every tv advert run by the @entity10 campaign in 2012 .			1
