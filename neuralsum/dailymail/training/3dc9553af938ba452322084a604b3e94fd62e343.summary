by @entity1 reporter published : 18:24 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 21 september 2013 @entity3 looks set to equal @entity5 's record by winning a third term in @entity8 elections tomorrow although her coalition stands almost neck - and - neck with opposition parties			1
a survey for broadcaster @entity13 last night showed the @entity8 chancellorâ € ™ s @entity16 and its sister @entity18 party the @entity19 14 points ahead of the centre - left @entity21			1
this means she will almost surely return for another four - year term			0
@entity3 is on track to win a third term in @entity8 elections tomorrow although her coalition stands almost neck - and - neck with opposition parties			1
as campaigning entered its final stage before the election tomorrow , @entity3 faced a battle to preserve her centre - right majority and avert a potentially divisive ' grand coalition ' with her rivals on the left			2
but her combined centre - right bloc was in a dead heat with @entity39 - leaning opposition parties yesterday , with both camps on 45 per cent , putting her coalition in jeopardy			0
mrs @entity3 could win a narrow majority with the @entity44 , her preferred partner , be forced into difficult negotiations with the @entity46 which could last up to two months and result in big changes to her cabinet , including the departure of finance minister @entity50 , a key player in the crisis			0
the election is being watched across @entity53 , with many countries hoping it will bring about a softening of the austerity - first approach mrs @entity3 has promoted since the eurozone debt crisis broke out nearly four years ago			0
the wild card is a new anti-euro party , the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , which is given a decent chance of vaulting above the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats in parliament on election night			2
earlier this week polling results indicated @entity68 ( @entity61 ) party could have entered the @entity8 parliament the @entity70 for the first time , after a survey conducted by @entity73 on behalf of the respected @entity75 newspaper showed support for the party was growing such an outcome would most likely force mrs @entity3 to form a left - right ' grand coalition ' with the @entity46 , who increased their share of the vote by one per cent to 28 per cent in the latest poll			1
although the @entity46 has publicly stated it does not want a grand coalition , experts believe it would probably enter into one if push came to shove			0
that would doom mrs @entity91 € ™ s hopes of continuing her current coalition and stir concerns about rising @entity8 euroscepticism , though its impact on government policy would likely be limited .			2

survey showed @entity8 chancellor 's @entity16 and its sister @entity18 party is ahead
