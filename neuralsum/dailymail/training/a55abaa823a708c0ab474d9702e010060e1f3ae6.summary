@entity1 ’s @entity0 gives his assessment of @entity4 ’s performance at the @entity5 as @entity6 were humbled by @entity7			0
sunday 's @entity9 encounter took a huge turn after @entity11 was penalised for an apparent foul on @entity13 when @entity6 were 3 - 1 up			1
the decision proved costly as @entity7 went on to claim all three points by scoring five goals past @entity17			0
@entity11 was penalised by @entity4 for a late challenge on @entity13 when he had in fact been fouled by the @entity7 forward @entity11 and @entity21 protested against @entity4 's decision to send off @entity23 @entity23 deserved to see red after deliberately fouling @entity7 forward @entity13 @entity25 scored from the penalty spot to round off the scoring for @entity7 it ’s hard to criticise a referee , but the elite group are told by management that they can not defend the indefensible			1
with @entity6 cruising and destined for three points , @entity4 somehow missed what appeared to be a clear foul on @entity11 by @entity13 – and to compound the error then gave the softest of penalties when the @entity39 recovered and brushed the striker off the ball			2
if that was an error then the second penalty certainly was n’t , as was the easy decision of sending off @entity23 for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity .			0

@entity9 official @entity4 *awarded* @entity7 a penalty in the second half for an apparent foul by @entity11 on @entity13
however @entity11 was fouled in the build up to the *incident*
@entity7 scored the *resulting* penalty on their way to a 5 - 3 *victory*
@entity23 was *rightfully* dismissed for a foul on @entity13
