she 's just days away from giving birth but , as ever , the @entity2 refused to let her style icon status slip during her second pregnancy			2
rather than swaddling her growing bump under baggy dresses , the 33 - year - old dressed to impress every time she stepped out			2
but while @entity11 coats and @entity13 gowns did creep in , much of @entity2 's pregnancy wardrobe came from the @entity14			2
leading the @entity14 charge to the @entity2 's wardrobe is @entity17 , a mid-range label that has taken her through everything from glamorous evening events to international tours			1
so enamoured is @entity2 of the brand , even @entity30 , of which she was once a die - hard fan , has had to make way for it , although another budget favourite , @entity35 , also remains a favourite			2
' @entity37 of @entity38 likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe , pre and post-baby , and @entity17 is the perfect brand for her , ' explains fashion pundit @entity45			1
@entity17 : a £ 160 shirt dress ( left ) in january and , right , in a peplum top at a @entity49 event in november ' not only is it uber @entity52 , with everything designed in - house in @entity55 , it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol : not too revealing , neutral colours , and affordable			1
' @entity37 wore a brown shirt dress from @entity17 to visit foster carers in @entity55 in january and a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a @entity49 reception at @entity64 in november			1
on that occasion , she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by @entity70 for maximum effect			2
but while she championed @entity17 on several occasions during her second pregnancy , it is by no means the only high street staple in @entity2 's wardrobe			1
spot the @entity2 ! @entity2 in a £ 169 @entity78 coat in march that was first seen in 2013 , right the brunette royal is also a huge fan of a small @entity81 label called @entity18 , which has grown from a small shop in 2002 to the a-list favourite it is today			1
@entity37 is the brand 's most famous fan , having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies			0
along with a £ 195 coat worn in january and a £ 95 blue and green floral dress sported to visit the @entity89 in february , she also opted for the brand when making her début in @entity92			1
on that occasion , it was the glamorous £ 225 plum boucle @entity95 coat that was chosen - and true to form , the design has since sold out repeatedly			1
@entity18 is the brainchild of @entity99 expat @entity98 , who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on @entity101 , and is no doubt thrilled with the royal endorsement			1
in march , on a visit to @entity106 drama @entity104 , @entity2 wore a chic cream coat from high street maternity label , @entity109			2
she has also sported a shirt dress from @entity111 and £ 99 print dress by @entity113 during her pregnancy			1
cosy : @entity2 in a £ 275 @entity95 coat with prince @entity117 in @entity92 in december last year @entity18 : @entity2 in a £ 195 coat in january and , right , wearing a £ 59 @entity120 dress in december thanks to the much - marked @entity2 effect , everything she has worn has swiftly sold out			1
' one of the reasons for her enduring sartorial popularity is the accessibility of her wardrobe , ' explains @entity45			0
' it 's very real			0
people can relate to her through her wardrobe , which is a clever move from her and her people			0
' nothing is out of reach , and she does wear a lot from the @entity52 @entity14 , which is great to see			0
it allows people to copy her head - to - toe			0
people want her hair , her make - up and now her wardrobe			0
' people want someone to look up to when it comes to the royals			0
she is the new generation			0
' she , more than any other royal , has made fashion achievable for the public			0
@entity149 had an amazing wardrobe but she wore a lot of made - to - measure pieces			0
' she 's quite safe with her wardrobe , which makes it even more accessible			0
' good look : @entity2 wore a £ 250 blue @entity155 tile - print shirt dress in a video message supporting mental health chic : @entity2 in a £ 69 @entity160 maternity coat and , right , in a £ 35 @entity19 polka - dot dress in march			1
