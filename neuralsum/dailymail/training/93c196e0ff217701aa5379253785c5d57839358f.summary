by @entity0 @entity1 was hit with a £ 70 fine after stopping her car outside a school for just seven seconds a grandmother of six was hit with a £ 70 fine by her local council after stopping her car outside a school for just seven seconds			1
charity worker @entity1 , 71 , from @entity8 , @entity9 pulled up on zig - zag lines outside a school in the city as she searched for a parking space			1
she has been left furious after her seven - second stop led to her being filmed by a nearby @entity16 van and sent a parking fine			1
mrs @entity1 , who does charity work for the @entity19 , had been trying to drop leaflets off at @entity21 to promote a musical event			1
she did n't even turn her engine off or get out of the car as she peered past the school gates through her driver - side window			1
she said : ' i had barely stopped the car			0
it was pouring with rain and i was just looking to see if there was somewhere to park on the school grounds			0
' i am responsible driver , and because it was pouring down with rain i just wanted to have a look and see if there was anywhere i could park			0
' a passerby kindly tapped on my window to notify me that a council van was filming me , so i waved and then moved on			2
' it was all over in a few seconds - and now i 've been left with a huge bill			0
' when i found out i had been fined i was appalled - it 's just another way of churning money			0
' mrs @entity1 wrote to @entity44 asking for them to waive the fine , but the widow lost her appeal at an independent hearing			2
she said : ' it is ridiculous - because i stopped for such a tiny amount of time , i would have hoped the council would have the decency to waive the fine			2
a video of the incident taken by the @entity16 van shows mrs @entity1 's car outside the school at 12:02 and 21 seconds after looking inside the school gates for a place to park , she then pulls away just seven seconds later ' anyone can see it is ridiculous and i argued my case because of the principle			1
' i will admit that i stopped outside the school , but if you look at the incident as a whole , it is truly unnecessary and ridiculous			0
' if people do n’t challenge these fines on the principle , what else will the council try and get away with ? ” a @entity44 spokesman said : ' drivers have the right to appeal against any notice they feel is issued unfairly			2
in this case , that process has been followed and the notice has been upheld			0
' we would also point out that the safety and wellbeing of those travelling to and from schools is paramount and that parking restrictions , including zig - zag lines , are important safety measures			0
' mrs @entity1 was trying to park outside @entity21 in south east @entity8 when she was filmed a @entity44 car like this one took the footage which led to mrs @entity1 's £ 70 fine			1
