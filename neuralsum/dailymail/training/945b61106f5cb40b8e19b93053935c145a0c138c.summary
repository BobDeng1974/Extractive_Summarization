by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 denial : @entity5 will board a plane to @entity7 tonight after three and a half years fighting to avoid it honeymoon murder suspect @entity5 will board a plane for @entity7 tomorrow night after a three - and - a - half year battle – and the world will finally learn whether the mental illness which delayed his extradition is real or faked			1
the millionaire care home owner , 33 , has denied any involvement in the killing of his @entity3 wife @entity17 , 28 , in a crime - ridden suburb of @entity1 in 2011			1
since then his lawyers have fought his extradition to @entity7 , where he faces charges of murder and conspiracy			1
they have claimed he is ‘ too ill to be extradited ’ and would be a high suicide risk as he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression			1
but @entity17 ’s father @entity26 told @entity27 yesterday : ‘ i have always queried in my mind just how mentally ill he was			1
just how long can post-traumatic stress last is a question that has been in and out of my mind continually			0
‘ @entity5 was perfectly well during the time he travelled back from @entity1 with @entity17 ’s body and he was arrested soon after			0
’ while the arguments raged at repeated appeal hearings , @entity5 has spent the past 18 months living in a camper van in the grounds of @entity38 mental health hospital near @entity39 and has been allowed to visit his family home nearby during the day			1
the @entity27 has learned that @entity5 is set to enjoy special privileges from the moment he arrives at @entity44 , a @entity7 psychiatric hospital			1
his lawyers have argued that these privileges are necessary to uphold his human rights after the protracted legal battle over his extradition			1
a private room has been prepared for him and he will even be allowed to pay for his own chef to bring him meals every day			0
like other patients on the general ward , he will also be able to take part in group therapy , cooking , belly dancing , and sewing classes and will be allowed a free visit to a beauty salon and barber once a week			0
but , despite the apparently relaxed conditions , security has been tightened and @entity5 ’s every move will be watched by investigators determined to prove he is fit enough to stand trial for murder			1
@entity17 ’s father @entity26 said : ‘ she was my daughter , certainly , but since she was shot she has become the daughter of the world			1
‘ i have been asked if i have any objection and my answer is that i do not			0
i feel the world wants to know what happened to @entity17			0
‘ judging by the thousands of letters from across the world we have received from people we have never met , there is a great amount of interest			0
’ showing tuesday ’s hearing when @entity5 appears to be formally charged – and any resulting hearings – on tv is a decision for the judge			0
the case could rival the media sensation of the ongoing murder trial of @entity104 for shooting his model girlfriend @entity105			2
mr @entity26 said he had discussed cameras being in court with @entity7 prosecutors and broadcasters and had given his backing			1
several tv and radio networks have sent applications to the @entity114 president , arguing there is a valid public interest in live coverage			0
the announcement came as mr @entity26 and his wife called for a change in the extradition process between @entity122 and @entity7 as @entity5 ’s trial draws near – more than three years after the killing			1
‘ it has been nothing short of torture for us			0
an extradition order should not take so long , ’ mr @entity26 told @entity27 from his home in @entity3			2
@entity5 ’s flight will be met by officers from the elite @entity133 police unit and he will be escorted to @entity1 ’s @entity134 to be formally charged with murder			2
from there , whether he is granted bail or not , he will go to @entity75 , which houses some of @entity7 ’s most notorious killers and rapists			1
hospital insiders say a private room has been refurbished for him in @entity143 and he will be under 24 - hour observation by a team reporting back regularly to the court			0
they must decide whether @entity5 is capable of going for trial and whether he is aware of the serious nature of the indictment for murder			2
a report based on their findings will be submitted to the court within 30 days and his hospitalisation period could be extended or a court date set			0
experts told @entity27 : ‘ any notion that he has been faking illness for the past few years will be minutely examined			2
' @entity159 will be at a minimum so as not to mask his true condition			0
@entity5 will be seen regularly by consultants but it is when he is back in the ward that he will let his guard down and that is often where we get our most useful insights			0
‘ his attitude to other patients and the staff , even domestic workers , will be crucial to our observation methods			0
' a medical source at the hospital told @entity27 : ‘ frankly it is impossible for him to be genuinely ill for that period , we have never experienced that			2
’ @entity5 denies any involvement in the killing of 28 - year - old @entity3 national @entity17 , who was shot as the couple ’s taxi was apparently car - jacked in the @entity185 township in november 2010			2
the @entity7 government has made clear it is keen to have @entity5 declared fit to stand trial for arranging the killing , after three men already jailed for the murder claimed they were offered £ 1,400 to carry out the crime			1

@entity202 's lawyers said he was too high a suicide risk to be extradited
care home owner , 33 , has always denied involvement in his wife 's murder
tomorrow he will board a plane for @entity7 after three and a half years
her father said : ' i have always queries just how mentally ill he was '
