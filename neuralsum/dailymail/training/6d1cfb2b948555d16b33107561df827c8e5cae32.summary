@entity0 has told @entity2 fans not to expect a rush of new signings early this summer			1
the manager , who saw his side sit at the top of the @entity8 for more than 100 days this season , insists that getting bodies through the door in a @entity12 year is a difficult process			1
it has been a campaign of missed opportunities for the @entity16 , although they can end their trophy drought with an @entity20 win against @entity21 later this month			1
' in my experience , in a @entity12 year , the transfer business does not get done early , ' he said			1
' everybody is focused on the @entity12			1
at the moment you can do nothing because the season is not over			1
' do you realise it is one month from the start of the @entity12 ? it is unbelievable			2
the @entity47 final is on the 24th may and basically two weeks later it is the start of the @entity12			2
' there is no time between the end of the season and the start of the @entity12			2
nobody will do anything before the @entity12 starts			2
' there appears to have been a slight change in policy at the @entity56 over the last year			2
@entity57 was signed for a club record £ 42.5million from @entity59 in september , while there was an ongoing saga with @entity62 and @entity63 which threatened to completely engulf the summer transfer window			1
@entity0 confirmed @entity65 is close to agreeing a new contract , but he needs a number of new faces in if they are to challenge for in @entity70 and the league			1
he has been criticised for a perceived stubbornness in the past , but the @entity73 is in no mood to be dictated to by others as the search for added quality goes on			2
splash the cash ! @entity0 spent £ 42.5m on playmaker @entity57 from @entity59 in september even after failing to win a trophy for nine years , the boss does n't begrudge @entity81 their impending title			1
' it looks like they ’ll win it , ' he said			2
' it will need a miracle for them not to win			0
it was tight at the top and at the bottom			0
' it was a season where @entity21 just won it , getting over the line			0
they won the marathon and they turned up in the last 100 yards			0
they turned up when it mattered			0
the turning point was the @entity104 game they won			0
' it was not easy for them			0
@entity62 had an outstanding second part of the season			0
they are maybe the most unlucky team of the season			0
' we have been 128 days top of the league			0
so we have won the stamina league			0
but we faded in big games away from home			0
' @entity21 scored 100 goals			0
we scored 66 at the moment			0
that ’s where we have room for improvement			0
' sign on the dotted line ! defender @entity125 is close to agreeing a new contract at @entity2 on his way : @entity128 is set to play for @entity2 away at @entity129 on sunday afternoon @entity128 is putting himself in a strong position to be considered an @entity132 starter at the @entity12 as he returns from injury this weekend			1
the midfielder is likely to be involved at some point during their game away at @entity129			1
he has n't played since @entity139 's side narrowly beat @entity140 at @entity141 in march after hobbling out with a foot injury just before the hour - mark and has n't played for his club since			1
although the 22 - year - old wo n't be anywhere near match fit , it is encouraging news for @entity132 fans ahead of the finals in @entity152			1
while it 's positive for @entity128 , forward @entity153 is again missing for the @entity16 as they travel to @entity155 .			1

@entity0 does n't think @entity2 will sign players *quickly* this summer
boss insist @entity81 are *worthy* title winners
@entity128 is ready to make his comeback against @entity129
@entity65 close to agreeing new contract
