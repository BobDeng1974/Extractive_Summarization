by @entity1 reporter an invasion of @entity4 super ants is believed to have spread across southern @entity5 after a massive nest was found in @entity7			1
the @entity9 ’s first colony of the insects , which are attracted to electricity and munch through cables sparking fires and blackouts , was reported in 2009 at @entity15 , @entity16			2
experts were called in to get rid of them but it is believed many ants escaped and have since colonised a huge swathe of southern @entity5			2
@entity4 super ants , which swarm together rather than crawling in lines like garden ants , form large colonies with interconnected nests spreading over many miles			2
they are dependant on the sugary liquid called honeydew left by aphids , form ‘ super colonies ’ , with many queens and interconnected nests spreading out over many miles			0
the ants , called @entity50 , were first found 20 years ago in @entity51 after a colony was found in @entity53 , @entity54 , and have now colonised areas of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
if the ants from @entity16 have made it all the way to @entity7 - almost exactly 100 miles from where they were first found in 2009 - it could mean they have marched through @entity16 , @entity67 and @entity68 before reaching the capital			1
bosses at @entity71 say they were called out to home in @entity30 last week after the owners noticed that the ants were ‘ behaving oddly ’ and that there were ‘ tens of thousands of them ’			1
pest control experts uncovered a large nest of the creatures in @entity30 , north @entity7 last week			1
file photo the species are drawn to electricity , a compulsion that is stronger in the ants that the drive to eat or drink , and the can cause blackouts and fires by eating through electrical cables			0
in the house in @entity30 , pest controllers found thousands of the ants inside the couple ’s microwave and other electrical equipment as well as in the garden and a bedroom			1
@entity98 , one of the managers with @entity71 , said yesterday that the find in @entity7 was a ‘ wake up call ’ that the ants are spreading across the @entity9			1
he said : ' initially our technician thought they were garden ants but then we noticed they were behaving in an unusual way and they were n’t following trails			0
' they were being seen absolutely everywhere in the house including the microwave and on a bed			0
' we sent a sample of insects to experts who identified them as @entity4 super ants , and with treatment advice from ( fellow pest control experts ) at @entity121 and @entity122 we were able to modify our inspection and treatment procedures accordingly			1
' a colony of the ants was first reported in @entity15 , @entity16 in 2009 , but are feared to have spread a spokesman for the firm said the ant infestation in @entity30 was ‘ serious ’ and that it was harder to control and kill the super ants than normal black garden ants			2
he said ' : ' @entity4 super ants form super colonies , sometimes consisting of tens of thousands of ants in interconnected nests			2
' new satellite colonies are formed by ‘ budding ’ - ants leaving the ‘ home nest ’ and forming new colonies			0
' these satellites may be very small , for instance in a potted plant , and it is thought that in this way the super-colonies can gradually develop			0
' this budding behaviour means that the ants can be easily transported by commerce and seed a new colony			0
' these nests do not compete with each other although they do compete strongly with other ant species in the area			0
nests are found in leaf litter , under paving , and other stones , and around the base of trees			0

@entity4 ants first found in manor in @entity16 five years ago
nests in north @entity7 this week spark fears they are spreading
*homeowners* report swarms of ' tens of thousands ' in @entity30
pest control experts say finds are a ' wake up call ' to @entity9
