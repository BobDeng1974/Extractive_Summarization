@entity0 narrowly missed out on reaching the quarter - finals of the @entity2 as they fell to a seven - wicket loss against @entity4			1
@entity5 had earlier struck his maiden @entity2 century and @entity0 were indebted to their captain as his 107 helped them post a modest 237 all out			2
however , the 30 - year - old was outshone by @entity9 , whose unbeaten 101 led @entity4 through to the next stage of competition on net run - rate			1

@entity4 however , were on the end of heavy defeats against bitter rivals @entity31 and the @entity34 and were facing increasing scrutiny over whether they were going to be able to seriously contend at this @entity2			2
but with the competition geared towards ensuring the ‘ top - eight ’ teams make it through to the knockout stages of the competition , all the sides knew even as little three wins could see a team advance			0
in hindsight the turning point in the tournament for @entity0 came against @entity26 , against whom they suffered a mammoth 201 - run loss			1
the match obliterated their net run - rate			2
@entity0 's @entity65 takes a catch to dismiss @entity4 's @entity23 for 63 runs @entity21 of @entity0 stands in the outfield as they attempted to beat @entity4 in @entity69 meanwhile , @entity70 , @entity4 ’s effervescent and immovable captain was slowly ensuring he continued to carry his side back to some respectability			2
a shock 29 - run ( @entity75 / l ) victory over @entity26 ensured the match against @entity0 would be a straight knockout , after the @entity34 guaranteed their safe passage to the quarter - finals with an easy victory against the @entity42 earlier in the day			1
@entity5 decided having runs on the board would be his side ’s best chance of victory against the 1992 @entity2 champions , having won the toss			0
admittedly the @entity90 pitch did look every bit the ‘ batting paradise ’ @entity97 called it and despite missing their leader with the ball @entity95 , @entity4 had @entity0 in all sorts of trouble early on			2
@entity100 went for three to @entity2 debutant @entity101 as he tried to play across the line and was trapped lbw			0
despite surviving an early scare after being dropped by @entity23 on five , @entity65 failed to make the most of his reprieve as he top - edged a @entity107 delivery to @entity108 at short square cover on 11			0
spectators enjoy the atmosphere during the 2015 @entity2 match at the @entity90 @entity113 of @entity0 survives a run - out attempted during @entity0 's batting innings @entity17 players celebrate getting the wicket of @entity5 of @entity0 @entity108 , relieved of his keeping duties in the previous match against @entity26 , seemed rejuvenated and went on to become the joint - record holder with four catches as a fielder			1
but @entity0 ’s innings centered around their captain who , in what may well be @entity0 ’s final @entity2 match , played some of his best cricket of the tournament as he made his hundred			0
as many batsmen do , @entity131 rode his luck – including being dropped on 99 by keeper @entity9 and he scurried through for his century			0
it took an impressive catch from @entity137 to finally dismiss the @entity139 captain for 107 off the economical @entity140			0
the equation for @entity4 was simple , win or tie against @entity0 and they would be through and @entity9 and @entity23 ’s 120 - run first wicket partnership took them a large way towards their target			1
though @entity23 ( 63 ) and @entity145 ( 3 ) fell in quick succession , @entity70 steadied the ship and while the @entity4 captain ended up being dismissed in the most peculiar way - as he stood so far back to an @entity151 delivery that he tread on his stumps , @entity4 never looked in trouble			0
@entity5 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity0 team - mate @entity113 after reaching 100 runs @entity101 ( centre ) celebrates after successfully appealing for @entity156 to dismiss @entity0 's @entity100 although it was a comfortable victory , the end was slightly marred by @entity9 ’s insistence in obtaining his own personal milestone and rather than opting to take singles with @entity108 , he waited for the opportunity to clear the field			1
had @entity0 amassed a few more runs that dangerous strategy could have led a more serious issue for @entity4			0
@entity0 may be returning home earlier then they has hoped at the beginning of the day but they will at least be able to do so in the knowledge that they defeated more test playing nations than @entity171			0
it ’s unlikely to be of much comfort to the associate side with their future in the competition unknown but @entity0 along with the other associate sides – @entity178 , @entity179 and the @entity42 – showed in the past four weeks that the @entity2 will truly miss them if the @entity2 has its way			1
@entity4 's wicketkeeper @entity9 ( left ) watches as team - mate @entity137 ( r ) dives to stop a ball @entity4 's @entity137 catches out @entity0 's @entity183 for just 18 runs during @entity0 's batting innings			1

@entity188 cruise to seven - wicket win over @entity0 in @entity33
@entity0 *condemned* to exit after @entity9 's unbeaten 101
they go out after @entity34 secure better run rate following @entity42 win
