by @entity0 last updated at 9:34 am on 26th september 2011 the red squirrel faces extinction in the next two decades as its population has dropped by half in the past 50 years , warn researchers			1
efforts through wildlife biodiversity action plans to save @entity9 mammals have failed to halt the decline in numbers of red squirrels , as well as hedgehogs , @entity15 wildcats and dormice			1
red squirrel populations have been hit by invasive grey squirrels , which compete with reds for food and carry a disease which is fatal to their native cousins			2
and wildlife experts think the animals will soon be confined to remote areas of @entity9 such as the @entity27			2
under threat : the population of red squirrels has fallen by half in the past 50 years , according to experts according to a @entity37 report , numbers of @entity35 hedgehogs have dwindled to about 1.5million , compared with 30million in the 1950s			1
a report by the university 's wildlife conservation unit for the @entity41 states that the common dormouse and mountain hare are also under threat , despite the efforts of nationwide biodiversity action plans			1
@entity47 of @entity9 's mammals study claims that seven mammal species whose conservation was given priority status were still declining last year			2
the report states : ' although many of @entity9 's mammals apparently declined significantly in the past 25 years , some appear to have stabilised or even increased in the last decade , ' the report states			0
1 red - necked phalarope ( pictured ) 2 @entity60 - tailed godwit 3 @entity15 wildcat @entity62 5 cuckoo 6 red squirrel 7 turtle dove 8 @entity67 toad 9 @entity69 hare @entity70 ' of the 25 monitored mammal species native to @entity9 , half are stable ( not necessarily in a good state ) or increasing			1
' despite the largely negative news from the report , there was some encouragement from the fact that the populations of bats , otters and water voles has increased			0
otters in particular have benefited from cleaner rivers in @entity9 , following a ban on chemicals used in sheep dip in the late 1990s			0
but a combination of pesticides killing their prey , hedgerow low and other factors has seen the @entity35 's hedgehog numbers plummet			1
the omens for the red squirrel have also not been helped by the discovery in @entity15 in 2005 of the squirrel pox virus , carried by grey squirrels			1
the disease had previously been confined to @entity99 , where it has been one of the causes of the huge reduction in the number of red squirrels			0
@entity105 , one of the report 's authors , warned : ' we expect the future of red squirrels to be confined to a few islands , such as @entity111 and the @entity112 , or in the @entity27 of @entity15			1
' he and co-author @entity114 added : ' the last 15 years have seen some successes , particularly recovery of some rare species			0
' however , with the ongoing decline of once common species , like hedgehogs , it is widely accepted that targets for the @entity123 , for 2010 , were missed			0
' in general , progress has been better for species restricted in range that could benefit from targeted , site - based , conservation efforts			0
' there 's been less progress on targets for habitats and many widespread species			0
' dying out : the hedgehog is now on the list of the 10 most endangered species in @entity9 as well as ' holding the line ' by taking steps to protect threatened mammals , the authors suggest radical conservation efforts including bringing back once - native species , such as beavers and even the @entity143 , to the @entity35			2
' we should be thinking about beaver reintroductions in @entity146 and @entity99 in the course of the immediate future , ' professor @entity105 said			0
he has also floated the idea of more radical interventions to help @entity9 's wildlife , including taking large areas out of agriculture for 're - wilding ' and fenced and unfenced nature reserves			0
an environmental survey last month named red squirrels , hedgehogs , the brown hare and the @entity15 wildcat in @entity9 's top 10 endangered species			1
the red - necked phalathrope was said to be @entity9 's most endangered species , while the red squirrel was sixth , and the hedgehog tenth .			2

hedgehog population drops to 1.5m from 30m in 1950s
@entity15 wildcats and dormice also under threat
