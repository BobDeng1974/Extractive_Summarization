judging by the car park at the @entity2 students here are not going to struggle with making ends meet			0
a @entity5 , a @entity6 and a black @entity7 , which would n't look out of place in a @entity10 film , line the student car park row after row			1
the gallery of supercars was taken by student @entity15 who wanted to show the world the array of models on show at the university			1
a @entity21 which cost more than £ 100,000 is parked at the @entity2 no expense spared : why not rock up to class in this gold coloured @entity5 a red @entity6 fit for a superstar - or a student at the @entity2 he said : ' i attend the @entity2 and the cars that students drive here are just ludicrous			1
' if i was back home in @entity35 my car would be considered nice , but here nobody looks twice at it			0
' these pictures were taken in the span of a couple days and only in one of the parking lots of the school , so this is n't even close to all of the nice cars at the school			2
' because @entity47 and @entity48 are a dime a dozen here , i only included a few of them in the album			0
not your average ride home : a @entity55 which retails at about £ 49,000 which was left in the student car - park high - life : a 2013 @entity58 similar to this would set you back more than £ 100,000 a @entity59 570 - 4 @entity60 worth more than £ 160,000 belongs to one of the rich students at the @entity2 sporty : a red @entity64 which belongs to a student at the @entity2 ' keep in mind , almost all of the students are between 18 and 24 years old , as the graduate programe is pretty tiny here			2
' the students that drive the insanely expensive cars ( @entity73 and @entity74 etc. ) are usually local ( @entity75 ) for those wondering			2
' the @entity2 in @entity77 is a private university which was founded in 1995			0
it offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees and a @entity80 in @entity81			0
many of us dream of owning a @entity64 like this but we 'll have to wait to win the @entity85 competition : this @entity5 is parked next to @entity87 both of which would set you back more than £ 100,000 luxury : a white @entity87 worth more about £ 120,000 is owned by a student at the the @entity2 another world : a gold @entity95 which have a starting retail price of about £ 92,710 @entity97 : @entity98 worth about £ 70,000 and a @entity6 parked next to each other at the @entity2 of @entity100 a white @entity95 which retails now from about £ 90,000 left in the car park at the @entity2 nice wheels : an @entity103 and a @entity64 parked side - by - side at the @entity2 souped - up : while most dream of one day owning a car like this , a student drove this black @entity95 to university @entity110 heads : a @entity111 which could have set the owner back more than £ 150,000 a @entity113 which costs about £ 16 , 121 is one of the less expensive models on the site but still looks the part one lucky student at the @entity2 gets to drive this silver @entity21 to class everyday life of luxury : a @entity122 which costs more than £ 80,000 to buy at the @entity2 slick : a red @entity123 which comes with a price tag of more than £ 30,000 pocket money : a red @entity126 would set you back more than £ 60,000 - affordable for this student unique : the bonnet of this super car parked at the university features the flag of @entity75 excessive : a @entity135 pick - up truck which cost up to £ 40,000 on the road parked at the university expensive taste : a white @entity139 parked at the @entity2 not your bog standard ride to school : a red @entity6 at the @entity2 a blue @entity95 which start from £ 92,710 is owned by a student at the @entity2 student living ? a @entity145 which has a starting price of around £ 82,945 while most students ca n't afford a tin of baked beans this student drove to university in a @entity5 @entity48 : this could be a snap of a @entity155 oligarch convention but it is at the @entity2			1
