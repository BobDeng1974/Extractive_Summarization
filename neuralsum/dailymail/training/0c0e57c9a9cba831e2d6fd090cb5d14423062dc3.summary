the @entity1 plans to scale back her public duties and give prince @entity3 a bigger role as ‘ co-head ’ of the royal family , well - placed sources have revealed			1
@entity8 and senior figures in @entity10 began discussing how to deal with the monarch ’s advancing years several months ago , the @entity7 understands			1
they concluded that her 64 - year - old son – the longest - serving heir apparent in @entity16 history – should take a more prominent position representing the sovereign at key events , particularly those abroad			0
the @entity36 will also join them			0
it follows the surprise announcement by @entity8 yesterday that , in a 40 - year first , the @entity1 will not attend the @entity40			1
instead , @entity3 will take her place at the two - day event in @entity43 in november			1
aides reluctantly admitted what has been suspected for some time : that the monarch , who reached the age of 87 last month , was not up to making frequent long - haul trips			1
but @entity3 ’ presence at @entity51 today suggests it is also part of the carefully - choreographed plan to share the burden of responsibility			1
one senior royal source told the @entity7 the decision for the @entity1 not to go to @entity43 was part of a ‘ wide - scale review ’ of her travel plans , although they insisted that it was largely ‘ business as usual ’			1
aides were also swift to deny that her majesty ’s recent ill - health – she was hospitalised in march for the first time in ten years after being hit by gastroenteritis – had anything to do with the development			0
but the fact is that the elderly monarch , who still conducts more than 300 engagements each year , has been gradually scaling back her diary at home too and her illness was a clear sign that her legendary stamina can no longer be taken for granted			0
the @entity1 now spends only about three days a week in @entity77 or away on official visits , and prefers to read her official papers over a long weekend at @entity80			1
in addition , she is understood to be concerned not to put too much strain on her husband , prince @entity83 , who will be 92 next month and still accompanies her on most trips			0
it is not long since he received hospital treatment for a heart condition and a recurring bladder infection			0
the @entity7 has also learnt that there has even been tentative discussion of a change in the law which would be required to allow prince @entity3 to become regent			2
historically , regents have only been created when the monarch is seriously incapacitated – for instance , when @entity98 was mentally unwell			0
prince @entity3 , seen here with comedian @entity100 at a reception for @entity16 @entity103 communities at @entity104 yesterday , will attend the state opening of parliament the @entity1 receives flowers from nine - year - old @entity107 , nine , as she arrives for the rededication of the newly refurbished @entity109 at @entity110 the queen , accompanied by @entity83 , arrives for the rededication of the newly refurbished @entity109 @entity8 sources have said the @entity1 is to allow prince @entity3 to take over the long - haul trips because of her age constitutional experts regard the idea of making @entity3 regent – an effective co-monarch – as a controversial and indeed unprecedented step while the @entity1 remains healthy			1
should it ever be contemplated , it would almost certainly require an amendment to the @entity122			0
one well - placed source said the @entity1 would ‘ never , ever abdicate ’ given the unhappy family history which saw @entity125 ‘ abandon ’ the throne in favour of the @entity1 ’s father , @entity128			1
on the eve of her 21st birthday she memorably vowed to serve her country for the rest of her life , ‘ whether it be long or short ’			0
‘ but there is an increasing sense that she can not go on as she has been , ’ the source said			0
‘ she is approaching her 90s			0
she has extraordinary stamina for a woman of her age			0
significant : the @entity3 will represent the queen , who is head of the @entity40 , at the meeting in @entity43 in november			2
he is pictured recently with @entity144 , @entity36 important : the queen is pictured in @entity146 , @entity147 at the 2011 @entity148 but some of the more challenging foreign trips are increasingly not possible for her and more particularly prince @entity83			2
prince @entity3 and @entity144 are to attend the @entity34 today for the first time			1
the royal couple will watch as the @entity1 sets out the government 's plans for new laws for the year			2
it is the first time the @entity3 has attended since 1996 and will fuel speculation that he is taking a more active interest in the role of monarch			1
@entity3 and @entity144 will travel in their own procession ahead of the @entity1 , @entity161 said			1
a @entity161 spokeswoman said : ' the @entity3 often supports the @entity1 on state occasions , and his and the @entity167 's diaries were clear on this occasion			1
' ‘ her appointments across the board are going to be reviewed and prince @entity3 , who is already doing more , will become more prominent			2
‘ what is being discussed is whether that happens informally , as it has been for some time , or whether something more formal is pursued			0
’ yesterday ’s short statement by @entity8 that ‘ @entity1 will be represented at this year ’s @entity148 by the @entity3 ’ belied the extent of thought that had gone into it			1
@entity1 , who has attended every meeting since 1973 , views her stewardship of the @entity40 as one of the most important legacies of her reign and would not have taken the decision lightly			2
the next meeting is due to be held in 2015 , when she will be 89			0
unless it is held in @entity77 , her visit to the @entity146 meeting in 2011 may turn out to have been her last			0
the decision to send @entity3 may also have been motivated by the fact that in recent years some @entity40 countries have questioned whether the @entity3 should automatically become head of the @entity40 when he becomes king			2
despite suggestions that the role move to an elected individual , the @entity3 feels strongly that it should be his , and his presence as the @entity198 can only strengthen his case			2
@entity40 secretary - general @entity200 welcomed the decision , saying : ‘ this decision reflects the wish of her majesty at this time in her reign to limit her long distance travel			2
’ significantly , a decision about the future of @entity3 ’s own son , prince @entity210 , is due to be announced in two weeks			0
joint visit : in 2007 , both the @entity3 and the @entity1 attended the @entity148 in @entity212			1
the queen is pictured at the time duty : the @entity212 trip was the first time @entity3 had been to an overseas @entity148 and was seen as an important event for the heir to the throne busy : the decision to send the prince to @entity43 instead of the @entity1 also signifies a son 's commitment to easing the burden on his parents in their advancing years it is believed that the second in line to the throne will quit his role as an @entity232 pilot for an army ‘ desk job ’ which will allow him to take on more royal duties			1
this will continue the move to get younger members of the royal family to take on more official business , which started in earnest last year when the @entity1 delegated all her foreign @entity243 travel to them			2
that is not to say that she or prince @entity83 , who recently returned from @entity245 , wo n’t make any visits abroad at all			0
but they will , almost certainly , be extremely few and far between			0
a palace source said : ‘ from now on any long - haul trips will be looked at on a case by case basis			1
there is no suggestion that the @entity1 ’s diary will become less busy but it is part of an ongoing process looking at the @entity1 ’s long - haul travel arrangements			1
’ according to the @entity1 ’s official list of engagements , she has seven visits planned for the rest of this month , both with the @entity83			0
last night the couple attended the rededication of the refurbished @entity109 in the @entity263 .			0
