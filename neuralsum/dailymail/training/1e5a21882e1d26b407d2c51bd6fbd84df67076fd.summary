a pregnant mum says she was ordered to surrender two jars of @entity2 at @entity3 because staff claimed the chocolate spread posed a terror risk			1
@entity7 became upset when staff at a security checkpoint ordered her to hand over the jars which she was carrying in her hand luggage at the airport in east @entity3			1
the 35 - year - old says a worker told her the chocolate spread breached liquid restrictions and could not be carried onto the plane			1
these can include : @entity7 , a home economics teacher , said : ‘ they told me the chocolate was dangerous and had to be confiscated			1
’ she and her husband , @entity32 , were flying home to @entity34 after a short break in @entity3 , where they spent the weekend sightseeing , shopping and attending a concert			0
among the highlights was a visit to @entity23 department store in @entity43 , where shoppers can buy special jars of @entity2 with their names on the label			2
they 're so popular queues often bring the shop to a standstill			0
@entity7 , from @entity52 near @entity53 , bought one jar for her three - year - old son , @entity56 , and another for work colleague @entity57			1
she was so pleased with her festive purchases she even posed for a picture in front of the @entity2 display in the store			0
but festive spirit was sadly lacking when the couple got to @entity3 for their flight home			0
@entity7 said : ‘ we 'd packed everything into our hand luggage so that we would be quick getting on the flight , but as we watched the bags go through the scanner , we realised something was wrong			1
’ @entity74 called @entity7 to one side and asked her to open her bag			2
pointing to the two jars , they asked what they were			2
a spokesman for @entity3 said it adheres to rules set out by the @entity84 ‘ i explained that they were @entity2 spread and that they were @entity87 presents			0
but they said that as they were a liquid they 'd have to be confiscated			0
‘ it seemed completely daft			1
it was obvious what they were and that they did n't pose a security threat			0
’ as they waited in the departure lounge , @entity7 's anger turned to tears , and she had to be consoled by @entity32			2
she said : ‘ i know it seems daft , but i 'm feeling a wee bit sensitive at the moment because i 'm pregnant , and it is nearly @entity87			0
’ current rules require all liquids , pastes or gels to be stored in containers no larger than 100ml a spokesman for @entity3 said it adheres to rules set out by the @entity84			1
current rules require all liquids in containers over 100ml in size , including large bottles of water , lotions and perfume , to be stored in luggage in an aircraft ’s hold			2
if large containers are found in a traveller ’s hand luggage they will likely be thrown in the bin			0
the rule was implemented in 2006 after authorities foiled a terror plot to use liquid explosives to blow up several aircraft travelling from @entity133 to the @entity134 and @entity135			0
but it is the @entity137 ’s goal to lift the ban and screen all liquids , lotions , powders , pastes and gels by january 2016 using laser scanning technology .			1

@entity7 said staff told her the spread breached liquid restrictions
the 35 - year - old says the *situation* ' seemed completely daft '
she purchased the customised jars for her son and a co-worker
edible spreads included in current restrictions on liquids , gels , pastes
