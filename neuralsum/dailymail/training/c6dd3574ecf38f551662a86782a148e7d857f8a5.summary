the officers also leveled allegations at the aug. 26 meeting against cpl. @entity54 , who had been picked to fill in for @entity47			1
the officers complained that @entity54 had , among other things , mishandled evidence			2

a driver is pictured entering the town of @entity3 , @entity4 , where motorists can encounter up to six different speed limits in a roughly two - mile drive @entity3 has long had a reputation as a speed trap , but the allegations made by the police officers were particularly stunning since ticket quotas are illegal under @entity4 law			1
in 2013 , @entity3 's seven police officers filed 11,603 traffic citations , according to records obtained by the @entity85 newspaper			1
that compares with 25,461 citations in 2013 for much larger @entity26 , which has 300 officers and 128,000 residents , including thousands of college students			2
the fines paid by motorists are a big money - maker			0

after council appearance , the officers filed a complaint with the @entity4 inspector @entity104 seeking protection under the @entity107			1

but enforcing speed limits is @entity3 's responsibility , said @entity161 , a traffic operations engineer at @entity144			1
@entity3 residents said many people do drive through town too quickly , but hope the multiple speed limit changes could be reduced to make it easier to comply with the law			0
