a decorated @entity1 officer who devoted his retirement to helping troops serving on the frontline shot himself after allegedly feeling ‘ harassed ’ by a former aide to @entity7 , @entity5 can reveal			1
brigadier @entity8 , 57 , ended his life after receiving phone calls and a ‘ harassing voicemail ’ over a £ 300,000 dispute involving his military charity			1
@entity14 was a director and trustee of @entity16 , a charity founded in 2005 which works with the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) to deliver @entity20 food parcels to troops in war zones			1
@entity23 - pictured with son @entity24 , and her late husband @entity25 - says the @entity8 felt he would be ‘ the sacrificial lamb ’ in a row between @entity28 and a businessman who @entity31 man @entity30 was representing in a letter to friends and family breaking the news , his widow said the brigadier was left agitated after speaking to pr man @entity30 earlier this month , saying he felt he would be ‘ the sacrificial lamb ’ in a row between @entity28 and a businessman who mr @entity30 was representing			1
in the letter , which was distributed on social media , devastated @entity23 , 55 , said : ‘ @entity25 received an email on sunday evening [ march 1 ] which made him very agitated , and in his letter to me he said that the final straw was a harassing voicemail during the day from the same man			2
‘ it all concerned the @entity20 box charity for which he was the chairman of trustees			2
the founding businessman felt that he had never been properly recompensed for his initial ( very substantial ) outlay – despite formal arbitration and subsequent revisiting of the arbitration by legal teams			1
‘ a high - powered pr man started to harass @entity25 for some sort of out - of - court settlement			0
neither the charity nor the @entity18 could legally ‘ pay off ’ a claim that was unsubstantiated , so he concluded ( again in his letter ) that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would have to be found ‘ guilty ’ in order that the claims could be settled			1
‘ everyone knew that he would have done nothing wrong but he felt powerless to challenge the allegations and did n’t have the resilience or energy to go through such a potentially traumatic period			2
’ just hours after speaking to mr @entity30 , a former director of communications for the @entity73 , @entity14 wrote a suicide note and killed himself in the grounds of his @entity77 family home near @entity79 in @entity80			1
' brought in to mediate ' : @entity30 said he was ' deeply saddened ' by @entity14 's death when questioned by @entity5 , mr @entity30 confirmed he had attempted to persuade @entity14 to negotiate with businessman @entity82 , who in 2005 provided @entity83 with hundreds of thousands of pounds of start - up cash			1
when the charity ’s trustees refused to pay back mr @entity82 from @entity28 funds , he started legal action			0
according to the charity ’s 2008 annual report , an arbitrator found the businessman was owed funds			2
the report adds that @entity28 accepted the award but that mr @entity97 ’s company ‘ claimed further amounts ’			0
mr @entity30 , from @entity98 , @entity99 , said : ‘ as far as i know brigadier @entity8 and i did not know each other previously but he was aware of who i was and my background			1
i was brought in to mediate			0
‘ our conversations were very reasonable and i got the impression he felt i was genuinely trying to help			0
he even thanked me for my efforts			0
he was surprised that the issues were still around , he thought it was all sorted by the arbitration and i said , well , unfortunately , it remains a dispute			0
the way the conclusion was arrived at is regarded , by some people , as invalid			0
the dispute is over several hundred thousand pounds and is very complicated			0
’ a friend of @entity14 claimed that mr @entity30 adopted an ‘ icy tone ’ in their conversations , but the pr man insisted : ‘ i absolutely refute any suggestion that i was threatening and i was deeply saddened to learn of his death , this is tragic , ghastly			1
’ when approached by @entity5 , mr @entity82 said : ‘ it is a very difficult situation and we are very saddened by the news			0
@entity30 is our mediator and he knows the true side of the story and i would listen very carefully to him			2
’ @entity14 was made a commander of the @entity132 ( @entity133 ) during a glittering military career			1
his funeral was held yesterday			0
