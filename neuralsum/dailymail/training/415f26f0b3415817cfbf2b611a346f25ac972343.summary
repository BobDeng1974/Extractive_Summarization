published : 17:00 est , 2 november 2013 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 2 november 2013 cheerleading ? pah ! it 's a pastime for softies and schoolgirls , a kitsch parade of pom poms , tinsel and @entity9 grins			1
it 's not a real workout			1
at least , that 's what i thought until i was invited to train with @entity15 , the dauntingly named cheerleading squad of the @entity18 american football team			1
within moments of arriving for a training session at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , and being handed my pom poms - ' shake them to fluff them ' - i realise that i am hopelessly out of my depth			1
@entity29 training with the @entity31 cheerleading squad at @entity21 , @entity23 these women are athletes at the very top of their game			1
they have six - packs			1
they can do the splits and smile at the same time			1
they can high - kick for three hours straight without their make - up running			1
and i am just a man who does a bit of jogging in his spare time			1
they obviously sense my weakness , since they suggest we ' begin gently ' with a set of ' simple ' bends and twists			1
but we are soon bouncing in and out of the splits			1
or rather , they are			1
i think i 've spread my legs but , glancing in the mirror , i seem to still be standing upright			1
' you 're doing great , ' says 22 - year - old @entity56 , an effervescent five - year veteran of the team			2
' @entity58 , ' i whinge , unconvinced by her pity			2
the cheerleaders were over here from @entity62 to support the @entity18 , who played an @entity65 match at @entity66 last weekend			1
but the roar 's acrobatic performances are underpinned by constant training - and that definitely does not mean just learning to wave a pom pom and look pretty			1
in fact , it 's a very particular kind of exercise , and i was warned at the outset that cheerleading and running - the latter being my means of keeping fit - do n't really mix. running tends to tighten muscles , while cheerleading demands the opposite : strength with flexibility			1
these women are athletes at the very top of their game			2
they can do the splits and smile at the same time even the warm - up is gruelling , but you need to be supple if you 're going to attempt those signature high - kicking routines			2
indeed , cheerleading is a perilous sport			1
there is even a @entity96 entry on ' dangers of cheerleading ' , which reveals that their moves account for 67 per cent of all athletic injuries among female @entity103 college students			1
' i pulled a muscle in my leg during my audition for the roar , ' says 20 - year - old @entity107			2
' but i just pressed on			2
it hurt so much , but there was no way i was giving up			2
' a sport for softies ? i am rapidly changing my mind			2
with the warm - up over , we move on to a dance : the team 's signature routine is choreographed to @entity118 by @entity119			2
i fluff up my pom poms as the instruction begins			2
' the dance is eight lots of eight counts , ' says @entity56 , ' which is around 60 moves			2
we 'll just teach you half of it , though			2
' sounds easy enough , does n't it ? we form a line , with me in the middle , while @entity56 talks me through the steps - ' shaking , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , then split on eight			2
' shampoo ? ' oh , that 's just what we call any move that goes over our hair , ' @entity56 explains			2
' @entity139 , on we go			0
it 's shampoo , one , spin to the back , up , out , together , look , look , spin , back			0
' i 'm already completely lost , but there 's no reprieve			0
cheerleading requires not just strength but a bafflingly extensive memory for routine			1
the roar may be able to learn three such dances in a single three - hour training session , but it 's not a skill i possess			1
even in slow - motion , i am a staccato shambles with my pom poms			0
i look like a jellyfish dad at a disco			0
by the time they add music and quicken the tempo , i am at least five moves behind on every run - through			0
cheerleading requires not just strength but a bafflingly extensive memory for routine not that it matters - this is one of the few forms of fitness that are actually enjoyable			1
cheerleading is a discipline you must perform with a smile - it 's part of the job description - and it really does @entity179 makes gruelling warm - ups and intense cardio sessions feel like fun			1
it 's worth trying next time you visit the gym			0
' smiling is contagious , ' says @entity107			0
' smile and the crowd will smile with you			0
' perhaps that 's what helps the roar 's girls survive such taxing practice sessions - they each have their own personal workout routines , then train together for three hours , three times a week , and then do extras ; some choose dance or @entity200 ( great for the abs ) , others run up and down the stadium steps			0
it has to be this way			0
an american football match lasts for four hours and they will be cheerleading throughout			1
no wonder they each drink as much as a gallon of water during every match			0
it turns out to be strangely addictive			0
as we stand together in a kick line , hands placed on each other 's shoulders , and begin counting and kicking - with straight legs and pointed toes - i 'm mesmerised by the movements			0
we could be on the stage of the @entity224			0
my kicks are stiff , low and , frankly , pitiful next to those of the professionals , but i feel part of the team - even if i would look rather out of place in their annual calendar			0
cheerleading at this level is almost entirely female			1
you 'd think such a tough sport would attract more men but , ironically , cheerleading began as just another boys ' club , with @entity239 's @entity240 's ' @entity239 ' mentioned in the newspapers as early as 1887			1
they did n't do much more than holler , though , and it took the arrival of the first women in 1907 - and their gradual domination of the activity - for cheerleading to become the gymnastic performance we now know			1
today , cheerleading at this level is almost entirely female			1
but why ? you 'd think such a tough sport would attract more men			0
' it 's the kick line , ' says @entity107			0
' most men simply do n't have the flexibility			0
and they 'd struggle to fit into the uniforms			0
' ouch ! but after this eye - opener , i ca n't argue with that			0
beaming the balance beam of school sports halls is now a huge hit with adults			0
people stand barefoot on a foam beam , then do exercises such as walking , twisting , lunging and squatting			0
working on the beam engages the body 's core and makes the muscles work harder and more consistently			0
great for balance and stability			0
@entity276 the new @entity276 at @entity277 is a multi-functional frame on which people can swing and hang , with suspended rings like those in the @entity282			0
the difficulty comes from supporting the weight of your own body			0
good for stretching , developing joint mobility and building muscle tone			0
