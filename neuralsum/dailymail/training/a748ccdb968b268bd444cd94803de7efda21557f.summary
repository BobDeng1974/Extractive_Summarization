equipped with miniskirts , kitten heels , and assault rifles , these are the goose - stepping girls who led @entity4 's biggest ever show of military might yesterday			1
@entity7 's battalions of babes were taking part in a lavish display intended to strike fear into @entity4 's adversaries and rally the country 's beleaguered populace behind its youthful @entity15			1
solemn faced and tightly regimented , they marched amid columns of tanks , artillery and farm equipment that showed the isolated dictatorship remains on a war footing 60 years after the end of the korean war			0
the assembly of weapons and troops was reminiscent of the marches held by the @entity64 and @entity52 at the height of the @entity66			2
it is one of the few chances the world gets to see @entity4 's military up close			1
although @entity30 frequently uses the occasion to reveal new , though not always operational , hardware , there did n't appear to be any new weapons in today 's parade			0
its arsenal of missiles , however , was front - and - centre			0
the colourful military parade in @entity80 marked the 60th anniversary of the @entity82 saturday 's parade marks a holiday the @entity85 call ' @entity86 in the @entity45 , ' although the @entity87 remains technically at war while the lavish parade was held , about 200 people gathered in @entity91 , some burning pictures of the @entity4 's ruling @entity7 dynasty in protest at their northern enemy thousands of civilians marched alongside festive floats , and veterans sat out in the hot sun for the two - hour spectacle despite it 's impressive parade , analysts do n't think the country has yet mastered the technology needed to build warheads small enough to fit on long - range missiles overlooking a sea of spectators mobilised in @entity112 to cheer and wave flags , the leader @entity7 saluted his troops from a review stand			1
he was flanked by senior military officials , the chests of their olive green and white uniforms heavy with medals			1
as fighter jets screamed overhead , a relaxed looking @entity7 smiled and talked with @entity52 's vice president			2
@entity52 fought with @entity4 during the war and is @entity30 's only major ally and a crucial source of economic aid			2
@entity7 did not make a speech			2
@entity7 's rule , which began in late 2011 after the death of his father , @entity130 , has been marked by high tensions with @entity132 and @entity91			2
he has overseen two long - range rocket launches and a nuclear test that drew widespread condemnation and tightened @entity137 sanctions			0
leader @entity7 saluted his troops from a review stand and was flanked by senior military officials , but did not give a speech @entity85 veterans of the @entity45 stand and salute during a mass military parade on @entity112			1
the @entity4 's parade tradition goes back to the founding of the country in 1948 few countries - including @entity4 's communist models - continue to trot out their military forces in public squares with such pomp and pageantry colourful : @entity85 women cheer during today 's military parade contrast : a sea of colourful flowers is waved by thousands of @entity85 during today 's parade , the biggest display of @entity85 military might in the country 's history ex military : former @entity165 personnel cheer and wave during the parade @entity4 have turned to tentative diplomacy in recent weeks , but march and april saw @entity85 threats of nuclear war against @entity132 and @entity91 in response to annual @entity173 - @entity172 military drills and @entity137 condemnation of @entity30 's february nuclear test , the country 's third			1
long - stalled @entity85 nuclear disarmament talks show no sign of resuming			0
today 's parade marks a holiday the @entity85 call ' @entity86 in the @entity45 , ' although the 1950 - 53 @entity45 that refers to ended in a truce and the @entity87 remains technically at war			0
last year 's parade , held to commemorate the april celebrations of the 100th birthday of the late national founder @entity29 , @entity7 's grandfather , created a buzz among military watchers when the @entity190 rolled out a mysterious long - range missile known abroad as the @entity192			1
most outside observers now believe the missiles were mock - ups , but they were carried on mobile launchers that appeared to have been obtained from @entity52 , possibly against @entity137 arms trade sanctions			0
@entity198 , the army 's top political officer , said @entity4 should be ready to fight to defend the stability the country needs to revive the economy			2
but his speech at @entity112 was mild compared with past fiery rhetoric from @entity30 attacking the @entity172 and @entity173			0
history : the central square in @entity30 is a sea of colour , left , as bronze statues of former @entity85 leaders @entity29 and @entity130 stand tall above the parade , right military might : a @entity213 short - range ballistic missile is carried on the back of a military vehicle as part of the parade leader @entity7 ( left ) meets heads of delegations from various countries , who are visiting @entity4 to attend a ceremony of the 60th anniversary of the truce meanwhile , in @entity173 , president @entity225 vowed not to tolerate provocations from @entity4 - @entity91 says @entity85 attacks in 2010 killed 50 @entity173 - but she also said @entity91 would work on building trust with the @entity4			1
' i urge @entity4 to give up the development of nuclear weapons if the country is to start on a path toward true change and progress , ' @entity225 said in a speech			2
@entity4 is estimated to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs , but many analysts do n't think it has yet mastered the technology needed to build warheads small enough to fit on long - range missiles			0
about 200 people gathered in @entity91 , some burning pictures of the @entity4 's ruling @entity7 dynasty , at a rally meant ' to condemn the nuclear development and threatening strategy of the tyrannical regime of @entity85 leader @entity7 , ' said @entity251 - sung , an @entity253 activist			1
@entity254 , who visited an exhibit on the armistice on saturday at a recently opened history museum , said she wants the rival @entity259 to be unified - but as a democracy , not under @entity4 's autocratic rule			1
' it 's a real tragedy for @entity4 that we are still a divided nation , ' @entity254 said			2
fireworks explode behind the @entity267 this evening			0
this is one of the few chances the world gets to see @entity4 's military up close fireworks explode over the newly constructed @entity45 museum			1
@entity4 is estimated to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs the @entity4 's parade tradition goes back to the founding of the country in 1948			1
few countries - including @entity4 's communist models - continue to trot out their military forces in public squares with such pomp and pageantry			1
but @entity30 has stuck with them because its leaders believe they are a good way to show the world those things about the military they want to reveal , while at the same time sending a potent message domestically of the power of the ruling elite			0
' the beauty of a parade is that weapons systems do n't actually have to work in order to be impressive - a missile launcher looks good even when the missile wo n't launch , ' said @entity301 , an expert on the @entity64 and @entity303 militaries at @entity304			0
that can be risky , however			0
almost as soon as last year 's parade was over , military experts around the world said they thought the stars of the show - the long - range @entity192 missiles - were mock - ups of a design that is still being perfected and probably could n't actually fly , despite @entity4 's claims that it has the capability to strike the @entity172 with nuclear - tipped icbms			1
' they certainly learned that they might lose some reputation by showing imperfect mock - ups , ' said @entity319 , a private - sector aerospace engineer in @entity321 who is regarded as one of the world 's leading authorities on @entity4 's missile capabilities			1
' better to show nothing and let the world know by ` leaked secret information ' how dangerous they are			0
' even so , analysts say the parades send important messages meant to signal strength to @entity4 's people - who are not privy to such outside analysis			1
as it rolled out its arsenal saturday , military helicopters , jets in formation and other warplanes did flyovers			0
later , thousands of civilians marched alongside festive floats , a departure from previous parades			0
a truckload of soldiers wore chest packs with nuclear symbols			0
' after watching this parade , i feel our country could defeat anyone , ' said @entity358 , 84 , a captain in the @entity85 infantry during the war who sat in the hot sun with other veterans at the square for the two - hour spectacle .			0
