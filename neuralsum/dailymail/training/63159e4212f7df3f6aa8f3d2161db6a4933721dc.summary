by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 19:10 est , 1 february 2013 the company behind @entity2 is releasing @entity4 - style building blocks based on the iconic doll			1
@entity2 will allow young girls to build , design and decorate their own , mainly pink , @entity2 world – and even construct her signature convertible car			2
the new line of toys is a result of a collaboration between @entity15 and the makers of @entity2			1
it appears to be a reaction to the decision by @entity4 to launch a hugely successful – but controversial – series of building sets specifically for girls , called @entity22			1
new toys : @entity15 are set to release @entity2 to rival @entity4 's similar pink range there has also been a trend towards more gender neutral toys as manufacturers and retailers react to concern among some parents that boys and girls are being stereotyped from an early age			1
however , the @entity2 construction sets , with their vivid pink colours , are definitely more girly than gritty			0
@entity2 invites girls to build , design and decorate their own @entity2 world with compatible playsets and mini-fashion figures			2
girls will be able to build a luxury mansion , a fashion boutique and even the @entity2 doll ’s signature convertible car one pink brick at a time			0
the sets , which are designed for girls aged four and up launched in the @entity49 ahead of @entity50 and are coming to @entity52 stores in march			0
i 'm a @entity2 girl : the pink hued @entity2 themed toys will see children design a building blocks version of her popular house just for her : @entity2 definitely goes against the gender - neutral trend on the toy marked mini-figures of @entity2 and her friends start at £ 5.99 , while the ‘ @entity66 ’ pink convertible is £ 16.99 , a pool party set is £ 39.99 and the luxury mansion is £ 79.99			1
@entity4 launched its construction sets for girls – @entity22 – a year ago			1
that is also dominated by pink and pastel colours , while the set themes include a beauty parlour , a café , a stage , a convertible car and a splash pool			0
the initiative drew some criticism from parents on web forums with commentators arguing it was wrong to restrict children to specific types of toys and colours			0
some complained that it was a betrayal of what had previously been a ‘ beautifully genderless toy ’			0
same audience : @entity4 's friends range launched to attract girls to buy @entity4 products dr @entity100 , developmental psychologist and @entity2 child play expert , said girls love and benefit from creative construction just as much as boys			1
‘ playing with building toys provides children with an ideal way to engage in discovery - based learning , ’ she said			1
‘ it is through this type of learning that children are able to build their confidence through trial and error and develop a sense of achievement , enabling them to physically link their world to the play world , building their brain power in the process			0
‘ combining block play with open - ended and imaginative play , children experience an extraordinary level of brain building			2
‘ this combination of play patterns encourages exploration and storytelling , building context for children and a better understanding of the world around them			0
’ a senior vice president for @entity15 , @entity133 ( correct ) , explained the decision to launch the sets , saying : ‘ we know what girls want in @entity2 ’s world – to imagine , explore and discover			2
‘ the @entity2 collection invites girls to build @entity2 ’s world in a way that is true to the @entity2 brand – fashionable and aspirational			0
