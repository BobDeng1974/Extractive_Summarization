by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s stint as @entity5 ’s club captain is close to an end with the @entity8 defender destined for a move to @entity10			1
few fans will miss the 28 - year - old as a leader as injury problems coupled with a lack of form have seen him ousted from the starting line - up , let alone from his role as skipper			2
but every @entity21 challenger needs a leader , and in that respect the @entity23 have a sizeable hole to fill			2
here , @entity26 looks as the possible candidates to replace @entity3 this season			2
doubts remain over the 32 - year - old ’s future at the club though , with his contract due to expire at the end of the 2014/15 season			1
supporters may doubt the @entity55 ’s presence on the pitch too			0
@entity36 is a man who keeps his cool in possession , but is hardly a grafter or a natural leader			1
helping hand : last season 's vice-captain @entity36 gives new signing @entity66 advice in training @entity68 expecting great season @entity70 searching for a presence ? well look no further			1
standing at 6 ’ 7 ” the @entity74 @entity73 winner demands respect			2
along with @entity36 would be a sensible choice for @entity43 , having stood in for @entity3 and the @entity55 last season			1
commanding at the back , screaming instructions throughout the game , even idolising @entity81 as a youngster ; mertesacker appears to be the best fit for the role in this squad			0
@entity70 : per @entity70 returns to @entity5 as a @entity73 winner and is not afraid to speak his mind @entity88 after a stellar breakthrough year last season @entity88 will be in @entity43 ’s thoughts when considering his options			1
having captained @entity91 in 2012 , albeit at the wrong time for an out - of - form youngster , the 23 - year - old has already been picked out as a future leader			2
can he fulfill that role at @entity5 ? he ’s a regular starter , popular in the dressing room and a perfect professional			0
do n’t rule him out ... enter the dragon ? @entity88 was @entity5 's most influential player before injury last season @entity103 having progressed through the youth ranks @entity103 possesses the ‘ @entity105 ’			1
however , after his recent antics he does n’t quite fall under the role model category			0
the father - of - two has been pictured smoking and partying in @entity110 , while he has work to do to break back into this talented first xi after injury problems since his early promise			0
@entity43 is certainly a fan of the @entity116 - born midfielder though			0
‘ of course he will be one of the leaders of this club - in fact he is already on the pitch , ’ @entity43 said back in 2013			2
‘ i think @entity123 will be captain of this club this day - yes , of course			0
worth a risk ? @entity43 is an admirer of @entity103 ( @entity129 ) but there are doubts over his lifestyle @entity133 having been @entity5 ’s most consistent player over the last two years , the @entity135 international automatically qualifies as a candidate			1
not a leader as such - instead doing his talking on the pitch - @entity133 has built up a formidable partnership with @entity70 at the heart of defence			1
@entity135 fancy ? defender @entity133 is a guaranteed starter but is not a born leader @entity144 mentions @entity146 character , if nothing else			1
the selfie machine ( along with @entity149 ) keeps spirits high in @entity151 and has improved as a goalkeeper , but he must rank down the list			0
@entity154 , professionalism , one of the manager ’s favourites			0
@entity159 has stood in as captain on occasions but in truth does n’t play often enough to merit the position			0
glove affair ? goalkeeper @entity165 is popular in the dressing room but an outsider for the captaincy @entity169 longest serving player in this current squad			0
he ’s a regular starter , right ? watch out for ... @entity172 - @entity43 has high hopes for the 19 - year - old , who in his little experience at the club so far can already be seen organising his new team - mates from the back			1

@entity3 is close to *completing* a move to @entity10
@entity43 will have to *decide* who will be the next @entity23 captain

per @entity70 returns to the @entity33 as a @entity73 champion
@entity88 was the club 's most influential player before injury last term
@entity133 may not be a natural leader but is a certain starter
