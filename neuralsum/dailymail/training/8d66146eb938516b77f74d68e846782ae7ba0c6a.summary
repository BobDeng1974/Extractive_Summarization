a @entity1 homeless man is about to launch his own app after learning how to code through the generosity of a software developer who passed him every day during his commute			1
first announced on medium last month by software developer @entity8 , 23 , ‘ finding the @entity9 ’ came to him after seeing the homeless man , who goes only by @entity11 , on his way to work every day			1
the original proposal was this : mr @entity8 offered the homeless man two choices - $ 100 or a free laptop , wireless hotspot , coding books and daily coding lessons			1
@entity11 took opportunity over cash			2
programmer in training : @entity11 , a homeless man in @entity1 , is set to launch his own app after only four weeks of coding lessons ‘ i can go through $ 100 in a few days			1
in a week , ’ @entity11 told @entity24			2
‘ but he told me i could have a laptop and learn how to do something and i figured it could turn into something more			0
’ ‘ it 's really hard to convince people that you are not a bad person , or a drug addict or a crazy , ’ he added			0
‘ how are you gon na do that when you are homeless , and that 's how the homeless are depicted ? it 's not always a negative thing but people do n't know that			0
@entity11 worked for @entity42 until losing his job in 2011 , he told @entity44			2
out of work , he was priced out of his neighbourhood when luxury condos began to take over			0
he soon found himself in an unthinkable place – he was homeless			0
@entity11 's teacher : software developer @entity8 provided @entity11 with a laptop , coding books , a wireless hotspot , solar charger and gives him daily coding lessons this background perhaps helped @entity11 stand out in the sea of @entity1 homelessness			1
calling the poverty - stricken man ‘ a genious , ’ mr @entity8 wrote of the increasing awe with which he looked at @entity11 as he ; rattled off import / export prices on food [ and ] the importance of solar and green energy			1
’ ‘ he is smart , logical , and articulate , ’ the charitable developer added			0
@entity11 's classroom : this park , on the @entity69 , surrounded by a highway and construction sites , is where @entity11 learns to code @entity8 made a deal with @entity11			1
he would provide a @entity74 , a wireless hotspot , three coding books , a solar charger and something to hide the laptop in , as well as daily one hour coding lessons			1
the rest was up to @entity11			0
so it began , lessons started outside every morning at 8am sharp			0
in four weeks he ’s gone from having no idea what coding was to almost finishing his first app. ‘ yeah ! i mean , i thought coding was something that went over like , a dessert , ’ @entity11 told @entity24			1
@entity90 : this @entity74 is @entity11 's ticket out of poverty lessons start with a fifteen minute review of the day 's previously created code , which is stored on the website @entity97 , @entity8 told @entity44			1
lessons then go into a 15 minute rapid - fire coding session followed by 30 minutes of actual teaching by @entity8 , he added			1
the classes are taught outside in a park surrounded by a highway and a construction site			0
with the plan beginning to realize its goal , some feel that mr @entity8 is using @entity11 for his own fame , according to @entity44			2
when asked , @entity11 dismissed the notion			0
‘ i do n't really care about all that , what do i care ? i 'm learning something , right ? i know i 'm learning something and that 's what i care about			0
@entity8 's my man , ’ he told the site			2
man on a mission : @entity11 's app , set to launch in about a month , will address global warming and other environmental issues he cares about @entity11 would not divulge the details of his new app , other than to say it addresses global warming and climate change			1
the app is expected to launch in about one month , but @entity8 told @entity24 he 's looking even further into the future			2
' there 's a lot of need that became apparent through this , ' @entity8 said			0
' i would love to get the tools necessary to help some of these individuals and get them some of the information they are looking for regarding coding and opportunity			0

@entity8 came up with the idea after passing the homeless man every day on his way to work
the original proposal was $ 100 or two months of daily coding lessons , a free laptop , coding books and other tools
@entity11 is set to soon launch his first app
