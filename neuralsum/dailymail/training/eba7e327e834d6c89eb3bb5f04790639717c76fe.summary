the prime minister has come under pressure for his refusal to lift the ringfence protection from cuts given to the @entity12 while @entity13 has accused the coalition of failing to increase spending as promised			1
but new @entity17 data published today show real terms increases in @entity12 spending in each year since the coalition was formed			1
spending : new data released today shows how health spending has risen in real terms since 2010 - 11 , after the coalition was formed in may 2010 the figures , which cover actual spending from 2008 - 09 to 2012 - 13 , lay bare that the only cut in spending came in the 2010 - 11 financial year which began in the last weeks of the @entity13 government			1

it amounts to a 0.8 per cent rise in real terms year - on - year			0
in 2011 - 12 , health spending was 0.3 per cent higher than a year earlier			1
ministers are confident that over their @entity39 period , the government has continued to meet its promise to provide a real terms increase in the health budget			0
a @entity17 source said : ‘ because of tough decisions this government has taken on welfare we are able to increase @entity12 spending			2
‘ @entity13 claim protecting the @entity12 is irresponsible and would cut the @entity12 , like they have in @entity49 , where they are in charge			0
’ the figures will provide a major boost to mr @entity3 , who staked his personal reputation on a pledge not to cut health funding			2
promise : prime minister @entity3 has been under pressure to stick to his pledge on health spending during the 2010 election campaign the @entity62 leader appeared on a poster proclaiming : ‘ @entity65 cut the deficit not the @entity12			1
’ ahead of the @entity69 and spending review this year there were renewed calls to remove the ringfence from health spending			2
but mr @entity3 suggested he would never allow the @entity12 budget to be cut while he was prime minister			1
he said : ‘ when you look particularly at the @entity12 , you know that we have got an ageing population			0
‘ there is massive pressure on the @entity12 , more expensive treatments and drugs are coming through , and i just do n’t believe it is practical or right to cut the @entity12 , ’ mr @entity3 said in march			2
row : @entity13 shadow health minister @entity82 repeated the claim that the coalition cut the @entity12 in its first year ‘ as prime minister i am never short of advice			1
but there ’s one piece of advice i wo n’t take and that ’s the piece of advice that says you ought to cut the @entity12 budget			0
’ last year the coalition became embroiled in a public spat with @entity94 , the head of the @entity95 , over the claim to have increased @entity12 spending each year			0
he argued that ‘ expenditure on the @entity12 in real terms was lower in 2011 - 12 than it was in 2009 - 10 ’			1
but the coalition argued that the cut in 2010 - 11 was put in place by the last @entity13 government			0
in each year since mr @entity3 ’s spending plans have been in place , health spending has risen			1
however , shadow health minister @entity82 insisted that the complaint from mr @entity94 as still valid			0
he said : ‘ @entity3 famously promised he would cut the deficit , not the @entity12			2
‘ but we have it in black and white from the statistics chief : he cut the @entity12 in his first year in @entity110			0
‘ there could be no clearer evidence of the failure of this prime minister and his government			0
‘ this mismatch between @entity3 's promises and the reality on the ground can not be allowed to continue			0
these real - terms cuts explain why hospitals in @entity122 do not have adequate staffing levels and why over 4,000 nursing jobs have been lost on @entity3 ’s watch			0
