in a paper published this week , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity4 have cast doubt on what exactly was detected within the @entity7 signals detected from the @entity7 were hailed as conclusive proof that the ' @entity11 particle ' - the @entity10 - had been found after a quest spanning nearly five decades			1
a week after the discovery of a particle , believed to be the elusive particle , scientists at @entity4 have said they are not so sure			1
in a paper published this week , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity4 have cast doubt on what exactly was detected within the @entity7			1
' the new resonance discovered by the @entity22 and @entity23 experiments at the @entity24 ( @entity7 ) could be the long - sought @entity10 of the @entity25 , ' say the scientists			2
but the researchers point out that it 's far from certain that the particle is the ' standard model @entity30 ' which scientists have sought for decades to fill in the ' gaps ' in the model of physics we currently use to explain the universe			1
' we show that current @entity7 data already strongly disfavor both the dilatonic and non-dilatonic singlet imposters			2
' on the other hand , a generic @entity30 doublet and a triplet imposter give equally good fits to the measured event rates of the newly observed scalar resonance			0
' the researchers advise caution - and say that ' currently the uncertainties in these quantities are too large ' to make a definitive statement			0
scientists at @entity54 are also analysing the data further to see if their discovery corresponds to the ' standard model ' @entity30 boson - or to something more mysterious			1
one of the reasons for the caution at @entity54 is that while the new particle has so far behaved liked the elusive @entity30 boson it is lighter than expected			1
this opens up the possibility of there being more than one @entity10 and could lead to a new understanding of dark matter , the mysterious substance thought to make up a quarter of the universe			0
professor @entity30 , 83 , wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced , and later said : ' it 's really an incredible thing that it 's happened in my lifetime			0
' professor @entity77 , of @entity78 , who helped lead one of the two teams of scientists behind the discovery , said : ' this breaks the way to looking at a new vista in physics			2
it is a very exciting moment			0
' inside : the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed , and is buried 100m beneath the ground professor @entity30 appeared to wipe away a tear after scientists at the @entity7 claimed to have discovered a particle believed to be the @entity10 an aerial view of the @entity100 - @entity99 border , indicating the route of the @entity7 the @entity30 was proposed in 1964 - it is the last missing piece of the @entity25 , the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe			1
the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the @entity30 is the last jigsaw piece.if the particle was shown not to exist , it would have meant tearing up the @entity25 and going back to the drawing board			2
one of the reasons for the caution at @entity54 is that while the new particle has so far behaved liked the elusive @entity30 boson it is lighter than expected			1
this opens up the possibility of there being more than one @entity10 and could lead to a new understanding of dark matter , the mysterious substance thought to make up a large portion of the mass of the universe			0
the @entity10 's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. without this mass , they would zip around the cosmos , unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets – and people			0
despite its fabled properties , the particle has eluded previous searches and not all scientists believed in its existence			1
to try to pin it down , scientists at the @entity7 near @entity141 smashed together beams of protons – the ' hearts of atoms ' – at close to the speed of light , recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the @entity151			0
theory has it that as the universe cooled after the @entity151 , an invisible force known as the @entity10 formed			0
this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or @entity162 other particles pass through it , they pick up mass. in december last year scientists at the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) - the ' @entity151 ' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the @entity30			2
since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong .			0

' @entity181 ' over signal detected at @entity54
particle could instead be ' impostor ' , claim @entity4 scientists
@entity54 scientists to analyse data further
