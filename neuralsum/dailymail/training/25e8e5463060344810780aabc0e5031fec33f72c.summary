by @entity0 published : 15:12 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 01:03 est , 27 june 2012 groundbreaking : made by @entity1 , the $ 17.50 test is the only government - approved rapid hiv test that uses saliva would you go to a drugstore for an @entity9 test ? health officials want to know , and they 've set up a pilot program to find out			1
the $ 1.2 million project will offer free rapid hiv tests at pharmacies and in - store clinics in 24 cities and rural communities , the @entity12 announced on tuesday			1
officials are hoping testing for the @entity9 virus will become a routine service at drugstores like blood pressure checks and flu shots			2
' by bringing @entity3 testing into pharmacies , we believe we can reach more people by making testing more accessible and reduce the stigma associated with @entity3 , ' @entity12 's dr. @entity26 said in a statement			1
he oversees the agency 's hiv prevention programs			0
the tests are already available at seven places , and the @entity12 will soon pick 17 more locations			2
the hiv test is a swab inside the mouth and takes about 20 minutes for a preliminary result			1
the test maker says it 's correct 99 per cent of the time			1
if the test is positive , customers will be referred to a local health department or other health - care providers for a lab blood test to confirm the results , counseling and treatment			2
when the project ends next summer , @entity12 officials will analyze what worked well and what did n't , said @entity58 , the epidemiologist who is heading up the project			2
an estimated 1.1 million @entity60 are infected with @entity3 , but as many as 20 per cent of them do n't know they carry the virus , according to the @entity12			1
it can take a decade or more for an infection to cause symptoms and illness			0
pilot scheme : @entity68 's pharmacy manager @entity67 stands in her store in @entity70 , which has put up prominent signs advertising the tests since 2006 , the @entity12 has recommended that all @entity60 ages 13 to 64 get tested at least once , not just those considered at highest risk : gay men and intravenous drug users			1
but fewer than half of adults younger than 65 have been tested , according to the agency 's most recent statistics			1
it 's important to know about infection not only for treating the condition but also to take steps to prevent spreading it to others			0
an hiv diagnosis used to be a death sentence , but medications now allow those infected to live longer and healthier lives			2
on special occasions , health organizations have sent workers to some drugstores to offer @entity3 testing			1
this week , @entity68 — the nation 's largest chain of pharmacies — is teaming with health departments and @entity9 groups to offer free tests in 20 cities			1
subtle : @entity67 's pharmacy has put out stacks of special test request cards so that ustomer can very quietly request the test but the @entity12 program is different : it 's an effort to train staff at the pharmacies to do the testing themselves , and perhaps make it a permanent service			2
it 's such a new and novel thing for us , ' said @entity67 , who manages a @entity68 in @entity70 , that is participating in the pilot program			2
would you be prepared to take a free @entity3 test in your local drugstore ? at her pharmacy , prominent signs advertise the test but the testing is done in a private room			1
they 've also taken steps to make sure that a customer can very quietly request the test			0
for example , they 've put out stacks of special test request cards — they look like business cards — at @entity137 and nearby businesses			0
anyone seeking a test can simply hand the card to the clerk , she said			0
only three or four customers have gone through with a test in the first few weeks			0
' we get a lot of questions , ' she said			0
' usually they get the information and they go and sit on it and think about it			0
' there 's a second @entity68 in @entity70 offering the test , as well as branches in @entity157 and @entity158 , @entity159			0
other test sites include @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity166 and a federal @entity168 location in @entity169 , @entity170			0
other rapid tests on the market analyze a finger - prick blood sample and are used routinely in doctor 's offices each location will get enough tests to check 200 to 300 people			1
made by @entity1 , the $ 17.50 test is the only government - approved rapid hiv test that uses saliva			1
other rapid tests on the market analyze a finger - prick blood sample			1
rapid tests are used routinely in doctor 's offices , hospitals and clinics			0
the @entity1 test can also use a blood sample but the @entity12 drugstore program will use a mouth swab , said company spokesman @entity195			0
the stick - like testing device is used to wipe the inside of the mouth , then it is put in a solution			1
if two lines appear , that indicates a positive test			0
the company is seeking government approval to sell it over-the - counter for home testing			1
a decision is expected later this year			0
the test is sold in about 40 countries			0
@entity195 said he is not aware of another country where pharmacies routinely offer the testing .			2
