@entity0 looks to be heading to @entity1 , and could even be @entity3 ’s first signing for @entity4 , after an astonishing bust - up with @entity7 boss @entity6			1
@entity8 and @entity9 are leading the chase for the 27 - year old striker , after already making overtures about his availability , but @entity4 are ready to compete with them after he was included in their new manager ’s list of possible targets			1
either way , @entity0 is on his way out of the @entity23 champions after infuriating @entity6 with his attitude and being told by the former @entity26 coach : ‘ goodbye , and good luck with your next club			0
’ listen up : @entity0 , celebrating a goal against @entity4 earlier in the season , could be set to join them happier times : @entity0 and his @entity7 team - mates won the @entity23 before the @entity36 success the flare - up happened in the wake of a 4 - 0 champions ’ league semi-final second - leg defeat by @entity41 at the @entity42 that left the whole of @entity44 stunned			1
as he tried to make sense of it in the home dressing room afterwards , @entity6 launched into an emotional address to the players , in which he blamed himself for blundering over his team selection and getting his tactics wrong			0
every @entity7 player was visibly moved by his searing honesty , except for @entity0 , who evidently shook his head and met his manager ’s stare with a mocking smile			0
prize guy : @entity6 ( right ) watched his team win the cup after he left @entity0 out of the squad a furious @entity6 reacted by axing him from the squad that beat @entity64 2 - 0 in saturday ’s @entity36 final , even though he was fit enough to play			2
after settling on his line - up and substitutes last thursday , he went up to @entity0 , informed him he was being left out and wished him good luck with his next club			0
that could yet be united , after @entity3 apparently cooled on the idea of pursuing a move for @entity7 forward @entity74 , who likes to play in a withdrawn role , but set his sights on recruiting an out - and - out goal poacher , in the mould of @entity0			2
@entity8 , in particular , represent the biggest threat to his hopes , after responding to their @entity82 final triumph by promising @entity84 major transfer backing for a tilt at the @entity87 title next season			0
admirer : new boss @entity3 would like to have @entity0 in his ranks at @entity4			1

@entity0 could head for @entity1 after bust - up with @entity6
@entity8 and @entity9 have registered *interest* in the striker
now @entity3 is keen after taking over @entity4
