@entity0 , the world 's no 1 golfer , experienced an awkward moment when he went to watch @entity3 take on @entity4 in a rugby match on friday			1
the @entity3 supporter was in the middle of a television interview with the @entity9 when the @entity11 song ' @entity12 ' was played over the public address system at half - time			1
@entity0 responded by smiling sheepishly , looking down at the ground and exclaiming ' oh dear '			0
@entity0 went on to score a rare title hat - trick later in the season , reeling off three straight victories in the @entity26 at @entity39 , the @entity40 in @entity41 and the @entity42 in @entity43			0
the 25 - year - old is having some time off before returning to competitive golf in the new year			0
' i 'm in my off - season so i can enjoy myself , enjoy my @entity49 dinner and have a few drinks , ' said @entity0 with a big grin			0
@entity0 ( right ) ended his relationship to the tennis star in may before winning the @entity34 in may , @entity0 looks crestfallen as he faces the media for the first time since splitting up from @entity16 @entity16 had announced their engagement earlier in the year via her @entity59 account as for the match itself , the hosts got back to winning ways in the @entity21 and moved up one place to fourth but they were made to scrap every inch of the way against @entity4			1
@entity68 's visitors could have even snatched their first win in @entity70 since 1960 , but a tight and fairly dire affair ended 13 - 10 in the hosts ' favour			0
the entire game on a wet and cold night saw just two tries , with @entity3 winger @entity76 getting over in the first half and then @entity4 second row @entity79 crashing over in the second 40 minutes			2
@entity3 had led 10 - 3 at the break , but the westerners came back and , although they made off with a losing bonus point , will be rightly disappointed at not getting more from this one in a game which saw both sides missing front - line @entity86 players who had been rested			2
the result halted @entity3 's losing run of having been beaten in three of their previous four games , and got @entity93 's men back on track towards their aim of making the play - offs - even though the performance was well short of where it should have been			2
as well as winning two majors , @entity0 ( centre ) played a key role for @entity103 as they retained the @entity105 tennis star @entity16 ended the year as world no 8 following her split from @entity0			1

@entity0 was in attendance for @entity3 's @entity21 match against @entity4
golf star and @entity3 fan was paraded in front of the fans at half - time
during his tv interview ' @entity12 ' was *inadvertently* played
