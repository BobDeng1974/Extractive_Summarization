@entity1 's speedy teenager has done it again ; after smashing the country 's 100m under - 18 's record in september , @entity2 has come up with a new jaw - dropping record			1
the 16 - year - old scooped up a gold medal at the @entity9 in @entity10 on saturday , sprinting 100 metres in 10.13 seconds			1
although a 3.4 metre per second tailwind meant @entity2 could n't claim the time as a new record , the time was the fastest run by any @entity16 this year , regardless of wind			1
but the 16 - year - old is also not too far off the standard set by world champions of the likes of @entity30 , who ’s all - time fastest in the 100 metre sprint remains 9.58 , achieved at @entity32 in 2009			1
his time was also less than half a second slower than favourites such as @entity35 and @entity36 , whose fastest times remain 9.86 and 9.87 respectively			0
@entity2 , who was already ranked 1st in @entity16 's youth and ranked 6th in the world by the @entity40 for his 10.42 second run in october , told @entity42 that although he was happy with his new time , he 'd prefer to have achieved it legally			2
the @entity45 teenager sprinted 100 metres in 10.13 seconds - the fastest time run by any @entity16 adult or youth this year although a 3.4 metre per second tailwind meant @entity2 could n't claim the time as a new record ' it was a strong wind but hopefully i can go somewhere near that with a legal 2.0 … i have to do it legally then i 'll be happy , ' he said			1
' i am extremely pumped			0
the start was horrible ; it 's the first time very i have had someone to chase down which makes me happy and pushed me to a lot quicker time			0
' running neck - to neck with his competitor @entity63 in the first 60 - metres or so , it was n't until the last moment that @entity2 threw himself over the line first , with only 0.05 seconds to spare before @entity63 came second			2
the teen has been set as @entity16 's next big hope at the @entity69 since september when he first smashed the country 's 100m under - 18 record by running 100 metres in 10.44 seconds at a race meet in @entity73			1
the crowd watched on in amazement as a star was born on the track when @entity2 , who until this year only competed in long jump , also broke the @entity45 men 's open 100 metres record			2
@entity2 was already ranked 1st in @entity16 's youth and ranked 6th in the world by the @entity40 for his 10.42 second run in october the teen has been set as @entity16 's next big hope at the @entity69 since september when he first smashed the country 's 100m under - 18 record by running 100 metres in 10.44 seconds at a race meet in @entity73 when compared to @entity16 ’s fastest ever sprinter , @entity23 ( left ) , whose fastest time was 9.93 in 2003 , the difference is a matter of milliseconds – 0.2 to be exact			1
his time is also just half a second slower than the @entity94 of @entity96 's @entity95 ( right ) @entity2 's running time has also been compared to the personal bests of world champions such as @entity100 's @entity30 and @entity101 's @entity35 @entity2 , who was until recently a long jump specialist , says he has set his sights high in the sprinting arena			2
' at the moment i 'm not extremely serious about it , but in the future if i keep improving i 'll definitely want to take it to the @entity69 with a gold medal , ' he told @entity111			2
@entity2 's trainers were also impressed with his amazing performance calling it ' sensational ' and ' beyond what we were expecting '			0
@entity116 , from @entity1 , told @entity117 was already ' very talented ' for achieving such a great time so early on in the season			0
the teen first smashed the country 's 100m under - 18 record by running 100 metres in 10.44 seconds in september ' a young fellow , 16 - year - old , comes out of the winter , does a bit of winter training for the first time , already very talented , and is more than capable , although 10:44 is a bit beyond what everyone was expecting			1
' to achieve that so early in the season , at what many would say were the school sports , is absolutely astounding , and an outstanding performance by a young man who has only been known as a long jumper			0
@entity2 is part of a new crop of talent , some of whom recently returned from the world junior championships in @entity145			0
the @entity146 had supported young athletes who were able to access training tracks around the clock			0
until recently , @entity2 was a long jump specialist but now has his sights set on a sprinting career			0

@entity2 from @entity1 is setting his sights on @entity69 gold
the 16 - year - old clocked 10.13 seconds at the @entity9 in @entity10 on saturday
however he could n't claim it as a new record *due* to the *illegal* 3.4 metre per second tailwind
despite this , the time completely *surpassed* his previous time of 10.42 seconds in october
the schoolboy first broke the *national* under - 18 record in september with 10.44
