by @entity0 , political editor the ‘ @entity7 bounce ’ has propelled the @entity1 ahead of @entity2 in the polls , as voters backed @entity6 ’s bid to block @entity9 - fanatic @entity7 from the @entity11 ’s top job			1
the @entity1 have taken the lead with 33 per cent support – up five points in a week and two clear of @entity17 ’s party on 31 per cent , according to yesterday ’s poll			1
lord @entity19 , a former @entity20 deputy chairman whose polling organisation conducts the weekly survey , said the prime minister ’s outspoken but doomed protest was behind the surge in popularity			0
@entity6 was all smiles in the @entity28 this afternoon after @entity20 @entity29 read out the results of the @entity19 poll showing the @entity1 ahead of @entity2 the boost for mr @entity6 came as angry senior @entity1 branded @entity34 allies ‘ liars ’ , ‘ turncoats ’ and ‘ cowards ’ for failing to stick to their initial opposition to mr @entity7 , who was installed as @entity40 president on friday			1
mr @entity6 came closer to suggesting he would recommend a ‘ no ’ vote in a referendum on @entity11 membership if he fails to claw back powers from @entity45 before 2017			1
‘ i will always do what ’s in the national interest , ’ the prime minister told the @entity28			0
he conceded that renegotiating a looser , more trade - based relationship with @entity45 would be harder with mr @entity7 at the helm , but insisted he still believed it would be achievable			1
though @entity2 also opposed mr @entity7 , mr @entity17 said mr @entity6 had demonstrated not ‘ splendid isolation ’ but ‘ utter humiliation ’ after being out - voted by 26 to 2 on the question of his candidacy			1
‘ you returned to @entity57 on friday having failed			0
not some mild , small failure , but an appalling failure of relationship - building , winning support and delivering for @entity57 , ’ he said			2
the @entity62 have jumped to five points ahead of @entity2 in the latest lord @entity19 poll			1
1,006 adults were interviewed by telephone between 27 ¿ 29 june 2014 voters appear to have backed @entity6 's bid to block @entity9 - fanatic @entity7 , pictured , from the @entity11 's top job but the prime minister branded mr @entity17 ‘ weak , opportunistic and wrong ’			1
‘ i have to say i wo n’t take lectures on negotiation from the people who gave away the veto , who gave away the rebate , who backed down on the budget every year , and who even signed us up to euro bailouts , ’ mr @entity6 said			2
he was particularly scathing about @entity2 ’s decision to sign away @entity57 ’s right to block a candidate for @entity40 president in the @entity87 of 2001 , meaning the issue is now settled by a majority vote			1
‘ i believe the council could have found a candidate who commanded the support of every member state – that has been the practice on every previous occasion and i think it was a mistake to abandon this approach this time , ’ he said			0
‘ i insisted the @entity98 took a formal vote , something which does n’t usually happen			0
‘ facing the prospect of being outvoted , some might have swallowed their misgivings and gone with the flow , but i believe it was important to push the principle and our deep misgivings about this issue right to the end			0
’ despite the @entity62 being ahead in the voting intention , 32 per cent want a @entity2 government against 25 per cent favouring a @entity20 government in 2015 the prime minister branded mr @entity17 ' weak , opportunistic and wrong ' mr @entity6 said it was a ‘ bad day for @entity34 ’ which risked undermining national parliaments , but welcomed the decision to review the process the next time the position becomes vacant			1
he won strong support from the @entity20 backbenches			0
former minister @entity122 said : ‘ in a previous @entity124 , we saw off many @entity125			0
’ sir @entity126 said the prime minister had been ‘ completely right ’ in his approach to mr @entity7 ’s appointment			2
@entity20 mp @entity130 said mr @entity7 was a ‘ marked man ’ after the events of recent days			2
senior allies of @entity133 yesterday insisted a @entity57 exit from the @entity11 would be a ‘ disaster ’			2
@entity137 finance minister @entity136 , regarded as mrs @entity133 ’s closest ally , said the @entity57 was ‘ indispensable ’ to the @entity11 and that everything should be done to ensure the country remained a member state			2
‘ the @entity11 without the @entity57 is absolutely not acceptable – unimaginable , ’ he told the @entity142			0
dr @entity143 , a leading member of mrs @entity133 ’s @entity144 , told the @entity145 : ‘ it would be a disaster if @entity57 is going to step out of the @entity11 in @entity45			0
i can not imagine an @entity11 without @entity57			0
’ @entity20 @entity29 shouted ‘ because they ’re liars ’ when mr @entity17 asked why @entity137 chancellor @entity133 and other @entity11 leaders who were initially resistant to mr @entity7 ’s candidacy had changed their minds			1
@entity152 , a @entity153 former cabinet minister who is one of several senior @entity1 tipped as @entity57 ’s next @entity11 commissioner , praised mr @entity6 for ‘ not turning tail while our so - called allies were turning coats ’			1
health secretary @entity158 attacked the ‘ cowardice ’ of ‘ other leaders who were n’t prepared to stand up in public and say the things they had said in private ’			0
lord @entity19 said mr @entity6 ’s approach appeared to have resonated with voters			2
‘ the poll was taken between friday afternoon and sunday evening , when political news was dominated by @entity6 ’s stance against the appointment of the new @entity40 president			0
’ a separate @entity170 poll commissioned by @entity171 found that the proportion of @entity57 who would vote for the @entity57 to stay in the @entity11 has fallen by four percentage points in a week			1
the figure has dropped to 36 per cent , while 43 per cent would vote for @entity57 to leave the @entity11			2
few voters believe any of the main party leaders come across as ‘ someone like me ’ , according to a new poll			0
a @entity170 survey found that @entity183 leader @entity182 was seen as a kindred spirit by only 14 per cent of voters , just ahead of @entity17 on 13 per cent , @entity6 on 12 per cent and @entity186 on 8 per cent			1
the prime minister is viewed as the most intelligent , statesman - like political leader in @entity57 , while the @entity183 leader is the weirdest and most stupid .			0
