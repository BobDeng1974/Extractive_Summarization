by @entity1 reporter published : 19:15 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 06:03 est , 28 december 2012 superstorm @entity2 hit the @entity5 shore town of @entity6 hard - 60 homes were demolished when waves crashed over the sand dunes and swept into the small community			1
the water washed away the road leading to @entity14 's house and pummeled ten of his neighbors homes in a 200 - foot radius			1
but mr @entity14 's house endured			1
it was the only house in his immediate neighborhood left standing by the ferocious storm and it sustained only minor damage			0
devastated : @entity14 's house , center , was surrounded on all sides by water after @entity2 breached the protective sand dunes in his community stranding alone : mr @entity14 's house was built atop dozens of pine pylons that were sunk deep into the sand the @entity34 calls mr @entity14 's house ' the @entity35 ' - but closer examination reveals that the house remains standing because mr @entity14 took special care when building it and used design features meant to withstand a hurricane			1
now , @entity41 and the town of @entity6 are studying the home and could make some elements of its construction mandatory for all new houses that are built in the beach community			2
' the goal is to construct things that will stay around awhile , ' mr @entity14 told the @entity34 , ' and hopefully outlive you			2
' unlike his neighbors , mr @entity14 elevated his home and built it on top of 34 treated pine pylons that were driven 20 feet into the sand			1
the first inhabited floor is eight feet above the beach			0
and the walls in the ground floor , used as a garage and for storage , were made to collapse easily under the force of waves - saving the rest of the home			0
home sweet home : @entity14 looks around at the re-construction efforts from his house , which was largely undamaged by the storm planning ahead : mr @entity14 took this 1968 photo of flooding where he later built his house			1
he knew high water would come again and tried to prepare for it even the roof is designed with a hurricane in mind - long and sloping it faces north to ' shoulder the prevailing win , ' the @entity34 reports			0
when the storm came , the home did exactly what is was supposed to			0
the walls on the ground floor gave way and allowed the water to wash around the pilings - leaving the living spaces of the house mostly untouched			0
while his neighbors homes were swept off their foundations or blasted to splinters by the water from the storm , which hit the @entity5 coast on october 29			2
most of mr @entity14 's neighbors had only a small crawlspace beneath their houses , which provided no protection against the force of water			1
high water : a police boat patrols the water around mr @entity105 surviving house while his neighbors lost everything , inside mr @entity14 's house it barely looked as though a storm had ever hit			1
the refrigerator was ruined by water and a few floorboards were damp			0
houseplants had been toppled over and a few pictures were knocked off the wall			0
otherwise - the living space was untouched			0
' it was all in one piece , like we had just gone to eat , as if we had just gone out , ' mr @entity14 said .			2

@entity14 built his house on pylons eight feet above the sand
the home was designed to withstand flooding and strong winds , which is why it was left when his neighbor 's houses were washed away
ten homes within a 200 - foot radius of mr @entity14 's house in @entity137 , @entity5 , were destroyed
