@entity0 puffed out his cheeks and strode purposefully down the tunnel			0
he knew he had been in a game			0
@entity5 , the matchwinner and hero of the night , and @entity8 , a tireless worker in midfield , were walking gingerly , hobbling even			1
they had completed 90 minutes but it had taken its toll			2
this will have made happy viewing in the households of @entity16 and his @entity18 players , @entity20 ’s opponents on sunday			1
tighter than it has been for many years			0
too tight for comfort , by the end			0
@entity20 tend to stroll through this little technicality in their @entity27 programme , the qualification phase			1
manager : @entity88 6 referee : @entity90 6			0
attendance : 59,946 * @entity93 ratings supplied by @entity94 they were a goal ahead shortly before half - time but it afforded a false sense of security			1
having failed to score in @entity103 , their single goal did not alter the requirement for @entity36			2
an equaliser would still do it and as they went in search of one , so @entity20 ’s certainty faded			1
by the time the home side were reduced to 10 men with 15 minutes to go , it is fair to say panic was spreading , certainly in the stands			1
@entity20 are a better team than @entity36 , but they were terrifyingly vulnerable to a single aberration , a slack moment of marking or a freak , deflected equaliser			1
well outside their comfort zone , the fans bawled and screamed their frustration			0
to be fair , the anger over @entity49 ’s dismissal was misplaced			1
he was rightly booked in the first half for choosing to meet @entity78 with his shoulder , rather than challenging fairly in the air , and taking a yellow card into the second half his clumsy manhandling of @entity75 was always going to invite trouble			2
referee @entity90 , from @entity132 , showed a red and the @entity38 erupted , but it was more out of fear than justified indignation			0
@entity138 was then booked for coming on to the field prematurely as @entity0 sought to reshuffle the team , and may have a greater beef , but as @entity36 had been denied a very plausible first - half penalty , it is fair to say @entity20 got the best of any incompetence			1
it would have been a strange penalty , but no less warranted for that			0
@entity41 , who was exceptional bar this moment of madness and a miss after nine minutes that could have put @entity20 in early command , made a desperate lunge from behind in an attempt to stop @entity70			1
it was hard to identify specific contact at first , save for the coincidence of both men falling within a split second of each other , but replays showed that in going to ground @entity41 ’s hand had clipped @entity70 ’s foot and perhaps sent him tumbling			0
certainly , the circumstantial evidence would have convinced more than a few referees ; and they would have been right			0
nevertheless , @entity20 had the better of the chances on the night and would have felt hard done by had @entity36 progressed			2
even in a fraught second half , the best of it belonged to @entity20 and @entity5 in particular will be kicking himself for a miss in the 53rd minute which should have put the result beyond doubt			1
@entity49 also found the side - netting with a far - post header , @entity8 had an excellent chance blocked and @entity54 could have done better from close range			1
time to celebrate : @entity0 will celebrate 17 years in the @entity27			1
it was the 1997 - 98 season when a group stage last took place without @entity20 early bath : @entity49 was shown a red card in the second half after he picked up a second bookable offence chance : @entity41 had the opportunity to open the scoring for @entity20 in their clash against @entity36 , but he dragged his left - footed shot wide of the goal time to reflect : the @entity192 international holds his head in his hands after dragging his attempt wide after just nine minutes of the @entity27 play - off @entity198 the star man ... but 5/10 @entity55 was infuriating at times @entity201 : it 's now or never for @entity41 and he start to take his chances @entity204 : @entity5 delivers the goods ... but @entity20 need a target man against that , @entity36 will feel they had their moments , not least when @entity53 made a hash of a pretty straightforward defensive clearance , allowing @entity77 to seize the ball but plant it wide of @entity48 ’s goal			1
in the final minute of normal time @entity77 could not get his head to a cross at the far post , having lost his marker			0
had that gone in , there would have been no way back for @entity20			2
instead , they are in thursday afternoon ’s draw for the @entity27 proper , continuing a run of 17 straight campaigns			2
and , thanks to a warped seeding system , in @entity227 , just like the biggest clubs in @entity229 , those that win domestic leagues and continental titles			0
it ’s nice to be one of @entity229 ’s chosen few			0
the result was the best news of the night , obviously			0
for @entity0 , second best was the identity of @entity20 ’s goalscorer — @entity5 , the man tasked with pretending to be a striker for the months when @entity30 is absent with his broken foot			1
he is n’t a natural in the position by any means , maybe not even the solution if @entity0 ’s resolve wavers before the transfer deadline closes on monday , but his first goal for the club was a vital one and that can only build confidence			0
@entity5 ’s display in a forward role at @entity256 last saturday was unconvincing and his appearance as a lone striker here was seen as something of a gamble , but he got the last word			2
it was quite a test for him , after all			0
the final qualification tie for the @entity27 is no proving ground , with so much at stake and away goals counting double			2
suppose @entity20 required two , or even three on the night ? with @entity30 injured and the prolific @entity268 suspended there was a lot of weight on @entity5 ’s shoulders			1
to his credit , he rose to the occasion			0
he did n’t have much of a first half , and certainly did n’t apply the pressure in the area that @entity30 would , but when a chance presented itself he snatched at it , and in a good way			0
moments earlier he had overrun a pass from @entity41 to widespread groans , so it is to @entity5 ’s credit that he was instantly prepared to assume responsibility in front of goal again			1
contest : per @entity50 , who captained @entity20 in the absence of @entity290 challenges for the ball			2
the @entity292 was making his second appearance of the season london calling : former @entity297 and @entity298 striker @entity299 in action for @entity36 in the second leg of their @entity27 play - off tie against the @entity303 in the stands : @entity88 , who played for @entity305 and @entity256 during his time in @entity192 , watches @entity36 from the stands after he was sent off in the first leg on his marks : @entity5 takes a first - half free - kick , but it fails to test @entity66 in the @entity36 goal , falling comfortably into the goalkeeper 's hands @entity314 showed fighting spirit - @entity0 flying high : but @entity77 failed to make contact on the cross which surely would have sent @entity36 through to the group stages his moment came in the final minute of the half , after a headed clearance had found its way to @entity41			1
he played a nice one - two with @entity55 and looked to be shaping to shoot from the return pass			0
letting the ball run , however , took it into the path of @entity5 who decided to eschew politeness and have a go , first time			1
@entity5 struck his shot low and goalkeeper @entity66 could not get down quickly enough			2
ultimately , it was all @entity20 required			2
for the 17th season in succession a delegation from the club will arrive in @entity338 for the @entity27 draw			1
it was 1997 - 98 when balls were last placed in @entity229 ’s many pots without one containing @entity20 ’s name			1
princess @entity344 was still alive and a chap called @entity346 had just resumed working at @entity347			0
considering events at @entity349 on tuesday night and how quickly a football club ’s fortunes can change , @entity20 have every reason to be proud of that record			2
they might even allow themselves a little pat on the back and call it business as usual			0
what they can not say this time , however is that it was never in doubt			0
that little puff of the cheeks suggests @entity0 knows it , too			0
yellow peril : @entity20 defender @entity49 picked up his first booking after an airborne challenge leading with his shoulder in the opening half on the run : @entity55 canters down @entity20 's left - hand side , but his final ball was disappointing and the @entity37 side regained possession so close : @entity5 almost doubled his tally after 51 minutes at the @entity38 following a delightful through - ball from team - mate @entity41 let me take a selfie : @entity61 was back in the @entity20 squad for the first time this season after winning the @entity381 with @entity382 spilling over : @entity49 appeared to confront referee @entity90 at the final whistle before he is pulled back by team - mates ' @entity50 and @entity385 on his feet : @entity77 , who had a chance to score an equaliser in the latter stages , is consoled by @entity50 , and then a smiling @entity41 at the final whistle			1

@entity5 opened the scoring for the home side on the stroke of half - time ; his first goal in @entity20 *colours*
the hosts had to play the last 15 minutes with 10 men after @entity49 was sent off for a second booking
the @entity303 will go into the hat for the group stages of the @entity27 for the 17th successive season
