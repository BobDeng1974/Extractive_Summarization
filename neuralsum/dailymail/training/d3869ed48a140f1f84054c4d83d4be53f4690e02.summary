big spender : @entity1 ignored warnings his flagship free school meals plan would be so expensive that spending cuts on ' teaching and learning ' could be required , emails revealed yesterday the revelations prompted a former aide to mr @entity13 to accuse mr @entity1 of ‘ lying ’ to cover up the ‘ abuse of taxpayers ’ money ’			1
the correspondence was revealed yesterday after being leaked to @entity34 ’s @entity33 programme			0
when the @entity36 and other media tried to access the emails via a @entity40 request , the request was blocked on the grounds of cost , apparently after the direct intervention of @entity15 education minister @entity44			2
according to the leaked documents , a letter was sent by mr @entity13 to @entity47 , the @entity15 chief secretary to the treasury , on november 29 last year , saying the policy would cost more than £ 1.1billion over two years			1
‘ i am sure that you will agree with me that we must not risk forcing schools to subsidise meals by reducing their spending on teaching and learning , ’ he wrote			0
‘ i would be grateful for your assurance that my budget will be increased to fully cover the cost of this new commitment , as i am unable to fill any shortfall from within my existing budget			0
’ a week later , mr @entity1 made an announcement that an extra £ 150million had been found to fund free school meals , part of which came from unspent @entity67 maintenance funds			2
deputy prime minister @entity1 , pictured , railroaded through a controversial pledge to give free meals to all infant school pupils an email was sent from a senior civil servant at the @entity67 to the offices of mr @entity1 , mr @entity44 and chancellor @entity74 that morning , pointing out that the statement was wrong , and warned scarce resources may have to be diverted away from the maintenance of buildings and ensuring there are enough school places			1
it read : ‘ first , the £ 150million is less than the £ 200million we believe will actually be required to deliver this policy			0
‘ second , more importantly , the gap between the deputy prime minister ’s figure and the @entity88 funding will require our secretary of state to divert money from providing school places to meet basic need or from meeting urgent maintenance needs in schools			1
‘ both these scenarios are wholly unacceptable to this @entity67 and to our secretary of state			0
’ a second email sent to civil servants in the @entity88 said : ‘ i am concerned that there is a risk that the deputy prime minister and others are about to make public statements that suggest that the additional £ 80million for free school meals capital can be found from within the @entity67 ’s budget without an impact on other education capital budgets			1
‘ firstly , because this is not true , and secondly , because it will be relatively easy for people outside the @entity67 to see that it is not true			0
’ @entity111 , mr @entity13 ’s former special adviser , told the @entity112 : ‘ @entity1 has been lying about the announcement from the start to cover up the abuse of taxpayers ’ money for his personal ends			1
@entity13 was trying to safeguard taxpayers ’ money but @entity1 ignored him			2
’ @entity15 deputy leader sir @entity120 accused ‘ disgruntled ’ @entity14 opposed to the policy of deliberately leaking the information			0
according to leaked documents , a letter was sent by @entity13 , left , to @entity47 , the @entity15 chief secretary to the treasury , right , last year , saying the policy would cost more than £ 1.1billion over two years referring to mr @entity13 he said : ‘ i think it would do him some good if he actually put a bit of a constraint on some of the ideologues who are trying to undermine it and acknowledge that he has signed off this policy and fully supports it			1
’ mr @entity44 said : ‘ the funding package announced in december was agreed across government and the full amount of estimated revenue cost was transferred to the @entity67 from the @entity88 so that schools would not have to pay for free meals from their teaching budgets			0
‘ we also secured a capital settlement which does not involve any reductions in capital maintenance or basic need budgets			0
