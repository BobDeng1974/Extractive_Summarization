by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 02:25 est , 31 january 2013 senior police last night condemned moves to allow foreign officers to take charge of @entity6 forces , a change which they said reflected a ‘ paramilitary ’ and @entity10 style of policing			1
ministers are expected to open up the top ranks to candidates from countries such as the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to combat what they called an ‘ insular and closed culture ’			1
at the same time , middle managers from industry and the military will be allowed to enter the police at the rank of superintendent after intensive training			1
open door : under the new proposals ministers are expected to open up the top ranks to candidates from countries such as the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to combat what they called an ' insular and closed culture ' but the plans sparked fury among chief officers and staff associations			1
the @entity37 insisted there was no shortage of talent in the police and worried that existing officers would be frustrated in their efforts to seek promotion			1
sir @entity45 , chief constable of @entity46 , said : ‘ all chief constables have served on the beat , experiencing the reality of day - to - day operational policing with the public			0
‘ this is the model used by other countries who have followed the @entity6 system such as the @entity16			1
‘ the direct entry officer class model tends to be followed by paramilitary police forces such as the @entity59 crs or the @entity61 @entity60			1
’ relaxing the rules will end the historic principle that all officers enter the police at the rank of constable			1
those hired to become superintendents will undergo intensive training so they can be on the job within 15 months			2
plentiful : the @entity37 insisted there was no shortage of talent in the police and worried that existing officers would be frustrated in their efforts to seek promotion in addition , some graduates and other high - potential recruits will be fast - tracked to the rank of inspector			1
this could halve the amount of time it takes someone to reach the rank of chief constable – from around 25 years today			0
in theory it means someone who joins the police aged 19 could reach the top rank in their early 30s			2
the @entity97 said applicants for the top jobs would most likely come from countries with similar policing systems such as @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity17 and the @entity16			1
warning : chief constable of @entity46 sir @entity45 said : ' all chief constables have served on the beat , experiencing the reality of day - to - day operational policing with the public ' it justified the measures on the grounds that new recruits could bring in experience of other working cultures			0
the policy document which contained the proposals stated : ‘ when all the senior leaders in a sector have had only minimal exposure to other working cultures it may lead to a relatively insular and closed culture among those who reach the top of the organisation			0
’ the changes will help lure the ‘ most talented people ’ to join the police and attract the ‘ brightest and best ’ , officials said			2
policing minister @entity131 said it would be ‘ years not decades ’ before a foreign national took charge of a force in @entity136 and @entity137			0
he compared the moves to the decision to recruit a @entity17 , @entity140 , as the next governor of the @entity142			2
@entity143 , president of the @entity144 ’ @entity37 accused ministers of not valuing or trusting senior police leaders			1
he said : ‘ the home secretary ’s proposals send out a very strong message that the senior leadership of the police service is n’t valued or trusted or else she would n’t be wanting to bring in foreign police chiefs			2
‘ bringing people in at superintendent level , inexperienced , unqualified , will bring some risks with them			0
’ in 2011 , a row broke out within @entity158 over the appointment of the @entity160			0
some senior @entity161 pushed for the hiring of @entity163 , the former head of the @entity165 and @entity166 police departments , but sir @entity167 , the former chief constable of @entity168 , was appointed			2
the overhaul of recruitment rules was proposed by @entity171 in his review of police pay and conditions			0
they are likely to come into force later this year			0
mr @entity131 said bringing in new recruits would also allow forces to recruit more ethnic minority officers to senior ranks			0
he said : ‘ the issue of choosing our police leaders is of the highest importance to the future of the police			0
there will be a relatively small number of people coming into the police from other backgrounds , increasing the diversity of the police			0

ministers expected to open talks with candidates from @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18
those from other *professions* will be able to enter police as superintendents
@entity37 said enough talent in @entity6 forces
