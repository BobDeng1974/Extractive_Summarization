former manager @entity31 should be given a lot of credit for the way he managed the development phase , but the internal structure has allowed the likes of @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 to become a key part of the first team this season			1
@entity38 in particular has been one of the star performers in the @entity20 this season , scoring 23 goals in all competitions , and is expected to break into the @entity49 squad next month			1
