by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 15:50 est , 23 may 2012 a blind @entity1 , 69 , is accusing staff at a local hospital of negligence and racism after he emerged from open heart surgery with scars all over his body which appeared to spell out @entity9			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , had a heart attack last august and was rushed to @entity14			1
after surgery he was in a lot of pain			1
mr @entity10 said he told one of the male nurses he needed medication and claims he was abusive towards him			1
this was on top of the scarring from surgery			1
@entity14 police say they conducted an investigation but found no evidence of a crime			1
' i told them i had a confrontation with a male nurse while i was in intensive care , ' he said			1
' i was in so much pain , i begged him for pain medication			1
' he told me to shut my f * * * ing mouth or he ’d shut it for me			1
i did n’t provoke him			1
i did n’t disrespect him			1
' when he asked to be sent to a rehabilitation center because the pain was so bad , they said this was approved - but instead discharged him			1
on the day he was discharged , a nurse at the hospital told mr @entity10 that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his stomach and his back			1
the nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but could n't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars			1
she said to him : ' my conscience wo n’t let me be			1
it ’s bothered me for days			1
something was done to you , and i believe it was wrong			1
' i ca n’t sleep			1
i keep thinking about what they did to you			2
' his pastor came over the following day and took pictures of his abdomen and back and continued to throughout the healing process to document it			2
an open heart surgery wound is typically between five and ten inches long			2
there may be slight scarring or bruising from surgical tape around it			2
in mr @entity10 's case , he has deep wounds all over his stomach and some on his back			2
several of the wounds look in the shape of the letter @entity95 he told the @entity96 : ' you can see the surgery sutures , and they ’re clean			2
' but those three letters , two good - sized ks and one smaller one off to the side , had to be made with some sharp knife or heated instrument			2
it ’s like they branded me			2
' scars : mr @entity10 had an old wound reopened on his back and two more cuts above it			2
on his abdomen the letters @entity112 can be seen point out : a @entity115 video made about his story shows where the @entity112 letters are for those who do not recognize them			2
it was a nurse who first alerted mr @entity10 to the scars a friend of the 69 - year - old who made a @entity115 video about the case , said they also cut down through an existing surgery scar and carved two vertical lines above the older scar			0
this is what a scar from heart surgery should look like ( file photo ) the hospital have attributed the extra wounds to surgical tape or to infections related to his diabetes			0
since the video of what happened to the @entity1 was posted online , hundreds of people have expressed their shock and disgust over what happened and took to the streets on monday to protest			0
supporters , led by @entity150 founder @entity149 , marched for two miles waving @entity152 flags from rapid @entity154 plaza to the hospital where mr @entity10 was operated on			0
@entity155 , 69 , a resident of the @entity11 reservation , said : ' we ’re classified as second class citizens			0
but when they want our votes , we ’re their brother			0
' a group of about 15 people - including @entity149 and @entity165 vice president @entity164 - met with officials at the hospital , while police prevented other supporters from entering the building			1
the hospital released a statement saying : ' we believe the meeting with leaders of the rally yesterday provided an opportunity to learn more about each other ’s perspectives			0
' @entity178 is an organization of people who have dedicated our lives to healing others			0
we are deeply committed to providing excellent care to everyone , regardless of race			0
no one at @entity178 would stand by idly and allow abuse to occur in this hospital			0
' we proactively seek feedback from patients and we listen to their concerns			0
upon admission , patients are provided a document outlining their rights and who to call if they have concerns			0
@entity197 , directors , and supervisors routinely visit with patients , inquire about their care , and answer any questions			0
' our patient relations team works with patients to address individual concerns			0
additionally , we have a team of people who randomly survey patients about their care they received once the patient returns home			0
' in the rare instances when a patient has a complaint , we investigate it thoroughly			0
if a patient files a complaint with local law enforcement or an outside regulatory organization , then we fully cooperate in the investigation with all local , state , or federal agencies			1
' once again , in the absence of a written release , we are severely restricted from commenting on the care of any patient			0
we would welcome the opportunity to discuss the specifics of any case if allowed to do so by the patient or their representative			0
' we at @entity178 are confident of the care we provide without bias or consideration of race , religion , national origin or payer classification			0
' a justice for @entity240 page has been set up to highlight what happened , as has an online petition .			0
