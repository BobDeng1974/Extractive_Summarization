@entity12 survived successful surgery to treat a brain tumour and was responding well to chemotherapy at the @entity16 in @entity17 in february 2011			1
however , her condition deteriorated after she returned home a month later and she was taken to hospital feeling dizzy , lethargic and unable to walk or sit without help			2
@entity12 , two , died after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of an mri scan			1
she had suffered irreversible brain damage following treatment for a brain tumour @entity28 's parents , @entity29 and @entity30 , spent eight days pleading with doctors to treat their daughter , but crucial tests were repeatedly delayed			1
by the time the tests were carried out at @entity34 in south west @entity35 , @entity28 had suffered irreversible brain damage caused by water on the brain and emergency surgery could not save her			1
mr and mrs @entity12 first contacted the @entity16 and their local hospital in @entity34 raising their concerns about @entity28 's deterioration on march 18 , 2011			1
however , doctors said the symptoms were likely to be linked to the chemotherapy drugs and told @entity28 's parents to wait for a routine @entity23 , due some days later			1
@entity28 's parents @entity30 and @entity50 , pictured outside @entity51 , claim nine chances to treat their daughter 's symptoms were missed by doctors the scan showed signs of hydrocephalus - water on the brain - but @entity41 and mrs @entity12 were told by the @entity16 to take their daughter home			1
but @entity61 , a specialist oncologist at the hospital who was in charge of @entity28 ’s care , admitted he failed to discuss the results of her mri scan for three days - between march 21 and 23 - because doctors were n’t in			1
he said he discussed @entity28 ’s condition with doctors at @entity34 , who were also involved in her care , and urged them to give her a ct scan if her condition got worse			2
he told @entity77 : ' i did see @entity28 and informed @entity34 about the concerns			1
' we discussed numerous times with @entity34 that we were very concerned			0
if the patient shows any other signs of deterioration we must get a ct scan			0
' and he said he ' regretted ' not immediately referring @entity28 to @entity87 in south @entity35 , where she could have been operated on			2
but he said her rising temperature suggested she might have an infection and so he did n’t refer her			0
he said : ' there was a rising temperature that was concerning			0
it was @entity95 at that time			0
' i wish i had done that straight away , the reason i did n’t do it was because we have discussed with neurosurgeons those processes and the first thing they say is to make sure the infection is under control before they operate			0
' an inquest heard staff at @entity34 in south @entity35 failed to act on the advice of a specialist oncologist at the @entity16 in @entity17 , to give @entity28 a ct scan if her condition worsened assistant coroner @entity113 said he was concerned that a lack of communication led to crucial delays in @entity28 ’s care			1
he said : ' i ’m concerned there seems to have been a sequence of issues in terms of communication			2
' when @entity123 was seen on march 21 it was noted that she had some issues of unsteadiness			0
' i ’m finding it difficult to see why , if you went to the @entity23 department to discuss it on march 23 you were concerned enough to go and discuss it , but because there was n’t anyone there you left it until the next day			0
' then nothing happened on the next day you left it again until the @entity137 ( multi-disciplinary team ) meeting , but it was cancelled			0
' you say there was assistance requesting the ct scan , but that seems rather vague to me			0
' i ’m not sure there was a sufficient grasp on this			0
' within hours of leaving hospital in @entity17 her condition had worsened and she was admitted to @entity34 , vomiting repeatedly			0
but despite dr @entity61 's instructions , staff at the hospital failed to order a ct scan			0
and dr @entity61 failed to call a consultant at @entity34 to discuss the case , the inquest heard			0
in total , her parents claim that nine opportunities to act on the symptoms were missed			1
a few days later marked hydrocephalus - water on the brain - was eventually found , and urgent surgery ordered to drain the fluid to relieve pressure inside the skull			2
but there were further delays before @entity28 was operated on at @entity87 in south @entity35			2
further scans found that the water on the brain had caused irreversible brain damage , and she died in her parents ’ arms on march 30 , 2011			1
