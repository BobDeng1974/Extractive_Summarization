by @entity0 published : 08:59 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 10:47 est , 21 july 2013 they have been a common sight in circuses for years , but a pair of daredevils from @entity6 have taken the art of unicycling to new heights			1
@entity9 and his friend @entity10 have just completed a 9,000 - feet descent down the @entity13 mountain range in @entity14			1
it is the latest and highest challenge the @entity6 adrenalin junkies have tackled to date			1
@entity9 a student from @entity6 , said : ' it 's at times like this that i realise just how thin the line between success and failure can be			2
' riding down the @entity13 on a unicycle is a major challenge , even after more than 16 years of extreme unicycling			0
the terrain is particularly craggy and steep			0
on the edge : @entity9 and @entity41 dice with death for the love of their hobby and are often injured in the pursuit of the buzz beer : @entity9 says he likes nothing better when he reaches the summit than rewarding himself with a cold beer dismount : even the intrepid duo are sometimes forced to dismount and carry their unicycles when there is no other way through perilous : the pair have to bunny hop down sheer rock face and are often forced to leap off their unicycles during their descent ' the massive mental effort means that as time goes on , it gets harder and harder for me to concentrate			1
' but when i 'm enjoying my summit beer at the end , there is no better feeling in the world			0
' the 26 - year - old has been unicycling since he was just nine years old , is a pioneer of the extreme sport and has travelled the world to indulge his heart - stopping hobby			0
do n't look down : the duo , balancing expertly high up in the @entity13 , are just inches from death it is not the type of activity for the faint - hearted and the sport has even spawned its own terminology for the many injuries it can cause , such as ' shindentations ' ( marks where rocks puncture the front of the legs ) and ' calf tracks ' ( thin scars where the pedals cut into the back of the calves )			2
earlier in the year @entity9 and @entity10 paid a separate trip to the @entity98 's and filmed their perilous descent			1
speed demon : four times world champion @entity9 demonstrates what it 's all about @entity105 marks the spot : the duo take a breather and enjoy the view from the summit @entity112 landscape : the @entity13 are said to be particularly challenging due to its craggy surface safer ground : the pair back down at the foot of the mountain after their strenuous effort @entity120 power : the duo are often left injured by their exploits and the sport has even developed its own terms to describe the injuries they were sponsored by @entity129 , who funded a professional cameraman to record their unbelievably dangerous feats			2
the riders are often forced to bail on their one - wheeled machines , which have similar tyres to mountain bikes , if they take a spill during their hair - raising journey			1
record breaker : @entity9 ( right ) holds the world record for successfully completing a 6m drop			0
they have to ' bunny hop ' down sheer rock faces , fight to maintain their balance on the treacherous shale beneath them and teeth - grindingly pedal up arduous steep slopes			0
@entity9 is also the world record holder for the highest ever unicycle drop , landing a plunge from 6m of an overhanging rock in the @entity156 desert .			0

@entity14 mountains *provide* setting for a @entity6 pair 's biggest challenge yet
