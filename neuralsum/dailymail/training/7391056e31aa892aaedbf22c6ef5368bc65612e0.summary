' that 's something we continue to look at , as always making sure that the preparations we do on the pitch come first , ' said @entity0 managing director @entity48			1
' for many years of our ( pre-season ) international tours , there is a plan to ensure we get that team building that goes together with getting the team all together in one place			0
