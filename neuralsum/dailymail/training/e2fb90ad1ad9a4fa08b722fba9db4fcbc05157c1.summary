for while this @entity8 resident does have his own space - and at a bargain price - it measures a paltry five square metres			0
although he has evaded spiralling rents in the @entity13 capital by finding a home for just ¥ 40,000 ( £ 145 , $ 242 ) a month , he has been left surrounded by his own detritus			1
his humble abode even boasts a kitchenette - though he has to head outside to shower			0
and the intrepid resident even has space to invite a friend over - just			0
cosy : the flat 's occupant , who has not been named , can just about squeeze in space to sleep got company : despite his lack of personal space , the man is still able to invite a friend over stacking up : the man , nonetheless , has managed to cram a huge number of possessions into the tiny space what a mess : there is no space left to see the floor popping to the fridge : the apartment features and extremely cramped ' kitchenette ' sinking feeling : the owner may struggle to make much use of his kitchen facilities clutter : piles of boxes , as well as an aging computer screen , pack out one corner of the room boxing clever : the resident , who is not keen to get rid of any of his stash , has taken to building upwards toiletry shelf : the man has been forced to make good use of space to story all of his essentials , and non-essentials library : carefully piled up , the man 's extensive collection of sometimes - risqué literature is still accessible			1

*unnamed* resident pays £ 145 ( $ 242 ) rent a month in *notoriously* pricey @entity13 capital
but has nowhere to put his mountains of *rubbish* , piled all around the room
