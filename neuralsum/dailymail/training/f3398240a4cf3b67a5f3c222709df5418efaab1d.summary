or could they ? a developer has created a machine - learning algorithm capable of collaborating with one of the greatest writers of all time : @entity16			1
machine - learning software , dubbed ‘ fluency ’ , analysed the style of @entity16 's sonnets			1
@entity21 was then able to write a new sonnet choosing words from the suggestions generated by the algorithm when i in dreams behold thy fairest shade whose shade in dreams doth wake the sleeping morn the daytime shadow of my love betray ’d lends hideous night to dreaming ’s faded form were painted frowns to gild mere false rebuff then shoulds’t my heart be patient as the sands for nature ’s smile is ornament enough when thy gold lips unloose their drooping bands as clouds occlude the globe ’s enshrouded fears which can by no astron’my be assail ’d thus , thyne appearance tears in atmospheres no fond perceptions nor no gaze unveils disperse the clouds which banish light from thee for no tears be true , until we truly see according to @entity60 at @entity61 , @entity63 ’s machine - learning software , dubbed ‘ fluency ’ , was trained to learn the style of @entity16 ’s sonnets			1
the group ’s keyboard software is usually found in @entity70 mobiles learning the users syntax and style to help them type faster			1
using word suggestions generated by the algorithm , mr @entity74 was able to compose a new sonnet in the style of @entity16			1
‘ as might be expected from an artificial intelligence , the result is full of mixed metaphors , ’ mr @entity74 said , writing in @entity63 ’s blog			2
‘ but it was a fantastic start , and i could n’t wait to try it on other famous writers			0
’ as well as using @entity63 ’s engine , mr @entity74 also built a visual interface to help in poetry creation and named this project ‘ @entity90			2
’ using this interface , he was able to co-create poetry in the style of various authors including @entity95 and @entity96			2
using the @entity64 algorithm , mr @entity74 was able to co-create poetry in the style of various authors including @entity95 and @entity96 ‘ @entity100 rightly said that studied poets usually feel the presence of other writers ’ words , ’ said mr @entity74			1
‘ with @entity64 , i sometimes feel as if i have a backseat driver , one who never stops giving very specific suggestions			2
’ mr @entity74 does n’t see anything wrong with letting machines doing the hard work in composing poetry			0
he says a good arrangement of words will always resonate with someone			0
‘ i think i ’ll see a successful automated poet in my lifetime , ’ mr @entity74 told @entity61			0
‘ it wo n’t be easy : a poet is more than someone who makes poetry			0
yet that does n’t rule out algorithms , ’ he said .			0

machine - learning software , dubbed ‘ fluency ’ , analysed the bard 's style
same software is used in @entity70 phones to *predict* a user 's typing style
