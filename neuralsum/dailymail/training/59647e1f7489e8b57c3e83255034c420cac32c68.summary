the @entity0 are polishing up a determined bid to bring @entity2 back , finally removing from their website the scathing letter written by the team 's owner to fans after their star player chose @entity9 as a free agent four years ago			1
now with the @entity0 intent on luring the @entity15 , @entity16 , native back to @entity0 as a member of the 2014 free agent class , the @entity12 team removed an old link to @entity21 's impassioned letter that was active as recently as sunday			1
hours after @entity2 went on a nationally televised special to reveal his controversial decision to join the star - studded @entity9 rather than re-sign with his home - state @entity0 , @entity21 lashed out in anger			2
many happy returns ? @entity2 could move back to the @entity0 from the @entity9 the angry letter described the move by @entity2 as ' selfish , ' ' heartless , ' ' callous , ' and a ' cowardly betrayal ' - and vowed that a curse would deny him the championships he craved in @entity9 and that the @entity0 would win a title without him			2
the @entity12 fined @entity21 $ 100,000 for the comments			0
@entity2 went on to lead @entity9 to four consecutive trips to the @entity34 and two titles while @entity0 finished last in their five - team division three years in a row before a third - place finish last season			1
@entity0 's struggles , however , may have set the @entity0 up as an attractive team for a @entity2 homecoming as the high draft picks they garnered as a result allowed them to amass a core of talented young players			1
scathing attack : @entity0 owner @entity21 was not impressed when @entity2 decided to leave dumped : a poster of @entity2 ends up in the bin after hearing that he was leaving @entity0 recently reached agreement with premier point guard @entity52 , the 2011 number one overall draft pick , to a five - year extension worth about $ 90 million , and they used the top pick last month on high - leaping forward @entity57			1
with @entity2 retaining a home in the @entity15 area and strong family ties in the area , the @entity9 have been hard - pressed under the tight @entity12 salary cap to retool a team that were humbled in last month 's @entity34 by the @entity64			0
his ultimate decision could put the @entity12 's balance of power at stake and make whatever team he chooses an instant contender			0
hot picks : @entity0 have built a team of talented youngsters including @entity52 ( c ) @entity9 president @entity73 , who is expected to meet soon with @entity2 , said on monday that agreements are in place to sign free agent power forward @entity76 and small forward @entity78 as part of their push for the four - time league most valuable player			0
the slick passing @entity76 , 27 , averaged 8.5 points , 4.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game last season with the @entity90			0
@entity78 , a former all - star who has a career scoring average of 17.4 points over nine seasons , split last season between the @entity94 and the @entity95 and averaged 8.2 points and 3.2 rebounds .			0
