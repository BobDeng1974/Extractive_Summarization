you might see a piece of scrap paper when you look at that out - of - date tax disc stuck behind your current one … but @entity5 sees something precious			1
the 12 - year - old has amassed a 12,000 - strong collection of vehicle excise licence discs which is currently valued at £ 10,000			1
no surprise then that the schoolboy is incensed at the government ’s decision to axe the perforated bits of paper from october 1			1
@entity5 , from @entity25 , @entity24 has been collecting discs since he was seven , after spotting a colourful one on the windscreen of an abandoned @entity28			0
now he has thousands , dating from 1926 to the present day			0
his first discs came from cars in scrap yards after he begged his parents @entity34 and @entity35 to take him there			0
over 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since their creation in 1921 – if they were put in a line , they would go around the world three times			1
last year , the @entity42 issued 42.2million tax discs weighing over 72 tonnes – that ’s heavier than a challenger 2 tank			1
‘ i ’m always excited when i find old tax discs i do n’t have , ’ he said			2
the collecting of tax discs – known as velology – can be lucrative			2
anything pre- 1940s can make up to £ 100 on @entity51 and even discs from the 60s and 70s can command a tenner			1
@entity5 said : ‘ i keep my collection in date order in folders			2
some of my favourites are from the 1960s , 70s and 80s , as they have nice colours and are well laid out			0
‘ just because the tax discs are being stopped does n’t mean i ’m going to stop collecting			2
there are still so many more i want to collect			0
’ as well as his impressive disc collection , @entity5 has also collected 600 car hubcaps			0
mr @entity5 , 58 , said : ‘ @entity5 loves all paraphernalia relating to the motor trade – he is very knowledgeable			0
‘ he will even call out if there is a discarded hubcap on the road and i ’ll have to pull over and pick it up so he can add it to his collection			0
’ tax discs will be axed from october 1 - this wednesday - angering @entity5 , despite the expected increased in value of his extensive collection @entity5 's oldest car tax disc , which expired on september 30 , 1926 , could be worth more than £ 100			1

@entity5 , 12 , has collected the tax discs for around five years
his collection is valued at £ 10,000 - and should increase when discs are axed
the schoolboy 's oldest discs date back to 1926 and are worth about £ 100
the perforated bits of paper will be put out of service on october 1
