by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 10 april 2013 respect : the @entity3 flag flies at half mast in front of the @entity6 after the death of @entity8 , in @entity9 on monday @entity10 is open to the idea of renaming the capital of the @entity3 in honour of @entity8 , as long as the idea is backed by islanders , @entity14 said yesterday			1
the @entity17 revealed yesterday that senior mps are suggesting that @entity9 , also known simply as @entity19 , should be renamed @entity20 in honour of the woman who liberated it in 1982			1
they include ministerial aides in the @entity25 and the @entity26 , and cabinet ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the idea , if it wins the support of the @entity3 government			0
@entity33 mp @entity32 and former education minister @entity34 were among those backing the campaign yesterday , with the latter saying : ‘ count me in			1
’ there were initial discussions in @entity40 yesterday on ways to commemorate @entity8 , including renaming the @entity3 capital			0
‘ the prime minister thinks it ’s a good idea to think of how in due course @entity8 could be commemorated , ’ a spokesman said			1
‘ with regard to @entity9 , it would be a matter for the @entity3			1
’ another @entity14 source said the prime minister was open to the proposal but stressed that he believed the views of the islanders had to be ‘ paramount ’			2
@entity19 is currently named after @entity19 , who was the @entity55 prime minister three times in the mid- 19th century , but never actually set foot in the @entity3			2
appreciation : a group of former @entity55 paratroopers who fought in the @entity63 salute as they leave a wreath for @entity8 by a street sign in @entity9 in her name after hearing of her death on monday renaming it after @entity8 would infuriate @entity71 ’s erratic president @entity70 , who has been upping her rhetoric over sovereignty of the islands around the 30th anniversary of the conflict			1
but bookmakers offered odds of 5/1 that islanders would agree to bestowing the honour on the woman who many still hero - worship			1
@entity84 , the mayor of @entity86 , said he would also like a statue of @entity8 erected in the capital - though some mps fear it could become the target for left - wing protests			2
mr @entity84 insisted that the former prime minister deserved a ‘ prominent ’ central @entity86 memorial , and refused to rule out using an empty plinth in @entity96 to honour @entity55 ’s only female prime minister			1
guided tour : former prime minister @entity8 ( centre ) looks around the @entity3 in january 1983 the fourth plinth has never been permanently filled , but since 1998 it has been used to show a series of artworks			2
' the prime minister thinks it ’s a good idea to think of how in due course @entity8 could be commemorated ' @entity14 spokesman defence secretary @entity107 said : ‘ i think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to @entity8 somewhere in @entity86			0
' i have n’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be , but certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options			0
‘ let ’s look at that in slower time , i think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event			0
’ support : prime minister @entity10 ( pictured on monday ) is open to the idea of renaming the capital of the @entity3 in honour of @entity8 , as long as the idea is backed by islanders , @entity14 said commander @entity127 , a lt commander on the @entity128 during the @entity3 conflict , said : ‘ let ’s have a full scale statue next to @entity132 to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation			1
' i think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to @entity8 somewhere in @entity86 ' defence secretary @entity107 ' it was n’t just the navy that she was a champion of ; she was there for all the services			0
she was a great @entity143 , let ’s put her at the centre			0
’ @entity3 veteran @entity146 agreed : ‘ i think we should celebrate all that she brought back to this country			0
i think it would be terribly fitting if we could remember her in a similar way to @entity153			0
’ but he warned a statue could become the focus of protest : ‘ i think that you have to be careful of the reaction of the foolhardy , the misled and the misguided who have been popping champagne corks and dancing on her photo			0
