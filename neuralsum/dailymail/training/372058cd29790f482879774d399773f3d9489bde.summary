by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 15:26 est , 30 august 2013 the brother of @entity3 author @entity2 was tonight cleared of causing a pensioner ’s death by careless motorway driving			1
@entity8 ’s @entity7 ploughed into the back of 73 - year - old @entity10 ’ stranded @entity11 , killing her outright and sending her car spinning down the road in flames			1
she had been stuck in fast - flowing motorway traffic after being unable to get her car going again following an earlier jam on the southbound @entity18 near @entity19 , @entity20			1
trial : @entity10 ( left ) , 73 , was killed when her stranded @entity11 was struck from behind by @entity8 ( right ) ’s @entity7 on the @entity18 near @entity19 , @entity20 , in july 2012 mr @entity8 , a 48 - year - old professional lorry driver and logistics co-ordinator , had been driving from a doctor ’s appointment to his work in @entity26 , @entity20 , when the crash happened , just before 10am on july 18 last year			1
in his police interview hours after the crash he told officers : ' i just did n’t see this car			1
i just hit this car in lane two			1
' i did n’t expect this car to be in lane two			2
@entity8 is the brother of @entity2 - author of the best - selling @entity3 series ' people who look at the @entity7 think ‘ well , he drives like @entity42 ’ , which i do n’t			1
' as an experienced @entity45 driver he said he was used to driving in lane one of the motorway at no more than 56mph and that when in his own car he would travel between 60 and 70mph			2
however , prosecution and defence experts concluded that before the crash he had been driving at a minimum speed of 70mph			0
the defendant also said that he normally drove in lane one of the motorway and that the fact that he was in lane two meant he must have overtaken somebody			0
beyond that he had limited memory of the tragic events			0
he said : “ all i remember is just looking and realising this car is stationary			2
“ i think i tried to swerve			0
i do n’t think i even had a chance to brake			0
” he informed officers he drove ' the best part of 50,000 to 60,000 miles a year all across @entity66 ' and had never had an accident			0
prosecutors argued that other drivers had seen and managed to avoid @entity71 ’ car but he had not			2
the defence countered that by pointing out that a witness described a number of near misses , one driver had not seen the obstruction but had it pointed out to him by his passenger and another suspected had the neighbouring lane not been free for him to swerve into , he would have hit the @entity11			1
mrs @entity10 , a retired orthoptist and golf club president from @entity82 , in the @entity80 , was on her way to @entity84 in @entity85 , to visit her daughter and grandchildren			1
when she realised there was a problem she called her husband @entity90 , who told her to contact the @entity92			2
fireball : the collision 's force sent mrs @entity10 's vehicle spinning along the southbound carriageway of the @entity18 , before it burst into flames another motorist pulled onto the hard shoulder and dialled 999 and a @entity102 worker then turned a camera and zoomed in on the @entity11 , only to watch helplessly as the @entity7 slammed into it seconds later			1
following the verdict , judge @entity105 said : ' if ever there was a case for a jury , this was it			0
' adding that it had been a distressing case for both families , he asked everyone to leave the court in silence as a mark of respect to mrs @entity10			1
neither mr @entity8 , of @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity20 , nor the @entity10 family wished to comment as they left the court , in @entity123			1
mr @entity8 ’s older sibling , @entity124 , wrote the erotic novel @entity3 which became a global sensation last year , selling more than 70 million copies			2
wreckage : @entity127 told the jury as an experienced lorry driver he was used to driving in lane one @entity131 , who had been driving his @entity132 320 along the same southbound carriageway , told the court : ' that section of the @entity18 is quite windy and as you come round to that particular junction your visibility is only 200 to 300 yards			1
' i was in lane two and i became aware of a vehicle that was n't moving particularly fast but i was n't aware as to whether it had come to a complete stop			0
' i was about 150 to 200 yards behind when i realised it was n't moving at all			0
' i braked very heavily			0
if i had n't braked so heavily i probably would n't have stopped in time			0
' he changed lanes , passed the car and pulled onto the hard shoulder and dialled 999			0
the witness said he could not remember seeing any hazard lights on on the @entity11 when he was approaching from behind but did see them flashing when looking back at it in his mirror from the hard shoulder			2
investigation : @entity8 told police after the crash : ' i did n't even have time to brake ' he saw a woman aged in her 60s or 70s inside , who appeared to be either looking at the dashboard or slumped forward			1
' vehicles were missing the car narrowly , ' he said			0
' the motorway got very busy very quickly and it became more and more difficult for cars to avoid her			0
' he did not see the impact itself but was aware of the @entity11 suddenly shooting forwards and then spinning and being on fire			1
other motorists remembered seeing the vehicle but only becoming aware of it seconds before either having to pass it or before the collision			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
