by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:10 am on 27th september 2011 confusion : @entity7 , pictured during her speech at the @entity6 conference , made an embarrassing radio gaffe today deputy labour leader @entity7 appeared to back defeated @entity10 brother @entity9 for prime minister today in an embarrassing slip during a radio interview			1
she immediately corrected herself and said she hoped that @entity10 , who beat elder brother @entity9 to the leadership , would spend 10 years at @entity16			1
the mistake comes as the two brothers are still under intense scrutiny for any signs of rivalry or ill - feeling after last year 's bruising leadership contest			0
asked on @entity24 's @entity25 whether she thought @entity6 would have a female leader within the next decade , ms @entity7 said : ' well i hope we can get @entity9 ... ' cutting herself off as she began to say ' elected ' , she paused briefly before going on : ' i hope we will get @entity10 elected as prime minister for the next election and then he will be 10 years as prime minister , so not in the next 10 years , no. ' despite having the most support among @entity34 , @entity35 and rank - and - file party members , @entity9 lost the election to succeed @entity37 after his younger brother swept up votes among the unions			1
until then , @entity10 had always been junior to his elder brother in the @entity6 hierarchy			2
at this year 's party conference @entity9 has attended only one event , and he will be in the @entity45 while @entity10 makes his leadership speech tomorrow			1
spot the difference : ms @entity7 confused @entity6 leader @entity10 , right , with his elder brother @entity9 while setting out the case for the @entity6 leader and deputy leader duo always to include a woman , ms @entity7 said she wanted the top role to be occupied by the present leader for the next decade			2
' i want our current leader to succeed and he 's a man , ' she said			0
asked who she thought might be @entity6 's first woman leader , she refused to say			0
' it 's like asking a woman , " who is going to be your second husband ? " if you are still on your first you do n't want to discuss the second one , ' ms @entity7 said			0
' it 's just not a conversation you can have			0

' i hope we will get @entity9 - er , @entity10 elected as prime minister ' , she tells @entity25
