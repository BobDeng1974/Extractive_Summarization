the father - of - two , from @entity14 , @entity15 , a life - long boating enthusiast and keen traveller , was sailing from @entity18 in @entity5 to @entity11 when he , a fellow crewman and their 45ft trimaran , @entity22 , disappeared			1

the seven week search involved not only the @entity41 and @entity5 authorities but also @entity42 , police forces in @entity8 and the coastguard of almost every country around the @entity46			0
boats and planes had scanned the @entity46 for weeks trying to trace the trimaran , and its two man crew - skipper mr @entity2 and an unnamed friend			1
mrs @entity10 , 65 , from @entity51 , @entity14 , had raised the alarm when the pair did not turn up to meet her as arranged in @entity12			1
she had travelled in a self - converted camper van , with pet dog @entity55 , down to @entity11 and was expecting to join up with mr @entity2 sometime around october 10			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' i last spoke to @entity2 on a mobile on october @entity59 had just left @entity18 in southern @entity5 in the trimaran and was sailing across to @entity11			1
' he said everything was fine and the weather was lovely			0
it 's about a 450 mile journey and it would take a sailing boat on average five days so when a week had passed and they had not arrived i started to get worried			0
' happier times : mr @entity2 had been missing since the start of october when he failed to rendezvous with partner @entity10 , pictured , in @entity11 , @entity12 discovery : his body was discovered last thursday , floating in the @entity24 , more than 280 miles from where the trimaran was picked up by a @entity27 cargo ship mrs @entity10 , a grandmother of two , alerted the coastguard and by october 15 a full search and rescue operation was underway			1
she stayed in @entity12 for three weeks , hoping for news but eventually decided to return home			2
on november 8 in @entity78 while waiting for the next day 's ferry back to @entity80 she received a phone call saying the wrecked red and white trimaran had been found by a @entity27 cargo vessel , partially submerged near to @entity84 , the smallest @entity5 island in the @entity86			2
both outer hulls had been ripped off , the wheel and mast were gone , puncture holes dotted the central hull and the rope was wrapped around the propeller			0
' it was still a shock and i burst into tears , ' said mrs @entity10			2
' from the damage reported i did doubt whether @entity2 was still alive			2
but i did still hold out hope			0
' then last friday i had a visit from the police who told me @entity2 's body had been found off the coast of @entity33			1
arrangements : an autopsy has been carried out in the @entity33 capital , @entity36 , and relatives are hoping to repatriate the body ' i think the reality of it only hit me then			0
to be honest i was not expecting him to be found but i am pleased that it was because it is closure			0
' i just ca n't believe i will never see him again			0
we had some wonderful times on that boat and @entity2 was such an experienced sailor , what has happened seems unbelievable			1
' the couple met at @entity120 around 10 years ago after mr @entity2 , took up diving			1
a widow , mrs @entity10 said she was immediately intrigued and soon became smitten with this larger than life character			2
' he was like no one else i 'd ever met , very courageous , very strong and forceful			0
he was adventurous , he loved life , he loved travel and he loved sailing			0
' he was originally from @entity128 and his family owned a large wooden skiff which they all used to holiday on			0
he learned to sail on that and from then always had a love of boats			0
' he had a number of river boats and two sail boats before buying the @entity138 about 11 years ago			0
' there were only three of her kind made and she was designed as a racing yacht			0
' the couple lived together in @entity144 , latterly spending more than half the year abroad , sailing around the @entity46 , first @entity145 and @entity146 then @entity5 , leaving the boat when they returned home			0
