rating : we had envisaged waking up to the sound of @entity3 ’s pealing bells and were sorry when our taxi from the station went through the beautiful city centre , past the famous @entity7 - and then continued out the other side			1
although @entity10 is only half a mile from the city walls , you are either in @entity3 or you are not			1
and instead of bells , at one point we endured chants from the nearby @entity16 football stadium			0
we arrived at 2pm and needed to dust ourselves down before heading out to meet friends for a birthday lunch - a quick turnaround in other words			2
a slice of classic @entity23 hospitality : @entity24 occupies a leafy residential street in @entity3 unfortunately , the receptionist had other ideas			1
she told us in no uncertain terms that check - in did not start until 3pm			2
i pushed it a little because the hotel has 20 rooms and we thought one of them might be available , but she was n’t budging			2
in fact , i thought she might send me to the castle dungeons if i asked anything else			0
but then the manager appeared , a far friendlier no - nonsense @entity41 woman			2
come in , take a seat : the hotel lounge is fitted out with comfortable sofas , wide windows and wooden flooring she announced that our room was ‘ good to go ’ and handed us the key			0
we were on the first floor with a view of a boarding house for nearby @entity54			0
the high ceilings and large bay window drew in the flinty @entity41 light ; the @entity59 - style bed was inviting ; there was a wife - pleasing - sized dressing table and spacious wardrobe			0
@entity66 might call it quaint			0
@entity68 markets itself as the former ‘ townhouse home of a @entity59 gentleman ’ , which is a touch misleading given that it ’s really two suburban red - brick buildings			1
bright and breezy : the hotel offers rooms with high ceilings and broad windows that draw in the light it felt a little like a provincial doctor ’s surgery , only with tourist leaflets rather than copies of @entity87 to read while waiting			0
but it was comfortable and its owners have clearly made huge efforts to spruce up the place			0
breakfast is taken in a spacious modern conservatory - but it was full when we stumbled down and so we took our full @entity99 in the drawing room , which we had to ourselves			1
it was just what we needed ahead of a day roaming @entity3 ’s bustling streets			1
@entity104 4 - 5 @entity105 @entity106 @entity3 @entity107 01904 640 101 @entity108 double rooms from £ 79 , @entity110 rating :			1

pleasingly old - *fashioned* hotel occupies two red - brick properties in @entity3
the hotel stands outside the city *'s* famous walls , but loses little for this
the hotel has no restaurant , but serves a *traditional* @entity120 breakfast
