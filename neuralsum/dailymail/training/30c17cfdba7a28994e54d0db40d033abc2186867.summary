when you look at @entity2 and @entity3 , you know immediately they are football superstars			0
but with his shirt untucked and socks round his ankles , @entity5 looks more like a schoolboy playing in the playground			1
but make no mistake , he is absolutely lethal			0
sometimes his touch can be scrappy and he does n’t go for fancy tricks , but he ’s so effective			0
how many times does he pop up in the right place at the right time ? that does n’t happen by accident — he is aware of where he needs to be and does whatever it takes to get there			0
@entity31 as well as reading the game so well , @entity5 has the technique to go with it			1
he is quick , strong and good with both feet ; he can just as easily bend one in the top corner as scuff one in from close range			1
he ’s good in the air , holds the ball up well and brings team - mates into the game			1
workaholic : @entity5 in action during the quarter - final win over @entity47 in @entity48 @entity49 @entity5 is unique in that you do n’t really know his best position			1
he ’s not quite a striker , not quite a winger			0
you could play him as a no 10 or an old - fashioned inside - forward			0
but wherever he ends up he ’s dangerous			0
how would @entity57 use a player like that ? because he does n’t catch the eye and his skills are n’t as apparent , he might not even get a chance			2
@entity63 for getting the best out of such a versatile player			1
start of the rout : @entity5 took advantage of awful @entity68 defending to score @entity70 's opening goal @entity71 one thing you are guaranteed is a huge amount of effort			1
even if things are n’t coming off , he gives everything for his team and it rubs off on the rest of the side			2
their work ethic is fantastic			0
@entity85 wonder it 's the pinnacle of the game , so you do n’t score 10 goals in two tournaments without being something special			2
@entity5 was young player of the tournament and @entity94 winner in @entity95 and is one game away from being player of the tournament in @entity68			1
@entity5 ’s one of those players who thrives on this kind of pressure			2
he is a tournament specialist and he is clearly enjoying himself in @entity68			0
not far behind : @entity104 's team - mate @entity103 looks ready to beat his goals record record - breaker @entity104 just broke the all - time @entity85 scoring record with 16			1
@entity5 is only 24 but he ’s already got 10			2
that is an unbelievable achievement and i fully expect him to go on and beat his team - mate ’s record .			0

@entity5 looks more like a schoolboy playing in the playground
the @entity70 star is quick , strong and good with both feet
the versatile , team player will is looking to be a hero as @entity70 face @entity121 in the @entity85 final on *sunday*
@entity5 has been named on the *shortlist* for the @entity126 award , and could also win the @entity94 gong
