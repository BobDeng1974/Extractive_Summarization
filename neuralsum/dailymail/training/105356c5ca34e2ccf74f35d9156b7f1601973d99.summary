by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:51 est , 16 december 2013 @entity3 : 16:11 est , 16 december 2013 a new photo of @entity5 has been released as the ailing former leader met with a @entity8 reporter about current events for more than two hours last week			2
a photo of the discussion appeared in official media monday after days of speculation about the former @entity16 president 's health , fueled when he did n't comment publicly on @entity19 's death			1
the former @entity21 president was a close ally , thanks to @entity16 's backing of @entity25 fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid @entity21 government of the 1980s			1
keeping up appearances : former @entity16 president @entity5 met with reporter @entity29 on friday and the two men covered a variety of topics over the span of more than two hours the photo shows @entity5 , 87 , seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit , looking intensely at writer @entity29 and gesturing with his left hand			1
mr @entity29 and the website @entity37 say the photo was taken friday			0
the reporter told the @entity41 that he and @entity5 discussed a wide range of topics including @entity19 , @entity45 politics and climate change			2
' i found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood , physically , mentally and psychologically , ' mr @entity29 said			0
@entity5 left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006 , handing his duties to his brother @entity53			1
mr @entity29 has written extensively about @entity5 and late @entity45 president @entity54 , who died of cancer last year			0
the shake seen around the world : president @entity58 shook @entity16 president @entity60 's hand moments after addressing the crowd at @entity19 's public memorial ' he 's interested in everything			1
the environment , the climate crisis , @entity64 , @entity45 , @entity21 , ' @entity29 said of @entity5			2
' ' i found him alert , on top of current events			0
' we spoke a lot about @entity54 , ' because friday was the 19th anniversary of the two leaders ' first meeting			0
' it 's clear that @entity5 has n't forgotten him and maintains great affection for him , ' @entity29 said			0
big moment : it was later revealed that @entity81 and @entity16 representatives had been in secret talks for six months leading up to the @entity19 memorial while @entity5 has been out of the spotlight due to his health , his brother @entity53 has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking president @entity58 's hand during the public memorial ceremony for @entity19 in @entity21 last week			1
besides the obvious optics that came with the handshake was also the revelation that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months			0
during the president 's trip back from @entity21 , deputy national security adviser @entity98 told reporters on @entity102 that ' it 's been quite some time since the presidents of the @entity81 and @entity16 were even in the same place			1
' but he acknowledged that ' weâ € ™ re in talks on issues associated with migration that , again , i think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among @entity114 and @entity16			0

former @entity16 leader , 87 , had not been seen for months and *surprised* many by not putting out a *statement* following @entity19 's death
@entity5 and @entity19 were allies for many decades
his brother @entity53 attended the @entity21 memorial *service* instead
