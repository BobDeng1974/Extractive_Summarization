conjoined twin brothers who share three legs , intestines , a bladder , liver and genitals are today preparing for major life - changing surgery to be separated			1
surgeons in @entity9 will perform the operation to separate @entity11 and @entity12 , who are joined at the pelvis			1
the five - year - olds share three legs , their intestines , a bladder , a liver and their genitals , which will be divided out during the procedure			1
the boys , from @entity21 in @entity9 , will be separated at the hips and each will be left with just one leg , their third leg being used for vital skin grafts			1
the operation carries a high risk , but concerned parents @entity29 and @entity12 , both teachers , decided to go ahead to enable their sons to finally become independent			1
the boy 's mother @entity29 , 37 , said : ' when i talk to them about the big surgery , they say they want to be separated			1
it 's not just mine and my family 's will , it 's theirs too			2
' they want to be independent			0
they want to make their own decisions about where to go			0
' i know i 'm not imposing anything on them			0
' @entity11 and @entity12 are currently undergoing treatment in @entity64 to stretch their skin with silicone expanders			1
the procedure will create enough excess skin to stitch up the chest , stomach and pelvis of each boy after the difficult separation			1
their mother , said : ' every day i am more confident that day is nearer			2
the doctors are very positive , they are very hopeful because the skin treatments are working			2
' @entity80 dr @entity79 , who will be performing the separation surgery , has cared for @entity11 and @entity12 since their birth in april 2009			1
he said : ' this is a complex case			0
we 've gone through a lot with these children , so the risk goes up a lot			0
' the separation itself is not majorly complicated to do , for someone with the experience			0
' what makes this very complicated , apart from the separation , is the post- op. ' we do n't know how they 're going to react , in terms of their metabolism			0
there are no studies about that			0
' after the high - risk operation @entity11 will be left with two kidneys , while @entity12 will have one , and only one of the boys will have genitals , meaning further reconstructive surgery will be necessary @entity80 dr @entity79 said : ' this is a complex case			1
we 've gone through a lot with these children , so the risk goes up a lot			0
what makes this very complicated , apart from the separation , is the post-op ' @entity29 found out that she was having conjoined twins five months into her pregnancy following a scan during her second trimester			1
devastated , the mother - to - be and her husband struggled to cope with the news , worrying not only for the health of the babies but for her health too			2
hurriedly the couple sought out the best doctor who reassured them @entity29 would n't suffer or be in danger during the pregnancy			1
despite their concerns they made the decision not to abort the pregnancy and the boys were born without any complications four months later			2
after the birth , @entity29 stayed in hospital for 22 days learning special ways to bathe and breastfeed her newborns			2
the mother - of - three said : ' the doctor said it was one of the most complicated cases he had ever seen			2
' it felt very emotional after the birth , i always imagined how they would look like , but actually seeing them was a very different experience			0
' @entity29 - who already had a daughter @entity154 - struggled to adjust to caring for the twins			1
she added : ' initially it was difficult			0
up until they were four months old they cried a lot			0
they would spend all night crying			0
' sometimes one is really energetic and awake and the other one is sleeping			0
but they do n't bother each other			0
the boys have already been into hospital to have their skin stretched ahead of the surgery , which will take place in the coming months @entity29 , who is also mother to @entity154 , pictured with her brothers , said : ' i 'm looking forward to it , i want their lives to be better , and i do believe that day is coming ' ' one never wakes the other up , they let each other sleep			1
' when they were younger that bothered us			0
because if they were awake at different time , it meant we had to be awake at all times			0
and although they have spent their whole lives together , @entity11 and @entity12 have very different personalities			1
' we do notice there are a lot of differences between the two of them , ' @entity29 said			2
' each of them has a distinct personality - one is more tough and the other a little sweeter			2
they are both lovely though			0
' sometimes they want to play at different things , or go to a different place , and we have to try and make them understand that they have to compromise			0
' the final separation surgery is expected to take place in a few months ' time and @entity29 is focusing on thinking positively			1
she said : ' now we 're really just waiting for separation surgery			2
' i 'm looking forward to it , i want their lives to be better , and i do believe that day is coming			1
' @entity11 and @entity12 's story appears in the new series of @entity211 , which airs on thursdays from september 4 , at 9pm on @entity212 .			1
