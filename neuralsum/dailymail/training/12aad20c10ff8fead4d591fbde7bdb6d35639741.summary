by @entity0 a rare spitfire that saw action in @entity3 and then starred in two blockbuster war films is up for sale for £ 1.5 million			1
the 1943 @entity6 has been hidden away in a barn in @entity8 for the past 40 years and is being put up for sale by its current owner - @entity10 , a stunt pilot from the film @entity11			1
mr @entity10 has owned the plane when he received it as down payment for his role in the 1969 classic film			1
@entity10 ' @entity16 , right is selling his @entity1 which featured in the movies @entity11 and the @entity18 while seeing action during @entity3 before serving with the @entity21 and @entity22 air forces mr @entity10 , right , was a stunt pilot during the filming of the two movies and kept the aircraft as payment the aircraft last flew in the 1970s but is in remarkable condition for its age and could be returned to the air the fighter also featured in the 1962 film @entity18 about the d - day landings			1
now in his 80s mr @entity10 has decided to sell the plane with @entity35 , a worldwide company which specialises in the sale of ' war - birds			1
' although it last took to the air in 1973 , it had been stored in dry conditions and suffered little rust or corrosion			2
and once fully restored and made airworthy it could be worth over £ 4 million			1
@entity45 , co-owner of @entity35 , said this barn find was very rare			2
he said : ' i think it is very rare			0
to find a @entity1 that has served in @entity3 , served in the @entity49 , the @entity50 , and starred in two films - i do n't think you will find an aeroplane with much more history than that			1
' it is the original plane , and has not been refurbished or restored			2
it even has the same horse hair under the seats that the fighter pilots would have sat on in @entity3			1
' this is unlike other planes that you may find these days that have been restored , or never seen action			2
i think it is worth much more as an historical artifact than something that has been cobbled together with spare parts			2
' mr @entity10 flew the @entity1 during many of the battle scenes in the @entity11 , pictured the aircraft was built in 1943 and was deployed to 129 squadron based in @entity75 , @entity76 describing the plane 's rich history , he added : ' it was built in 1943 by @entity79 and went into action in the summer of 43			1
' it served with 129 , 229 , and 622 squadrons with the @entity83			0
it was then sold to the @entity49 and ended up in the @entity86 conflict , before serving with the @entity50			0
' after starring in two films , @entity18 , and @entity89 , it ended up in a barn in @entity8 in the 1960s			1
' it was on the ranch of one of the stunt pilots from @entity89 , who took it as down payment for his role in the film			2
' he has a landing strip on his ranch and he flew the plane for a couple of years			2
but since then it 's been in his barn , so for 40 - odd years			1
' the plane was built in the summer of 1943 at the @entity108			2
the plane , which was called @entity109 , was delivered to @entity110 at @entity75 in august 1943 , where it was issued with the squadron codes dv * @entity112 the plane was sent into action from day one flown regularly by squadron leader @entity114 , a @entity21 who fled when his country was overrun in the @entity117 's @entity116			1
the aircraft 's cockpit is in remarkable condition despite being 70 years old and not been used for 40 years two months later @entity109 was transferred to @entity121 where it continued to take part in the fighting , and was moved around the country several times , including being part of the fleet at no. 126 squadron at @entity129 , @entity76			1
in august 1946 @entity109 , along with several other @entity1 , were sold to the @entity22 government where it was based in @entity131 , @entity132 , before being sold on to the @entity50 in april 1953			0
it was sold to @entity21 company @entity133 , who worked with @entity136 forces , in june 1956			0
in 1961 it was leased for film use in @entity18 , which was filmed on location in @entity139			0
the aircraft was painted in camouflage and flown with 340 ( @entity139 ) squadron codes @entity142 @entity109 had by this time been purchased from @entity133 by @entity145 in @entity139 , where the aircraft was in open storage for some years			1
between 1966 and 1968 the plane was used in filming for the @entity11 , filming scenes in @entity150 , @entity139 , and @entity151			0
after the cameras stopped rolling it was shipped to @entity154 , @entity8 and last flew in 1973			1
the aircraft last flew in 1973 and has its @entity156 from the @entity83 detailing its exact history fully restored , and in flying condition the aircraft could be worth as much as £ 4 million to the right buyer mr @entity45 said they know so much about the history of the plane because the current owner looked into it			1
he said : ' the owner of the plane , a gentleman in his 80s , hired an historian to look into the plane 's history			2
' we have the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) from the @entity83 which tells you all about the planes history , where it served and where it was based and what operations it was involved in			0
' the historian went to @entity176 to look at the record books between 1943 and 1944 to find out more about the plane 's history			2
so we now know what operations the plane went on , who was piloting it , where it flew , if it was shot at , among other things			0
' it 's amazing to think that these sort of records still exist			0
people also knew about the plane and spent their time researching , and there are a lot of plane enthusiasts out there who have written about it on the internet			0
' so we have an overwhelming amount of information about it			0
' the plane was listed on @entity203 's website and @entity205 page on wednesday and mr @entity45 said it has had an amazing response			0
he said : ' we put the listing on @entity205 48 hours ago and we 've had thousands of likes or shares on @entity205 since it went up			0
' at one point we had 348 people visiting our website from 17 countries at the same time			0
it 's amazing to think it 's had so much attention already			0
i think this is the most interest we have ever had			0
' he added : ' it may have been in the barn for 40 years but it was in good dry conditions , so there is no rusting , or corrosion			1
but obviously , it was in the barn so when we looked at it , it had an inch thick of dust and cobwebs on it , but that was all			0
' the plane is worth £ 1.5 million but i think if someone wanted to restore it , restore the propellors , the engine and things like that i think it would be worth £ 4 million			1
' with the amount of history it has - serving with the @entity83 , being in the @entity11 film , and the amount of interest we have and the love people have for @entity1 - i could see it making its way back to the @entity255			0
