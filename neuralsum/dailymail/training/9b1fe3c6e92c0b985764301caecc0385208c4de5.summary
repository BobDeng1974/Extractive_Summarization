by @entity1 reporter published : 05:15 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 22 may 2013 one of @entity3 's main newspapers has published its entire front page ' in the language of @entity6 ' as the row over the encroachment of @entity9 in the country deepens			1
under the 1994 ‘ @entity16 ’ law the use of foreign languages in @entity14 classes is all but banned			1
the @entity14 daily liberation made the editorial decision to print its front page in @entity9 in support of a growing campaign to allow its use in the classroom			1
taking a stand : left - leaning daily newspaper liberation left little doubt which side of the argument its on with its front page the contentious issue has split many as new proposals suggest relaxing the current rules			0
the left - leaning newspaper pulled the stunt to demonstrate its stance in favour of the rules being relaxed			0
with a simple headline reading : ' let 's do it ' , the newspaper left its readers in little doubt of where it stands in the debate			0
unfortunately , not all readers will have understood the statement being made , as there was no translation into @entity14			0
but many in @entity3 strongly believe that the increasing use of @entity9 in the classroom will lead to the deterioration of the country 's own language			2
journalist @entity56 told thedrum.com : ' if we allow @entity9 to be introduced into our universities and for teaching science and the modern world , @entity14 will be vandalised and become poorer			2

use of @entity9 in classrooms is currently all but banned under @entity16 law
@entity67 pulled stunt to show support of proposed law changes
but many argue increasing use of @entity9 is *detrimental* to @entity14 language
