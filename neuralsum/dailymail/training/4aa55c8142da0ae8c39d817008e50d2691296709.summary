a small bowl of porridge each day could be the key to a long and healthy life , researchers have found			2
a major study of more than 100,000 people for more than 14 years found that whole grains reduce the risk of dying from heart disease			1
they say a daily 28 gram serving of whole grains was associated with a 5 % lower total mortality			1
each serving of whole grains also cut deaths from cardiovascular disease by 9 %			1
whole grains are cereal grains that are not refined and contain the ' germ ' , or seed embryo , which is packed with nutrients			2
examples of whole grain foods include whole - wheat or rye bread , brown rice , whole grain pasta , and breakfast cereals such as muesli and shredded wheat			0
although whole grains are widely believed to be beneficial for health it is the first research to look at whether they have a long - term impact on lifespan			0
researchers followed more than 100,000 people for more than 14 years monitoring their diets and health outcomes			1
eating whole grain foods reduces death rates from heart disease , but not cancer , a study has shown			1
scientists looked at data on more than 74,000 women and 43,000 men to investigate associations between whole grain consumption and death risk			0
over a period of more than two decades , a total of 26,920 deaths were recorded			0
after adjusting for factors such as age , smoking and body mass index ( @entity59 ) that may have influenced the results , the researchers found that people who ate whole grains were less likely to die than those who did not			2
every daily 28 gram serving of whole grains was associated with a 5 % lower total mortality			1
each serving of whole grains also cut deaths from cardiovascular disease by 9 %			1
however , there was no evidence of an impact on cancer death rates			0
writing in the journal @entity74 , the authors , led by dr @entity76 , from the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , concluded : ' these findings further support current dietary guidelines that recommend increasing whole grain consumption to facilitate primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease and also provide promising evidence that suggests a diet enriched with whole grains may confer benefits towards extended life expectancy			2

@entity103 , senior dietician at the @entity104 , said : ' this is an interesting study and reinforces existing dietary recommendations to eat more foods high in fibre			0
' but this study did n't look at what might be the cause of the link between eating whole grains and reduced death rates for cardiovascular disease			1
' people with a higher intake of whole grains also tended to have a healthier overall lifestyle and diet so it might not be the whole grains alone that are having the benefit in relation to cardiovascular disease			1
' but at this time of year when we are all making resolutions to eat better , switching to whole grain versions of bread , breakfast cereals , pasta and rice is a simple change to make			0
