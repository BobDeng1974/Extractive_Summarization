shop closures are turning high streets into ‘ ghost towns ’ with clothes shops , building societies and mobile phone stores most likely to put up their shutters			1
stores closed at the rate of 16 a day , a total of 3,003 , across 500 main shopping centres during the first six months of this year , a study found			1
at the same time there has been a fall in new tenants filling the gaps , so many outlets remain empty – and a magnet for vandals			0
the changes are being driven by a switch to buying on the internet , with @entity23 families spending more online per person than in any other nation			1
high street stores are closing at an alarming rate as shoppers spurn them for retail parks and the internet a survey by business services and accountancy firm @entity32 found a net fall of 406 shops across 500 town centres in the first six months of this year – compared with 209 in the same period in 2013			1
