by @entity1 reporter published : 22:47 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 22:51 est , 19 june 2013 the percentage of @entity4 men who work or are actively searching for work is at an historic low			1
men between the ages of 25 and 54 now participate in the workforce at only around 88 percent			1
in 1956 , 98 percent of @entity4 men were active in the workforce			1
due to a changing job marketplace , the @entity14 , male imprisonment and other factors , a fewer percentage of men are now working than ever before			0
vanishing act : men aged 25 to 54 who participate in the @entity4 workforce are at an all - time low according to @entity22 data among the less educated , reports @entity23 , men have been increasingly left behind as employment opportunities require more skill or a level of education beyond a high school degree			1
pair that with a widening dearth of well - paid manufacturing jobs and men with lower education levels are at an even greater disadvantage			1
college educated men are also vanishing from the workplace			0
analysts report that men 25 and up with a bachelor ’s degree participated in the workforce at 80.2 percent in may 2012 , an over 7 percent drop from ten years ago			1
even in boom years , like those that preceded the @entity14 , men ’s participation rate continued to fall despite unemployment reaching a 30 - year low in the early 2000s			2
going down : men 25 to 54 now account for less of the @entity4 workforce than ever before			1
male participation rates have dropped steadily for decades , and the descent quickened with the onset of the @entity14 changing places : men with lower levels of education are increasingly choosing not to work at all instead of taking labor jobs that once paid much more			2
meanwhile , women continue to make up more and more of @entity4 's workforce the rate of workforce participation in @entity4 -- that is , those who are working or searching for work -- has decreased for men aged 25 - 54 for decades for several reasons			1
education : fewer jobs exist for those with only a high school education and many men who could once hold well - paid manufacturing jobs , for example , now choose not to work at all instead of taking less desirable , and lower paid , blue collar work that still exists imprisonment : incarceration rates have increased exponentially in recent decades			2
1 in every 100 @entity4 are now in prison , over 90 % of whom are male			1
disability : with the @entity14 came a large influx of application for disability benefits and few of those who subsequently received them have since weened themselves off and the @entity14 itself exacerbated the problem			0
as the crisis grew , men ’s workforce participation dipped below 90 percent for the very first time			1
and it has continued to drop since , despite an improving economy			2
another factor is the number of men behind bars			2
an astonishing 1 out of every 100 @entity4 are imprisoned and over 90 percent of inmates are men			1
and , perhaps even more than lack of education , a criminal record can make finding a job in the afterlife of incarceration challenging			0
challenging enough , perhaps , to make men just stop trying			0
which is another growing group of non-participators			0
workforce participation accounts for employed people as well as those seeking employment			2
it does not , of course , account for those who ’ve stopped trying to find work altogether , such as those collecting unemployment or other benefits			0
‘ the proportion of guys doing nothing has risen , ’ @entity121 , a senior fellow at the @entity122 , told @entity23			0
after unemployment rates rocketed as a result of the recession , many men began to rely on unemployment benefits			0
they also , increasingly , began relying on the federal disability system			0
@entity23 reports that 1.9 percent of working age men received disability benefits in 1982			2
in 2012 , that number had reached 3.1 percent			1
and only 2.2 percent of those enrolled quit the program by the start of 2013			0
there are still jobs out there , of course , even in a harsh economic climate			0
so who ’s taking them in the absence of male applicants aged 25 to 54 ? economic woes : with the @entity14 came a great deal of lay - offs and though numbers have bounced back somewhat , the male workforce participation rate hit 90 percent for the first time and has continued to drop ever since women , according to @entity154 economics professor @entity153			1
female college enrollment rates have helped boost their ability to gain employment in sectors that are growing , ones that require higher education degrees			0
according to @entity153 ’s research , women born in 1975 were roughly 17 % more likely than their male counterparts to attend college and nearly 23 % more likely to complete a four - year degree ‘ women 's persistence and enrollment rates have given them a real edge over men , ’ said @entity121 .			0

in 1956 , 98 percent of males 25 - 54 participated in the @entity4 workforce
in 2012 , that number had dropped to 88 percent and it is *n't* improving any time soon
