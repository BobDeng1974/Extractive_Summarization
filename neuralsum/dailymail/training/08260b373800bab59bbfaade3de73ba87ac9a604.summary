by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 powered @entity3 to a 10 - wicket win over @entity5 in their @entity7 tour match as they chased down 127 in just 9.1 overs at @entity10			1
the home side 's 126 for seven , anchored by 63 from @entity11 , was never likely to provide too stiff a task for the world champions but they could not have expected to be blown away in such fashion			1
@entity1 scored 73 off just 31 balls with 16 fours while @entity2 contributed 52 off 24 deliveries with five sixes			2
driving force : @entity21 hit a magnificent 73 not out from only 31 deliveries at @entity10 easy does it : @entity2 raises his bat after making 50 , as the @entity26 swept to victory pulling away : though @entity5 's 126 was never enough , @entity28 may be concerned about @entity3 's form up and over : @entity2 smashed five sixes in his 52 not out at a rate of more than two runs per ball @entity5 got off to a brisk start after winning the toss and were 25 without loss after three overs but @entity38 ( 11 ) was the first man to go as he got a leading edge off @entity40 and @entity1 claimed the catch			1
that brought @entity43 to the crease and he helped the @entity45 reach a rather pedestrian 60 for one at the halfway stage but he also fell for 11 , caught in the deep by @entity48 off @entity49			0
@entity50 lasted just three balls before nicking @entity52 to @entity53 and at that stage @entity5 were 67 for three			0
@entity55 helped @entity11 , who brought up his 50 with a huge six , steady the ship but the scoring rate was still slow and the former was gone for 14 in the 17th over			0
the wicketkeeper was dropped by @entity61 but fell the very next ball when he top - edged @entity40 to @entity63			0
that prompted a late flurry of wickets and @entity11 's 45 - ball effort was ended as he found @entity48 off the bowling of @entity52			2
@entity69 hit : @entity38 smashed @entity53 for a huge six before being removed by @entity40 for 11 caught out : @entity55 was caught by @entity70 for 14 as the @entity5 innings stalled danger man : @entity40 took 2 - 20 in his impressive spell , as @entity5 struggled to maintain momentum resistance : @entity11 , who made 63 , was the only @entity5 batsman to make any sort of impression @entity78 was then bowled by @entity79 in the final over before @entity81 was run out as @entity5 posted a total which always looked chasable			1
and @entity3 wasted no time in setting about their task , with @entity2 launching a six and a four in the first over before @entity1 hit four consecutive boundaries in the second			2
two further @entity1 boundaries opened the next and @entity2 clobbered three consecutive big sixes as @entity3 reached 63 without loss in just four overs			1
@entity1 brought up his fifty with a four in a sixth over that cost 16 runs and the boundaries kept coming with the tourists bringing up their 100 inside seven overs			0
a single in the ninth brought @entity2 his 50 in just 22 balls and @entity1 sealed an emphatic victory with a four soon after .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 chase down 127 in just 9.1 overs
@entity11 made 63 in @entity5 's 126 - 7 , but @entity3 ease to win
@entity3 play @entity28 in one off @entity7 on *tuesday* evening
