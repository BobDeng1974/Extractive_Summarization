a baby who was diagnosed with cancer before she was even born has survived a dangerous operation and a gruelling round of chemotherapy , and has beaten the disease			1

now enjoying her first @entity13 , the baby 's cancer is finally in remission following weeks of chemotherapy			1
brave : baby @entity10 , now nine months old , was born with an enormous tumour on her neck her mother @entity20 , 38 , who lives in @entity21 with husband @entity22 , 38 , said : ' it was such a massive shock to us both when we were told that @entity10 had this neck cancer			1
' she was still inside me and had n’t even been born yet , yet i was being told that my baby had cancer			2
' when i saw the massive tumour on her neck when she was delivered , i could n’t believe just how big it was			2
' she was such a tiny baby and yet she had this massive tumour on her neck			0
i just had to pray that she would be able to survive			0
' mrs @entity10 , 38 , suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage two years before becoming pregnant with @entity10 but her joy soon turned to terror			1
cancer : the tumour was spotted when her mother was 32 weeks pregnant and cancer diagnosed after birth harrowing : her parents @entity42 and @entity44 from @entity21 feared their daughter might not survive ' i was overjoyed that i was pregnant again , ' remembers mrs @entity10			1
i went for my scan at 12 weeks and doctors said there was a good strong heartbeat that that was a relief			0
' then on the 20 week scan everything looked fine too so i was just looking forward to becoming a mum at last			0
' after developing diabetes during the pregnancy , mrs @entity10 had another scan at 32 weeks to make sure her daughter was developing normally - but was horrified when doctors spotted the tumour			1
‘ we were devastated when we were told what was the matter with our baby , ' she says			0
' we did n’t know whether she was even going to survive			0
’ mrs @entity10 was referred to the @entity62 in @entity63 and when her waters broke at 34 weeks in march , she was rushed straight into the operating theatre			1
the birth proved equally traumatic , with doctors forced to cut a hole in @entity10 's throat to insert a breathing tube midway through the delivery			1
beating the odds : the little girl had her first operation during birth and another a few days later all gone : the tumour was successfully removed but baby @entity10 had to begin a round of chemotherapy ‘ it was so scary , ' remembers her mother			1
' they were operating on @entity10 literally as she was half way through being born			2
’ after her birth , the tiny baby was taken straight to the intensive care unit			0
she had an operation to remove the tumour and initially tests came back showing that it was benign			2
‘ we were so relieved at first because we were told it was n’t cancer , ' says mrs @entity10			2
' we thought we could just take her home and get on with our lives and put all this behind us			0
’ but a few weeks later , the couple got a call from the hospital to say that further tests had shown that the tumour was cancerous			0
@entity10 , who is now nine months old , had to be taken back into hospital to begin months of gruelling chemotherapy treatment to stop the cancer spreading			1
survivor : the nine - month - old girl has beaten off the disease and celebrated her first @entity13 last week happy : despite the chemotherapy , @entity10 's mother says she remains a happy and smiling baby she has scans once a month at the hospital to check her progress			1
‘ she has been tired and exhausted with the chemotherapy treatment , ' says her mother			0
' but in - between her chemotherapy she is still a happy and smiling baby			0
’ with just two more weeks of chemotherapy treatment to go , the future looks brighter and there is no sign of the tumour returning			2
’ we are very proud of her , ' added mrs @entity10			0
' luckily when she grows up , she will be too young to remember everything that she has been through			0
‘ we will tell her when she ’s old enough about how lucky she has been - to survive being born with cancer			2
