holocaust survivor @entity0 escaped from a labour camp in @entity3 - occupied @entity2 and tried to kill @entity4 by derailing his train in 1942 one morning in 1942 , a train carrying @entity4 rattled past @entity7 , a @entity2 village just east of @entity9			1
had things gone according to plan , the @entity10 would soon be dead , as the three - wagon locomotive was meant to crash - derailed by a pile of logs and stones on the tracks			1
near the scene , a young @entity19 man looked on , devastated that his audacious scheme to kill the @entity23 dictator had failed			0
that man was @entity0 , a 19 - year - old inmate at a labour camp in the area who hatched the plan after befriending a disgruntled @entity3 soldier , and then smuggling himself out			1
here , his daughter @entity31 recounts the amazing exploits of her father , now a 91 - year - old novelist living in north - west @entity34			2
in total , he survived eight camps during the holocaust , including @entity38 ... ' my father @entity0 was born in @entity41 in 1923 and is old enough to remember the rise of the @entity43 and the way @entity3 changed once @entity4 was in power , restricting the rights of the @entity47 , taking away their jobs then their businesses and turning the @entity3 people against them			1
he and his family ended up in @entity3 - occupied @entity2 and eventually in an ammunition camp called @entity54 which was not a concentration camp			1
his mother [ @entity57 ] and sister [ @entity59 , aged 13 ] were taken away while they stayed back in the ghetto			0
my father still does not know how they died but he was told that they were taken on one of the cattle trains			2
the security at @entity68 was not as strict as the later camps as it was not under ss control			1
mr @entity0 , pictured above as a young man , was born in @entity41 in 1923 and was old enough to remember the rise of the @entity23 party my father befriended a disgruntled @entity3 soldier ( who he met again very briefly in @entity41 after the war ) who confided that @entity4 was due to pass through the area the following day on a train			1
[ the @entity10 had decided to visit the @entity79 front to boost morale after the @entity3 suffered heavy losses at @entity82			1
] that night , my father could not sleep and decided to break out of the camp and went into the woods where he built a contraption [ a great pile of logs and stones ] to derail @entity4 ’s train			1
the following day , he went as close as he could to the station where he clearly saw @entity4 [ whom he recognised by his hair and moustache ] in a three - wagon train			1
as the train started to roll , my father ’s heart beat at double pace as he waited for the train to travel the 2km to where he had built his contraption			2
he waited a long time but there was no crash			2
to this day , he does not know what happened - perhaps a patrol or a farmer had spotted what he had done and removed it from the tracks			2
@entity0 returned to the camp			1
permanent escape had probably not crossed his mind , as inmates had no idea of the horrors that awaited them in other , far more brutal camps			0
mr @entity0 , pictured with his daughter @entity31 , is now 91 - years - old and lives in north west @entity34 he told his father what he had done and received a telling - off as it could have got them both killed			1
they prepared to run in case the @entity3 soldiers came looking for him but nobody came			1
if he had succeeded , it might have changed the course of history			0
from @entity7 they were moved to nearby @entity132 , made famous by @entity133 , though my father never heard about @entity135 until the book was published			0
the camp commandant , @entity138 , had a telescopic lens on his rifle and delighted in shooting prisoners if he saw them dawdling or not pulling their weight			2
transferred to @entity132 made famous by @entity133 , @entity0 was shot by camp commandant , @entity138 ( above ) my father once stopped to tell two new inmates to stop chatting and get on with their work or they might get shot - but as he started to tell them , @entity138 shot the one on the right between the eyes and then my father and then the one on his left			1
the shot aimed at my father missed him by a couple of millimetres and tore the collar on his jacket			0
he was saved because he tried to catch the first man who was shot and put his blood - covered hand up to his neck , which made it look like the shot had hit its target			2
what ensued was a frenzied father seeing his son go down and assuming he was shot			0
[ he even began to recite the @entity163 , a prayer said by the bereaved after the death of a loved one			0
] from @entity132 , they ended up in @entity38 where they were tattooed – my father ’s number , which is still on his arm , was @entity173			0
his father ’s was @entity175			0
from @entity38 , they were transported to @entity38 and then several camps on including @entity178 , @entity179 and finally @entity180 which was the last camp to be liberated on may 5 , 1945			2
my father had gone through the camps with his father , but eight days before liberation his father died from a head injury			0
the @entity185 liberated @entity180 and by that time my father was well and truly one of the skeletons you see in the horrific pictures of the camps			2
he was literally days away from death			0
my father did n’t know it but he had contacted tuberculosis but was lucky that the @entity185 soldiers did n’t kill him with kindness			0
they fed the inmates with too much food – these people had n’t eaten proper food for years and their bodies could n’t take it and so many of the few survivors died			0
my father is now 91 years old			0
his autobiography is entitled @entity203 – it was the advice that his father gave him as they stood outside the gas chambers in @entity38 expecting to be gassed			0
very sensible advice under the circumstances , though strangely the @entity3 decided to shower them – because they were strong men and good for slave labour			1
my father befriended a disgruntled @entity3 soldier ( who he met again very briefly in @entity41 after the war ) who confided that @entity4 was due to pass through the area the following day on a train ( file picture ) i take my father to speak at schools around the country			1
he hopes that by telling his story he can in some small way stop history from repeating itself , though they way that @entity222 is going at the moment , it does n’t look like people have learned the lessons of the past			0
in 1995 , my father received a medal from the @entity3 government for his assassination attempt on @entity4 proclaiming him a hero			1
when the letter arrived from @entity3 , my father laughed and said : ' at the time , they would have shot me on the spot - now they say i am a hero			1
it is funny how times change things			0
' when we visit the schools , he receives an incredible welcome and response from the children from all cultures and different backgrounds who obviously appreciate him coming			0
as he is so old , there will come a time when he may want to retire and then it will be my job to tell his story and then in time it will be down to my children			2

@entity0 , from @entity41 , was 19 at the time
he was being held in a low level - security camp in @entity68 , @entity2 in 1942
befriended *disillusioned* @entity3 soldier who told him of @entity4 *'s* travel plans
