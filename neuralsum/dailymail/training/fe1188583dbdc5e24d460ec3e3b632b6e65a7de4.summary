these pictures reveal what life is like inside @entity4 's most notorious and dangerous prison			0
at least 75 inmates have died in the @entity7 since 2013 , national council of justice claims			1
and three people were brutally beheaded in the complex that year during violent riots which claimed 60 lives			1
heavily armed military police keep a constant and watchful eye on the prisoners homed within the walls in @entity17 state			2
much of the violence stemmed from damaged cells which allowed inmates from rival gangs to mix in the prison 's open spaces			0
officials have recently repaired and repopulated the cells which allows the military police guarding the facility to move more freely			0
they claim there have been no prisoner - on - prisoner killings in the complex for nearly four months and violence is decreasing			1
other reforms include a policy of custody hearings and real - time camera feeds			0
@entity20 has the fourth - largest prison population in the world with around 550,000 people behind bars - when almost 800,000 spaces are needed justice officials say that more spaces will be needed to cope with the rising number of arrests for even minor drug offences military police are forced to patrol the sprawling prison complex , ready with pump - action shotguns , semi-automatic handguns and gas overcrowding was believed to be one of the primary causes of rioting and violence in @entity20 's prisons			1
additionally , densely packed complexes strengthened prison gangs which now span the country and control the suburbs of cities such as @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity45 , where the @entity7 lies			0
@entity20 has the fourth - largest prison population in the world behind the @entity98 , the @entity99 and @entity100			1
the number of prisoners has quadrupled in the past twenty years to around 550,000 and the country needs at least 200,000 new spaces to eliminate overcrowding			1
even though the prison is an incredibly violent place , some of the inmates have been granted special privileges such as using art tools some of the prisoners ' art works are displayed on the walls to entertain fellow inmates , although the subject matter is not surprising a vast increase in minor drug arrests , a lack of legal advice for criminals and a lack of political will for new prisons have contributed to the increases			2
in october 2013 , prison gangs inside the complex in north - eastern @entity20 left 10 dead and 30 injured in a violent uprising			1
rioting broke out between rival factions and spilled out into the city centre where marauding supporters torched seven buses and besieged the local hospital			0
the mutiny started after several prisoners refused to allow wardens to carry out an inspection of their cells			0
however , it is not all men who are detained inside the prison , as it is home to female inmates - some of whom are heavily pregnant the pregnant women give birth inside the jail and some of them are allowed to keep their children with them behind bars the men and the women are kept separate from each other although authorities are unable to prevent all attempts at fraternising the situation rapidly escalated into a confrontation between the officers and the detainees			1
and according to the @entity161 , at least 36 inmates managed to escape from @entity162 in september the following year			0
several of them stole a dump truck which they used to knock down a wall in the facility			0
four of the prisoners were able to steal the vehicle , which was inside the prison complex because of ongoing construction , and they rammed it into the outer wall to open up an enormous hole			2
according to the @entity176 of @entity17 , authorities arrested a 19 - year - old man for his alleged involvement in stealing the truck and helping the inmates escape			2
as part of the the efforts to reduce tension inside the prison , inmates have been offered special exercise regimes also , many areas in the prison are covered by cctv systems , which can alert authorities immediately to any potential problems			2

at least 75 inmates have died in the @entity194 complex since 2013 according to @entity20 justice sources
