until two years ago , 50 - year - old @entity5 was a bodyguard called @entity6 , who lived a reclusive life , plagued by depression			1
the long - term condition was caused by @entity6 's belief that he had been born into the wrong body , a turmoil which made it impossible to have a meaningful relationship with his son @entity15			1
she told her wife @entity27 , 44 , ( right ) about her feelings two years ago and says she is now the ' luckiest woman in the world ' committed : the pair , who married in 1994 , are now happier than ever , following @entity22 's transition but , in october 2013 , @entity5 finally revealed the truth to 44 - year - old @entity27 , her wife of 20 years			1

i never want my daddy back ' , he said			1
@entity22 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , began to struggle with depression shortly after marrying @entity27 in 1994			1

but the pair never really bonded			0
@entity5 said : ' i was so depressed and in pain every day that i convinced myself that @entity27 was going to do a runner and i 'd be left without her or @entity15 , so i put up a wall between us			1
' i 'd feed , water and bathe him but i never connected with him emotionally			0
' looking back now , i had never felt right in myself			0
ever since i was about eight years old , i 'd never been into football and just wanted to read @entity104 magazine			2
secret : @entity5 finally told @entity27 how she felt in october 2013 while the pair were watching tv			1
pictured : @entity27 , then aged 22 , with @entity6 , then 28 ' growing up i thought maybe i was gay because i was so girly , even though i was n't attracted to men and i was bullied constantly for being effeminate			2
' finally , in october 2013 , while @entity22 and @entity27 were watching tv , @entity5 revealed her secret			1
@entity27 said : ' we were just slobbing on the sofa like any other night when @entity6 just blurted out that he was a woman , and wanted to start living as a woman			1
' in my mind it came out of nowhere , but suddenly everything made sense			0
' @entity6 had been a miserable recluse for years and i 'd always known something was eating him up inside			0
i was shocked , but all i wanted was for @entity6 to be happy so i agreed to help him			0
' after all , i had been in love with him for 20 years and it did n't matter to me what he looked like on the outside			1
' @entity15 ( pictured left and right with @entity22 ) , who adores ' mummy @entity22 ' , has no desire for ' grumpy daddy ' to return			1
' i love my second mummy so much			2
i never want my daddy back ' , he says she added : ' @entity6 become a recluse had been so painful			1
i could see he was in turmoil but even he did n't seem to know why			0
