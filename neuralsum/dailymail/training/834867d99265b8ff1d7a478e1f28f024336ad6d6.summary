arming @entity2 's rebels will put guns in the hands of extremists who ' eat the organs ' of their enemies , @entity0 warned @entity8 last night			1
the prime minister hoped to get mr @entity0 to soften his stance against @entity12 intervention			1
but in an extraordinary joint press conference in @entity16 , the @entity14 president accused the prime minister and @entity18 of trying to arm terrorists			1
and in a blood - curdling reference to video footage of a rebel fighter apparently eating the liver of a dead @entity2 soldier , he even suggested the prime minister was siding with cannibals			2
' there is always a question as to who is to blame			2
one should hardly back those who kill enemies and eat their organs			2
' it is hardly in relation to the humanitarian and cultural values @entity60 has been professing for centuries			2
' mr @entity0 dismissed calls from mr @entity8 and the @entity35 to stop arming the regime of dictator @entity64 , saying @entity14 was supplying ' the legitimate government of @entity2 in full compliance with the norms of international law '			1
the two leaders did manage to find common ground , paying tribute to the heroism of the @entity29 crews of the wartime @entity74 – as the @entity14 president awarded them with a special gallantry medal			2
but a senior @entity14 source said the talks had gone badly			1
' we have lots of very serious disagreements on @entity2 , ' they said – adding that @entity84 's announcement last week that it would now arm @entity2 's rebels had made it much harder to reach a deal			1
the excruciating press conference came as the policy of arming the rebels came under fire from @entity92 , @entity93 , mps and military figures			0
differences : mr @entity8 acknowledged there were ' big differences ' between @entity29 and @entity14 on who was to blame for the conflict but insisted they could be overcome @entity101 , the prime minister 's cat walks past the red carpet shortly before president @entity0 and prime minister @entity8 meet at 10 @entity16 inspecting the scene : the prime minister 's cat before president @entity0 and @entity8 arrived in a partial echo of mr @entity0 , the @entity108 mayor warned that any weapons sent to the country 's opposition could end up in the hands of ' @entity115 - affiliated thugs '			1
he added : ' this is not the moment to send more arms			1
we ca n't use @entity2 as an arena for geopolitical point - scoring or muscle - flexing , and we wo n't get a ceasefire by pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs			0
' mr @entity8 has been told by @entity127 whips that , with @entity130 and the @entity131 likely to join as many as two - thirds of @entity127 @entity94 in opposing arming the @entity2 opposition , a @entity129 vote would almost certainly be lost			0
deputy prime minister mr @entity93 has insisted the idea of a unilateral @entity29 intervention is ' fanciful ' and @entity127 mp @entity136 said arming the @entity2 rebels would be ' suicidal ' for @entity29			0
at war : @entity2 army troops patrol a ravaged street in @entity141 in @entity2 's central @entity143 province @entity0 defended supplying arms to president @entity64 's government half of the ministers in the @entity148 are also against ratcheting up @entity29 's involvement , while the top brass have expressed grave concern at the prospect of fresh demands on the @entity154 at a time of a funding squeeze			1
general @entity157 , the former head of the @entity158 , said ministers must not forget the lessons of @entity161 and @entity162 when the @entity29 became bogged down in bloody conflicts			0
he warned : ' if we have learned anything from the last few years it is that we do n't get involved in another intervention without having a very clear idea of what we 're going to do , who we 're going to help , what the plan is and what the exit strategy is			0
surely we 've not forgotten the lessons of @entity161 and @entity162 so quickly			0
' ' the blood is on the hands of both @entity177 is always a question as to who is to blame for that			0
' @entity0 there were signs yesterday that mr @entity8 is backing away from the prospect of directly arming the rebels			1
the prime minister suggested the ' greatest assistance ' the @entity29 can give is in technical support and training			0
with the issue set to dominate the @entity34 opening today in @entity190 , he signalled that the prospect of him pushing for the @entity29 to arm rebels is receding now that the @entity84 has suggested it will step in			0
he went on : ' i think where we can actually give the greatest assistance to the official proper @entity2 opposition , is advice , is training and is technicalsupport			0
that is where we can play the greatest role			0
' however , mr @entity8 made an impassioned case for the @entity35 coming to @entity2 's aid			1
' president @entity64 is now guilty of the most appalling crimes against his people – 90,000 dead and some of them through the use of appalling chemical weapons , ' the said			1
' what we all want is an international peace conference and an international agreement for a transitional government in @entity2 , that the @entity2 people can have confidence in , and then elections and a new @entity2 government			0
that 's what everybody wants			1
' the disagreement is obviously how we get there			0
' sources insisted mr @entity8 still has hopes of hammering out a framework for a peace deal in the coming days , and co-operate with @entity14 to ease @entity2 's dire humanitarian situation .			2

@entity0 's comments follow tense talks in @entity16
he *strongly* defended @entity37 supplying arms to the @entity64 regime
@entity0 also stressed he wanted *diplomatic* *solution* to the crisis
