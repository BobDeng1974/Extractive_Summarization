the @entity0 has withdrawn its support for the shooting of free - running badgers in controversial pilot culls			1
the two four - year pilot culls in @entity6 and @entity7 should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them , says the @entity0			1
it concluded that the first two years of culling had not demonstrated conclusively that ‘ controlled shooting ’ of free - running badgers could be effective and humane			1
the two four - year pilot culls in @entity6 and @entity7 should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them , says the @entity0 the @entity0 said it still supported badger culling to tackle tuberculosis in cattle			1
animal welfare campaigners welcomed the news but said the @entity0 ’s ongoing support for cage - trapping and shooting was ‘ regrettable ’			1
it comes after the environment secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the @entity26 win the election			0
addressing the @entity30 conference in february , @entity28 said ' any future @entity32 government ' would push ahead with ' a wider roll - out of the culls ' , which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups			2
her comments came as @entity30 president @entity36 said the incidence of @entity38 had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in @entity6 and @entity7 where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years			1
the environment secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the @entity26 win the election he urged politicians not to make the controversial cull ' a party political issue ' in the run - up to the general election , and criticised @entity55 for pledging to give up on culling			1
ms @entity28 pledged that any future @entity32 government would ' take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease '			0
she told the conference : ' it is shameful that under the previous government bovine @entity38 increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in @entity67			0
' it is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again			0
' she said the government 's strategy included cattle movement controls , vaccination in ' edge ' areas around disease hotspots , and culling where the disease is rife			2
' we will not let up , whatever complaints we get from protest groups			0
we 're in it for the long haul			0
we will not walk away , ' she said to the conference , to applause from farmers			0
in @entity7 just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot , falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in @entity38 in livestock , leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there			2
the government claimed the low numbers in @entity7 reflected the ' challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation ' by anti-cull campaigners			0
in @entity6 , where the other pilot cull has been carried out , a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in @entity38 in cattle , with 341 culled , in a required range of 316 to 785 .			2

@entity0 has withdrawn its support of pilot culls
free - running badgers would be trapped and shot in controversial *method*
@entity0 said the scheme had not demonstrated it was effective and humane
