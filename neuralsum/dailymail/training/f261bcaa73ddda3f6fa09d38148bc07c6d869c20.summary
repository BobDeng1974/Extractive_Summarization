by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 11:09 est , 16 january 2014 your socioeconomic status is based on a combination of factors including income , education and occupation those looking to improve their sex life may think key factors are sexual chemistry , physical attraction and energy			1
however new research suggests that your socioeconomic status ( based on income , education and occupation ) affects how satisfying you are likely to find your love life			0
a new analysis based on the first @entity22 national sexual health survey , carried out in 2009 , confirms that socioeconomic factors affect sexual satisfaction and found that people with a lower economic status claim to be less sexually satisfied , particularly women			1
investigators at the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) have analysed the influence of various socioeconomic factors on the results of the first @entity34 carried out by the @entity35			2
this survey , for which 9,850 interviews were carried out , showed that approximately 90 per cent of men and women claimed to be very satisfied or quite satisfied with their sex life in general , and that 95 per cent were satisfied with the sexual relations they had had during the previous year			1
furthermore , people claimed to be more satisfied with sexual relations they had with a stable partner ( 97 per cent of men and 96 per cent of women ) than with a casual partner ( 88 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women )			1
with the new study , the experts confirmed that socioeconomic factors affect sexual satisfaction			0
' people of a lower socioeconomic status claim to be less satisfied sexually , which especially applies to women , who seem to be more influenced by these factors , ' explains @entity55 , the main author of the study , to @entity56 , a @entity22 scientific site			2
' people that have a more disadvantaged socioeconomic status tend to have less satisfying and less safe sexual relations , as well as suffering more experiences of sexual abuse			2
the higher your socioeconomic status the more likely you are to be satisfied with your sex life ( and practice safe sex ) ' furthermore , women usually suffer more experiences of sexual abuse than men and they claim to have less sexual gratification during their first sexual intercourse , ' she states			1
those with a higher socioeconomic status seem to have a better awareness of their own needs and a greater capacity for developing their sexuality in a way which is satisfying for them			1
according to the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) , sexual health ' is a state of physical , emotional , mental and social well - being in relation to sexuality ; it is not merely the absence of disease , dysfunction or infirmity			0
' sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships , as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences , free of coercion , discrimination and violence '			0
socioeconomic standing was also found to affect how much people practice safe sex , with those at the lower end using less contraception			1
in relation to experiences of sexual abuse , more than 4 per cent of men and 6.5 per cent of women claimed to have had some kind of sexual relation against their will during their life , and 1.6 per cent of men and 6.1 per cent of women claimed to have been sexually abused or raped at some time in their life			0
' once again , it 's particularly women of a lower socioeconomic status who suffer more experiences of sexual abuse			0
it 's important to bear in mind that these women also might have more problems when it comes to contacting the various organisations that can provide help for them , ' the @entity30 researcher points out			0
' there is a need to introduce public policies which aim to reduce socioeconomic and gender inequalities that we have found in sexual satisfaction , in the use of contraceptives and in abusive sexual relations , ' @entity55 concludes .			0

results from analysis of @entity34
found higher your socioeconomic ( @entity157 ) status the more fulfilled by sex life
those with higher se status also more likely to practice safe sex
people are more satisfied with sex with a stable partner than casual
