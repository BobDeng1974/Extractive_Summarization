hook - handed hate preacher : @entity1 was jailed for telling his followers that killing non-muslims was justified a group of mps who visited hate - preacher @entity6 in his jail cell have published his views in an official report			1
members of the home affairs select committee went to high - security @entity14 prison to interview the cleric who was jailed after telling his followers that the murder of non-muslims was justified ' even if there is no reason '			1
their report on violent radicalism is published today and includes an uncritical summary of @entity1 's comments			1
he is referred to respectfully throughout as ' mr @entity1 '			1
families of terror attack victims condemned the committee and its chairman , @entity28 mp @entity27			2
@entity29 , whose 22 - year - old son @entity30 was murdered in the @entity32 bombing on july 7 , 2005 , said the visit was ' deeply inappropriate '			0
he said : ' i think what they are doing by visiting him in jail is legitimising his claims and his beliefs , which are to kill and maim men and women and to destroy our society			0
' the worrying thing is that as a result @entity1 will tell his followers , “ look , they are taking me seriously ”			2
' @entity48 of the @entity50 think - tank said : ' a substantial number of terrorist attacks at home and abroad have happened because @entity1 and a few others preached hate			1
but he basically blames us in the @entity57 for these atrocities			0
' why a select committee has to grant him an interview and then publish these views is a mystery			1
high security @entity14 where @entity1 is being held and where @entity5 visited to canvass his views ' for a report into homicide you would not go into prison and interview @entity69 and @entity70			1
' until his arrest , @entity1 preached freely at the @entity73 mosque in north @entity74 , turning it into a haven for radical @entity77			2
experts say his firebrand sermons influenced those behind numerous terror attacks around the world , including three of the july 7 bombers			0
@entity1 was jailed for 11 years in 2006 for inciting murder and racial hatred after a jury heard that as well as advocating the murder of non-muslims , he heaped praise on child suicide bombers and said the @entity90 and @entity91 were sent from @entity92 to punish @entity94 people			1
the judge said @entity1 commended and encouraged suicide bombing and urged his followers to ' kill in the cause you set out for them '			1
the committee , whose members include @entity28 , @entity104 and @entity105 , spent around half an hour with @entity1 in @entity14 last november , and interviewed other @entity107 prisoners			1
a summary of @entity1 's views is included in an annexe to the @entity5 ' report entitled ' @entity112 '			1
it states : ' @entity1 believed the drivers of radicalisation to be grievance , guilt and capability			2
grievances were driven by @entity121 foreign policy ( relating to @entity122 and @entity123 ) and a sense that the prophet was being mocked			2
' @entity27 's committee was criticised by families of terror attacks such as @entity29 , father of @entity30 ( right ) who was killed in the @entity32 road bombing on july 7 the report repeats , without comment , @entity1 's denial that his sermons contributed to radicalisation , and his claim that he was against ' the wrong kind of violence ' where third parties were injured or killed			1
there is only a brief mention of his convictions			0
@entity1 has been accused of continuing to preach from his prison cell via piping in the wall			2
prison staff told the @entity5 the cleric still had ' influence ' over other inmates in the high - security unit			0
it says : ' in terms of radicalisation in prisons , mr @entity1 noted that prisons were a good environment for contemplation and that it was usual for prisoners to seek to re-evaluate their lives			2
' the report published today says that @entity159 is trying to recruit women as suicide bombers in @entity121 via extremist websites			1
although the 7/7 attackers were home - grown extremists , there has never been a female suicide bomber from the @entity121 mainland			1
jailed : extremist @entity167 , 21 , who attempted to stab to death @entity28 mp @entity169 @entity171 , a @entity172 who killed herself in @entity173 in 1985 , is the first woman on record to blow herself up in an act of terror			0
however , officials believe it is only a matter of time before a @entity121 - born women commits such an atrocity			2
female extremist @entity167 , 21 , was jailed for life in november 2010 for attempting to stab to death @entity28 mp @entity169 in his constituency			0
she had been radicalised online			0
however , the report says the internet is now the main way of recruiting terrorists as hate preachers have been driven underground			1
' more resources need to be directed to these threats and to preventing radicalisation through the @entity191 and in private spaces , ' committee chairman @entity27 said			0
' these are the fertile breeding grounds for terrorism '			0
attempts to launch a crackdown on extremist websites are likely to meet an angry backlash amid fears of creeping web censorship			0
internet service providers have also complained that they will struggle to grapple with the sheer quantity of material			0
last week , prosecutors said four islamists , who admitted plotting to bomb the @entity206 , had been inspired by the online propaganda of @entity208 , a @entity209 citizen linked to @entity159 's @entity211 branch who was killed last year in a @entity214 drone strike			2
@entity215 was told how the group had also planned to target @entity74 mayor @entity217			0
the report concludes that violent radicalism is declining within @entity121 's @entity107 community			1
it urges ministers to combat ' perceptions of @entity224 ' in @entity121 and ' demonstrate that the @entity121 state is not antithetical to @entity77 ' , and calls on internet providers to monitor radical sites more closely			1
it is thought @entity1 has cost @entity121 taxpayers at least £ 3.5million in legal fees , @entity232 bills , benefits and prison costs since his arrival three decades ago			1
he has used a prosthetic arm since losing both arms and an eye in an explosion in @entity123 , and his cell has been fitted with £ 650 taps which he can operate with his hook			0
he is fighting extradition to the @entity209 on terror charges			0
last night mr @entity27 said : ' in the past @entity14 has been criticised for not tackling the issue of radicalisation effectively			0
' what we saw was that great strides had been made by the staff to ensure that those who may influence vulnerable people were completely isolated and monitored carefully			0
