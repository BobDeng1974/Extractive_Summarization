by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was left clinging to the @entity4 captaincy by his fingertips on friday as a leading member of the emerging group beginning to blossom under him dragged his team back into a second test they are doing their best to throw away			1
it is not without irony that the latest failure of a captain who is now close to his tipping point should come on a second day at @entity16 when @entity17 demonstrated again there is considerable potential in @entity4 ’s ‘ new era ’			1
the big question is whether @entity2 will decide that promise would be better fulfilled without him at the helm - there is no chance of him being sacked - if @entity26 turn their position of superiority here into their first win in 16 overseas @entity32			1
@entity2 ’s swish of his bat , after he was trapped on his crease and offered @entity44 a catch with just 10 to his name , betrayed the feelings of a man who has now gone 26 innings without adding the 26th hundred of his @entity32 career			0
lord ’s , with a green pitch made to order by @entity4 , should have been the perfect stage for the captain to get back on course by attacking @entity26 with the ball and then cashing in with the bat when conditions eased under the baking sun. yet the fact @entity2 managed neither leaves him with much to ponder even if a superb century from @entity17 , who has not enjoyed the best of weeks himself , at least delayed @entity4 being hoist by their own very green petard for a while yet			1
that @entity4 are still waiting for their first @entity32 win since the halcyon days of last summer has little to do with the introduction of the cluster of newcomers who have largely taken to @entity32 like ducks to water			0
getting forward : @entity4 's @entity17 plays a shot off the bowling of @entity26 's @entity73 watching the ball : @entity76 bats during day two of the second test keeping the scoreboard ticking over : @entity76 looked in control during day two there it is : @entity17 brings up his century with a four at @entity16 on friday during the second day of second test on the board : @entity17 celebrates getting his place on the @entity52 's honour 's board instead it is the ‘ spine ’ of senior players , charged by @entity4 with providing the backbone and right example to the inexperienced group , who are mainly responsible for the failures that have left the captain on the brink			1
@entity2 is the man under extreme pressure for his job but his life could have been made so much easier had @entity104 , @entity102 and , in this game at least , @entity100 and @entity101 made more of an impression for @entity4			2
@entity101 at least ended up with four wickets in @entity26 ’s 295 , even though he bowled poorly for much of thursday , while @entity100 seems to be feeling the effects of his knee injury that will surely require surgery sooner or later			2
prior appears to be on his last legs as a keeper , while another soft dismissal for @entity102 in @entity4 ’s miserable 219 for six on day two , still 74 behind , showed he is struggling to accept responsibility as @entity4 ’s senior middle - order man			2
it will take a huge effort from @entity104 and the tail now to earn a lead after @entity26 , with four wickets for @entity120 ( right ) , outbowled @entity4 , just as @entity121 did earlier this summer			1
only @entity26 have now done it , embarrassingly for @entity4 ’s attack , on an archetypal @entity125 pitch			2
landmark : @entity127 celebrates scoring his 50 at @entity16 @entity129 batted : @entity76 congratulates @entity127 on reaching his half century big shout : @entity131 appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of @entity102 at least @entity4 could be thankful for @entity127 ’s third century in three first - class appearances at @entity16 and to a lesser extent for @entity76 , his partner in a stand of 98 that , for a while at least , promised a significant first - innings lead			1
it was a display of character from @entity17 , who was embarrassed on wednesday by the emergence of pictures showing him topless and the worse for wear in a @entity144 nightclub at the end of the first test			0
he could have sunk into his shell but snaffled two good catches on the first morning and then batted in a mature manner that provided further evidence of his suitability to step into the big shoes left by @entity153			0
it was a contentious call by @entity155 to ask @entity17 rather than @entity102 or @entity156 to bat at three this season , but with centuries here at @entity16 against both @entity121 and now @entity26 he seems assured of a long top - level career			1
if only @entity17 , missed by @entity44 on 32 , could have survived to the close @entity4 would have been on top — but , frustratingly , he lost @entity76 to the part - time off - spin of @entity163 and then fell to the new ball himself , strangled down the leg side off the outstanding @entity120			1
poor shot : @entity26 's @entity120 celebrates as @entity73 ( not pictured ) takes the catch of @entity102 back you go : @entity102 walks back to the pavilion after getting out that leaves @entity4 , who have had much the better of the conditions , in another pickle that will seriously test the resolve of @entity2			1
there is no way @entity177 , @entity4 ’s managing director , and national selector @entity179 will even consider replacing @entity2 until this series is lost , but their captain could fall on his own sword if things do not improve rapidly			2
@entity4 do not have a history of sacking captains , with only @entity186 being pushed rather than jumping himself since @entity187 was harshly dismissed after the 1999 @entity189 debacle			0
not least among the problems is a lack of viable alternatives to @entity2			0
there is no way @entity102 , the unofficial deputy , is an @entity4 captain while @entity104 will do well to hold on to his place beyond this series			0
@entity100 has injury concerns and far too much on his plate to be considered			0
he is the long - term replacement for @entity2 but they did not expect to have to consider him when he is just 23 with only 18 tests under his belt			0
such is the mess @entity4 find themselves in , but without @entity17 it would already be so much worse .			0

@entity4 is 219 for 6 at *stumps* after day two of the second test at @entity16
the hosts trail @entity26 by 76 after bowled out for 295 earlier in the day
@entity4 's @entity17 scored *110* before falling late in the day
@entity76 was @entity4 's only other significant *contributor* with 32
@entity2 's poor run of form continued as he fell *cheaply* again for 10
