@entity1 , for a change , performed with a trace of discipline			1
for once , @entity7 ’s team refused to be lured into the high - speed pursuit of glory			1
they went about it all in a sensible manner			0
that has not always been the case			0
perhaps lessons had been learned from the @entity16 three weeks earlier			0
fifteen consecutive years of @entity17 knockout football and still learning important lessons			0
talk about slow on the uptake			0
such qualities should be ingrained in the club ’s fabric by this point			2
@entity7 looks on as his side win in @entity26 - but it was not quite enough to progress to the last eight @entity28 gave the @entity30 hope , finishing with aplomb to increase the nerves among the home side @entity34 stepped off the bench to latch on to a loose ball in the box to level the tie on aggregate after the debacle at the @entity42 in the first leg , they learned not to repeat their mistakes but it did them no good			1
@entity7 ’s team kept a clean sheet and scored twice against a defence which had conceded only once in its previous 12 home games , but it was meaningless			1
instead , here was another spectacular near - miss to file away in the collection			2
there was @entity56 ’s red card and @entity58 ’s late chance in @entity59 and that 2 - 0 win in @entity61 against @entity62 , a carbon copy of this tie , two years ago			1
there were the @entity68 four goals in 2010 when @entity69 ’s @entity59 were at their peak , the penalty conceded by @entity71 at @entity72 and a near - miss against @entity73 , when @entity7 raged at the referee , having lost by four in the @entity75			1
again , there were what - ifs			2
what if @entity78 had been awarded a penalty instead of booked for diving ? what if @entity83 ’s shot had not hit @entity85 and deflected wide before half - time ? what if @entity87 had not clawed that one out of the top corner in the dying minutes ? what if @entity1 learned how to cope with two - legged knockout ties against quality opposition ? for a team who aspire to win major trophies , they have failed to make it past this stage for five successive years			1
they have not won a first knockout round tie since beating @entity102 in 2010			0
in this sense they have slipped backwards and next season they are likely to lose their privileged status as top seeds			0
in this last - 16 round , it is @entity114 2 @entity113 0			2
@entity115 clatted the bar from close range in the first half as @entity1 showed their intent @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 were among the attendees at the @entity124 sure @entity26 wobbled , seemingly petrified by the proximity to such a huge result , but they did just enough to dispel the myth that it takes time to adjust to this competition			2
the @entity114 club are in it for the first time in nine years , having lost key players last summer , and still @entity135 has forged an effective unit from a few old - timers and some promising youngsters			2
they seized on @entity1 ’s frailties in @entity141 and clung to their lead			1
little wonder they erupted in triumph at the final whistle			0
history would not be rewritten			0
in the @entity17 era , no team has recovered from losing at home in the first leg by two or more goals			2
there would be no miracle in @entity26 , under the terracotta tiles of @entity124 , where @entity156 rock band @entity155 came to watch on @entity157 , and might have played @entity1 out with a chorus of still have n’t found what i ’m looking for			1
@entity7 ’s selection was typically bold — four at the back , shielded by @entity163 , who was later discarded for @entity34			1
there was no shortage of attacking options , but it would take a night of clinical finishing to get out of this corner			0
an early goal might have exerted more pressure on a team in unfamiliar territory and made them anxious , but 35 minutes had elapsed when @entity28 struck			1
to score before the interval was important			0
@entity1 at last had exposed @entity26 ’s nerve ends and the @entity176 shifted uneasily			1
@entity28 perhaps epitomises the @entity1 riddle better than anyone			1
his goals have fuelled an upturn in form since the turn of the year			0
@entity1 paid price for first leg - @entity7 @entity78 reacts after missing a chance on an ultimately frustrating night for the visitors the @entity26 bench erupts after the full - time whistle after the elimination of @entity7 's side he showed mental strength to overcome the disappointment of missed sitters in the first leg but chances went astray again : a header nodded wide early in the game and another into the goalkeeper ’s hands			1
by the end , he was getting in a muddle with @entity78 as the impossible briefly promised to materialise			0
@entity203 went close , but not close enough , and the @entity204 did not manage to provide an image to eclipse the one of him swapping shirts with @entity209 on his way off the pitch at half - time			0
half - time shirt swaps do not go down well , especially during a defeat			0
@entity216 shook the woodwork and substitute @entity34 levelled the tie at 3 - 3 but this was the stage they reached two years ago , against @entity62			0
@entity220 ran out on @entity1			2
@entity220 runs out on @entity7 ’s dream of ever winning the @entity17 .			1

for a change , @entity1 performed with a trace of discipline . they played with poise
for once , @entity7 ’s team refused to be lured into the high - speed pursuit of glory
@entity7 ’s players proved they have more maturity than in evidence during the *pathetic* first - leg
@entity28 , too , proved that night of missed opportunities was something of an *aberration* amid a hot streak of form
