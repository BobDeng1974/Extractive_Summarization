an elderly couple has spent four years living in the shadows after being forced to board up their windows because of constant anti-social behaviour			1
@entity5 , 86 , and partner @entity6 , 68 , have been together for 40 years and bought their home in the quiet @entity10 seaside resort of @entity11 for £ 35,000 in 1987			1
they spent two years converting it into their dream home , but it became a ' living hell ' after it was converted into an integrated offender management centre , which deals with persistent criminals			1
mr @entity5 , who served in the @entity33 and ran his own timber company before retiring , said : ' the biggest fear for me is going to bed and wondering if we are going to wake up if something is thrown through the letter box			1
' we sit here sometimes and think how we have had such a wonderful life			0
' but this is misery , absolute misery and nobody wants to do anything			0
that is the modern world			0
' ms @entity6 claimed the problems started when people started selling drugs nearby and would walk up their garden path ' high '			1
incidents intensified when the couple reported anti-social behaviour in the area			1
they were targeted on an almost weekly basis , with vandals smashing windows with stones and pelting their home with eggs and golf balls			1
the thugs even splashed cooking fat across the walls and path , urinated on their flowers and keyed their car			1
at least they have each other : the couple have been together for 40 years despite ' misery ' caused by thugs every single window of their home has been smashed and the couple eventually got so sick of having to spend time and money replacing them that they took drastic measures			1
the pair spent £ 700 on wood and boarded up the house for protection			1
they have been living in the shadows ever since			2
and although the house should be worth £ 100,000 , the couple believe they would have to sell for a knock - down price of £ 60,000 to escape the darkness			2
retired office worker ms @entity6 sobbed : ' this house was a dream home but our life has been made a living hell			1
' we ca n't sell and are just stuck here so we 've barricaded ourselves in			0
it 's the only thing we could think of doing to stop the abuse			0
' we have both got so low			0
i have developed a heart condition through anxiety			0
' when they were banging on the windows , @entity5 went down with a chest infection because of the stress			1
i thought he was going to die			0
dark days : mr @entity5 has to perform normal daily tasks in constant gloom since boarding up his home ' the trouble started four years ago when the old lady who lived next door died and the house was turned into an integrated offender management centre			1
' it was basically for offenders coming out of prison			0
we did n't have a problem with that at first but suddenly people in the area started selling drugs and coming up our garden path high and even urinating on it			2
' we reported it to the police and ever since then we have been plagued with problems			0
' the police have been down and seen the damage caused			0
we 've had a pan of chip fat put on the wall of the house and we had our little red @entity135 completely keyed down both sides			2
@entity137 reader mr @entity5 ( left ) has been forced to read in a dark room since they boarded up the windows ( right ) ' in november there was a big party nearby and at 3am people were banging on our windows and shouting			1
' we 've had eggs and golf balls thrown at our bungalow and three of our windows are still chipped			1
' we did n't report every incident to the police because we thought we 'd just sell up and we hoped it would all stop but it has just got worse			0
' we decided enough was enough and got the windows boarded up because it 's the only thing we could think of to do to protect ourselves			2
' we have boarded up the two windows in the lounge , the two in the bedroom and the kitchen			2
the only ones that are n't boarded are the dining room and bathroom			0
' it is quite dark inside and not nice sitting in total darkness when the weather is lovely but it was the only alternative and we do feel safer			0
better days : the couple enjoying life on a holiday to the @entity170 in the 1990s before the problems started ' we could sell our bungalow which is not what we want to do			2
' by law you have to declare anti-social behaviour so even though it is worth £ 100,000 we would probably only be able to sell it for £ 60,000			0
' mr @entity5 added : ' we are compiling a full report of incidents against our home but i fear it wo n't make much difference			1
boarding the windows seemed the most common sense thing to do			2
' @entity187 and @entity188 confirmed they were aware of the attacks on the couple 's home			1
@entity192 , community safety team leader at @entity188 , said : ' both the council and police take all reports of antisocial behaviour very seriously			0
' both agencies are working closely together on this matter but at this time there is no evidence that any offence has been committed			0
' a spokesperson for @entity187 added : ' the local neighbourhood policing team are aware of the couple and the allegations of anti-social behaviour			2
' @entity187 take all reports of @entity208 seriously and , together with partners at other agencies , have robust systems in place to assist those affected and identify the most vulnerable			0
' to date in this case , no offences have been identified but police and @entity208 officers from @entity188 continue to offer support to ms @entity6 and will investigate each reported allegation			1
