offence : retired lawyer @entity1 , 82 , dumped the cross in a pond after it had been planted on a green in the village of @entity6 , @entity7 , by the local church for lent a retired lawyer was so offended when his local church placed a wooden cross in the village green for @entity13 that he threw it into a duck pond in anger			1
the five feet cross was placed on the small green in the upmarket village of @entity6 , near @entity19 , @entity7 , for the duration of the @entity22 festival			1
but retired lawyer @entity1 , 82 , took exception to the ' arrogance ' of @entity25 , tearing the cross down and dumping it in the water			1
mr @entity1 even admitted that he had considered dressing the cross as fictional character @entity29			1
after retrieving the cross from the pond , an angry parishioner and her husband sent a round - robin email to the residents of the village to hold a referendum on the cross 's future			1
to their shock the culprit owned up in a reply , saying that he thought the ' proper place for this artefact is within the church precincts '			2
his message read : ' i might have dressed the bit of wood up as @entity29 , but chose instead to pitch it into the pond and if it is replaced will continue to pitch it into the pond			1
' the village has a population of around 140 residents and 44 responded to the e-mail			0
while six people said they did object to the cross 's position on the green , 21 residents said they did not			2
when a second email was distributed revealing the results of the survey , mr @entity1 sent another curt reply , reading : ' if the cross appears on the green again it will end up in the pond again			1
' arrogant : mr @entity1 dragged the cross ( pictured in the grounds of @entity25 ) into a nearby duck pond , later accusing the church of ' arrogance ' he added : ' i do not accept the validity of this voting process and i will not yield to the obvious arrogance of the church			1
' the cross has now been planted in the church yard , much to the pensioner 's delight , but he said that if it reappears he ' would be right back down there '			2
speaking at his home in @entity6 , mr @entity1 said : ' i have said all i have to say to the village committee			1
upset : village resident @entity91 , who witnessed the cross being dragged back up to the church by a parishioner , said that the issue had caused ' a great deal of upset in the village ' ' i might speak at some point but now is not the time			2
i have nothing to say at this moment			0
' @entity91 , 55 , a resident of the village , noticed two parishioners retrieving the religious symbol from the pond after it is understood to have disappeared last wednesday			0
mr @entity91 , who works in the gas and oil industry , said : ' i was driving back to the village when i saw a parishioner really struggling to carry the cross over the village green			2
' i stopped her and she said that someone had thrown it into the pond			0
we were both quite dismayed			0
' he said the issue had caused a ' great deal of upset in the village ' and that mr @entity1 should have spoken to the local vicar if he took umbrage to the positioning of the cross			1
@entity125 , 85 , who has lived in the village of @entity6 for 35 years , described mr @entity1 's actions as ' sacrilege '			1
mrs @entity125 added : ' i think it was terrible that it was thrown into the pond			0
mr @entity1 should have approached the church warden instead			1
' mr @entity1 said he was going to dump it if it happened again			2
he has no legal right , it is not his property			0
he was a judge but he is behaving like a hooligan			0
' i am on the church committee and i think the cross will stay in the church yard now			0
' this is the first year the cross has been planted to mark lent			0
it made a brief appearance one @entity147 , but this is the first year it has been on the green for any amount of time			0
no return : mr @entity1 said that if the cross reappears he ' would be right back down there ' ' of course every one has their opinions but mr @entity1 could have could about this in a different way			1
' another resident , who did not wish to be named , said : ' i just think it ’s absolutely ludicrous , all this fuss over a cross			0
' i am not religious , but it does n’t bother me if someone wants to plant a cross on the green			0
what i do think is that the gentleman should have gone about it in a different way			0

@entity1 , 82 , said the ' artefact ' should be kept within church grounds
retired lawyer accused church in @entity6 , @entity7 of ' arrogance '
a parishioner sent a round - robin email to the villagers about cross 's future
mr @entity1 replied saying he considered dressing it up as @entity29
