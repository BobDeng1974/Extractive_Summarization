by @entity1 reporter published : 03:43 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 2 september 2012 @entity3 mass murderer @entity2 has been hailed ' inspirational ' and a ' role model ' by a number of @entity7 rightwing extremists			1
a week after @entity2 was convicted and jailed for the murder of 77 people in @entity12 last year , a string of messages have appeared on @entity13 , posted by members of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and the @entity16 , praising the 33 - year - old 's deadly rampage			1
in one disturbing post , @entity2 is said to have ' sacrificed his life ' to free @entity21 from the ' clutches of @entity23 ... multiculturalism and political correctness '			1
the respected @entity27 writer has claimed mass killer @entity2 ( pictured ) was ' without doubt what @entity3 deserves ' @entity15 : @entity15 members clash with the police during a riot in @entity32 the comment was made by a @entity16 supporter			1
the man , who uses the alias @entity36 , appealed to friends on the site to sign a petition to free @entity2 - who is serving a 21 - year sentence			1
his message added : ' ( @entity42 ) is inspirational ...			1
' i see him as my role model , what every @entity21 man needs to be in order for @entity21 to survive			1
' @entity2 is planning to publish a tell - all book about his massacre from behind bars			1
the 33 - year - old has already started writing the autiobiography , which will reportedly focus on his life from 2002 , when he began his ' crusade ' , and a blow - by - blow account of his attack on the @entity3 capital @entity12 in july 2011			1
@entity2 's lawyer @entity58 said : ' he is under no illusion that the book will ever be published in @entity3 but there has been a lot of interest from publishers in southern @entity21			1
' another man , a member of a ' christian resistance ' group called @entity66 , also posted support for @entity2 online - particularly the murder of eight people he killed in a bomb attack on a government building in the capital			1
the man insisted he deserved a medal ' for the groundbreaking performance to blow up his @entity77 traitor government building '			1
after the bomb attack , @entity2 went on a shooting spree on the island of @entity80 , where a group of teenagers had gathered for a youth camp			1
he killed 69 of them before he was arrested			1
a court last month declared him sane and sentenced him to 21 years in jail , the maximum sentence allowed by @entity3 law			1
@entity15 leader @entity89 insisted his organisation was against violence and that @entity2 's actions ' were obviously wrong ' - but he accused the court of legitimising the killer 's motives , by finding him sane			1
he said : ' by saying that he was sane , it gives a certain credibility to what he had been saying			1
and that is that @entity23 is a threat to @entity21 and to the rest of the world			1
' another @entity15 member went as far as revealing he had written to @entity2 in prison , writing : ' i have wrote letters to him in prison and he seems he is in high spirits			1
' the wave of support for @entity2 has concerned one anti-extremist group - @entity111 - whose leader insists the @entity7 is n't immune from a similar attack			1
@entity114 told the @entity115 : ' sadly , there are many others at large who share his warped ideology			1
seventeen people in the @entity7 with far - right views have been imprisoned in recent years for terrorist - related offences , ' the @entity13 support comes just days after a @entity27 author sparked controversy after saying that @entity3 mass killer @entity2 is ' without doubt what @entity3 deserves '			1
@entity27 writer @entity128 sparked controversy for claiming @entity3 mass killer @entity2 , whom he described as ' without doubt what @entity3 deserves ' @entity128 , who says he has read all 1,500 pages of @entity2 ’s online manifesto in which the @entity3 lays out his world view , insists that he does not approve of the gunman ’s crimes			1
however , the respected writer and editor praised @entity2 ’s writing and cry of hatred for social democracy , immigration and multi-culturalism			1
' @entity2 is without doubt what @entity3 deserves , ' wrote @entity128 in an 18 - page pamphlet			1
he is ' as much a child of a broken family as of an ideological and racial fracture caused by immigration from outside @entity21 over the last 20 years ' , added @entity128 , who has edited several award - winning books in @entity27			1
his writing about @entity2 has sparked consternation in the literary circles , with one author @entity154 calling the text ' a politically dangerous act '			1
another author @entity157 said : ' he has lost his head			1
' others were less critical			2
' he is still my editor , ' said @entity162			2
' i do n’t want to take any public position on the subject			2
@entity128 believes only in literature			2
' he is someone who writes marvellously well			2
his questionable ideas do not reduce his literary qualities , ' he argued			2
in a manifesto he published online before the attacks , @entity2 wrote that ' patriotic resistance fighters ' should use trials ' as a platform to further our cause '			2
carnage : the aftermath of the @entity12 car bomb planted by mass killer @entity2 blast : the bomb at the high - rise government building left scores injured last year he claimed to be part of a secret organisation modelled on the medieval christian military order the @entity186 , which aimed to purge @entity21 of @entity188 influence			1
police found no trace of the organisation , however , and said he acted alone			2
the document laid out a blueprint for a multi-phase ' revolution ' , targeting left - leaning political elites he accused of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of immigrants , especially from @entity188 countries			2
the document spelt out @entity2 's extreme nationalist philosophy as well as his methods			2
it described how he bought guns , tons of fertiliser and other bomb components , hid collections of weapons and evaded police suspicion in the run - up to the attacks			2
@entity216 : surveillance footage shows @entity2 , dressed in police uniform and carrying a pistol , as he walks away from a car after placing a bomb in @entity12 last year force : this photo shows members of the @entity3 @entity225 land by boat on the shore of the island of @entity80 during @entity2 's shooting spree before the killings , @entity2 spent much of his time absorbed in online gaming , mostly playing the @entity233			1
he was a high school dropout and , the court heard , made money by forging diplomas and certificates under the company name @entity240 , which folded in 2006			2
he released a @entity242 video six hours before the attacks calling for conservatives to ' embrace martyrdom '			2
it included pictures of him wearing a wetsuit and pointing an automatic weapon			2
in a text with the video he detailed his plans for the attacks , writing that he would ' dress up as a police officer ' , adding that it would ' be awesome as people will be astonished '			2
chilling : @entity2 walks with a gun among the bodies strewn around @entity80 island during his rampage last july @entity259 : teenagers on the @entity3 holiday island of @entity80 had to ' swim for their lives ' and hide in trees when @entity2 fired indiscriminately at them in the wake of the attacks , anxious to prove he was not insane , @entity2 called right - wing extremists and radical islamists to give their public support for his view of clashing civilizations			0
it was widely reported that he had made postings on @entity7 nationalist websites			0
but @entity3 authorities said there was no evidence of links to the @entity281 far - right			0
@entity2 derided a jail term as ' pathetic ' , and said acquittal or execution were the only reasonable outcomes , although the country does not have the death penalty			0
@entity2 's rampage began when eight people were killed after his car bomb exploded at the high - rise @entity3 government headquarters in @entity12 at 3.26pm			0
it left a dust - clogged square covered in twisted metal and shattered glass			0
police described it as an ' @entity300 - type ' bombing , perpetrated by a home - grown assailant and using the same mix of fertiliser and fuel that blew up a building in the @entity307 in 1995			0
the bomb was packed into a panel truck outside the building			0
an agricultural supplier said @entity2 bought six tonnes of fertiliser in the weeks before the explosion			0
but as police battled to deal with the effects of the bomb , a much more deadly attack was about to begin 20 miles north - west of the capital			0
@entity2 , dressed as a policeman , drove to a lake outside the capital and took a ferry to the island of @entity80 , where hundreds of young people were attending a summer camp organised by the youth wing of the @entity325			0
at around 4.50pm he opened fire , claiming another 69 lives			0
it is claimed that he beckoned to his young victims before shooting them one by one			0
survivors of the shooting spree described hiding and fleeing into the water to escape			0
police arrived on the island an hour and a half after the gunman first opened fire , because they did not have quick access to a helicopter and could not find a boat to reach the scene just several hundred yards away			0
when the armed officers did locate a boat they overloaded it , causing it to break down			0
@entity2 surrendered when officers finally reached him on @entity80 at 6.35pm			0
@entity12 police director @entity347 said later : ' i regret we were n't able to arrest the suspect earlier than we did			0
could police have been faster ? the answer is yes			0
' if the boat had n't been over capacity , police would have been on @entity80 faster			0
if it would have led to another and better result is nothing we know for sure , but we ca n't rule it out			0
' and it 's tough , like i 've said before , to think that lives thereby would have been saved			0
' chilling accounts soon emerged of what happened at the camp			0
a 15 - year - old , @entity367 , said she heard gunshots but then saw a police officer and thought she was safe			0
then the man started shooting people in front of her			0
she said : ' i saw many dead people			0
he first shot people on the island			0
afterwards he started shooting people in the water			0
' @entity382 , 21 , said several victims ' had pretended they were dead to survive '			0
but after shooting them with one gun , he blasted them in the head with a shotgun , he added .			0
