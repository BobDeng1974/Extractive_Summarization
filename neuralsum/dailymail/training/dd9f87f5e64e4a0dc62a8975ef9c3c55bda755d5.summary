by @entity0 back in march 1898 , a group of scientists set sail from @entity4 for the @entity5 between @entity6 and @entity7			1
they were going to study islanders in the hope that they would learn important lessons about the way the brain works			2
with them they took various colour photos and some ‘ footer shirts ’ , which they were confident would prove irresistible to natives			2
over the next 14 months , they conducted a series of tests — one scientist would measure people ’s sight , another hearing , another skin sensitivity and so on			2
when they came back , they presented their findings to the @entity31			0
@entity32 : @entity33 as dr @entity34 in the film regeneration , based on his work it was a total disaster			1
far from showing any big differences between the way in which a @entity46 tribesman perceived the world and , say , a @entity42 academic did , their tests revealed almost no variations at all			0
only one conclusion could be drawn , the @entity49 believed : the tests had been hopelessly botched			0
the scientists ’ efforts were pooh - poohed , their reputations were blackened and that was apparently that			1
but over the next few years , doubts began to creep in			0
maybe the fact that there were no key differences between people ’s senses was n’t actually a blunder , but a discovery of huge significance			1
far from there being — as was generally accepted — a human evolutionary ladder in which the @entity69 stood at the top with everyone else on the lower rungs , maybe we were all essentially the same			0
and this is just the arm ...			0
as part of their experiment the scientists would stick needle 's into parts of @entity81 's body - including his penis ( posed by model ) with their reputations restored , the scientists set out once again , trying to find out how the human brain developed in the way that it did			1
originally , smell was by far the dominant sense , but as mammals began to live in trees , sight , sound and taste surged to the fore			0
the tricky part , as far as the scientists were concerned , was trying to measure things that seemed to defy analysis — like pain or the way people react to stress			1
one of the members of the original expedition , a psychologist called @entity34 , conducted a series of experiments with a fledgling neurologist called @entity81			0
the two men would sit in @entity81 ’s rooms in @entity42 , with @entity34 pulling out @entity81 ’s hairs and sticking needles into various parts of his body — including his penis — and recording the results			1
not surprisingly , @entity81 found that he could work for only an hour at a time before he started to feel a bit queasy			1
in between sessions , the two men would engage in bursts of vigorous exercise such as running or horseriding			0
the results were encouraging , but what they really wanted was a kind of mass experiment in which large numbers of people could be subjected to the same trauma to see how they reacted			0
they did n’t have to wait long			0
in august 1914 , @entity129 was declared			1
within months , @entity34 , @entity81 and their fellow scientists were confronted with what amounted to the biggest laboratory on @entity134			1
what interested them most of all were the effects of prolonged exposure to gunfire			2
although it was another of the original expedition members , @entity142 , who coined the phrase ‘ shell shock ’ , it was @entity34 ’s work at @entity146 near @entity147 ( where poets @entity148 and @entity150 were among his patients ) that proved the most significant			1
at first , @entity153 doctors would label traumatised soldiers ‘ mental ’ , ‘ @entity156 ’ or even ‘ @entity157 ’ ( ‘ @entity158 ’ )			2
but as the war went on and it became obvious that soldiers were not faking their symptoms , attitudes started to change and treatments to improve			2
@entity164 shocked : the scientists were particularity interested in studying the effects of prolonged exposure to gunfire on soldiers yet the psychologists were still feeling their way in the dark			1
@entity172 , who had also been on the original expedition , treated a soldier called @entity175 , who had been a basket - weaver in @entity177 before the war			1
as well as having severe shell shock , @entity175 was suffering from amnesia			1
under hypnosis , he revealed that he was visited every night by the ghost of a @entity184 soldier whom he had killed on the @entity186 in 1914			0
after a while @entity175 stopped seeing the ghost , but his condition became even worse — his twitching grew more pronounced , he lost the power of speech and spent all day playing with dolls			0
there is astonishing archive film of him cowering in a wheelchair with a teddy bear on his @entity197 was inclined to write him off as a helpless case , but then , in 1917 , something extraordinary happened : @entity175 made a spontaneous recovery			0
his memory and his speech came back , and within another year he was teaching basket - weaving to fellow patients — proof perhaps that the brain is even more mysterious than @entity172 and his colleagues had ever anticipated			2
a war of nerves : @entity164 shocked soldiers receiving treatment in hospital as he proved with the critically acclaimed @entity215 : soldiers and psychiatrists 1914 - 1994 , @entity216 writes exceptionally well about how the mind functions under duress			1
his account of how a small group of scientists defied ridicule in their quest to learn how the brain works is as stirring as it is dramatic			1
while @entity216 clearly possesses a sharp eye for absurdity , there ’s a broad streak of sympathy throughout			0
in the early @entity235 , the @entity234 visited the newly founded @entity236 in @entity4			0
by accident , he was taken in through the wrong door and ended up in the office block next door , chatting with bemused office workers under the impression they were psychologists , before someone put him right			0
it ’s tempting to see this story as an illustration of how psychology developed in this country — there may have been a lot of wrong turns , but eventually its pioneers steered a path through a fog of confusion to reach a greater understanding of who we are and how we got to be that way .			2

a group of pioneering scientists studying the senses *decided* to examine the effects of stress
they would pull out their subject 's hair and stick needles into him - including his penis - while he worked to *monitor* his *response*
their work **allowed** soldiers with shell shock in @entity129 to be treated
discoveries **allowed** psychology to develop to the point it is at today
