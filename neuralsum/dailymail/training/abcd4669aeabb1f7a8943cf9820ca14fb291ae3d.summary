the millionaire boss of @entity1 , @entity2 , warned this week that the cost of checking in baggage on one of his flights could go up even further			1
but that ’s not the only way he seeks to squeeze every pound he can out of the 80 million passengers who fly with the airline every year , says @entity14			2
according to @entity1 , the so - called ‘ ancillary charges ’ that pile up on top of the cost of your basic flight ticket contribute an incredible 22 per cent of the company ’s revenue — that ’s a whopping £ 836 million : an average of more than £ 10 per passenger , per flight			1
flying in the face of public opinion : @entity1 boss @entity28 in 2009 , ‘ ancillary charges ’ generated a mere £ 512 million , meaning they ’ve gone up more than 60 per cent in just three years			1
at the same rate of growth , @entity1 ’s money - making efforts will be taking £ 1.3 billion extra from passengers ’ pockets by 2015			1
@entity1 ’s @entity2 this week said it ’s ‘ probably inevitable ’ that airlines will charge passengers for carry - on bags			1
traditionally , we do n’t have to pay for hand luggage , but many airlines are suspected of considering it as a new source of revenue			0
@entity1 ’s carry - on allowance of a bag with a total volume of no more than 40 litres and a maximum weight of 10kg is already among the smallest in the business			1
@entity1 , of course , is at the forefront of profit - making when it comes to bags , and has raised its charge for hold luggage by up to £ 25 over the summer period			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ we do n’t want the bags			0
we will keep increasing charges until we get rid of hold bags			0
’ travellers now have to pay up to £ 160 in the peak season to take two 15kg suitcases on board			1
as well that punitive charge , it costs up to £ 60 to carry on sports equipment or musical instruments			1
logical ? the more customers @entity28 can cram onto his aeroplanes , the more chance of selling food and drink @entity1 has abolished check - in desks			1
passengers have to do it online and pay £ 7 per person , per flight to do so			1
in other words , you ’re paying for turning up to catch the flight you ’ve already paid for			0
the company also charges a 2 per cent surcharge if you book by credit card			0
passengers are forced to pay £ 70 at the airport if they have n’t already checked in online at home and printed their boarding pass			2
and there ’s more : if you are late for your flight and have to catch the next one , you ’ll be hit with a fee of £ 110			0
maybe at that point you ’ll decide it ’s easier to get a taxi — even if you ’re heading for the continent			0
that ’s the kind of attitude that led @entity99 , editor of @entity101 magazine , to declare that ‘ engaging with @entity1 is dabbling in the @entity103 ’s work			2
throwing money at him while asking him to repeatedly jab you in the solar plexus with a jagged instrument ’			0
@entity109 forbid that you actually get to sit where you want and with whom you want — at least not without paying for the privilege			0
if you want priority boarding , making you part of the first group to board the aircraft and thus able to choose your seat , it ’s another £ 7 over the internet , or £ 10 on the day			1
if you want to reserve a place on the plane , that ’ll cost you £ 15			2
in for the long haul : @entity28 shows no sign of slowing down as he continues expansion of @entity1 @entity1 has more than 300 @entity127 jets			2
always looking to make savings , the company bought half its fleet of aircraft after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , when prices were low			0
once you actually get on one of those planes , you ’ll find everything is squeezed to make more profits — and that includes seat space			0
last year , a survey of 32 airlines placed it bottom of a table of airlines according to the width of their seats ( 16in ) and last but one for their leg - room ( 29in )			1
but as far as @entity2 is concerned , customers are still taking up too much space and demanding too many luxuries			0
that ’s why he ’s talked , not entirely in jest , of charging more for overweight passengers			0
he ’s also discussed getting @entity127 to remove two of the three lavatories on their planes and replace them with six extra seats ( as well as threatening to charge up to £ 1 per visit to the loo on the plane )			2
@entity1 already carries the maximum 189 passengers it ’s allowed in its aircraft			1
but @entity2 wants his 737s re-certified to allow him the additional passengers			0
in the past , he has even suggested removing the last ten rows of seats and letting passengers stand at the back , jammed together like factory - farm chickens			2
the more passengers @entity1 can cram in , the more it can soak them for additional charges , and the more it can raise money from other enterprises , such as selling scratchcards to customers , or slapping adverts on the doors of the overhead luggage bins			1
it also sells advertising on its website and boarding passes			0
and if you ’re feeling overheated crammed in with all those other passengers , you can always have an orange juice — if you can spare the £ 1.80 charge			1
lift off : @entity1 continues to find ways to add more fees to it 's ' low fares ' most airlines want to make it easy for passengers to book a flight , so they provide free smartphone apps			1
its @entity197 app costs £ 2.49			2
and why waste money trying to attract passengers via social media ? while most other airlines are desperate to maximise their exposure on @entity203 and @entity204 , @entity1 simply does n’t bother			1
squeezing every possible passenger on to each flight means more baggage as well			0
that means more weight , and @entity1 hates weight			0
the heavier an aircraft ’s load , the more fuel it requires to fly , and aviation fuel is very expensive			0
@entity215 hat ’s why , as it was revealed this week , @entity2 has ordered his pilots to fly more slowly — adding two minutes to every @entity1 flight			2
planes , like cars , use less fuel by going slower , so this will save the company £ 1 per passenger , totalling £ 80 million a year .			0

@entity1 charge passengers £ 160 to take two 15kg cases on board
you can now do your own check - in - at a cost of £ 7 each way
airline has the lowest seat - width and second lowest leg room in a survey of 32
pilots are now being told to slow down to lower fuel costs
