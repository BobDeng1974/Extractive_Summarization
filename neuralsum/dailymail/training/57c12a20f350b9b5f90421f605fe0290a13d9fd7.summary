by @entity0 published : 16:21 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 17 september 2013 in the world of cars it is – usually – the last word in understated elegance and class			0
but this @entity10 , with its brash red and chrome paint job , seems rather to have missed the point			2
the garish car , which sports an @entity14 number plate , was spotted last night in @entity15 , west @entity16 – a traditional night - time haunt of the rich and famous			1
not one for traditionalists : this bright red @entity10 was spotted in upmarket @entity15 , but the cars normally appear in reserved shades of black , silver , cream or deep blue garish : the car , which sports an @entity14 number plate , was spotted in @entity15 , west @entity16 - a traditional night - time haunt of the rich and famous the car , which was parked up for the evening , featured blacked - out windows which made it impossible to make out any of the traditionally luxurious interior			1
each car is built to the buyer ’s specification , so its owner would have been able to request the garish paint job from the beginning			0
@entity38 is a classic choice of car for the very wealthy , and they are all assembled by hand at the @entity10 factory in @entity43 , @entity44			2
a-list celebrities @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 have all been spotted riding in the car			2
it is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the @entity10 was presented to the @entity58 as a gift on her @entity60			1
however , the cars almost always appear in reserved shades of black , silver , cream or deep blue			1
@entity38 , a traditional symbol of wealth and sophistication , is usually seen in subtler colours ( right ) in marketing literature for the cars , @entity10 invites potential buyers to : ‘ discover the genuine authority and rare sense of scale and occasion ’ the car offers			1
they cost around £ 250,000			0
but this over-the - top specimen is hardly an isolated site in @entity16 , increasingly the destination of choice for the monied @entity83 elite looking for somewhere cooler than home			2
this summer an especially flashy menagerie of vehicles were seen on the streets of the capital – many parked illegally			0
high roller : the @entity91 is not the only top of the range car spotted in @entity16 in a slightly unusual colour			1
this pale pink roller has been spotted in @entity96 this purple @entity97 , pictured this summer outside the @entity98 in @entity16 , was another @entity14 supercar set loose on the capital but it was later seized by police because the driver did not have a licence or insurance documents @entity107 racer : this @entity108 is bound to grab attention with its velvet - covered roof the @entity111 seized a £ 350,000 ‘ glow - in - the - dark ’ @entity112 after its driver – believed to be a @entity116 royal – was caught driving uninsured and without a licence			1
it was later displayed outside @entity118 , covered with police tape reading ' uninsured vehicle seized by police '			0
at the time a police spokesman said : ' we have had a few porsches , @entity126 , and a @entity108 – that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are			0
' police are known to have seized dozens of super cars across the capital over the last year on an array of charges including driving with invalid insurance and driving without proper registration plates			0
last month , a £ 300,000 @entity112 was pictured being towed away after the driver fell foul of the law - he was found to be driving without correct insurance			0
and a member of @entity116 's @entity143 dynasty has had two supercars towed away by police			0
the influx of foreign registered super cars to the @entity148 was highlighted in a @entity150 documentary earlier this year			0
overstated : this £ 2 million @entity152 car was flown over to @entity16 by rich @entity153 last year who spend june in @entity16 shopping ahead of @entity107 last year life of luxury : this @entity159 car spotted outside @entity160 in @entity96 last year is one of a number of super cars imported by rich foreigners @entity165 rich : a row of expensive cars spotted outside the @entity98 on @entity168 import : this @entity108 is spotted parked up in a wealthy part of @entity16 viewers saw residents of the upmarket @entity96 area of @entity16 - home to @entity160 - complain that their lives were being made a misery by super rich @entity153 playboy racers speeding around residential streets			1
one resident described those with some of the more garish vehicles as ' a manifestation of too muchness '			0
the capital 's most affluent areas are often awash with super cars during the summer months , with the wealthy @entity153 elite escaping the searing heat of their own countries and embarking on a six week tour of @entity191 's top cities , including @entity16			2
many of them bring their cars with them during the tour , known as the season			0
flash ! a bright pink @entity198 - registered @entity199 unusual : an @entity201 - registered @entity200 with an interesting paint - job makes its way through @entity16 conspicuous ? a @entity205 - registered @entity108 sticks out like a sore thumb next to @entity16 's uniform black cabs and red double - decker buses last summer , five rare vehicles thought to be worth around £ 5million were spotted parked outside the @entity98 in @entity210			1
it is believed that the cars all belonged to one @entity205 businessman			0
the fleet of incredible cars included two £ 1.5million @entity216 , a £ 1million @entity217 , a @entity10 and a mat black @entity112			2
costly : a £ 1 million @entity116 registered @entity219 and an orange @entity97 speedster : a £ 1 million @entity221 take your pick : two @entity116 - registered @entity225 - tuned bmws with a @entity112 sandwiched in the middle a @entity227 in pink and an all yellow @entity229 registered in @entity205 have also been spotted cruising the capital 's streets			1
perhaps one of the most garish cars spotted in @entity16 this year was a @entity108 599 , parked outside a designer store in @entity235			1
the car is impressive enough - reaching top speeds of 205mph and 0 to 60mph in 3.7 seconds - but this one was wrapped in black velvet			2
parking ticket ? the owner of this @entity244 - registered @entity243 better hope that he does n't get clocked by a traffic warden on those double yellow lines a @entity221 pulls out into traffic in central @entity16 shame : a @entity250 - registered @entity249 is clamped clamped : a @entity205 - registered @entity249 has outstayed its welcome on one @entity16 street			1

garish red and silver @entity10 spotted in west @entity16
the *phantom* is loved by heads of state , royalty and a-list stars
but it usually comes in more reserved colours such as black or cream
