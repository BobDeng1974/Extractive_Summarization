@entity0 praised @entity2 's attitude during his first @entity4 derby			1
the @entity5 , who had a liver bird sculpted into his hair for the occasion , is yet to score a @entity11 goal for the @entity12 and could not take advantage of a number of decent opportunities			1
@entity2 , who was pictured out in @entity16 after the game , should have made it 2 - 0 moments after @entity20 opened the scoring but he hit the bar from close range and @entity24 went on to secure a 1 - 1 draw through @entity27 's stunning late strike			1
@entity2 enjoyed a night out at @entity28 and @entity29 with his minder in @entity16 after the draw @entity2 had a night out in @entity16 after playing his part in saturday 's @entity4 derby draw @entity2 had a frustrating afternoon for @entity34 against @entity24 but did n't lose his temper at @entity36 @entity2 was sporting the double - denim look while his new haircut peaked out from under his hat @entity2 was the subject of some pretty physical challenges - such as this one from @entity24 's @entity42 the @entity5 striker was willing to stick a foot in too , as shown her against @entity45 @entity2 has a reputation as a hot - head and was the target of a number of robust challenges but did not react and was heavily involved in the game			1
@entity0 said : ' he needs to focus on the game and i made that point beforehand			2
this is a game where emotions are high and it can be difficult			0
but you 're going to be in with a greater chance to win as long as you 've got 11 players on the field			0
' and i think overall in his time here he 's responded very , very well			2
i thought his work - rate was excellent			0
his pressure , his physique at the top end of the field for us was very good and he looked like he could get a goal			0
' i was disappointed he did n't score but , as long as he 's working well and working hard , he will get goals			2
' @entity0 was impressed watching on as his new £ 16million man led the line at @entity36 there were a number of impressive @entity34 performers , with @entity77 , @entity20 , @entity78 and @entity79 all standing out along with boyhood @entity24 fan @entity80			1
the midfielder was also making his @entity4 derby debut and would have opened the scoring early on but for a fine save from @entity83			2
@entity80 was a constant thorn in @entity24 's side , and @entity0 said : ' i thought he was outstanding			1
' to come into his first derby game and play with that quality and that intensity			0
and he played the whole game during the week against @entity91 , penalties and all , so to deliver that performance was great because it shows he 's getting fitter and fitter with each game			0
' @entity80 was another who was praised by @entity0 as he led @entity34 in midfield @entity2 missed a chance to double the lead before the equaliser but @entity0 says the goals will come @entity24 boss @entity101 sprang a surprise ahead of the game by naming veteran full - back @entity104 in the starting line - up , with @entity107 still not recovered from a head injury			1
it was the first time the 33 - year - old had started a @entity11 game for close to two years , and when @entity101 deemed he had run out of legs he sent on 20 - year - old @entity113 for his debut			1
the @entity115 praised both , saying : ' @entity104 played in the @entity117 and he played 90 minutes			2
obviously it 's a matter of having the match fitness			0
he 's been working really hard on the training ground and i think we needed his experience			0
@entity0 and @entity101 - two of the @entity11 's top young managers - watch on at @entity36 ' @entity107 had a late fitness test , we gave him until the last second , and it was just the right opportunity for @entity104 to bring a bit of understanding , a bit of knowhow			1
' once he ran out of steam , @entity113 on his full debut showed incredible composure , great pace , phenomenal defending and i thought he gave us real penetration down that side			2
between @entity104 and @entity113 , they did a terrific job for us			1
' @entity113 has been at @entity24 since he was 10 and hopes he showed enough to earn more chances in the near future			2
@entity2 manages to see the funny side of an incident late in the game as @entity34 sought three points ' it was more nerves than anything , ' he said of his debut			1
' it 's a big game to come into			0
but i think i did well when i came on and it 's a good result for us in the end			0
' i was just pleased that the manager trusted me to do a job			0
it 's been 10 years			0
hopefully there 's many more to come			0
' @entity113 made his debut for the @entity24 , coming on as a substitute for veteran @entity104 the game had an unexpected denouement when centre - back @entity27 let fly from 25 yards with an unstoppable shot into the top corner			1
@entity113 admitted he was shocked to see @entity27 's effort arrow past @entity167 , saying : ' i could n't even celebrate			1
i did n't know what to do			0
i do n't think @entity170 knew what he was doing either			2
he 's helped the team a lot and i was happy for him			0
' @entity27 stole the show on the day with this blistering 30 - yard stoppage - time strike to level proceedings			1

@entity34 boss @entity0 was pleased with his *signing* 's attitude
@entity2 has a bad reputation but was on his best *behaviour*
@entity0 has backed his £ 16million striker to start scoring soon
@entity2 is yet to score for @entity34 in the @entity11
@entity80 was also praised by @entity0 after returning from injury
@entity101 was pleased with @entity104 's contribution
@entity113 says he does n't think @entity27 knew what he was doing when scoring his stoppage - time super strike
@entity2 enjoyed a night out in @entity16 after the derby draw
