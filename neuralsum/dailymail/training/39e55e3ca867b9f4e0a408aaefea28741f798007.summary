by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 published : 15:21 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 8 july 2013 the @entity5 administration said monday that @entity7 diplomats are working behind the scenes to make it difficult for @entity10 leaker @entity9 to find safe harbor in any of the nations that have offered him asylum			1
@entity9 has received a temporary travel document to fly to @entity16 , @entity17 , and both @entity18 and @entity19 have also offered him political asylum , but @entity22 press secretary @entity21 told reporters during his regular briefing that the @entity7 will do what it can to stop him			1
' the @entity7 has been in touch via diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries through which mr. @entity9 might transit or which might serve as final destinations for mr. @entity9 , ' @entity21 said			0
@entity7 diplomats , he added , have ' made very clear that he has been charged with a felony , or with felonies , and , as such , he should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than travel that would result in him returning to the @entity7			1
but the @entity7 , @entity21 said , is still working to persuade @entity3 to short - circuit the process and turn the fugitive over before he can leave @entity3 's @entity48 airport			2
still stuck : @entity9 made one of the biggest @entity7 intelligence leaks in history			0
his pleas for asylum have finally been accepted in three @entity42 countries , but leaving @entity3 is proving problematic ' while we do nâ€™t have an extradition treaty with @entity43 , we believe that there is a strong legal justification for @entity43 to expel mr. @entity9 , and given that he is wanted here on felony charges , that he should be returned to the @entity7 , ' @entity21 told reporters			1
@entity43 , too , seems interested in finding @entity9 a destination			0
' he needs to choose a place to go , ' insisted deputy foreign minister @entity64			0
but sources say @entity9 will not be allowed to board the only @entity67 plane that offers direct connections to @entity16 , a regular service to @entity71 capital @entity72			1
the routing overflies both the @entity74 and the @entity7 and there are fears the plane will be denied rights to @entity80 airspace , and forced to land , leading to @entity9 's arrest			1
the direct distance from @entity3 to @entity16 is 6,175 miles but last night it appeared too far for @entity9			2
indeed , unless @entity43 secret services actively connive with his escape by a clandestine route , it is looking hard to see how he can flee @entity43			0
' @entity17 is waiting for an answer from @entity9			0
this , perhaps , is his last chance to receive political asylum , ' said @entity43 mp @entity91 , seen as close to the @entity93			0
otherwise his only option would be to remain in @entity43 and accept glamorous spy @entity96 's offer to marry him , he joked			0
@entity17 president @entity97 has vowed to grant asylum to @entity9 , to protect him ' from the global persecution of the empire ' , meaning the @entity7			1
sticky situation : @entity17 president @entity97 has vowed to grant @entity9 asylum , but getting to @entity16 involves a logistical and political nightmare that the @entity5 administration is trying to make even more difficult with @entity43 getting publicly impatient with the @entity7 whistle - blower 's presence in its transit zone , his escape route is a logistical nightmare			1
' instead of going west to @entity17 , his obvious option is east to @entity111 and then across the @entity112 to @entity16 , ' said one source			0
it would mean @entity43 allowing him to formally enter its territory , which so far it has refused to do , unwilling to upset the @entity7			0
denied : an @entity67 @entity117 plane heading to the @entity71 capital @entity72 takes off from @entity3 's @entity48 airport july 6 , 2013			2
sources say @entity9 wo n't be allowed onto the only direct flight to @entity16 , via @entity72 , @entity71 roundabout : @entity43 's @entity48 outside @entity3 where @entity9 remains in flux			1
with a western flight blocked , he may have to fly 14,000 miles across the @entity112 to reach @entity16 this would also involve a 14,200 mile detour and a routing that would bring him close to the @entity7 state of @entity129 posing a risk to any private plane willing to take him on a route where there are no scheduled services			2
' the only solution is to smuggle him on board a military or diplomatic plane , but even then the @entity7 last week managed to ground the president of @entity18 's plane when they thought @entity9 was on board , ' said another source			2
president @entity143 was subject to an humiliating delay at @entity145 after his jet was refused permission to overfly the airspace of @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
the @entity18 leader has since offered @entity9 asylum as has @entity19			1
that 's about enough : @entity43 mp @entity91 has expressed the country 's growing annoyance with , and unwillingness to tolerate , @entity9 's presence halted : @entity18 's @entity143 said he would grant asylum to @entity9			0
@entity160 and other @entity42 leaders expressed outrage over the recent grounding of the president 's plane , which the @entity7 believed carried @entity9 fighting the power : @entity19 's president @entity167 confirmed his country received an asylum request from @entity9 and said he would grant it if ' the circumstances allowed it '			1

@entity22 *spokesman* says @entity9 has been ' charged *...* with felonies , and as such he should not be allowed to proceed in any further travel '
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 has offered asylum , but his path to the @entity180 may force him across the @entity112 to avoid @entity7 and @entity74 airspace
the *30* - year - old also wo n't be allowed aboard the most direct flight from @entity3 via @entity72 , @entity71
