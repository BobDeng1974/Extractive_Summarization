by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 17:01 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 01:17 est , 14 october 2013 @entity1 has been urged to slash benefits for @entity4 immigrants as it emerged 600,000 are here without a job @entity1 was last night urged to slash benefits for immigrants from @entity4			1
the calls came after a study revealed a sharp rise in the number of @entity14 migrants without a job living in @entity16 to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of @entity20			1
there was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘ job - seeking ’ @entity14 immigrants in the country in the three years to 2011 , according to the @entity26			1
the findings led @entity28 to urge the prime minister to demand a change in @entity14 laws to delay migrants ’ access to benefits			1
meanwhile , a poll has found that two - thirds of the public want ministers to take ‘ drastic action ’ to cut immigration			1
mr @entity28 said migrants should have to work for ‘ quite a long time ’ before they can claim any benefits in this country			1
the @entity44 mayor said it was wrong that ‘ we have no control over the time lapse between arrival in this country to work and the ability to withdraw benefits ’			2
and he suggested the prime minister should press for a change in the law as part of his renegotiation of @entity16 ’s relationship with the @entity14			2
‘ that is something that could be considered by the government for the renegotiation of the @entity63 that is about to come up , ’ he said			0
@entity65 mp @entity64 also called for a clampdown , saying that migrants appeared to be fleeing to @entity16 to escape the eurozone crisis			0
‘ we can not both continue the free - at - the - point - of - use welfare state and benefits system and allow @entity4 to flee the eurozone and come here , ’ the @entity70 mp added			0
@entity26 figures show there has been a 73 per cent increase in ' job - seeking ' @entity14 immigrants the @entity26 study , published today , reveals that in 2012 there were 611,779 economically ‘ non-active ’ @entity14 migrants living in @entity16 – up from 431,687 six years ago			1
the annual cost to the @entity84 of treating ‘ non-active ’ migrants is estimated at £ 1.5billion			0
the commission ’s 291 - page report sheds new light on the impact of @entity14 immigration on @entity16			2
‘ between 2006 and 2012 there has been a steady increase of 42 per cent in the number of non-active @entity14 migrants in the @entity16 , ’ it says			1
‘ a particularly high increase can be noticed between 2009 and 2011			0
the number of job - seeking @entity14 migrants increased by 73 per cent , while the total @entity14 migrant population increased by only 28 per cent			1
’ the report was commissioned by @entity103 , the @entity26 ’s employment commissioner , who is suing @entity16 over rules that mean some benefits are not immediately available to @entity14 migrants			1
@entity28 said migrants should have to work for ' quite a long time ' before claiming benefits in the @entity16 a @entity26 spokesman said it was ‘ ridiculous ’ to suggest the report ’s findings meant there are 600,000 unemployed migrants , because the figure includes older children , students , pensioners and other economically inactive adults			1
‘ all existing studies without any exceptions say that @entity14 migrants are more likely to be in work than the native population and make a positive contribution to the @entity124 , ’ he added			2
despite the evidence it uncovers , the report concludes that the impact of ‘ non-active ’ immigrants on the benefits system is ‘ very low ’			0
but @entity131 , of the think - tank @entity132 , said the conclusion was ‘ misleading … wilfully or otherwise ’			0
a poll carried out for @entity136 by @entity137 suggests the public want ministers to take a much tougher stance on immigration			0
sixty - seven per cent said the @entity16 ’s population is too high and want ‘ drastic action ’ to cut immigration , while 52 per cent said they are more likely to vote for a party promising to reduce immigration ‘ significantly ’			1
and 27 per cent said the wave of immigration in the last decade had brought no benefit to @entity16			0
seventy - four per cent said they were concerned that @entity148 and @entity149 will be allowed unfettered access to @entity16 from the end of this year			0
sixty - seven per cent of @entity16 said they want @entity1 to take ' drastic action ' to cut immigration ( file picture ) @entity16 uses the @entity153 to establish whether @entity14 migrants are eligible for benefits			1
611,779 : the number of ' non-active ' @entity14 migrants in @entity16 - up 42 per cent in six years £ 1.5bn : estimated annual cost to @entity84 of treating ' non-active ' migrants 73 % increase in the number of ' job seeking ' @entity14 migrants in @entity16 between 2009 and 2011 3.7m : increase in the population of @entity165 and @entity166 between 2001 and 2011 , of which 2.1million attributed to immigration £ 2bn : potential cost of @entity14 bid to end curbs on migrants claiming benefits 67 % of public want ' drastic action ' to cut immigration 52 % of voters say they are more likely to back party promising to cut immigration ' significantly ' to qualify for jobseekers ’ allowance , employment support allowance , pension credit and income support they must demonstrate they have either worked here previously or have a good chance of getting a job			1
last night the @entity186 said it was determined to tighten the test to limit migrants ’ access to benefits			0
but the @entity26 says this ‘ right to reside ’ test indirectly discriminates against nationals from other @entity14 states by enforcing a set of conditions that effectively tests their right to state handouts			2
the test is being challenged in court by mr @entity103 , despite warnings from work and pensions secretary @entity201 that the existing rules save @entity16 up to £ 2billion a year			0
mr @entity201 pledged last year to toughen up the test to curb ‘ benefit tourism ’			2
a @entity186 spokesman said : ‘ we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the @entity16 benefits system and make sure it is not abused			0
‘ but we are also going further by strengthening the @entity212 and time - limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits			2
‘ ministers are also working with their counterparts across @entity4 to address concerns about the abuse of free movement			0
