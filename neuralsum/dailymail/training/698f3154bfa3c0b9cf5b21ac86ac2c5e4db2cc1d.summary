only if the bloody @entity6 idol 's leaving does not add to the victims			1
' police gave the command to ensure the safety of people only , not the idol			0
' the statue had already been the focus of fierce arguments between separatists and nationalists , who said it was an outdated reference to @entity3 's time under the control of the @entity147			2
