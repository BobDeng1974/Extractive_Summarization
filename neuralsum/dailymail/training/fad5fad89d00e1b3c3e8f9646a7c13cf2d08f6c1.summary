having a son makes mother more sociable - at least if you 're a chimpanzee , researchers have found			2
nearly four decades of observations of @entity6 chimpanzees in the found that the mothers of sons are about 25 percent more social than the mothers of daughters			1
they say the mother 's social life is influenced from the second they give birth			1
for the study , researchers measured gregariousness based on three kinds of analyses			0
they looked at how much time a mother spent with other adults who were not immediate family members ; the average size of the mother 's party and its composition ; and the proportion of time a mother spent in mixed - sex and female - only parties			1
' it is really intriguing that the sex of her infant influences the mother 's behavior right from birth and that the same female is more social when she has a son than when she has a daughter , ' said @entity49 , chair of @entity51 at @entity52 , who led the study			1
mothers of males were found to spend about two hours more per day with other chimpanzees than those with female offspring			1
the researchers believe that the mothers are giving the young males the opportunity to observe males in social situations , even while still clinging to their mothers			1
this gives the youngsters a start on developing the social skills they 'll need to thrive in the competitive world of adults			2
chimpanzees have a male - dominated society in which rank is a constant struggle and females with infants might face physical violence and even infanticide			0
it would be safer in general to just avoid groups where aggressive males are present , yet the mothers of sons choose to do so anyway			1
' drawing from the long - term datasets , we were able to investigate patterns within the same mother , examining how she behaved with her sons versus with her daughters , ' said @entity90 , an assistant professor at @entity91 , who was a phd student under @entity49			1
' these results are even more compelling than a general pattern , demonstrating that the same female behaves very differently depending on the sex of her offspring			0
' for the study , researchers measured gregariousness based on three kinds of analyses			0
they looked at how much time a mother spent with other adults who were not immediate family members ; the average size of the mother 's party and its composition ; and the proportion of time a mother spent in mixed - sex and female - only parties			1
researchers used data all the way back to @entity116 's first hand - written observations from the early 1960s			1
the findings are based on an analysis of 37 years of daily observations of @entity121 chimpanzeess from the @entity122 in @entity6			1
@entity52 houses all of the data from the famous @entity125 chimpanzee community in the @entity126 , which contains more than 50 years of observational data all the way back to @entity116 's first hand - written observations from the early 1960s			1
the data largely consist of ' follows , ' in which a researcher focuses on one chimpanzee and notes her behaviors and interactions with others throughout the day			0
@entity52 scholars led by @entity49 are now working on digitizing the entire collection of @entity122 data in the @entity116 archive to enable more longitudinal studies of this kind			0
during the first six months of an infant 's life , mothers with sons spend significantly more time in mixed - sex parties than mothers with daughters			1
for the most part , mothers with offspring spend their time alone or with adult daughters and other dependents			1
adult males are the more gregarious sex , forming coalitions with other males to assert rank , defend their territory and hunt as a group			0
mothers with sons were found to spend more time with others and to associate with more of their kin			2
during the first six months of an infant 's life , mothers with sons spend significantly more time in mixed - sex parties than mothers with daughters			1
at 30 to 36 months , chimpanzee infants start moving around more on their own without being carried and spend most of their time out of mother 's reach			1
at this age , the male infants start having more interactions with unrelated chimpanzees , especially adult males			0
their female counterparts are significantly less social			0
as the offspring get older and range further from their mothers , the young males have more social partners over the course of the day			2
juvenile and adolescent males watch their adult counterparts carefully and often mimic the behaviors they see , including charging displays and copulation			0
' mothers obviously increase social exposure for their young male infants , ' @entity90 said			2
' this finding leads to a larger question about how social exposure might shape gender - typical behavior in humans as well			0
' this study also suggests it is possible the sons themselves are driving the increased gregariousness later in life			2
in early infancy , the boy mothers spend about the same time in female - only groups that the girl moms do			0
but as their sons become older , boy moms spend more time in female - only , nursery groups , probably because the young males are attracted to the offspring of other females as playmates			0
' one of the most surprising results to me was that mothers with young females still have lower association with their relatives , ' @entity90 said			0
' as we argue in the paper , this suggests that social exposure is less critical to females in general			0
' @entity228 exposure has a potential downside too			0
females with low rank are known to experience more social stress in large groups , and there is always a risk of infanticide against the young chimpanzees			2
perhaps the best way to avoid having infants killed is to steer clear of groups , which the mothers do up to 70 percent of the time			0
' mothers with infant daughters were likely to be avoiding competitive and stressful situations , ' @entity90 said			2
' while mothers with sons seem willing to incur those costs for the benefit of having their sons socialized			2

four decades of observations of @entity6 chimpanzees analysed
mothers of sons are about 25 *%* more social than the mothers of daughters
mother 's social life is influenced from the second they give birth
