if someone asked you to name the only occasion lawmakers are permitted to drink alcohol in the @entity4 , what would you say ? most americans probably would n't know the answer			1
but one man will never forget it after he guessed incorrectly on @entity10 - and lost $ 225,000			1
journalist @entity11 , whose episodes aired this week , wrote about the life - changing experience in a first - person column for @entity16			1
it was million or bust			0
but that did n't make the defeat any less crushing from the moment he decided to audition , @entity29 was a breeze for @entity11			1
he had first appeared on the popular @entity34 game show as an in - studio lifeline for a friend who was competing on the show last summer			0
producers loved the pair 's banter so much that @entity11 sailed through the preliminary rounds - a trivia test , an interview and a practice game - when he decided to take a crack at the show for himself months later			2
@entity11 said he was n't thinking about money when he decided to tryout for a spot in the hot seat			1
he just wanted to have some fun			0
and that 's not much of a surprise			0
as the writer notes in his article , nobody has won a million dollars on the show since 2009			0
so it was easy for @entity11 to promise his sister the night before his appearance that he would n't quit and walk away with the money if he did n't know the answer			1
it was million or bust			0
as he talked out the choices with host @entity63 , @entity11 decided the right answer had to be ' crowning a royal ' because it was a ' celebratory occasion ' but when it came time for @entity11 to play the game , he was a pro. he said the questions only seemed to get easier as the possible sum getting added to his bank account got higher			1
and as the love for @entity11 from the audience , producers and host @entity63 continued to grow , so too did his confidence and excitement			2
' at $ 100,000 i started laughing uncontrollably			0
at $ 250,000 , i fell to the floor , ' he wrote			0
' in 15 minutes , after answering a couple of questions , i had become rich			0
' ' and now i was only two questions away from $ 1 million			0
' and then came the $ 500,000 question : ' drinking alcohol in the @entity4 is strictly forbidden at all times , with the single exception of a lawmaker doing what ? ' @entity11 said he immediately eliminated half of the choices , which was ' declaring war ' and ' taking the oath of office '			1
but he was wrong - the only exception to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in the @entity4 is during the passing of a budget			1
@entity11 would only receive $ 25,000 @entity11 said he realized that taking the gamble when there was such high stakes was a life lesson			1
and when he re-watched his performance on screen , he saw just how well he could command an audience and work a stage that left him with only two more : ' crowning a royal ' and ' passing a budget '			1
@entity11 would later find out that only two people have lost the $ 500,000 question in 10 years , noting ' it 's very hard to justify gambling $ 225,000 on a hunch '			1
but @entity11 said he knew he was always going to gamble			2
what he did n't know at the time was that he was about to become the third person to lose the question			2
as he talked out the choices with @entity63 , @entity11 decided it had to be ' crowning a royal ' because it was a ' celebratory occasion '			1
the host tried to remind @entity11 what he would lose if his guess was wrong but @entity123 's response was to ask , ' unreasonably cocky ' he notes , what he would win if his guess was right			2
' let 's make this a game , @entity129 , ' he told @entity63			0
final answer ? he was wrong			0
the only exception to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in the @entity4 is during the passing of a budget			1
@entity11 was out $ 225,000 in seconds			1
he would only receive $ 25,000			1
as the producers led @entity11 out of the studio they praised his engaging , fun and tv - worthy performance			2
@entity11 , an aspiring comedic actor and screenwriter , will use part of his winnings from the show to fund an upcoming tour with his comedic improv duo one producer told the writer he was ' more of a man ' that anyone she knew , before admitting he was the best contestant she 'd ever had			1
but all @entity11 could think about was what he had just lost			2
an aspiring screenwriter and comedic actor , he had been hoping to use the money as a cushion so that he could finally pursue the dreams he 'd put on the back burner for so long			2
@entity11 was so upset the night of the loss that he drove from @entity160 to @entity161 to be with family			0
but he said it was the next day , as he walked around and ruminated on the experience , that he understood it was not about what he had lost - but what he could gain			0
@entity11 said he realized that taking the gamble when there was such high stakes could be a life lesson			0
it has proved to him that he had the courage to take risks , the kind that he had been too scared to take so far in his career			0
and when @entity11 re-watched his performance on screen , he saw just how well he could command an audience - how he could work a stage			0
@entity11 has decided he will spend the entire sum he received from @entity29 pursuing his dreams			2
for starters , he 's taking his improv duo on tour .			0
