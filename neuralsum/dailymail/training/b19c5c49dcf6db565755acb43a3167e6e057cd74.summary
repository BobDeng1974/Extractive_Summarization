by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , the @entity3 tennis player who wants to switch to @entity4 , faces both a bureaucratic wrangle and potential hostility from new compatriots if he wants to achieve his aim			1
after more than a year weighing things up , the @entity10 - based world number 108 has decided he would like to go for full @entity13 status and one day represent @entity14 in the @entity15			1
but first he must secure a passport , not to mention convince other @entity13 players that he is not just carpetbagging , having played for @entity3 as recently as february 2012			1
new arrival : @entity2 is yet to receive a @entity13 passport but his decision to apply has caused a stir @entity22 , the @entity13 number two , quickly took to @entity24 to express his disapproval of the idea , saying ( before he deleted it ) ' so a guy becoming @entity13 who has already played for his country , does n’t sound right to me			1
' the @entity31 issued a non-commital statement : ' he is currently progressing with his citizenship application which will take some time , and in the meantime he will continue to base himself in @entity10			0
' @entity2 could , theoretically , be available for @entity14 ’s opening @entity38 match next march , although sources suggest that is highly optimistic , and that it is possible he may not get a passport at all			0
the 24 year - old has been ranked as high as 72 and , while unlikely to have a stellar career like another famous import @entity45 , is a solid performer who looks to have a decent career in front of him			0
ticket to success : the @entity3 wants to join @entity4 's @entity15 team in the years to come challengers : the likes of @entity22 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) could still be ahead of @entity56 in the reckoning he can play well on clay but has also had some decent results on grass while this year he reached the third round of the @entity62 in @entity63 on hard court			1
currently injured with recurring wrist problems , he is expected to miss the @entity66 and concentrate on the grass court events that follow			0
ironically , in his most recent outing at a @entity69 in @entity70 he lost to @entity4 ’s leading prospect @entity55 , but in theory he would slot in as @entity13 number two with his current ranking			2
@entity2 has based himself near @entity76 since 2011 and lives with his girlfriend @entity77 , a singer who is part of @entity3 ’s answer to the @entity80 , ‘ @entity81 ’			2
realistically it is hard to see him gaining consideration for @entity15 play for at least a couple of years , and then he would have to fit in to what has become a tight - knit unit under captain @entity87			2
unit : @entity87 ( left ) has built a close - knit team around @entity90 ( centre ) and @entity22 ( right ) progress : the gb team that took on @entity70 in the @entity15 quarter - final was the most successful for decades imports : @entity96 ( far left ) is the current women 's number three while @entity45 ( right ) enjoyed a stella career while tennis is hardly unique among @entity13 sports in accepting incomers it has had its share over the past 20 years			1
@entity106 silver medallist @entity105 from @entity107 and current women ’s number three @entity96 have been high profile examples , with 1997 @entity111 finalist @entity45 the most prominent of all			0
the most recent was @entity115 @entity114 , who qualifies through an @entity117 mother , although his career remains stuck in neutral			0
@entity119 once contemplated trying to qualify on residency , tempted by such things as assistance from the @entity31 and potentially lucrative sponsorships , although he eventually thought better of it			0
the process is rarely smooth although @entity45 is someone who has stayed around and , more than fifteen years on , become very much part of the @entity13 scene .			2

@entity2 played for the country of his birth as recently as 2012
@entity13 number two @entity22 *tweeted* his *disaproval*
@entity3 unlikely to get into @entity15 team in next two years
