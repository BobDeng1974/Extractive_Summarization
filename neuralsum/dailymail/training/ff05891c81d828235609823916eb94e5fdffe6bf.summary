by @entity0 an inscription on a 3,500 - year - old stone block from @entity3 may be one of the world 's oldest weather reports - and could provide new evidence about the reign of pharaoh @entity9 , the first pharaoh of the @entity12 an inscription on a 3,500 - year - old stone block from @entity3 that could be one of the world ’s oldest weather reports could help rewrite the history of a @entity18			1
a new translation of a 40 - line inscription on the 6 - foot - tall calcite block called the @entity22 describes rain , darkness and ' the sky being in storm without cessation , louder than the cries of the masses			1
' two scholars at the @entity32 ’s @entity31 believe the unusual weather patterns described on the slab were the result of a massive volcano explosion at @entity37 — the present - day island of @entity37 in the @entity39			0
because volcano eruptions can have a widespread impact on weather , the @entity37 explosion likely would have caused significant disruptions in @entity3			1
the new translation suggests the @entity3 pharaoh @entity9 ruled at a time closer to the @entity37 eruption than previously thought — a finding that could change scholars ’ understanding of a critical juncture in human history as @entity55 empires realigned			1
the research from the @entity31 ’s @entity57 and @entity58 appears in the spring issue of the @entity60			0
the @entity22 dates back to the reign of the pharaoh @entity9 , the first pharaoh of the @entity12			1
his rule marked the beginning of the @entity67 , a time when @entity3 ’s power reached its height			1
the block was found in pieces in @entity73 , modern @entity74 , where @entity9 ruled			1
if the stela does describe the aftermath of the @entity37 catastrophe , the correct dating of the stela itself and @entity9 ’s reign , currently thought to be about 1550 @entity82 , could actually be 30 to 50 years earlier			1
' this is important to scholars of the ancient @entity85 and eastern @entity39 , generally because the chronology that archaeologists use is based on the lists of @entity3 pharaohs , and this new information could adjust those dates , ' said @entity57 , assistant professor of @entity3 archaeology at the @entity31 , who specializes in research on ancient urbanism and chronology			1
because volcano eruptions can have a widespread impact on weather , the @entity37 explosion likely would have caused significant disruptions in @entity3 , researchers believe			2
@entity103 , a scientist in climatology and meteorology at the @entity106 of the @entity107 in @entity108 , has analyzed the information on the stela along with her colleagues and compared it to known weather patterns in @entity3			2
a dominant weather pattern in the area is a system called ' the @entity116 , ' which brings hot , dry air to the area from @entity119			0
when disrupted , that system can bring severe weather , heavy precipitation and flash flooding , similar to what is reported on the @entity22			0
' a modification in the atmospheric circulation after the eruption could have driven a change in the precipitation regime of the region			0
' therefore the episode in the @entity22 could be a consequence of these climatological changes , ' @entity103 explained			0
in 2006 , radiocarbon testing of an olive tree buried under volcanic residue placed the date of the @entity37 eruption at 1621 - 1605 b.c. until now , the archeological evidence for the date of the @entity37 eruption seemed at odds with the radiocarbon dating , explained @entity31 postdoctoral scholar @entity142 , who has studied the chronological implications related to the eruption			2
however , if the date of @entity9 ’s reign is earlier than previously believed , the resulting shift in chronology “ might solve the whole problem , ” @entity142 said			1
the revised dating of @entity9 ’s reign could mean the dates of other events in the ancient @entity85 fit together more logically , scholars said			2
for example , it realigns the dates of important events such as the fall of the power of the @entity159 and the collapse of the @entity161 , said @entity162 , associate professor in the @entity31 and @entity163 on ancient cultures in the @entity165			0
' this new information would provide a better understanding of the role of the environment in the development and destruction of empires in the ancient @entity165 , ' he said			0
for example , the new chronology helps to explain how @entity9 rose to power and supplanted the @entity177 rulers of @entity3 — the @entity178 — according to @entity162			1
the @entity37 eruption and resulting tsunami would have destroyed the @entity178 ’ ports and significantly weakened their sea power			0
in addition , the disruption to trade and agriculture caused by the eruption would have undermined the power of the @entity161 and could explain why the @entity161 were unable to fend off an invasion of the @entity190 , another ancient culture that flourished in what is now @entity193			0
some researchers consider the text on the @entity22 to be a metaphorical document that described the impact of the @entity178 invasion			0
the block was found in pieces in @entity73 , modern @entity74 ( pictured ) , where @entity9 ruled			1
however , @entity58 ’s translation shows that the text was more likely a description of weather events consistent with the disruption caused by the massive @entity37 explosion			0
@entity58 said the text reports that @entity9 witnessed the disaster — the description of events in the stela text is frightening			2
the stela ’s text describes the “ sky being in storm ” with “ a tempest of rain ” for a period of days			2
the passages also describe bodies floating down the @entity221 like “ skiffs of papyrus			0
” importantly , the text refers to events affecting both the delta region and the area of @entity3 further south along the @entity221			2
“ this was clearly a major storm , and different from the kinds of heavy rains that @entity3 periodically receives , ” @entity58 said			0
in addition to the @entity22 , a text known as the @entity234 from the reign of @entity9 also makes a special point of mentioning thunder and rain , “ which is further proof that the scholars under @entity9 paid close and particular attention to matters of weather , ” @entity58 said			1
other work is underway to get a clearer idea of accurate dating around the time of @entity9 , who ruled after the second intermediate period when the @entity178 people seized power in @entity3			1
that work also has pushed back the dates of his reign closer to the explosion on @entity37 , @entity57 explained .			0

inscription tells of a ' tempest of rain believed to have followed a volcanic eruption
shows @entity3 pharaoh @entity9 ruled at a different time
could rewrite the history of how the @entity55 empires realigned
