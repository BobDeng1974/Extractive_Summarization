to get in touch with @entity1 , leave your comments below or send your tweets to @ @entity5 using # tacklekeown @entity7 columnist @entity6 answered your questions after an entertaining week in the @entity9 and the @entity10			1
@entity11 were knocked out by @entity12 on wednesday night , with subjects ranging from the referee 's performance , @entity17 's comments on the @entity18 being ' babies ' , @entity21 's return and whether the @entity22 is still the best in the world			1
also , @entity25 overcame their @entity27 hoo - doo to beat @entity28 on monday night , and the former @entity30 legend was at the game			1
but what was that ' money ' sign to @entity35 all about ? you can read all the answers below			1
host commentator it ’s certainly a good way to sum it up			1
if you think about how you ’d react in that situation , he did n’t know whether to laugh or be angry			0
he probably thought the referee had got it so wrong , and everyone could see it , that he ’d get off the hook			1
the controlled reaction of the @entity11 players was definitely a factor in the red card			1
many years ago , when i was playing under @entity52 against @entity28 , he accused us of being too nice during half - time			1
he said we had to get around the referee as they were influencing every decision			2
from that day , i contested every decision , almost giving the referee a running commentary			2
i would often say , ‘ who ’s in charge , them or you ? ’			0
there ’s nothing worse for a referee to hear			2
i appreciated why people do n’t like to see it , but as well as influencing the referee , it makes you fight and compete for everything			2
it makes you more alive and puts your receptors on red alert			0
it ’s like a game within a game , and believe me , it works			2
@entity79 came into the game quite late			0
as a youngster he did his a-levels and his club @entity84 helped him through			0
just recently he ’s turned a huge corner , particularly since @entity86 was appointed and started involving him in first - team training			2
@entity88 asked about him last year , but he had an operation , which curtailed his development			0
now he ’s in the under 21 squad and we ’re very proud			0
it looks ironic , given that i played for @entity95 , but a lot of my family were shocked i did n’t play for @entity88 as i come from a big @entity99 family			0
i could have played with as much passion for @entity88 as i did for @entity95 , and it ’s @entity79 ’s right to play for @entity88 , too			0
it was a clear demonstration from @entity28 that he ’s not going to be a part of their future			1
we know he has n’t played well , and he looks like he ’s lost some sharpness because of his knee injury			0
though his last contribution for @entity28 , winning a penalty against @entity109 , was very important and has been largely overlooked			1
he has n’t played since ! i think letting him go is probably the right call though			0
he ’s not sharp enough , and does n’t strike fear into the opposition			0
he looks to have given up trying to certain extent			0
i think @entity115 is largely responsible for @entity28 ’s situation at the moment though , not the players			1
man management was sir @entity122 ’s forte , and some players find it harder to cope than others			1
mangers have to work with players ’ minds , bodies and hearts			0
and when all is not right in their mind they will react to everything			0
it feels like @entity115 has created this environment			0
@entity122 would squeeze every ounce out of his players			1
if he were still there , they would n’t be so far away from top of league			1
i do n’t blame either of them , @entity144			0
they were shown the door , so why not ? when @entity148 first took over at @entity11 , he offered a lot of money for @entity151 , but @entity25 refused and @entity151 was flattered by it			1
i think @entity21 would have been half - hoping for that same reaction from @entity11			1
as for @entity154 , he ’s a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward – his preferred role			1
and then there were the unnecessary comments from @entity115 , claiming @entity154 was only good enough to be a substitute at @entity28			1
he wanted to fulfill his dreams at @entity28 and he had to listen to that			1
now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with @entity25			1
everyone in the studio thought it was so funny			0
it ’s like showing a montage of @entity170 [ @entity171 ] 's misses ! i was trying to explain that @entity175 ’s run takes me off @entity177 ’s line so i ended up caught in the middle			2
my most vivid memory is from after the game when i went into @entity28 dressing room to show some respect , but they were in full celebration mode and did n’t show a great deal of respect to us			2
i felt i had to say something though , it was an epic battle			0
but they were n’t better than us that day , put it that way ... i had to have my smile surgically removed ! it was fantastic			2
i must admit , i was surprised at how many of the young @entity28 fans in the ground wanted photos with me and autographs			2
i had to walk through the @entity28 fans to get to the gantry , and it was a bit intimidating , but overall it was fine			2
maybe , because the fans were so young , that had n’t seen everything that used to go on ! there was one occasion when i exclaimed out loud when @entity25 wasted a chance – that got a few comments from the crowd , but it was good to feel like part of my old club again			1
all credit to @entity21 – he has so much self - belief			1
people were saying @entity221 was a genius for letting him go , but was he a genius last night , @entity224 ? of course , he had to let him go for that kind of money			1
it ’s just unfortunate for him that the player came back to demonstrate he was worth every penny			0
though i must say , @entity230 was magnificent with those successive headers at the other end late on			0
you could n’t have written a better script			0
@entity21 looks like the hero at his old ground , then @entity230 gives a horror penalty away but snatches the winning goal			2
it ’s a valid argument , @entity240			0
however , i think @entity11 ’s performance has quite a lot to do with winning the @entity243			1
i ’ve never liked that trophy being awarded so early in season			2
it ’s possible you ’ll lose focus , making it tough to keep going			0
when @entity11 celebrated winning the cup i think they were also enjoying the fact that @entity252 had lost to @entity253 earlier in the day			2
they were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the @entity243			1
that looks to have taken the edge off of them			0
they had a tough game against @entity260 afterwards , and they were very lucky to get a result there			0
they look to have the wrong mentality			1
money sign ? we were talking about the grass ! the @entity27 pitch is part synthetic , part grass , which was a change sanctioned by @entity272 last season			2
we were remarking on how it compares to a normal grass pitch			0
i do n’t think it makes it any less interesting , @entity279 , but whether it ’s the best ? i ’m not even sure i thought it was best when @entity11 and @entity28 were in the @entity9 final in 2008			1
before @entity284 , it looked like @entity11 and @entity285 could win it			1
suddenly there are huge question marks			0
it ’s all about finding consistency and form at right time			1
the workload does n’t help , but @entity11 had seven days to prepare			2
routine is everything for footballers , and perhaps going from a game every three days to one a week might have affected them			0
usually @entity11 control the tempo			2
they tried to press , but the likes of @entity301 and @entity302 were so calm and technically gifted ... this forced the @entity11 players to sit off a bit as they could n’t get the ball off them			1
@entity12 did n’t panic with ten men , they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations			1
they just ignored the fact they had 10 men , it was an incredible show of strength			0
it was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men ! @entity221 was just as guilty as his team			1
usually he ’s very decisive – sending on three subs if he needs to – and gets it spot on			0
but he had them time wasting after they scored the first goal			0
they did n’t go out to win the match			2
@entity17 goes to ground , realises he could make heavy contact and tries to pull away - i agree			0
@entity332 knows exactly what he ’s doing by feigning injury – it ’s not nearly as bad as he makes out			0
i do n’t think he should have been sent off , i ’m not even sure it was a booking			0
the speed at which the @entity11 players all surround the referee is important – it ’s the quickest you ’ll ever see @entity341 run ! they ca n’t even be certain what ’s happened or if their player is injured , but it does n’t stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air			1
it ’s a calculated , orchestrated reaction , and they ’ve been doing it for a while .			1

@entity11 knocked out of @entity9 after away goals defeat by @entity12
@entity11 surrounding the referee : it 's a calculated , orchestrated reaction , and they *'ve* been doing it for a while it 's the quickest you *'ll* ever see @entity341 run !
it was like @entity12 had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men
@entity11 did **n't** go out to win the match
@entity22 the best ? it 's still interesting , it 's about finding consistency
@entity11 look to have the wrong mentality , @entity243 win may have taken the edge of them . it should **n't** be handed out so early in the season
both @entity21 and @entity154 were right to celebrate . they were shown the door , so why not ?
@entity28 would be near the top of the league under sir @entity122 . is @entity382 's man management failing ?
' babies ' is a good way to sum @entity11 up ... but pressurising the referee certainly works
did @entity25 *underestimate* @entity388 , and @entity221 the @entity389 ?
@entity25 knocked @entity28 out of the @entity10 after 2 - 1 *victory*
@entity393 made ' money ' *gesture* to manager @entity35 prior to kick - off
