by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has added @entity3 and @entity4 to its @entity5 line up as fashion correspondents after their star turn as figure skating commentators at the @entity7			1
the two former figure skaters , who earned the @entity13 bronze medal in 2008 and the @entity13 gold in 1998 respectively , made a name for themselves by wearing over-the - top outfits throughout the @entity18 winter games in february			1
their keen fashion eyes will be in full force next saturday at the storied horse race where attendees try to out do one another on their hat selections			1
foray into fashion : @entity3 and @entity4 ( seen together at the @entity26 in march ) made a splash for their sartorial choices while working as figure skating commentators at the @entity7 trying different styles : @entity4 and @entity3 made their fashion choices part of their broadcasts in @entity36 ( left ) and since returning to the @entity37 to their renewed celebrity ( right ) their involvement also shows how the network 's coverage now reflects one of the most female - friendly televised sporting events of the year			1
the image of cigar - chomping race fans no longer applies to horse racing 's signature event			1
slightly more than half of @entity2 's @entity5 viewers last year were women attracted to the party , the @entity52 company said			2
no other major tv sports event , with the exception of the @entity13 , is so weighted toward female viewers , @entity2 said			2
' it 's not just a two - minute race , ' said @entity62 , coordinating producer for the @entity64			0
bling : the duo will be focusing their attention on the fashions being worn by celebrities at the @entity5 as opposed to the costumes on the ice like they did in @entity36 ' of course , the two - minute race is extremely important , but our job is to capture the venue and the day — it 's a huge celebration — as creatively and poignantly as possible			1
' @entity62 produced @entity2 's ice skating coverage in @entity36 and saw firsthand how the rookie analyst team of @entity3 and @entity4 captured attention , primarily for their sense of style			1
their stars rising , the team was added to access @entity84 's coverage of the @entity26 , and now @entity2 's coverage of the @entity5 , scheduled may 3 from @entity86 in @entity87			2
' we 've always loved loud fashion and sort of bonded over it , ' @entity4 said			1
' the whole @entity13 experience was a bit of a surprise			0
we came in and were focused on doing a good job as rookies			0
but we 're young and we like to have fun			0
the fashion was specifically for us every day and it was like , “ oh , people are watching			0
” ’ particularly for @entity3 ; fans anticipated his wardrobe choices			2
continuing their collaboration post-olympics was a natural , @entity3 said , since they both follow fashion trends and designers closely as consumers			1
appealing to audiences : more than half of the television audience of the @entity5 were women so @entity2 's decision to enlist @entity3 and @entity4 shows them catering to the viewer 's interest in fashion ' we 've grown up as entertainers , and going out the door , what you 're wearing is often the loudest statement you can make , ' @entity3 said			1
they 're also no strangers to the horse racing world			0
@entity4 rode horses when she was younger and @entity3 was more active , competing in equestrian events before he focused on figure skating			1
@entity3 said he attended the @entity127 as a fan , earning money by betting on the winning horse			1
he also wore a giant , fur - covered sombrero , he said , raising anticipation for his outfit next week			0
' i 'm not such a sports guy , aside from what people may think , ' he said			0
' i love figure skating , i love my job , but aside from that , i prefer to run in meadows and chase butterflies			0
' @entity3 ’s time back from @entity18 has been turbulent as he and his husband have been rotating back and forth between divorce and reconciliation after the skater ’s lawyer husband released a photo showing that @entity3 bit and hit him during a violent outburst			1
most recently , @entity3 and his estranged husband @entity152 announced they were remaining apart just hours after deciding to give things another ago			2
it 's over ... again : @entity152 and @entity3 ( pictured at @entity156 in 2012 ) called off their reconciliation last week just hours after the estranged couple said they were getting back together as part of his conditions for reconciliation , @entity3 reportedly issued a five - page document including a list of no - no 's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation and bi-yearly std tests from both parties			2
the latest reports have the couple remaining apart			0
the subject matter of the storied race will undoubtedly remain more staid and civil , however			0
@entity2 's coverage is preceded by four hours on the @entity64 cable network			2
the first hour of @entity2 's three - hour @entity5 coverage will be entertainment - focused , including red carpet arrivals coverage			0
@entity2 is also distributing to its local affiliates stories offering tips on how to throw @entity5 parties , and how to mix the event 's signature drinks			0
the @entity5 coverage will also mark the @entity2 debut of @entity186 , who came to the network from @entity189 's ' @entity188			1
' he will be doing a series of taped pieces that are part of the coverage , along with celebrity interviews , @entity62 said			0
@entity2 's @entity5 telecast in 2013 was seen by 16.2 million viewers — 51 per cent of them women — and was the second most - watched @entity5 in 25 years .			0
