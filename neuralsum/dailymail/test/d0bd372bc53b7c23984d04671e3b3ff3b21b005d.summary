@entity67 today attempted to trump @entity3 on the @entity10 with a pledge to increase its budget by more than £ 8billion ambulance call out times are also under growing pressure , @entity3 said			1
in april 2011 , the average ambulance response time for immediately life - threatening call - outs was 5.30 minutes			0
by february 2015 response times had risen by 1.6 minutes to 6.91 minutes			0
if this trend were to continue over the next five years , the average ambulance response time in may 2020 would be 9.12 minutes , an increase of over two thirds on 2010			2
the @entity6 said @entity3 were using the @entity10 as a political football			1
a @entity82 spokesperson said : ' this marks a new low in @entity86 's desperate attempts to weaponise the @entity10			1
his credibility on health is in tatters because he refuses to fund the £ 8 billion the @entity10 needs			1
' by building a stronger economy , we have protected and improved the @entity10 with 9,500 more doctors , 6,900 more nurses , and 1.3 million more life - saving operations every year			2
' there is only one threat to the future of our nhs and that is the economic chaos of an @entity86 - @entity99 government			1
' the future of the straining health service has become one of the key battlegrounds of the general election , with conservatives and @entity105 pledging to find the £ 8 billion health chiefs say is needed by 2020 to prevent it buckling			1
@entity3 has refused to commit to providing the same amount but insists it will do ' what is necessary ' and says its £ 2.5 billion spending plans are the only fully - funded proposals put forward so far			2
in an election dossier on the @entity10 , @entity3 accuse the @entity6 of having a secret plan for @entity10 charging			1
it claims public spending under the @entity82 would drop to levels similar to countries that have greater charging in healthcare , such as @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			1
at the launch of @entity3 's week of @entity10 campaigning , shadow health secretary @entity8 said : ' this is the real face of the @entity82			1
they have let the cat out of the bag - five more years of @entity128 means more @entity10 privatisation and charging			1
' it is clear that , just like last time , @entity128 's @entity10 promises have an expiry date of election day stamped on them			2
he promised no top - down reorganisation and brought forward the biggest - ever top - down reorganisation			0
if he gets back in , the @entity10 will be sunk by a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation			2
' @entity128 and @entity142 , at a campaign event in @entity141 this morning , have accused the @entity3 of using the @entity10 as a political football shadow chancellor @entity7 added : ' @entity128 is a serial offender when it comes to claims at election time			1
he broke his promises on the @entity10 , on vat and on tax credits last time			2
and he 'll break his promises again			0
' because on top of their extreme spending plans to double the cuts next year , the @entity6 have made billions of pounds of unfunded commitments in this election , including £ 10 billion of tax cuts and billions of pounds for rail fare freezes and paid time off for public servants to volunteer			2
' and these unfunded promises will come before the @entity10 in the queue			2
' in a speech to the @entity163 mr @entity86 will say : ' the @entity82 plans on the @entity10 are a double deceit			1
' they are not being straight about their extreme plans to double the cuts to public services next year			0
' and they are not being straight when they promise to protect the @entity10 , but can not say where a penny of additional money will come from			2
' this double deceit is a double danger to the @entity10			0
they have extreme spending plans and they ca n't tell us where the money is coming from			0
' @entity128 poses a risk to the very fabric and foundation of our @entity10			0
' that 's why we will fight every day to may 7 to stop a @entity82 plan that threatens our @entity10			1
' and it 's why we have a different approach			0
' a fully funded plan , with a mansion tax on properties worth over £ 2 million to pay for more nurses and doctors in every part of the @entity188			0

@entity3 claims @entity10 ' can not survive ' another 5 years of @entity82 government
party points to figures showing a decline in standards in the health service
it claims if standards continue to drop at the current rate millions will suffer
but the @entity6 said @entity3 the warning marked a ' new low ' for @entity3
claimed @entity86 was making good on pledge to ' weaponise ' the @entity10
