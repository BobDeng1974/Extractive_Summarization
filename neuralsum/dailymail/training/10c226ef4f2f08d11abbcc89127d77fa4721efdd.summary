by @entity0 it was a remarkable step forward in warfare - and the first submarine in history to sink an enemy warship			2
the @entity6 , a hand - cranked submarine , was first launched in 1863 - but after sinking twice , was lost a year later for unknown reasons , killing all crew			2
the @entity6 was eventually discovered off the @entity11 coast in 1995 and raised in 2000			1
a drawing of @entity6 , based on a photograph taken in 1863 by @entity24 scientists near the city where the @entity27 began are now preparing to soak the encrusted @entity14 submarine in a chemical bath to reveal its hull for the first time in 150 years , seeking to solve the mystery of the demise of the first sub in history to sink an enemy warship			2
the hand - cranked @entity6 - which rests in a 76,000 - gallon conservation tank - will be treated with a solution of sodium hydroxide for about three months to loosen the encrustation coating the hull and interior of the sub			0
conservationists will drain the tank each day and later , wearing protective gear , use hand tools to remove the hard sand , sediment and rust coating the sub before refilling the tank each evening			0
' this is the end of the beginning ' of the preservation work , said @entity56 , the associate director of the @entity57 at @entity59 's @entity58			0
' in a year we may be able to have the clues			0
' removing the encrustation will reveal the original surface of the hull and with it any damage that could yield new clues to its sinking off @entity11 , @entity69 , in february 1864			1
the war had begun with the bombardment of @entity72 in @entity73 three years earlier			0
the sub and its crew of eight had set off a powder charge that sank the @entity79 blockade ship @entity78 as the @entity14 tried to break a @entity79 blockade of @entity11			1
the @entity6 , nearly 40 feet ( 12 m ) long , was built at @entity81 , @entity82 , and launched in july 1863			0
@entity6 was designed for a crew of eight : seven to turn the hand - cranked propeller and one to steer and direct the boat			2
each end was equipped with ballast tanks that could be flooded by valves or pumped dry by hand pumps			0
extra ballast was added through the use of iron weights bolted to the underside of the hull			0
inside the @entity6 : it was designed for a crew of eight : seven to turn the hand - cranked propeller and one to steer and direct the boat			2
in the event the submarine needed additional buoyancy to rise in an emergency , the iron weight could be removed by unscrewing the heads of the bolts from inside the vessel			0
she was then shipped by rail on august 12 , 1863 to @entity11 , @entity69			1
originally called @entity109 , the sub sank on august 29 , 1863 , during a training exercise , killing five members of her crew			1
however , it was found and refurbished , before she sank again on october 15 , 1863 , killing all eight of her second crew , including @entity118 himself , who was aboard at the time , even though he was not enlisted in the @entity14 armed forces			1
in the event the submarine needed additional buoyancy to rise in an emergency , the iron weight could be removed by unscrewing the heads of the bolts from inside the vessel			0
after being reused again , on february 17 , 1864 , @entity6 attacked and sank the 1240 - short ton ( 1124 metric tons ) screw sloop @entity78 on union blockade duty in @entity11 's outer harbor			1
soon after , @entity6 sank , killing all eight of her third crew - and researchers still have no idea why			1
but the @entity6 never returned and just why remains a mystery			0
the wreck was discovered off the coast in 1995			1
five years later , in august of 2000 , cannons boomed , church bells rang and thousands watched from the harborside as the 40 - foot - long sub was raised and brought by barge to the conservation lab. the silt - filled interior of the sub was later excavated and the remains of the crewmen removed			1
in april of 2004 , thousands of men in @entity14 gray and @entity79 blue walked in a procession with the crew 's coffins from @entity11 's waterfront battery to @entity156 in what has been called the last @entity14 funeral			1
the chemical bath will help remove salts and the encrustation on the submarine 's hull			0
the @entity164 sank a @entity79 blockade ship off the @entity69 coast in 1864			1
it was discovered in 1995 and raised in 2000 and brought to the @entity17 lab. last year , scientists announced it appears the charge that sank the @entity172 was attached to the 16 - foot spar at the front of the sub			1
that could mean the crew was knocked unconscious by the explosion and died before awakening			2
a closer look at the hull may provide clues			0
' chiseling away the concretion will allow us to travel back in time , potentially helping us learn what happened to the @entity6 and her crew that night , ' lt. gov. @entity183 , the chairman of the @entity69 @entity184 , said in a statement			2
@entity6 , suspended from a crane during its recovery from @entity73 , august 8 , 2000			2
when the @entity6 was raised , historians thought it was farther away from the @entity78 and speculated the crew ran out of air before they could crank the submarine back to the coast			1
@entity56 said while the encrustation on the hull should be removed in a year , the sub will have to soak in the chemical bath for at least four more years to remove salts in the metal and prevent further corrosion of the sub			0
eventually the @entity6 will be put on display in a new museum in @entity17 not far from the conservation lab.			0

@entity210 sank a @entity79 blockade ship off @entity11 in 1864
was discovered off the coast in 1995 and raised in 2000
researchers have been unable to find out why it sunk with crew still aboard
