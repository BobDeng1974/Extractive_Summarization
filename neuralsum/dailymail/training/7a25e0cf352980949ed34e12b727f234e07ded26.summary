@entity1 's blood is pumped around his body by a ventricular assist device union leader @entity1 has told how he was left without a pulse after catching a rare virus while out walking his dog			1
he suffered a mysterious heart failure four years ago , which eventually starved his internal organs of blood			1
it meant he had to be fitted with a £ 130,000 battery - powered device strapped to his waist which pumps blood around his body			1
he is one of between only 140 and 150 people to have one of the gadgets , called a ventricular assist device ( @entity18 )			1
from the pump , a cable runs under his ribs , out of his stomach and into the controller in a bumbag			0
the 51 - year - old head of the @entity26 , the biggest civil service union , said in an interview : ‘ when i ’m watching telly , i plug myself into the mains to charge the batteries			1
when i ’m driving , i use the cigarette lighter			0
’ vads have a tube that goes into the main artery , the aorta , and should not be switched off in case this triggers a clot			0
this means mr @entity1 and other patients like him fitted with one can not shower or take a bath			1
he also avoids taking public transport for fear of getting the cables snagged			0
he believes he picked up the virus while taking his black labrador , @entity46 , for a walk			0
the dog rolled in something disgusting and the next day ‘ my face , my legs , everything had swollen ’			0
his gp initially gave him antihistamines which seemed to do the trick until a week later , when mr @entity1 suddenly felt his heart ‘ going crazy ’			1
he was rushed to hospital where doctors assumed he was having a heart attack as his heartbeat was 220 beats per minute , more than double what that of a normal , resting adult should be			2
but mri scans showed heavy scars suggesting the virus from the week before had attacked his internal organs , including his heart			2
mr @entity1 , who lives in @entity83 with wife @entity84 and their two children , returned to work but his condition worsened dramatically in summer 2013			1
he told @entity89 : ‘ i could n’t walk 50 yards without being sick			0
i would retch 20 times a day			0
’ after being referred to specialist heart centre @entity90 in @entity92 , he was told he needed a heart transplant - but any new organ would fail because his lungs were so ravenous for blood they were exerting huge pressure			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ if i did n’t get treatment			1
i ’d have between one and three years			0
’ doctors decided to fit the @entity18 , which they hope will ease the pressure from his lungs so he can eventually have a transplant			2
the device took a six - hour operation to fit involving cutting through his breastbone and bending his ribs			2
mr @entity1 , who is now back at home and preparing to return to work this month , said : ‘ you can say , ‘ s * * * , i wish i ’d never taken the dog out that day			2
’ you can wonder , ‘ why me ? ’ ‘ but i ’m one of those who thinks the glass is half - full , rather than half - empty - even when it ’s only a quarter - full			0

@entity26 leader @entity1 fell ill in 2010
@entity115 gave him heart failure and at one point he was given a year to live
he could not have a transplant , as his lungs would cause him to *reject* it
but he was fitted with a ventricular assist device , which pumps his blood
he is one of just 140 or 150 people to have the £ 130,000 device
has a wire coming from his abdomen and into a pack around his waist
