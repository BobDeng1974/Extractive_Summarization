a study 's shown that a husband 's ' agreeable personality ' and good health plays a key role in preventing conflict in a marriage the stresses and strains of modern living mean that plenty of people seek a divorce			1
and a new study has shown that a husband ’s ‘ agreeable personality ’ and good health plays a key role in preventing conflict and an enduring marriage			1
scientists believe the same characteristics in wives play less of a role in limiting conflict between couples who have been together for a long time , however			1
‘ wives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health , ’ said @entity25 , phd candidate in the @entity26 at the @entity27			1
‘ if the wife is in poor health , there does n't seem to be any difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband , ’ he said			1
the study is based upon a @entity41 survey analysing the relationships of 953 heterosexual couples who are either married or living together			1
participants ranged in age from 63 to 90 years old and the average length of their relationships was 39 years			1
the survey of older adults participating in the @entity50 and @entity51 , which ran the survey , compared the characteristics of the husbands to the characteristics of their wives			0
each person was interviewed and asked to describe themselves			0
mr @entity25 and his co-authors found many gender differences when they examined personality traits including openness , experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness and anxiety			2
they added a new measure called ‘ positivity , ’ which was an overarching characteristic described as a person 's overall desire to be seen in a positive light			0
' wives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health , ' said @entity25 , phd candidate in the @entity26 at the @entity27			1
the study quizzed men and women who ranged in age from 63 to 90 years old who are in a relationship that has lasted for an average of 39 years a husband 's good healthy plays a key role in preventing conflict in a long marriage			1
wives report more conflict if their husband is ill.if a wife is in poor health there is little difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband			1
similarly , wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict in the marriage but their positivity had no association with their husband 's perception of problems			1
‘ wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict			0
however , the wives ' positivity had no association with their husbands ' reports of conflict , ’ he said			0
co-author @entity119 , @entity120 at the university , said the study 's measurement of marital conflict could be summarised as , ‘ how much does your spouse bother you ? ’ they found that clashes are not primarily about fighting or violence , but whether one spouse criticises the other , makes too many demands , or generally gets on the other person 's nerves			1
it also revealed that men who describe themselves as neurotic or extroverted tend to have wives who complain more about the quality of the marriage			0
men with self - described neurotic wives may consider worrying to be a more ‘ gender - appropriate ’ role for women , according to the study			1
@entity146 reported more criticism and demands from their wives overall , but also higher levels of emotional support			0
' wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict ( illustrated )			0
however , the wives ' positivity had no association with their husbands ' reports of conflict , ' according to the study professor @entity161 said : ‘ several previous studies have been about the implications of marital status on health			1
‘ this research allows us to examine individual marriages and not “ married people			0
” we have the reports on the quality of the marriage from each person , about their own personality and their own health			2
’ the researchers suggest that future studies might examine the question of whether low levels of conflict in marriages require not only the absence of factors , such as poor health and negative traits , but also a better balance of emotional responsibilities between husbands and wives			0
they believe some of the differences between husbands and wives may change as researchers study younger couples entering later life , compared to the current generation of older couples who may have more conventional gender roles			2
married women are 28 per cent less likely to die from heart disease than unmarried women - and it 's all down to nagging			2
researchers say that even though marriage makes no difference to women 's chances of developing heart disease , they are more likely to get treatment early is a partner constantly encourages them to			2
they also believe that getting married can lead to lifestyle changes and mean women are more likely to take medication			0
the scientists behind the study admit they do now know the reasons for this difference			2
however , dr @entity214 and colleagues at @entity217 's @entity216 suggest one explanation could be that the partners of married women may encourage them to seek early medical treatment for symptoms			0
' married women were no less likely to develop heart disease than women who were not married , but they were less likely to die from it , ' dr @entity214 said			0
' this means that , over 30 years , about three in 100 married women would die from heart disease compared with about four in 100 women who are not married or living with a partner			0
' other studies have also shown that partners tend to encourage their spouses to take medication and make changes in unhealthy lifestyles			0
the findings come from the latest analysis of data from a large @entity240 study of women 's health run by @entity217 researchers , the @entity243 .			2

@entity27 study found a husband 's good health plays a key role in preventing conflict between couples who live together long - term
if a wife is ill there is little difference in the quality of a marriage for the husband , scientists claim
participants in the study , which *highlights* gender difference in relationships , were married for an average of 39 years
