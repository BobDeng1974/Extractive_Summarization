by @entity1 reporter published : 05:28 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 28 november 2013 amid @entity4 's ferocious civil war , a nun has emerged as an unlikely power broker and figure of controversy			1
@entity8 has thrust herself into the role of go - between and publicist , arranging cease - fires , organizing pro-government media trips and conducting speaking tours as perhaps the country 's most prominent critic of the uprising against president @entity18			1
anti-government activists scathingly call her ' @entity18 's nun ' for claiming a chemical attack that killed hundreds was exaggerated , and for saying rebels used kidnapped babies in massacres that were blamed on @entity4 forces			1
unlikely saviour ? : @entity27 walks with people fleeing the rebel held suburb of @entity31 to the government held territory in @entity34 , @entity4 peacemaker ? @entity8 holds hands with people fleeing the rebel stronghold after arranging a temporary ceasefire she is so despised by the opposition that even acts of seeming goodwill are criticized , such as arranging a rare truce that allowed thousands to leave a blockaded town			1
supporters see her as a brave truth - teller , and she reflects the fears of many @entity4 who worry that hard - line @entity51 rebels trying to overthrow @entity18 will make life intolerable for @entity53 and other minorities			1
the nun insists she is not an @entity18 propagandist , describing his family 's decades - long hold over @entity4 as a ' tumor , ' but she saves her harshest criticism for the rebels			1
' the rebels presented themselves as the doctor who will remove this tumor , ' she said in a recent @entity66 interview			0
' they imposed arms as a treatment , and it is killing @entity4			1
' @entity70 , 61 , was born @entity71 in @entity72 to @entity74 refugees			0
in the social upheaval of the 1960s , @entity71 was a self - described hippie and trekked to @entity78 on what she called a spiritual journey that led her to @entity81			0
she moved to @entity4 two decades ago , establishing a new order within the @entity83 , @entity84 of @entity85 , and founded the @entity87 convent 55 miles ( 90 kilometers ) north of @entity34			1
outspoken : the nun has been perhaps the most prominent critic of the uprising against president @entity18 ( pictured ) the nun was skeptical of the two - year - old @entity4 uprising from the start			1
she claimed much of the footage of @entity95 demonstrations posted to social media networks was faked , along with video of @entity4 forces beating and killing protesters the @entity4 government heavily restricts foreign reporting on the fighting			1
but @entity70 organized pro-government media tours , using her connections to obtain visas for journalists			0

in may 2012 , after @entity18 - loyal forces massacred dozens of @entity119 men , women and children in the @entity122 , she claimed the slain children were alawites - members of @entity18 's sect - who had been kidnapped by rebels			1
she made a similar claim after hundreds of civilians were killed in a chemical attack on rebel - held suburbs of @entity34 on august 21			1
in a 50 - page report , she said the children were probably kidnapped because their mothers were n't in the videos that activists uploaded to @entity136			2
she also claimed some videos were faked so victims would appear more numerous			2
her report was cited by @entity141 's foreign minister to cast doubt on claims that @entity18 forces perpetrated the attack			1
@entity146 of @entity147 said @entity149 's allegations were ' based on bizarre theories about bodies being moved			2
' he said it is normal for the bodies of men and women to be separated so that they can be ritually washed according to @entity159 custom			0
most recently , @entity70 surprised reporters in late october by appearing in her black habit and white wimple outside the rebel - held town of @entity31 , where she brokered a truce allowing residents to be evacuated from the besieged area			0
controversy : the nun has played down reports of atrocities on the part of @entity18 's forces since the uprising began @entity70 said she got involved after seeing photographs of starving @entity177 children on her @entity179 feed			1
' i said , " this does n't happen in @entity4 , " ' she said			2
the nun contacted other government and security officials she knew from decades of interfaith outreach			2
she said she gradually built up her connections through her ' pushy ' personality and constant lobbying , saying people found it hard to refuse a nun			2
the truce failed several times , but over a series of days , some 5,000 people were evacuated			0
activist @entity196 , however , accused of nun of breaking her word by allowing @entity18 's security forces to seize men suspected of being armed rebels as they left			1
violence : residents gather at a site hit by what activists say was a @entity208 missile from forces loyal to @entity4 's president @entity18 in @entity210 , eastern @entity4 this morning @entity196 said she bears responsibility for their fate if they were tortured or killed in custody			1
the nun said the men were taken to determine their status as civilians or fighters			0
she said that two men disappeared but that volunteers were trying to locate them			0
@entity224 , an official at the @entity226 - based @entity225 , which oversees @entity70 's convent , would not comment directly on her work and said her statements do not reflect the opinion of the @entity83			0
@entity70 is now on a speaking tour of the @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234			0
but she withdrew from an anti-war conference in @entity236 this weekend after other speakers threatened to quit if she participated			0
devastation : civilians and rescuers search under rubble at a site hit by what activists say was a @entity208 missile from @entity18 's forces in @entity234 's weekly spectator , one writer called her ' the @entity4 equivalent of one of @entity253 's brown priests			1
' @entity146 of @entity147 said she ' abuses her religious status to spread her lies			0
' to others , she is a humanitarian who is informing the @entity260 by correcting biased media reporting			0
' she is searching for the truth about what is happening in @entity4 , ' said @entity34 - based freelance reporter @entity264			2
for her part , the nun said she is doing her flawed best			0
' i am not the awaited - for @entity267 , ' she said			0
' i am trying to work as a human			0
