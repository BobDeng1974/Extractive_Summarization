by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 11:02 est , 3 december 2012 @entity1 has been accused of a massive ' data grab ' after encouraging users to allow it to automatically synchronise photos from their mobile devices to the social networks servers			1
the social network from friday began asking users of its mobile apps to activate its new @entity11 , which will automatically upload each picture to a private album			1
whether or not users decide share the photos on their public newsfeed , @entity1 itself will still have access			2
that means it will be able to mine those files for their metadata , including the location where the photo was taken , as well as use its facial recognition technology to spot those pictured			0
photo sync : the new function being promoted to users of @entity1 's mobile apps will automatically upload pictures taken from mobile devices to the company 's servers - where they can be mined for data as a result , over time , @entity1 will be able to build up a comprehensive database of where users have been , and with whom , from information they automatically give to the company			1
@entity44 , deputy director of civil liberties campaign group @entity45 , said : ' this provides a stark warning about the loss of control experienced once you have installed an application to your mobile phone			0
' privacy is clearly at the very back of the @entity1 's mind when creating an application that enables this kind of uploading of photographs to be easier when it , in fact , it should be made more difficult			1
' the @entity11 feature , which was launched on friday with no public announcement from @entity1 , is being promoted by a banner at the top of the news feed of its mobile applications			2
once activated it allows the most recent pictures taken on users ' smart phones to be background uploaded straight to a private album on @entity1 's servers , where they will sit pending approval for publication			1
a q&a on @entity1 's help pages stresses that the album remains private , but experts say the social network will benefit from swathes of picture metadata that will enable it to find out unprecedented details about users ' lives			1
at its most basic level it could enable them to tailor advertising by location			0
however , combined with @entity1 's facial recognition technology it could also automatically find out who users have been socialising with and where			1
@entity1 ceo @entity98 : photo sync is set to provide his company with an avalanche of data it could use to build detailed pictures of users ' lives the same technology could also potentially be used for brand recognition , @entity109 reported , allowing @entity1 to even identify the types of trainers users are wearing and tailor adverts to suit			1
the automatic nature of the service also suggests that @entity1 is set to gain access to users ' most private photos , including some that may violate its notorious terms of service			2
@entity109 writer @entity122 said the service is essentially @entity1 's entry into cloud storage			1
' @entity1 wants to help you share your life , ' he wrote			0
' you capture more angles and perspectives of your life through your camera than you might want to share			0
' that means it can either make you decide what to upload and what to share , or eliminate the first decision , take care of that seamlessly in the background , and only ask you to choose what to publish			0
' @entity1 mobile app users can activate the @entity11 function by merely clicking ' get started ' on a banner currently displayed at the top of the newsfeed			1
once enabled , every picture taken on the device will be uploaded to the company 's servers with no user interference or further approval needed			1
so far the @entity1 allows for about @entity151 of uploads , with users having to manually delete images to upload more once the limit has been reached			2
@entity1 says it will ' generally try to sync your photos as soon as you take them ' , but the service also has a range of features to lessen its potential impact on users ' phone bills and the battery life of their phones			2
' when you 're on a cellular network like @entity170 or @entity171 , we 'll sync photos at a smaller size ( around 100k each ) , so they 're unlikely to use much of your data plan , ' the company says , adding that larger versions will be synced if the device is connected to a @entity178 network			0
unlike @entity1 's facial - recognition technology , which was recently banned in @entity181 , users will have to opt in to begin using @entity11			1
however , the potential remains that unsuspecting users will find a host of pictures uploaded to the internet that had been intended for their eyes only			0
internet security company @entity189 warned : ' you are no longer in charge of what photos you upload to @entity1			0
' in the past , you could decide what images you uploaded to the social network , and which pictures it could analyse for its own purposes			2
' now , all photos - good and bad - will be available to @entity1			0
' big brother watch 's @entity44 added : ' this is yet another example of profit coming before privacy			0
if a company cares about the privacy of its customers it ensures that they are fully aware of how their information is being gathered and for what purposes			0
' companies that do n't care act like @entity1			0
' @entity212 contacted @entity1 's representatives for comment , but none were available .			2

photo sync being *aggressively* promoted to @entity1 's mobile app users
it will upload every single picture taken to the social network 's servers
@entity1 will benefit from huge *windfall* of data it can *commercialise*
it could use that data to build detailed database of users ' lives
