they are known some of the most deadly animals in the sea - responsible for a large percentage of fatal human attacks			1
but these divers are unfazed as they feed tiger sharks by hand off the coast of the @entity9			1
@entity11 underwater photographer @entity10 , 44 , captured the photographs in a shallow sand bank off the coast of @entity15			1
@entity10 , now living in @entity31 , @entity32 , explains : ' in these photographs you see a tiger shark coming to feed at the bait crate for the first time			2
' the bait crate is used to establish a connection between divers and sharks			0
' in this case it was used to gain trust in order to remove hooks from their mouths , which had been put there by hunters			0
the tiger shark , among the most dangerous shark species for human fatalities , is not afraid to show its teeth as it prepares to be fed the shark proves it is impatient as it tries to get at the food being held under the basket by ms @entity19 ms @entity10 says the situation is n't dangerous if you accept you are entering the shark 's realm when you head underwater the dramatic images were taken off the coast of the aptly - named @entity15 in the @entity9 ' the shark handler was @entity19			1
she 's a delicate 5ft tall , fragile looking mother - of - one , and she runs a shark diving operation with her husband @entity69			0
' when i saw @entity19 handling the shark and gaining its trust , i , as a woman , felt proud			2
' the shark diving world is still dominated by men , where lots of adrenaline and action can be found , but it does not have to be like this			0
' more and more women are proving that peaceful encounters can be just as fulfilling			0
' spending a total of eight hours with the sharks , @entity10 was able to photograph the creatures 23ft deep underwater and watch as the instructors fed them			0
ms @entity19 offers diving trips for holidaymakers to get up - close to the sharks that swim in the waters off various different beaches ms @entity10 spent eight hours with the sharks in total in order to capture the spectacular images the tiger shark is a solitary , mostly nocturnal hunter , and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks , consuming a variety of prey ranging from fish , seals , birds , squid , turtles , dolphins and even other smaller sharks			1
although shark attacks are a relatively rare phenomenon , the tiger shark is responsible for a large percentage of fatal attacks and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species			1
ms @entity10 says : ' it 's not dangerous if you are well informed and know what to do			0
the tiger shark seems unfazed by the scuba divers who gathered to capture images and footage of the dangerous animals ' in my opinion descending and ascending is the trickiest part of those shark dives , not because of the sharks but because of the current and your position and place in the water			1
' if you enter the water with sharks you have to be aware that you enter their realm and you have to adapt			0
' having an eye on all sharks at any time and knowing how to react when they come too close for comfort is the key ! ' while a lot of people do n't like the idea of feeding marine life , we have to admit that this allows us to come in close contact with sharks and capture images of them that can educate people that sharks are no man - eaters or mindless killers , and that we need to protect them			2
