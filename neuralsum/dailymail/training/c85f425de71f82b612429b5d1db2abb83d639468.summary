by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:24 est , 27 february 2014 now is it time for @entity4 to sack @entity5 ? @entity6 appears to have taken a thinly - veiled dig at @entity8			1
the @entity4 striker criticised @entity5 ' side in the wake of their dismal 2 - 0 defeat at @entity14			1
and @entity6 posting a picture on @entity16 claiming , ' without your teammates you ca n't be somebody in football , always be thankful ... ' @entity23 's future at @entity24 is shrouded in mystery			1
@entity49 can reveal that goalkeeper @entity50 completed more passes to @entity23 than all but two of @entity4 â€™s attacking personnel			1
the @entity56 keeper delivered two balls to his @entity59 colleague , and that was one more than @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 managed			0
@entity64 and @entity65 , meanwhile , failed to make a single pass to @entity23			0
following the @entity69 humiliation the frustrated frontman gave an interview to @entity59 tv channel @entity71 and made clear his opinions on why his form had dipped			0
when asked whether he was allowed deep to collect the ball , @entity23 said : ' our fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces i want to play in			1
' and when i see that , it makes it difficult for me to come to those spaces as well			0
so that forces me to adjust my runs , based on the position of my fellow players			1
' and , unfortunately , they are often playing in my zones			0
i think that 's a shame			0
' ca n't create the space ? @entity23 enjoyed very few touches during the humiliating defeat in @entity94 any new ideas ? @entity23 said that @entity5 was working hard to turn around their slump drawing a blank : @entity23 has only scored once in the @entity69 this season the striker 's best chance of the night came in the second half when he fired over the crossbar having fashioned a yard inside the area			1
' i rushed that shot [ to make it 2 - 1 late in the game ] ' , @entity23 admitted			2
' that 's a shame because i do n't get a lot of chances , so when you get one , you have to score			2
' he also responded to criticism of @entity5 , who has been under constant pressure during @entity4 's poor run of results in recent months			2
holding him back : @entity23 seemed to suggest his team - mates are affecting his natural game but offered his support to under - fire boss @entity5 @entity23 said : ' he 's working hard at it and so are we			1
sometimes we play well but not all the time			0
we do n't have luck on our side			2
it 's easy to point the finger at someone but i 'm not like that			0
we have to do better ourselves			0
' with all due respect , we should be able to defeat this team 2 - 0 or 3 - 0			2
