by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 3 november 2013 while @entity3 students are often stereotyped as bookworms with no common sense , new research has shown that they are actually picking up vital life skills while studying			1
among them are the ability to turn on a grill , how to set up the internet , and how to budget			2
the list does little to undermine stereotypes however , as playing pub games , blagging essays and the effectiveness of napping all come high up			1
other strange pieces of wisdom picked up between library sessions include the fact that fridges do n't clean themselves , and why it is a bad idea to eat mould			2
a list of the top 50 ' life skills ' gained while at @entity26 has been published , revealing that students learn how to study all night and survive three days without sleep a spokeswoman for @entity30 , which conducted the research to mark the release of @entity34 's @entity33 , said : ' no matter which walk of life you come from , it would seem that university is a great leveller			1
' learning day to day basics such as budgeting , how to book a doctor 's appointment and using a washing machine along with finding out who you are and want to become is integral to the whole university experience			0
' there 's definitely a valuable alternative curriculum at @entity26 with some of it more fun than others			1
while some practical skills were picked up , such as basic diy and how to tune a television , the benefits of napping were also in the top 50 ' not only does our research confirm this but it also reveals this is not particular to just today 's generation of university students it also applies to previous generations			1
' two thirds of students said that the experience of moving away from home had been a ' real eye opener ' with nearly half saying that they were shocked by how little they knew when mum and dad were no longer around			0
in fact new students called home on average 20 times a month to check how to do things , though that lessened as time went on			0
luckily for parents , however , those surveyed also said they only really started to appreciate home after they had gone			0
it took people four months to feel settled in their new accomodation , with five months passing before they knew who their friends were going to be			0
among the hardest challenges were learning to live with strangers , making new friends , and mixing with people from different backgrounds .			0
