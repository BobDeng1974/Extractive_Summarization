by @entity0 @entity2 chiefs at one of @entity5 ’s worst hospitals have come up with a bizarre strategy for improving patient care - allowing staff to use @entity8 and @entity9 on the wards			1
bosses at @entity12 ( @entity13 ) decided to unblock social networks for doctors and nurses on all computers just days after sir @entity18 named and shamed it for having unacceptably high mortality rates			1
patient safety campaigner @entity21 , who helped expose the horrific neglect at @entity23 which cost up to 1,400 lives - including her own mother - blasted the decision			0
critical : @entity21 , left , blasted the decision to allow doctors and nurses to access social networking sites while on the wards - especially in hospitals criticised in a damning report by sir @entity18 , right the founder of @entity36 the @entity2 pressure group said : ‘ this raises serious concerns			1
i just ca n’t see the point of it			0
they should be spending time with patients			0
' @entity44 should be the priority			0
and while they ’re spending time on @entity8 and @entity9 that does n’t indicate that ’s what they going to be doing			0
‘ it ’s particularly disappointing to hear this @entity2 trust is doing this given their history of treating patients			0
’ @entity13 was recently put in special measures after it emerged as one of 11 failing @entity57			0
it is also the same trust which paid £ 500,000 to gag a whistleblower from revealing details about patient safety concerns			1
yet now staff in @entity64 are encouraged to use @entity8 and @entity9 from hospital computers ' for their own communications '			2
an email , which was sent from the @entity68 on july 29 , highlighted a scheme of ‘ quick wins ’ to improve performance across its ailing hospitals			0
it told staff : ' we have taken the step to open up all social media websites , such as @entity9 and @entity8 , for use by @entity12 staff			1
' from now on , you will be able to access these websites from all @entity12 computers			1
' changes : @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , pictured , is one of the sites where nurses will be able to access @entity9 and twitter while on the wards the policy was one of the first repsonses to the announcement that the @entity12 was named as one of the worst in @entity5 in the damning @entity18 review			1
the move means doctors and nurses can post on sites such as @entity9 and @entity8 during work hours , sparking fears they could be distracted from treating patients			1
before the @entity18 review was published , @entity106 staff could not access social networks on hospital networks			1
a hospital worker , who did not want to be named , said : ' managers say it ’s to help staff communicate between hospitals but that ’s rubbish			2
we already have an internal email and computer system funded at great expense by the taxpayer which we can use for that			0
' the last thing this hospital and its patients need is staff getting distracted by @entity9 and @entity8 whilst at work			1
' it 's hard to see how staff can focus on change at the same time as being allowed to fritter away time on social @entity132 computers are all over the wards			2
' previously @entity8 and @entity9 were blocked but now they ’re unblocked , it does n’t make any sense			0
but a @entity12 spokesman defended the move , saying it was intended to promoted ' openness and transparency ' within the organisation			1
a spokeswoman said : ' it is not unusual for @entity57 to make social networking sites available for their staff			2
' we made the decision to open up access to social networking sites as a result of staff feedback that we needed to explore new ways of ensuring effective communication with our employees across four hospital sites			1
' this is one of many actions taken to improve communication with staff and to encourage a culture of trust , openness and transparency within the organisation			2
' @entity13 was rated among the worst of 11 trusts placed under ‘ close watch ’ after sir @entity18 ’s review into hospital death rates was published in july this year			0
inspectors found there had been 12 ‘ never ’ events - potentially life - threatening but avoidable mistakes - within the trust			0
@entity13 announced this week it was to hire dozens of foreign nurses after staffing levels were criticised			2
a former @entity2 hospital chief turned whistleblower was paid £ 500,000 in a ‘ supergag ’ deal to prevent him discussing his concerns about patient safety			1
@entity180 , pictured right , said he was asked to ‘ compromise the safety of patients in order to achieve @entity186 targets ’ at the @entity187 where he worked			0
@entity189 mp @entity188 compared the situation to the scandal at @entity192 where up to 1,200 patients died ‘ unnecessarily ’ because of the focus on targets			0
he said he suspected there has been a scandal of ‘ similar proportions ’ at @entity187			0
mr @entity180 , 42 , was sacked from his £ 140,000 - a - year post in february 2010 after allegations that he swore in meetings , but his supporters claimed it was a trumped - up charge			2
they said that prior to his dismissal , the chief executive – who rescued the @entity12 from £ 24.5million debts – had a serious disagreement with his superiors over the direction of health policies			1
he took his employers to a tribunal to claim unfair dismissal , but signed a deal with the @entity12 before the hearing was due to begin in april last year			2
the tribunal judge had already found evidence mr @entity180 had made disclosures about patient safety , which were protected under whistleblowing laws			0
the patient mortality rate at the @entity12 , including the rate for emergency admissions , was above the expected rate for the last three years , according to an independent analysis			2
mr @entity180 ’s supporters told the @entity228 the @entity12 paid him ‘ hush money ’ to prevent the public discovering that senior clinicians had raised concerns about risks to patients			1
@entity235 , a former chairman of the same trust who resigned in 2009 over @entity2 targets , said he had also received a gagging letter after being called as a tribunal witness			0
he said : ‘ the real question is if you sack somebody and you do n’t pay them off , why do you spend £ 500,000 trying to cover up what they have to say ? ’			1

staff at @entity249 urged to access sites while on wards
unblocking websites was *response* to staff feedback , bosses admit
move sparks fears nurses and doctors will be distracted
same @entity12 paid £ 500,000 to gag whistleblower
