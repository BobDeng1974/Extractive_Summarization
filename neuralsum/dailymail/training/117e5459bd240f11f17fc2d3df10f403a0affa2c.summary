by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 3 april 2013 some drivers have been charged £ 2 a tank more for petrol than motorists in neighbouring towns over @entity6 due to some retailers failing to pass on a dip in wholesale petrol costs millions of motorists are paying up to £ 2 more a time to fill up than drivers in neighbouring towns in a petrol pricing lottery , the @entity10 warned yesterday			1
drivers have been left ‘ high and dry ’ by the widespread differences in fuel costs prompted by a refusal by some forecourts to pass on a recent drop in wholesale petrol prices			1
and the motoring group warned that prices across the country are expected to jump again in the next few weeks , bringing misery to small businesses and families who rely on their cars			2
average prices hit a year high of 140p a litre at the start of last month , but have since fallen back to a current average of 137.8p			1
but across the country there remain large discrepancies in what forecourts are charging , even in towns a few miles apart			0
in @entity40 , the cheapest petrol available on tuesday was 134.7p for a litre of unleaded			2
but in nearby @entity44 , the best price was 138.9p – about £ 2 extra to fill up a tank			2
the best deal in @entity47 , @entity48 , was 137.9p a litre , over three pence more than the 134.7p charged just 20 miles away in @entity51			0
and in @entity53 , @entity54 , the cheapest petrol was 134.7p per litre compared with 138.9p , 11 miles down the road in @entity56			2
the @entity10 said most towns enjoying cheaper prices have a @entity59 ’s which sells petrol			1
the supermarket giant recently dropped prices by 4p a litre to reflect the reduction in wholesale costs , prompting forecourts in surrounding areas to do the same in order to remain competitive			1
wholesale petrol costs started to rise again last week as the market anticipated greater demand with the start of the @entity75 ' motoring season @entity76 , spokesman for the @entity10 , said : ‘ in towns where there is n’t a @entity59 ’s selling petrol , there is much less incentive for petrol stations to reduce their charges			1
’ and in a double blow for motorists , he also warned petrol prices were expected to rise further as global demand increased in the coming months			1
he said : ‘ larger companies will be able to ride out the hikes , but many others will have to make a bleak choice			0
some motorists who ca n’t afford any more rises are simply going to spend the same amount on fuel each month and stop driving when they run out			0
‘ others , especially tradesmen who rely on using cars or vans , will either have to take it on the chin , or pass it on to customers , which risks losing customers and potentially going to the wall			0
it ’s a very grim situation			0
’ the @entity10 said average diesel prices continue to fall , down from a year high of 146.46p a litre on march 4 to 143.57p on @entity111			1
record fuel prices were set in april last year , with petrol hitting 142.48p a litre and diesel 147.91p			1
@entity10 president @entity116 said : ‘ fuel pricing in the @entity118 , @entity75 , and @entity119 over the past 12 months has been characterised by a series of severe spikes , surging petrol prices up and down by the equivalent of 10p a litre			1
this has had a severe impact on consumer demand			0
‘ although previous price spikes since the 1970s have eventually been offset by improved wages , the extent and severity of price swings since 2008 are likely to have a lasting impact			0
’ he added : ‘ unlike the @entity75 , drivers in the @entity118 and @entity119 have been left high and dry by the lack of fuel price transparency			2
‘ this has denied them the ability to spot short - term pump price spikes			0
it has also allowed retailers to decide when and where savings for this essential part of family spending are passed on			0

some retailers failing to pass on a dip in wholesale petrol costs , claim @entity10
group say average petrol prices in @entity118 appear to have *stalled*
average price hit year high of *140.03p* a litre on march 3
but later fell to 137.72p on march *24*
