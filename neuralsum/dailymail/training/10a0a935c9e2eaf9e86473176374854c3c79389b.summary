teenage girls are risking their lives using counterfeit abortion pills bought online for as little as 78p each because they are too terrified to tell their parents they are pregnant , experts warn			1
the drugs , which have labelled ' modern - day back street abortions ' , are easily available from hundreds of pharmacy sites , but they can be fatal if taken in wrong doses			1
most of the drugs come from @entity11 where legal loopholes mean domestic firms are allowed to produce generic versions of branded medicines			2
desperation : teenage girls are turning to counterfeit abortion pills bought online , because they are too terrified to tell their parents they are pregnant however some are now understood to be imported from @entity20 where they are produced by criminal gangs with no regulation or quality control , the @entity18 reports			1
@entity24 , chief executive of the @entity25 , said : ' it is extremely troubling if any woman feels her only course of action is to buy this medication online to end her pregnancy			2
' with the appalling exception of @entity33 , abortion in the @entity35 is safe , free , and confidential for women , including teenagers , up to 24 weeks of pregnancy			1
' the biggest risk when you buy online is that you do n't know what you are getting , nor what doses are needed for it to work			2
while medical abortion is safe , this is not something women should have to go through without clinical advice and support in place			2
side - effects of taking the tablets include excessive bleeding , infections of the womb and , in rare cases , blood poisoning			0
women who have this type of abortion are twice as likely to need hospital treatment as those who have the procedure done surgically			1
up to 1.5 per cent are admitted to hospital suffering from complications , compared with 0.6 per cent who have surgery			0
around 1 per cent develop pelvic inflammatory disease , an infection of the womb which can cause infertility			0
and in some cases women have lost so much blood they have needed a transfusion			0
most suffer pain or cramps in the abdomen			0
@entity75 , nausea and vomiting are also common			0
there have been two known deaths caused by early medical abortion tablets since they were first offered in @entity35 in 1991 ' women should know that they can access free abortion services often without seeing their gp , and we would urge any woman considering this to contact us in total confidence for help			1
' but there is a lesson for all of us here - it illustrates that any attempts to further restrict the already heavily regulated area of abortion will simply lead to women taking their health into their own hands			2
online pills will be the backstreet abortions of the @entity102			1
' the pills allow women to terminate their pregnancies quickly and quietly in their own home rather than having to make several trips to a clinic , which may involve taking time off work or school			1
they are far cheaper than having the treatment privately , which can cost up to £ 500			1
women who have this type of abortion are twice as likely to need hospital treatment as those who have the procedure done surgically			1
side - effects from taking the tablets include excessive bleeding , infections of the womb and , in rare cases , blood poisoning			0

but since then the price appears to have plummeted			0
dr @entity129 of the @entity130 said : ‘ there is still a social prejudice about abortions			0
‘ women may turn to these websites because they are embarrassed or they are just so appalled by their pregnancy			0
