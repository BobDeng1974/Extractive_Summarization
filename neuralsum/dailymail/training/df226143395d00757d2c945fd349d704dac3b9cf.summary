@entity1 's new radical left wing finance minister arrived for a crunch @entity3 meeting with @entity5 this morning wearing a leather jacket and a casual blue shirt without a tie			1
following his meeting with economics professor @entity10 , @entity5 warned that a euro zone stand - off over @entity1 debt is becoming the biggest risk to the global economy			1
@entity10 , who studied at @entity28 , yesterday secured backing from @entity50 for his country 's bid to renegotiate its debt			1
his meeting with @entity5 today was intended to convince @entity18 to make a similar declaration of support for repayment plans outlined by @entity1 's new left wing ruling party @entity58			1
following this morning 's meeting , @entity5 said : ' we had a constructive discussion , and it is clear that the stand - off between @entity1 and the euro zone is the greatest risk to the global economy			1
' ' it is a rising threat to the @entity18 economy			1
and we have got to make sure that in @entity19 as in @entity18 , we choose competence over chaos , ' he added			1
handshake : the pair exchanged a warm welcome on the doorstep of number 11 welcome to @entity3 : the @entity1 finance minister 's distinctive leather jacket was not the usual attire for a high profile diplomatic meeting ' i urge the @entity1 finance minister to act responsibly but it 's also important that the euro zone has a better plan for jobs and growth , ' @entity5 went on to say			1
the election of @entity58 last week sent shockwaves through @entity19			2
@entity91 , leader of the radical left - wing party heading the new coalition , immediately demanded a renegotiation of @entity1 ' £ 179 billion international bailout deal			1
@entity10 opted for a casual look to meet the @entity18 chancellor at @entity3 today , arriving in a leather jacket before changing into a suit jacket , albeit without a tie			2
@entity91 has also opted for a decidedly casual look since becoming @entity1 's youngest ever prime minister , joking that he wo n't be seen wearing a tie until @entity1 's debt repayment is renegotiated			2
discussion : following this morning 's meeting ( pictured ) , @entity5 said : ' we had a constructive discussion , and it is clear that the stand - off between @entity1 and the euro zone is the greatest risk to the global economy ' relaxed : @entity10 opted for a casual look to meet the @entity18 chancellor at @entity3 today , arriving in a leather jacket before changing into a suit jacket , albeit without a tie @entity10 secured backing from @entity50 for his country 's bid to renegotiate its debt during discussions in @entity122 yesterday , where he began a whistle - stop tour , meeting @entity19 counterparts			1
but @entity126 chancellor @entity125 has made it clear she will not allow @entity1 's debts to be cancelled , insisting substantial cuts have already been made			0
before the meeting this morning , @entity5 said : ' i welcome this opportunity , so soon after the @entity1 election , to discuss face to face with @entity10 the stability of the @entity19 economy and how to boost its growth			1
' following @entity58 shock election last week @entity91 immediately demanded a renegotiation of @entity1 's international bailout deal			2
@entity141 initially responded to @entity58 's rise to power by warning it would increase ' economic uncertainty across @entity19 ' but later offered the new leader @entity18 help on tax collection			0
@entity10 , who studied at the @entity28 , has ruled out a new wave of bail - out support , insisting his government was focused on ending the ' addiction ' that has seen @entity1 ' craving the next dose '			1
anger : following @entity58 's shock election victory last week , new prime minister @entity91 ( pictured ) immediately demanded a renegotiation of @entity1 's international bailout deal new era : @entity58 supporters gathered in central athens cheered after the party won the election last week though @entity18 is not part of the euro , @entity10 sought to build rapport with @entity5 with face - to - face talks			1
@entity3 said @entity18 's position is one of continuity - and that @entity1 should honor the terms of its bailout			2
@entity91 today struck a more conciliatory tone , meanwhile			0
he says the @entity1 people expect him to carry out tough negotiations with eurozone creditors , but ' within a @entity19 framework			0
' @entity91 ruled out suggestions that his government may reach out to @entity178 for a loan , saying his government 's primary objective is to conclude a deal with @entity1 's @entity19 partners and ' all those who have loaned to our country and to whom our country has obligations			2
' @entity91 said he was surprised many ' powerful @entity19 forces ' back his government 's call for a policy about - face from austerity to growth - oriented policies			0
but he condemned creditors ' demands for painful budget measures in exchange for the loans , saying ' people need room to breathe			0
' who is @entity10 ? the election in @entity1 of the radical left - wing @entity58 party has seen the economics professor plucked from a life quietly writing ' obscure academic texts ' to take the political centre stage as his country 's new finance minister with the responsibility for fixing its broken economy			1
he may be new to political life but has already shown himself to be handy with a soundbite , describing the austerity regime imposed by @entity1 's creditors as ' fiscal water - boarding '			0
why is he in @entity26 ? mr @entity10 is doing the round of @entity19 capitals trying to drum up support for his attempts to renegotiate the terms of @entity1 's £ 179 billion bailout imposed by the so - called ' troika ' of the @entity227 , the @entity228 and the @entity229			1
his message is the current repayment schedule is simply unaffordable and is stymieing any hopes of a recovery			0
how has it been going ? not well			0
when @entity236 , head of the eurozone ministers , visited @entity238 it proved to be a distinctly frosty encounter			0
mr @entity10 said that @entity1 was not prepared to co-operate any more with this ' rottenly - constructed committee '			2
a testy mr @entity241 warned him ignoring previous agreements was ' not the way forward '			0
mr @entity10 did receive a warmer reception in @entity122 , where the socialist government said it was prepared to help his country find a new settlement with its creditors			0
who holds the key to resolving the stand - off ? all eyes in @entity19 are on chancellor @entity125			0
@entity126 is @entity1 's biggest creditor and - to put it mildly - mrs @entity125 has shown no enthusiasm for any debt forgiveness , arguing that creditors have already taken one ' haircut '			0
she knows @entity126 taxpayers see no reason why they should pick up the tab for the @entity1 ' bills			0
expect some tense negotiations over the coming weeks in what looks like coming down to a war of nerves between @entity267 and @entity238 .			0

urged @entity19 to ' choose competence over chaos ' in @entity1 debt standoff
