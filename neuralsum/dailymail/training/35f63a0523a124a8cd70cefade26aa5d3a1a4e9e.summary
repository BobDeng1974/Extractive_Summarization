the free runner , originally from the @entity12 , @entity13 , was challenged to jump the course by his girlfriend , event rider @entity15			1
mr @entity6 , 22 , covered every jump that was open for members of the public to walk around on the final day of the three - day event , on monday - including the notorious fences in @entity4 's famous lake			1
the amazing video shows @entity6 clearing the double brush fence in the water on the course in @entity41 , @entity42 , with ease			2
it is the exact same spot where @entity7 was forced to retire from the competition after her horse , @entity47 , crashed into a fence flag			0
mr @entity6 with his girlfriend @entity15 who still insists the course is more difficult on a horse mr @entity6 's score for the course would have been higher than that of @entity7 but the course took the free runner almost four hours , far longer than the 11 minute 13 second limit mr @entity6 has been free running since he was in high school and is now a professional he travelled from @entity60 , @entity61 , to complete the course at @entity4 , @entity42 horse riders have competed at @entity4 since 1964 despite clearing all the fences , the free runner , who lives in @entity60 , @entity61 , was considerably over the 11 minute 13 second time limit - taking almost four hours to complete the 6km course			1
mr @entity6 , who is a professional free runner with @entity67 , said : ' i have been free running for almost eight years now , and this was one of the toughest courses i 've run			1
' i got into running when i was at high school because all my friends were doing it , and discovered i was pretty good at it			0
' i have run in all kinds of places , mostly urban , in the past , but my girlfriend suggested i should try some of the @entity4 jumps			0
' mr @entity6 carefully counted the steps he needed for his run - up to each jump to ensure he cleared it mr @entity82 proved two legs were better than four by completing the course mr @entity6 was performing as part of @entity67 , a free running team the @entity87 's granddaughter @entity7 competed at @entity4 on the @entity88 weekend she was forced to retire after her horse @entity47 crashed into a fence flag at the water jump he added : ' on the last day of the competition , the public were free to walk around 28 out of the 30 jumps from the cross country course , so i thought i 'd give it a go			1
' it was a lot more difficult than it looked			0
i had to count out my strides up to each fence , the same way a horse and rider would , to make sure i made it over			0
' the fences are much bigger up close than they appear when you see them on the tv , and i did struggle with a couple of them			0
' my girlfriend still thinks it 's more difficult to get round on a horse - but i 'd disagree			0
' mr @entity6 filmed his four - hour journey around the @entity4 cross country course the free runner cleared all the jumps which are up to 4 ' 9 " high and can be 6 ' 6 " wide see more videos of @entity6 running at www.3run.co.uk .			1
