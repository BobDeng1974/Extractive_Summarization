by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 10 january 2013 while @entity2 is very effective , dr @entity1 says soy , red clover and black cohosh , can also be very effective in relieving menopausal symptoms herbal and complementary medicines are a viable alternative to hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women who fear the possible side effects , according to new research			1
soy for instance , the most common plant containing oestrogen , can reduce hot flushes by more than half , says a scientist who carried out a review into previous studies			0
red clover , a legume also containing the female hormone , and black cohosh , a plant originating in the @entity23 and @entity24 , also ease symptoms			1
women 's primary care specialist dr @entity29 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , who led the review , said : ' up to 75 per cent of women use herbal and complimentary medicines to treat their postmenopausal symptoms			1
' therefore , it is vitally important for healthcare providers to be aware of and informed about the non-pharmacological therapies available for women who are experiencing postmenopausal symptoms and who are looking for an alternative to @entity2			2
' the menopause is associated with an oestrogen deficiency and can cause an increase in hot flushes , vaginal dryness , sexual dysfunction , frequent urinary tract infections , urinary incontinence and joint pain as well as sleep and mood disturbance			0
about two in three postmenopausal women experience hot flushes and a fifth for up to 15 years , writes dr @entity1 in the journal @entity59 ( @entity60 )			2
oestrogen deficiency can also lead to cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and while many drugs are available , a number of non-pharmacological alternatives are sometimes preferred			0
dr @entity1 found @entity2 is the most effective treatment of hot flushes , improving symptoms in 80 to 90 per cent of women			1
oestrogen deficiency after the meonpause can cause sleep and mood disturbance , hot flushes and frequent urinary tract infections , amongst other things but she says there are possible health risks associated with @entity2 such as links to breast cancer , blood clots , stroke and cardiovascular problems			2
dr @entity1 said due to these possible risks , other treatment options may be equally effective such as behaviour modification and herbal and complimentary medicines			2
the review states that as many as 50 to 75 per cent of postmenopausal women use herbal options to treat hot flushes , and of the complimentary therapies , soy , red clover and black cohosh have been the most investigated			1
soy , found naturally in food and supplements , has shown a reduction in hot flush symptoms ranging between 20 to 55 per cent			0
dr @entity1 recommends it , as well as red clover and black cohosh , as there are no significant adverse side effects associated with them , as long as they are used in women with no history of breast cancer , are not at high risk for breast cancer and are not taking tamoxifen			1
but she warns herbal medicines are not regulated in many countries , and therefore the contents of a given product may vary from sample to sample			0
@entity60 's editor in chief @entity119 added : ' postmenopausal symptoms can be very distressing and it is important to review the advantages and limitations of the non pharmacological treatments available as well as the pharmacological ones			0
' even simple behaviour modification can make a difference to postmenopausal symptoms , including keeping the room temperature cool , wearing layered clothing , relaxation techniques and smoking cessation			0

women 's health specialist dr @entity29 agrees @entity2 is very effective at reducing symptoms
@entity136 says many women are concerned about using it
and that red clover , soy and black cohosh may help
