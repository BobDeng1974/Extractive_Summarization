worms were n't always as spineless as you might think			0
in fact , human spines may have evolved from an ancient marine worm , according to new research			2
the study claims that the first vertebrate skeleton ' probably evolved from muscle ' , and its origins are older than first thought			1
the marine worm @entity12 has a muscle ( red ) which develops in the same place and has the same genetic signature as the notochord ( blue ) that develops into our spinal discs humans are part of a group of animals called chordates , whose defining feature is a rod of cartilage that runs lengthwise under the spinal chord			1
this structure , called the notochord , was the first vertebrate skeleton , according to scientists at the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) in @entity32 , @entity33			1
it is present in human embryos , and is replaced with the backbone as we develop , with the cartilage reduced to those tell - tale discs			0
since starfish , sea urchins and related animals have no such structure , scientists assumed the notochord had emerged in a relatively recent ancestor , after our branch of the evolutionary tree split away from the ' starfish branch '			1
scientists found that the larva of the marine worm @entity12 has a group of cells with that same genetic signature as the first ever vertebrate skeleton researchers at @entity56 believe a 505 million - year - old creature , found only in the @entity59 fossil beds in @entity61 â€™s @entity60 , is the most primitive known vertebrate			1
named @entity64 , it is the most primitive member of the chordate family , the group of animals that today includes fish , amphibians , birds , reptiles and mammals			0
@entity64 was first described , on the basis of only a few specimens , by @entity75 palaeontologist @entity74 in 1911			0
averaging about five centimetres in length , @entity64 was a sideways - flattened , somewhat eel - like animal			0
the flattened body is divided into a series of segmented muscle blocks seen as s - shaped lines that lie on either side of the notochord which runs along most , if not all of the body length			2
it likely swam above the sea floor by moving its body in a series of side - to - side curves			0
' people simply have n't been looking beyond our direct relatives , but that means you could be fooled , if the structure appeared earlier and that single group lost it , ' says @entity99 from @entity31 , who led the study			2
' and in fact , when we looked at a broader range of animals , this is what we found			0
' @entity106 and @entity107 identified the genetic signature of the notochord - the combination of genes that have to be turned on for a healthy notochord to form			1
when they found that the larva of the marine worm @entity12 has a group of cells with that same genetic signature , the scientists teamed up with @entity31 to use microscopy to follow those cells as the larva developed			1
they found that the cells form a muscle that runs along the animal 's midline , precisely where the notochord would be if the worm were a chordate			2
the researchers named this muscle the axochord , as it runs along the animal 's axis			0
most of the animal groups that sit between @entity12 and chordates on the evolutionary tree also have a similar , muscle - based structure in the same position			1
human spines may have evolved from an ancient marine worm , according to new @entity143 study claims that the first vertebrate skeleton ' probably evolved from muscle ' , and its origins are older than first thought the scientists reason that such a structure probably first emerged in an ancient ancestor , before all these different animal groups branched out on their separate evolutionary paths			1
such a scenario would also explain why the lancelet amphioxus , a ' primitive ' chordate , has a notochord with both cartilage and muscle			0
rather than having acquired the muscle independently , amphioxus could be a living record of the transition from muscle - based midline to cartilaginous notochord			0
the shift from muscle to cartilage could have come about because a stiffened central rod would make swimming more efficient , the scientists claim .			2

@entity33 study claims the first vertebrate skeleton ' evolved from muscle '
@entity171 made after from genetic signature of first vertebrate skeleton
larva of the worm @entity12 has cells with that same genetic signature
scientists say that such a structure first emerged in an ancient ancestor
