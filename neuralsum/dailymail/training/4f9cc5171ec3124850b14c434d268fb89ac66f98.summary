by @entity1 reporter published : 06:09 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 15:37 est , 7 november 2012 a mother - of - two has revealed how she leaves a trail of skin behind her due to a rare condition that causes her to shed 14 times more skin than normal			1
@entity7 suffers from the rare disorder @entity9			2
in a cruel twist of fate her 21 - month - old daughter @entity10 suffers from the same condition			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , said : ' my skin sheds rapidly , so overnight i can shed the equivalent of what a person with ‘ ordinary ’ skin sheds in two weeks			1
' i 'm covered in scales from head to toe			2
it 's can be so thick to the point that i can barely move , but at the same time it 's so delicate that the slightest knock can break the skin			1
' it can be quite awkward , because you leave a trail of skin behind you			1
a lot of vacuuming goes on in my house			2
' @entity7 and her daughter @entity10 both suffer from a rare disorder that causes them to shed their skin far quicker than normal medics gave @entity7 a 50 per cent chance that her children might be born with @entity42			1
although older sibling @entity45 , three , was born free from the condition , his younger sister was not so lucky			2
mrs @entity7 said : ' as soon as @entity10 was born it was obvious she had it			2
i 'd had an emergency c - section so did n't see her straight away , but i overheard the doctors discuss it and obviously i was devastated			2
' when i first saw her , and how her skin looked i just felt numb			1
it was the last thing i wanted			2
' but i knew that i had to cope and get over it - and who better to raise a child with @entity9 than a fellow sufferer			0
i worry for mums that have n't been through it themselves but @entity10 is already starting to understand her condition , which is great			0
' she 's already rubbing cream into herself , and she notices when she has lose skin			1
she 'll just have to learn her limitations			0
' advancements in medicine mean that doctors are able to recognise @entity9 as soon as possible			0
but when @entity7 first began to suffer from the condition she was not so lucky			0
' when i was born the doctors were totally baffled			0
the top layer of my skin had been stripped off during birth and the doctors had no clue what was going on			1
' my skin was so thick - i could n't bend my knees until i was about three , and i had to wear slippers to school because they were the only shoes that did n't hurt			1
' fortunately , things were different for @entity10			0
' when mrs @entity7 was born ( left and as a child , right ) doctors were baffled by her skin disorder			1
now they can recognise @entity9 quickly close - ups of @entity7 's skin : is it not waterproof and very susceptible to infection the stay - at - home mother must follow a strict care routine to ensure that her and her daughter 's skin is properly hydrated			1
' our skin is very susceptible to infection , so we have to be very clean , but we also have to bathe and shower a lot to get moisture into the skin , ' she said			1
' my daily routine starts with a bath or shower using emollients , which i do twice a day			1
it then takes a minimum of around 30 minutes just for my skin to dry off , then i have to liberally apply creams all over my body			1
' i then have to let the creams soak into my skin for at least a further 20 minutes or so before i can get dressed			1
it takes up to two hours for me to just get ready in the morning and ready for bed at night			1
' i then have to do the same for @entity10			0
' the 34 - year - old says the blisters that come with the @entity9 are the most painful part of the condition			0
' the blisters can appear anywhere and be of any size			0
i once got one from my elbow to my wrist - it was awful			0
' they make getting around very difficult , and antibiotics and dressings are always needed when you get them			0
' during my childhood @entity125 had to burst the blisters herself using sterile needles			0
even now i sometimes have to do the same			0
' @entity7 with her husband @entity129 , son @entity45 and daughter @entity10 : i just want people to know that , even though it 's difficult to live with , you can cope a further bizarre symptom of @entity9 is that the skin is not waterproof			1
' we lack a specific protein , so the the skin absorbs water			1
it leaves the skin white in colour and very soggy			1
' mrs @entity7 now runs the @entity146 website and charity , which has been successful in giving advice and support for fellow sufferers			0
the mother added : ' i just want people to know that , even though it 's difficult to live with , you can cope			1
' ' i never thought i 'd marry or have children with skin like i do , but i have a wonderful husband , @entity129 , 30 , and two beautiful children			2
the skin condition can cause painful blisters ' i am living proof that anything is possible , and there is still so much more i ’ve yet to achieve			2
there are lots of people in this world who are far worse off than myself			0
' @entity9 affects less than 1 in 100,000 people			0
@entity170 , of the @entity171 , said : ' bullous ichthyosis , is a rare form of inherited ichthyosis			0
at birth the baby 's skin seems to be fragile and may show blisters			2
' skin infections are quite common and can lead to a characteristic odour			2
there may be a reduction in sweating in childhood , which improves later in life			0
' it is transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder , which means that one of the parents may be affected			0
however , in at least half of affected children , neither parent is affected ; therefore the child has developed a new gene fault while growing in the womb			0
' @entity7 's friends of @entity9 website can be found at @entity196			0

mother and daughter have @entity42 which causes thickened , flaky skin that is prone to infection
skin care routine takes two hours both at morning and night
