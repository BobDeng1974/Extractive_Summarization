there is no suggestion the substance is a class a drug			0
his left arm is covered with a series of offensive images - including a @entity25 eagle , used by @entity26 during the @entity27 , and two @entity25 planes diving towards a @entity29 , coloured in yellow — the same colour as the badge @entity32 were forced to wear during the @entity34			1

@entity46 wrote on @entity47 in february : ' i rather wonder if we shot one ' poofter ' ( @entity52 whatevers [ sic ] ) , whether the next 99 would decide on balance , that they were n't after - all ? we might then conclude that it 's not a matter of genetics , but rather more a matter of education			1
' mr @entity35 said he had never heard of mr @entity46 and said he would face a ' disciplinary charge '			1
the @entity2 leader also claimed his party was given a rougher ride in the media than the other parties			0
but he was not challenged over the @entity4 shame pictures which emerged on the website @entity66 earlier today			1
mr @entity67 , the candidate at the centre of the row , is standing for @entity2 in @entity12 where the party boasts one councillor			1
the picture - for a limited edition art book , @entity73 - was allegedly taken when he worked as a part - time character model			2
@entity75 attempted to contact mr @entity67 at his email address , which includes the phrase ' stukeboy ' , but he did not reply to our emails			2
the plane on the top of his arm is similar to a @entity86 dive bomber , used by the @entity87 in their invasions of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			2
@entity35 faces a barrage of hostile questions on @entity94 earlier today			0
the @entity2 leader was accused of being a divisive politician playing on people 's antagonism towards foreigners a telephone number for the @entity2 candidate is not publicly listed , but a party source told @entity102 they were ' working on the assumption ' that the man in the picture was mr @entity67			1
but they would only release a statement claiming that they were not a racist party and would be investigating the allegations			0
a former @entity2 supporter , described as a ' rising star ' by @entity35 , quit the party this week - claiming it was pandering to racists a @entity2 spokesman said : ' @entity2 is a non-racist , non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values			2
' where evidence is produced to indicate a breach it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the @entity124 as part of an established disciplinary procedure			0
' mr @entity10 has previously sparked controversy by writing on @entity47 that ‘ there is no such thing as a benign muslim ’			0
he posted the remarks in relation to a story he shared about a @entity136 school at the centre of allegations of a takeover plot by @entity141 hardliners			0
mr @entity67 is standing as a @entity2 candidate in the @entity144 ward in the @entity12 elections on may 22			1

' he also defended a @entity2 candidate who said comedian @entity156 should ‘ emigrate to a black country ’			2
mr @entity10 wrote on the @entity158 ’s @entity47 site : ' @entity156 is the one who raised the issue of racism by his proposition			0
' the repudiation may not be pretty , but does it not have validity ? he wants to set quotas which will do more harm than good			0
he is an opportunist grandstander			0
