it could be bad news for professional race car drivers - a self driving car has beaten one of their ranks for the first time			2
researchers at @entity7 have been working with @entity8 to develop a high speed self driving car			1
the team has designed an @entity11 dubbed ' @entity12 ' which has been programmed to race on its own at speeds above 120 mph at @entity14 in @entity15			1
it its latest test , it was pitted against @entity17 , the racetrack ceo and amateur touring class champion - and was faster by 0.4 of a second			1

@entity12 knows exactly where she is on the road by using a differential gps			1
unlike a standard gps system , hers corrects for interference in the atmosphere , showing the car 's position on the @entity41 with an accuracy of about 2 centimeters			2
@entity12 measures her speed and acceleration with wheel - speed sensors and an accelerometer , and gets her bearings from gyroscopes , which control equilibrium and direction			1
' the typical male response is , it 'll never beat me , ' @entity17 admitted to @entity54			1
the white @entity11 was last year put through its paces on the @entity14 , north of @entity56 , @entity15			1
affectionately named @entity12 is the result of a collaboration between @entity7 's @entity59 , led by mechanical engineering design graduate @entity60 , and the @entity61 the results were revealed during a briefing at the @entity65 's annual meeting in @entity66			1
in a computerized comparison of @entity12 's and @entity17 's performance , @entity17 picked up time on some turns - but @entity12 was able to battle back , beating @entity17 by four - tenths of a second			1
' now to be totally honest and open about this , i can start this competition at a different point on the track , and @entity17 wins by 0.4 seconds , so there is still not a clear victory here , ' @entity60 said			1
' but the point we wanted to make is that we 've gotten fairly comparable to an expert driver in terms of our ability to drive around the track			2
' as the pair race , sensors record variables such as the driver 's body temperature and heart rate			2
scalp electrodes will be used to register the driver 's brain activity as they race against other humans to determine which driving manoeuvres require the most concentration and brainpower			0
however , despite the autonomous car 's sophisticated technology , it still ca n't quite compete with human - driven equivalents			0
as the pair race , sensors record variables such as the driver 's body temperature and heart rate			0
graduate research team leader @entity60 shows off the systems carried onboard the autonomous car , a modified @entity11 despite the loss , @entity17 and his fellow race drivers have built up an instinctive sense about when and how far to push their vehicles			1
' @entity12 does n't have what i call the ' butt sense ' yet , ' @entity17 said			1
' once she does get that butt sense , i 'll be enthralled			0
' ' human drivers are very , very smooth , ' said @entity60			0
@entity12 computes the fastest line around a course and executes the exact corrections required to stick to it			1
a person relies more on feel and intuition , and thus may , for example , allow the car to swing too wide in one turn if he knows it sets him up better for the next			0
' human drivers are ok with the car operating in a comfortable range of states , ' said @entity60			0
' we 're trying to capture some of that spirit			0
' ' we need to know what the best drivers do that makes them so successful , ' said @entity60			0
' if we can pair that with the vehicle dynamics data , we can better use the car 's capabilities			0
' the team believes that the experience and the data they have gained can be used to develop autonomous vehicles for use on public roads			0
@entity12 measures her speed and acceleration with wheel - speed sensors and an accelerometer , and gets her bearings from gyroscopes , which control equilibrium and direction			2
in the nearer term , the technology could be used as an onboard co-pilot that helps the driver steer out of a dangerous situation			0
the reality of racing a car round a track and pushing that vehicle to its absolute limit means that it will be subjected to exceptionally high levels of stress			0
one recent test left @entity12 without any brake pads due to the intense heat generated by friction between the tyres and the pads themselves			2
pushing a car to the limit on the racetrack is one of the best ways to find out what type of stress that car is under in a crisis			0
' if we can figure out how to get @entity12 out of trouble on a race track , we can get out of trouble on ice , ' said @entity60 .			2

@entity8 @entity11 dubbed ' @entity12 ' raced at @entity14 in @entity15
raced against @entity17 , amateur touring class champion
@entity12 was found to be faster by 0.4 of a second
