a @entity2 @entity1 hero who was awarded a medal for his skill and bravery may be laid to rest at a funeral with no mourners			1
@entity8 , 90 , passed away at his home in @entity10 two weeks ago and had no children with his late wife @entity12 , who died 18 months previously			1
@entity8 , a mid-upper gunner , was awarded the @entity13 for shooting down five @entity15 enemy fighters when he was attacked while on a mission over @entity17			1
@entity8 ( pictured with wife @entity12 who died 18 months before him ) passed away at his home aged 90 and may now be buried at a funeral with no mourners as he did not have children as a mid-gunner for the @entity1 he was awarded the @entity13 for shooting down @entity25 fighters			1
he also piloted a @entity27 bomber and was instrumental in the raid that sunk the @entity29 the veteran was also instrumental in the attack which sank @entity32 , a 42,900 ton @entity33 built for @entity35 's @entity34 , on november 12 , 1944			1
he completed a remarkable 28 sorties piloting a @entity27 in the @entity1 's @entity37			2
after the war he became a warrant officer and settled down with his wife in @entity41 in @entity42			2
@entity43 , of @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46 , has pleaded for mourners to attend mr @entity8 's funeral service on july 4			1
mr @entity43 said : ' we 've got so much to be thankful for to guys like these			2
' i remember hiding under the kitchen table with my mother and at the same time he was probably flying off to fight the @entity25			0
@entity55 @entity43 is now appealing for people to come forward to attend mr @entity8 's funeral ' it 's amazing really			1
i first met him 18 months ago when his wife died and he was absolutely devastated			1
' he was a very unassuming sort of man , so when i heard the stories about his time during the war i could n't believe it			0
these guys were so brave			0
' mr @entity8 has eight siblings but , apart from one brother , they are all too elderly to attend the service			1
mr @entity43 added : ' he 's got no - one to fight his corner really			0
he was quite a private person			0
' the @entity29 was one of only two @entity70 - class @entity35 battleships			2
it had double armour plating , eight 15inch guns and carried nearly 2,000 officers and crew the @entity29 was one of only two @entity70 - class battleships built for the @entity77 - or navy - during the @entity2			1
the vast vessel weighed 42,900 tons , was double - plated with armour , carried nearly 2,000 officers and crew and was heavily armed with eight 15 - inch cannons , flak guns and machine guns			0
it spent most of the war in @entity87 waters , harrying shipping convoys on their way to @entity90 and forcing the @entity91 to station a large naval force there to defend against it			0
the @entity95 dared not risk a sea attack on the @entity29 , as it was so heavily armed , so instead focused on destroying it from the air			1
bombing raids while it was being built in 1941 failed to destroy it , and early attacks after it was completed were largely unsuccessful due to the thickness of its armour plating			0
it was n't until 1944 that the @entity1 managed to cripple the craft after inventor sir @entity109 - who also designed the bouncing bomb - created the 12,030lb @entity111 , capable of penetrating the ship 's defences			2
on september 15 , 1944 , 27 @entity27 bombers from @entity1 9th and 617th squadrons took off from a base in @entity90 to attack the @entity29 at anchor in @entity119 in @entity120			1
one @entity111 found its target in the @entity29 's forecastle , exploding deep within the battleship			2
the explosion was so powerful it knocked out the ship 's engines , but the vessel failed to sink			0
instead it was moved to southern @entity120 where it was stationed as a semi-static heavy artillery battery after @entity35 high command decided they could n't restore it to full strength			0
another raid on october 29th failed as cloud blew over the ship just as the bombers were approaching , blocking it from view , meaning all the bombs missed			0
the @entity1 eventually sunk the @entity29 on november 12 after hitting it with two @entity143 - huge 12,030lb bombs made specially for the mission by the same man who designed the bouncing bomb the @entity29 was finally sunk on november 12 when bombers from 9th and 617th squadron attacked it again , flying in low so as not to appear on radar			1
despite warnings being sent from the ship to a nearby airfield , not a single @entity25 fighter took off to attack the bombers when they were finally spotted			2
the ship 's flak guns could only do so much to defend her , and two @entity143 hit the deck , resulting in a huge explosion which caused the ship to list			0
eventually ammunition stored below deck also exploded , causing the ship to turn to port and capsize			0
within 10 minutes the vessel was completely upside down			0
the attack killed roughly 1,000 of her crew , but thanks to the inaction of @entity25 pilots the @entity1 lost none of its bombers which all returned safely to base - including the one carrying @entity8 .			1
