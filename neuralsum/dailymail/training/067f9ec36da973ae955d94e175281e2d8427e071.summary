by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 11 march 2013 @entity1 are preparing to vote on a blanket ban on pornography - which includes censorship of the internet - throughout the @entity7 's 27 member states			1
but research scientist and writer dr @entity8 – who found fame under her pen name @entity12 – says outlawing erotic entertainment sites and publications will not , as is intended , promote gender equality , and could do more harm than good			1
the @entity7 's @entity17 proposed the ban , which is being voted on tomorrow			2
but , writing in her @entity21 blog , dr @entity8 says such measures are not only futile , they are also fundamentally ' wrong '			1
dr @entity8 , left , with actress @entity23 , right , who played the character of @entity8 in the @entity26 dramatisation arguing that the proposal is based upon the misinformed assumption that all pornography is violent and misogynistic , dr @entity8 says : ' @entity30 is not the cause of gender stereotypes ; eliminating it will not end them			1
' banning access to porn in @entity36 obviously wo n't do anything to make women more equal to men there			2
@entity42 adult entertainment does not eliminate sexual crime , as @entity44 surely should know , with its epidemic of sex crimes despite bans on strip clubs and prostitution			0
' so why does anyone think such measures would have an effect in the @entity7 ? ’ dr @entity8 funded her doctoral studies between 2003 and 2004 working as a @entity54 call girl , then published her diaries in the anonymous blog @entity8 : diary of a @entity54 call girl			1
her blog was dramatised by @entity26 under the title @entity61 in 2007 , with actress @entity23 playing the title role			2
dr @entity8 revealed her true identity in 2009			2
@entity1 will vote tomorrow on whether there should be a blanket ban on pornography across the 27 member states one of the @entity8 books , dramatised from dr @entity8 's blog , left , and @entity70 in the @entity26 series , right in her @entity21 blog dr @entity8 opines that although the @entity1 vote will not be a legislative measure , it will pave the way for legislation to come			1
she complains that one of the main problems is that the definition of pornography is fuzzy , different to everyone , and as such could potentially , to some people , include topless pro-feminist demonstrations by groups such as the @entity87 's @entity86 , or raunchy self - portraits texted between partners			0
banning all such electronic communications would be , she says , completely impossible			0
will @entity1 vote to ban pornography within the @entity7 ? she continues : ‘ but , enough about the logistics of it - this is wrong			1
as per ever , the focus of the panic is mainstream , heterosexual porn being viewed only by men			0
‘ yet again the assumption is that all men are easily programmed , woman - hating abusers , and all women are meek sub-adults who must be protected from the clutches of sexy , sexy evil			0
' in this worldview , gay people , mutual consent , and women 's sexual agency conveniently do not exist			0
' if you think this represents all or even most of pornography then you need to get out more			0
where by " out " i mean " the internet "			0

@entity1 will vote on pornography ban within 27 @entity7 member states tomorrow
dr @entity8 wrote @entity8 blog about working as a call girl
says proposed ban is based on assumption that all porn is violent
