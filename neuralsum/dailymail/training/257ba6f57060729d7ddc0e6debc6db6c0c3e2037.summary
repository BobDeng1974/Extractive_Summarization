shafted : @entity15 was denied a $ 1,000 tip because the customer who left it used a credit card on @entity25 , @entity15 was working the graveyard shift at a @entity4 in @entity26 when a customer left her with a shocking surprise			1
' he said , " i ’m going to bless you today , ' " @entity15 told @entity31 on tuesday			0
' he was just trying to show that there are still good people out there			0
' it was about 3:30 a.m. when the man - who has chosen to not identify himself - left @entity15 a $ 1,500 tip on his credit card , with $ 1,000 of it to go to @entity15 and the other $ 500 to go to a ' haggard - looking woman ' at a nearby table , according to the @entity42			1
however , the @entity4 manager refused to give @entity15 the cash , citing a restaurant policy against servers receiving large tips made on a credit card - according to the restaurant , the rule is in place in case a customer later disputes the charge			1
policy : the manger at the @entity4 where @entity15 works ( pictured ) told her he could n't give her the money because of a restaurant policy about tipping with credit cards ' when a guest makes a tip of this size , it is our procedure to refund the tip amount and ask the guest to make the tip in either cash or a check , ' the chain said in a statement to @entity31			1
@entity15 , however , had no way of getting touch with the customer to ask if he would cut her a check - so the unidentified man 's generous tip would go unclaimed			0
' a lot of servers wait for that day when you get a tip like that , and when i did n’t get it , it was very humiliating and heartbreaking , ' she said			0
@entity15 began calling local media outlets to tell them about the tip she lost , and @entity89 columnist @entity88 tracked him down			0
the unidentified man who left @entity15 the tip was tracked down several weeks later and wrote her a personal check to make up for the money she was denied by her employer @entity15 's benefactor , a local businessman who owns several restaurants in the area , was told how she never received the money he had intended on giving her and wrote her a personal check			2
@entity15 says she thinks the man left her such a large tip because he 's in the restaurant industry and understands how hard she works - and how well she treats her customers			1
' i try to make them feel as comfortable as possible , ' @entity15 said			0
' he knows good service when he sees it			0
