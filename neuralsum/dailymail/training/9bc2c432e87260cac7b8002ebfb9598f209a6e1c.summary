as a consequence , backyard and professional breeding do not exist to the same extent that they do in the @entity57			0
the ingenious idea of unwanted @entity57 dogs emigrating to @entity4 started when one dog lover from @entity61 visited the vegas shelter and said that she wanted to help save the lives of as many of these poor , unwanted animals as she could			2

while the financial situation in the @entity57 may have improved since the dark days of 2008 , @entity2 continues to have the second largest number of foreclosures in the @entity57 and @entity11 continues to send a steady steam of unwanted pets to start new lives in @entity4			2

foreclosed upon @entity156 has flown more than 1,000 dogs to @entity4 in the past two and half years
the pet charity was started by @entity2 - native @entity10 after he discovered the city had a huge amount of unwanted animals
many dogs were left behind by owners who foreclosed on their homes
in @entity4 stricter rules require owners to spay and neuter their pets *meaning* there is a shortage of dogs , especially smaller breeds
@entity71 , a three - year - old male @entity75 mix , became the 1,000th dog sent north of the border and has *quickly* been adopted by his new family
