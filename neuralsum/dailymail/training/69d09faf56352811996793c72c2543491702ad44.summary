there will come a time , in a 100 years from now , when @entity2 supporters will cast their eyes over @entity5 ’s records and wonder what all the fuss was about			1
injury - permitting the @entity2 forward is on course to break @entity11 ’s record of 125 caps some time in 2017 ( at the very latest )			1
in the new year , when @entity2 ’s head coach @entity13 picks up again , @entity5 will pass sir @entity15 ’s goalscoring record before we are done with 2015			1
@entity29 , unlike @entity5 , has previously refused to play for @entity33 over a disciplinary issue and also retired , briefly , from international football in october 2009			2
it did him no harm			0
@entity5 ’s record of 46 goals in 101 international appearances is similar to the @entity42 forward and yet our country remains divided about his contribution to the @entity48 game			1
his performance in @entity20 , where he scored twice in a 3 - 1 victory over @entity52 ’s team at @entity53 , was masterful			1
there is a maturity about his game			0
at 29 , with the captain ’s armband strapped to his left bicep , he has taken it upon himself to draw the best out of @entity2 ’s emerging young players			2
@entity5 nods in the first of his double against @entity20 to move into third on @entity2 's all - time scorers chart the @entity2 captain sweeps in his second of the night and his side 's third to seal victory ‘ sometimes results do n’t go the way we want them to and people see it as if we do n’t want to play four the country , but that ’s far from the truth , ’ he claimed			1
‘ we love coming to @entity20 , we love playing for @entity2			1
you have seen what it means to us and we are like that in every game			0
’ @entity5 has had his moments , but if we are to make comparisons then @entity85 has a rap sheet , all documented in his brilliant autobiography i am @entity29 , that puts the @entity2 forward to shame			2
he has never scored a goal at a @entity91 , either , but @entity29 ’s acolytes always gloss over that because @entity33 is @entity33 , right ? @entity5 operates under different pressures with @entity2 and his detractors will always reference his disappointing record ( one goal , in a 2 - 1 defeat against @entity98 in @entity99 at the @entity100 ) on the biggest stage of all			1
@entity5 runs away in celebration as he prepares to launch himself into a cartwheel the forward can not hide his delight as he wheels away in front of the travelling @entity2 support @entity5 became @entity2 's youngest ever player when coming on in a 3 - 1 loss to @entity112 in 2003 if bringing home the @entity115 from a @entity91 really is the be-all - and - end - all about a player ’s place in the game ’s @entity119 , then we are duty bound to look back at the last few tournaments			1
since @entity5 was born in @entity124 in 1985 there is only one striker in the game who has won as many league titles as @entity5 during his career			0
that man was @entity131 with @entity132 ( 5 )			0
whether or not you like @entity5 , respect him or otherwise , there are few @entity115 winners who have done it consistently for club and country since they made their international debuts			2
the much - admired @entity139 , who scored six times during @entity2 ’s run to the @entity91 quarter - final at @entity143 , never won a league title			1
after scoring 48 times for @entity2 , he enjoys legendary status			0
@entity5 acknowledges the crowd before @entity2 's @entity149 qualifier against @entity150 , his 100th cap @entity5 is edging closer to the @entity2 record of @entity15 ( left ) , here scoring against @entity153 in 1966 at @entity155 we fell in love with the @entity158 forward @entity157			1
he scored five at the tournament but never won a league title			0
@entity162 forward @entity161 , who scored six at the 1994 @entity91 in the @entity163 , won a league title with @entity165			0
@entity166 , leading scorer at the @entity167 , won one league title with @entity169			0
the @entity171 ronaldo , who scored eight in 2002 , won just one league title in @entity173 , with @entity169			0
@entity174 , who scored five for @entity175 at the 2006 @entity91 , won two league titles with @entity177			2
injury permitting , @entity5 is on course to beat @entity11 's 125 - cap record for @entity2 @entity5 's career has not always been simple , but he has five @entity184 titles with @entity185 @entity186 was top scorer at @entity155 , yet he never won a title @entity188 , top scorer in @entity189 , has three @entity191 titles with @entity177 and will win countless more			1
@entity192 ( @entity171 2014 ) won three league titles with @entity194			0
some of the other issues , judging by the consistent reaction to @entity5 on social media , is that the forward happens to play his club football with @entity185			0
it is there that @entity5 has scored 219 goals in 450 appearances for since joining @entity185 just weeks after he announced himself to international football at @entity206			1
@entity139 nets the second of his three goals against @entity209 - he was top scorer at the 1986 @entity91 @entity131 ( left ) joined @entity161 , who hit five goals against @entity211 , as top scorer in 1994 @entity166 scores one of his six goals in the @entity167 during the semi-final against @entity215 he is third on the list of all - time leading scorers , just 18 behind @entity218 and 30 short of equalling sir @entity15			2
‘ i ca n’t speak for him but if you ask me the records should be very important , ’ claimed @entity13 after @entity2 had recorded their sixth successive victory in @entity20			2
‘ it must be nice for him to think he ’ll see his name at the top of the list and a record number of caps is in sight too			0
’ after more than ten years at the top for club and country , it is time @entity5 is given the credit he deserves			0
@entity175 legend @entity174 is the top @entity91 goalscorer ever with 16 goals before the tournament in @entity171 , @entity238 was the @entity91 's top scorer - he hit 62 goals in total for @entity171 @entity5 scored his one and only @entity91 goal in the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity98 in @entity99 in the summer but , not for the first time , the tournament ended in dejection for both the @entity185 man and @entity2 @entity248 praises attack as @entity5 approaches record			1

@entity5 scored twice in @entity2 's 3 - 1 win vs @entity20 on tuesday
@entity5 's international record reads : 46 goals in 101 caps
the 29 - year - old has scored once at a @entity91 - vs @entity98 in summer
@entity5 's club record *outshines* his international *achievements* - *including* five @entity184 titles and one @entity265 medal
