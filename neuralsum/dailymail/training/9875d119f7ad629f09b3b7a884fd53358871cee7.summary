by @entity0 last updated at 2:35 pm on 11th november 2011 two former @entity2 executives have hit back at their ' disingenuous ' former boss @entity3 as a bitter war of words engulfs the media empire			1
the paper 's former editor @entity7 and ex-legal manager @entity9 claim that they made mr @entity3 aware of widespread hacking within the organisation as long ago as 2008			1
but mr @entity3 told @entity12 yesterday he ' disputed vigorously ' the claims from mr @entity7 and mr @entity9 that they revealed the significance of an email indicating the practice was widespread			1
the meeting in june 2008 centres on the ' for @entity20 ' email which contained transcripts of hacked messages from the mobile phone of @entity24 , chief executive of the @entity25			2
this email was apparently intended for chief reporter @entity27			0
coming out fighting : former @entity2 editor @entity7 , left , and @entity9 , former legal manager of @entity29 say @entity3 was told in 2008 about widespread hacking denials : @entity31 executive @entity3 protests his innocence to mps during a second round of questioning in front of the @entity37 yesterday had mr @entity3 been fully briefed about the contents of the message it would have been clear to him that hacking was not limited to the single ' rogue ' reporter , @entity42 , who was jailed in 2007			1
mr @entity7 and mr @entity9 say he knew about the contents of the email			2
mr @entity3 says he did not			2
after the meeting , a payment of £ 425,000 was made to mr @entity24 in return for a confidentiality agreement that prevents him from discussing the matter			1
it is not known how such a significant payment could have been made without the full reasons being known by those at the top of the organisations			0
@entity55 was later told in july 2009 that hacking was restricted to a single reporter			0
mr @entity3 has repeatedly insisted to @entity12 that he had no knowledge of hacking			1
the bitter row erupted yesterday after mr @entity3 's bruising second appearance before the @entity62 's inquiry into the scandal			2
the ' for @entity20 ' email and the payment to @entity24 were two of the main lines of questioning that mps used to interrogate mr @entity3			1
mr @entity3 insisted he had not learned until recently that the practice of illegally eavesdropping on private phone messages was widely used at the newspaper			2
the evidence given to the committee by mr @entity9 and mr @entity7 in september was ' inconsistent and not right ' , he said , adding : ' i believe their testimony was misleading and i dispute it			2
' committee chairman @entity78 said it was clear that of the two accounts @entity12 had heard about the june 2008 meeting to discuss settling a legal claim brought by @entity25 chief executive @entity24 ' one of them can not be true '			1
mr @entity3 admitted that he was made aware by mr @entity9 and mr @entity7 at that meeting of the existence of the ' for @entity20 ' email			1
but he insisted he was not shown it or told its full contents or significance			0
mr @entity93 told the hearing that he had spoken to mr @entity27 , who claimed he was told by mr @entity9 that he had shown the email to mr @entity3			1
mr @entity9 and mr @entity7 had told mps the email was the sole reason for deciding to pay mr @entity24 an out of court payment of £ 425,000 , because it fatally undermined the ' single rogue reporter ' theory			1
they say the @entity29 boss was fully aware of this , suggesting his denials to @entity12 were misleading			0
however , asked by @entity106 mp @entity93 whether he had misled the committee in his previous evidence , mr @entity3 said : ' no , i did not			1
' mr @entity3 admitted he was made aware of the existence of the ' for @entity20 ' email but said he was not shown it , nor told of its full contents by mr @entity9 or mr @entity7 when they discussed settling mr @entity24 's case at the june 10 meeting			1
@entity106 mp @entity93 , left , has called for football boss @entity24 , chief executive of the @entity25 , to come clean over his £ 425,000 out - of - court hacking settlement it was a short meeting , said mr @entity3 , where he was given ' sufficient information to authorise the increase of the settlement offer that had been made			1
but i was given no more than that			0
' he said the email ' was mentioned to me as evidence that was important with respect of it being a transcript of a voicemail interception that came through , that proved it was on behalf of the @entity2 '			0
he added : ' it was not shown to me , nor was it discussed with me its other features – that it was ' for @entity20 , ' and that it might indicate wider - spread knowledge or wider - spread activities of phone - hacking			0
' the two former executives fought back against mr @entity3 's suggestions that they had misled @entity55			2
mr @entity7 and mr @entity9 both issued statements last night standing by their original evidence to @entity55 that their media boss knew the practice went beyond a single ' rogue reporter '			1
' for @entity20 ' : the controversial email was destined for the paper 's former chief reporter @entity27 in a statement later , mr @entity9 said he ' can perfectly understand ' why mr @entity3 ' felt the need to discredit ' the two men but found it ' regrettable '			1
' the simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning email and what it meant in terms of wider @entity2 involvement , ' he added			0
' at best , his evidence on this matter was disingenuous			0
' mr @entity7 said he had ' every confidence ' the police would establish the truth adding : ' my evidence to the @entity166 has been entirely accurate and consistent			2
i stand by my account of the meeting with @entity3 on 10 june 2008			0
' the now - defunct newspaper 's chief reporter @entity27 said he had compiled his own secret dossier - partly held by the police - that he believed would be ' good news ' for the beleaguered mr @entity3			2
but mr @entity27 said last night his dossier would be ' good news ' because it would back up mr @entity3 's claim that he has been ' seriously misled by senior executives on the @entity2 '			2
' but it will be bad news in the sense it will prove my case for unfair dismissal and will certainly cost @entity29 the redundancy money which they owe me , ' he added			0
@entity106 mp @entity183 said mr @entity3 ’s credibility as chairman of parent company @entity29 had been shattered by his claim that he was kept in the dark and failed to establish what happened			1
mr @entity183 said mr @entity3 , the son of @entity31 chief @entity189 , should stand down			1
he said : ' i do n’t think anyone really thinks he was telling the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth			0
his defence was that he is incompetent — because he never bothered to ask the questions that a 12 - year - old would have asked			0
' if i was a shareholder in @entity198 or @entity31 , i would say , ‘ you have allowed your company to corrupt the @entity201 , to lie to @entity55 , and to hack the best part of 6,000 people : it ’s time you went ’			0
' the @entity106 mp and shadow justice minister said a director of a construction company would be held personally liable for any injuries and that being ignorant was no excuse			0
the @entity211 newspaper , part of the @entity31 , today used a leading article to admit that the company mishandled the crisis by putting private investigators onto its critics			0
it said : ' this was disgraceful			0
instead of listening and responding to those asking legitimate questions , the company instead pursued its critics as enemies			0

@entity7 and @entity9 say that @entity3 was told in 2008 about widespread hacking
mr @entity3 subsequently made £ 425,000 payout to hacking *victim* @entity24
but the media boss repeatedly told @entity12 that he had no knowledge of hacking
even committee chairman @entity78 says ' one of them is not telling the truth '
mp @entity183 calls for mr @entity3 to resign
