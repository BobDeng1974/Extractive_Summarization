@entity2 's comment was aimed at the @entity15 as the broadcaster came under fire for its round - the - clock coverage of the liberation hero 's passing while storms batter @entity24 's @entity23 coast			1
he wrote on his @entity3 blog : ' for @entity27 ’s sake @entity15 , give it a bloody break for five minutes , will you ? ' it ’s as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self - flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt ; look ! famous nice black man dies ! let ’s re-run the entire history of @entity36			1
' that ’s better than watching the country we ’re in being flattened by a storm			2
' the former editor of @entity43 's today programme added : ' look ; i 'm sorry @entity7 is dead			2
' it happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill , even famous people , but i 'm sure that does n't lessen the sadness for many of us			0
i never met the man but , on balance , i came to the conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill. ' i think i came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion 20 years ago , or maybe 15			0
so , i 'm sorry he 's dead , i wish it were otherwise			0
' the remarks were met with widespread opprobrium on @entity62			1
@entity63 took to the social messaging service to describe @entity2 's blog post as ' really just like a maggot ... trying to describe a butterfly			1
' @entity68 added : ' go home , @entity2 , you 're an idiot			2
' elsewhere on the microblogging site , users described @entity2 as ' odious ' , ' vile ' , ' sick ' , ' offensive ' and ' a pointless , unremarkable human '			1
@entity75 , director of the @entity75 , used @entity62 to publish a ' @entity2 decision tree ' , which described him as an ' attention seeking wind up merchant '			1
however , @entity2 was not the only person to question the outpouring of coverage of @entity7 's death on the @entity15 while parts of @entity24 are drowning beneath the worst tidal surges for six decades			1
olympic gold medallist @entity86 was also blasted on @entity62 for criticising tv coverage surrounding the death - slamming the ' gargantuan montage ' of the iconic leader being played on the news			1
the long jumper was tweeting about @entity94 show ' what happens in @entity96 ' at 10pm last night when news broke that the legendary @entity36 leader had died			0
but responding to messages from some of his 138,242 followers telling him to watch the news , the 27 - year - old launched a scathing attack on widespread coverage of @entity7 's death			2
remarkably , the ginger - haired @entity106 - who won gold at @entity109 - even slammed fellow celebrities for jumping on ' the band wagon ' by tweeting rip messages			2
@entity86 tweeted : ' people , please stop telling me to put the news on			2
i am aware @entity7 's dead , i do n't need a gargantuan montage to remind me			0
' he then added : ' getting an onslaught of abuse because i do n't want to watch the news ? good lord it 's tragic @entity7 is dead i know			0
' but i refuse to jump on the band wagon and join the rip tweeting			0
i 've read news reports & that 's enough for me thank you			0
' ' i just wanted to watch something else ... ' @entity24 olympic gold medallist @entity86 was also condemned on @entity62 after he complained about the wall - to - wall coverage on tv of @entity7 's death last night hundreds of @entity62 users blasted @entity86 for ' lacking respect ' for not paying tribute to the iconic leader			1
@ @entity138 tweeted : ' how insensitive			0
. lost all respect for you after that ! go take a running jump ... ' and @ @entity143 added : ' your lack of respect for the demise of a man who is held in the highest regards is shameful			0
' another @entity62 user , @ @entity150 , said : ' i ca n't believe how rude he is tbh ! # norespectwhatsoever ' defending himself after the barrage of abuse , @entity86 then tweeted : ' there is no disrespect			1
