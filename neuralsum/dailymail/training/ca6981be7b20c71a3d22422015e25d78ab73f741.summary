escaped : @entity0 fled @entity1 after the country was devastated by famine a young woman who fled @entity1 has revealed the horrific details of her upbringing in the pariah state , where she first saw someone executed when she was just seven - years - old			1
@entity0 was brainwashed to believe that the country , run by the murderous @entity11 regime , was the greatest in the world			1
but when her eyes were opened to the desperate poverty and repression all around her , she knew she had to escape , and is now devoted to raising global awareness of her fellow countrymen 's plight			2
ms @entity0 spoke about her ordeal in a lecture at the @entity23 conference in @entity24 , @entity25 , published by @entity26			0
she told how she grew up convinced that @entity1 was the best place to live as she sang patriotic songs with titles such as ' @entity30 '			2
' when i was seven - years - old , i saw my first public execution - but i thought my life in @entity1 was normal , ' she said			2
it was not until 1995 , during the first of a series of devastating famines to grip the country , that she first realised how serious was the plight of many @entity1			0
her mother received a heart - wrenching letter from the sister of a colleague , and read it out to ms @entity0			0
' when you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we have n't eaten for the past two weeks , ' the letter read			0
' we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die			0
' nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families , ' ms @entity0 said			0
she decided to take the extreme risk of escaping across the @entity76 which divides @entity1 from @entity61			1
at the time , only a few dozen @entity1 fled the country each year - though enough tried and failed that dead bodies could often been seen floating down the river after failed escape attempts			2
crossing : the narrow stretch of river which forms the border between the two countries ms @entity0 successfully crossed the border , leaving her family behind - but she was not yet out of danger entirely			2
because @entity61 is @entity1 's closest ally , it refuses to recognise the refugee status of those who flee the country , instead classifying them as illegal immigrants			1
if ms @entity0 had been caught by the @entity61 authorities , she would have been returned to her home country and probably imprisoned or even executed			1
she spent a decade hiding her true identity in @entity61 - although the police once interrogated her on suspicion of secretly being @entity1 , her @entity61 was good enough to fool them			1
hermit state : this image from ms @entity0 's talk shows how @entity1 is bereft of electricity the defector then moved on to @entity104 , arriving in 2008 and receiving a new apartment and college education			1
however , although @entity104 generally welcomes refugees from the @entity1 , ms @entity0 's decision was not without risk as the authorities in her home country have been known to inflict harsh punishments on those who have relatives in the @entity104			1
so when @entity1 officials intercepted money she had sent to her family , ms @entity0 knew she would have to move quickly to save them from a grisly fate			1
she daringly returned to the @entity1 , and escorted them on a 2,000 - mile bus journey through @entity61 to the @entity121 state of @entity122			1
dictator : @entity124 is the latest member of his dynasty to repress the country 's citizens when the vehicle was stopped by a @entity61 policeman , ms @entity0 feared the worst , but managed to rescue her relatives from the danger			1
' as the @entity61 officer approached my family , i impulsively stood up , and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning , ' she said			0
' he looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me			0
' the family reached @entity122 , but the vulnerable immigrants were placed in jail by corrupt officials and ms @entity143 could not afford to pay the bribes which would ensure their release			0
an @entity147 backpacker saw her weeping on the street , and after asking what was wrong went to an @entity151 to withdraw the money she needed			0
when she asked why he was helping her , he replied : ' i 'm not helping you - i 'm helping the @entity1 people			0
' ms @entity0 is now campaigning for more international support for @entity1 defectors and their families in order to help reintegrate the hermit nation with the rest of the world			2
over the past five years , an average of 2,400 people have fled the country annually .			0

@entity0 grew up devoted to @entity1 and its @entity11 regime

risked her life for a decade as refugee in @entity61 but made it to @entity104
returned to the @entity1 to *smuggle* her relatives out of the pariah state
