by @entity0 @entity2 owner @entity1 last night angrily branded @entity4 ’s decision to hand @entity5 a passage to the @entity7 play - off round a sporting scandal			1
and in an interview with @entity14 , the majority shareholder of the @entity12 champions further claimed his club would have handed the tie to @entity5 had the disciplinary shoe been on the other foot			1
a multi-millionaire investor and businessman in @entity21 , @entity1 spoke out after @entity4 upheld a decision to punish @entity2 for fielding the suspended @entity23 as a substitute for the last four minutes of their 2 - 0 win over @entity5 in @entity27			1
‘ i think this is a scandal because i do n’t know a court in a democratic country anywhere where the penalty would be so grossly disproportionate to the crime , ’ @entity1 told @entity14			1
‘ i can not believe there is another organisation like @entity4 which stands so far outside of the principles of justice anywhere in @entity54 or the democratic world			1
‘ let ’s admit that and change this crazy rule			2
it is a scandal because it is such a flagrant instance of going against the spirit of the game			0
’ verdict : @entity2 are out of the @entity7 as they fielded an ineligible player handed a three - match ban for a red card in the @entity40 last season , @entity63 sat out two qualifiers against @entity69 ’s @entity68 and the first leg 4 - 1 win over @entity5 in @entity21			1
but , in a critical error , @entity2 administrator @entity72 failed to register the defender in the squad to face @entity76 ’s – meaning the first two games of his ban were never properly recognised			1
‘ if our player had not served his three - game suspension and played against @entity76 ’s or in the first game with @entity5 it would have been different , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ but we left a space open in our squad for those games – we did n’t put anyone else in our squad instead			0
‘ we were saying : “ this player is suspended , we have left him out			2
” manager : @entity36 's side won 6 - 1 over the two legs , but @entity5 will progress to the next round ‘ it was clear we complied with the spirit of the law			1
but because of a small technicality and interpretation of the rule , we suffer			0
‘ everybody says it ’s clear , rules are rules			0
but we showed in our appeal that it is confusing			0
because of that , the penalty is gross			0
‘ i am appealing to @entity4 to rethink this rule because it is simply not fair			1
’ at a press conference last sunday , @entity1 angered @entity5 by applying emotional blackmail on the @entity109 club to forfeit the tie			1
when that failed , @entity2 put their case at a @entity4 appeal hearing on wednesday morning in @entity34			1
shock : @entity29 's @entity5 were poor in both legs , and deserved to go out based on their performances @entity1 has vowed to pursue the matter all the way to the @entity118 , with @entity118 secretary general @entity119 confirming yesterday that @entity2 could take advantage of a fast - track process before the @entity7 play - off first leg against @entity123 next wednesday			1
with @entity5 already preparing for a flight to @entity128 , however , a statement from the @entity126 champions read last night : ‘ we have been advised by @entity4 of the decision of the @entity130 to dismiss an appeal by @entity2			1
we understand that @entity2 may appeal that decision to @entity118			1
‘ for our part we can only proceed on the basis of @entity4 ’s decisions and the fixtures announced by them and , therefore , we must now prepare for our match against @entity123 next week			2
’ persistently critical of @entity5 ’s willingness to take advantage of a lifeline worth a potential £ 15million in revenue , @entity1 claimed @entity2 would have reached the opposite decision had the roles been reversed			1
outplayed : the @entity12 side won 4 - 1 in the home leg , and 2 - 0 in @entity126 ‘ we have asked ourselves many times how we would react if @entity5 had played a suspended player			1
‘ in our heads and in our conversations we came to the same conclusion			0
we would have given the tie to @entity5			1
‘ we have very specific fans here			0
for them the issue of honour is incredibly important			0
‘ our fans would not accept it if we took advantage of a situation like this as @entity5 have			2
‘ of course there would be a number who would say we were stupid giving up a place in the @entity7 and all that money			2
‘ but in the end , taking into account our history and the values we want to be known for as a club , i think we would make a decision to not take advantage			2
‘ who knows ? it would have been a very difficult decision , but i think we would have been on the right side of the situation			2
’ meanwhile , @entity29 says @entity5 are fully prepared for their tie with @entity123 – despite days of uncertainty over their fate			1
future : @entity5 will now face @entity123 over two legs as they look to reach the @entity7 group stages he had no idea until yesterday lunchtime if his side were heading for @entity128 or @entity39 in the @entity40 but proceeding on the basis they would play @entity123 , he said : ‘ we have had them watched			1
‘ we have full reports on them			0
they are a good team , well organised			0
they are compact and good on the counter attack			0
they have some good players as well			0
‘ they have won their league three years in a row but you always meet good teams in the @entity7			2
’ asked if the @entity128 champions – conquerors in recent years of @entity200 and @entity201 – were better than @entity2 , @entity29 shrugged			2
‘ it ’s hard to say			0
i have n’t watched them myself in person , but i think it ’s pretty close			0
‘ we have to step up a level in our performances - that ’s the most important thing			2
‘ but we are now two or three weeks further on			0
we have played one domestic game and are back at @entity109			0
‘ we have got players in also and i am looking forward to the games			0
‘ i ’m just happy we are getting fixtures now , real matches you can learn from			0
‘ you give feedback to the players and work from there			0
and that ’s why i ’m looking forward , first , to the game on saturday against @entity221			0
