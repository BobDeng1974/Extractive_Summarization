the @entity0 have no right to boo @entity3 international @entity2 on friday night , according to his former @entity5 team - mate @entity4			1
@entity2 will return to the land of his birth with @entity9 's squad this week as they take on @entity11 in a crucial @entity13 qualifier at @entity14			1
the @entity16 clash could pit @entity2 against former @entity5 colleague @entity17 - and spark an emotional tug - of - war in the corridors at @entity20 where the midfield duo were both given their footballing education			1
@entity2 ( centre ) was born and raised in @entity11 but chose to play for the @entity3 @entity2 has flourished in central midfield at @entity26 since following @entity27 to the club from @entity29 @entity5 player - manager @entity4 hopes the @entity11 supporters show @entity2 respect at @entity14 @entity5 player - manager @entity4 says he will be backing @entity11 's @entity17 to come out on top in the next leg of the race to @entity36			1
but he has shot down any suggestion that the home support will have the right to shower @entity26 's 23 - year - old @entity2 with stick			1
like @entity42 team - mate and former @entity44 star @entity43 , @entity2 turned his back on the @entity46 to pledge his international future to the @entity3 @entity48 hopes @entity2 and @entity43 are given a ' horrible reception ' when they take on @entity11 overlooked by @entity11 youth selectors , the @entity26 midfielder took up the @entity3 's offer to join their under - 16s squad			1
by the time the @entity56 got round to calling - up the then talented @entity5 youngster , his mind was made up to stay with @entity3 , who he is eligible to represent through his late grandfather @entity60			2
@entity11 boss @entity61 suggested last week that both @entity2 and @entity43 could be treated like pantomime villains by the @entity11 crowd , while former @entity46 defender @entity48 was quoted in several newspapers on monday claiming the players ' deserved ' to get a ' horrible reaction ' for rejecting their nation of birth			1
but @entity4 - who helped guide @entity2 into the @entity5 team - said : ' i 'd like to think @entity2 wo n't get any reaction really and that the fans will just let the kid go and play his football			1
@entity43 also opted to play for the @entity76 ' at the end of the day , he did n't get picked for @entity11 and @entity3 did			1
so it 's not his fault			0
when you have only got one option , it 's pretty easy to take that option			0
it 's not as if @entity11 came calling			0
' he 's a terrific footballer and i do n't think any of that should have a part to play			0
' @entity2 was given his first - team introduction at @entity5 when he was just 15			2
alongside @entity17 , the pair helped the @entity93 outfit reach the @entity94 before both being plucked down south by @entity29			0
they went on to win @entity98 winners ' medals with the @entity99 before @entity27 took @entity2 with him to @entity26 and @entity17 sealed his own switch to @entity101			2
the best friends have already come up against each other this year in the @entity104 - a 3 - 2 win for the @entity106 at @entity42 six weeks ago - but now they could go head to head on the international stage			0
' to see two young lads who came through the system here go on and play at the top level of international football for their countries will make everybody extremely proud at this club , ' added @entity4			0
' obviously we are @entity119 so we will be supporting @entity11 , but i want @entity2 to have a terrific game			2
' it will be really interesting to see how the two of them get one against each other			0
but knowing the two of them , they are fierce competitors and they will be looking to do well for their own country			0
' but i 'm @entity119 , so i know which one i will be cheering for			0

the @entity3 face @entity11 in a crucial @entity16 qualifier clash on friday night in @entity132
@entity26 star @entity2 , like former @entity44 player @entity43 , chose to play for the @entity3 rather than @entity11
@entity11 legend @entity48 *launched* an *astonishing* attack on @entity2 and @entity43 *insisting* the pair deserve *‘* a horrible reception *’*
@entity4 , who played alongside @entity2 at @entity5 , hopes the home fans take it easy on the @entity26 player
