a voice for men have created a replica of @entity4 's website where they discrediting research on domestic violence and claim ' women are , as often as men , the initiators of violence ' @entity13 based group , a voice for men , have hijacked @entity16 's national anti-domestic violence campaign by launching an identical website and preaching an opposing ideology			1
@entity19 has been set up with the same layout and white ribbon icon as the authentic website - whiteribbon.org.au – but slams the original campaign which focuses on women as victims of domestic violence			1
instead , the group claims that ' women are , as often as men , the initiators of violence ' , adding that they are often ' significantly less remorseful '			2
their primary website also advocates for the abolition of the @entity31 and rape shield laws in the @entity33			0
recent articles published by @entity35 's website focus on discrediting research on domestic violence , with one article titled ' why women 's shelters are hotbeds of gender hatred '			1
one of the website 's prominent writers , @entity46 , was responsible for writing an article in october 2013 in which he wrote : ' in the name of equality and fairness , i am proclaiming october to be bash a @entity52			0
' this is despite research that shows one in three women experience physical or sexual violence by someone they know and that on average , one woman each week is killed as a result of intimate partner violence			0

pictured : volunteers watch a roll call of all the women killed by domestic violence in the last year from around the world @entity80 , @entity4 's national executive for engagement and partnerships , told @entity83 that the organisation was seeking legal advice against the ' men 's rights ' website , which he described as ' an unfortunate nuisance '			1
' we have sought legal advice and we have evidence of possible fraud and intellectual property infringements , ' mr @entity80 said			0
' they are clearly trying to ride out our profile to help them achieve their sinister objective to undermine what we do and undermine the good work our 2000 male ambassadors do each day			2
' that 's the irony of it - we are a male led campaign to highlight the issue of women being overwhelmingly represented in these statistics			2
' the branding from the original and authentic @entity16 wesite , whiteribbon.org.au @entity35 's website , also titled @entity4 , has copied the authentic website 's branding ' we have evidence of possible fraud and intellectual property infringements , ' @entity80 , a spokesperson for @entity4 said of the ' men 's rights ' organisation mr @entity80 also addressed concerns that donors or anyone interested in the work of the @entity4 campaign , may become mislead by the false website and accidentally donate to them			1
