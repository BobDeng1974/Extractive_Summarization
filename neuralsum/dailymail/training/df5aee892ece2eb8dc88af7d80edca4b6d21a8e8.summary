it took less than 24 hours for @entity2 ’s cautious optimism about the fitness of his players to be dimmed after it emerged that @entity6 will miss next year ’s @entity7 following spinal surgery			1
the 23 - year - old lock , a pivotal member of the @entity12 squad when fit , must have his operation on friday to correct the nerve problem in his neck which has caused discomfort for several months			1
@entity17 missed the autumn internationals and had hoped a period of extended rest would cure the debilitating injury			1
but @entity22 director of rugby @entity23 revealed on sunday that this recovery was behind schedule , raising the spectre of surgery			1
@entity6 ( right , in action against @entity30 in july ) will undergo neck surgery on friday @entity33 's injury is understood to be similar to the one sustained by @entity34 last season @entity17 will miss @entity12 's @entity7 campaign in a blow to @entity2 those fears were confirmed on thursday when @entity22 announced the 20 - cap star will have a ‘ routine decompression ’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc which has caused him to lose power in his arm			1
@entity23 said : ‘ as you would expect , this is a frustrating time for @entity6 , but the most important thing in all of this is n’t rugby , it ’s @entity6 ’s long - term health			1
we have consulted specialists in this field and they have recommended surgery as the best option to get him back to full fitness for the long term			1
‘ @entity6 is in good hands			1
he is being looked after by one of the world ’s leading surgeons and he will have the full support of the @entity22 and @entity12 medical teams during his rehabilitation period			0
’ @entity17 ’s recovery is expected to take between three and four months , making it is possible he will not play again this season			1
the news came a day after @entity2 learned of @entity71 prop @entity73 ’s imminent return to action for @entity75			0
the 20 - cap star will have a ‘ routine decompression ’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc @entity17 has not played for @entity22 since november due to his neck problem @entity82 : captain out for four weeks with ‘ stinger ’ shoulder injury			1
@entity6 : out for up to four months with neck surgery pending			1
@entity86 : lengthy lay - off with calf injury			2
@entity89 : lucky if he plays this season ( knee )			0
@entity92 : horrendous run of injuries with setback after setback			0
@entity97 : neck injury is keeping him sidelined			2
@entity99 : groin injury proving hard to shake off			0
@entity101 : back injury causing @entity104 problems			0
recently returned : @entity105 ( concussion ) , @entity107 ( back , knee ) , @entity109 ( shoulder ) , @entity34 ( neck surgery )			1

@entity17 ’s injury — understood to be similar to the one suffered last season by @entity12 prop @entity34 — raises more questions about the high number of neck injuries sustained by rugby ’s top stars			1
some believe those most proficient at ‘ jackling ’ for possession over the ball are especially vulnerable because their necks are exposed at the breakdown			0
another injury causing concern — concussion — looks to have also ruled @entity131 fly - half @entity129 out of action until at least february			2
the @entity134 star has not played since suffering a head injury playing for @entity131 against @entity136 in november and @entity138 newspaper @entity139 reported on thursday that he has been suffering headaches and nausea ever since			0
after consulting a neurologist , it has been decided @entity129 — who was also knocked unconscious in last season ’s final @entity7 clash against @entity147 and was sidelined for several weeks — should not play until february 14 at the earliest			0
that makes the @entity71 no 10 certain to miss @entity131 ’s opening game against @entity150 but with such a notoriously difficult injury to asses , there are fears @entity129 could be out for even longer			0
racing coach @entity155 said : ‘ as long as @entity129 does n’t feel 100 per cent , we can not take any risks			0
’ @entity129 has not played since suffering a head injury playing for @entity131 against @entity136 in november it has been reported that @entity129 will be able to take part in non-contact training , although strict return - to - play protocols say a player can only return to non-contact training 24 hours after becoming symptom free			2
@entity129 has struggled to settle at @entity134 following his move to @entity166 last summer and will return to @entity167 at the end of this season , with @entity30 ’s world - record points scorer @entity170 confirmed yesterday as his replacement			2
@entity170 — who will earn close to £ 800,000 a year — predicts the move will be an ‘ awesome experience ’ , while @entity134 ’s millionaire owner @entity173 denies the 33 - year - old ’s wages are excessive because of his enormous marketing potential			1
‘ @entity170 will be the best - paid player at racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits , ’ @entity173 said			2
meanwhile , @entity179 champions @entity178 are considering suing the two @entity181 supporters whose testimony led to @entity183 receiving a three - month ban on wednesday			2
@entity129 looks certain to miss @entity131 's @entity7 opener against @entity150 , but is in danger of missing even more @entity178 owner @entity187 was incensed by the length of the ban , imposed after a three - man disciplinary panel found the former @entity12 full back guilty of verbally abusing fans following @entity178 ’s @entity193 defeat at @entity194 12 days ago			0
‘ we are n’t discounting the eventuality of going after these two supporters in court for false testimonies , ’ said @entity187			0
‘ this is an extraordinary decision which rests only on the allegations of two opposition supporters , whose objectivity we can legitimately put in doubt			0
‘ there is no formal proof , no official document , not even television pictures , to attest to the veracity of these testimonies			0
