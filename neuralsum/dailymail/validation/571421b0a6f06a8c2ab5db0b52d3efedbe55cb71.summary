as speculation mounts over whether a shockingly out - of - sorts @entity4 will be able to compete at next month 's masters , his good friend @entity1 rates his chances of taking part in the year 's opening major as ' 50 - 50 '			1
woods , a former world no 1 whose ranking has plummeted to 96th , has played only twice on the 2014 - 15 @entity11 and said he would not return until his game was ' tournament - ready '			1
@entity4 , the 14 - time major winner , has struggled to find any form this year ' as far as @entity17 is concerned ... it 's literally a 50 - 50 chance right now from what i can tell , ' @entity1 , who played with @entity4 on the @entity15 golf team , told digital network 120 sports on wednesday			1
' that 's far better odds than what it was , say , three weeks ago			0
three weeks ago , i would have said there was maybe a 1 - in - 10 chance of him playing at @entity17			2
' @entity4 has not competed since he withdrew from the @entity30 early last month after 11 holes because of tightness in his back , and is still adapting to the fifth swing change of his career			1
@entity4 is currently on an indefinite break from the sport but aims to qualify for the 2016 @entity38 he missed the masters at @entity17 last year for the first time in his career after being advised by doctors to have back surgery and his participation this year is in serious doubt given his struggle for form and fitness this season			2
the 14 - time major champion posted the highest score of his professional career as he carded a mind - boggling 11 - over - par 82 to miss the cut at the @entity54 in january , and many pundits believe he is suffering from the chipping ' yips '			0
however , @entity1 , a television analyst with @entity57 , believes @entity4 is now settling into his new swing under the supervision of consultant @entity60			0
@entity4 struggled for form during the @entity54 back in january ' it was good for him to take a step back , to reassess a variety of different things and do things on his timeline , ' said @entity1 , a 42 - year - old @entity68 golfer who won four times on the @entity11			1
' my suggestion to him was to take as much time as he needed to just figure out this issue with his short game and also to work on or clean up a couple of things that might be a little loose with his golf swing			0
' any transition , any change that you are making mechanically , takes a little time to settle , so that 's what he 's done			0
we 've had some good discussions over the last week or so and he feels good about it			0
