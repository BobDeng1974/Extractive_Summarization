@entity1 's baby son was handed a bottle of bleach by a complete stranger in a fast food restaurant in 2011 @entity7 's grandmother looked away from his pram for just a second or two as she waited for her daughter to buy ice cream in their local @entity12			1
but it 's an act that still haunts her , as in those few seconds her precious 11 - month - old grandson had been handed a baby bottle filled with bleach by a complete stranger			1
after drinking from the bottle @entity20 choked and vomited violently but survived thanks to the swift reactions of grandmother @entity23 and his mother @entity1			1
@entity25 , 53 , from @entity26 in south - east @entity27 , has since been found to have committed the act and detained in a mental health hospital			1
as well as attempting to poison @entity20 she has committed several other acts of violence against young children			1
recently the order protecting @entity20 's identity has been lifted and today @entity23 and @entity1 appeared on @entity35 to talk about the ordeal , and explain that they do n't feel any anger towards the boy 's attacker , but ask why she was allowed to remain free when she was obviously a risk to the public			1
@entity23 described how a quick family lunch to @entity44 's on @entity45 , september 13 , 2011 , almost turned to tragedy : ' it was just a normal everyday situation			2
nothing out of the ordinary at all			0
@entity20 was in the aisle in a big pram because he was quite young			2
' my one mistake was glancing out the window , or maybe i drank my coffee and took my eye off him			0
it 's something that i 'll regret forever			0
' i heard him coughing and choking so immediately my eyes were back on him			0
i thought he was choking on a chip			0
@entity20 as a baby at home with mother @entity1 and her fiance @entity64 ' but he was white and he was frothing and he was scared			1
he was frothing and retching as i picked him up and a bottle dropped on to the floor - the type he drinks out of all of the time			2
' it was an orange liquid , wheras he normally drinks milk or water			0
' when @entity73 retruned she said " what have you done ? " , so i said " what have you done ? what have you given him in this bottle ? "			0
' @entity1 added : ' i knew straight away that it was n't his bottle			0
i took the lid off but i did n't need to taste it i could smell it			0
' @entity84 screamed " has anybody seen somebody give this baby a bottle ? "			2
' @entity23 added : ' it was only at that point that we realised something had taken place			0
' you do n't think anyone is going to poison a child			0
it 's the last thing you actually think of			0
' @entity1 ( l ) and her mother @entity23 ( r ) on the sofa with @entity20 , who is now three years old two customers - who became vital witnesses in the case against @entity25 - revealed that they had seen a woman drop a bottle into the pram			1
@entity105 later confirmed that it took just three to five seconds for the dangerous bottle to be within the baby 's grasp			2
@entity20 was taken into hospital and survived without any serious injury			2
the liquid in the bottle was tested and found to be acid but not pure bleach , which could have burnt his trachea , and meant long - term damage or even death			1
today @entity20 , now three years old , is perfectly well and appeared unfazed by the incident as he joined his mother and grandmother on the sofa at the end of the interview			1
his attacker , who has a history of wanting to harm children , remains indefinitely in a mental health hospital			2
when asked about her @entity20 's mother @entity1 told @entity129 : ' she needed help and she needed to be put away somewhere safe where she could n't harm anybody else			1
' @entity23 added : ' i do n't feel anger towards her , because if it 's a mental issue you ca n't help that anymore than you can help having anything , but she should have been dealt with before she got to danger point			0
