by @entity0 published : 02:58 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 06:10 est , 12 august 2013 the price of single train tickets could be halved , it has emerged - although the price of a return could rise in order to pay for it			1
the @entity7 has been in contact with the @entity9 and train operators to discuss the possibility to slash the price of a single fare			1
but the bill looks set to be paid for by taxpayers ' expense and mean return ticket costs might be pushed up			1
could rail fares be slashed ? the price of a single ticket could be halved but return tickets pushed up to pay for it at the moment single fares match the price of return journeys			1
train companies could be given millions of pounds to organise the change as it would alter their operating licences			1
currently , the @entity9 is considering discussing paying a significant amount for a change in fares - but where this money would be found is unclear , and could mean the scrapping of other services to raise the cash , the @entity31 said			1
pilot schemes may begin over the next few months			1
last week it emerged that train fares could rise by more than nine per cent next year for some train journeys			1
it follows an average rise of 4.2 per cent on rail network in 2013 and increases twice that size on some popular routes			1
the talks about single train fares come as part of a review into @entity52 's rail prices			1
but how the commuting public will feel about the potential drop in singles but rise in returns remains to be seen			2
the @entity9 is in talks wit the @entity7 and train companies about the potential change passenger satisfaction with @entity52 ’s crowded , late - running and over-priced railway network has plummeted to the lowest level in six years , a damning survey by official watchdogs revealed in june			1
one in eight passengers said they were unhappy with their unreliable rail services at a time of inflation - busting fare rises and bumper bonuses for rail bosses			2
only four out of ten - 42 per cent - believe train companies give value for money while just 38 per cent are satisfied with their ability to deal with delays			1
the report by consumer watchdog @entity77 said rail companies are ‘ failing to deliver on their basic promises ’ to deliver a reliable time - table and that train travellers deserved a better deal			1
it comes after it was revealed last month that five rail bosses are set to receive £ 11million over three years in an extraordinary deal that critics condemned as rewarding failure			2
the top executives at @entity90 could share bonuses of £ 5million on top of their six - figure salaries , despite years of dismal performance and inflation - busting fare rises			2
the taxpayer - funded firm is currently facing a £ 75million fine for missing its punctuality targets for long distance services			2
@entity90 , a not - for - profit company , has also been dogged by constant complaints over crowded trains and fare rises			2
its five bosses were already earning salaries of between £ 348,000 and £ 577,000 a year , with annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income			2
but in july a new ' long - term incentive ' payment was agreed			0
this additional bonus will be paid at the end of three years and is worth a maximum of a full year ’s salary , depending on performance			0
the new element was rubber - stamped at the company 's annual general meeting in @entity117			0
@entity118 has made the most of a gap in the market following rail hikes with a cashback credit card that enables cardholders to get 3 per cent off the cost of future trains back			0
what do you get ? money back : @entity118 is offering cashback on rail fares @entity118 ’s @entity132 allows for money to be claimed for train tickets bought at stations or online with any rail company , as well as for season tickets and @entity140 tickets			1
the small print there are loopholes			0
there is a £ 300 - a - month limit on which you can claim back money and those travelling in @entity149 are barred from claiming back on tickets booked online with @entity151			0
purchases not eligible for cashback include @entity155 travelcards , passes and @entity157 top ups made at newsagents , garages and off - licences			0
@entity161 and train tickets bought through travel agents or tour operators are also excluded from the deal			1
there is a £ 24 annual fee which is waived for the first year using a fairly complicated refund system			0
to qualify for this refund you must open or hold a 123 @entity171 and set up a direct debit from the 123 @entity171 to pay your 123 @entity132 within 30 days			0
the annual fee charged for the first year will then be refunded to your 123 credit card account within 21 days from the later of either activating your card and / or setting up the direct debit from your 123 @entity171			0
cardholders will have to think carefully as to whether , on balance , the high annual fee cancels out savings made from cashback			0
there is also a high apr of 22.8 per cent - so make sure you pay off your full balance every month to avoid interest			0
additional benefits cardholders also benefit from a lucrative cashback scheme on a range of household bills			0
this includes 1 per cent cashback on all major supermarkets , 2 per cent at all major department stores including @entity195 , @entity196 , and @entity197 , as well as 3 per cent on spends at all major petrol stations			0
@entity118 is also offering a 30 per cent discount deal on home insurance with this card			0
