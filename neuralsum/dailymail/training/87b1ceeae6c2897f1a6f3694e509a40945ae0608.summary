@entity2 , who was educated at @entity15 and @entity16 , said he was ' absolutely useless ' at written tests at school , but is making up for it now by beating his army colleagues at computer games			1
he said : ' you can ask the guys : i thrash them at @entity26 the whole time			0
' in an interview conducted before he flew home to the @entity30 from his deployment as an @entity33 co-pilot gunner ( @entity34 ) , the 28 - year - old revealed how he and his friends in @entity36 based in @entity3 played computer games and ate pizza when they had time off			1
he also talked about his living conditions at the dusty army base , and revealed he was sent a jar of @entity43 honey made by bees at the @entity46 ' official residence			0
the young royal also said his father had sent him a box of @entity51 cigars , some of which he traded with @entity54 soldiers in exchange for their treats from home			0
showing appealing modesty about his obvious skills as a pilot , the @entity2 said his skills at sports and games helped pave the way for him to become a top pilot			1
he said : ' exams were always a nightmare , but anything like kicking a ball around or playing @entity13 - or flying - i do generally find a little bit easier than walking , sometimes			1
' it 's a joy for me because i 'm one of those people who loves playing @entity13 and @entity14 , so with my thumbs i like to think that i 'm probably quite useful			1
' the @entity2 said taking the controls in the helicopter came naturally to him , and he qualified top of his class as a @entity34 despite finding the academic side tricky			1
' thrashing the guys at @entity26 ' : prince @entity2 plays computer games with his fellow @entity82 crew members downtime in @entity84 : the young royal enjoys films and computer games with his friends he said : ' i 'm one of those people that , during my flying course especially , i would be fine at flying			1
' and then every now and then a written test would come up and i 'd be absolutely useless , and i 've been like that from stage one of my youth			2
' @entity2 had to repeat his last year at @entity15 to get into @entity16 in 1998 and his gcse results were never made public , but it was while he was at @entity16 that he began to show his military potential in the cadets			1
after a gap year , the young @entity2 went to @entity100 , despite not going to university , and was then picked for @entity82 co-pilot gunner course			1
he said : ' being a junior captain , or a lieutenant then that i was and a non-grad [ non-graduate ] , obviously not going to university , therefore the army presume you to be less intelligent , which is nice of them - probably true			2
' but there were a couple of us that got pushed forward to the front seat instead of the back seat			0
' after his 18 months of helicopter training in both the @entity30 and @entity54 , the @entity2 won a prize as the best cpg out of his class of more than 20			1
playing it down , he said : ' the only reason i won the award is because i was the only one who did n't slip up at some point			0
' weird reality ' : prince @entity2 complained about being ' stuck ' in @entity3 , but enjoyed flying the @entity128 long way from @entity130 : the @entity2 made good friends with his crew members and was treated like any other soldier ' they had to give the award to someone			1
i was one of the few left standing , so that 's the only reason i got that award			0
' but his commanding officer , lieutenant colonel @entity140 , said he won the prize on merit			0
' that was absolutely the right decision that was made , and he has been performing superbly out here			0
' he really is on top of his game			0
he 's an excellent co-pilot gunner and i think he 's very much enjoying being able to deliver support '			0
captain @entity150 , the other cpg on @entity2 's flight of two @entity128 , said the @entity2 was reliable and sharp in the cockpit			1
he said : ' it 's nice to have someone who you know you can rely on as well in the other aircraft			0
he keeps me on my toes to make sure i stay ahead of the game as well			0
' prince @entity2 out of his uniform at @entity3 and , right , in festive spirit for an @entity163 @entity2 won the respect of his military colleagues at @entity3 for his ability to muck in with them without any special treatment			1
as one of thousands of troops stationed in the isolated base in the @entity173 desert , the @entity2 slept in a converted shipping container , sharing a room and eating and washing with everyone else			2
the soldiers can get a fresh coffee or an alcohol - free beer at the @entity180 , pick up @entity173 souvenirs at one of the local shops , and even get a takeaway at the @entity186 restaurant , also based in a former shipping container			2
they go to the canteen for cooked breakfast , lunch and dinner , take their laundry or ' dhobi ' to the laundrette , and can work out at a number of indoor or outdoor gyms			0
the @entity2 said : ' obviously lots of guys like the luxury and comforts of @entity3 , but what 's weird is we 're stuck in @entity3 and what 's going on out there is completely separate			2
' his closest friends in his unit - nicknamed 662 ' @entity205 by the other @entity207 ( @entity208 ) soldiers - were the other crew members on his flight of two aircraft			2
as part of a four - man @entity82 crew , prince @entity2 had to be ready to sprint to his helicopter ' luxury at its best ' : prince @entity2 joked about his sleeping area , where an old ammunition box was a table @entity2 's four - man flight would usually work three consecutive overnight duties before moving on to other shifts on the aircrew rota			1
while waiting for call - out , they would be in the @entity225 ( very high readiness ) tent , where they would play the military board game @entity230 , watch films , play computer games and chat			1
off - duty , he would sleep in temporary sleeping quarters that he jokingly described as ' luxury at is best , i guess '			0
the third in line to the throne slept under a coverless duvet , with pillows and a black sleeping bag on a burgundy sprung mattress			0
he said : ' it 's flat , it 's got springs , but it 's better than a cot - bed , which is what all the other guys are sleeping in , when you ca n't really roll left to right and you 're stuck in a @entity253 ' he had an empty ammunition box as a beside table , home to his alarm clock and earplugs , and plain walls with a couple of rugs on the ground			0
the @entity82 helicopter co-piloted by hrh prince @entity2 just before lift - off on a night mission from @entity3 in @entity173 night - time mission : once the call comes , @entity2 and his crew members have to race to their @entity82 and scramble out over @entity84 in the @entity225 tent , the soldiers had a well - stocked kitchen with fridge , toaster , microwave , and snacks including chocolate bars and jars of @entity278			1
' a free minibar would be great ' , @entity2 joked			2
the soldiers played computer games such as @entity282 with a fierce competitiveness , and agreed that their royal colleague was second in the rankings			1
they also watched endless films on their 32 - inch colour television , with piles of dvds ranging from @entity290 and @entity291 to the @entity292 and @entity293			2
the @entity2 said : ' we 've probably got every dvd , every film known to mankind , and we 've probably watched all of them			2
' in the run - up to @entity300 , @entity2 put on a @entity300 hat complete with pigtails			1
prince @entity2 walks towards the @entity225 ( very high readiness ) tent to start his 12 - hour shift at the @entity30 - controlled flight - line in @entity3 in southern @entity173 he said : ' we watched a repeat of the @entity309 , which was quite entertaining			1
' ' when we started we 'd be called out once , maybe twice at the most , but now it 's cold it 's fairly quiet			0
less stuff happens at night			0
' the @entity2 would get up early when it was his turn to make a cafetiere of coffee for his crew members , and joked he was so tired that he was still asleep			2
capt @entity150 said : ' it 's easy to put aside the fact that he 's third - in - line to the throne			0
he 's a normal guy			0
' he said he did n't think twice before teasing the @entity2 , because ' he 's pretty forward on the banter as well - it 's just part of us all being together			1
' the @entity2 's squadron commander , @entity323 , said : ' i think he enjoys the relative anonymity of being in theatre where he is allowed to get on with his daily business relatively unmolested and as a squadron we are very much one big family			2
' prince @entity2 , who previously served on the ground coordinating air strikes on the @entity333 during his 2007 - 2008 tour in @entity173 , says he missed being on the ground			1
standing in front of his Â£ 45m @entity82 helicopter , he said : ' it 's a pain in the a * * * being stuck in @entity3 ; going to the cookhouse with hundreds of people - it 's frustrating			0
' but then again , i get to fly this thing , so it comes with pros and cons. '			0

old *etonian* soldier says he was ' useless at exams ' but wins on the @entity14
the 28 - year - old @entity2 says computer games helped him be a good pilot
