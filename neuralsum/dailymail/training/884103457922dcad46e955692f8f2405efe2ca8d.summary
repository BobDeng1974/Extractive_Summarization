by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 19:28 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 20:00 est , 4 march 2014 a @entity4 judge has slapped @entity6 congressman @entity5 with a restraining order after his estranged wife complained that he had battered her over the weekend and said she feared for her safety and the safety of their two smallest children			1
@entity14 's sworn complaint says the congressman ' showed up , unannounced ' as she was preparing to take the two young children to a play date and asked to speak with her inside their house			1
when she refused , according to a sheriff 's office document , he ' deliberately and with force pushed [ @entity14 ] very hard against the front door , causing [ her ] to fall to the ground as a result			1
' after telling her husband not to touch her , @entity14 said , she pushed him in the face and struck him in the stomach with her knee ' in order to protect and defend herself , ' then called 911			1
the accusations ' are absolutely false , completely unfounded , and clearly designed to vilify and harm congressman @entity5 , ' @entity45 said in a statement			2
' congressman @entity5 firmly denies ms. @entity14 's frivolous accusations			1
' a member of @entity5 's staff told the @entity57 that he watched the exchange from 15 feet away , and denied that his boss assaulted anyone			1
' absolutely not , ' said @entity61 , the congressman 's director of constituent services			1
' it 's just unfortunate that this is happening and that she would say something like this			0
' @entity5 's office piled on later in the day , saying that ' [ s ] adly , it was ms. @entity14 who physically attacked the congressman as he attempted to visit with his children			1
' ' he did not respond to ms. @entity14 ’s violent assault , ' read a statement			2
@entity5 caught flak from @entity76 when he claimed during a @entity44 speech that the @entity78 wanted sick @entity1 to ' @entity79 ' @entity5 once compared @entity81 conservatives to the @entity82 , claiming that both were equal sources of hate and intolerance but @entity14 's petition added that while she spoke with the emergency operator , rep. @entity5 told her within earshot of their kids that she ' would receive nothing ' in their divorce and would be left ' in the gutter			1
' she also alleges that ' from time to time ' in the past , the congressman ' has battered [ her ] and the parties ' minor children ' in incidents that did not lead her to file for injunctions from the courts			2
the result , she claims , is that his ' history of violence ' toward her has made her fear for her safety			0
@entity107 reported that the congressman 's wife filed for divorce two months ago , and that her attorneys filed photos showing ' large bruises to her left leg and left shoulder			1
' the @entity116 declined to provide the photos to @entity118			0
a hearing is scheduled on march 20			1
the injunction will remain in force at least until that date			0
@entity5 is a @entity6 lightning rod in the @entity44			2
in october his re-election campaign emailed a fundraising solicitation that compared the conservative tea party to the @entity82			0
a burning cross took the place of the ' t ' in ' @entity81			0
' @entity5 's campaign slogan , ' a congressman with guts , ' may come back to haunt him in divorce proceedings if his wife 's charges are substantiated he later defended the mailing , citing ' overwhelming evidence that the tea party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in @entity1 today , just as the @entity82 was for an earlier generation			1
' in september 2009 @entity5 combated @entity76 ' objections to the @entity143 by slamming the @entity78 's proposed alternatives in fiery rhetoric on the @entity44 floor			2
' if you get sick , @entity1 , ' he said , ' the @entity78 health care plan is this : die quickly			0
' signs behind him during the short speech read , ' the @entity78 health care plan : do n't get sick			0
and if you do get sick ... die quickly			0
' @entity154 @entity153 rep. @entity153 broke with decorum on the spot to lay into @entity5 , saying , ' that is about the most mean - spirited partisan statement that i 've ever heard made on this floor , and i , for one , do n't appreciate it			2
' offering a passive - aggressive apology , @entity5 later returned to the floor to say that ' “ i apologize to the dead and their families that we have n't voted sooner to end this holocaust in @entity1			0
' @entity5 has also used targeted websites to oppose military action in @entity169 and to shame @entity78 with a lengthy list of @entity1 he claimed had died because they lacked health insurance			0
an aide to retired @entity174 lt. col. @entity173 , who defeated @entity5 in a 2010 election before losing the seat back to him in 2012 , declined comment			0
col. @entity173 has been married for 25 years and has two teenage daughters with his wife @entity179 .			0
