the average pensioner living in a developed country is less likely to suffer from dementia today than in the past , doctors say			0
studies show that the risk of the disease seems to be falling in the @entity7 , @entity8 and other wealthy nations			1
the increased use of blood pressure and cholesterol - busting drugs and better standards of education are credited with keeping the brain sharper for longer			1
rates of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias are falling in the developed world - but increasing in poorer nations , new research has shown			1
image shows a brain with @entity24 's however , a major @entity24 ’s conference heard that there is no room for complacency			0
the ageing population means the number of cases is still rising in rich countries , while the number of people with dementia in the developing world is thought to have been severely underestimated			1
and improvements in brain health in recent years could be jeopardised by the rising tide of obesity			1
a series of studies have shown that a person ’s risk of @entity24 ’s and other forms of dementia is falling in the @entity8 and @entity48 , the @entity41 in @entity42 heard			1
a @entity8 government - funded study found that an @entity8 aged 60 - plus today is almost half as likely to develop dementia than someone of a similar age did roughly 30 years ago			1
the fall in risk has been particularly steep in women , and the average age at which dementia is diagnosed has risen – from 80 in the 1970s to 85 today			2
a similar @entity7 analysis , published in the @entity60 medical journal last year , found the chances of developing dementia in old age have fallen by almost a quarter since the 1990s			0
studies from @entity65 , @entity66 and the @entity67 show a similar pattern			2
it is thought that the increasing number of drugs prescribed to combat heart disease is helping to keep dementia at bay by keeping the brain healthy			1
the fall in smoking , another risk factor for dementia , is also likely to have helped			0
experts say rates of dementia are falling thanks to risk factors for the disease - such as high blood pressure and cholesterol - are better controlled and increasing access to education is thought to be vital , with studies showing that the longer a person spends at school and university the slower their descent into the disease			1
more challenging careers have a similar protective effect			0
@entity95 , of @entity96 , who compiled the @entity8 figures , said greater equality in the job market could help explain why rates have fallen particularly among women			1
‘ the results bring some hope that perhaps dementia cases may be preventable or at least delayed , ’ she added			0
‘ the number of people aged 65 and older is going to almost treble in the next 40 years worldwide			2
this means that dementia is still going to be front and centre as a public health issue ' - dr @entity111 dr @entity111 , a @entity112 expert on ageing who spoke at the conference , said : ‘ for an individual , the actual risk of dementia seems to have declined			2
‘ i believe the evidence is pretty strong that lifestyle changes , especially increasing physical activity , maintaining a healthy weight , eating a healthy @entity123 diet , and controlling one ’s blood pressure , can help reduce the risk of dementia			1
‘ on a societal level , increasing opportunities for children to have good educations and keep their brains active and stimulated also seems important for reducing dementia risk later in life			2
’ however , dr @entity111 pointed out that the ageing population means the total number of cases is still on the rise			2
he said : ‘ the number of people aged 65 and older is going to almost treble in the next 40 years worldwide			0
this means that dementia is still going to be front and centre as a public health issue			0
’ others warned that the obesity epidemic could undo the progress			0
previous research has shown that those who are obese in middle - age are almost four times as likely to develop dementia in old age as those who keep their weight in check			0
the exact reasons are unknown but high blood pressure and cholesterol associated with obesity could interrupt the brain ’s blood supply , while hormones and other chemicals released by fat stores may harm the brain			1
@entity165 , chief executive of @entity166 , said : ‘ while there is no simple way to prevent the condition , it is positive to see that improvements in healthcare for other conditions could be helping to stem the tide of dementia			0
‘ @entity175 will tell whether rising trends in obesity could set back this progress in the coming years			0

average @entity8 over 60 has *44* *%* lower risk of disease than 30 years ago
number of new cases in @entity65 has also ' *significantly* declined '
better control of high blood pressure and cholesterol most likely reason
but rates in poorer counties are increasing *due* to obesity and *diabetes*
