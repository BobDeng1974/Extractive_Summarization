former @entity1 premier @entity0 may have been one of the biggest scalps of the corruption inquiry into property developer donations for the @entity5 but he insists that he ' is not the big man '			1
the identity of the so - called ' big man ' who was behind a massive donation remains a mystery after mr @entity0 not only denied it was him but also said he did n't know who the big man was			1
sidelined police minister @entity15 and former energy minister @entity16 have both told the @entity17 that mr @entity0 was known as the ' big man '			1
' someone will always try and rort the system ' mr @entity0 said outside the corruption inquiry into property developer donations to the @entity1 @entity5 sidelined police minister @entity15 called the former @entity25 various names including ' boss ' and ' @entity0 ' but never ' the big man ' according to mr @entity0 the inquiry has heard differing versions about just who the ` big man ' is , with some saying it was coal magnate @entity33 while others have suggested it was mr @entity0 but the one - time leader of @entity5 , who resigned after denying he 'd received a $ 3000 bottle of win from a lobbyist , said he was called many things by mr @entity15 but never ' the big man '			1
' i do n't know who the big man is , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity17			1
' what i do know is that in any meetings with mr @entity15 , he either called me @entity47 , he either called me boss in that curious police jargon or if someone else was present , he would call me premier			0
' the inquiry has heard differing versions about just who the ` big man ' is , with some saying it was coal magnate @entity33 while others have suggested it was mr @entity0			1
the ` big man ' term shot to prominence as a result of a december 2010 text message from disgraced @entity65 mp @entity64 's campaign manager to mr @entity15 asking ' how 's our big man going with the $ 120k ? ' being tendered as evidence			2
but the identity remains a mystery			0
' i do n't know who the big man is , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity17			1
the corruption inquiry has led to nine @entity5 mps stepping down , including the former @entity25 mr @entity15 last week said he could n't remember receiving the ' big man ' text			1
while giving evidence earlier in the inquiry , mr @entity64 's former campaign manager said the ` big man ' was mr @entity33 and that mr @entity15 was ' making ' the $ 120,000 donation happen			1
property developers , such as mr @entity33 , have been banned from making political donations to @entity1 parties since 2009			0
however , mr @entity15 's lawyer has spent hours arguing the ' big man ' was the former premier , who as @entity86 in late 2010 kept a close eye on campaign funding			2
mr @entity33 has also fronted the inquiry and said he knew nothing about the mysterious ` big man '			0
the $ 120,000 was allegedly being sought to fund 2011 election campaigns in the @entity93			2
but mr @entity0 said he was n't directly involved in fundraising			0
' the only fundraising activities i was engaged in relation to the @entity93 was the usual events that i was asked to front up to attend , ' he said			0
@entity0 ( left ) says ' what i do know is that in any meetings with mr @entity15 ( right ) , he either called me @entity47 , he either called me boss in that curious police jargon or if someone else was present , he would call me premier ' outside the commission , mr @entity0 said the record of the @entity1 liberal @entity108 since winning the 2011 election had been ' overshadowed by revelations of the actions of a very few people '			0
' it 's bitterly disappointing for me to see in the lead - up to that 2011 election campaign a small number of people decided to illegally raise funds and therefore detract from the efforts of the state @entity5 government , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' that 's what galling about this process			0
' the former @entity25 said his party colleagues knew the rules			0
' yes the rules change but i would expect people to abide by those rule changes , ' he said he said as @entity25 he had given the @entity17 record powers but added ' that someone will always try and rort the system ' .			0
