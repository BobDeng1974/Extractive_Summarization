by @entity0 a major criticism of electric cars is that they do n’t have the style and personality of many petrol - powered vehicles			1
the next best thing , therefore , is to take a classic , iconic car and transform it with an electric motor			2
that was the thinking behind @entity12 ’s @entity11 who specialises in turning the @entity13 into a quieter , smoother , battery - powered car			1
at a launch event in @entity26 , riders took the iconic motorcycle brand 's experimental machine across the @entity29 and through the streets of the city centre			0
like other electric vehicles , the engine on @entity21 's @entity34 prototype is silent , although the meshing of gears reportedly makes a hum like a jet aeroplane taking off , quietly			2
its 74 horsepower engine has a top speed of 92mph ( 148km/h )			0
mr @entity11 begins by replacing the engines of classic @entity19 , built between 1958 and 1966 , with electric motors			1
battery packs are fitted under the hood , and behind the car ’s rear seats to distribute the extra weight more evenly			1
this means the car ’s original balance is maintained , despite the extra 350lb ( 158kg ) weight			1
mr @entity11 , with help from electric car experts at @entity58 , then increases the car ’s suspension and fits stronger brake discs to account for this extra weight			1
electric cars typically have a single - speed transmission , but mr @entity11 keeps the @entity13 ’s four - speed transmission to allow for manual gear changes – although this is optional			1
the left - hand image shows how the 1285cc engine in the rear of the @entity13 1300 from 1966 traditionally looks like			1
the right - hand image shows this engine replaced by @entity71 's electric motor battery packs are fitted under the hood , and behind the car 's rear seats to distribute the extra weight more evenly			1
this means the car 's original balance is maintained , despite the extra 350lb ( 158kg ) weight			0
the car 's suspension is then increased , and stronger brake discs are fitted , to account for the extra weight the company has already made a red , and a black prototype , and plans to build models it can sell within the next year			1
a completed car is expected to cost $ 45,000 ( £ 26,300 )			1
the car lasts up to 110 miles ( 177 km ) on a single charge , and has a top speed of 90mph ( 144km/h )			1
‘ retrofitting a classic with an electric drivetrain just makes good sense , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ this makes best use of an existing car rather than using new non-renewable resources to create one from scratch			0
electric cars typically have a single - speed transmission , but @entity100 keeps the @entity13 's four - speed transmission to allow for manual gear changes - although this is optional			2
the @entity104 's speedometer is pictured the car lasts up to 110 miles ( 177 km ) on a single charge , and has a top speed of 90mph ( 144km/h )			1
it is expected to sell for $ 45,000 ( £ 26,300 ) when it goes on sale next year ‘ investment - grade vintage beetles continue to rise in value , and when @entity113 are incredibly smooth , quiet , and super fun to drive			1
’ @entity11 said he chose models built between 1958 and 1966 because they are the most driveable and collectible beetles			1
unlike earlier versions , these models are built to handle the increased torque of the @entity119 drivetrain along with more than double the original horsepower			2
the only metal modifications that take place during a @entity119 installation are limited to holes to accommodate wiring			0
the @entity13 was devised by @entity126 who created a plan to solve @entity129 's unemployment problem by building autobahns for motor vehicles			0
@entity132 began on the roads in 1933 , but the car was not finished until 1939 when production was handed over to the @entity129 @entity136			0
a 1930s @entity19 ad is pictured the @entity13 was devised by @entity126 who , while in prison in 1924 , created a plan to solve @entity129 ’s unemployment problem by building autobahns for motor vehicles			1
this involved mass producing a car , which later became the @entity19			2
@entity132 began on the roads in september 1933 , but the car was not finished until 1939 when production was handed over to the @entity129 @entity136 at the start of the war			0
the original design was for a car with a top speed of 62 mph ( 99km/h ) , that would transport two adults and three children and not cost more than £ 86			2
@entity126 also had plans for the styling of the @entity19 , he is reputed to have said : it should look like a @entity13 , you have to look to nature to find out what streamlining is			2
’ in 1946 , a total of 7,677 @entity162 had been built and in 1947 this figure rose to 8,987			0
by 1948 , production had increased to 19,244			0
the most famous @entity13 is @entity165 ( pictured ) - a 1963 bug which was the main character in @entity167 films , starting with the 1968 film @entity13			0
in the films , @entity165 has a mind of its own and is capable of driving itself , and competing in races various changes were made to the beetle over the years including the removal of the split window to a small oval shape , and in 1953 the engine size was increased			0
in august 1955 @entity13 production reached 1 million			0
over the years , larger engines were fitted to @entity182 , but the biggest redesigns were made between 1970 and 1973			0
the 1302 @entity13 was designed to overcome criticism of the @entity13 's small under bonnet capacity , while the 1303 had an increased curved windscreen , shorter bonnet and a plastic padded dashboard			0
the @entity13 reached it 's highest ever production total in 1969 when it sold 1,076,897 cars , but after 1971 production fell			0
in 1974 @entity19 made a loss of £ 142.5 million , the first loss in the firm ’s history and it switched its focus to the then new @entity197			1
the most famous @entity13 is @entity198 which was the main character in @entity167 films , starting with the 1968 film @entity13			0
in the films , @entity165 has a mind of its own and is capable of driving itself , and competing in races .			0

the electric model was created by @entity17 inventor @entity11
he replaces petrol engines with electric motors in @entity19 released between 1958 and 1966
battery packs are fitted in the engine and behind the car ’s rear seats
car lasts 110 miles ( 177 km ) on one charge and reaches 90mph ( 144km/h )
@entity100 has built two prototypes and claims models should be ready to sell next year for $ 45,000 ( £ 26,300 )
