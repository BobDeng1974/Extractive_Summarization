by @entity0 a couple from @entity2 who believed they met each other at university found that their paths crossed years earlier when they were both children at pre-school			1

familiar face ? @entity9 and @entity10 are coming up on their 10 year anniversary , but an old photo revealed that they actually met much , much earlier - in preschool save the date : wedding bells could have been in the air as long as 17 years before they finally got together ... they were shocked when they discovered that , though they 're from different towns , they had a picture together from 17 years before they ' met ' the couple only found out about their previous encounter 18 months into their relationship			1
they always knew that they had attended the same preschool for a brief period of time when @entity9 lived in the town of @entity53 with his aunt			1
however , they did not realize that they ended up participating in the same events as one another			0
the pair have no memory of each other as kids but after finding an old photo taken at his preschool 's @entity26 parade , @entity9 spotted a little girl dressed in pink			1
' i vaguely remembered having a photo from that period of time , ' @entity9 said			1
he rummaged through old photos , and came across a single photo from @entity26 during his time in @entity53			1
he spotted a little blonde girl that looked a whole lot like his then - girlfriend			0
' i was sitting at work and he called me and said , ‘ hey , i found this picture			0
when you were in preschool , what was your @entity26 costume ? ' the 35 - year - olds met at a club near @entity13 , their alma mater , and started dating when @entity9 was a senior at @entity13 , but they actually ' met ' when they were both much younger she said she was a genie , which matched the girl in the photo			1
' i sat there looking at the wall thinking ‘ this is incredible			0
’ ' ' never did i think she ’d be the girl standing two feet from me , ' @entity9 added			2
he ’s hesitant to call it ' destiny , ' but rather ' pretty phenomenal happenstance			0
' ' we were always kind of in each other ’s orbits , we were just waiting for the stars to align			0
' very rarely in life do you see how all pieces fall into places to make things happen			0
' ' it was a pretty amazing revelation that despite me spending a majority of my childhood in @entity11 , we managed to go to preschool together , ' @entity9 told @entity112			1
the couple also found out that they lived in the same dorm freshman at @entity13 and that he even server her beignets at the cafe he used to work in			2
about a year after discovering the picture , the couple got engaged			2
they even used the incredible flashback photo as their ' @entity124 ' wedding announcement			0
the couple have now been together a decade and will celebrate their 10th anniversary in april			0
whether it be divine intervention or just plain good luck , @entity9 believes the picture is proof that they are meant to be together			2
' life is hard and sometimes our orbits get further apart , but then they come back together and i could n't be more grateful to have such a wonderful partner in life , ' he said			0
