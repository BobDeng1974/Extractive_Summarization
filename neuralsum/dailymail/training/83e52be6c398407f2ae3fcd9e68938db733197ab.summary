her body has never been found , there is no weapon , no crime scene and her husband appeared to have a cast iron alibi for the day she disappeared			0
with over 70 witnesses and 104 pieces of evidence the complex case was dissected firstly by the prosecution @entity58 and then the defence @entity60 @entity59			1
judges ' verdicts and sentencing will be allowed in the @entity65 from october @entity35 was first brought to trial in 2003 for the murder of his wife and was found guilty			1
but @entity70 argued that the trial was a miscarriage of justice and challenged the verdict			0

' unprecedented : in a legal first , a documentary crew were able to film the retrial of @entity35 , left , convicted of murdering his wife @entity37 , right , at the @entity98 for a second time access : cameras were allowed to follow an entire case - including to its court room climax - for the @entity28 documentary @entity104 , pictured historic : in a first in @entity109 legal history , cameras recorded legal proceedings from inside the court room warning : some legal experts have warned opening up the court room to cameras could harm justice broadcasters will be allowed into the @entity117 from october and this is likely to be extended to crown court prosecutions			1
