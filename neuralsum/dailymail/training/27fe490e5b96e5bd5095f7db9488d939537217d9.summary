statins could be used to treat multiple sclerosis but are being blocked by @entity5 red tape , a charity has claimed			1
the @entity6 believes cholesterol - busting statins could help treat @entity3 but are not prescribed because of strict @entity5 rules that prevent drugs being re-licensed for conditions other than that for which they were originally designed			1
the disease affects nerves in the brain , eyes and spinal cord , often causing patients to lose basic bodily functions			1
the @entity6 believes cholesterol - busting statins could help treat ms initial trials conducted show that simvastatin , a drug traditionally prescribed to those suffering from heart disease , could slow the breakdown of the tissues in the brain by 40 per cent			1
but the drug is not being given to @entity3 sufferers because of laws which prevent old drugs being re-licensed			1
the patent for simvastatin expired in 2004 and a new licence would be required to make the drug widely available , the charity has said			2
in a letter to today ’s @entity37 , the charity described giving old medication a new purpose as ‘ a fast and cost effective way ’ to provide new treatments			0
the @entity43 is now asking people to lobby their mp to attend the off - patent @entity47 reading , which will be held in the @entity48 this friday			2
the bill could help tens of thousands ms sufferers currently receiving no effective treatment according to the @entity43			2
initial trials conducted show that simvastatin could slow the breakdown of tissues in the brain by 40 % the letter to the newspaper has been signed by half a dozen medical experts including five neurologists			0
@entity60 , the charity ’s chief executive , said that denying patients from receiving the medication was ‘ nonsensical ’ and called for mps to ‘ cut the red tape ’			0
she said : ‘ in progressive ms , symptoms gradually worsen and there are currently no medicines that can slow or stop the accumulation of disability			0
‘ this can leave people desperate and willing to try anything and we know some even consider unproven therapies or interventions which might be expensive and dangerous			0
‘ in the example of simvastatin , if phase 3 trials are successful , it would be cruel to tell people we have finally found a drug that might slow the progression of their ms but they can not have it			0
