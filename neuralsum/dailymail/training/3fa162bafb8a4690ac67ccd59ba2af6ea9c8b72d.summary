by @entity0 a pair of biscuits which amazingly survived some of the bloodiest battles of the @entity5 are to go under the hammer			1
the bidding at @entity8 in @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11 , will start at £ 60 , but huge worldwide interest sparked by the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity5 make a much higher final figure likely			1
a soldier , @entity16 , who fought in the bloody battles of @entity18 and the @entity18 in @entity19 , brought the biscuits home with him			1
tough : these biscuits from a major campaign in the @entity5 will go under the hammer next week			1
they are almost 100 years old @entity25 , of @entity27 auctioneers , with the enduring wartime ' treats '			0
interest in the @entity5 is at a peak and is expected to drive up the price he is thought to be lt @entity33 of the @entity34 , @entity35 , said to have lived for a time at @entity36 , @entity37			1
the biscuits have been preserved for 99 years and now the bizarre war - time keepsakes are to be sold			2
each one has a label on that reads ' biscuits used by troops in @entity44 ' , the @entity19 peninsula captured by @entity47 forces after horrific fighting and massive losses			1
dr @entity50 of the @entity51 is an expert on food eaten by soldiers during the conflict and is the author of ' the stomach for fighting : food and the @entity58 of @entity5 '			1
@entity47 troops returning from the trenches during the @entity62 campaign			2
much of the campaign was a shambles and @entity66 losses were heavy she said : ' the reason they last so long is they 're pretty much inedible			2
they 're made from flour , salt and water and that 's about it			1
' they 're rock hard			0
' the three ingredients are mixed into a paste and then baked for about 45 minutes on a high heat - a recipe dr @entity50 has tried			1
she added : ' they are just dreadful			0
they 're like the worst children 's rusk ever			0
' could the one up for auction still be edible ? dr @entity50 would n't advise taking a bite			2
' i do n't think they would kill you			2
i would n't want to try though			2
' at the start of the war , @entity47 soldiers at the front were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day , but this soon fell as supply lines were disrupted due thanks to naval blockades and the chaos of war			2
by 1916 , the meat ration was down to 6oz a day , and as the war wore on , meat was only provided once every nine days			0
other goods provided - nearly always tinned - were tea , bacon , cheese , jam and ( famously disgusting ) meat stews			0
soldiers were forced to fend for themselves and reportedly grew vegetable patches in reserve trenches and hunted and fished in quiet moments			2
cooks tried to find local vegetables when possible , but were often forced to use weeds , nettles and leaves to add to stews and soups			0
flour was scarce in 1916 and ground - up turnips were used as a substitute , resulting in bread that gave soldiers severe stomach problems			1
tommies were also forced to endure pea - soup with horse meat chunks			0
by the time troops began to land at @entity44 the @entity19 were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price the biscuits are famous for the hardness and longevity that has seen many survive for nearly a century			1
indeed , some were so tough soldiers turned them into picture frames			1
the @entity142 had 12 different recipes for its biscuits and bought more than 129m lbs ( 58.5m kg ) of biscuits in 1918 alone , at a cost of £ 3,394,000			0
they were incredibly difficult to bite into , but soldiers would dunk them in their tea or crumble them into the stews that were a daily staple on the front line			0
@entity155 , the auction manager of @entity27 , said : ' this 100th anniversary year since the start of @entity5 makes all memorabilia from the period collectable , including biscuits			1
' this lot is being viewed with great interest by many 1914 - 18 conflict collectors			0
' the biscuits will be sold next thursday , the second day of the special two - day fine arts sale			0
troops going to land at @entity18 on barges			0
the barges were later used as water storage tanks on the beaches @entity47 and @entity171 forces launched a massive naval attack on @entity19 forces in the @entity62 , the strategically vital strait in north - western @entity19 separating @entity175 from @entity176 , in the spring of 1915			1
the onslaught was opened on march 18 by 10 @entity66 battleships			0
allied forces had bombarded and destroyed @entity19 forts near the entrance to the @entity62			1
but the deadly waters were still heavily mined , forcing @entity47 and @entity171 to sweep the area before its fleet could set out			0
three battleships were sunk and two more badly damaged			0
by the time troops began to land on april 25 the @entity19 were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price			1
the landing at @entity44 was an amphibious landing made on the @entity192 coast of the @entity18 peninsula in the @entity194			0
it was a desperate attempt to break the deadlock of the @entity18 but was hindered by mismanagement and the troops were eventually forced to retreat by a robust @entity19 defence			1
in the wake of the battle the @entity47 commander at @entity44 , lieutenant - general sir @entity201 , was dismissed			0
the 61 - year - old slept as the landings took place and his performance in command is seen as one of the most incompetent feats of leadership of the @entity5			1
@entity66 troops were finally evacuated in december 1915 and january 1916 after months of bitter bloodshed in one of the most disastrous campaigns of the war			0
the @entity19 lost 300,000 men and the allies about 214,000 .			2
