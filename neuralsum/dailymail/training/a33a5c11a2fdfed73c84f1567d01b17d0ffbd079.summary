the next phase in the hunt for missing @entity2 is under way after a ship with specialised sonar equipment began searching in the area where the plane is thought to have crashed			1
the @entity8 disappeared with 239 people on march 8 after veering dramatically off course between @entity10 and @entity11			0
the plane is thought to have been flying on autopilot at the time			0
experts believe the plane crashed about 1,100 miles off the @entity17 coast , which is where the @entity20 - contracted @entity19 vessel began hunting for traces of wreckage or jet fuel today			1
the @entity19 will be joined later this month by two ships sent by @entity27 contractor @entity26 as part of an operation that could last more than a year			1
a bathymetric survey currently underway is focussed on gathering more detailed and higher resolution data in preparation for the underwater search phase @entity17 's @entity43 said @entity19 will conduct operations in the area for about 12 days before sailing to @entity46 to be resupplied			1
@entity47 , which is currently using sonar techology to search the sea floor , is likely to be used as a general search vessel when it finishes carrying out bathymetric tests later this month			1
more than 68,000 square miles of the search area has been analysed and mapped so far and a massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane			1
@entity19 , the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search , departed @entity61 in @entity62 more than a week ago , after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter			2
it began its search today , deploying underwater sonar on the end of five mile long cable that will enable it to scan the area from within 100 metres of the ocean floor			1
the signals the ship receives back can then give a detailed reading of the sea floor mile by mile			0
the new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys , which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern @entity86 , where it 's believed to have run out of fuel			2
the primary search zone - dubbed the ' priority area ' - is an arc 23,000 square miles in size - the size of @entity93 - 1,120 miles off @entity17 's coast			1
one of the key issues the search team is likely to come up against over the next few months is unpredictable weather			0
although the area is currently calm , huge storms and swells can emerge seemingly out of nowhere			0
such conditions can badly disrupt the location of the underwater sonar cables			0
images from the bathymetric survey being conducted in the latest @entity2 search area : they provide information including the contours , depths and hardness of the ocean floor to ensure the safe and effective operation of equipment in the search these images show remnants of volcanoes , towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named @entity123 , an extensive linear , mountainous sea floor structure this bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level ( purple ) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level ( red ) vessels will also be joining @entity19 including @entity135 which has completed fit out works in @entity137 , @entity138 and is en - route to @entity17 where it is expected to arrive in @entity140 on sunday			1
@entity141 , the vessel currently being used to survey the search area , is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of october			2
' it 's not clear how long that search will take , ' @entity17 's transport minister @entity147 told the @entity150			0
` we would hope , obviously , to find the aircraft on the first day , but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact , ' he added			2
very few marine surveys have taken place in the @entity2 search area			0
previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth the area being searched for @entity2 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc ( grey ) in the southern @entity86 , 1800km off the @entity168 coast the yellow markings represent the area surveyed via bathymetric surveys the search operation is a joint effort by @entity17 and @entity20 costing Â£ 31million			1
there has been many theories as to what happened to the @entity2 but there 's been increased interest on the pilot , @entity179 who reportedly used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island			0
all 12 members of staff on board the flight - including both pilots - were @entity20 nationals			0
of the 227 passengers , 152 were @entity191 citizens , including a group of 19 artists with six family members and four staff returning from a calligraphy exhibition of their work in @entity10			0
38 passengers were @entity20 , while the remaining 37 passengers were made up of individuals from the @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity17 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , the @entity27 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity205 , @entity208 and @entity62 .			2

@entity20 - contracted @entity19 search vessel began new hunt today
will use specialised equipment to scout ocean floor for *debris* or fuel
search is taking place in an ' arc ' 1,100 miles of the west coast of @entity17
more than 68,000 square miles of area previously analysed and mapped
@entity225 will be joined by two @entity27 search vessels later this month
@entity228 could take more than a year to find the missing @entity8
