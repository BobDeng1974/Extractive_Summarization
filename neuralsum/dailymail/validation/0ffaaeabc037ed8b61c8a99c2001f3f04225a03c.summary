some apps for @entity2 smartphones are tracking people 's movements every three minutes			1
this is according to a @entity7 study that found apps can collect a device 's gps coordinates on average of 6,200 times over two weeks			1
the study also revealed that most smartphone users have no idea how closely they are being tracked , and many were surprised by the results			1
scientists asked 23 users of @entity2 's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests			1
they found that even when an app provided a location based service , some attempted to collect more data than was needed			1
@entity26 , for instance , requested one participant 's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks scientists at @entity31 asked 23 users of @entity2 's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests , according to a report by @entity35 in the @entity36			1
they found that even when an app provided a location based service , some attempted to collect more data than was needed			1
@entity26 , for instance , requested one participant 's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks			1
meanwhile , the @entity44 's app requested device location an average 2,000 times , or every 10 minutes			1
the main focus of the study , however , was on how users reacted to how often their data was being shared			1
they received a daily message , or ' privacy nudge , ' telling them how many times information such as location , contact lists or phone call logs had been shared			1
one notable example : ' your location has been shared 5,398 times with @entity64 , @entity26 , @entity65 and seven other apps in the last 14 days			1
' when the participants were given access to @entity70 , they collectively reviewed their app permissions 51 times and restricted 272 permissions on 76 distinct apps ' 4,182 ( times ) – are you kidding me ? ' one participant asked			2
' it felt like i 'm being followed by my own phone			0
that number is too high			0
' another participant said : ' the number ( 356 times ) was huge , unexpected			2
' ' the vast majority of people have no clue about what 's going on , ' said @entity90 , a professor in the @entity92 's @entity91			0
' most smartphone users , in fact , have no way of obtaining this data about app behaviour			1
but the study shows that when they do , they tend to act rapidly to change their privacy settings			0
' millions of people are being spied on by free apps they have installed on their mobile phones , security experts have warned			2
many flashlight apps which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information			2
this may include the location of the phone , details of its owner and their contacts , and even the content of text messages			0
the data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user ’s shopping habits , experts claim			0
but it is also suspected that criminal gangs , hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts			2
the most popular flashlight apps for @entity2 smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times			1
they include the @entity140 , the @entity141 and the @entity142 + led			0
but few customers realise that many programs have capabilities far beyond switching on the phone ’s light , according to @entity7 cyber-security firm @entity149 , whose founder @entity150 has advised the @entity7 government			0
the study used a permission manager for @entity2 4.3 called @entity70			2
during the first week of the study , app behaviour data was collected for 23 people as they used their own @entity2 mobile devices			1
in the second week , they were given access to @entity70 , and in the third and final phase they received the daily privacy nudges detailing the frequency at which their sensitive information was accessed by their apps			0
the researchers found that app permission managers were helpful			0
when the participants were given access to @entity70 , they collectively reviewed their app permissions 51 times and restricted 272 permissions on 76 distinct apps			2
only one participant failed to review permissions			0
but once the participants had set their preferences over the first few days , they stopped making changes			0
when they began getting the privacy nudges , however , they went back to their privacy settings and further restricted many of them			0
during this phase , which spanned eight days , users collectively reviewed permissions 69 times , blocking 122 additional permissions on 47 apps			1
' app permission managers are better than nothing , but by themselves they are n't sufficient , ' @entity90 said			0
' the fact that users respond to privacy nudges indicate that they really care about privacy , but were just unaware of how much information was being collected about them			0
' the @entity70 software was discontinued on later versions of @entity2			2
while iphones do have a privacy manager , it does not tell users how often their information is used or for what purpose .			0

some apps for @entity2 are tracking movements every three minute
this means they collect location data roughly 6,200 times over two weeks
most smartphone users have no idea how closely they are being tracked
