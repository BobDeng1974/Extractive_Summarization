contradicts beliefs : a new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people 's moods it 's long been the belief that rainy days have a dampening effect on people 's moods			1
but a new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people 's happiness or sadness - meaning we 're just as content with the odd downpour as we are with blue skies			1
the research , which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun is shining , will come as a surprise to most weather - obsessed @entity26			1
the study was conducted by @entity29 , principal research fellow at the @entity30 , who monitored weather records with people 's happiness			1
mr @entity29 merged daily weather data from the @entity36 with individual level wellbeing data culled from the @entity38 between 1991 and 2008 and found no evidence that the often assumed relationship between sunshine and happiness existed			1
speaking to the @entity43 today , he said : ' i found it quite surprising that nobody had done any work on this in the @entity49			2
' i always hear people talk about the weather and that they are happy that the day is sunny instead of cloudy			1
i myself am one of such people ! ' i decided to take a look and my initial assumption was that there would be an effect and quite a strong one			2
good weather equals better mood			2
' however , this did n't turn out to be true			0
there are some weak effects in a naive correlation framework but when we go to a more complex multivariate framework ( i.e. we control for certain factors such as age , sex , location , etc ) all this disappears			0
the research , which will be presented by the @entity74 next week , searched for correlations between happiness and temperature , sunshine , rainfall and wind speed			2
the research , which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun 's shining , will come as a surprise to most weather - obsessed @entity26			1
above , sunbathers enjoy @entity88 in @entity90 heat last week the study was conducted by @entity29 , above , principal research fellow at the @entity30 he added : ' the end result is that - much to my surprise - the effect of the weather on people 's well - being is non-existent			1
' perhaps this is not surprising - when somebody asks you a question such as a ) how do you rate your current well - being on a scale of 1 to 10 should weather really â€‹ influence your answer ? up to one in four @entity49 suffer from seasonal affective disorder , with seven per cent of the population having full - blown sad			2
@entity107 is also know as the ' winter blues ' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into @entity113			0
in diagnosed cases , the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships			2
the effects vary from mild - tiredness during the day and over-eating - to very serious , such as joint pains , stomach upsets , loss of libido and even aggressive behaviour			2
@entity107 is triggered by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus , the part of the brain that rules our body 's main functions , such as sleep , appetite , sex drive , temperature , mood and activity			0
when the days are long , natural light passes through the eye to the retina until it reaches the hypothalamus and stimulates these natural functions			0
but if there is insufficient light , they begin to slow down and gradually stop - similar to a car running out of fuel			0
in recent years , however , there has been growing evidence that there are many ways to reduce the chances of developing sad or even to prevent it			0
' people 's well - being is driven by life events such as income , employment , health , family , death of a loved one , winning in the lottery , etc. ' it seems we are all smart enough not to be influenced by a bit of rain ! ' what mr @entity29 's paper did assert is that people 's job satisfaction is negatively impacted on sunny days			1
the paper makes a clear distinction between daily weather and seasons			1
mr @entity29 did find significant evidence of seasonal affective disorder ( @entity107 ) whereby individuals become markedly less happy during the winter because of a lack of light			0
@entity107 is also know as the ' winter blues ' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into @entity113			0
in diagnosed cases , the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships			0
he added : ' one other thing to keep in mind , the paper talks about and short run weather variations ( i.e. 5 days of rain type stuff )			1
there is quite strong evidence that we all feel a bit unhappier in the winter			0
' mr @entity29 's findings may be seen as unimportant but levels of well - being are becoming a focus for the @entity210			1
the research fellow suggested that a future line of inquiry could be a study into extreme weather			1
he added : ' the top five hottest years ever have all been in the last 10 to 15 years			0
' quite extreme weather patterns are starting to appear			0
there is an interesting question about what the effect of this will be			0

study was carried out by a research fellow at the @entity30
@entity36 data merged with well - being levels taken in household survey
found daily weather variations had little impact on happiness and sadness
but sunny days did have a negative impact on people 's job satisfaction
