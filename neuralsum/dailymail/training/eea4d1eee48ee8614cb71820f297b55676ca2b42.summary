by @entity0 @entity1 insists he has no intention of acting as understudy to @entity4 and @entity5 after finally winning back his @entity7 place			1
the @entity9 goalkeeper saw his two - year injury nightmare finally come to an end this summer when he signed for the @entity12			1
and the 40 - cap stopper was handed an immediate recall to the @entity15 set - up when @entity17 boss @entity16 named him in his squad for sunday 's opening @entity20 qualifier with @entity21			1
ambition : @entity1 is fighting for a starting spot after the @entity9 keeper was recalled to the @entity7 squad the 31 - year - old , however , is at the back of the queue to face the new world champions in @entity30 as @entity31 's @entity4 and @entity5 of @entity32 battle it out to be the nation 's number one			1
but former @entity35 and @entity36 keeper @entity1 is determined to make up for lost time and force his way back into a @entity7 jersey			1
he told the @entity40 : ' it 's good competition ( with @entity4 and @entity5 ) and i enjoy meeting up with the squad			1
competition : @entity1 is up against @entity4 and @entity5 for a starting spot in goal ' the standard of training among the keepers is fantastic			1
it 's been great to be involved in it and it improves my game as well			0
' the next stage is to go there and try to show up well in training and demonstrate that i 'm more than capable of holding my own and pushing for a start			0
' i do n't want to just go along there looking to make up the numbers now that i have been included in the squad			0
' i want to put pressure on the other two goalkeepers and try to force myself into contention for a starting spot			0
' i wanted to get back in as soon as possible and ( the @entity21 game ) was the very first opportunity			2
i had n't set myself a goal to try and be in this squad			0
i wanted to get back in however long it took			0
' now that i have managed to get called up the next goal is to force myself on the park and getting a game			0
' @entity1 is @entity9 's new first - choice stopper after @entity74 @entity73 sealed a £ 10million switch to @entity76			1
but he admits his recall to the @entity7 squad - which will be without @entity80 's @entity79 after the defender withdrew through injury - has come earlier than he thought possible			1
' it was a nice to be called back into the squad , ' he said			0
' i was n't totally expecting it as i thought it might be a bit early as i have only played a few games but , nevertheless , i have done well enough in those few games to show i am back at a level that could be considered for the @entity7 squad			2
' @entity16 's men will have the chance to emulate the famous 1967 team - which included @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 - that defeated @entity97 at @entity98 if they can become the first side to topple the @entity101 winners on sunday			1
@entity21 boss @entity102 , however , is without former skipper @entity103 , record - breaking frontman @entity104 and @entity106 defender @entity105 after the trio retired following their triumph in @entity110			2
depleted : @entity101 winning coach @entity102 will be without key players when they take on @entity7 @entity1 said : ' it 's a fantastic opportunity to become the unofficial world champions - we have previous for that , beating the @entity101 winners straight after the tournament , and hopefully it will be a chance for us to do the same			1
' it will be difficult as @entity21 will want to put on a big show for all their fans after coming back from the @entity101			2
' there will be a few new faces to come into their side and a few will have retired , so there will be a few changes there			0
' it probably wo n't cause them too many problems as they have such great strength in depth but it could be something for us to hold on to ' they have had a pretty settled squad for the last wee while so it will give us a chance to go over there and acquit ourselves well			0
' @entity79 , meanwhile , has been forced to pull out of @entity16 's group after sustaining a knee injury in the @entity80 ' 1 - 1 draw at @entity146 on saturday			2
@entity16 has already called up @entity148 's @entity147 as cover after @entity79 was kept behind by @entity80 's medical team for further treatment			0
it 's not too late to play @entity153 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity1 was recalled to @entity7 for their match against @entity21
the @entity9 keeper has 40 caps but is behind @entity4 and @entity5 in the national team 's pecking order after returning to the set - up
@entity7 face @entity101 winning team weakened by injury and retirements
@entity7 could *repeat* the feat of 1967 when they beat @entity101 winners @entity97 at @entity98
