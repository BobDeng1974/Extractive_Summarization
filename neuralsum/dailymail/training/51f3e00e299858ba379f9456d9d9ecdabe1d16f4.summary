by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 21 october 2013 a satellite that can spot asteroids on collision course with our planet which previously could not be seen due to their close proximity to the sun is to be launched into space next month			1
until now , astronomers have not been able to see asteroids that orbit between @entity13 and the sun as powerful radiation from the latter blinds telescopes on earth			1
one such orbit hit the @entity13 in february - smashing into the @entity20 town of @entity21 , almost 1000 miles east of @entity22			1
a satellite which can spot asteroids in orbit between the sun and @entity13 will be launched into space next month by the @entity28 however , the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is soon to launch its @entity30 space satellite - and one of its missions will be to track these previously unseen asteroids			1
the £ 800m probe will sit in orbit 90million miles from @entity13			2
@entity36 , a professor of experimental philosophy at @entity39 ’s @entity38 , who is a lead scientist on the project told @entity42 : ' @entity30 will measure all the asteroids including those between us and the sun which are the really nasty ones because we can not see them			2
' however , the main goal of the @entity30 mission is to make a precise three - dimensional map of our galaxy - the @entity51			1
it will do so by photographing and surveying around one per cent of the galaxy 's 100 billion stars			0
during the mapping , @entity30 - which is so powerful it can spot a button on the moon - will detect and accurately measure the motion of each star in its orbit around the centre of the @entity64			2
it is hoped that by creating a detailed map of the stars , the probe will provide a tool to help scientists study the formation of the @entity51			2
one of the dangerous ' unseen ' asteroids crashed 900 miles east of @entity22 in february this year those behind the probe hope that @entity30 will make other discoveries during its five - year lifetime , including planets around other stars , icy bodies in the outer @entity81 and even far - distant supernovae			1
@entity36 added : ' @entity30 will follow a billion stars for five or six years , plotting their movements 80 times so that we can work out their exact tracks			0
' earlier this week , @entity88 issued a ' reality check ' on news that an asteroid could hit @entity13 on august 26 , 2032			0
the @entity92 found the massive asteroid , called 2013 @entity94 , last weekend			0
the international scientific community has already rated it as one of the two most dangerous asteroids ever recorded			0
but @entity88 said that the probability of an @entity13 impact is only one in @entity102 means astronomers are 99.9984 per cent certain that it will miss @entity13 's orbit			0
the @entity30 satellite will also map our galaxy - the @entity51 , pictured above in near infra - red light the @entity13 has frequently been hit by asteroids - with perhaps the most famous being the impact 65m years ago that is thought to have contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs			1
another best - known hit was in 1908 when a small asteroid exploded above @entity115 with the force of a nuclear bomb			0
geologists have also found hundreds of craters from smaller impacts , including one under what is now the @entity122 .			0

astronomers have been unable to spot asteroids in orbit between the earth and the sun due to powerful radiation from the latter
@entity30 satellite , which will launch next month , will act as an early *warning* *system* for such asteroids - one of which hit @entity20 in february this year
powerful probe will also map the @entity51 in *unprecedented* detail
