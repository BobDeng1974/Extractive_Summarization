men who take part in violent conflicts are more likely to father more children , researchers have found			1
researchers at @entity7 studied a small tribal populations in eastern @entity9 - and found violent conflict does result in more wives and children for certain warriors			1
they studied the @entity14 , a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest @entity18 and @entity19			2
researchers studied the @entity14 , a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest @entity18 and @entity19 , who frequently carry out violent raids on neighbouring groups armed with weapons like @entity27 rifles ( pictured )			1

the @entity14 , are a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest @entity18 and @entity19			0
they number approximately 30,000,and have intermittent conflict with many of their neighbors , especially the @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 they carry out violent raids on neighboring groups			1
typically carried out by @entity14 men between 20 and 40 years old armed with weapons like @entity27 rifles , the raids sometimes result in serious injuries and deaths			0
the study , authored by @entity50 of the @entity51 , found that , among members of the @entity58 herding tribe , those who engaged in conflict - in the form of violent raids carried out on neighbouring groups - had more wives , and thus more opportunities to increase their reproductive success through having more children			1
the study , published in the @entity65 , provided clear evidence that violence offers a benefit to warriors , the team say			2
' the currency of evolution is reproductive success , ' @entity50 said			0
' by having more wives you can have more children			1
' what we found was that , over the course of their lives , those who took part in more raids had more children			1
' importantly , though , that benefit - the increased reproductive success enjoyed by raiders - is mediated by powerful cultural forces , @entity50 said			0
' what i really like about this paper is the finding is n't just ' biology made me do it , '' he said			0
' it 's very clear what the pathway to greater reproductive success is - it 's access to livestock , which are obtained through raiding and then used for marriage			0
' but the cultural mechanism is mediated by the elders who control virtually all aspects of the society			0
' after a raid young men give any livestock they capture to the elders and the raider can not use them at that point even if he wants to get married			0
' later in life , as the raider gets older he can gain access to them , so there 's a lag in receiving benefits from participating in a raid			0
' examining the connection between violence and reproductive capacity , however , is no easy feat. @entity50 lived with the @entity14 , a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest @entity18 and @entity19 , for more than a year , and observing virtually every part of day - to - day village life - from digging water holes to migrations			0

those who take part in the raids , however , must turn over any livestock they obtain to village elders , who use them to obtain wives for themselves			2
it may not be until years later that elders agree to provide a raider with the cows necessary to obtain their first wife , or subsequent wives			2
' in many cultures , particularly in east @entity9 , in order to get married you have to give livestock to the bride 's family - we refer to it as bridewealth , ' @entity50 said			1
' if you do n't have cows , you simply can not get married - it does n't matter how handsome you are or how much status you have , if you do n't have cows to give the bride 's family , you can not get married			0
' though he found clear evidence that violence offers a benefit to warriors , @entity50 's over-riding interest is in a much larger question			1
' i conducted interviews about the raids , and collected reproductive histories by asking how many wives raiders have , how many children each has had , how many are alive , how many died and how they died			1
' researchers conducted interviews about the raids , and collected reproductive histories by asking how many wives raiders have , how many children each has had , how many are alive , how many died and how they died			1
' using that data , @entity50 was able to build conflict histories for the young men that took part in raids and village elders detailing who participated in raids , how often they participated , whether they were married and the number of wives and children they had			1
in an analysis of 120 men , @entity50 said , the data was clear - those who participate in more raids had more wives and more children over the course of their lives			2

but while raiders did benefit from taking part in conflict , the lack of an immediate payoff , @entity50 believes , helps to keep violence in check			2
' we do n't have quantitative data to that effect , but there are some groups in neighboring @entity231 where raiders who capture cows in a raid do n't have to give them to the elders or they can sell them at a market for money , and the violence is significantly greater ' he said			0
' the @entity14 have a mechanism that mediates the benefits the warriors receive , ' he added			2
' there is a lot of status and privilege that comes with participating in raids - when you come back to the village , the women are singing and people are parading			0
' they 're celebrating you , but you still go home alone			0
