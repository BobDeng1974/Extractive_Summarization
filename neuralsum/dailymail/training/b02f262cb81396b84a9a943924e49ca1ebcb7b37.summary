by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 01:54 est , 10 december 2013 it may look like an aerial shot from a post-apocalyptic film , but this new map shows how @entity7 could look if sea levels continue to rise and the @entity9 was n’t there to protect it			1
released by the @entity12 , the map highlights what would happen if the capital was hit by ' severe ' tidal surges			1
parts of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are all shown completely submerged with only a handful of spots across the floodplain escaping the flooding			1
parts of @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20 are shown under water melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century , according to academics from the @entity36 programme , the @entity38 and @entity37			1
they claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the @entity44 coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of climate change			0
if such rises were to take place , @entity7 ’s current sea defences would struggle to cope , with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade last week storms hit parts of the @entity44 causing the largest tidal surges in 60 years			1
around 1,400 homes were said to have been flooded , including 300 in worst - affected @entity56			0
however , many properties in @entity7 were protected due to the @entity9 - a 520m - long flood defence system near @entity59 in east @entity7			1
the movable barrier is made up of 10 gates attached to 39 - metre tall cofferdam piles , which are buried 24 metres into the river bed			2
individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely			0
the @entity9 , pictured , was opened in 1982 and is a 520m - long flood defence system near @entity59 in east @entity7			1
individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely			0
the barrier can hold back up to 9,000 tonnes of water in anticipation of last week ’s storms , the @entity9 was closed on thursday and friday to prevent surges flooding the capital			1
when fully raised , the barrier creates a solid steel wall preventing water flowing upstream towards the capital			2
the four main gates span 61 metres and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each			0
each gate is 20 metres high and can hold back loads of up to 9,000 tonnes			0
according to the @entity12 , @entity7 is vulnerable to flooding and high tides from surges travelling down from the @entity85 towards the @entity86 and @entity87			2
in 1928 fourteen people were said to have died after flooding on the @entity9 , a further 307 died during the @entity89 and this led to the barrier being built in the late 70s before being opening in 1982			2
it costs in excess of £ 16,000 each time to fully close the @entity9 but it is regularly tested and closed during high spring tides			2
the @entity9 is the main defence against flooding for @entity7 and cover a 520 metre section of the @entity9 near @entity59			1
the @entity9 has two types of gates : falling @entity101 that sit above the river and @entity103 which rest on the river bed			2
individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes around an house and a half to close completely			0
when fully raised , the barrier creates a solid steel wall that stops water flowing upstream towards the capital			0
the four main gates span 61 metres and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each			0
each gate is 20 metres high and can hold around 9,000 tonnes of flowing water			0
the @entity9 is only be reopened once the water level upstream of the barrier matches the level downstream			1
once a decision has been made to reopen it , a controlled amount of water is passed under the gate and up the @entity122 .			0

new map shows how @entity7 would have looked following *‘* severe floods ’
parts of @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20 are shown under water
it highlights how much water the @entity9 is capable of blocking
the barrier is second largest movable flood defence system in the world
