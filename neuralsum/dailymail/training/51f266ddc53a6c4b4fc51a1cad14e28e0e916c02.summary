by @entity0 a cemetery in @entity2 has become the first in @entity4 to turn to so - called ' ready - made ' plastic graves after it ran out of room to bury to dead			1
@entity8 was forced to turn away funerals after it used up all of the suitable land allotted for burials			1
it is problem that has being felt around the country , with warnings earlier this year of a national shortage in grave space			0
but an experimental new scheme that could now be used in cemeteries all over @entity4 has seen pre-dug graves constructed out of plastic			1
workers install ready - made graves in @entity2 after a cemetery ran out of room for more burials the local council hopes the new system will stop graves subsiding in land previously thought too sandy the move came after the cemetery ran out of the space to dig new graves and nearby land was considered too sandy to house long - lasting burial places			1
the local council has now installed large plastic walls to create plots where coffins can be placed without the risk of subsidence			2
new graves are made by digging a plot much larger than the standard burial with room for 12 bodies			2
a giant frame is then put in place with walls installed on the frame to create individual plots measuring 9ft by 4ft			2
the plot is then refilled , leaving one space unfilled ready for the next burial			0
if more plots can be added on to the frame if required at a later date without disturbing those already resting			0
the first plot was used for the burial of a man last friday			0
the area dug up was later covered , leaving pre-made graves , one of which has already been used it is thought the scheme , which uses plastic frames like those pictured , may now be used around the country while the installation does increase the cost of digging the graves , the council insists it saves money in the long term and increases the amount of available space threefold			1
a spokesperson for @entity80 said they believed they were the first in the country to experiment with the new grave system			0
the burial system could be rolled out to help extend the life of the other cemeteries , the spokesperson said			0
local councillor @entity88 said : ' this gives the chance for those who would like their loved ones to be buried in this cemetery - something they may not have thought possible			0
' in may this year , mps warned that growing pressures on land for development and farming has left many local councils struggling to find space for burial sites			2
like many cemeteries around @entity4 , @entity8 was running out of room to bury the dead other cemeteries have built concrete chambers but this is the first time cheaper plastic has been used			1

like many cemeteries , resting place in @entity2 was running out of room
the only land left was considered *unsuitable* because it was too sandy
but experimental new scheme has seen plastic frames put in ground
it is hoped the new idea will open up more areas for burials and graves
