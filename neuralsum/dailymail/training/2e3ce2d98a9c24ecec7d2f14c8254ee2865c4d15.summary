by @entity0 for @entity1 peeping @entity2 who ogle women in their most - intimate bathroom moments need no longer worry about the consequences in the hereafter - at least , according to one surprising spiritual authority			0
a hardline @entity9 preacher from @entity10 this week made waves in the @entity12 after he issued a religious edict allowing a man to watch a woman ' while she is showering '			1
but there is a catch , which is that such voyeurism is only acceptable ' as long as your intentions are pure '			0
go forth and ogle ! @entity10 cleric @entity21 has controversially ruled that it 's alright by @entity23 for men to spy on women who are taking a shower - as long as they intend to marry her at some point later what are you doing up there ? peeping @entity2 can secretly watch women in the shower , as long as they do their ogling with ' pure ' intentions @entity36 preacher @entity21 made the controversial fatwa in a recent sermon			1
his opinion , based on his own , apparently rather special , interpretation of @entity9 , is that men can ' hide ' somewhere ' in secret ' in order to see parts of your intended bride ' she would n't usually let you see '			2
the edict appears to run counter to traditional @entity9 teachings , which encourage both men and women dress modestly and ' lower their gaze ' when faced with members of the opposite sex			1
mr @entity56 's sermon was broadcast on @entity10 - based @entity57 , and they have been translated into @entity58 by @entity59			1
he is a representative of the @entity36 movement , a minority strain in @entity10 islam , which encourages believers to look back to the earliest @entity64 as the epitome of good religious practice			1
he said : ' if you were really honest and wanted to marry that woman , and you were able to hide and watch her in secret , see the things that she would n’t usually let you see before marrying her , then it is acceptable as long as your intentions are pure			0
' one of the @entity76 ’s companions did that			0
some disapproved and told him : " how do you do that when you ’re one of the @entity76 ’s companions ? " fatwa : his opinion , based on his own , apparently rather special , interpretation of @entity9 , is that men can ' hide ' somewhere ' in secret ' in order to see parts of your intended bride ' she would n't usually let you see ' ' @entity91 answered : " if you can see something that would make you want to marry her then go ahead and do it			2
" ' @entity10 's minister of religion , @entity96 , moved quickly to reject the fatwa			1
' where is the glory and masculinity in watching a woman shower ? ' he was quoted as saying by @entity103 , a @entity104 - based @entity58 news network			0
' would you allow this to happen to your daughter ? if it was ok with you then it is n’t with the conservative , civilized @entity9 and @entity111 societies – they disapprove of it			0
' besides , @entity9 preaches that modesty should be in our nature and all religions concur			2

@entity36 preacher @entity21 offers surprising fatwa during sermon
it appears to run counter to traditional @entity9 teachings on modesty
@entity10 's religions minister moves quickly to *condemn* the shock edict
