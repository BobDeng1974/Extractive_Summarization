by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 13 february 2013 a holidaymaker has been reunited with a lost @entity3 memory card containing 300 pictures of her backpacking adventure - after an internet campaign to track her down			1
@entity7 , 22 , thought the digital pictures of her summer trip around @entity10 with friend @entity11 , 23 , had gone forever when she lost the camera card in a bar in @entity14 last july			1
but the miniature card , measuring just half an inch across , was later found by @entity18 advertising agency boss @entity17 on a baggage belt at @entity14 's @entity14			1
lost : @entity7 in one of her holiday photos which she thought had been lost forever after leaving her camera memory card in a bar he looked at the pictures on the card to see if there were any clues to identify the owner and saw that they showed two young women travelling around @entity10			1
mr @entity17 launched a social media campaign to try to track down the mystery women so he could return their snaps to them			1
he put a selection of the pictures on @entity36 in a video montage called ' who 's that girl ? ' and posted links to it on @entity41 and @entity42			2
his 24 second video ended up being viewed 33,500 times after the story of his search was picked up by @entity18 newspapers and radio stations			0
memories : @entity7 and her friend @entity11 , pictured right , had taken photos of their travels through @entity53 in @entity54 and @entity55 on the @entity57 coast of @entity58 before heading to @entity14 finally a friend of @entity60 and miss @entity11 who lives in @entity14 saw the @entity36 posting and realised the pictures were of them			1
the two young women from @entity65 , @entity66 , have now made contact with mr @entity17 who has emailed them all the pictures - six months after they lost them			2
holiday snap : @entity7 and @entity11 , pictured right , lost the camera card in an @entity14 bar miss @entity7 who is currently working as an assistant in a ski shop in @entity58 said she was ' ecstatic and in shock ' to get the pictures back			1
she said : ' it is absolutely bizarre			0
we were convinced they had gone for ever			0
' we are truly grateful to @entity17 for going to so much effort to track us down			0
the pictures hold so many amazing memories for us			0
' miss @entity7 said the 300 pictures were taken in the first few weeks of a three month backpacking trip that her and @entity11 were taking around @entity10 last summer			1
most of the snaps showed the pair enjoying the sights around @entity53 in the @entity92 region of @entity54 and @entity55 on the @entity57 coast of @entity58 before they travelled to @entity14			0
miss @entity7 said : ' we were in a bar by a canal in @entity14 when i realised my memory card was full as i had been taking pictures all day			1
' @entity11 had a spare card in her glasses case so we quickly exchanged the cards , but a little while later we realised the full one had gone missing			0
' we went back to the bar and were pulling cushions off chairs to try and find it , but it was nowhere to be seen			0
' afterwards we just bought another card and got on with our travelling			0
it was just annoying because i had lost all the pictures from the early part of our trip			0
campaign : the card was found on the baggage belt of @entity14 airport by @entity119 who began a social media campaign to find the owner ' it came as a complete surprise when we were contacted by the friend who we were staying with in @entity14 who told us our pictures had turned up on @entity36			1
reunited : @entity7 and @entity11 , pictured left , eventually contacted mr @entity17 after seeing a @entity36 video and he emailed them the pictures ' we were amazed to hear that the sd card had landed up on a conveyor belt at the airport several miles from @entity14 city centre			1
' how it got there from the bar is an absolute mystery			0
' when i briefly spoke to @entity17 on a @entity18 radio station , he was quite apologetic for not putting the pictures online sooner			2
' miss @entity11 , a media and broadcasting technology student at @entity145 , said : ' we do n't know how the memory card got to the airport			2
' we went back to the bar where we lost it on more than one occasion but eventually gave up hope			0
' that was last summer - but then i got a call saying there was a big campaign launched to find us			2
' i could n't believe it			0
' mr @entity17 , creative business partner at @entity18 advertising agency etcetera , said : ' it 's amazing how fast news travels on @entity41			2
' it 's really the new ' lost and found '			2
' that 's why i decided to put it on @entity41 and @entity36 instead of bringing the card to the lost and found - department of @entity14			1

@entity7 , 22 , lost her camera card in an @entity14 bar last july
she thought she had lost her pictures of travelling around @entity10 forever
but @entity119 found the tiny memory card at @entity14 airport
