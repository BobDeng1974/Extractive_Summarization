by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 18:06 est , 18 march 2013 parents who give their toddlers skimmed milk to prevent them gaining weight may be wasting their time , researchers say			1
a study found that two - year - olds who drank full - fat milk put on fewer pounds by the age of four than those on low - fat			1
academics believe this is because higher fat milk makes children feel fuller for longer , and they eat less as a result			0
unhelpful : skimmed milk might not make children feel as full as whole milk , resulting in them eating more overall ( posed by model ) the @entity22 study concluded that the type of milk given to children ‘ may not matter that much ’ despite fears the obesity epidemic is being fuelled by diets high in fat			2
researchers at the @entity31 found two - year - olds who drank mainly low - fat and skimmed milk were 57 per cent more likely to become overweight by the age of four			1
but the average weight of children drinking full - fat milk was lower over the same period			0
professor @entity39 , who led the research , said : ‘ we assumed the study would show that children drinking low - fat and skimmed milk would be helped to keep their weight down , but this was not the case			2
‘ if you are going to drink milk , and we strongly back the importance of drinking milk at a young age , it does n’t seem to matter that much which type it is			0
’ obesity epidemic : researchers found that two - year - olds who drank mainly low - fat and skimmed milk were actually more likely to be overweight by four - years - old in the @entity22 , the @entity62 and the @entity63 recommend all children drink low - fat or skimmed milk after the age of two to ward off obesity			1
in contrast , @entity70 children under five are not advised to drink skimmed milk – which has virtually all the fat removed – because they need the extra energy for growth			1
the @entity22 study asked 11,000 parents what type of milk their children drank at aged two and four : skimmed ; one per cent semi-skimmed ; two per cent milk fat ; full - fat , or soy			2
the children were also weighed and measured at both ages – with around one in three being overweight or obese at both time points , says a report published online in the @entity88			0
healthier : @entity70 children under five are not advised to drink skimmed milk because whole milk helps them grow at that critical stage heavier children were more likely to drink skimmed and semi-skimmed milk , with 14 per cent of heavy two - year - olds and 16 per cent of heavy four - year - olds drinking it , compared with nine per cent of normal weight two - year - olds and 13 per cent of normal weight four - year - olds			1
professor @entity39 said parents may be acting from the best motives by choosing low - fat milks , but milk fat may increase a feeling of fullness so reduce the appetite for other high calorie foods			0
he said : ‘ physicians do n’t have much time to advise parents worried about their children putting on weight , so they may be better off sticking to advice we know works			0
‘ this includes cutting down on tv watching and sugary drinks , and increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable intake			0
