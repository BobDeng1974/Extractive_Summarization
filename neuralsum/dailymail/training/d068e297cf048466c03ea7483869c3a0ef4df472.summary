by @entity0 follow @ @ adamjshergold it was one of the finest goals seen at a @entity3 , the perfect combination of audacity and breath - taking technique			1
glancing over his shoulder to check the positioning of @entity11 goalkeeper @entity10 , @entity7 cushioned the ball expertly on his chest and , in one smooth , elegant movement , dispatched an immaculate volley that crashed in off the bar			1
if you did n't know of @entity18 of @entity19 before , you certainly do now			0
his thunderbolt setting @entity19 on the way to a quarter - final meeting with hosts @entity23 and putting him top of the goalscoring charts with five in four games			2
despite being just 22 , he has a well - honed free - kick technique - take , for example , the 30 - yarder he stuck away for @entity19 in their come - from - behind 3 - 1 win against @entity52 in qualification for @entity23 2014			1
there was also his debut goal for @entity56 against @entity57 in november last year , a beautifully flighted free - kick into the far corner that started to repay the Â £ 38.5m @entity56 paid @entity60 for him the previous summer			1
@entity7 spent three seasons at the @entity64 giants , scoring 32 goals and contributing 21 assists in 105 appearances			2
his time was marked with three @entity64 titles , a @entity70 and the @entity71 in 2011			0
there is such beauty and promise in some of the goals he scored there , from deft chips over an advancing goalkeeper to shifting his body weight to deceive defenders before slotting home			0
highlights included a well - judged lob at @entity85 in september 2012 that dropped in over the heads of two defenders and the goalkeeper , a sublime one - two and finish into the top corner to draw @entity60 level against rivals @entity91 and a late curled winner on the left foot to beat @entity94 in the @entity95 ( see next video )			2
it was also soon clear that @entity7 had the ability to control matches - he was composed in possession and always knew where his team - mates stood			0
whether the pass was long - range or short , @entity7 was able to find someone in the same colours , while he excelled too at crossing and direct running			0
@entity7 has been scoring lovely goals on the @entity109 scene for some time - and with @entity111 club @entity110 beforehand - but now his presence is truly global			1
with offers likely to flood in from leading clubs in the @entity115 and @entity116 , @entity7 could soon be bringing such exceptional abilities to an even loftier level			1
and finally ... a teenage @entity7 scores directly from a corner			0

22 - year - old @entity7 scored goal of the @entity3 so far as @entity19 beat @entity11
*increased* *tournament* goal tally to five , ahead of @entity124 and @entity125
@entity7 has scored many fine goals for @entity110 , @entity60 and @entity56
@entity3 *performances* likely to *enhance* *interest* from @entity115 and @entity116 clubs
