@entity2 shoppers have fallen out of love with the big name supermarkets , cutting their spending and switching to cheaper rivals , a new study reveals			1
since the start of this year total spending in supermarkets has been flat , after a decade of rising prices fuelling strong growth			1
it comes as @entity13 reported a catastrophic slump in pre-tax profits , down 91 per cent in six months , as large retailers struggle to compete with the emergence of discount stores like @entity19 and @entity13			1
while the amount people in @entity2 buy has risen steadily this year , the quantity of goods bought in supermarkets has remained flat the @entity24 today published new research on spending in ‘ ‘ non-specialised food stores ’ , which are dominated by supermarkets			1
it found that rapid growth in the amount shoppers spent in supermarkets over several years came to an abrupt halt at the end of 2013			1
since then there has been almost no change in the amount of money rung through supermarket tills			2
by contrast , spending across the retails sector , covering every kind of shop , has risen steadily			0
the amount of shopping in the nation ’s trolleys has also remained unchanged			2
figures the quantity of supermarket purchases has been flat throughout the decade			2
supermarkets have seen a greater increase in the amount spent , but a smaller one in quantity bought			1
however supermarket prices have actually fallen in 2014			2
the @entity24 said : ‘ one cause of this may be increased price competition amongst supermarkets , caused by an increasing market share for discount supermarket chains and discounting			1
‘ another suggested cause could be the falling cost of food production , resulting from falling wheat prices			0
‘ regardless , it is clear that the change in pattern in supermarket spending reflects a clear change in pricing environment ; demand has been essentially flat for significantly longer than spending			0
’ total spending in supermarkets has also remained flat , as shoppers switch to cheaper alternatives millions of customers have switched to budget chains like @entity19 and @entity83 or high - end @entity84 and @entity85			1
@entity13 , which was once king of the supermarkets , is now in crisis after failing to deliver on price , service or quality			1
chairman sir @entity92 quit this morning after the most disastrous six months in the supermarket 's 95 - year history			1
@entity13 in crisis : chairman @entity92 quit today after a disastrous drop in profits , being branded its worst results in its 95 - year history @entity2 's biggest retailer said its pre-tax profits in the six months to august have plunged 91.9 per cent to £ 112million , compared to £ 1.3billion a year earlier			1
however , other parts of the high street are also struggling			0
latest retail figures released today show retail sales fell last month as unseasonably warm weather meant that shoppers delayed buying new coats and jumpers			2
store sales volumes fell by 0.3 per cent in september compared to the month before , according to the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			0
the worst performers last month came from clothing , textile and footwear sales which fell 7.8 per cent compared to august , and 4.1 per cent over the year			0
but taken over a 12 - month period sales volumes rose 2.7 per cent in september , the 18th consecutive month of year - on - year growth , the longest sustained period of expansion since may 2008			0
the @entity24 added that average store prices fell by 1.4 per cent compared to last year , the largest fall since july 2009			0
the biggest drivers were petrol price cuts , which were down 5.4 per cent over the year , while the ongoing supermarket price war saw prices fall 0.3 per cent , the biggest drop since december 2004			0
overall retail sales volumes rose just 0.3 per cent quarter - on - quarter in the third quarter of the year , down markedly from growth of 1.5 per cent quarter - on - quarter in the second quarter			2
many economists believe that the moderation in consumer spending in the third quarter will contribute to a slowing in gross domestic product ( gdp )			0
@entity138 chief @entity2 economist @entity137 said : " it does look like consumers have reined in their spending to some degree after splashing out at a strong rate overall through the first half of the year			0
" this is not that surprising given the overall pressure coming on consumers ' purchasing power from prolonged very weak earnings growth			0

total amount spent in supermarkets flat since the start of 2014
price - *conscious* shoppers switching to discount stores like @entity19 and @entity83
quantity of goods bought in supermarkets also flat while retail rises
@entity13 chairman @entity92 resigns after 91 *%* slump in profits
