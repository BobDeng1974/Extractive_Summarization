by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 15 october 2013 the heartbroken parents of a stillborn baby who died after a series of blunders had to grieve on a packed maternity ward because the hospital 's bereavement suite was being used for storage			1
@entity9 , 28 , had to endure the torment of delivering her lifeless child @entity11 naturally after hospital staff ignored a scan which revealed he was being starved of oxygen in the womb			1
a review into maternity services within @entity18 has now revealed that if he had been delivered just one day earlier by emergency caesarean , he would have survived			1
scandal : @entity9 , 28 , had to endure the torment of delivering her lifeless child @entity11 at @entity22 in @entity23 and then grieve surrounded by other mothers appallingly , @entity9 and husband @entity25 , 27 , were then left to recover on a ward alongside new mums because the bereavement suite was being used to store records - something the report describes as ' almost beyond belief '			1
@entity9 , who also has an eight - year - old son , said : ' i was in labour for 24 hours and for most of this time , we were left alone			2
i felt that the staff did n't want to face us and we were totally unsupported through the process			0
' this was the most horrendous experience of my life but to top it off , midwives said the only place available for me to recover was on the ward with all the new mums			2
' there was no way i could do it so we were sent home			0
' the couple of @entity48 , @entity49 , had struggled to conceive so were ' overjoyed ' when they found out she was pregnant with their second child			2
but she started suffering pains on @entity54 and visited @entity22 having not felt the baby move for some time			2
damning : a review of care at @entity18 found if @entity11 had been delivered a day earlier he would have survived staff carried out tests but put it down to @entity11 being a sleepy baby , despite @entity9 pointing out the fact he had always been very active			1
by 3 january 2012 @entity9 was still concerned so she and @entity25 went back to hospital - and only a faint heartbeat was detected			2
however , as @entity11 had not met the essential criteria on the monitor , @entity9 was referred through to the consultant - who failed to check the results that had been printed from the monitor and instead told the couple to return the following day			1
ms @entity9 said : ' after a student midwife and a senior midwife could not find a heartbeat , a doctor eventually came in and placed a scanner on my stomach and turned the screen to face us			2
' it was obvious our son 's heart was not beating			0
we asked whether our son was alive but no one would answer and a radiographer was then called in			0
' she took pictures on the scanner for five minutes			0
we were totally distraught by this point and finally she said , " i 'm sorry , he 's gone "			0
' we were in complete and utter disbelief			0
we had known for days that something was n't right but hospital staff made us feel that we were being a nuisance and tried to brush it all under the carpet			0
' it just breaks my heart to know that if @entity11 had been delivered by caesarean or even the day before when we saw the consultant , he 'd still be alive today but instead we felt we were ignored and dismissed because we were blocking up the @entity102 's clinic , which was the first clinic back after @entity103			1
' a review into maternity services within @entity18 following @entity11 's death revealed concerns about staff 's professional behaviour after a consultant was described as being unprofessional and rude in his approach with @entity9 and @entity25			1
it also found that midwives were afraid to question the consultant 's decisions when it was apparent the patient could be in danger and there was inadequate documentation			2
there was inadequate assessment of clinical information and although a fetal heart scan identified @entity11 's heartbeat as weak , it was not acted upon			1
finally , the investigation revealed a lack of skills in managing bereaved families and a lack of bereavement facilities			0
the couple are speaking out for the first time after experts at @entity136 secured an admission of liability from @entity18			0
the consultant is now being investigated by the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) and has restrictions on his practice			1
@entity143 , a specialist medical lawyer at @entity136 's @entity145 office who represents @entity9 and @entity25 said : ' this couple has been devastated by the loss of their son @entity11 and they understandably wanted answers about what went wrong			1
' whilst we welcome the fact that the @entity18 has admitted responsibility , we back the couple 's calls for proof from the trust that improvements have been made to maternity services to protect patient safety and prevent the same catalogue of failings being made again			1
' dr @entity164 , medical doctor at @entity18 , apologised and said they recognised failings in care			0
' we started an investigation immediately after these events with input from an independent clinician and we have already implemented changes as a result			0
' while sadly we can not change the outcome for @entity11 , we believe the steps we have taken will minimise the risk of a similar tragedy occurring in the future			0
