each year the @entity2 does its bit to help out holidaymakers when it comes to mobile charges when travelling abroad			1
but it seems we are still scared , if not unaware , of the costs we may incur while using our phones abroad			2
what is certain is that most holidaymakers are not making the most of their smartphones or tablets abroad despite over 70 per cent owning an @entity16 , @entity17 or similar devices , according to a recent study			2
a further 83 per cent either over or under - estimate how much it would cost to use their mobile devices , and only 30 per cent who understand the changes are more relaxed about undertaking internet searches as a result			1
a few adventurous souls have downloaded apps , videos or searched the internet on a snow - scooter in @entity46 , while walking the @entity47 , out in the @entity48 , or even in a @entity28 brothel			2
others have successfully scoured the web while diving off the @entity53 , scaling mountains , or on safari			0
seventy five per cent however stick to the hotel when it comes to looking things up online			2
many of us are still confused as to just what we will be charged for ' roaming ' while abroad the tariff is per @entity63 to download data or browse the internet whilst travelling abroad ( charged per @entity66 used )			1
as you can see , the amount is going down year on year			0
speaking to @entity69 , @entity70 , media relations manager at @entity72 , said : ' customers have to be aware that the roaming cap applies just to data , but it is within the whole @entity27			1
' this is set at € 50 , which was set by the @entity2 back in july 2012			1
once this amount has been reached , you then have to " opt in " to spending more than that amount			0
' when you arrive in another country in the @entity27 , you will get a text from a partner company to your network , which will explain what the charges are for calls and texts , as well as how much data costs			1
' it 's important to stress that the cap is only set on data			2
' once the cap has been reached , the cost per megabyte would be charged at 16p in the @entity27 plus @entity95			1
turn off push notifications in apps 2			0

connect to wifi @entity114 , managing director of @entity115 , the specialist property website that conducted the research , added : ' despite most of us taking our devices away with us , many are simply not taking advantage of adhoc events or amazing restaurant offers abroad , because of our lack of understanding and misperceptions about roaming charges			2
' @entity72 customers , for example , have to purchase a ' travel pass ' when they are in the @entity27 , which enables roaming			1
a 10mb travel pass costs £ 1.50 , a 50mb pass costs £ 6 and a @entity134 pass is £ 20			0
@entity72 also has a @entity136 service , which allows customers to use their home phone talk plans when they are abroad when connected to wifi			0
the new caps only apply when you use a mobile within the @entity27 , the rest of @entity140 is exempt			1
but statistics also show that just half of travellers realise the new rules are limited to @entity27 countries			1
@entity149 has researched the exact cost of using the most popular mobile apps outside the @entity27 and in the rest of the world			1
based on @entity156 data roaming charges , the results make for some scary reading			1
it costs 3p per megabyte of data roaming in @entity140 , but a whopping £ 6 in the rest of the world			1
based on a photo taken from an iphone 5 camera ( which has an average size of 2mb ) it would cost 76p to upload a photo onto @entity168 , @entity169 or @entity170			0
with the cap on data and more transparency with call and text calls , panic over your phone bill should be a thing of the past this estimate also does not include being on @entity168 itself , which would use data , especially if the user scrolls through friends ' status updates , which can be text , images or videos which all require data to load			1
@entity168 also now auto plays videos which can push the cost of browsing up further if this feature is n’t turned off			0
streaming a 30 - minute episode of a television programme abroad could cost up to £ 540 , the equivalent of a flight to @entity198 with @entity199			2
chatting to friends on @entity201 will set you back up to £ 12 and browsing the internet for 30 minutes could cost up to £ 60			2
@entity204 , gadget sector manager at @entity149 said : ‘ we are so accustomed to using our phones every day for entertainment , keeping up to date with news , and staying connected with friends : everyday apps we take for granted in the @entity211 , if used in the same way abroad , can rack up unexpected bills that can exceed the actual cost of a holiday			0
' we ’ve seen bills rack up into the thousands , so would advise on planning ahead to avoid a nasty surprise when you get back			0
' check data roaming charges with your provider , get prepared with a data bolt on or usage cap , or switch off data roaming on your phone altogether			1

there is a cap of € 50 ( £ *39* ) for data before users ' opt in '
calls and texts *differ* from network to network - but are also capped
60 per cent of *people* are unaware of changes to data roaming
mobile charges within @entity27 are getting lower year on year
but be wary - data cap limited to within the @entity27 only
