by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 17:32 est , 22 may 2012 a man , who is believed to be a 21 - year - old university student , has started a dangerous craze around @entity6 's campuses - downing bottles of alcohol as quickly as possible on camera			1
in a series of videos , which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times across the world , the man who is thought to study at the @entity10 , covers his face with a ski - mask to ' protect his identity			1
' he then completes various dangerous alcohol challenges , which have been deemed by one alcohol charity as both ' foolish ' and ' embarrassing			2
' but now his videos have sparked so many copycat clips that the student even faked his own admission to hospital to warn others of the dangers after realising he was ' sending out the wrong message			1
' in one video , filmed in a kitchen with an audience , he drinks a pint of vodka in seven seconds , while in another - deemed ' the rainbow challenge ' - he downs a bottle of red wine , a bottle of white wine and a bottle of rose within a minute			1
since he began posting the videos as ' @entity59 ' on @entity60 just over a month ago , his online following has grown each time he produced another ' episode ' - each more risky than the last			2
when some users commented that he may be drinking water , the man lit a pint of sambuca in front of the camera before downing it			0

he write : ' when [ man @entity166 ] gained in popularity i realised that it was sending out the wrong message and too many people were trying to replicate it			1
this is when i decided to take action by fabricating the story that i had been admitted to hospital ; to deter anyone else from trying to drink these irresponsible amounts of alcohol			0
' on his @entity122 page , the student had written : ' this is @entity181 housemate - he 's just been taken to hospital after 2 pints of absinthe , please do n't anyone try copy him , it 's dangerous			2
' the videos have worrying health implications - under government guidelines men are advised not to drink more than four units in any one day - in one video the man consumes 18 units within one minute			1
@entity194 , chief executive of alcohol education charity @entity196 , said : ' there ’s nothing wrong with enjoying a few drinks on a night out but there are both short and long - term health and social harms that can come from overdoing it			1
' drinking to excess in a short period of time can cause an individual ’s blood alcohol concentration to sky - rocket and can lead to nausea , confusion , loss of bladder and bowel control and ‘ passing out ’			0
' in the most serious cases , alcohol poisoning can cause slowed breathing and result in a coma or even death			0
' socially , the digital world we live in means that people who have been drinking to excess can have their actions come back to haunt them online			0
