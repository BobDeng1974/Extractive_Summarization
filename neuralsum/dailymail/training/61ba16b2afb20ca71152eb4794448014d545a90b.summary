created : 20:54 est , 7 march 2014 @entity0 , 36 , who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009			1
a new law giving people the right to know if a partner has a history of violence will be rolled out from today a scheme giving people the ' right to know ' if a partner has a history of domestic violence will be rolled out to police forces across @entity14 and @entity15 from today			1
@entity0 's @entity16 was created following a campaign by @entity18 , whose daughter was murdered by her ex-boyfriend			1
the initiative , officially called the @entity21 , is designed to provide people with information that may protect them from a potentially abusive situation			1
following a request , the scheme allows the police to disclose information about a partner 's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts			1
@entity0 , 36 , was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend @entity36 at her home in @entity38 , @entity39 , in february 2009			1
the mother - of - one had met @entity41 on @entity42 , unaware of his horrific history of violence against women , including repeated harassment , threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his ex-girlfriends			2
today 's national roll - out has been chosen by home secretary @entity55 to coincide with @entity56 and follows a 14 - month pilot scheme in four police force areas , which provided more than 100 people with potentially life - saving information			1
today also marks the national launch of @entity62 ( @entity63 )			0
this new power will enable police and magistrates ' courts to provide protection to people in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident			2
mrs may said : ' domestic abuse shatters lives and this government is working hard to provide police and local authorities with the tools they need to keep women and girls safe			1
' @entity16 and @entity63 are just two of a raft of measures we have introduced to hand control back to the victim by ensuring they can make informed decisions about their relationship and escape if necessary			0
' protection for victims is improving but sadly there are still too many cases where vulnerable people are let down			0
' i am determined to see a society where violence against women and girls is not tolerated , where people speak out , and where no woman or girl has to suffer domestic abuse			1
' @entity63 can be used to provide immediate protection to a victim where there is not enough evidence to charge an alleged perpetrator and provide protection to victims via bail conditions			0
they can last for up to 28 days , during which time the perpetrator can be prevented from having contact with the victim , giving them the opportunity to make decisions about their future safety with the help of a support agency			0
crime prevention minister @entity122 said : ' domestic violence is illegal and this coalition government has made significant progress in tackling abuse in all its forms			2
@entity0 's @entity16 was created following a campaign by @entity0 's father @entity18 ( second left )			1
the initiative , officially called the @entity21 , is designed to provide people with information that may protect them from abuse ' last year we extended the definition of domestic violence to include controlling and coercive behaviour and in december re-launched the this is abuse campaign to highlight to young people that it 's not just physical violence that makes a relationship abusive			1
' we have also ring - fenced nearly £ 40 million of funding for specialist local support services and national helplines to help people escape abusive situations			0
' the implementation of @entity16 and @entity63 form an integral part of the government 's call to end @entity155 2014			0
the plan includes a commitment to put in place a new code of practice to ensure that safe addresses of victims of domestic and sexual abuse are protected			0
this will take effect where victims might otherwise have to reveal details of their address to people who could threaten them - for example in court cases unrelated to their abuse , or when required for their children 's school records , or the family 's access to benefits			0
@entity0 's @entity178 was trialled in @entity39 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 from september 2012			0
@entity0 's @entity16 was created after 36 - year - old @entity0 was murdered by a man who became known as the ' @entity42 fugitive '			1
in the days after her brutal killing , detectives issued a warning that her ex-boyfriend @entity36 might attempt to communicate with other women via the internet			1
unbeknown to @entity189 , @entity41 had a history of violence towards women and was known to prowl online dating websites and @entity42 in search of partners , often using different aliases			2
the mother - of - one 's body was discovered in the bedroom of her home in @entity38 , @entity39 , in february 2009			0
she had been strangled and set on fire			2
police watchdogs concluded afterwards that she had been badly let down by ' individual and systemic ' failures by @entity205 ( @entity205 )			0
in the months before her murder she had repeatedly contacted @entity205 alleging @entity41 had caused criminal damage , harassed her , threatened to kill her and tried to rape her			0
@entity41 , from @entity38 , was found six days later after her death , hanged in a derelict pub. @entity0 's father , @entity211 , who has backed the campaign , later said he had taken an ' instant ' dislike to @entity41			2
miss @entity0 had told her father @entity41 had a criminal record - though only for motoring @entity217 fact he had been jailed for three years in 2002 for harassing another woman and for six months a year earlier after breaching a restraining order on another ex-girlfriend			0
at the inquest into miss @entity0 's death in may 2011 , coroner @entity221 said women in abusive relationships should have the right to know about the violent past of the men they were with , just as @entity230 recommends parents have the right to know of any child sex convictions of men with access to their children			1
ms @entity221 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing by strangulation as the cause of miss @entity0 's death before making a number of recommendations to be passed on to police and the government			2
the family 's campaign was also taken up by @entity38 and @entity249 mp @entity248 and backed by police and home secretary @entity55 , who agreed to run the pilot			0
mr @entity18 , a former prison officer from @entity252 , @entity253 , said at the start of it : ' my daughter was n't stupid			2
had she known about @entity36 's past she would have taken herself and my granddaughter out of there in a heartbeat			0
' following an article on march 8 about ‘ @entity16 ’ , which allows police to disclose information about a partner ’s previous convictions for domestic abuse , we are happy to clarify that the scheme applies to men as well as women .			1
