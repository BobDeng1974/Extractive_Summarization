@entity7 has two young children who will never again see their father			2
the pain and devastation you have caused to all these people is beyond description			0
‘ in that primeval second of anger and stabbing there is probably no distinction between an intent to really seriously injure with a knife , and an intention to kill			1

when he was asked to return the watch , @entity5 stabbed mr @entity7 in the chest			1
in a legal first , all three boys were charged with murder even before mr @entity7 had died because doctors said he could not survive his injuries			2
