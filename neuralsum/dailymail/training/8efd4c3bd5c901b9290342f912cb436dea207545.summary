by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 7 october 2013 many people covet a celebrity body but one woman was shocked rather than flattered when she was likened to @entity5 winner @entity4			2
being told she was the spitting image of the singer gave @entity8 , 22 , from @entity9 , the motivation she needed to lose weight			1
her step - sister , @entity13 , also from @entity9 , agreed to join her on her weightloss programme and between them they shed 12 stone			1
slimming sisters : @entity8 ( @entity19 ) and @entity13 lost twelve stone between them after @entity8 was compared to @entity5 winner @entity4 @entity8 , who tipped the scales at just over 19 stone and struggled to squeeze into a size 20 dress , and size 16 @entity13 , who weighed almost 13 stone , decided to diet after @entity8 was compared to the overweight singer			1
@entity8 said : ' i was walking along @entity31 when one of the stall holders tried to get me to play a game			1
one of the prizes was a @entity4 cd , and he said that i looked like her			2
' it was just very embarrassing			2
i could n't believe he would say something like that			0
' when @entity8 returned home and recalled the incident to her step - sister , the pair realised it was time to make a change			1
@entity13 , 31 , said : ' after @entity8 told me what happened , we went online to look at pictures of @entity4			1
' it was a shock to both of us and i think it did trigger something - we signed up to @entity55			0
' i ’m sure that small minded man in @entity31 has never thought about what he said since , but now we can look back at him and be proud of how far we ’ve come			0
people need to be aware that small minded comments like that can really hurt			0
' since joining @entity55 in september 2011 , the sisters have supported each other in losing weight , which they credit as the key to their success			2
final straw : it was only after @entity8 , 22 , was mocked by fairground staff at @entity31 who compared her to @entity5 winner @entity4 ( r ) , that the sisters decided to lose weight as they were : @entity8 ( @entity19 ) tipped the scales at just over 19 stone , and struggled to squeeze into a size 20 dress , and size 16 @entity13 weighed almost 13 stone @entity79 and happy : @entity13 now weighs in at a 8st 9lbs , and sister @entity8 ( @entity19 ) is a healthy 11st 7lbs @entity13 now weighs in at a 8st 9lbs , and @entity8 is 11st 7lbs			1
@entity8 said : ' my sister has been so supportive			1
we would n't have last as long as we have without each other - especially at the beginning , @entity13 really kept me going			1
' she 'd remind me how much weight i 'd already lost and how far i 'd come			1
' as she had less weight to lose she reached her goal first , so it was an inspiration for me			2
i knew that if she could do it , then so could i. ' @entity13 agrees , adding : ' i lost the weight quicker , but i needed @entity8 to help me maintain it			1
' because she was still going to the meetings it meant i did too			0
i 'd have probably put it all back on if it was n't for her			0
' body confident : @entity8 says she used to struggle to buy nice outfits but since she has lost weight , she is much more confident yo - yo : @entity13 admits she used to be a yo - yo dieter but has since kick - started a healthy programme and maintained her svelte figure before joining @entity55 two years ago , both sisters hated their figures			1
@entity13 said : ' i was a bit of a yo - yo dieter			1
i 'd lose a bit of weight but then just put more on			2
' it really made my feel bad about myself			0
things like going shopping for new clothes was just awful			0
' you ’d have to root to the back of the rail to find your size and when you put it on it never looked as good as you wanted			0
' @entity8 said : ' i remember it was my son 's christening so i was looking for outfits , and i just could n't find anything nice to wear			2
it was just horrendous - but now you ca n't get me out of the shops			0
' now the sisters say they 've never been happier			0
@entity8 said : ' i feel like a different person since i 've lost my weight - it 's amazing			1
it 's improved my confidence so much and i feel so much happier			0
support : @entity13 admitted that she lost the weight quicker than her sister , but needed @entity8 to help her maintain it @entity135 support : the slimming duo said they would n't have coped if they did n't have each other to spur them on ' i ’m starting a new course at college and before i ’d have been so nervous , but now i ’m fine about meeting new people			1
' i do so much more with my little boy too - everything is so much better			0
i will never go back to where i was before , i ’m so proud of what i ’ve done			0
' @entity13 said : ' i think differently about food now			1
i used to always say that i would never be slim but now i ’ve actually achieved it			0
' if you put 100 per cent in , you 'll get 100 per cent out - that ’s how @entity8 and i are where we are today			2
' @entity152 : big bowl of cereal and two rounds of toast with @entity157 : @entity158 - usually a large @entity159 : take away - either @entity160 or @entity161 : chocolate , crisps , packet of @entity165 : @entity166 : @entity167 with five slices of ham , crisps , chocolate and a fizzy @entity172 : southern fried chicken with @entity175 : lots of chocolate @entity152 : bran @entity177 : tuna or ham @entity179 : a small portion of @entity182 : any of the low points @entity184 : @entity185 : @entity186 : small portion of pasta with @entity189 : fruit or @entity55 snack bars			0
