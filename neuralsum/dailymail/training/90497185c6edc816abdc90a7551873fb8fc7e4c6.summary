that was a really important innings for @entity2			1
there had been a lot of focus going into this game on the senior players ’ lack of contribution , and after @entity10 responded with 95 on sunday , that left @entity2 among the batsmen needing to perform			1
this was just what he needed — and it was a pleasure to watch			0
stand up and be counted : @entity2 stepped up when it mattered to hit 167 against @entity17 double act : @entity2 and debutant @entity19 inspired @entity20 into a commanding position @entity2 ’s previous @entity22 was 20 innings ago , at the end of the home @entity26 series where he ’d been the only @entity20 batsman to stand up to the @entity29			1
in that series , he perfected the late cut on slow , low pitches — a stroke he was encouraged to play because @entity33 took men out of the slips and did n’t always protect third man			0
i think @entity2 managed to train the brain to play the shot , and it brought him a lot of runs			1
but since then , on bouncier surfaces , he had failed to adapt			0
when there is more life in the track for the seamers , the late cut becomes a more dangerous option			0
you have to be careful			0
the signs in this innings were that he was alive to the risk			2
@entity2 generally shelved the shot until the pitch got a bit slower and lower , and the @entity59 bowlers tired			2
i also liked the way he chose the moment to attack			0
long time coming : @entity2 had not hit a test century in 20 innings in the past , @entity2 has been in the shadow of the likes of @entity66 and even @entity67			1
now he ’s the senior man in that middle order , and that means seizing the moment			0
the way he went after @entity72 in the afternoon session was a sign he was happy to take responsibility			0
it ’s a subtle change of mindset for a guy who now needs to show the likes of @entity80 and @entity81 the way ahead			2
@entity2 also went past 7,000 @entity83 runs during the course of that onslaught , and into @entity20 ’s top 10 test runscorers , ahead of @entity87			1
i remember @entity89 motivating himself by carrying around a list of @entity83 wicket - takers , and ticking them off as he went past them			1
perhaps @entity2 could now do the same , because he ’s achieved plenty of other things in his career : 100 tests , 21 hundreds , @entity26 wins			2
seeing himself overhaul some of the great names in @entity101 batting may be just the motivation he needs as he moves into the last few years of his career			0
landmark : @entity2 surpassed 7,000 @entity22 runs to move into @entity20 's top ten run scorers			1

@entity2 scored a *sensational* 167 in the third @entity83 against @entity17
@entity20 batsman had not scored a century in previous 20 innings
@entity2 has surpassed 7,000 test runs and broken the top 10 of all - time @entity20 run scorers , ahead of @entity87
