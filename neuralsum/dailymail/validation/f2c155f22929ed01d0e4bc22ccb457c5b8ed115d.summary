@entity51 referee @entity50 completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger 's corner that enough was enough			0
@entity36 : @entity0 was looking for the finish but @entity3 managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round – and somehow fought back			1
the @entity60 attack was relentless and @entity3 reeled around the ring like a drunk , yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell			2

this time it was @entity0 inflicting the pain			2
one sharp sent @entity3 reeling			2
the next , an uppercut , put him down			0
the third sent him to the canvas again			0
only a mix of gallantry and clinching got @entity3 through more punishment to the bell , which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him			1
10 - 7 @entity36 : @entity3 had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan @entity6 crowd			1
he started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward , playing into @entity0 ’s preference for counter punching			0
the home boy ’s straight lefts over the @entity93 based @entity4 ’s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start			0
10 - 9 @entity36 : the @entity5 was packed to the tank - full , waiting to welcome the fighter @entity6 believes can be its successor to @entity98			1
that atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the @entity102 , @entity103 , brutally knocked out by his veteran @entity105 rival for the @entity2 international middleweight belt			0
the deeply experienced 40 - year - old @entity107 drew @entity108 into a clever trap midway through the third round , opening him up for the perfect right cross			0
@entity112 went down like an axed tree , crashing his head against the canvas as he landed , and there were no protests as referee @entity118 instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance			0

the 28 - year - old 's @entity6 homecoming has finally arrived			1
@entity3 makes his way to the ring with a smile on his face and is looking calm and confident			0
@entity0 has vowed not to make the same mistake as the man from whom he ripped the world crown			2
@entity0 had been considered a convenient underdog when he went to @entity144 in august and surprised the incumbent champion @entity145 to wrest the belt by split decision			0
@entity0 's trainer @entity148 said : ' @entity145 under - estimated @entity0 and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him			2
' there is no danger of @entity0 overlooking @entity3 in the same way			1
@entity3 has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title			2
@entity0 is looking for big fights ahead but @entity3 sees no reason why he should n't get them too			1
' @entity0 is talking about fighting @entity158 or @entity159 , @entity160 or @entity161 — in no given order — before a @entity164 blockbuster with @entity165 sometime next year			0
nothing wrong with ambition but the first question @entity0 has to answer comes in his home town of @entity6 tonight			1
it has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg			0
