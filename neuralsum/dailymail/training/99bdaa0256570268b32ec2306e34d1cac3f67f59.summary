mr @entity12 told her he was not taking drugs , despite text messages about them on his mobile phone			1
' i knew it had been going on , ' she told the inquest			2
' he was n't coming home all weekend , he was rough going to work on monday			1
' he would say he did n't want to go and i said " that 's because you are taking drugs and it will make you feel like this "			2
damning : coroner @entity77 ( pictured ) said cocaine was ' one of the evils of our society ' ' he did admit about two weeks before he died that he had some funny thoughts where he mentioned about one day when he stopped on a bridge and wanted to throw himself from the bridge			1
' i told him how devastated we would be if he ever did anything like that			0
' on the night before his death mr @entity12 was said by a friend to be ' dancing ' and in ' good spirits ' on a night out , and he talked of visiting @entity92 to see a @entity93 he then took a taxi back to the family home with friends , the inquest heard			1

' i asked him to get them out the house because his sister was due to get up for work the following day and did n't want to be disturbed			2
he said " i 'm sorry " and that was the last thing he said to me			0

soulmates : @entity30 and his stepson			0
coroner @entity77 recorded an open verdict and said : ' cocaine is one of the evils of our society , particularly if taken by young people and particularly if taken with alcohol ' ' my view is that most teenagers go through periods where nothing is going right and for him to do that it had to be something else			1
it had to be a major comedown from some drug or something affecting his brain to make him do that			0
' coroner @entity77 recorded an open verdict and said : ' @entity12 's family believe , and i accept , he had everything to live for			1
' he was a young man who committed himself to help others , particularly in raising money for those less fortunate than himself by going on runs for charity			2
a class a drug , cocaine is a powerful stimulant with short - lived effects			2
this means it makes users feel confident , happy , hyper - alert and awake , leading some to appear arrogant or aggressive			0
it raises the body â€™s temperature , makes the heart beat faster and reduces the appetite			0
but many users experience a lengthy ' comedown ' when the effects of the drug wear off			0
this crash can last for days after heavy use of the drug			0
the effects are worse when cocaine is taken with alcohol , because the two drugs interact to product a toxic substance in the liver called cocaethylene			1
this can increase the depressive effects of alcohol , making the reaction to cocaine stronger and making the user more likely to be aggressive			1
@entity193 also takes longer to flush out of the user 's system than alcohol or cocaine , subjecting the heart and liver to a longer period of stress			1
sources : @entity203 and @entity204 ' it is important i pay testament to @entity12 for those efforts he made largely of his own volition to raise money for those less fortunate than himself			1
he was a young man the family should be proud of			2
' he was a young man who enjoyed socialising and going out with friends			2
he seemed to enjoy a drink and without knowing how or why he became involved with cocaine			2
' @entity215 is one of the evils of our society , particularly if taken by young people and particularly if taken with alcohol			1
the risks and dangerous effects on the brains of young people and the judgement of young people is there to be seen in relation to the death of @entity12			1
' he was already planning to go out with his friends the following week and had planned runs and was not someone who had indicated any intention to harm himself in the past when free of alcohol and drugs			0
' he would have had impairment of judgement caused by alcohol and the dreadful effects of cocaine			2
' sometimes coroners are able to give stark warnings on the way it not only places lives in jeopardy and causes the deaths of young people but also the devastating effect to families and loved ones who have lost a young , vibrant and caring individual			0
' @entity12 was a caring young man who should remembered for his charitable intents and equally for the jeopardy he placed himself in by the use of cocaine			1
' after the hearing , mr @entity30 said : ' it 's such a tragedy losing such a wonderful person , me and his mum loved him so deeply			0
' it basically shows the dangers of taking drugs and alcohol and what they can do to you			0
he is a massive loss to not only us but the community as a whole			0
' i have lost my training partner , my best friend and my soul mate , in a way			0
' mr @entity30 already plans to run this year 's @entity18 and the @entity278 10k run in @entity40 in his stepson 's memory			0
