@entity0 has described @entity2 ’s prospective comeback for @entity3 this week as a ' sensitive issue ' which must be handled correctly			1
@entity0 was @entity3 coach until a few weeks ago , when @entity5 asked him back - and for the vast majority of his time at @entity8 , 2005 and 2009 @entity9 hero @entity2 appeared to be permanently retired because of injury			1
but at the age of 36 , the all - rounder has agreed a new deal with @entity3 and is set for a probable return to action in friday night ’s @entity16 at home to @entity18			1
comeback : @entity5 's 2005 and 2009 @entity9 hero @entity2 is aiming to make a @entity22 return high five : @entity2 played for @entity24 , @entity3 , before his possible return for the county against @entity18 cautious : @entity5 head coach @entity0 believes @entity2 's possible return is a ' sensitive issue ' merited : the @entity31 head coach thinks @entity2 should only play if it benefits the team the snag is perhaps , however , that his employers somehow have to find room for him in a team which has won each of its last four @entity22 matches			1
@entity0 said : ' it ’s a sensitive issue with the players that are there			0
' that ’s got to be handled right			0
it ’s a challenge , i think ... a fit , strong , playing - well @entity2 is going to add to any side			2
' coming back from retirement , they ’ve got to make the assessment to where that ’s at - against what they ’ve got in their current staff			0
' to know that , you ’d have to be on the inside - watching people practise and play and decide that it ’s not too much of a distraction , it ’s going to work			0
' glory days : @entity2 won the ashes in 2005 and 2009 ( pictured ) before injury forced retirement @entity66 : the fast bowler took three wickets in his comeback match for @entity24 last week asked if it might be a conundrum for @entity3 to fit @entity2 into their team , @entity0 said : ' you ’d think so			1
' it ’s got to be a cricketing decision			2
' they are playing really good cricket at the moment , so definitely you ’d think it would be a tough side to get into			0
' you pick the best side to play for @entity3			2
that ’s what the supporters are going to watch , and that ’s what ’s the most important thing			0

@entity0 believes the *situation* must be handled correctly
the @entity5 head coach left @entity3 just a few weeks ago
@entity2 is likely to make a return in the @entity94 match against @entity18
@entity3 have won each of their last four @entity97 without @entity2
@entity0 says it must be a ' cricketing decision ' to pick the ' best side '
