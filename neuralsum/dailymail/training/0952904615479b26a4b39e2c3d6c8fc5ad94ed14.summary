by @entity0 almost everything you could wish for from a new sitcom is crammed into @entity4 ( @entity5 )			1
it ’s co-written by @entity7 , who pioneered comedy mock - umentaries with @entity9 , hailed by many film - lovers as the funniest movie ever made			1
co-produced by the @entity15 cable channel @entity12 ( home of @entity14 ) , @entity4 features a zany cast of characters , a coherent storyline and , in @entity19 , a rising @entity20 star in the main role			1
no laughs : @entity4 features rising @entity20 star @entity22 ( left ) as @entity23 and ventriloquist @entity24 ( right ) , as the hero 's sister @entity25 , who is obsessed with a glove puppet called monkey this surgically engineered sitcom made just one slip in its pilot episode			1
it forgot to leave room for the jokes			1
the script is mainly improvised , in the style of outnumbered or the @entity15 comedy @entity37			2
but in the flurry of expositions and introductions last night , laying out the plotlines , the actors had no time to make us laugh			2
a sizeable slice of the episode was devoted to explaining why @entity19 — born in the @entity47 — has a rural @entity49 accent when his sister , father and best mate were all patently @entity53			2
instead of boring us with a laboured story of the character ’s single - parent upbringing in @entity58 , @entity7 should have shrugged off the anomaly and left us to invent our own explanations			2
in an interview to promote the show , he was much wittier			2
announcing that he was ‘ delighted to welcome myself to @entity64 ’ , @entity7 added that ‘ @entity19 has been on my radar since he was a child actor in @entity66 ’			2
it ’s always a worry when the publicity material is funnier than the show itself			2
ventriloquist @entity24 , as the hero ’s sister @entity25 , is obsessed with a glove puppet called monkey , who delivers a tart commentary on the other characters			0
their father , @entity79 , has remarried , to an @entity82 peasant called @entity83			0
@entity79 is obsessed with forgotten @entity85 sitcoms , with titles like @entity87 , which @entity7 carefully invents and shoots , so that clips can be dropped into the show			0
that ’s a painstaking approach to comedy which is n’t actually funny			0
a bit like this whole show , in fact			0
painstaking is an inadequate word to describe the care that went into designing princess @entity100 ’s wardrobe			1
she expressed her whole life through the medium of her clothes			0
princess @entity100 ’s dresses : the auction ( @entity106 ) was a brilliant way to retell her biography			1
taking ten dresses recently put up for sale with a guide price of £ 1 million , this absorbing documentary followed her evolution from gauche , 19 - year - old nanny to landmine campaigner and people ’s princess			1
famous : in @entity121 's princess @entity100 's dresses : the auction , there was the dress from that night at the @entity125 in 1985 when @entity100 danced with @entity126 it revealed the fascinating story behind that frumpy blue suit she wore for her engagement photos and the notorious interview where her fiance , @entity133 , harrumphed about ‘ whatever “ in love ” means ’			1
announcing herself simply as @entity100 , she had paid a call in her @entity138 daywear to leading designer @entity139 , whose formidable shop assistant had taken one look and sent her packing			1
‘ if you must have something special , ’ the dragon snarled , ‘ go to @entity146 ! ’ so @entity100 did , and the result was an outfit that was more mrs @entity149 than fairytale princess			1
just as intriguing was the tale of the little black dress that , weeks later , announced her to the world as a fashion icon			0
‘ @entity159 ’ gasped the tabloids , as she was photographed with her cleavage spilling out of the low - cut cups , designed by @entity139 and @entity158			0
@entity100 ’s image - maker was @entity161 of @entity162			1
‘ if @entity158 will forgive me , that dress may not have fitted perfectly , ’ sniffed @entity163			0
‘ nobody allowed that to happen a second time			0
’ there was the dress , too , from that night at the @entity125 when @entity100 danced with @entity126			1
but who remembers that she also waltzed with @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 ? as one acid - tongued politico commented , no one even noticed that president @entity175 was there			0
@entity133 showed a flash of his nasty side at the next day ’s press conference			0
asked if his wife had enjoyed the ball , he seethed : ‘ i ’m not a glove puppet ! she ’d be an idiot if she did n’t enjoy dancing with @entity126			0
’ who would have thought a few yards of taffeta , silk and satin could reveal so much ?			0
