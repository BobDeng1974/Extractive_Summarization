@entity0 lived through a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic dad and absent mum a woman who nearly died of anorexia and survived a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic father and absent mother has spoken out about her childhood to try and help other children			1
@entity11 , 38 , says she never really had a stable home until she moved to country town @entity13 in regional @entity14 when she was four			1
'' growing up in my household was fractious			1
my dear father was a chronic alcoholic who had severe seizures if he did n't drink , ' she said			1
' it was not your average nuclear family , the house had an atmosphere filled with lots of arguing and fighting and you never really knew what to expect			1
' my mother was emotionally unavailable to me and often lived away from me after the age of 10			1
' she moved away from us to go to work to try and support us			2
' @entity32 was not coping with what was happening			2
' my parents would fight and i obviously did n't want to see that or be around it			2
' my situation was not unique , it 's a lot more common than people realise			2
' unfortunately it 's a reality that a lot of children and young people have to deal with and they have to create another family around them			2
' i was always over at neighbour 's homes and that was the good thing about living in a country town			2
' and that is exactly what i had to do , i moved in with my grandparents pretty much full time from the age of 10 an ' even though i was away from my immediate family a lot i have always had people around me , i had a strong community , not everyone has that which is really sad			2
' @entity0 was diagnosed with ' severe ' anorexia when she was 15 , she was hospitalised for three months @entity0 in one of the many hostels she stayed in as a teenager , she met @entity65 in the refuge in @entity13 @entity0 says much of her teenage years are a ' blur ' after using alcohol and drugs to get away from reality when @entity0 was 14 she developed anorexia and she says ' if i had n't have gone into the hospital when i did i could have died from it '			1
she said : ' the anorexia started when i really wanted to be good at ballet and and i did n't have any self confidence			1
it became my way of trying to control the world around me			2
' @entity0 was an ballerina when she became anorexic ' when i was 15 i was seen by a doctor who saw that i was very ill and i was sent away to recover at @entity83 for three months to be treated for ' severe ' anorexia			1
' i did n't know why i wanted to starve myself but away from family and my life , i learnt that there were some things very wrong with my family			2
' when i was at the hospital i began to talk			2
i was amazed how many people listened and cared			0
' soon after leaving the hospital @entity0 turned to drink and drugs to try and escape from reality			0
at 16 she went into @entity13 refuge and that was where she met youth worker @entity99 who was one of the people who ' absolutely transformed ' her life			0
' it was scary to have people care but i also knew i needed that so much			0
' ' i connected with three of the youth workers over the time i was there and the president of that refuge was a foster carer			0
' the president even took me in when i was kicked out			0
' @entity65 was one of many people that i met and i was really lucky that a number of people went above and beyond to help me			0
' she did more than what was expected , those years are a bit hazy because i was using drug and alcohol to medicate what i could n't deal			0
' that started soon after i got out of hospital and lost one addiction and i found another one			0
' i really felt that @entity65 had respect for me and i could not work out why , she was very encouraging about me achieving life goals and finding a path through the chaos at that point			0
' i was really disengaged from most things in society , when someone like that comes along it has a really positive impact			0
' after losing contact when they left the refuge @entity65 and @entity0 bumped into each other crossing a road in @entity139 four years ago			0
they both worked in child protection and decided to keep in contact and they have been working together on the @entity144 project for @entity145			1
@entity0 ( right ) and @entity65 ( left ) at a recent event promoting the campaign @entity0 , now a mother of four and lives in @entity150 , @entity151 , decided to speak in depth about her childhood to try and help save other who are in the same situations			1
she wants to encourage kids to speak up about their problems as part of the ' @entity160 ' campaign being run by @entity144			1
@entity0 says the help she got from adults and the community throughout her life helped to make her a successful adult			0
@entity0 and @entity65 with fellow charity representatives supporting @entity145 ' kids needs day to day interactions with adults			1
if it was n't for the adults i had in her life things might have turned out very different			0
' i came into contact with a lot of other rough people who were really struggling who did n't have the networks that i did and the outcomes have been really different , ' she explained			0
@entity99 , deputy ceo of @entity144 , hopes by @entity0 sharing her story she can help other children ' the focus of the campaign is to get across that everyone has a part to play			1
' it takes a village to raise a child and sometimes parents ca n't give the child all the help they need			0
' i believe children and young people need the help of more than just their parents , they need the community to show they are worthwhile			0
' i have made sure that i am deeply involved in the lives of all my children			0
' my son started playing rugby union and i had no idea about it until i started going to games and i ended up managing his team			0
' my daughter does ballet and i got really involved in what she was doing so i am part of her life			1
' @entity65 , deputy ceo for @entity144 added : ' this is a story demonstrating positive outcomes when people play their part to support children , especially children facing great challenges			1
' @entity0 is such an inspiring person to so many ; she is a mum , she has completed a degree in music and education from @entity151 conservatorium where she became a member of the @entity222 for high academic achievement , she has a masters in criminology , she has been a foster carer , a kinship carer , a private ballet and singing instructor and a qualified fitness instructor			0
' @entity232 initiative by @entity144 has been designed to try and shift social norms and make the provision of a safe community for children and young people a concern shared by all @entity239			1
' we did a survey in 2009 and it came back that 92 per cent believed that child abuse and neglect was a really serious issue , and my view around that is that people do n't know what to do or how to help and it is always a lot easier if you can give people a story that moves them			1
