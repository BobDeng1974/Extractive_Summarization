provocative series of proposals : the @entity11 acknowledged the @entity6 economy had roared back to life over the past year , but warned of ' imbalances ' that required action from the @entity16 in an assessment of the state of the main @entity36 economies , the @entity11 identified ‘ risks in the housing sector ’ as a problem for the @entity6 and backed calls from other international organisations for the state ’s help to buy scheme to be reined in			1
the intervention – after voters used recent @entity48 elections to reject @entity36 meddling – met with a scathing response in @entity51			1
one @entity53 source , pointing out @entity6 growth had outstripped @entity23 rivals , said : ‘ how do you spell irony ? ’ @entity58 , conservative mp for @entity59 and @entity60 , said : ' having helped bankrupt the @entity62 and delivered the biggest anti-eu election results in history , the chancellor can be forgiven for treating the @entity11 's advice as spam when it arrives in his inbox			1
' most controversially , the @entity11 floated the idea of new property and land levies to hit more expensive homes , suggesting council tax is out of date because it is based on 1991 house prices			2
on the public finances , the @entity11 said the @entity6 had ‘ missed its headline deficit targets ’ and called for a ‘ growth - friendly approach ’ which prioritised spending on infrastructure projects			1
' the way forward ' : commission president @entity82 ( pictured ) said member states ' must now play their part in seeing these reforms through , even if we know that sometimes they are politically unpopular ' suggesting taxes should go up across the board , the @entity11 said : ‘ to assist with fiscal consolidation , consideration should be given to raising revenues through broadening the tax base			2
’ @entity93 has slapped down @entity95 ’s efforts to block the election of a @entity98 fanatic to lead the @entity36			1
the @entity100 chancellor ( right ) indicated she could force through the appointment of federalist @entity102			0
her comments appear to scupper mr @entity95 ’s bid to secure an alternative candidate to be president of the @entity11			2
mr @entity102 is a former prime minister of @entity107 and long - standing enthusiast for a ‘ @entity109 ’			0
yesterday the @entity110 insisted it would be wrong to appoint someone ‘ no one has ever heard of ’			2
but mrs @entity93 said : ‘ i am working to ensure @entity102 gets the necessary majority in the @entity115			2
‘ i am also working to ensure that this decision , even if it is controversial – is made in the @entity23 spirit			0
’ over the weekend it emerged mr @entity95 warned mrs @entity93 that her choice could lead to @entity6 ’s early departure from the @entity36			1
childcare costs , the @entity11 warned , remain among the highest in the @entity36 and should be addressed as they pose problems for second earners and single parents			1
it also said the ‘ predictability ’ of the planning system needed to be increased to encourage development			0
the ‘ non-binding ’ recommendations will be discussed at a @entity1 summit later this month			0
member states agree collectively on what each government needs to do to consolidate and build on signs of economic recovery			0
commission president @entity82 said : ‘ with these recommendations , the @entity11 is pointing the way forward			0
we believe that member states must now play their part in seeing these reforms through , even if we know that sometimes they are politically unpopular			0
’ but @entity146 mp @entity145 said : ‘ i ’m afraid what this intervention demonstrates is that it does not matter who you vote for , the @entity11 and high tax and spend policies win every time			0
’ @entity149 , secretary of the 1922 committee of backbench @entity17 , said : ‘ the @entity36 economy and the eurozone are in a desperate battle against high unemployment and a weakened currency , so it ’s bizarre that this unelected , unaccountable @entity11 thinks it appropriate to lecture the @entity6 government			1
’ business secretary @entity160 , who has also suggested the threshold for help to buy purchases should be reduced from £ 600,000 , will today meet housebuilders to discuss the state of the property market			0
and a @entity167 to introduce ‘ tax - free childcare ’ will be included in tomorrow ’s @entity169			0
