by @entity0 @entity1 this year was a success for some , a letdown for others , and for many women across the @entity7 , such a disaster that it sent them into the arena of affairs			1
@entity11 , the world 's biggest cheating website , has revealed that 17,000 moms signed up to their site on monday in hopes of hunting down extramarital liaisons			1
that is over four times the number of a usual run - of - the - mill monday , reports @entity21 - which boasts 26 million members worldwide and whose slogan is : ' life is short			2
' letdown ? @entity11 is the world 's largest cheating website and claims 17,000 moms signed up to look for affairs straight after @entity1 ' while @entity1 might not have the implicit romance factor of @entity33 or an anniversary , it ’s a holiday that compels women to reflect on their relationships , ' founder @entity30 said in a press release			1
' when expectations are n’t met , it can often be the last straw to trigger an affair			0
' the site is free for women , with men required to fork out $ 49 for ' 20 connections ' and on a typical day , 65 per cent of its members are men seeking a bit on the side			2
this figure flips the day after @entity1 , with 65 per cent of new sign ups being women			1
the only other momentous occasion which drives such a brigade of disgruntled and ill - intentioned women to the site is @entity33			2
cheating through the ages : @entity59 ( left ) was caught in her high - profile affair with @entity61 in 1962 and @entity62 ( right ) is widely rumored to have cheated on then - husband @entity63 with @entity64 not just the men : @entity66 ( left ) admits to cheating on her then - husband @entity67 in 2009 with @entity68 , and @entity69 ( right ) had a scandalous affair with married director @entity71 in 2012 @entity21 sees in an average increase of 60 per cent in traffic on february 15 every year			1
@entity74 spoke to @entity77 relationship specialist @entity75 , who is n't surprised by the statistics , but finds them concerning			0
' whenever we have high expectations , we are bound to be let down , ' she says , adding that being disappointed can indeed trigger women to fantasize about being with someone else			0
' @entity84 , before @entity21 , we 'd just fantasize or wonder			0
but today , anyone can go online , create a profile and turn a fantasy into a reality , ' she reasoned			0
' it 's really , really dangerous			0
' sociologists have long been grappling with estimates for how common extra-marital affairs truly are , with results from various surveys indicating anywhere from 25 per cent to 75 per cent of married people admitting to being unfaithful			0
' @entity1 is a holiday that compels women to reflect on their relationships ' admitting it being the key of course			1
mr @entity30 has said he ' guarantees ' the figure is over 50 per cent , and at the helm of the second - biggest dating website in the world after @entity107 , he is probably well placed to know			1
the site , named after two of @entity7 's most popular girls names , for ' discretion ' purposes , regularly releases statistics it has collected , including the fact that 64 per cent of women log on to the site on their phones while their husbands are in the same room			2
three to five years into a marriage is the most common time for a man or a woman to have an affair , and 22 per cent of @entity7 women admit to having no sex with their husbands at all			0
as for a quick geography lesson , @entity129 sees the most adulterers users , followed by @entity133 , with @entity134 seeing the least number of philanderers			0
but next time a mediocre @entity1 rolls around , ms @entity75 suggests being grateful that you are lucky enough to be part of a family , rather than focusing on feeling disappointed on a single day			1
' cheating is a poor band - aid and rarely leads to anything worthwhile , ' she says .			2
