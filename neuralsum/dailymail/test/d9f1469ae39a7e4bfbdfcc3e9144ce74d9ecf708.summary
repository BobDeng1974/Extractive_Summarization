@entity0 was booed by the audience of last night 's live television debate after complaining of a ‘ total lack of comprehension ’ from those in attendance			1
the @entity8 leader risked alienating those watching at @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 as he protested they were ‘ a remarkable audience even by the left - wing standards of the @entity16 ’			1
his outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching			1
’ mr @entity0 was heckled by members of the audience before @entity30 , who was presenting the broadcast on @entity32 , intervened to say : ‘ @entity0 , let me just say one thing			1
‘ this is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the @entity16 , but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties			1
’ labour leader @entity50 gave the @entity8 leader the advice : ‘ it 's never a great idea to attack the audience , @entity0 , in my opinion			1
’ but mr @entity0 retorted : ‘ the real audience are sitting at home			2
' jeering : mr @entity0 's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching left alone : mr @entity0 ( right ) stands alone while the other four leaders go up to each other following the debate which political leader won the latest tv debate ? which political leader won the latest tv debate ? now share your opinion mr @entity0 said : ' a rapid rise in population due to open door immigration ... has directly contributed to the housing crisis			1
' if you have net migration running at 300,000 a year , that 's 300,000 people who need somewhere to live			0
' miss @entity80 won loud applause as she urged mr @entity0 to ' put the bogeyman to one side '			2
she told him : ' we have a housing crisis across this country			0
you know what , @entity0 ? it is n't caused by immigrants			0
in your world every problem is caused by immigrants			0
' the @entity16 insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night			1
a spokesman for the corporation told @entity103 yesterday : ' @entity104 recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion			0
' @entity104 , a public opinion research company founded in 1989 , was unavailable for comment last night			0
@entity8 meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen			2
asked after the debate about mr @entity0 's criticism of the audience , @entity8 deputy leader @entity112 said : ' i am not sure whether we will complain			1
all i will say is i did n't think the audience was representative of the views of @entity121 people			0
' i think @entity0 would have done very well with people sitting at home			0
' mr @entity112 said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on @entity125 , telling reporters : ' who knows , may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms			0
' at the debate : ( from left ) @entity134 leader @entity133 , @entity136 leader @entity135 , @entity138 leader @entity137 , @entity139 leader @entity80 and mr @entity0 unimpressed : @entity8 voter @entity140 , 44 a @entity8 voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after @entity0 attacked the studio audience			1
security worker @entity140 , 44 , of @entity145 , south - east @entity12 , believed the @entity8 leader had ‘ done a couple of stupid things ’			1
the first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with @entity155 visiting the @entity121 for @entity157 treatment , mr @entity140 said			0
asked if mr @entity0 's remarks had put him off supporting @entity8 , mr @entity140 said : ‘ it did a bit , yeah			1
i do n't think he put himself across right			0
‘ if we 're just talking about the debate tonight - it 's what we should be talking about , not what he 's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me , @entity80 was the best			0
‘ she was slick , she was well prepared , she had been well briefed , that 's my personal opinion			0
@entity50 - it was like he was reading off a script			0
’ asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to @entity8 's views , he added : ' oh no. people at home agree with us and that 's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this			1
' we know , for example , on immigration , on the @entity184 they agree with where @entity8 stands			2
what the audience in here really think is , i suppose , irrelevant			0
' tweeting during the debate , lord @entity192 said : ' a minority view once again			0
@entity0 having a go at the @entity16 audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting			1
' and @entity200 presenter @entity199 tweeted : ' @entity0 having a pop at balance of audience			2
broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair			0
' also speaking at the debate - three weeks before the general election - were @entity136 leader @entity135 , @entity138 leader @entity137 and @entity80 from the @entity139			2
miss @entity80 later mocked mr @entity0 's attempt to ' win friends and influence people '			0
five questions were asked by the audience during the @entity16 ‘ challengers ’ debate , with each of the five leaders also making a short opening and closing statement			1
the first clash of the evening came between mr @entity50 and mr @entity0 with the @entity134 leader saying that @entity8 's sums for clearing the deficit ‘ do n't add up ’			1
but mr @entity0 said : ‘ our sums do add up			0
you obviously have n't read the manifesto			0
' as the end credits rolled following the @entity16 debate last night , four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but mr @entity0 just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand			1
as miss @entity137 and miss @entity135 walked away , miss @entity80 then went to shake mr @entity0 's hand - and mr @entity50 offered the @entity8 leader a pat on the back			1
then , all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception , again , of mr @entity0			2
he shook hands with mr @entity30 before leaving without going up to the audience			2
