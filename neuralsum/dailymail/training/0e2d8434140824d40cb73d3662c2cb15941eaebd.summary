@entity9 - @entity8 ’s @entity7 died at @entity10 , @entity11 after picking up an infection before her birth			1
the one specialist in duty ordered a caesarian but was then called to deal with another birth and midwives decided not to call for another specialist because they ' hoped for a good outcome '			1
@entity21 died after her mother was kept waiting three - and - a - half hours for an unplanned caesarean , an inquest heard @entity9 - @entity8 ( left ) pictured with her husband @entity24 ( right ) and their 20 - month old daughter @entity25 ( centre ) @entity28 , the midwife in charge of coordinating staff that night , was asked why she did n’t call the extra consultant , during the case at @entity33 on wednesday			1
assistant coroner @entity35 asked : ' women give birth at inconvenient times , you must have called for help at inconvenient times before , why did n’t you call for help on this occasion ? ' mrs @entity28 replied simply : ' because we hoped for a good outcome			1
' there was a muted response			0
the mother went into labour shortly around 9.40pm on september 29 last year			0
by 3am the pregnancy had not progressed at adequate speed , and dr @entity50 , the specialist registrar , decided to send her for a caesarean			0
however , he was then sent into theatre to help a woman two rooms away who had been fully dilated for two hours , was not on painkillers and was slightly overweight			0
by 4am , ms @entity8 was showing signs that she was suffering from an infection and was given antibiotics and paracetamol through a drip			2
the inquest is being held at @entity33 ( pictured ) and is expected to conclude today @entity65 died at @entity10 ( pictured ) after picking up an infection before her birth she was not seen again by dr @entity68 until about 6am , by which time it was too late to perform a caesarean , and @entity7 was born around 6.30am by forceps delivery			1
@entity7 showed signs of inhaling meconium , a baby ’s first stool passed when in distress in the womb , and doctors tried to get her breathing on her own			2
however , they were unable to help her survive longer than eight hours			0
she had no other underlying health issues			0
dr @entity68 and two midwives told the inquest that with hindsight they would have acted differently , but said mrs @entity8 did n’t appear to be an emergency case and that the other birth took longer than expected			1
mrs @entity8 , questioning dr @entity68 , said : ' three - and - a - half hours , i think that ’s too long , so much could be done in that time			1
' the doctor replied : ' i would n’t have planned three - and - a - hours hours but there was an emergency , i was tied up elsewhere			2
” the inquest also heard evidence suggesting that a speedier delivery may not have helped @entity7			2
pathologist @entity96 said : ' the infection must have been picked up from the umbilical chord in the womb , so it was before birth , but i am unable to say if it was hours , days or whatever period			0
” the inquest is expected to conclude today .			0

@entity7 was just eight hours old when she died at @entity10
@entity9 - @entity8 kept waiting because the specialist was busy
midwives did *n't* call extra doctor because they ' hoped for good outcome '
by the time specialist was available it was too late to perform a caesarian
inquest at @entity33 yet to determine cause of death
