most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks			1
the must - have for @entity6 mums and dads these days , however , is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception			1
the images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells , right through to the growth of an embryo			1
hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these @entity26 images , which are also helping scientists learn more about the @entity6 process			1
the grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their @entity6 baby , @entity38			2
a tiny camera , placed inside an incubator , films the reproduction process			0
as well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form , the technology – developed in the @entity59 – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process			1
this narrows a mother ’s chance of miscarrying			0
the @entity66 , from @entity67 , had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for @entity6			1
mrs @entity33 , 38 , the head of a nursery , said : ‘ i knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when i failed to get pregnant each month i knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible			0
’ while the couple were undergoing @entity6 , the @entity35 technology was introduced at the @entity75 , allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child ’s conception on camera			1
the technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing			1
pictured is the cell division of now nine - month - old @entity38 in october 2013 , the embryo was transferred into mrs @entity33 ’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful			2
now , nine months after @entity38 ’s birth , she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived			0
experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in @entity6			1
professor @entity97 , who is boss of @entity98 , the first clinic in @entity41 to use the @entity35 , said : ‘ we now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that do n’t make babies do different things			2
' and to be able to see this in a time - matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us			0
’ professor @entity97 , who was part of the team that produced first test - tube baby , @entity114 , in 1978 , said the @entity35 was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies			0
the videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent , professor @entity97 said			0
‘ the couple can see the process of fertilisation , see the cells divide , see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo … it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life			0
’ the video given to parents is a sped - up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops			2
professor @entity97 said his patients were ‘ awestruck ’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant			0
he added that , at across the @entity98 clinics , 1,000 couples , who had gone on to have a baby , had been given footage of their embryo ’s development .			0

new technology allows parents of @entity6 children to view babies ' conception
it allows parents to see the embryo forming far before usual 12 week scan
medics are able to watch process and select best embryo to be *planted*
@entity36 and @entity37 among 1,500 couples in @entity41 to use technology
