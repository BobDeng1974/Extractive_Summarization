mr @entity3 , who has been mp for @entity16 since 1992 and deputy speaker of the @entity18 since 2010 , is a regular fixture in commons bars and at society events			1
but he is also widely admired for the way in which he came out about his homosexuality in an article for @entity25 in 2010			2
after years of @entity4 gossip about his private life , mr @entity3 said he was fed up with ‘ living a lie ’ – and revealed that he had even received threats of blackmail from political enemies over his sexuality			1
‘ with my background in @entity35 , it was hard enough being a @entity36 , let alone being gay , ’ he said			2
‘ it was n’t so much “ the only gay in the village ” as the “ only @entity36 in @entity41 ”			2
’ mr @entity3 , who has never been married , added : ‘ after decades of denying it to myself , and then just denying it to others , i did n’t want to continue living a fraction of my life			1
’ he said he had made the final decision to tell the truth when @entity36 mp and energy minister @entity49 – who left his wife for a gay lover – approached him			1
‘ @entity49 came up to me and said , “ i ’m doing a list of the most powerful gay politicians , do i include you ? ” i thought , this is just daft			2
i am not going to live a lie any more			0
‘ the reaction was , mostly , incredibly supportive			0
‘ a handful of letters spoke more loudly of the sender than the recipient			0
my staff shielded me from the worst examples of intolerance , bile and hatred			0
‘ their message contained not a scintilla of understanding or know - ledge of the open and hidden battles that so many people face in their daily lives			0
‘ there are the many youngsters who are constantly bullied at school or work because people know or suspect that they are gay			2
the relentless harassment destroys their lives and in some cases ends tragically in suicide			0
’ @entity87 role : mr @entity3 with visiting dancers at the @entity14 born in @entity41 in 1957 , mr @entity3 was educated at @entity89 , a grammar which converted to a comprehensive during his time there			1

’ @entity3 mp he was quickly talent - spotted by @entity117 who made him his parliamentary private secretary in 1996 , when mr @entity117 was @entity119			1
mr @entity3 was briefly a party frontbencher when he served as @entity121 under @entity122 between 2001 and 2003 , returning to the backbenches after @entity124 took over the @entity36 leadership			1
since becoming deputy speaker , after the 2010 election , he has impressed colleagues with his handling of @entity18 debates : his good - humoured approach is preferred by many mps to @entity134 ’s more abrasive style			1
some said mr @entity3 was in prime position to succeed mr @entity134 when he stands down			1
master of ceremonies : deputy speaker @entity3 dressed as a ringmaster while hosting a @entity18 reception for the circus industry last month , mr @entity3 made clear his respect for @entity142 by mounting a strong defence of the cost of the funeral arrangements for the former prime minister			1

he also heaped praise on @entity142 ’s granddaughter @entity155 for her calm and collected reading at the funeral in @entity158 ’s			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ if she had been speaking at just a family funeral people can break down and cry , but her composure was perfect			1

' an 86 - year - old lady of infinite grace and dignity , she had the most agonising of deaths			0
’ he blamed the tragedy on a ‘ mixture of neglect , incompetence and indifference shown by the @entity167 ’ before adding : ‘ if she had been cared for properly , if the ward had been cleaner or greater urgency had been shown in handling her case , then this tragedy might never have happened			0
’ mr @entity3 – who enjoys regular foreign trips as part of his duties – made a characteristic appearance in the gossip columns two years ago when involved in a good - humoured , late - night exchange with police after pulling up to the @entity18 gates in a tourist rickshaw			1
he made a futile attempt to persuade them to waive security rules so he could ride on to the parliamentary estate to collect the driver ’s fare			0
