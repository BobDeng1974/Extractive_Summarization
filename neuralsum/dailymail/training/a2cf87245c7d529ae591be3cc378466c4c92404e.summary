signing superstars for loads of money is easy , but @entity3 also knows how to upset @entity5 fans , that ’s for sure			1
the @entity8 faithful – the true @entity5 fans - love @entity10 , and not just because he is a @entity11 lad			1
i can imagine sir @entity13 feeling sick to the pit of his stomach that one of his favorites has joined @entity18			0
he would probably take it as a personal insult , but he should n’t			0
i ’ll explain why later			0
very few players at @entity5 in recent years have sacrificed themselves so much for the team as he has			1
but if you analyse the game with more depth , then you see the worth of @entity10			2
sir @entity13 admits in his book that he ‘ used ’ the striker for a variety of different roles in the team , and that policy had a detrimental effect on @entity10 ’s goals total			1
the shirt fits : @entity10 in his new shirt after the club sealed a £ 16m deal got your number : @entity10 shows off his new no 23 @entity61 shirt @entity13 knew he could trust him to do a job for the team , whether it was as a striker , or on the left , or even closing down @entity68 ’s @entity67 in the @entity69 , a job @entity10 did to perfection , until a ridiculous red card for @entity73 ruined sir @entity13 ’s final @entity75 campaign			1
as a professional , @entity10 is exemplary			2
if you want someone to do a job and sacrifice himself for the team , he is the man			2
he ’s full of self - belief too , which is no bad thing			0
big game player : @entity10 scored some key goals for @entity5 - including one against @entity68 sacrificing himself : @entity10 put the team first rather than personal glory he ’s not fazed by the big occasion – @entity5 fans remember his goal at the @entity92 fondly , and he scored a wonderful back - heeled goal for @entity94 in the win over @entity96 at @entity97			1
in the @entity98 he has scored goals in victories over @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity18 – big goals in big games			0
he ’s strong , quick and he can finish			0
now it is @entity107 ’s job to turn him into the goalscoring striker he needs , the player @entity13 always felt @entity10 could be			1
international star : @entity10 has proved to be a key player for @entity94 taking advantage : @entity107 can finish the job sir @entity13 started with @entity10 he has it in him to be an absolute beast for the @entity61			1
i sincerely hope from an @entity94 point of view @entity10 seizes the chance			2
and there ’s a bigger significance in this transfer			0
signing an @entity122 player , nurtured and developed through the ranks at @entity5 is @entity107 ’s way of tipping his ‘ chapeau ’ to the greatness of @entity13			1
it ’s an admission that @entity107 knows that despite coming close , the @entity18 manager can never emerge from @entity13 ’s enormous shadow			2
with @entity10 , @entity107 is trying to complete a job started by @entity13			1
the @entity18 boss is trying to pay the greatest tribute to his former rival			0
let ’s see how that goes			0
@entity136 ? a closer look at a pre-transfer medical			0

true @entity5 fans will be *sad* to see @entity10 leave
@entity10 has proved himself as the *ultimate* team player
@entity107 must turn @entity10 into a goalscorer
