when @entity1 bared her derriere on the cover of @entity4 in an attempt to ' break the internet ' , the reality tv star created a frenzy			1
it is just one of many recent magazine images that show the 34 - year - old flaunting her giant backside , each one more compromising than the last			1
but while many have been horrified by @entity1 's bare bum in the media , it turns out that it is nothing new - as @entity20 points out , bottom - flashing has been a fail - safe marketing tool for nearly 60 years , selling anything from beauty products and magazines to albums and fashion			1
from the @entity27 in 1959 , left , to @entity1 's infamous paper magazine shoot last year , right , the bottom has a long history been used as a marketing tool long before the curvy @entity33 appeared on the scene , there was the @entity27			1
in 1959 , the suntan lotion advert featured a three - year - old girl on the beach trying to pull her pants out of her dog 's grip , with the taglines , ' do n't be a @entity42 ! ' and ' @entity43			1
' the little girl in the illustrations was based on drawings of @entity47 by her mother @entity48 , was also famous for sketching the @entity50 baby in 1977			1
but little did @entity48 know then , how dominant bottoms would become in advertising , as well as popular culture			1
the @entity54 at @entity55 in 1971 used two bottom baring models to promote new vehicles but it was n't until a decade later , in the 1970s , that rear - ends began to be used prolifically in advertising			2
in 1971 , @entity61 at @entity55 , west @entity55 , combined two of men 's favourite things : cars and women , by using two bottom - baring models , @entity68 and @entity69 , to promote new vehicles on display			2
even serious financial institutions were at it - in 1978 , tsb bank used a bikini - clad lady analysing her bottom in a mirror to promote their travellers cheque service			2
in 1978 , tsb bank used a bikini - clad lady analysing her bottom to promote their travellers cheque service perhaps the best known behind from the decade though , was on the famous @entity82 poster			1
when @entity84 , a freelance illustrator , was snapped flashing her cheeks on the tennis courts at the @entity87 by her boyfriend , the then - unknown 29 - year - old commercial photographer @entity88 in 1976 , she could never have imagined how popular the image would become			0
it has now sold more than two million copies internationally and been recreated by superstars such as @entity93 and @entity94			0
the couple split in 1979 , three years after the photo was taken and while @entity84 was never officially paid for the shot , @entity88 always said : ' i looked after her			0
' @entity84 , 53 , poses with a picture of herself as the eighteen year - old ' @entity82 tennis poster girl ' from 1976 the next significant moment in the derriere 's part in pop culture came in 1984 , with the picture of @entity108 's pert denim - clad behind on the cover of @entity107			1
shot by top photographer @entity110 , critics said the singer , nicknamed ' @entity108 ' , only became a music icon after working out and showing off his new gym - toned rear on the album cover			0
in 1992 , rapper sir @entity116 released his tribute to big bottoms , the @entity122 album			2
the cover featured the artist standing on a giant bottom and the song , with its shameless lyrics , was so controversial that it was banned from @entity129			2
the following year , in 1993 , @entity130 , well known for their powerful advertising campaigns , used a close - up of a bottom with a tattoo that read ' hiv positive ' to raise awareness of @entity137			0
sir @entity116 â€™s @entity122 album cover in 1992 showed him standing on a pert derriere in 1994 , the @entity141 comedy @entity142 started with a character created by @entity144 who always asked , ' does my bum look big in this ? ' the focus was n't just on women 's behinds though - in 1995 , the pop star @entity151 posed up in a pair of white skimpy briefs , complete with back wig and high heels for 7 - up ad campaign			2
but the small tush tide was about to turn			0
by 2000 , pop stars were using their bottoms to promote their music - and bigger was fast becoming better			2
@entity161 took curves into the mainstream when she had a global hit with @entity165			1
the singer was enormously proud of her large backside and instead of dressing to make it seem smaller , she actively sought out clothes that enlarged her bottom			2
in 1993 , @entity130 used a snap of a bottom with a tattoo that read ' hiv positive ' to raise awareness of @entity137 @entity151 posed in pair of women 's briefs in a 1995 @entity180 advert but it was the rapper @entity182 who really got tongues wagging after she revealed her ample curves in a tiny pink thong			1
her explicit @entity188 video firmly proved that we are in the era of the rear end			0
styled as an @entity193 goddess , @entity182 kicks off the @entity194 and @entity196 - produced video by standing on a bamboo platform surrounded by four bikini - clad back - up dancers			1
the tropical - themed tune was guaranteed to get pulses racing with its cut - away shots of jiggling bottoms , including one of the dancers twerking while doing the splits			2
spoof versions of the cover quickly followed			0
@entity210 boy @entity209 , who goes by the onstage persona of @entity212 , uploaded a spoof version with her head superimposed on an exaggerated version of @entity182 's body and booty			1
@entity182 's @entity188 cover caused quite a stir when it was released last year the controversy courting the artist roused a variety of reactions from the industry , with fellow pop star @entity226 commenting : ' i wan na take a nap on dat pillow doe @ @entity182 '			1
but others labelled it ' overly explicit , ' causing @entity233 hitmaker to respond that the pose was no more ' unacceptable ' than similar images of white models			0
to prove her point , the @entity238 winner posted several images of @entity242 models , including @entity243 , striking poses that were equally racy			0
in fact , the men 's magazine has long used scantily - clad women on its covers			0
@entity242 magazine has long used scantily - clad women on the cover , including @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 , centre , and @entity243 , right it included models @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 wearing skimpy bottom - baring bikinis in the @entity259 on the magazine 's 50th anniversary cover last year			0
not long afterwards , @entity161 attempted to steal back the limelight for her bottom by releasing a song called @entity265 with rapper @entity266			1
the cover for the track featured the two females baring their famous bottoms for the camera			1
the song , which is a remix of @entity274 's original , had an equally raunchy music video filmed to go with it			0
@entity161 and @entity266 released an aptly - named song , @entity265 , and bared their bottoms on the cover the duo could be seen gyrating in revealing swimming costumes and being soaked with water			1
it is n't only singers and models using their bottoms for promotion though			0
in 2011 , it was announced that @entity291 's female beach volleyball champions were renting out their rears in an advertising deal that encourages spectators to photograph their behinds			0
@entity296 , 24 , and @entity297 , 26 , inked a deal where they would wear bikini briefs with a @entity303 ( @entity302 ) code printed on the back where it will catch the eye of spectators			0
when photographed on a smartphone , the code takes the user to a specific website - in this case , for bookmakers @entity312			0
@entity297 , left and @entity296 , show off the 2011 @entity312 advertising campaign with barcodes on their bottoms			0
