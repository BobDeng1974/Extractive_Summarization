a @entity1 petrol station worker has been given a bravery award after stopping an explosion at a garage			2
@entity5 managed to seal the valves of a damaged fuel tanker just before the petrol surrounding it caught fire , preventing a huge explosion			1
the incident begins as a black car attempts a routine manouvre on a garage forecourt			0
the pipe twists to one side , releasing highly flammable gas and leaking petrol all over the floor			1
as the motorist makes a hasty getaway @entity5 can be seen running into shot , plunging into the midst of the toxic fumes in order to get to the taps in time			0
not sticking around : however the motorist quickly flees the scene leaving gas and petrol leaking out into action : with the driver on his way out , @entity5 comes running over in order to fix the tank fearless : without a thought for his safety @entity5 runs into the flammable smog in order to turn off the taps without a thought for his own life , @entity5 can be seen desperately trying to turn off the fuel taps while surrounded by the gas			1
after a few seconds he has the valves safely sealed off , which is just as well because moments later the petrol reaches the road in front of the station , and is ignited by a passing car			2
in a fraction of a second the gas and petrol ignite , starting a blaze which completely consumes the garage forecourt , engulfing a parked car and gutting it			2
fixed : with moments to spare @entity5 seals off the valves before retreating back to safety just in time : within moments a spark has ignited the fuel sending flames rushing across the parking lot burning : it takes milliseconds for the fuel to ignite , engulfing the parked car and gutting it but as bad as it looks the incident could have been much worse had it not been for @entity5 's quick thinking , because when the petrol and gas set alight it was dispersed and so simply burned away			1
if the flame had been able to track back up an open valve and into the tank where there was more fuel confined to a tight space , it would almost certainly have caused a huge explosion			0
in recognition of his efforts , @entity5 's local rescue team in @entity108 have given him a bravery award			0
consumed : the flames surround the tank , but luckily there is no explosion lucky escape : because the gas and fuel outside the tanker was dispersed it simply burned away , but had the fuel inside caught fire in the confined space it would have exploded burned : the damaging effects of the flames can be seen on this car which was unfortunately parked nearby			0
