there 's no denying it , the array of @entity2 costumes being created every year have been a little ... well interesting , to say the least			1
known for usually raising a few eyebrows or two , and not always in the good sense , the national costume portion of the competition has always copped plenty of criticism and @entity12 creations are no exception			1
and so the reason for a different direction , again this year , opting to let the @entity12 public vote for their favourite design			2
designer @entity20 ( pictured left ) with @entity22 ( pictured right )			1
the design although voted the best copped a bit if criticism on social media the winning national costume design by @entity29 designer @entity20			1
@entity22 ( pictured ) will wear the design on the international stage in january the winning design by emerging @entity29 designer @entity20 is a @entity34 sunset - inspired gown , @entity35 , worn by @entity22 when she graces the international stage next year			1
the 22 year old designer is aware there is some out there that are n't so keen on the design but welcomes the criticism			2
' i love to take on criticism for the future , but the truth is you ca n't please everyone , ' she said			2
' you have to do your best to produce what everyone likes			0
' ' i was told by a lady at @entity52 that my costume was the most popular to the public compared with previous year 's , so i 'm pretty happy			2
' the budding designer who has just graduated with a bachelor of applied science and fashion technology said she was ecstatic after knowing she had won and the @entity12 public had voted for her design			1
designer @entity20 with her winning design : she says she will take on criticism but says you ca n't please everyone ' she loved it ' said designer @entity66 ( pictured left ) of miss @entity12 @entity22 ( pictured right ) a drawing of the elaborate design which did n't poll as well as the vote with 60 % saying they ' hate it ' while only 40 % said they ' love it ' ' words can not describe how i 'm feeling , so exciting , such an amazing opportunity			1
' @entity20 said she drew her inspiration back to @entity12 's indigenous heritage , @entity12 's oldest heritage to create something with earth colours and blue skies			1
she also used an indigenous print on the skirt which derived from a @entity86 painting in the 1800s after seeking permission from his brother , an aboriginal elder and close family friend			0
@entity20 says in previous years some of the costumes have been a little crazy but has relished the idea that the public has been allowed to vote saying it just shows @entity12 are behind the design that won			1
the other finalists : @entity100 design ( pictured left ) and @entity103 ensemble ( pictured right ) the @entity105 inspired costume was another finalist by designer @entity106 the dream time design received mixed reactions on social media , despite being voted the best of the finalists ' this looks ridiculous ! ' said one comment			1
there was a range of different opinions on the design on social media ' i love the idea , it is about @entity12 , encapsulating and showing to the world			1
you want @entity12 to be behind it , ' she said			0
' giving the public the chance to vote just means they are behind the idea , more accepting of it			0
' the @entity19 facebook page has definitely shown some of the mixed reactions to the widely colourful ensemble			2
one user made a comment clearly stating here disgust at the design			0
' this costume made me spit my coffee all over the tv laughing so hard			0
. this costume is more suited to @entity143 rather than a @entity2 pagent			2
why do we as @entity12 have to be so tacky when designing these things			0
. ? ? ' another stated ' no yuck ' while some did n't really understand what the creation was about , saying if she did n't understand , how would the rest of the world			0
another facebook post said it ' looked ridiculous , i wish there was an unlike button			0

2004 miss @entity12 @entity178 in a grey number ' i liked all of this year 's designs			2
they all looked the part and captured @entity12 , ' wrote one user			0
while another labelled it inspiring , another picked it as her own favourite design , ' the huge sunset and aboriginal skirt stood out ! ' and while it seems to have topped the list in the voting stakes , a recent poll by the @entity193 has shown not all @entity12 were so thrilled about the creation			1
how do you rate the winning @entity2 national costume ? 60 per cent said ' hate it ' while only 40 per cent said ' love it '			1
but @entity20 has brushed off some opinions and says it wo n't be to everyone 's taste			2
' people have to remember that it 's a costume , not a gown , it does have to be out there in order to compete in internationals , it has to be extreme , ' she said			0
' i researched looks in the past decade of the countries that won and i drew inspiration from there as i wanted to compete on an international level			0
' the aspiring fashion designer is also pretty chuffed that @entity219 herself , @entity22 loves the design and ca n't wait to wear it			0
' she loved it , she wanted to be sexy and very @entity12 , very out there , she loved the idea of the @entity224 looking wings			0
' while @entity12 has n't come close to winning the national costume section in the past , @entity20 is optimistic she 's in with a chance			1
' i hope it 's up there with the top designs , i feel i 've given myself a chance from the research			0
' and if she had to pick another winner if her design was n't voted as the top pick , she 's still sitting on the fence			2
' i could not pick a favourite , voting was really nerve wracking and had such high stands , they were all great , ' she said			0
