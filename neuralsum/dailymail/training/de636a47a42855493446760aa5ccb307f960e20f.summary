by @entity0 ahead of the 40th @entity1 at @entity2 this weekend , @entity0 takes a trip down memory lane to look back at 10 memorable contests staged on @entity7 soil			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , 2010 @entity7 win 14 ½ - 13 ½ in what proved to be one of the most hotly contested @entity13 in recent memory , @entity7 claimed a dramatic triumph on the immortalised ' magic monday ' – with drama only to be matched by the ' miracle at @entity19 ' two years later			1
with the competition stretching beyond its usual three days due to the incessant @entity10 rain , @entity23 's 20ft birdie putt on the 16th , which led to a 3 and 1 triumph over @entity25 , set up wild celebrations across the home continent			1
@entity23 proved @entity7 's hero at the @entity29 as he beat @entity30 's @entity25 3 and 1 @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , 2006 @entity7 win 18 ½ - 9 ½ while the emphatic @entity7 victory will live long in the record books , the 2006 @entity34 will more likely be remembered for the emotional reception received by @entity38			1
his wife , @entity39 , had recently died of cancer and following an extended break from the game and a late captain 's pick – which fulfilled his dying wife 's wish that he play in the @entity1 – he walked to the first tee on day one with most of the crowd in tears			2
@entity38 competed in the 2006 @entity1 , not long after his wife had passed away with cancer a 300 - yard drive on the first set up a birdie which would lead to a one - up victory for himself and @entity57 over @entity58 and @entity59 , laying the foundation for a convincing @entity7 victory			1
the win was greeted in much the same style with which @entity38 approached most aspects of his career – with a pint of @entity67 ( on the @entity31 balcony no less ) and a smile			2
even so , there was a tinge of disappointment for him on monday morning			2
he said : ' i 'm probably the most sober i 've felt on a monday after the @entity1			0
i do n't know why			0
it certainly was n't for the lack of trying			0
' @entity38 celebrated @entity7 's win at the @entity31 with a pint of @entity67 on the balcony @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , 2002 @entity7 win 15 ½ - 12 ½ the rescheduled 2002 tournament , which was suspended for a year after the 9/11 attacks in the previous september , returned once more to @entity81 – for the fourth time since its debut in 1985 – and it once again proved a happy hunting ground for the home side			1
with the scores all tied going into the final day , captain @entity92 's decision to place most of his key performers first , as opposed to opposite number @entity95 's tactics to delay them , proved decisive , swinging the momentum towards @entity7 early in the day and leading to a 15 ½ - 12 ½ triumph			1
@entity101 's @entity100 was part of the successful @entity7 2002 @entity1 team that played at the @entity81 @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , 1989 tied 14 - 14			1
retained by @entity7 with the @entity30 looking to overcome two straight losses suffered in 1987 and 1985 , the tensions were palpable			1
from the off @entity106 , the @entity30 captain , declared his golfers ' the 12 greatest players in the world			0
' pre-match sparring was then transferred to on - course conflict , as the notorious @entity113 feud was ignited for the first time at a @entity1 , beginning with @entity115 challenging @entity117 ' attempts to replace a scuffed ball , and culminating with @entity117 challenging @entity115 's drop on the 18th			0
@entity117 ( left ) and @entity115 ( right ) had a fractious relationship during the 1989 @entity1 @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , 1985 @entity7 wins 16 ½ - 11 ½ @entity92 's stout putt on the 18th green , after @entity122 had driven into the water with his second shot , confirmed @entity7 victory and brought to an end 28 years of @entity1 hurt as @entity30 supremacy over the tournament was finally broken			1
@entity92 ( centre ) celebrates @entity7 's first @entity1 victory after 28 years @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity84 , 1981 @entity30 win 18 ½ - 9 ½ although this was the first match on @entity7 soil to include continental @entity7 , it was less than a triumph for the home team			1
facing a @entity30 side with 36 majors between them – 36 more than the @entity7 team had mustered – the thunderstorms on day one were to be an ominous sign for the @entity7 , as they were washed away by the largest margin ever on @entity146 soil , 18 ½ - 9 ½			1
@entity147 ( right ) was imperious form as @entity30 trashed @entity7 18 1/2 - 9 1/2 at the 1981 @entity1 @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity84 , 1969 tied 16 - 16			1
retained by the @entity30 following disastrous 23 ½ - 8 ½ , 19 ½ - 12 ½ and 23 – 9 losses in the previous three @entity13 , 1969 at @entity149 was welcomingly competitive – as well as memorable			2
going down to the last hole , @entity147 sunk a four foot putt , leaving @entity154 to putt for a tie			0
yet in a remarkable demonstration of sporting spirit , @entity147 gave @entity158 the putt , saying ' i do n't think you would have missed that @entity154 , but i did n't want to give you the chance			0
' the @entity30 retained the 1969 @entity1 with @entity163 ( centre ) helping them to do so at @entity165 @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity84 , 1961 @entity30 win 14 ½ - 9 ½ in this @entity1 , the first to be played on an @entity171 golf course , 10 of the matches went to the 18th green providing an exhibition of intense golf for the eager 35,000 on - lookers enjoying the october sun at the @entity166 and @entity176 course			2
yet it was to prove more significant as a landmark , as it became the final @entity1 to be played out in a two - day format , before the rule changes were introduced			0
the 1961 @entity1 was the first to be played on an @entity171 golf course and in a two - day format @entity150 and @entity184 , @entity150 , @entity84 , 1933 @entity185 and @entity33 win 5 ½ - 6 ½ the moment when @entity187 overcame @entity188 in dramatic fashion on the 18th green – two - putting from 30ft to @entity188 's three - putt – was to live rather longer than expected in the @entity146 golfing memory			0
although unbelievable at the time , @entity185 and @entity33 would not win again until @entity192 in 1957 , marking the longest era of @entity30 golfing supremacy in the @entity1			0
@entity185 and @entity33 's victory against @entity30 in the the 1933 @entity1 was their last for 24 years @entity196 , @entity132 , @entity84 , 1926 – first unofficial @entity1 @entity185 and @entity33 win 13 – 1 the match played out between a rag - tag @entity30 team and their professional counterparts in 1926 was to initiate a sporting tradition that would extend to the present day			2
as early as september 1920 , @entity201 had requested that the @entity202 send 12 golfers to play their @entity146 counterparts at @entity2 as a warm up before the @entity171			1
although an international amateur competition between the two nations was established after the @entity2 tournament in 1922 , it was not until @entity196 in 1926 that the idea of a professional @entity30 - @entity146 tournament began to gather pace			2
while called the ' @entity1 ' in the media due to @entity217 's contribution of a £ 250 trophy , however , the decision was quickly made that this could not count as an official competition			0
for starters , the scrappy organisation had put @entity30 at a disadvantage , and the team had been put together by @entity225 rather than the @entity226			0
nevertheless , @entity217 's desire to ' do this again ' following the 13 - 1 @entity146 victory was to be fulfilled in triumphant style , starting with the first official , and formally organized , @entity1 at the @entity232 in 1927			0
with that , a sporting classic was born .			0
