obese monks : almost half of the @entity2 monks studied in @entity9 are clinically obese and 40 per cent face lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure a study of 246 monks from the @entity29 and @entity30 movements in 11 @entity9 provinces revealed that nearly half of them are clinically obese and suffering from lifestyle diseases such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes			1
the research pointed to the oily , sweet foods monks are offered by worshipers as the reason behind their unhealthy lifestyle			1
food is traditionally offered to monks as they beg for food on the streets to survive			2
@entity45 to survive : monks eat one or two meals a day , their last by noon but they also beg for food on the streets which is where they are given unhealthy treats which have been blamed for the weight gain the monks leave their monasteries early in the morning and walk single file , with the oldest monk first , with their bowls in front of them , collecting food from people as they go			1
the monks do not do much exercise either according to the study			2
it said : ' to make matters worse , the only exercise an average monk takes is sweeping the courtyard and walking the streets asking for alms , or food			0

they are also more likely to develop allergies due to their rich , oily , sugary diet			0
a major cause was the amount of fizzy , sugar - loaded drinks drunk by monks , particularly in the evenings when they abstain from eating			0
only 21 per cent of the monks questioned have regular health check - ups and doctor visits			2

they hope to offer dietary and exercise advice appropriate for their lifestyles , teaching about them about nutritional alternatives to their unhealthy food and drink choices			2
they also plan to prepare guidelines on what worshipers should and should not offer to their holy men in order to keep them healthy			0
it is believed that the giving and receiving of alms creates a spiritual connection between the monastic and lay communities who make the offerings			0
some monks eat their only one meal a day , others eat two but all of them have consumed their last meal by midday			0
their diet consists of staples , desserts , preserved and dried food , fish and meat .			0
