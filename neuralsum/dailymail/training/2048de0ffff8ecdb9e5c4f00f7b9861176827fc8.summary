@entity7 , 40 , says she was *obsessed* with getting a good tan
@entity174 noticed a suspicious looking mole on her right calf in 2007
over time it grew to the size of two *£* 1 coins stacked on top of each other
had massive chunk of her leg cut away to remove the *tumour*
says the large hole on her leg has *severely* dented her confidence
