by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 09:12 est , 18 june 2012 it 's the traditional sound which has greeted the start of children 's sack races , sprints and egg and spoon challenges for generations			2
and when @entity10 in @entity11 secured the services of the @entity14 chief starter for their own sports day , the school must have thought it would be an extra special occasion			2
but the school had not reckoned with the administrative power of health and safety council officials , who banned @entity22 from firing a pistol at the event in case the sound frightened the school 's children			1
banned : mr @entity22 , who has officiated over 25,000 race starts , has been told he can not use a pistol because it might frighten the children in an even more bizarre move , the council 's solution was to play a recording of a starting pistol from an @entity36 , before it was eventually agreed that mr @entity22 could use a klaxon instead parents of pupils at the school have branded the ruling ' ridiculous ' and accused the local authority of ' tying themselves in knots '			1
. mr @entity22 has clocked up over 25,000 race starts in his career and even famously false - started world 's fastest man @entity45 at the athletics @entity48 last year			0
alternative : officials eventually allowed mr @entity22 to start the race using a klaxon the 61 - year - old had agreed to start the primary school race as he has family near the affluent @entity57 village , and had previously officiated at hundreds of primary school events			0
one parent , who did not wish to be named , told a sunday newspaper : ' it was ridiculous			2
we were told that the children would be distressed by mr @entity22 firing his starting pistol			0
' anyone who believes they would be frightened by a starting pistol has never experienced the noise at a typical three - year - old â€™s birthday party			0
' the council tied themselves in knots trying to sort this out			1
' one solution they came up with was to play a recording of a starting pistol on an @entity36 so the gun would not actually be fired on school grounds			1
' a spokesman for @entity80 said : ' a klaxon was used because it was felt that a gunshot might frighten some of the nursery children			1
the event was still a huge success			0
' mr @entity22 , who is from @entity86 in @entity87 , declined to comment .			0

@entity80 *suggest* playing @entity36 gunshot sound instead
parents brand ruling ' ridiculous ' and accuse council of ' tying itself in knots '
