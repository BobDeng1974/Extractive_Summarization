a gold engagement ring from the 17th @entity1 has been unearthed by a pensioner with a metal detector - more than 300 years after it was lost			2
@entity4 , 69 , was sweeping his metal detector over a ploughed farmer 's field near @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , when he stumbled across the item			1
the rare ' posy ' ring , which dates back to the late 1600s and is 85 per cent gold , bears the @entity15 inscription ' i noght on gift bot gifer ' , or ' look not on the gift , but the giver '			1
men and women exchanged the items from the 1500s onwards to symbolise their future commitment to each other			0
mr @entity4 , from @entity37 , near @entity38 , told a treasure trove inquest at @entity40 that he initially thought his find in september last year was a worthless trinket			1

treasure hunter : mr @entity4 ( left ) , from @entity37 , near @entity38 , initially thought the gold ring ( right ) was a worthless trinket			1
but a coroner at @entity40 later declared the finding was officially treasure romantic message : the ring , which dates back to the late 1600s and is 85 per cent gold , bears the @entity15 inscription ' i noght on gift bot gifer ' ( pictured ) , or ' look not on the gift , but the giver ' he later added : ' in the last 60 years there have been funfairs on that field , motorbike racing , point to point racing			1
there has been a lot of activity there so i thought that 's where it came from			0
' ' @entity78 ' rings pre-date the custom of proposing with an engagement ring , but essentially served the same purpose			1
men and women exchanged the items - also known as ' betrothal ' rings - from the 1500s ownwards to symbolise their future commitment to each other			0
the rings , which were often swapped at betrothals and weddings , were typically gold with a short inscription on their innner surface			2
the quotations were often from contemporary courtship stories or ' chapbooks '			0
however , the notion of an ' engagement ' ring can be traced as far back as ancient @entity101 back then , @entity103 brides - to - be were given two rings : a gold one to wearin publi , and one made of iron to wear at home while attending to household duties			2
diamonds were too rare and expensive for most people to afford in a ring until the discovery of @entity115 diamond mines in the 1870s			0
even then , they were for a long time seen as the domain of the nobility and aristocracy , with many favouring simpler engagement bands			0
it was only after mr @entity4 , who took up metal detecting four years ago as a hobby , showed the ring to a fellow treasure hunter in @entity129 that he realised it could be valuable			1
he passed the item to museum experts in @entity10 who were able to establish its true significance			1
@entity136 , curator of applied art at @entity138 , told the court that the ring was originally coated in black and white glass , most of which had worn off in the centuries since			0
she said it was tradition to have an inscription on the rings and explained that the name @entity78 related to the @entity149 word for poem - poesy			2
the jewellery expert outlined to ms @entity48 one theory as to how the ring ended up the field in @entity155 near @entity8			2
' there was evidence of a church and graveyard in the adjoining field which could have been there at that period of time so many people would have traversed over this field to get to , ' she said			0
explaining that the ring was very light , ms @entity136 speculated that the owner may not even have realised it had dropped from her finger			0
' in the cold weather fingers shrink and rings can be lost , ' she said			0
' quite possibly she would not have noticed the ring was lost until she got home			0
' ms @entity48 declared the ring to be officially treasure - a ruling that means the item will now be handed over to the @entity177 for valuation			1
scene : @entity136 , curator of applied art at @entity138 , told the court that the ring was originally coated in black and white glass			0
above , the item was found in a field near @entity8 ( pictured ) ' very many congratulations and well done for making such a lovely find mr @entity4 , ' she said			1
however , mr @entity4 will not be able to hang up his metal detector just yet			1
in an amusing twist , after the inquest , the pensioner revealed that when ms @entity136 accompanied him back to the field earlier this year to examine the site she lost her own earring			2
' i am going to have to go back and have a look for it now , ' mr @entity4 laughed .			1
