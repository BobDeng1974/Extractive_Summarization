@entity0 spoke slowly and quietly to add weight to his words			1
@entity4 ’s name had just been brought into the conversation and @entity7 ’s manager had a message to broadcast			1
‘ i think in terms of goals , he needs to improve , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ it is as simple as that			2
any striker — not just him — is judged on his goals and the number of assists he makes			2
at this moment , he has not hit the numbers he will have wanted			2
’ during a day when he had to confront a number of issues , from @entity24 ’s fitness to @entity7 ’s soft underbelly , nothing resonated louder in the aftermath of a potentially fatal defeat to @entity28 than the words that were reserved for the £ 16million man who arrived from @entity31			1
@entity4 reacts during @entity7 's 1 - 0 @entity33 defeat in @entity28 on wednesday @entity4 was frustrated all evening in @entity34 and never had a touch in @entity28 's box whatever honeymoon @entity4 had been enjoying at @entity7 is over after his wretched personal performance in @entity39 , where he barely looked interested and rarely threatened to break into anything more taxing than a canter			1
one goal so far is not a sufficient return			2
it would be unfair to dump all that is currently wrong at @entity7 at @entity4 ’s door — their problems run deeper than a misfiring centre forward — but his static , stuttering displays are exacerbating the situation and , five weeks into his @entity7 career , he has a decision to make			1
is he prepared to put in the hard yards ? is he going to do what @entity0 expects of all his strikers , to hassle and harass defenders to the point of distraction ? will he become the focal point of @entity7 ’s team and lead their charge , ramping up the intensity with his runs into channels ? @entity0 and @entity4 in training at @entity7 's @entity69 base on thursday @entity71 and @entity4 train for @entity7 on thursday at @entity69 @entity7 manager @entity0 watches his team train on thursday after returning from @entity34 none of that looked likely in @entity28			1
flouncing off the pitch at the final whistle without acknowledging the travelling supporters , he was the only member of @entity7 ’s squad to be escorted back to the team coach and the only one to have something else on aside from an official club tracksuit			1
aside from a glistening diamond in each ear , @entity4 was wearing an oversized baseball cap , an image that ensured he grabbed attention , but the time has come for him to realise that he has to start making statements on the pitch rather than off it			1
if @entity4 looks around @entity7 ’s dressing room , he will see professionals who live a quiet life , get on with their business conservatively and push themselves to maximise their talent			1
he has a stage to make a name for himself but , so far , the penny has not fully dropped			2
‘ in terms of his behaviour since he came into here the boy is consciously trying to work hard at the aspects of the game that we would demand , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in terms of the intensity and that work - rate			0
and over the course of the team that is the same			0
‘ we need to return to being a team			0
that has brought us success over the last 18 months			0
when confidence is a little bit low in the team , it can become more about the individual , but that is not what we are about			0
we are a team and when we work to that principle we are at our best			0
’ if that is the case , why did @entity0 sign a player who , as @entity122 ’s @entity121 observed , does not have a history of making sacrifices for the team ? how have @entity7 slipped so far when the memory of what @entity126 was inspiring last season is still fresh ? @entity4 's only goal for @entity7 so far came against @entity130 at @entity131 @entity0 looked frustrated on the touchline in @entity28 at his team 's showing ‘ i always said it was about availability and affordability of players , ’ @entity0 explained			1
‘ @entity4 was the one right at the very end who was available for that			1
i said when he came in there was a calculated risk and it ’s something i have to work on to try to make it work for the team			0
‘ there are very few players who can replace @entity126			0
actually , there are no players who can replace @entity126			0
when you look at the availability of other players during the summer it was something that was difficult for us			0
’ @entity0 looked at a number of options when @entity126 left for @entity158 , including @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , and believes @entity7 did sign a world - class forward in the last window , but the spotlight is now shining to see whether @entity4 prove he is worthy of that description			1
@entity7 's talisman @entity126 left for @entity158 in the summer in a deal worth £ 75million @entity7 signed @entity168 from @entity169 in the summer for £ 10m and loaned him back to the @entity171 side ‘ it ’s no good now , i know , but we took a player in @entity168 who we believe will be world - class , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we will get him ( back from @entity169 , where he is on loan ) next summer			0
now he is a top player			0
he has everything — the speed , the profile and so on			0
‘ but we could n’t bring him in now and that was unfortunate because he can run in behind , he can keep the ball , press and run but that was part of the deal			0
there were very few top - class forwards who were available			0
@entity4 was a calculated gamble we had to try and work with			2
’ if it does n’t pay off , miserable nights such as the one in @entity28 could become a recurring theme			2
like @entity191 's facebook page			0
@entity7 wary of @entity193 threat			2

@entity4 has scored just once for @entity7 since £ 16m move
@entity198 striker was once again *disappointing* in defeat by @entity28
@entity7 have lost four times already this season
@entity0 *admits* @entity4 ' needs to improve '
