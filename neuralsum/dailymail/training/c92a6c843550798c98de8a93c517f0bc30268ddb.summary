by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 08:28 est , 17 december 2012 these breathtaking images show an extremely rare , multi-coloured cloud hovering over a @entity4 island at night			1
the dazzling sight appeared over the island of @entity7 , in the @entity8 , just before sunrise on december 9			1
amateur photographer @entity10 was lucky enough to be in the right place to capture the perfect shots of the cloud , known as a ' mother - of - pearl ' or @entity16 cloud			1
@entity17 : the mother - of - pearl cloud glows in a dazzling array of colours in this incredible image misty mountains : the unusual cloud is often found downwind of high ground , and can signal wind or waves in the atmosphere ' i woke up early about 8.15am just to have a look outside and there it was , ' said @entity32 , a mink trapper			1
' it was completely unexpected but i managed to get the shot			1
' atmospheric optics expert @entity36 said : ' nacreous clouds , sometimes called mother - of - pearl clouds , are rare but once seen are never forgotten			1
' they are mostly visible within two hours after sunset or before dawn , when they blaze unbelievably bright , with vivid and slowly shifting iridescent colours			1
' they are filmy sheets slowly curling and uncurling , stretching and contracting in the semi-dark sky			2
@entity47 : the spectacular cloud hovers high above @entity4 like a visitor from space nacreous clouds , or mother - of - pearl clouds , form in the very cold regions of the lower stratosphere , 15 - 25 km ( 9 - 16 miles ) high and well above tropospheric clouds			2
they form when methane in the atmosphere reacts with ozone , and the reason they are so bright after sunset and before dawn is because , at those heights , they are still sunlit			1
@entity66 , of @entity67 , said : ' it is unusual to be able to see these nacreous clouds as they are formed in the troposphere , high above our weather			1
they are a direct consequence of us releasing too much methane into the atmosphere and this reacts with the ozone to form chlorine clouds			1
' in the past they could only be seen in the polar countries ... but that is worrying because of what it signifies about increased global warming			2
' ' compared with dark scudding low altitude clouds that might be present , nacreous clouds stand majestically in almost the same place - an indicator of their great height			2
' they need the very frigid regions of the lower stratosphere some 15 - 25 km high and well above tropospheric clouds			2
they are so bright after sunset and before dawn because at those heights they are still sunlit			2
' ' they are seen mostly during winter at high latitudes like @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
' sometimes , however , they occur as far south as @entity106			0
they can be less rare downwind of mountain ranges			0
' elsewhere , their appearance is often associated with severe tropospheric winds and storms			0
' nacreous clouds far outshine and have much more vivid colours than ordinary iridescent clouds which are very much poor relations and seen frequently all over the world			0
' nacreous clouds are wave clouds			0
they are often found downwind of mountain ranges which induce gravity waves in the lower stratosphere			0
' their sheet - like forms slowly undulate and stretch as the waves evolve			0
' the clouds can also be associated with very high surface winds which may indicate the presence of , or induce , winds and waves in the stratosphere			0
' they form at temperatures of around minus @entity135 , colder than average lower stratosphere temperatures , and are comprised of ice particles			0
' the clouds must be composed of similar sized crystals to produce the characteristic bright iridescent colours by diffraction and interference			0
