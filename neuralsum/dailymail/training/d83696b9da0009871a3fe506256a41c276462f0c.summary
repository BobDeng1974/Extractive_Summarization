he could be bang in the middle of a crisis at @entity3 but instead @entity4 is playing @entity6 football with @entity7			1
the 25 - year - old failed to convince on @entity9 , where he was often played at full - back by manager @entity11 , but has been earning rave reviews on loan at @entity7 who want to sign him permanently in january			1
@entity3 paid £ 6.7million to @entity16 in january 2013 but may sell for £ 4m			1
the former @entity3 defender @entity4 impressed on his return to @entity19 for @entity7 @entity4 makes an ungainly challenge on @entity21 but was solid at the @entity22 why did @entity7 go back to black ? it was surprising to see a club of @entity7 ’s stature playing without a shirt sponsor			1
that has been the case since last season when the @entity30 produced their own shirts after a kit deal with @entity33 came to an end			2
@entity7 now have a new agreement with @entity36 but as yet no sponsor to go with it			2
however , that does n’t explain why they could n’t have worn their traditional maroon strip rather than last night ’s black number			0
@entity42 is @entity43 in the foreign legion @entity42 took part in his first game on home soil since leaving @entity48 , becoming the 11th @entity19 to play for a foreign club in this competition			0
the others ? @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( all @entity56 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( all @entity60 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 ) and @entity65 ( @entity66 )			0
@entity42 made his first playing return to @entity19 soil since leaving @entity48 over the summer to join @entity7 no olds barred in @entity70 @entity72 's equaliser made him the oldest scorer in @entity6 history at 38 years and three days , replacing @entity75 who held the record on 37 years , 289 days			1
it was also @entity72 ’s 300th goal in a career spent entirely with @entity7 and his first in @entity19 in nine @entity70 games here stretching back to november 1998			2
@entity72 's deft chip beats @entity82 , putting @entity7 level after 23 minutes at the @entity22 @entity72 celebrates becoming the oldest player to score in the @entity6 at the age of 38 @entity86 knows a big occasion when he sees one , but the @entity89 legend turned tv pundit claimed @entity92 fans do n’t appreciate what they ’ve got			1
@entity86 was critical of @entity92 fans leaving the stadium almost empty at 7.15 on tuesday ‘ quarter past seven and there ’s empty seats everywhere , ’ said @entity86			0
‘ it just does n’t have a @entity70 night feel to it			0
' you go to @entity102 or @entity103 , you go to @entity48 , they have a special feeling for it			0

@entity4 joined @entity3 for £ 6.7m in 2013 but failed to live up to his *reputation* on @entity9
@entity113 defender has been playing *exceptionally* well for @entity7
@entity30 playing without a sponsor despite *resolving* kit issues
@entity42 and @entity72 *provide* @entity6 records
