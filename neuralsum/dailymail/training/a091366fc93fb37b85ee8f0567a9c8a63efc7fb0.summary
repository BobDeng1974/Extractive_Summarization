by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor almost 1,500 foreign prisoners are being held in @entity5 jails after the end of their sentence because the authorities can not deport them , new figures reveal			1
more than two years ago @entity9 promised to tear up agreements that mean convicts can not be returned home without their consent to cut costs			0
it comes as ministers boasted that a wave of @entity19 prisoners will be sent back to their home country to finish their sentences under a new deal signed today			1
the @entity23 said deportation was often delayed by ' human rights challenges ' one in eight of all prisoners in @entity5 are from overseas , and 1,466 have completed their sentences but are being held behind bars while officials battle to have them kicked out of the country			1
on average a prison place costs £ 40,000 - a - year , meaning the taxpayer could be footing a bill of up to £ 60million			0
critics said the @entity5 public should not be paying to keep locked hundreds of offenders who should not be in the country			1
last year it emerged that despite the prime minister ’s pledge to tackle the number of foreign prisoners , just 62 had been sent home			1
in the last ten years , the number of foreign nationals in prisons in @entity49 and @entity50 has doubled to around 10,900 and now represents more than 14 per cent of the total prison population			0
ministers admitted that prisons and immigration removal centres were forced to detain foreign nationals because there was nowhere else for them to go			0
immigration minister @entity57 could not say how long foreign criminals were being held after completing their sentence but @entity61 mp @entity60 said it should be made easier to deport them a total of 77 out of nearly 200 @entity19 prisoners are currently eligible for transfer under the agreement between the two nations , the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) said			1
the move , which is expected to save taxpayers around £ 25 million over the next 10 years , should see the first batch of prisoners deported in around two months time			2
the compulsory prisoner transfer agreement , which will save @entity5 £ 2 million in the first year , was signed by prisons minister @entity74 and the @entity19 minister of justice , @entity75			1
it is the first agreement providing for transfer from the @entity5 to outside the @entity78			2
all eligible cases have been referred to the @entity23 for deportation , the @entity63 said			0
mr @entity74 said : ' the co-operation of the @entity19 authorities has been crucial in ensuring these negotiations have proved so fruitful			2
' the @entity5 government wants more foreign national prisoners to serve their sentences in their home country			1
' @entity19 nationals make up the 16th highest foreign national population in @entity49 and @entity50 prisons			2
immigration minister @entity57 said : ‘ in september 2012 , 547 foreign national offenders were detained by the @entity23 in prisons following completion of their custodial sentence			1
‘ a further 919 foreign national offenders were detained beyond the end of their sentence in immigration removal centres			2
’ he could not say for how long they have been held			0
however , the average number of days between a foreign national finishing a sentence and being removed fell from 131 days in 2008 to 74 in 2011			0
efforts have been made to speed up deportations by starting the process earlier			0
anyone who is deported is subject to a re-entry ban , for a minimum of 10 years			0
while numbers are down by around a fifth since april 2010 , the @entity109 admitted it was struggling to cut them further because offenders claim their human rights will be reached if they are sent home			0
@entity61 mp @entity60 , who obtained the figures , seized on the figures as proof the @entity119 needed to be scrapped			1
‘ taxpayers should not be paying for foreign offenders to remain in the @entity5 after their prison sentence has ended			1
‘ they should be deported from the @entity5 straight away			1
' while the reduction in the numbers remaining in the @entity5 under this government is welcome , the laws that block removals and enable foreign offenders to remain in @entity5 , such as the @entity119 , must be scrapped			1
’ in 2010 there were 701 foreign offenders detailed in jail after their sentence , which fell to 516 in 2011 but rose again to 552 in 2012			0
the number of people held in immigration detention centres after completing a prison sentence has fallen from 1,213 in 2010 to 812 in 2012			2
@entity9 has been frustrated at the government 's ability to kick out foreign criminals a @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ we will always detain foreign criminals awaiting deportation if they pose a risk to the public			0
‘ those who abuse the privilege of coming to the @entity5 by breaking our laws should be removed at the earliest opportunity and we are speeding up the deportation process			2
‘ deportation can be delayed for many reasons , including human rights challenges and a lack of co-operation by the offender			0
this can lengthen the period of time an individual spends in immigration detention			2
’ more than 175 foreign criminals were deported under @entity162 , a joint initiative launched by the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) and the @entity163 at the start of september			0
among the criminals removed from the @entity5 under @entity162 were @entity167 national @entity166 @entity169 , 24 , who was arrested for attempted fraud at @entity171 in october , some five months after his visa had expired			1
@entity172 , 35 , from @entity173 , was arrested in october on suspicion of blackmail and soon deported , while @entity176 @entity175 , 36 , was arrested in october for a public order offence and later deported .			0
