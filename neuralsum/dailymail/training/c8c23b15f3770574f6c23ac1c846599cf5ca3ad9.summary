by @entity0 and @entity1 a student suffers from a rare condition which means she spends up to six hours a day picking at her face until it bleeds			1
@entity6 , 20 , has dermatillomania - and dozens of scars across her face as a result			1
she said : ‘ sometimes i actually look like i ’ve been in a car crash			0
the truth is i ’ve done this to myself and i do n’t think i ’ll ever be able to stop doing it			0
‘ it ’s a very real condition with very real consequences			1
’ now , ms @entity6 is revealing the full extent of her scarring for the first time to encourage doctors to learn more about the condition - and help sufferers know they are n’t alone			1
when she first developed symptoms , ms @entity6 felt she was n’t taken seriously by doctors			1
ms @entity6 ( pictured wearing heavy make - up ) picks at her skin for up to six hours a day ms @entity6 ( pictured as a child ) said : ' people ask me what on earth has happened to my face			1
the truth is i 've done this to myself and i do n't think i 'll ever be able to stop doing it ' however , dermatillomania is thought to affect as many as one in 500 people in the @entity47 and the vast majority are women			1
it can affect all ages but most people with dermatillomania are between 15 and 30 years old			1
ms @entity6 will have scars for the rest of her life that will only get worse if she is unable to stop			1
and her temptation to repeat the cycle every day is so strong that she wishes her main trigger point - the mirror - never existed			1
@entity61 - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterised by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one 's skin			1
some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged			1
sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body			1
the condition is often categorised as an obsessive compulsive disorder ( @entity76 )			1
it can lead to bleeding , bruising and infections			2
@entity61 will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour			0
the skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels			1
however , once the damage has been done , those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness			2
although the damage that is caused can be very severe , the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out @entity61 again and again			2
treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy			1
source : anxiety @entity47 if she detects even a minor blemish she will enter a trance - like state where she picks away for hours on end – sometimes even causing her to miss her animal management classes at @entity107			1
‘ it ’s like my mind is n’t linked to my body , ’ explained ms @entity6 , from @entity108 , @entity109			1
‘ if i detect even the tiniest flaw in my skin i will obsessively pick at it until i ca n’t feel any sign of it			2
‘ unfortunately i ’m always left with a much bigger mark - like a graze the size of a penny			2
‘ i know my face is covered in scars but i ca n’t tell the extent of it because there are so many scabs			0
my nose will be the worst and i have a dent in my left cheek			0
‘ mornings and evenings are the worst			0
the first thing i do when i wake up is look in the mirror			0
if i let myself start picking i ca n’t think of anything else			2
‘ hours can pass and i will miss my morning classes at college			2
at night i ’ll leave my boyfriend on the settee watching a film while i disappear into the bathroom only to return raw and covered in sores			2
i ’m trying my best to keep it under control but every day is a battle			2
’ the ritual is having a damaging impact on ms @entity6 ’s emotional health too , as afterwards she can be left feeling guilty and depressed			1
and that in turn means she is ashamed to be seen in public and often shies away from going out			0
she said : ‘ i usually wear a thick layer of makeup when i leave the house but it does n’t cover everything			0
when i talk to people i can see them looking at the marks instead of my eyes			0
‘ people ask me what ’s wrong and i ’m pretty honest about it now			0
i used to be embarrassed but now i see this is who i am			0
it is having a big impact though			0
‘ it ’s made worse by anxiety and stress			0
if i ’ve got a big event coming up like a holiday or a night out with friends i will desperately want my skin to be clear - but the pressure of that will make me pick more			1
so now i just do n’t go out as much			0
’ the condition , related to obsessive compulsive disorder , is thought to be caused by anxiety and has similar traits to trichotillomania - where sufferers pull out their hair to calm their nerves			1
ms @entity6 says doctors did not initially take her seriously when she told them about her condition ms @entity6 first started picking at her face at the age of 14 when she developed some minor acne			1
she said : ‘ even then i would pick obsessively at my spots but it was more like normal teenage picking			2
i went on tablets and the acne cleared up by the time i was 16 , but the picking continued			2
‘ it got worse and worse and finally when i was 18 i decided to see a doctor			0
i felt like a freak			0
‘ at first no one would take me seriously			0
i remember leaving one appointment feeling so alone - like i must be the only person in the world doing this			2
ms @entity6 ( pictured as a child ) has had cognitive behavioural therapy but it did not cure her of the condition ‘ it was only when my mum got involved that i was sent to have cognitive behavioural therapy			1
it helped me recognise some of the triggers and we talked about ways i could control my urges , like distracting myself by playing a game on my phone			0
my worst trigger is simply looking in the mirror			0
i wish mirrors did n’t exist			0
’ some people with dermatillomania feel the urge to pick at their legs or arms , but ms @entity6 ’s focus has always been her face			1
she said : ‘ for me , my focal point is my nose			0
for about two years now my nose has n’t healed			0
it will scab over and i will pull that off			0
‘ i ’ve been given ointment and tablets to stave off skin infections			2
’ ms @entity6 , who plans to one day work at a zoo , added : ‘ i want other people like me to know they are n’t alone			1
i ’ve recently connected with other sufferers on the internet and it feels amazing to know there are people out there like me			0
‘ i want people to realise this condition is real and i ’m not just some person with horrible spots or some skin disease			1
‘ and i hope more effort is put into researching the condition so maybe one day there will be a cure , or at least doctors have more understanding about it			1
‘ but i ’ve decided i wo n’t let it beat me			0
i have a really supportive family and a lovely boyfriend			0
i will keep a smile on my face and try harder every day to pick a bit less			0
