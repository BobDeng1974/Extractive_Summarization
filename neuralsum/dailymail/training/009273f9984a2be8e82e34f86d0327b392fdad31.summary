just five months ago , @entity1 the pitbull mix was found nearly blind at a hoarder 's home in the freezing @entity4 with 88 other dogs , no shelter and little food or water			1
but now , a touching film has revealed her incredible recovery - and how she is enjoying a new life with a caring owner and an affectionate brother , another pitbull named @entity16			2
@entity1 , 10 , was found surrounded by snow and with scores of other animals after an animal hoarder contacted authorities to say she could no longer care for the 89 dogs on her land			1
teams organized by @entity25 traveled to the home , which was three hours from @entity27 , where they found many dogs roaming the property without protection from the cold			2
but the hoarder , who lived in the unincorporated land of the @entity4 , was not doing anything illegal and no charges were pressed			0
instead , the volunteers got to work building shelters for the animals until there were enough resources to ferry them to foster homes , @entity52 film explains			0
@entity1 shied away from human touch - uncertain how to deal with interactions - and volunteers noticed she was suffering a severe eye infection after exposure to the desert 's brutal elements			1
lonely : 88 other dogs also lived on the land with @entity1 , pictured , but some were locked in enclosures long road to recovery : when @entity1 was taken from the desert , right , she was suffering severely infected eyes , left , after being exposed to such brutal elements			1
she underwent surgery to remove scar tissue images show that her eyes were entirely bloodshot and inflamed , leaving the animal in pain and convincing volunteers that if she had been found any later , she would have surely been blind			1
a volunteer named @entity84 transported her and other dogs to a boarding facility - but on the way , another worker suggested that @entity84 could provide a foster home			2
@entity84 agreed - but soon welcomed @entity90 into her home full time			0
she took her to the vet and the animal , whose condition was far worse than originally thought , underwent eye surgery to remove inflamed tissue - the size of cherries - from her eyes			1
other afflictions revealed @entity1 's former life ; she had hardly any teeth after gnawing at the hoarder 's fence , and she nervously paced @entity84 's home in circles resembling the shape of her previous home			2
suffering : @entity1 has hardly any teeth after years of gnawing at the fence at the @entity4 site recovery : she was taken home by one of the volunteers and slowly began to get used to her new life settling in : a video reveals her happy at her new home after she underwent eye surgery ' she had some behaviors that were very typical of dogs that have been unsocialized , in confinement , neglected , ' @entity84 said			1
' she walked in circles constantly			0
' her body was deteriorating			0
had @entity25 not intervened and provided medical assistance i 'm sure she would either be dead or in constant pain			0
' but after attention from @entity84 and becoming more comfortable in her new home , the pacing became less and her eyes began to heal			0
she was also nurtured by @entity84 's other pit bull , @entity16 - and in no time became a ' perfect ' dog , @entity84 told the @entity52			2
loved : she is pictured with her new owner , @entity84 , who called her affectionate - and ' the perfect dog ' at home : the 10 - year - old dog has also found a friend in @entity84 's other boisterous pitbull , @entity16 , right forgiving : even though she was so poorly treated in the past , @entity1 now loves humans , @entity84 said all smiles : @entity84 said that even though @entity1 had been so apprehensive , rescue dogs really do recover ' animals like @entity1 , they really do make a full recovery , ' she said			1
' she does n't bear any grudge against people			0
she really , really loves being around people even though they were so bad to her to begin with			0
' i 'd always heard people say their dogs were perfect and once @entity1 recovered she turned into this dog that is absolutely reliable , confident , affectionate			1
' i thought i had had good dogs before but now i know what a perfect dog is			1
' for more information , visit the @entity25 , which oversaw the recovery , and visit @entity159 for more ' @entity160 ' .			0

@entity1 was almost blind when she was found at the home in january
a volunteer who transported her from the desert *decided* to adopt her
she underwent eye surgeries and had to learn how to trust humans again
now her owner calls @entity1 : ' the perfect dog '
