by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 6 november 2013 a woman has opened up about desperately trying to untangle herself from her ex-husband , who continues to exert his control over her by manipulating @entity5 law			1
@entity6 , 25 , wrote in the @entity7 that she divorced her husband @entity8 in 2012 , but she has spent the last four years trying to get him to grant her a ' get ' - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by @entity5 law			1
without it , ' men ca n't even look at me , ' explains the law student			2
' under the eyes of @entity17 , i 'm still married , chained to someone who refuses to release me back into society			1
' @entity6 , 25 , divorced her husband @entity8 in 2012 , he refuses to grant her a ' get ' - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by @entity5 law the mother - of - one from @entity25 , @entity26 , explained that her husband - whom she says has always been a controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family , making it all the more difficult to loosen herself from his power			1
after numerous attempts to reach an agreement , all met with the same defiance , ms @entity6 has decided to make her story public in an effort to move on with her life			0
she says she saw signs that mr @entity8 would be a difficult husband just three days into their marriage in 2009 , when they spent their first @entity42 together in complete silence			1
explaining that the observance is typically a female tradition , she says he lost his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family			0
' when my way contradicted his way , he criticized me and turned angry , ' she writes			0
her husband then told her : ' you have no choice			0
it 's not my way ' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently over the following four years			0
' under the eyes of @entity17 , i 'm still married , chained to someone who refuses to release me ' not only did he have the final say when it came to religious observances , but he also had control over how their shared finances were used , even though ms @entity6 was the sole breadwinner			2
when she suggested couples therapy , he refused , and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility			0
it was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half			0
' i thought : " how can i bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger ? someone i 'm so disconnected from ? " ' she says			0
refusing to grant a get is viewed in @entity5 law as domestic abuse , but mr @entity8 has said he will sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $ 350,000 - a fee she simply ca n't afford mr @entity8 ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son @entity81 - but he still wo n't sign a get , despite her pleas			1
by refusing to give her a get , mr @entity8 is merely continuing to exert his power over her , says rabbi @entity87 , executive director of the @entity88 for the @entity89			1
this is further reinforced by the fact that refusing to issue a get is viewed in @entity5 law as domestic abuse			1
' when my way contradicted his way , he criticized me and turned angry ' what 's more , as a man mr @entity8 is free to date other woman openly , while his ex-wife is stuck in limbo in her community , where it would be considered adultery for her to move on romantically without a get			1
for his part , mr @entity8 appears to be fully aware of his own manipulative nature			2
during ms @entity6 's most recent attempt to convince him about a month ago , he apparently said to her : ' i ca n't give you a get - how else would i control you ? ' the only conditions by which he says he would sign the get , according to @entity111 , would be if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $ 350,000 - a fee she simply ca n't afford			2
' on paper , i am a free woman , ' she writes			0
' but this means nothing in halacha , and i 'm still imprisoned by my husband to this day			0

@entity120 is *legally* divorced from @entity8 , but he refuses to give her a get - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by @entity5 law
without a get , she is still seen as married in her community , and would be ostracized if she were to move on romantically
