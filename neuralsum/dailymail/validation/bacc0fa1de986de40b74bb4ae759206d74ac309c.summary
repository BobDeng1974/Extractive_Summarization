back in 2001 the former @entity1 vice-chairman @entity0 took part in a @entity4 documentary called the five men who changed @entity7			0
‘ i was voted to join the @entity1 board in october 1993 , i still had my old business at the time and decided that i felt football was really a sleeping giant and still had a long way to go , ’ he told the programme makers			0
‘ particularly after spending time in the @entity15 and seeing how the @entity15 operated their sport , particularly @entity17 and baseball and basketball			1
’ @entity20 thumped @entity21 on saturday - @entity22 is pictured celebrating the third goal in their 3 - 1 victory @entity26 took one for the team as he clattered into the post during @entity20 's win over @entity30 @entity0 , who sold his stake in @entity1 to @entity33 billionaire @entity32 for £ 75m six years later , is regarded as a visionary			1
overseas investment has become an accepted practice in the @entity37 , an attractive market because the top 20 teams in @entity41 football pull in more than £ 3bn a season through television , commercial and gate receipts			1
soon it will be the turn of the @entity20 board , the four men who formed @entity46 , to convince the club ’s supporters that the @entity15 dollar will enhance the club ’s long - term prospects			1
when it comes round to your team , it certainly sharpens the senses			0
what are the motives behind the investment ? why now ? will they develop the stadium ? will they improve the team ? what will happen if it all goes wrong ? billionaire @entity69 is set to join the list of @entity15 owners in the @entity37 @entity20 owners ( from left ) @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 with sponsor @entity78 in the middle holding the shirt @entity0 ( centre ) , who sold his stake in @entity1 for £ 75m , is regarded as a visionary assuming the takeover by the @entity15 billionaire @entity69 is confirmed , the ownership constitution in the @entity37 will be comprised : @entity15 ( @entity1 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity20 )			1
@entity92 ( @entity93 ) ; @entity94 ( @entity95 ) ; @entity96 ( @entity97 ) ; @entity98 ( @entity21 ) ; @entity99 ( @entity100 ) ; @entity101 ( @entity102 )			0
@entity103 , another team involved in takeover talks recently , are currently owned by a group of astute @entity107 businessmen			0
seven top - flight teams - @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 - remain in @entity41 hands			1
manager @entity116 has @entity20 sitting in mid-table since returning to @entity118 from @entity111 there will be a good deal of @entity20 fans who will be sceptical about overseas investment , wondering how a club embedded in the streets of south @entity125 came to be owned by mega-wealthy @entity15			1
visibility is usually one of the main concerns			0
‘ @entity135 ’ @entity129 , who gathered a few more shares in @entity1 earlier this week , only speaks to supporters at the agm because they put pressure on the club to hear from him			2
@entity136 bought @entity93 in july 2003 and the fans have never once heard the @entity92 billionaire speak about his association with the club			1
they will live with it because @entity93 have won three @entity37 titles , four @entity143 , three @entity144 , the @entity145 and @entity146 since @entity136 took control			0
results usually do the trick			0
south of the river , potential is a dirty word at @entity20 because people have been talking about the size of the club ever since 51,482 crammed into @entity118 to see them promoted to the old @entity156 in may 1979			1
back then @entity157 , a @entity93 fan who harboured ambitions to buy the west @entity125 club , was the owner and chairman of @entity20			1
@entity161 for most supporters is for the @entity163 - type , the local boy who made his fortune in the steel industry , to walk through the door and spend his money building a team of champions			2
@entity163 lived in @entity171 , presumably for tax reasons , and nobody complained about his proximity to @entity175 when @entity176 lifted the @entity37 title in 1995			0
@entity163 pumped his money into @entity181 - @entity180 ( left ) and @entity182 hold aloft the @entity37 trophy after @entity181 finished top of the pile in 1995 at @entity118 , the four men who saved the club from oblivion in 2010 , taking them out of administration and into the @entity37 , are all mad @entity20 fans			1
@entity74 , one of the shareholders , admits he bought into @entity20 ‘ to stop my saturday afternoons being ruined ’ when the club were in administration			1
fan ownership , though , is not always such a success			2
@entity196 and @entity197 , both @entity20 supporters and successive owners of the club , took them into administration on separate occasions			1
history is important , particularly to football supporters , but it can also stifle progress			0
@entity206 has to be for the better			0
at @entity20 this means the redevelopment of the stadium , a must if the team are to compete long - term in the @entity37 , investment in better players and an infrastructure off the field to cope with the increasing demands of football at that level			1
when the @entity37 was formed in 1992 , all 22 member clubs were owned by a spread of , mainly , @entity223 - based businessmen			2
@entity89 , champions of the old @entity225 on 18 occasions , were still under the guidance of the @entity229 family			0
redeveloping @entity118 is a must for @entity20 to compete long - term in the @entity37 is it time for the @entity20 to fly higher than ever before under new ownership ? @entity234 , who was among those who championed the idea of a breakaway league , had presided some of the greatest moments in @entity113 ’s history			1
@entity108 were owned by property investor @entity241 ; @entity243 , born in @entity244 and living in @entity41 , was chairman of @entity246			2
@entity247 had recently succeeded @entity248 at @entity249			0
and so it went on			0
in those days stadiums were operating at 69.6 per cent of capacity and the combined turnover of @entity37 teams was £ 45m			0
compare that with the present - day statistics , where stadiums run at 96 per cent capacity and turnover has reached record levels , it is inevitable that @entity37 teams attract overseas interest			2
in south @entity125 , supporting @entity20 is about to change forever			2
on that basis it ’s run to catch up , or get left behind .			0

@entity20 set to be the next @entity41 club under @entity15 ownership
billionaire @entity69 is the man set to take over the @entity20
only seven top - flight teams will remain in @entity41 hands
