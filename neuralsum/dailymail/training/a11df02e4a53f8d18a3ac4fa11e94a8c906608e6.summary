sir @entity1 , @entity2 , said police and prosecutors will apply more rigorous tests after a string of celebrities who faced historic allegations have been cleared			1
but he said police were duty bound to investigate such allegations in the wake of the scandal caused by disgraced @entity22 presenter @entity21			1
recent acquittals of celebrities accused of sex crimes include the verdicts in the cases of @entity30 actors @entity28 and @entity31			1
last week conservative mp @entity32 was also found not guilty of sex abuse allegations , sparking fierce criticism of the @entity35			2
speaking to @entity37 radio station about how officers would approach cases in the future , he said : ' there is no doubt that both the @entity35 and ourselves are going to make a probably more rigorous test of the evidence , given that its such a long time ago			1
' i ’m sure it ’s something that all of us will look at in terms of these historic cases			2
he added : ' i think we ’re trapped in a bit of a fix here			0
this country does not have , as some countries have , a bar on historic investigations or convictions			2
' sir @entity1 said that evidence was already reviewed very seriously			1
pc @entity70 asked sir @entity1 during the appearance on @entity37 whether the force will change the way it deals with whistleblowers after his experience			1
he told @entity77 's most senior police officer : ' i feel very , very let down in particular by the senior levels of the @entity80 and i wanted to take the opportunity to say that			2
' i sincerely hope that people who want to expose wrongdoing in the @entity80 get a slightly less raw deal in the future			0
' speaking to @entity37 radio station 's @entity88 about how officers would approach cases in the future , he said : ' there is no doubt that both the @entity35 and ourselves are going to make a probably more rigorous test of the evidence , given that its such a long time ago ' sir @entity1 said he would be willing to meet mr @entity70 now that there are no disciplinary proceedings ongoing , and that the force is always willing to look at how it deals with officers who raise concerns			1
when asked whether @entity104 will review procedures , he said : ' we are always prepared to do that			0
in each case , as you will know sadly in your experience , it 's not straightforward			0
' of course we will always be prepared to look at that and if there 's anything that comes from it of course we will try and learn			0
it 's a difficult balance to strike			0
' mr @entity70 gave evidence to an influential committee of mps claiming that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become ' an engrained part of policing culture '			2
he was separately put under internal investigation by the @entity80 after writing about changes to the police service in a blog , on @entity130 and later in a book , @entity125			2
@entity104 later downgraded his disciplinary proceedings from gross misconduct to misconduct , meaning he would not have faced the sack			0
a police whistleblower who resigned after raising concerns about the massaging of crime statistics also confronted the @entity2 during the radio phone in but he then decided to resign , blaming his treatment by the @entity80 in the wake of ' making disclosures in good faith and in the public interest '			1
today he told sir @entity1 that there was ' an awful lot ' that the force could learn from his case			1
the commissioner told him : ' i 'm sorry about your experience , i 'm sure whatever the rights and wrongs it 's not something that you have enjoyed , or your family			0
' i hope you would be prepared to accept as well although you 've got a very firm view about of what you have seen and your experience , i have asked for independent advice to find out whether your allegations are endemic or in fact your experience was a one off			0
' mr @entity70 's claims about crime statistics , combined with further evidence submitted to @entity171 , ultimately led to the @entity172 stripping police - recorded crime figures of their gold - standard status			1
( @entity177 : @entity178 : @entity1 ) @entity177 : and lastly , @entity183 in @entity184 , ‘ with the collapse of the case against @entity32 , is too much money and time being spent on these alleged past offences ? ’ @entity185 : i think we ’re trapped in a bit of a fix here			1
i think this country does n’t have , as some countries have , a bar on historical investigations or convictions , just a time limit			0
@entity177 : a lot of your men and women ’s time and money taken up with this , is n’t there , commissioner ? @entity185 : there is , but of course , whichever we do , we ’re going to be wrong			0
we were accused historically of ignoring people who came forward in the @entity21 case , for example , a man who is now dead			1
@entity177 : and possibly @entity212 ? @entity185 : and possibly @entity212 , so we apparently ignored them at the time			0
if they come forward now and they say , “ now you ’re ignoring me again , ” what are we to do ? are we to ignore them twice ? i do n’t think that ’s going to happen			0
so i think we ’ve got to investigate			2
i think there ’s no doubt that both the @entity35 and ourselves are going to make probably a more rigorous test of the evidence given it ’s such a long time ago			1
@entity177 : and that ’s needed now , is n’t it ? @entity185 : well , i ’m sure that it ’s something that all of us will look at in terms of these historical cases but i already know that these cases are reviewed very seriously before they are charge contemplated			0
@entity185 : what you can never do , none of us can do , is predict the outcome of a jury .			0

sir @entity1 said officers will more rigorously test evidence
it comes after high *profile* celebrities were cleared of historic abuse claims
but he said police had duty to investigate in wake of @entity21 scandal
