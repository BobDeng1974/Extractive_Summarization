at @entity1 , they were calling him ' @entity3 ' by the end , such was the young man 's act of insubordination towards manager sir @entity8			1
it certainly was not an oversight that @entity12 's name barely earned a mention in @entity8 's recent autobiography			1
@entity8 's silence spoke volumes			2
they knew this was a player that should be taken seriously			0
on the @entity34 on monday evening , @entity33 revealed an anecdote that provided an insight into the confidence , bordering on arrogance , of this young footballer : ' he told me minutes before he left " i want to be the best player in the world			1
" i do n't know if he 'll be the best player in the world , but i think he 'll definitely turn out to be the best midfielder in the world			1
' the story is well - told by now but @entity1 refused to offer the terms that @entity12 and perhaps more crucially , his agent @entity48 , demanded			1
it was not money alone that decided @entity12 's decision			0
command : @entity12 produced another imperious performance against @entity21 he simply felt that @entity1 did not believe in him , a view confirmed on a @entity57 in 2012			1
@entity1 were crippled by an injury crisis but victory should still have been relatively straightforward against @entity60 of the @entity62 incarnation			1
as it transpired , @entity1 lost the match 3 - 2 at @entity64			1
@entity8 selected a strange midfield , choosing @entity66 and @entity67 in the central midfield positions			0
one week later , @entity69 had been invited to come out of retirement			0
@entity12 never did start a game for the club			2
speak to those at @entity64 and they now recognise a gross error of misjudgement , although it should be said that those voices were rather less dissenting at the time			0
the tone eighteen months ago was one that reproached a young upstart for questioning the knowledge of @entity8			0
now , however , there can be no arguments			0
@entity12 is making the greatest @entity86 manager of all - time appear rather foolish			2
@entity8 's refusal to offer him the wage package he desired can be filed in the calamity catalogue that wears labels such as ' @entity91 ' , ' @entity93 ' and ' @entity92 '			0
once again for @entity19 on monday evening , @entity12 served notice of his status as the planet 's most complete young midfielder			2
he is only 6 foot 2 inches but he seems taller , wider and stronger			0
in domineering form at this @entity99 , he has towered across the global football landscape , a tackler that turns 50/50 's into 80/20 's and a midfield beast allaying flawless technique with a brutal physique			0
one @entity106 newspaper last year described him as an ' @entity108 athlete with @entity110 feet '			0
@entity12 is dancing to the @entity111 beat in @entity110 , taking on opponents , shoving them aside with a scornful disregard as he drives his team - mates up the pitch			2
focus : @entity12 headed home after @entity21 keeper @entity118 flapped at a cross up for it : @entity12 celebrates scoring the first goal against @entity21 it is why @entity123 feel within their right to request a fee beyond Â£ 60million before they even begin negotiating with clubs such as @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity1 this summer			1
they see something in @entity131 that goes beyond the norm , a truly special footballer			0
those at @entity1 saw a leader with fierce determination in @entity131 and anybody that has witnessed the @entity106 team at this @entity99 will have identified the @entity123 midfielder as an obvious candidate for the national team captaincy in years to come			1
and who knows , if he can pull this @entity106 team all the way in @entity110 , there may prove to be something rather prophetic about the ' @entity3 ' nickname that they gave to a pretentious teenager at @entity64 two years ago interest : @entity128 , @entity1 and @entity127 are all keeping tabs on @entity12			1

@entity12 left @entity1 without starting a game after falling out with sir @entity8
before heading to @entity123 , the midfielder told @entity33 : i want to be the best player in the world
@entity128 target @entity12 produced another imperious *display* in 2 - 0 victory against @entity21
