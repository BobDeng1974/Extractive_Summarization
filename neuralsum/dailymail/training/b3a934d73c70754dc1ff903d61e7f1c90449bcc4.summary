by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 14 june 2013 plans to scrap exorbitant roaming charges for using a mobile phone abroad have been unveiled			2
@entity5 lawmakers have tabled proposals to stop mobile phone giants charging sky - high prices to holidaymakers in @entity11			1
the move would mean phone users would be charged no extra for making or receiving a call abroad than they would normally pay at home			1
roaming charges : mobile phone operators will be forced to slash their tariffs in the @entity5 if the proposal is given the green light it could knock hundreds of pounds off the bills of @entity25 holidaymakers , who on average spend an extra £ 120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad , according to price comparison website @entity30			1
a ban on roaming charges would follow a cap that has already been agreed			0
from july 1 , calls made by @entity25 travellers in the @entity5 will cost a maximum of € 0.24 ( 20p ) a minute , or € 0.07 ( 6p ) a minute to receive one			1
text messages are € 0.08 ( 7p ) each and downloading one megabyte of data – the equivalent of sending around 40 emails or browsing five web pages – is capped at € 0.45 ( 38p )			0
on top of this no one can be charged more than € 50 ( £ 43 ) in one billing period , over their normal monthly contract			2
these charges were expected to fall further next year , but the @entity5 now plans to ban them altogether			1
receiving a text in @entity11 has been free since 2009			0
@entity50 , from @entity30 , said : ‘ around one in seven @entity51 arrive home from holiday to a massive phone bill due to the charges they have racked up on foreign turf			1
‘ scrapping all roaming charges in @entity5 countries is a real win for consumers			1
not only will we be better protected from the shock of these steep bills , but the doors will be open to foreign networks looking for a piece of the market in @entity25 , which could mean cheaper mobile deals too			0
’ caps on charges for using mobile phones in @entity11 have been in place since 2007			0
at the time phone companies were estimated to make around £ 3.4billion from these fees			2
since that first crackdown , @entity25 holidaymakers have saved an estimated £ 1.5billion			0
however , while charges have fallen by around three - quarters since the first cap , mobile phone usage abroad has risen by 630 per cent			2
as a result the amount phone firms make from roaming charges is thought to total tens of billions of euros			0
a @entity25 person who travels abroad for 15 days a year , checks a few emails every day , and uses the internet for half an hour would still pay around £ 75			0
holiday concerns : going on holiday will now be far less expensive thanks to caps on mobile phone bills if the ban on the charges goes ahead , it could mean holidaymakers are just charged the standard rate in their contract and would be able to use any inclusive call and text minutes they have , from as early as july 2014			1
however , industry experts believe an outright ban would lead to firms hiking normal prices to recoup some of the lost income			0
@entity107 , the digital commissioner of the @entity5 , said : ‘ i have said from day one in this job that roaming charges should go			1
‘ i want to show the @entity5 is useful to people ’s lives			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity113 said : ‘ roaming charges is the one thing everyone agrees on			0
‘ @entity117 will want to get the ban agreed sooner rather than later so they can go to the elections in may next year and say “ look what we did ”			0
’ the @entity5 aims to publish a legal proposal for the ban at the end of july which will then be put to national leaders in october .			1

phone users will be charged no more for calls than they would be at home
from july 1 calls in the @entity5 will not be charged at the same high prices
