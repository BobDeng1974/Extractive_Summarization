@entity0 will consider an appeal against the three - week ban handed to @entity3 after their star no 8 was found guilty of recklessly kneeing @entity6 and told he ca n’t play against @entity8			1
@entity3 was shown a red card in friday night ’s @entity11 clash with @entity12 for an incident which saw @entity14 suffer his third confirmed concussion in less than four months , leading to calls for him not to play again this season			1
an @entity19 disciplinary panel upheld the red card shown to @entity3 by referee @entity21 and banned him until april 28 , meaning he will miss sunday ’s @entity23 quarter final clash with the two - time champions			1
@entity3 has been banned for three weeks and will miss @entity0 ' game against @entity8 @entity6 was out cold on the pitch at @entity28 after scoring a try sir @entity30 , chair of a three - man panel with @entity32 and @entity33 , said : ‘ this was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found			1
however , there was recklessness meaning that , notwithstanding the harm , it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record			2
' speaking before the hearing @entity0 director of rugby @entity46 made it clear he did not believe his star forward should be punished further and indicated he would appeal any ban			1
‘ i do n’t think it was a red card , ’ said @entity46			1
‘ the sending off certainly penalised us enough on the night			2
if there is a ban we can appeal it			2
if there ’s a ban we ’ll have to sit down and decide what to do with @entity3 because he needs to be part of the process			1
’ it is understood any appeal would be heard before sunday ’s clash , meaning @entity3 could yet feature			1
the incident left @entity14 concussed in the act of scoring his second try of the match and has led to calls for the @entity71 and @entity12 winger to be rested for the rest of the season over fears for his long - term welfare			1
@entity14 was knocked out again and was forced off after a clash with @entity3 during @entity78 ' win over @entity0 @entity14 was unable to continue and has been advised not to play again until the @entity79 in september @entity3 was understood to be distraught after the game and sought @entity14 out to apologise			1
‘ i know @entity3 , ’ said @entity0 club captain @entity81			1
‘ i do n’t think he meant to do it			2
i think anyone knows he did n’t mean to do it			0
i do n’t think it should have been a red card at all			1
i think he tried to slow down , he catches @entity6 but it is a contact sport			0
‘ that is what happens			0
i think they have changed the wording now to say something about being reckless but rugby is reckless			0
the whole game is reckless			0
if you are worried about that , i do n’t really know what we should be doing			0
‘ maybe we should all just wear foam suits and just play touch			0
’ @entity46 said after the game that he believed the repeated replays on the big screen at @entity28 , allied to a partisan home ground , had pressurised the match officials into sending @entity3 off			2
@entity81 also has recent experience of the impact of replays following the second - half yellow card he was shown for a trip in @entity113 ’s @entity112 clash with @entity114 by referee @entity115 after he viewed footage on the big screen			1
‘ i do n’t think it helps with the crowd getting on top of referees , ’ he said			0
‘ with @entity115 , we ( @entity113 ) had set for a scrum			0
it was a yellow card , there is no arguing that , but the fact they replayed it seven times and the same with @entity3 , replaying it , i do n’t think it helps			2
if you slow anything down it will look worse than it is			0
‘ i just think that those @entity130 are there , they have all the angles to see it			0
it is down to their job , i do n’t know why you have to share			0
replays are good but any contentious stuff , why would you let emotion ( come into it ) because we are all fallible			0
the fact i made a mistake shows i am fallible			0
@entity3 tried his best to slow down and caught the guy			2
