by @entity1 reporter published : 03:32 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 06:17 est , 30 may 2013 twenty - five conservative and @entity3 groups are suing the @entity4 over claims the @entity7 administration unlawfully obstructed applications for tax - exempt status because of their political beliefs			1
court papers have also been filed against attorney general @entity12 and top @entity4 officials as part of the action by the @entity16 , a conservative public interest law firm that filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of the groups			1
the center 's chief counsel @entity19 said : ' the @entity4 and the federal government are not going to get away with this unlawful targeting of conservative groups			1
' the lawsuit sends a very powerful message to the @entity4 and the @entity26 â€“ including the @entity27 : @entity28 are not going to be bullied and intimidated by our government			1
he revealed on the @entity36 show that despite assurances from the @entity44 and the @entity27 that the @entity4 had stopped subjecting tea party groups to special scrutiny in 2012 , his office received a letter addressed to one of his clients ' on may 6 of this year from the @entity4 , asking for responses to intrusive questions			1
' @entity19 added that the inch - thick lawsuit , set to be filed wednesday morning in federal court , will include ' a series of letters from @entity56 herself ' - the embattled chief of the @entity4 's tax - exempt organizations division who was placed on administrative leave last week after she refused to testify before @entity62			1
those letters , he suggested , would contradict the claim of former acting irs commissioner @entity65 that two ' rogue agents ' in the agency 's @entity69 office were behind the politically partisan attacks on conservative groups which crested during the 2012 presidential election year			1
@entity19 told conservative tv host @entity36 that his group would sue the @entity4 wednesday morning on behalf of more than two dozen conservative groups that have tax horror stories to tell @entity77 ? @entity56 refused to resign after she ' took the fifth ' before @entity62 and is now on administrative leave			1
the extra scrutiny her @entity4 department gave to conservative groups included at least one letter she personally signed @entity27 press secretary @entity84 said on may 20 that the @entity4 ' misconduct had stopped in may of 2012 , ' but lat least one organization received a lsit of demands from the agency in may 2013 @entity36 said he finds the timeline suspicious			1
' @entity56 knew about this in june of 2011 , ' the conservative host said			2
' the audit that was done internally by the @entity4 was finished in may of 2012			2
recalling a former @entity4 commissioner 's claim during congressional testimony that the @entity4 was not playing political favorites , @entity36 added that ' we were told by @entity99 in march of 2012 , " no , we are n't doing this			2
" ' tea party groups held protests in more than a dozen cities on may 21 to draw attention to their unequal treatment by the @entity4 questions still remain about why @entity34 treasury inspector general for tax administration j. @entity108 conducted only a preliminary ' audit ' of the @entity4 's behavior instead of a full - fledged investigation			1
some conservatives see a political motive , even though @entity108 has previously served in @entity116 administrations and under @entity116 members of @entity62 the @entity16 's website is ground - zero for the tea party movement 's pushback against the @entity4 @entity19 insisted that the @entity4 's approach to dealing with his clients was coordinated ' right out of @entity35 ' ' that 's where it was coming out of			2
this was n't some " rogue agents " in @entity69			2
' he added that some of the @entity4 agents his office dealt with in recent years ' were telling people [ about ] @entity35			0
they were getting supervisory approval			0
' on tuesday , @entity19 showed @entity136 a letter to the @entity138 , a conservative organization his group represents			0
dated march 16 , 2012 , it bears a stamped signature of @entity56 and included a copy of a previous letter signed by @entity143 , a lower - level agent			0
both letters named @entity143 as the appropriate contact person for responding , but @entity56 - or at least someone in her office - appears to have handled the follow - up personally			0
@entity56 's letter , @entity19 wrote on his organization 's blog , was not an isolated missive			0
it ' is representative of the other letters that @entity56 sent to our clients , ' he wrote			0
he also showed @entity136 the may 6 , 2013 letter , sent to the @entity158 - based @entity160 organization			0
it contains 22 questions in 10 parts , including a demand for ' copies of course material ' for the group 's one - on - one mentoring with high school and college students			0
@entity170 first reported on that organization 's saga with the federal government , including the @entity4 's requirement that @entity175 of @entity160 turn over a list of names of all the students who received mentoring through its programs .			0

court papers have also been filed against attorney general @entity12
