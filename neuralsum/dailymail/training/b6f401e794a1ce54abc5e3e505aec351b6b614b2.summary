by @entity0 published : 12:59 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:30 est , 28 february 2014 a couple who both carry the cystic fibrosis gene have beaten odds to have a fit and healthy baby boy - after nine years of trying to have a child			1
@entity10 , who has cystic fibrosis , and wife @entity12 , who carries the gene , had almost given up hope of ever becoming parents			1
married in 2004 , they starting trying for a baby the following year but with no joy			0
@entity10 and @entity19 tried unsuccessfully for nine years to have a baby before they conceived @entity22			1
mr @entity23 has cystic fibrosis and his wife is a carrier of the genetic condition @entity22 was conceived using fertility treatment			1
this allowed doctors to ensure he would n't have cystic fibrosis			1
he was born completely healthy last saturday according to the @entity35 , although men who have cystic fibrosis can enjoy a normal sex life , about 98 per cent are infertile			1
this is because the vas deferens , the tube that carries sperm from the testis to the penis , does not develop properly			0
after numerous failed attempts and a miscarriage in 2009 , the disheartened couple , both aged 32 , considered @entity43 treatment			1
it was only as they were looking into the options that mrs @entity19 discovered she was a cystic fibrosis carrier			1
the couple , from @entity52 , @entity53 , then had to consider a complex set of options to ensure that if they had a baby , it would be protected from the genetic condition that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system			0
instead of ordinary @entity43 , they had to travel to @entity63 to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis - a procedure that provides a slimmer chance of getting pregnant than @entity43 but that allows the baby to be screened for genetic illnesses			2
mr and mrs @entity19 ( pictured at their wedding in 2004 ) say they are overjoyed and relieved that @entity22 has now been born safely and after more negative results , they had given up all hope			1
but last saturday little baby @entity22 arrived five weeks early but fighting fit			2
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ it ’s amazing he ’s here			2
i keep looking at him and ca n’t believe he ’s mine			0
’ about one in every 2,500 babies in the @entity82 have cystic fibrosis			0
to be born with the condition both of a child 's parents have to carry the gene or have the condition			0
if this is the case , their child will have a one in four chance of having cystic fibrosis , a one in four chance of not having the gene at all and a 50 per cent chance of being a carrier but not having the condition			1
source : @entity99 mr @entity10 , an @entity100 mechanic , said : ‘ we were told there was a very high risk of the baby having cystic fibrosis and being very ill. ‘ so instead of ordinary @entity43 , we had to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis where the chances of getting pregnant are slimmer than normal @entity43			1
’ pre-implantation genetic diagnosis scans the cells of embryos , checking the genes for genetic conditions or disorders			0
the couple travelled from their home in @entity116 to @entity63 ’s @entity117 ’s and @entity118 in 2007 as this is the only place in the @entity82 where the treatment was available			0
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ a week before @entity121 in 2012 , we got negative results again , and i thought , “ that ’s it , i ’m not going through it again ”			2
‘ i was in a lot of pain and had had two operations along the way			0
‘ by now , @entity129 was offering the tests , and a nurse begged me to try again			0
’ after paying £ 5,000 for a last try , the couple found out in june 2013 that mrs @entity19 was pregnant			1
mrs @entity19 said : ' it 's amazing he 's here			2
i keep looking at him and ca n't believe he 's mine ' mr and mrs @entity19 almost gave up after their first attempt at fertility treatment failed mrs @entity19 said : ‘ we ’re so happy			1
it was such a big relief			0
’ cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with thick , sticky mucus			0
this causes a cough , recurrent chest infections , and poor weight gain in children			0
the condition affects about one in every 2,500 babies born in the @entity82 and reduces life expectancy significantly			0
