' the pair were well behind enemy lines and even if @entity9 had managed to escape the clutches of the @entity14 , it is unlikely he would have been able to survive the harsh winter			1
' i told @entity16 that we had to get some more equipment because we could n't get him out with what we had			0

he puts the chances of finding @entity16 's remains or his aircraft at 50 - 50 , but said it was important			2
