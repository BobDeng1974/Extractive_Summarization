@entity1 manager @entity0 fears he may have to play a vastly weakened side in next tuesday 's friendly against @entity3 , with more players set to drop out of his squad once the @entity7 qualifier against @entity8 has been played			1
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 have all been forced to withdraw through injury already while @entity14 and @entity15 were unable to play a full part in training on tuesday			1
and @entity0 expects to lose even more players in what is one of his most - significantly weakened @entity1 squads in recent memory			1
@entity0 fears he could lose even more members of his @entity1 squad to injury in the coming days the @entity1 manager already has a long list of absentees but could see more ahead of facing @entity3 @entity0 oversaw training with the squad at @entity31 on tuesday ahead of the two upcoming games the @entity1 fly to @entity33 on monday following friday night 's game against @entity8 at @entity35 , but they could be missing even more players by the time they come to face the side they were beaten by in their @entity41 opener last summer			1
' apart from all those players that i ’ve suggested or have said are n’t here through injury i fear we ’re going to lose a few more , ' @entity0 said			2
' there ’s one or two that i know wo n’t be able to join us against @entity3 because of the current problems that they ’re dealing with at the moment , so on this occasion in particular it wo n’t be as strong a team as i maybe would have liked to put out			0
' in @entity1 , unfortunately you 're always judged harshly and you 're in the spotlight because everyone wants @entity1 to do well and believes we can do well			0
' we ’ll accept that but as far as i ’m concerned it ’s still the qualifiers that i put top of my list of priorities even though on paper @entity3 are a strong team to play than @entity8			2
' @entity9 scored for @entity67 at the weekend but has been ruled out for @entity1 with a hip problem @entity10 is another @entity67 and @entity1 player struggling with injury - he pulled out with groin trouble @entity11 was in significant pain after picking up an injury for @entity73 and also withdrew @entity12 is another absentee for @entity0 , pulling out with an ankle problem ahead of the @entity8 game @entity0 has been frustrated to see so many players absent from this selection but admits his luck with injuries of late may be coming back to bite him			1
' we ’ve been a bit unlucky on this occasion , it ’s unusual , ' he told @entity85			0
' we ’ve been very lucky most of the times we ’ve got squads together that we have n’t lost a lot of players			0
this time to lose the two goalkeepers ( @entity11 and @entity91 ) for example is an incredible blow			2
to lose people like ( @entity96 ) @entity95 , @entity10 , ( @entity98 ) @entity97 , @entity9 , all of whom you think are very important players in the year to come , to lose them all ahead of a qualifier that ’s been a bit hard to take			1
' but i still think theres enough good ones out there , so i still think we can get 11 good players on the field			0
' @entity14 was unable to take part in a full training session with the rest of the squad on tuesday @entity15 ( bottom ) has only just joined up with @entity1 after suffering from sickness of late @entity1 have taken a maximum 12 points from their four games in qualifying group e so far , marking an impressive turnaround since the summer 's embarrassing @entity41 group stage exit which came without a win from games against @entity3 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
but @entity0 is not getting carried away with the momentum his side appear to be building up ahead of next summer 's tournament in @entity128 that they look dead - certs to qualify for			2
' you ’re always pleased when you ’re winning but i think we ’re also trying to keep our feet on the ground , ' he said			0
' we 've been benefiting from a group which is n't the toughest of the groups			0
there ’s lots of very , very difficult games ahead and we realise also that everything we 're doing at the moment is going to be truly judged in 2016			0

@entity0 thinks @entity1 will lose more players to injury soon
he has identified one or two likely to pull out ahead of @entity3 friendly
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 have all already pulled out with other players struggling during training
@entity1 face @entity8 before flying to @entity33 for tuesday 's game
