the mystery as to why our galaxy ’s supermassive black hole is dormant has stumped scientists for decades			1
but new evidence suggests that the ‘ sleeping dragon ’ was in fact active at some point - we just were n’t around to see it			1
astronomers claim that the supermassive black hole erupted two million years ago in an explosion so immensely powerful that it lit up a cloud 200,000 light years away			1
the way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy while scientists had previously predicted that such an outburst had occurred , this is the first time they have been able to say when it happened			2
the finding is a confirmation that black holes can ' flicker ' , moving from maximum power to switching off over , in cosmic terms , short periods of time			0
‘ now we know when this sleeping dragon , four million times the mass of the sun , awoke and breathed fire with 100 million times the power it has today , ’ said professor @entity37 - @entity36 , lead author of the study published in the @entity40			0
‘ it 's been long suspected that our @entity55 might have sporadically flared up in the past			0
these observations are a highly suggestive “ smoking gun ” , ’ said @entity49 , astronomer royal , who was one of the first scientists to suggest that massive black holes power quasars			2
the evidence for the findings comes from a lacy filament of hydrogen gas called the @entity61			2
it trails behind our galaxy 's two small companion galaxies , the @entity66			0
‘ since 1996 , we 've been aware of an odd glow from the @entity61 , but did n't understand the cause			0
‘ then this year , it finally dawned on me that it must be the mark , the fossil record , of a huge outburst of energy from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy			1
’ the region around the galaxy 's supermassive black hole and the black hole is called @entity78 ( pronounced @entity78 )			1
it emits radio , infrared , ultraviolet , x-ray and gamma ray emissions			0
flickers of radiation rise up when small clouds of gas fall onto the hot disk of matter that swirls around the black hole			1
but scientists had been puzzled by evidence contrary to this activity that revealed there was a cataclysmic event in the past			2
‘ in particular , in 2010 @entity105 's @entity104 satellite discovered two huge bubbles of hot gas billowing out from the centre of the galaxy , covering almost a quarter of the sky , ’ said professor @entity102			0
the large image contains x-rays from @entity105 's @entity113 in blue and infrared emission from the @entity115 in red and yellow			0
the inset shows a close - up view of our galaxy 's supermassive black hole in x-rays only , covering a region half a light year wide earlier this year , computer simulations of the @entity104 bubbles made by the @entity126 controversially suggested that they were caused by a colossal explosion from @entity78 within the last few million years			1
‘ when i saw this research i realised that this same event would also explain the mysterious glow that we see on the @entity61 , ’ professor @entity102 said			0
‘ together with dr @entity132 from @entity133 and dr @entity134 , from the @entity135 , i calculated that to explain the glow it must have happened two million years ago because the energy release shown by the @entity126 group perfectly matched , to our delight , that from the @entity61			1
’ the realisation that these black holes can switch on and off within a million years , which given the universe is 14 billion years old means very rapidly , has been described by researchers as a ‘ significant discovery ’			1
professor @entity102 said it is certain that this event will happen again			0
‘ there are lots of stars and gas clouds that could fall onto the hot disk around the black hole , ’ he said			2
‘ there 's a gas cloud called @entity159 that astronomers around the world are anticipating will fall onto the black hole early next year			1
it 's small , but we 're looking forward to the fireworks			0

for 20 years scientists had suspected that a huge outburst had occurred
evidence now suggests the black hole did in fact erupt two million years ago
explosion was so powerful that it lit up a cloud 200,000 light years away
astronomers predict that a gas cloud called @entity159 could cause activity in the black hole early next year
