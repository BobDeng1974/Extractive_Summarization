they are this year ’s must - have @entity2 presents for selfie - obsessed @entity3			0
so - called ‘ selfie - sticks ’ that allow camera phones to be extended up to a metre away for group shots and panoramic images are flying off the shelves			1
while the selfie might have gone mainstream in 2014 , it now appears that simply taking a picture of yourself and others with your smartphone is passe			0
above , a tourist uses one of the gadgets while touring @entity23 landmarks users are experimenting with ever more creative selfie - methods - on top of tall buildings and in front of planes - to complement the ubiquitous pictures alongside friends and celebrities			0
the idea of using a light - weight extendable metal pole with a grip to hold a smartphone - the early selfie - stick - came from fans of extreme sports who wanted to capture images of themselves in action			1
the poles took off in @entity18 and are now sweeping the @entity3 after two @entity3 entrepreneurs , @entity45 and @entity46 , spotted a gap in the market			1
mr @entity45 said : ‘ we were at a schoolfriend ’s wedding in @entity52 and while we were there we saw hundreds of people attaching their phones to these sticks and taking selfies			1
‘ when we first saw the selfie - sticks we did think “ that ’s a bit weird ” , then we realised there was a gap in the market for something like this			2
’ the pair formed their own @entity68 - based company , @entity67 , and now produce five versions of the sticks costing upwards of £ 7.99			1
the most basic is simply as extendable pole , meaning the selfie - taker sets the phone timer to take a picture			2
but more advanced versions from £ 14.99 have bluetooth shutter releases on the handles which link to your smartphone meaning you can control exactly when you take your picture			2
they come in a variety of colours and styles			0
as well as being popular for group shots , the sticks are increasingly appearing at sporting events and concerts as a way of getting above a crowd to capture an action image			1
the pair have sold 6,000 pods between august and the end of november , with another 5,000 ordered to cope with @entity2 demand			0
earlier this month , the @entity99 authorities banned the use of ‘ unregulated ’ selfie - sticks after deciding their use of @entity103 makes them ‘ telecommunications devices ’ that must be tested and registered in case they interfere with other gadgets			0
mr @entity45 added : ‘ lots of people think “ what is the point of this ? ” but once you ’ve had a go on one and seen the cool pictures you can produce without the need for a cameraperson , you realise that these little things are really quite a cool bit of kit			0
