by @entity0 these pets may all be pug - ugly - but only one will hound out the competition to be crowned the ugliest dog in all the world			1
the rough - looking animals - all of whom have been certified ' naturally ugly ' by their vets - will fight it out in @entity9 to receive the dubious honour of first place at the @entity12			1
judges will decide this friday which of the animals - with their toothy smiles , crazed hair and wild expressions - is the most displeasing of all , netting the proud owners a $ 1,500 prize			2
the contest , now in its 26th year , is held annually at the @entity42 in @entity9			1

' the owners of all kinds of dogs are also all kinds of people - from youngsters to senior citizens , each proud of their pet despite missing fur , being crossed eyes , waddling like a duck or having mismatched ears			0
' @entity76 is not about making fun of ugly dogs but having fun with some wonderful characters and showing the world that these dogs are much loved and beautiful creatures			1
' the winning dog becomes an instant celebrity with international attention			0
' the owner can expect to be invited on national television shows and to be guests at all kinds of events , bringing attention to loving and rescuing dogs who are not always the first chosen			0
