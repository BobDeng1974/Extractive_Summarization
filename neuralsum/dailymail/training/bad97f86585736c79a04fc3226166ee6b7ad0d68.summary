it ’s the multi-talented kitchen appliance which boasts thousands of loyal users around the world and now @entity4 ’s governor general wants one – but not everyone in the senate is clued - up on the @entity9 craze			1
the governor general ’s office put out a tender for $ 80,000 - $ 100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment during a @entity15 hearing on tuesday but @entity17 senator @entity16 was left baffled by one pricey item on the list			1
senator @entity16 read through the request for kitchen appliances for sir @entity23 ’ two residences - @entity24 in @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity28 – saying : ‘ you 're seeking four stick blenders , two food processors ... and you 're going to have to help me with this - a @entity9 ? ’ ‘ i do n't know what a @entity9 is , ’ senator @entity16 said			1
‘ a kitchen aid mixer , an upright freezer , a deep fryer and a pasta machine			0
and what 's a @entity54 ? , ’ he continued			0
the governor general 's official secretary , @entity40 , confessed : ‘ i do n't know what a @entity9 is			1
’ ‘ so there are a couple of us who do n't know what a @entity9 is , ’ senator @entity16 announced			1
attempting to fill the @entity15 's @entity62 in on the almost $ 2,000 kitchen toy , senator @entity34 explained : ‘ they 're very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today			2
’ the @entity67 - designed ' twelve appliances in one ' device has an almost cult - like following			1
they can not be bought in stores , and shoppers hold ' @entity9 parties ' similar to @entity75 parties where a @entity9 consultant comes out to a customer 's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends			0
there are more than 3000 @entity9 consultants across @entity4			0
‘ is that the elite trendies that use that , are they ? ’ asked @entity84			0
the @entity67 - designed ' twelve appliances in one ' device called a @entity9 has an almost cult - like following south @entity36 senator @entity34 described the @entity9 as ' very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today ' ‘ in @entity48 , you may refer to them as that , i just refer to them as those who have a particular interest in cooking , ’ senator @entity34 retorted			1
noticing he ’d touched a nerve , senator @entity16 probed : ‘ is that the new model or the old model ? ’ ' i 'm no @entity100 myself all i know is that my team and with the expert advice of kitchen consultants have given us advice on the sorts of things our kitchen requires in order for it to function properly ' mr @entity40 said			2
senator @entity16 then took the opportunity to point out how much the governor general ’s office is spending elsewhere			1
' you have $ 168,000 spent on redundancies , one involuntary , you have a request for a speechwriter and a media advisor … the previous governor general managed not to require them			2
‘ and now you have a couple hundred thousand spent on that amount , plus an additional amount on kitchen appliances			2
you wonder where the priorities are , ’ he said			0
but mr @entity40 reasoned that they need the new kitchen appliances to maintain the ‘ heritage properties ’			0
‘ we 're seeking to do so in the most efficient manner possible hence we 're seeking to replace 14 kitchen items , ’ he said .			0
