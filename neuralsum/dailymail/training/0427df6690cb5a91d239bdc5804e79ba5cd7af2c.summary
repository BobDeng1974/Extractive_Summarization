@entity0 will return to @entity1 more determined than ever to maintain the form which earned a surprise @entity4 recall			1
@entity0 is not deterred by @entity7 's decision to take him off at half - time in the 3 - 1 win in @entity10 after 45 minutes when he worked hard but struggled to get on the ball or impose his creative quality			1
he knows there will be critics who are quick to write off his chances of adding to his 35 caps but he has four months to persuade @entity7 with his performances for @entity1 before the next @entity4 squad is selected for games against @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity0 is determined to keep his place in @entity7 's @entity4 squad @entity7 gives instructions to @entity0 and his @entity4 team - mate during a training session last week @entity0 said : ' it is all about people ’s opinions			1
as long as i am picked and playing then i am happy			2
that is enough for me			2
everyone has an opinion in the world of football			0
of those picked last night ( wednesday ) some will think he should be in or it should be him and so on			0
that is just the way people talk but i am happy to be back in the squad and just have to stay there now			0
' it was good to be out there and play some minutes and good to be back			1
' now it 's the same for everyone			2
you need to keep playing well to be picked			0
that ’s what the manager said to the players after the game			0
carry on your form to be picked so i ’ll go back to @entity1 and try to carry on playing the way i have been playing and hopefully that will be enough to be in the next squad			1
' @entity0 's @entity4 return - it was his first cap for two and a half years - was not helped by injury			1
he took a knock on a knee last week and aggravated the problem during the warm - up ahead of the @entity65 game on saturday			2
although he remained on the team sheet among the substitutes at @entity68 he was not fit to come on			0
the 30 - year - old winger has been in brilliant form for @entity1 so far this season he was passed a fitness test in @entity10 but was probably less than 100 per cent			1
@entity0 said : ' i had not trained all week but was passed fit to play and was just happy to get out there and play 45 minutes			1
i came through it and should be ok for this weekend ’s game for @entity1			1
' there ’s a bit of swelling on the knee but it ’s just a bang			0
i was fit to play and i was fine			0
' @entity7 deployed @entity0 on the left of a midfield trio , but much of his impressive form for @entity1 has come in the @entity83 role			1
his versatility can work against as well as for him			0
' it would be nice to nail a position down but the way we have been playing at @entity1 , it has suited me to play in that no. 10 role			1
i can play in the left of the three too			0
with the players we have with @entity4 , obviously it is going to be difficult playing at no. 10 if i am honest			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring a late equaliser against @entity96 during the 2 - 2 @entity98 draw ' @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 can play there - so you ’ll probably see me playing more on the left of the three			1
that ’s where i think i will get the chance to play the most			0
' i think we have got good flexibility			2
we were trying to get into the back of the @entity10 midfield really			2
it was difficult because obviously they were pressing hard us at times			0
but the first goal settled us and the quality shone through with the goals we scored			0
' it is nice to go away with a good win			2
a lot of people had us down to lose this game after @entity10 won last week			2
that was a big motivation factor for us			0
the first goal was crucial because it settled us down and i think we played some nice football			2
@entity0 made his first start for @entity4 in two - and - a - half years and was hooked after 45 minutes ' the team took a lot of stick from the @entity130 but have bounced back very well			1
' from a personal perspective , the 30 - year - old was simply glad to be back in an @entity4 shirt , nearly a decade after his debut			1
@entity0 said : ' i have been out of the squad for a long time , two and a half years			1
i did not think i would be picked again but it ’s just so nice to be back in it			0
not many players are picked after such a gap			0
' but it just goes to show that if you keep playing well , there is always the chance of being recalled			0
you ’ve just got to play well for your club and you never know			0

@entity0 hoping to maintain good form with @entity1

30 - year - old admits he did *n't* expect @entity4 recall
