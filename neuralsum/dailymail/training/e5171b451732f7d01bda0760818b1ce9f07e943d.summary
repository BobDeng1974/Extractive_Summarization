by @entity0 published : 20:27 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 10 december 2013 millions of women are being let down by a state pension system that treats them like ‘ poor relations ’ , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the data from the @entity7 show that 80 per cent of male pensioners get the full amount of £ 110.15 a week			1
but just 46 per cent of women receive the full state pension , which is based on national insurance contributions			1
official statistics show just 46 % of women receive the full state pension compared to 80 % of male pensioners many women give up work to look after children and so make lower contributions			1
dr @entity19 , a pensions expert , said : ‘ the state pension system was designed by men for men who had wives at home			1
‘ women have been stung by a legacy of rough justice from the pension system			2
it has discriminated against women for years			0
’ overall , a typical retired woman who is receiving her state pension , including additional extras , receives £ 112 per week			2
but a man scoops £ 34 more per week , with an average weekly payout of £ 146			0
this is equal to nearly £ 1,770 more every year			0
many women give up work to look after children and therefore make lower contributions for many women , this is the difference between turning on the heating or staying cold , between visiting relatives or being stuck at home			1
@entity45 , a consultant from pension advisers @entity47 , said : ‘ it is clear that women are still very much the poor relations when it comes to the state pension			1
’ there are far more female than male pensioners in @entity55 , with around five million men and 7.3million women over state pension age in the @entity55			1
to make matters worse , the @entity7 said one in ten retired women get ‘ less than half ’ of the basic state pension			1
the figures follow the revelation yesterday that elderly savers are being stripped of thousands of pounds by middlemen when they retire and turn their pension pots into annuities			0
half stay loyal to the insurer they have saved with while others turn to brokers in search of a better deal			0
but a report from the @entity77 found many pensioners were being charged between £ 1,500 and £ 3,350 by brokers when moving a pot worth £ 100,000			0
the @entity7 also exposed the ballooning cost of paying the state pension to @entity55 ’s ageing population			1
in 2012/13 , the state pension and other payouts , such as pension credit , cost the government £ 94billion			2
this figure is set to explode as people live longer			0
two in five baby girls born this year will live to celebrate their 100th birthdays , according to the @entity92			0
pensions experts say the state system was ' designed by men for men ' and discriminate against women by 2062/63 , the @entity7 forecasts the bill will have reached £ 438billion , a sum the government plans to reduce by raising the state pension age			1
at present a woman can start claiming state pension at 61 and nine months			2
a man can start claiming at 65			0
it will be increased to 65 for women by 2018			0
the age for both men and women will then rise to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028			0
@entity110 , director of the pension provider @entity111 , said : ‘ we all know @entity55 is facing a pensions timebomb			2
‘ with these official projections , the ticking just got louder			0

@entity7 show 80 % of male pensioners get full amount
fewer than one in two women get full state pension , which is based on @entity124 contributions
many women make lower contributions because they give up work
pensions experts say system ' discriminates ' against women
