' mistake ' : @entity1 has removed the t - shirts from its stores following the outcry fashion chain @entity1 has been slammed by @entity6 groups over a graphic ‘ sinners ’ t - shirt which depicts women as sex objects and uses @entity11 references			1
a @entity14 storm has erupted over the shirt with one blogger even claiming the shirt , image and message effectively condones rape			0
the t - shirt carries the headline ‘ @entity27 ’ above the seductive image of a woman in black underwear lying on a bed			1
the image is surrounded by a series of slogans which read : ‘ @entity31 – seize the @entity27 and all it may hold ’ finally , there is a long smallprint passage which carries a number of definitions of sin including one from the @entity11 from epistle to the @entity38 , chapter seven			2
@entity40 , of @entity41 , contacted next via its official @entity43 page to complain about the t - shirt			1
he asked : ‘ why are you marketing graphic @entity46 with misogynistic poses of women in underwear and promoting such images using @entity11 ? ’ mr @entity40 said : ‘ the image itself is very unhelpful			1
it gives a message about availability and vulnerability of women			0
they are then using the word sin and words from the @entity11 to suggest this is both naughty but nice			2
‘ the whole concept is wrong - headed and demeaning to women			1
human dignity should be cherished and women should not be reduced to the level of an object			0
’ a number of @entity6 and non-religious individuals joined the condemnation using @entity14 and personal blogs			0
one female blogger complained the image was effectively soft core pornography that was more the remit of a top shelf magazine than a family store			0
she said the woman was presented as simply being available for a man ’s sexual pleasure			0
boss : @entity76 is chief executive of the @entity1 chain of stores most controversially , she described the lines ‘ @entity31 – seize the night and all it may hold ’ as a rape fantasy slogan			2
the issue of rape has been headline news in recent weeks with comments from the @entity87 mp @entity86 and a leading @entity89 politician apparently attempting to downplay the @entity90 suggested the women alleging rape against the @entity94 founder @entity93 should not be believed.the blogger wrote in an open letter to @entity1 : ‘ in the wake of the summer of rape apologists - @entity90 , @entity93 et al - the very last thing we need are t - shirts that tell people that a woman is theirs for the seizing			1
’ other @entity6 commentators on @entity14 condemned the t - shirt ’s images and messages , but rejected any suggestion it condoned rape			1
director of the @entity113 , @entity114 , criticised @entity1 for stocking the @entity115 said : ‘ it beggars belief that a company that has a well - established reputation as a respectable family store should be marketing such a cheap and tawdry product that demeans women and encourages a casual attitude to sex			1
‘ we hope that @entity1 will think again and take the socially responsible step of withdrawing this product rather than risk having its good name dragged through the gutter			0
’ @entity1 is run by @entity76 , who is a prominent supporter of the conservative party and was made a life peer by @entity132 ’s government			0
last night the company admitted it had been a mistake to stock the @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 has received some customer complaints regarding a man ’s t shirt and sweatshirt			2
on reflection we agree it was a mistake for us to sell these garments and we are therefore removing them from sale			0
