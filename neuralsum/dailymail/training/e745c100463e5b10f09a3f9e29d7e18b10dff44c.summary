@entity0 insisted the perilous financial position at @entity2 does not make him immune from the sack			1
but the @entity5 boss remains confident he can overcome current criticism and fulfil his remit by guiding the club back into top - flight football			1
@entity0 has been on the receiving end of heavy flak after monday evening ’s grim 3 - 1 home defeat from @entity13 left @entity2 six points adrift of @entity15			1
@entity0 claims that no manager is completely safe from losing his job some fans have questioned whether the settlement package due on his current £ 400,000 per year earnings simply makes his dismissal too expensive for the board to consider			1
the @entity5 outfit were forced to launch a stop - gap £ 3.13million share issue last month and could face another cash shortfall by the end of the year			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t think anyone is bombproof			1
i would n’t sit here for a minute and say i ’m bombproof			2
i ’m still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof			2
’ asked if suggestions that he was only still in place for financial reasons were hurtful , @entity0 replied : ‘ i do n’t find that insulting at all			1
i do n’t necessarily agree with it			0
i do n’t think there has ever been a manager at all who has n’t been sackable			2
sections of the @entity5 faithful jeered their team after the shock 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity13 ‘ so i do n’t think about that at all and it does n’t annoy me that people have said it			1
i ’ve got far too much on my mind , concentrating on the positives and moving forward			0
’ former players and pundits have delivered scathing critiques of @entity0 ’s tenure this week , with @entity57 midfielder @entity56 accusing him of failing to coach his players properly			2
‘ i am not going to sit here and tell you it ’s enjoyable when you are getting stick , ’ said the 52 - year - old , who declined to address any individual remarks			2
‘ of course it ’s not			0
but i have a real acceptance that it goes with the territory			0
if @entity68 can get @entity69 , get to the @entity70 final and get dog ’s abuse then it is fair to say that we will get our fair share of criticism			0
i just want to get the job done			0
’ @entity13 star @entity78 celebrates his second goal in front of the @entity2 fans the @entity13 reverse followed an earlier victory for @entity15 at @entity5 , but @entity0 sees no need for panic as he takes his team to @entity87 this afternoon			1
‘ i accept that criticism is going to come with the two defeats , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is my job to do something about that			0
we are less than a fifth into the season			0
there are miles and miles to go			0
‘ it is important that we do n’t get carried away after good performances			0
and i am not going to get too upset after a 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity13			1
i made a point of checking and , in 2010 , we had a team that had nine guys who played in the @entity70 final that lost 3 - 0 to @entity13 at home			1
three years before , @entity99 scored a hat - trick for @entity13 in another 3 - 0 loss			1
‘ now that is not a fob - off			0
we were beaten 3 - 1 , we had a mad 20 minutes , we need to do something about it			1
but it is not unique			0
@entity2 will be without @entity116 ( r ) at the weekend after he was banned for lashing out at @entity117 ‘ there is nothing that ’s happened this season which has shocked us			2
we knew right from the word go it was a step up			0
’ the @entity124 play - offs would provide a back - up option if @entity2 fail to close the gap on @entity15			1
‘ getting out of the division is the most important thing , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ we will take whatever we can to get out of this division because it is so important for the club to get back into the top flight as soon as possible			0
