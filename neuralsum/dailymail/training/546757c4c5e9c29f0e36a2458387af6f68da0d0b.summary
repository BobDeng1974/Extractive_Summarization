by @entity0 @entity5 , when telegrams were a popular means of communication , @entity1 boasted their own telegraphic address : ‘ @entity7 — @entity8 ’			1
the years passed and telegrams fell from favour , yet still they clung to the same distinctive title			0
it seemed a snug fit for that raffish enclave on the @entity15 ; a haven in which success was relished , failure was tolerated and laughter was guaranteed			0
not so much an address , more a state of mind			0
@entity1 is the place where they erected a preposterous statue to @entity25 because he was a chum of the last chairman			1
down by the river : @entity29 has seen its fair share of drama throughout the years bad : former owner @entity33 poses in front of the statue of @entity25 it is the club where , long ago , a blissfully under - talented winger named @entity38 was booked for swearing at his captain , the great @entity39			1
‘ but he ’s on my side ! ’ he complained			1
‘ i can call him anything i bleeding like ! ’ quite recently , a fans ’ forum was asked to define ‘ @entity7 ’			1
one contributor suggested : ‘ the ability to mock one ’s own and to find humour in shameful circumstances			1
’ another offered : ‘ in the @entity52 at @entity29 , singing “ let ’s all cheer for @entity55 ” because they ’d only brought 20 fans			1
then , naturally , @entity55 scored			0
’ famous faces : @entity1 old boys @entity60 ( top left ) , @entity38 ( top right ) , @entity61 ( below ( left ) and @entity62 ( below right ) but one fan expressed his fears with considerable candour : ‘ perhaps we have drifted from being @entity7 to rubbish - ish , ’ he said			1
what @entity68 makes of it all , i really can not imagine			1
@entity72 is the third manager @entity1 have tried this season , the last one , @entity71 , having lasted 75 days and 17 games			1
the new man came wading through carnage at the cottage , following the dismissals of the coaches @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
show of emotion : @entity68 was put through the mill on his first match as @entity1 boss the chairman , @entity89 , owns an american football team called the @entity91			1
he paid tribute to the departed quintet in these words : ‘ i ’m very grateful to @entity71 , @entity80 and @entity81 , as well as @entity82 and @entity83 , for their commitment to @entity1			1
their efforts were admirable and appreciated and i wish them the best			0
’ it was a classic of effortless insincerity			2
the appointment of @entity68 , who has not worked in management since october 2012 , represents @entity89 ’s final shot at getting it right			2
the mass sackings , and consequent compensation bills , were gestures which only a billionaire could afford			0
some of his surviving senior employees may have privately queried the wisdom of allowing @entity71 to buy five players on deadline day , including an £ 11million @entity115 striker , then firing the manager three weeks later			2
but , since @entity89 pays the bills , they never raised their voices			0
and anyway , the future belongs to @entity68			2
this is a man who , in the course of a substantial managerial career , has acquired a reputation for being a pitiless trainer ; drive them hard , success through sweat			0
it is a notion he does not discourage			0
a few of @entity1 ’s underachievers will have winced at his much - quoted justification : ‘ until now , everyone has lived through my training			1
’ pedigree : @entity68 won the @entity140 cup during his stint with @entity142 tough taskmaster : @entity68 leads @entity142 players in training before defeat to @entity147 in the 2005 @entity149 quarter - final he is doubtless aware that such an attitude will win him public favour , since the public perceives footballers as being both overpaid and underworked			1
and yet @entity68 needs to be much more than a martinet if @entity1 ’s survival is to be achieved			1
just about every gym in the country contains people capable of pushing athletes to their limits ; it takes the talents of a teacher , an educator , an innovative coach to improve the skills which deliver results			0
soon , we shall discover if @entity68 possesses those qualities , or if his hard - driving reputation represents the real man			1
‘ i ’m a nice guy			2
i ’m very nice , ’ he insisted , with the smirk of a pantomime villain			2
@entity173 , one of his former players , said : ‘ i understand where his critics are coming from but to call him @entity177 is a bit strong , ’ which is possibly not quite the compliment he intended			2
but the recent remark of @entity182 , the renowned @entity140 international forward and current president of @entity142 , remains curiously disturbing			0
@entity182 , who once worked with @entity68 at @entity142 , said : ‘ i would never want to treat human beings the way he does			1
by the middle of may , they could be raising a statue to @entity68 in the place where @entity25 once stood			1
or the chap from the @entity91 could be forming a new firing squad			0
because of what the club have been and what they have meant to the @entity199 game , we must wish them well			0
but we must also be forgiven a small shudder at the behaviour of those who are in @entity203 , pragmatic , uncompromising methods may go down well in certain @entity206 boardrooms			1
but they are neither humane nor admirable			0
and they are certainly not fulhamish			0
the most disturbing image of the sporting week was that of @entity211 waving an imaginary card and frantically pleading for the booking of a @entity215 player			2
at the time , @entity216 were being slaughtered by a side playing with style and flair and exhilarating freedom			0
@entity211 looked like a man trying to open a brolly in a hurricane			2
later , after @entity216 had been soundly beaten , he would launch into a ludicrous diatribe against the referee			0
he was ‘ not impartial ’			2
worst of all , he was @entity226			0
‘ it was not a good idea to put a referee from @entity226 in charge of such an important match , ’ said @entity211 , with the desperate air of one who does not really expect to be taken seriously			1
now , this is standard behaviour for the managerial tribe , whose members stagger along that fine line between sanity and chaos			0
losing it : @entity211 's @entity216 were slaughtered by @entity215 in the @entity149 yellow peril : @entity211 was not impressed with @entity243 ( right ) even @entity244 , the very best of them , can succumb to hand - fluttering outrage , as he did when losing his goalkeeper to a stern but defensible decision in @entity251 ’s tie with @entity142			1
yet @entity211 ’s tantrum was particularly disturbing , since it hinted at an unsuspected weakness in a substantial man			2
sixty years old , a graduate in civil engineering , he retired from a distinguished playing career to work in reconstruction projects in the @entity260 earthquake zone			1
his subsequent managerial journey took him to some of the biggest clubs in @entity264 , @entity260 and @entity265			0
he is a proper coach who builds proper teams			0
and yet , just a few weeks back , he seemed rattled by the puerile provocations of @entity268			0
it was unclear why this formidable man should be affected by the taunts of such a tedious troll but @entity147 ’s @entity149 victory at the @entity274 created the kind of tremulous uncertainty that even @entity216 ’s subsequent @entity278 success could not erase			0
of course , he has time to demonstrate that the card - waving was not a trend but a lapse			2
yet it remains an unsettling image			0
we had hoped that @entity211 was immune to that kind of nonsense			2
we now know that he is as mad as all the rest			0
@entity288 is to join @entity289 for @entity291 ’s forthcoming tour of the @entity292			1
the mantle of @entity294 and @entity295 thus falls upon a former spinner and full - time ‘ character ’ who deserted the @entity291 team after they lost the first three @entity298 of the @entity300 tour			1
coming to the airwaves : @entity288 ( right ) will join the @entity289 team when the @entity292 tour a @entity306 executive promises : ‘ @entity288 will bring genuine insight to the audience … as well as his trademark sense of humour			1
’ the idea of inflicting that ‘ trademark sense of humour ’ upon @entity289 listeners is truly dispiriting			1
still , there is always the chance that , after three matches , he will be on his way .			0

now on their third manager of the season , will @entity1 erect a statue of @entity68 come may ?
ruthless , pragmatic , uncompromising methods may go down well in certain @entity206 boardrooms . but that is not @entity1 's way
@entity211 has a degree in civil engineering but was reduced to rabble - rousing in *midweek*
the idea of inflicting @entity288 's ‘ trademark sense of humour ’ upon @entity289 listeners is truly dispiriting
