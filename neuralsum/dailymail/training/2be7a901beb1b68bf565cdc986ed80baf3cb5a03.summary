the handset is expected to be revealed in september			0
the @entity1 6 featured a new 8 - megapixel isight camera			2

' the specific thing i heard is that next years camera might be the biggest camera jump ever , ' he said			0
' i do n't even know what sense this makes , but i 've heard that it 's some kind of weird two - lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into dslr quality imagery			1
' @entity46 's most recent phone , the @entity47 , also comes with two lenses so that you can add @entity50 effects to photos			0
however , @entity2 's approach is believes to be designed to add quality to pictures rather than create special effects			1
