@entity0 vowed to crush @entity10 ’s ‘ 1970s - style socialism ’ yesterday as he put tax cuts , enterprise and opportunity at the heart of an election campaign to reprise the @entity6 ’ defeat of @entity8			1
the prime minister condemned @entity19 ’s ‘ damaging , nonsensical , twisted economic policy ’ and scoffed at what he called ‘ @entity10 and his @entity14 economy ’ – saying it would heap ruin on @entity17			1
in an annual conference speech shorn of policy gimmicks and rhetorical flourishes , he repeatedly asked voters to allow the @entity24 to ‘ finish the job ’ of turning @entity17 around			1
but in an echo of the 1992 election campaign , the last time the @entity6 won power outright , mr @entity0 signalled a relentless focus on @entity19 ’s lack of credibility on the economy – attacking both mr @entity10 and @entity49			1
he spoke of wanting to create a ‘ land of opportunity for all ’ – an echo of slogans used by @entity53 in 1987 and @entity54 in 1992			1
vow : mr @entity0 signalled a relentless focus on @entity57 s lack of credibility on the economy ¿ attacking both @entity10 and @entity49 hope : in his speech , the prime minister claimed the ¿ land of hope is @entity24 ¿ while ¿ the land of despair was @entity19 ¿ the @entity24 have already announced that fuel duty is likely to be frozen until the election and pledged to introduce a £ 1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples			1
mr @entity0 pointed out that the @entity69 had also cut taxes for 25million basic - rate taxpayers by raising personal tax allowances			1
and in an indication that the @entity24 ’s next manifesto will pledge to raise the tax allowance still higher , he declared : ‘ we ’re @entity6 , we believe in low taxes			2
and believe me – we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard - working people			0
’ ' we 're @entity6 , we believe in low taxes			2
and believe me – we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard - working people			0
' @entity0 @entity24 strategists believe mr @entity10 made a major blunder in his speech last week by shifting decisively to the @entity84 , proposing 1970s - style price fixing in the energy market , state seizures of undeveloped land and penalties for businesses who fail to take on trainees			1
in his 50 - minute address , mr @entity0 said @entity19 had comprehensively lost the economic argument and it was clear to all that the economy was ‘ turning the corner ’			1
he said : ‘ there was a time when i ’d look across to @entity49 and he was shouting his head off , screaming that the economy was flatlining with such glee			2
' but recently , it ’s gone a bit quiet			0
could it be because there was no double dip and the economy ’s growing ? ’ key note speech : mr @entity0 and his wife @entity110 wave to crowds following his address mr @entity0 said the last government had left behind a ‘ casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system ’			1
business , he pointed out , had already created 1.4million new jobs since the last election and must be helped , not deterred			0
‘ profit , wealth creation , tax cuts , enterprise : these are not dirty , elitist words – they ’re not the problem , they are the solution , because it ’s not government that creates jobs , it ’s businesses			0
‘ you do n’t do this job to be popular			2
you do it because you love your country			0
i do the best i can			0
' @entity0 ' i know that bashing business might play to a @entity19 audience			2
but it ’s crazy for our country			0
’ mr @entity0 said he knew voters were asking whether the ‘ struggle ’ of the past few years of austerity had all been worth it			1
he said : ‘ here ’s the honest answer : the struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we ’ve started			2
’ to abandon deficit reduction now would throw away ‘ all the progress we ’ve made ’ , the prime minister insisted			2
‘ how did they [ @entity19 ] get us into this mess ? ' too much spending , too much borrowing , too much debt			0
and what did they propose last week ? ‘ more spending , more borrowing , more debt			0
@entity165 : mr @entity0 's speech echoed a 1987 speech from then pm @entity53 history repeating ? the @entity6 last won an election outright with a similar sentiment - one that saw @entity54 's conservatives beat off a challenge from @entity8 's @entity19 ' they have learned nothing – literally nothing – from the crisis they created			1
’ he dismissed mr @entity10 ’s promises to cut the cost of living as ‘ all sticking plasters and quick fixes ’			1
acknowledging spending cuts had been unpopular , mr @entity0 added : ‘ you do n’t do this job to be popular			1
you do it because you love your country			0
i do the best i can			0
' @entity19 have learned nothing – literally nothing – from the crisis they created			0
' @entity0 ' and for me it comes back to some simple things – country first , do what ’s decent , think long - term			2
’ it was not enough simply to clean up @entity19 ’s economic ‘ mess ’ and pay off the deficit , he said , the @entity24 wanted to ‘ build something better in its place ’			0
the @entity24 leader also sought to march onto centre - ground territory , where his party has traditionally found it difficult to make inroads against @entity19 – promising to drive industrial regeneration in the @entity208 and positioning the @entity6 as the true defenders of the @entity210			2
listening : ( left - right ) @entity212 , @entity213 , and @entity214 listen intently to mr @entity0 's speech support : @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 applaud following mr @entity0 's speech after the scandal of the @entity224 hospital trust , where hundreds of patients died , the @entity24 would take no lectures from @entity19 on the @entity210 , he said			1
he even praised the ‘ noble calling ’ of social work – promising to get more top - flight graduates into the profession			2
and the prime minister sought to assure @entity24 troops that he is fighting for a majority @entity24 government , not another power - sharing administration with the @entity235			0
@entity236 , head of the @entity237 , said mr @entity0 had ‘ sent out a strong message about how vital @entity17 business is to the future prosperity of people across the @entity17 ’			1
but @entity19 vice-chairman @entity242 said : ‘ there ’s a cost - of - living crisis and he ’s got nothing to say about it			0
‘ rather than standing up for hard - working people he has always puts a privileged few first , prioritising a tax cut for those earning over £ 150,000 while everyone else pays more			0
’ mr @entity0 was joined by wife @entity110 on stage as his audience gave him a standing ovation			1
the pair left the auditorium to the sound of @entity255 ’s @entity256 , used by @entity257 during his successful campaign in 1992			0
focus : the @entity24 are already turning their attention towards the next election job done : walking hand - in - hand with wife @entity110 , @entity0 looks pleased with his speech as he shakes the hand of a supporter @entity53 was the greatest peacetime prime minister @entity17 ever had , @entity0 said yesterday			1
conservatives this year ‘ said goodbye to one of our team , ’ he told a packed hall at the party conference in @entity36			0
he hailed the achievements of the @entity277 , who died in april this year			0
greatest : @entity53 memorabilia on sale at this year 's @entity24 conference mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity53 made our country stand tall again , at home and abroad			1
’ he went on to list some of her many achievements : ‘ rescuing our economy , giving power to our people , spreading home ownership , creating work , winning the @entity290 , saving the @entity291			2
’ he also revealed how he had sat next to her at dinner once and had been very nervous to speak to her			0
mr @entity0 asked her about her record and told how she had been ‘ totally charming ’ and had ‘ put me at ease ’			1
but when he asked the @entity298 what she would do differently if she had her time in government again , she replied : ‘ you know , i think i did pretty well the first time around			0
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ we can all agree with that and we can all agree with this – she was the greatest peacetime prime minister our country has ever had			1

the pm scoffed at what he called ' @entity10 and his @entity14 economy '
voters asked for chance to ' finish the job ' of turning @entity17 around
he described the prospect of a @entity69 as a ' land of despair '
echoing @entity54 and @entity277 , @entity0 spoke of ' land of opportunity for all '
the under - 25s may be stripped of state benefits unless they ‘ earn or learn ’
mr @entity0 conceded it was a mistake to ignore grass - roots *opposition* and force through *gay* marriage laws
@entity328 branded @entity332 ‘ *racists* ’ and warned @entity6 to scrap ideas of an electoral deal .
