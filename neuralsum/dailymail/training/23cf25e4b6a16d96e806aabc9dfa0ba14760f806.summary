a sex abuse victim who was forced by his neighbour to act out @entity3 scenes when he was just nine years old has finally received justice after he bumped into his grinning abuser more than 30 years later			1
taxi driver @entity6 , 45 , was abused at the hands of @entity8 , then 15 , who would hold his victim in a headlock , before forcing him to carry out sickening acts as he cried for mercy			1
the father - of - two , from @entity15 , south @entity16 , always kept what happened a secret but was traumatised by the abuse his entire life			1
justice : @entity6 , 45 ( pictured left ) reported his abuser @entity8 ( right ) to police three decades after being abused - after he bumped into him on the street in @entity16 but , in 2012 , mr @entity6 unexpectedly walked past @entity24 in the street			1
sickeningly , @entity24 grinned at mr @entity6 , as if nothing had happened			1
the incident infuriated mr @entity6 so much that he told his mother about the abuse , before reporting it to police			1
last year , @entity24 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , was finally convicted of four counts of indecent assault , one of attempted buggery and one of indecency with a child			1
he said : ' it 's nothing compared to the 37 - year sentence i 've served , but i now know i did the right thing by reporting him			2
' the monster had just smiled at me as if nothing had happened			2
it made me sick to my stomach			2
it made me realise how much destruction it has caused all through my life - all because of him			2
' now @entity8 is paying for what he did and , hopefully , he 'll never be able to abuse another child again			1
' the abuse began when mr @entity6 , then nine , was living a few doors away from @entity24 , who was a friend of mr @entity6 's older brother , @entity54			1
mr @entity6 , pictured as a child , was just nine years old when the abuse began when @entity24 began inviting mr @entity6 over to play along with his brother , he was thrilled to have a new , older friend			1
he was also fascinated by all the state - of - the art toys @entity24 had at his home , something mr @entity6 and his brothers never had			1
he said : ' i remember looking around @entity8 's front room			1
i felt like i 'd just stepped into @entity65 's cave			2
' @entity8 asked me what i wanted to have a go on			1
it was every nine - year - old boy 's dream			2
it was like another world			2
i felt so grateful he did n't mind me tagging along			2
' but the abuse started when @entity24 asked mr @entity6 to visit his house alone			1
on that first occasion , @entity24 asked mr @entity6 to touch him - and gave him £ 3 when he did			1
' he said we could play table football			2
i left @entity77 and @entity54 behind and went to @entity8 's on my own			1
' his mum was in the kitchen			2
but as we started playing the footie game in the living room something odd happened			2
' he asked me to touch him intimately			2
i supposed it was normal and did n't want to be seen like a baby so did it			2
afterwards he gave me £ 3			2
i thought it was what lads did			2
' another afternoon , @entity24 forced mr @entity6 onto his knees and made him perform a sex act on him			1
' once he 'd finished with me , he 'd give me money and let me go			2
he threatened to kill me if i told anyone , ' he said			2
' i felt so worthless , but i was just a frightened child , did n't know what to do			2
' mr @entity6 said that he would beg @entity24 to stop , but the abuse continued			1
he said : ' most of the time we played in his bedroom			0
it would always end with @entity8 forcing me to touch him as i cried			1
' he even had a calendar of the @entity3 and would make me pick positions from it to try			0
then he 'd violently wrestle me into the pose			0
' if i refused he 'd put me in a headlock , choke me until i almost passed out			1
so i went along with it			0
' mr @entity6 , from @entity15 , ( pictured left and right ) has been left traumatised by the abuse he suffered then , when mr @entity6 was just ten , @entity24 tried to rape him			1
he said : ' i was in agony			0
i somehow managed to fight him off			0
i made a decision there and then			0
' i was going to stay away from @entity8			1
so i began taking the long way to school and avoided @entity8 's house			1
i stopped playing out with my friends , just in case he walked by			0
' soon after , @entity24 moved away to @entity32			1
although mr @entity6 was relived , he was plagued by what had happened			1
when he was 19 , he met a woman , with whom he had twin daughters			0
but that relationship soon broke down			0
after another failed relationship , mr @entity6 moved back in with his mother			1
he said : ' my memories chained me to the past			0
they made me feel foolish and dirty			0
' i tried to start again and aged 19 , i met a girl and we had twin daughters			0
the four of us should 've been so happy but i could n't forget my childhood			0
' it affected me so much more than i thought			0
i just could n't get close to anyone			0
' the whole time , mr @entity6 was burdened by what had happened , unable to speak with anyone about it , even his mother			1
' i 'd never told her the truth , ' he said			0
' i was terrified it would kill her , knowing she had failed to protect me from the predator on our doorstep			0
' but everything changed when mr @entity6 was walking along the road in 2012 and bumped into @entity24			1
the attacker had come to visit a former neighbour on the street on which the pair used to live			1
he grinned at his victim as he walked past the driveway			0
@entity24 even parked his campervan right outside mr @entity6 's home			1
' i was so furious			0
it was awful , ' mr @entity6 said , ' especially when he parked his campervan outside my mum 's			1
' i remember pacing up and down the living room , not knowing what to do			0
then i stuck a note on his campervan , threatening him to go away			0
i just wanted him to go			0
' a few months later , mr @entity6 decided to tell his mother about what had happened			1
unable to talk about it , he left her a letter instead			0
he said : ' she was distraught			0
my mum was a tough woman , from the era of " just plough on " , but this stopped her in her tracks			0
' i wrote a note because i could not tell her			0
then i went out for an hour , saw the letter had been read and she was sat there with her head in her hands			0
' i wanted her to understand me			0
it 's not an excuse , but i just wanted to understand why i was how i was			0
' knowing the stress any court case would have on her , mr @entity6 vowed only to go to the police after she died			1
two months later , she died suddenly from a massive brain aneurysm			0
' they said there was no way of knowing but i thought the stress of knowing what @entity8 had done had probably killed mum , ' mr @entity6 said			1
in september 2014 @entity24 , then 50 , appeared at @entity187 charged with four counts of indecent assault , one of attempted buggery and one of indecency with a child			1
he pleaded not guilty but was convicted and jailed for three years he said : ' it was horrific , standing up in that dock , being accused of making it up			1
it 's just not a nice thing to face			0
' i did not even have a screen because i wanted to face him - i wanted him to see the damage he had done to me			0
and i wanted to give it back			0
' but now i can start moving on , trying to repair the damage he has done			0
i only wish i had reported him earlier			0
