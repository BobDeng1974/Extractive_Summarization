former pm @entity0 warned that leaving the @entity1 would turn @entity2 into @entity4 's @entity3 @entity2 would turn into the @entity5 if it left the @entity1 , @entity0 has claimed			1
in a bizarre warning ahead of a speech to the @entity9 tomorrow , the former prime minister said the @entity2 would be ' left out in the cold with few friends [ and ] no influence ' like the regime in @entity13			0
he rejects claims that @entity2 could succeed on its own by becoming an open , trading nation like @entity16 or @entity17			1
but the warning that @entity2 would fall into @entity3 isolationism is likely to spark ridicule			2
a report commissioned by @entity22 last year said leaving the @entity1 was ' definitely a viable option ' for the @entity2			1
mr @entity22 's chief economic adviser @entity24 said the best option was to stay in a reformed @entity1 – but if that could n't be achieved exit was better for the economy than the status quo			2
but in a startling intervention ahead of tomorrow 's @entity9 debate on the @entity1 , mr @entity0 said : ' we must tell the truth about the 3 million jobs , 25,000 companies , £ 200billion of annual exports and the £ 450billion of inward investment linked to @entity4			0

' our destiny is not a bit player on someone else 's stage , or a spectator hectoring from the wings , but always setting the agenda , bringing people together , and championing change			0
' he added : ' being half - in half - out , a @entity2 that is semi-detached and disengaged – the @entity2 of the empty chair even when we are in the room – has made us weaker than ever : irrelevant on @entity86 , fringe player on climate change , mere spectator in the debate that could have shaped a @entity5 pro-growth policy , marginal on @entity92 , with ministers sounding ludicrous as simultaneously they say : ' @entity94 must be confronted with a more united @entity4 ' , and : ' by the way , we are thinking of leaving			0
