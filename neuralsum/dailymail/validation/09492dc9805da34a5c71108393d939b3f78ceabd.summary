@entity1 aid money may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition , a damning report warns today			1
the study by the government ’s aid watchdog warns that a £ 52 million programme to help strengthen @entity10 ’s security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime			1
@entity1 aid money was used to train detectives in tracking mobile phones and analysing call data – skills which researchers warned could be used to ‘ monitor and suppress political opposition groups ’ in the country where corruption is endemic			1
a report claims @entity1 aid money may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition			1
pictured : police stand guard following demonstrations in the @entity27 the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) initially said the officers involved were not involved in political activity			2
but when the @entity32 warned it would go public on its concerns , the project was scrapped			2
@entity28 last night insisted there was ‘ no evidence ’ that funding had been misused			1
the commission ’s report reveals that @entity28 also funded training for the @entity10 police in taking fingerprints - including fingerprinting 40,000 convicted prisoners			1
but researchers questioned the value of the scheme in a country where fingerprint evidence is not admissible in court			1
the new study raised widespread concerns about the use of @entity1 aid to help so - called fragile states strengthen their police and security services			1
in @entity58 , a programme to strengthen local police had to be abandoned in 2013 amid concerns about police brutality towards street children			0
in the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) a similar programme was scrapped last year after a @entity64 report accused the @entity27 national police of involvement in illegal killings			0
today ’s study gives the overall programme its second - lowest ‘ amber - red ’ rating , meaning that it is performing ‘ relatively poorly ’ , with ‘ significant improvements ’ needed to achieve value for money			1
the report acknowledges the importance of trying to improve policing in some of the world ’s poorest countries , where corruption and police brutality are often rife			2
the study by the government ’s aid watchdog warns that a £ 52 million programme to help strengthen @entity10 ’s security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime but it says that @entity28 ’s projects are ‘ not making enough of a difference to the lives of the poor ’			1
watchdog chief @entity94 said a ‘ significant rethink ’ was now needed to make the projects ‘ more realistic and effective ’			0
the study was scathing about a project to build ‘ model police stations ’ in a range of countries , including @entity101 , @entity10 , @entity102 , @entity103 and the @entity27			1
the initiative was meant to raise standards by establishing beacons of good policing			0
the new ‘ model ’ stations were given extra cash for training and equipment			0
in @entity10 , 15 of the new police stations were built			2
but the report finds that ‘ perceptions of police performance are , by most measures , worse in model police stations than the national average ’			0
the proportion of people saying they have been the victim of crime increased by 48 per cent in the period , while the proportion forced to pay bribes to police officers more than trebled			0
the study found there was ‘ little evidence ’ of improvement in police standards in @entity101 and the @entity27 – and warned that the model police stations were too expensive to ever be replicated across the country			2
however , the study did find some evidence that @entity28 projects were helping reduce crime against women and girls in some countries			2
@entity28 last night defended its strategy of investing in police and security forces			0
a spokesman said there was ‘ no evidence ’ that funding in @entity10 had supported police repression of political dissidents			1
the spokesman said the project had been dropped following a ‘ risk review ’			0
she also defended the fingerprinting project , which she said would aid the detection of crime and reduce the reliance on forced confessions			0
she added : ‘ security and justice are the most challenging sectors we work in and @entity28 focuses on countries with the biggest potential for improvement			0
we have made good process particularly in helping women and girls gain access to justice , but where concerns about human rights and instability become too high , we have no hesitation in shutting programmes down			0
’ but @entity177 said the report showed ministers had ‘ no strategy ’ for dealing with the issues .			0

reports says £ *52m* for @entity10 ’s security services used *incorrectly*
it warns money was instead used to target opponents of the regime
aid also used to train detectives to analyse call data and track mobiles
researchers warned skills could ' suppress political opposition group '
government said there is ' no evidence ' funding has been misused
