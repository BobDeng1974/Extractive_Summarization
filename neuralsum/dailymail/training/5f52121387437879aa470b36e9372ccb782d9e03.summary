’ investigators say the men are part of a ‘ small but increasing and significant ’ number of @entity54 or foreign nationals living in the @entity54 and travelling to join extremist groups with loose associations to @entity129			0
it is thought @entity54 and other @entity131 may have attended terror camps in the @entity134 region to the south of the @entity136			0

' we very much support the @entity148 in that but our position about troops not being in a combat role is completely unchanged with regard to @entity76			1
' more widely , as the foreign secretary was saying in the context of @entity260 , when it comes to military roles our view is very much that they should be regionally - led			2
' asked whether mr @entity117 was content with @entity264 ' response to the siege , the spokesman said : ' we were always very clear that there there were difficult decisions that faced the @entity4 authorities			1
it was a fluid , fast - moving event			0
we were not going to rush into making judgments			0
