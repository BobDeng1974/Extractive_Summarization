a 33 - year - old beautician from @entity1 knows a thing or two about regret after having ' mummy ' tattooed in large letters on her neck to impress her friends			1
mother - of - two @entity8 got the inking as a teenager because the boys and girls she was hanging around with at the time all had tattoos on their necks			1
when @entity8 's mother found out about her plans , she banned her from the tattoo parlour , but the rebellious teen went away anyway ... but chose the word ' @entity4 ' as a sweetener			1
@entity8 , 33 , from @entity1 , had ' mummy ' tattooed on her neck as a teen and now regrets it as she looks like a bad mother almost instantly , she heavily regretted her decision , and now five years on she is desperate to get the permanent design removed			1
she told @entity29 show bodyshockers : ' within hours i regretted it			2
i tried to convince myself that i wanted to keep it but i knew straight away it had to go			0
' i was rebellious as a teenager , i was hanging around with people at the time who had neck tattoos so i thought they were ok			1
' my mum said at the time said i could n't get one so i had the word ' mummy ' etched on so she then she could n't tell me off			1
' @entity8 with her mother , who advised against getting the tattoo since getting the tattoo , @entity8 has had two children , which has only furthered her desire to get the inking removed			1
she said : ' at school , i try to cover it up but i do n't feel like i do n't look like a responsible parent			2
' i have actually avoided going into the school playground before because my hair is up			0
' i feel like i look like my children 's teenage sister who is still trying to rebel in life			0
' despite the enormous embarrassment that having the tattoo causes @entity8 , she has been reluctant to undergo the laser treatment that would help to get rid of it			1
but the sharp pain from the lasers is n't preventing her - it is the fact that she ca n't have continue to use sunbeds while she has treatment			0
she said : ' i know it sounds stupid , but the fact that i ca n't have a sunbed is a big thing to me			0
' i 'm going to be stressed and upset about that because i 'm going out and i have no tan			2
' you ca n't even use fake tan - what am i going to do ? it 's bad			2
' @entity8 getting the tattoo removed after giving her dilemma some serious consideration , @entity8 decides to go through with the treatments and ditch her sunbeds			1
the cameras follow her as she visits a salon for the first of her treatments			0
after the session has finished , she tells the tv producers : ' that 's really painful , it 's like someone is hitting you with a flame that is electrocuting you at the same time			0
' i 'm glad to have started to get rid of it though			0
' obviously i 'd love to go and have a sunbed because i 'm really pale at the moment , but i 'm no going to			0
' @entity96 is on @entity29 wednesdays at 10pm			0
