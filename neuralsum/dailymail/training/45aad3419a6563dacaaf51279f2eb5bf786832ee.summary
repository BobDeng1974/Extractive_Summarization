by @entity0 published : 16:09 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 27 march 2013 there 's an old saying that claims behind every great man is a great woman			1
according to @entity7 ceo @entity6 , the reverse is also true			1
in fact , she says the ' secret ' of her success was marrying a man 20 years older than her			1
@entity14 's husband @entity13 also worked for @entity7 as a scientist and researcher , but she was the real star			2
the engineering hotshot started as a summer intern at @entity7 and rose rapidly through the ranks to become the first @entity21 female ceo			1
behind every great woman ... @entity7 ceo @entity6 , who was named @entity24 ' 14th most powerful woman in the world in 2009 , says she owes her success to her older husband in 2009 , @entity24 called her the 14th most powerful woman in the world , and she 's credited with helping bring the company back from the dead			1
but it seems that @entity14 , who was known for challenging conventional wisdom at work , was n't afraid to do the same in her personal life			0
she saw her husband 's age as an advantage instead of an obstacle because , according to @entity41 , he ' had already gone through this ' growing up ' stuff			0
often , stories about massive age gaps feature pictures of @entity46 or @entity47 holding hands with women young enough to be their daughters			0
but @entity14 is n't the only ambitious women to discover out that an older man 's assets go way beyond the size of his wallet			1
older men are biologically wired to be more nurturing			1
as someone raised by a single mom in a @entity62 housing project , this was undoubtedly an important quality to @entity14			0
her mother ironed shirts and ran a day care center - making only $ 4,400 in her best year - to raise the funds to send her girls to a private catholic school			1
power couple : @entity0 , pictured with her husband @entity70 on their wedding day , agrees that older men are more supportive to an ambitious woman when @entity14 began studying engineering at @entity76 , her goal was to eventually support her mother			1
as her career and travel schedule became more demanding , her husband was able to retire and help raise their children ( @entity14 has a daughter and a stepson )			0
older men are also more emotionally bonded to their partners because testosterone begins to decrease after 40 , while levels of the ' cuddle ' chemical oxytocin stays steady			1
this is why the ruthless ceo who was out the door at 35 wants to spoon after sex once he hits 50			2
it 's also why first families get so annoyed when the man who was @entity96 becomes a doting husband and father the second time around			2
i 'm not in the same league as @entity14 when it comes to my career , but i did marry a man 20 years older than me			1
as a writer who climbed the ranks from intern to newspaper columnist and later author , having a supportive partner has been crucial to my continued success			2
it was n't always this way : in the past , my love life and career success seemed to be inversely proportional			2
i was attracted to successful , charismatic , ambitious men whom i considered my peers and went through dozens of ' mr. bigs '			2
but the ones i would consider setting up home with often did n't consider me wife material			0
the men i dated either became competitive professionally or expected me to have a more traditional , stay - at - home @entity122 ex , a banker , offered to pay me the yearly equivalent of my biggest - ever salary if i relocated with him to @entity125 to be there for him when he got home from work			1
' do n't worry darling , ' he said , ' you can still do your writing as a hobby			0
' sadly , the assumption that my career should take a backseat to theirs was n't uncommon			0
' i was rooting for her			0
there 's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back ' @entity13 , husband of @entity6 everything changed when i met @entity70 , a handsome and successful music manager 20 years older than me			1
at first , the age difference seemed like the least obvious red flag			0
he had never been married , had a reputation for partying like the rock stars he managed , and brought several scantily - clad twenty - somethings to our first dinner date			1
but after being hyper - focused on work and his next conquest throughout his thirties and forties , he was now ready to ditch the entourage and focus all of his attention on me			2
his age was a plus because , like @entity14 's husband , he was ready to grow up			0
so i married him , and now i have the best of both worlds : a man who is successful enough to understand my ambition , while at the same time happy to let me have the spotlight			1
super women : both @entity172 ceo @entity171 ( left ) and @entity174 coo @entity173 ( right ) have openly spoken of how their husbands ' support has been crucial to their careers other high - profile females have spoken out about the importance of choosing the right partner			1
@entity174 coo @entity173 has openly praised her husband 's willingness to split childcare and housework			0
and for some power couples like @entity172 ceo @entity171 , whose neurosurgeon husband @entity189 moved from @entity190 to @entity191 when she became ceo of @entity192 , the secret seems to be prioritizing and compromise			2
so for ambitious women , it seems that the most important factor is n't a partner 's age			0
' i was rooting for her , ' @entity13 told @entity201 when asked how he felt about his wife 's career eclipsing his own			0
' there 's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back			0
' most successful people have learned the importance of picking the right person on the job			0
but since relationships can build us up or tear us down every day , the most important member of the team is the one waiting for us at home .			0
