by @entity0 published : 20:25 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 20:26 est , 25 january 2014 a spokeswoman for a @entity4 hospital says it wo n't say on saturday whether it plans to appeal a judge 's order to take a pregnant brain - dead woman off of life support			1
@entity11 says @entity12 wo n't announce a decision saturday but she did n't say when it might			2
a judge gave the @entity17 hospital until monday at 5 p.m. to comply with his ruling to remove @entity19 from life support , which her husband @entity21 says she would have wanted			1
this is a photo of @entity21 with her first baby			2
she was pregnant with her second when she collapsed she was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious nov. 26 , possibly due to a blood clot			0
the hospital says it has a legal duty to protect the fetus and is considering an appeal			2
@entity12 spokeswoman @entity11 said ' discussions are ongoing ' as administrators weigh the order issued a day earlier by judge @entity36 the hospital is owned by @entity38 and is being represented in the contentious case by the @entity41 's office			1
the judge 's ruling could give @entity21 a long - awaited chance to bury his wife and move forward to care for their son and his relatives			1
it would also mean the fetus would never be born			0
both the hospital and the family agree that @entity19 meets the criteria to be considered brain - dead - which means she is dead both medically and under @entity4 law - and that the fetus could not be born alive this early in pregnancy			1
but while the hospital says it 's obligated to protect the fetus , @entity21 contends his wife would not have wanted to be kept in this condition			1
and his attorneys have said medical records show the fetus is ' distinctly abnormal			0
' the case has raised questions about end - of - life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus			1
it also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate , with anti-abortion groups arguing @entity21 's fetus deserves a chance to be born			1
several anti-abortion advocates attended friday 's hearing			0
@entity79 says his wife would n't have wanted to keep living in her condition hospital officials have said they were bound by the @entity82 , which prohibits withdrawal of life - sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient			1
but in his brief ruling , @entity36 said that ' mrs. @entity19 is dead , ' meaning that the hospital was misapplying the law			1
the ruling did not mention the fetus			0
the hospital has not pronounced her dead and has continued to treat her over the objections of both @entity21 and her parents , who sat together in court friday			2
@entity97 , a state 's attorney representing the public hospital , told the judge friday that the hospital recognized the @entity21 family 's pain and rights , but said it had a greater legal responsibility to protect the fetus			1
' there is a life involved , and the life is the unborn child , ' @entity97 said			0
as @entity36 gave his ruling , @entity21 embraced his wife 's parents and one of his attorneys			2
@entity21 declined to comment as he left court friday			0
but he told @entity0 earlier this month , in a phone interview sitting in the hospital room , that he and his wife were both paramedics who knew they did n't want to stay on life support this way			1
the couple is pictured here with their first son @entity123			0
the fetus @entity21 is currently carrying has been deemed ' abnormal ' @entity21 described in a signed affidavit filed thursday what it was like to see her now : her glassy , ' soulless ' eyes ; and the smell of her perfume replaced by what he knows to be the smell of death			2
he said he 's tried to hold her hand but ca n't			0
' her limbs have become so stiff and rigid due to her deteriorating condition that now , when i move her hands , her bones crack , and her legs are nothing more than dead weight , ' @entity21 said			2
@entity147 and @entity148 , @entity21 's attorneys , accused the hospital of conducting a ' science experiment ' and warned of the dangerous precedent her case could set , raising the specter of special icus for brain - dead women carrying babies			1
' there is an infant , and a dead person serving as a dysfunctional incubator , ' @entity148 told the judge			0
@entity148 and @entity147 did not say what they would do next , pending a potential appeal by the hospital , and they did n't respond to phone messages left for them saturday			2
@entity21 filed suit against @entity12 in @entity17 , @entity4 to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive the hospital said in a statement that it ' appreciates the potential impact of the consequences of the order on all parties involved " and was deciding whether to appeal			1
the hospital argued in a court filing thursday that there was little evidence of what state lawmakers and courts thought of this issue , but recent laws passed by the @entity189 - controlled @entity188 to restrict abortion made it clear that they wanted to preserve a fetus ' rights			2
the @entity82 ' must convey legislative intent to protect the unborn child , ' the hospital said in its filing			0
' otherwise the @entity188 would have simply allowed a pregnant patient to decide to let her life , and the life of her unborn child , end			0
' not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy			0
@entity208 doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years , according to an article published in the journal @entity212 in 2010			0

the hospital and the family agree that @entity19 meets the criteria to be considered brain - dead - which means she is dead both medically and under @entity4 law - and that the fetus could not be born alive this early in pregnancy
a judge gave the @entity17 hospital until monday at 5 p.m. to comply with his ruling to remove @entity19 from life support , which her husband @entity21 says she would have wanted
