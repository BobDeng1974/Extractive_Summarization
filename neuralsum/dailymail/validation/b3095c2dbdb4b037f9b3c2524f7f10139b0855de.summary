it was supposed to be all about @entity1 — the biggest name in jump racing on his final day riding at the @entity5			1
but instead , @entity6 day 2015 shone a spotlight on a jockey in @entity9 who has ridden fewer winners in his career than the 19 - time champion rides in three months			1
@entity13 , 40 - year - old @entity1 ’s final @entity6 mount , finished a fading ninth behind @entity15 , the novice chaser representing 10 - horse trainer @entity17 and his assistant , wife @entity19			1
@entity1 's wife @entity20 ( left ) passionately willed him on to claim his third @entity6 victory but her relentless optimism soon turned to sheer sadness as her husband crossed the finish like in ninth place jockey @entity1 could not crown his final @entity5 with a @entity6 win @entity1 did get a @entity6 round of applause but it came as he walked around the paddock before the race			1
looking down at his friend and colleague @entity32 , who had yet to be united with his @entity6 ride @entity35 , @entity1 quipped : ‘ they think i ’ve won			1
’ no , @entity38 , they were just hoping			0
ultimately , @entity1 did get on the winner ’s podium but that was to present the trophy to the team behind @entity44 , winner of the concluding @entity46			1
not surprisingly , the @entity47 - trained @entity44 , ridden by @entity47 ’s brother @entity48 , had received a quieter reception than @entity1 ’s fourth - placed @entity50			1
a crowd close to 70,000 had cheered and chanted his name as @entity1 brought his mount down the famous walkway off the track			1
there were not many who had sneaked away to beat the traffic			0
and while they did not get the result they wanted , @entity1 did at least break the habit of a lifetime for them			1
the man for whom winning is the only thing that matters , punched and waved the air			0
the defeat of @entity13 , however , came as no surprise			2
after the @entity6 , @entity1 conceded he had anticipated his fate on arriving at the track when overnight rain was turning the ground soft			1
@entity1 and @entity50 gave it a good go on the 19 - time champion jockey 's final @entity5 ride an emotional @entity1 after his last ever ride at the @entity5 the big screen at @entity5 displayed a tribute to the retiring jockey ‘ i knew when i got here this morning that it was always going to be against him , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ he is a horse who likes good ground and it was always going to be too much of a drag			0
‘ for a horse who is slow he has a little bit of a kick at the end but not when the ground is like that			0
’ @entity1 then paid generous tribute to the winning team			1
‘ the @entity94 have done a wonderful job , ’ he said			0
‘ they have proved that if they get the horse , they can do the job			0
to win the @entity6 with a novice is a fantastic performance			2
’ for the uninitiated , a novice is a horse that had not won in a particular category — hurdles or steeplechase — before the start of the season			0
even if it does then win a race , the horse remains a novice until the end of that season			0
animals who record their first win in march or april may still contest novice events until october 31			0
as for @entity1 , it was just one of those days as he failed to add to thursday ’s @entity121 victory on @entity122 , who goes down as his 31st and final @entity5 victory			1
@entity125 , rated one of his best chances of the week but another wrong - footed by the rain , swung for home with a chance in the @entity131 but finished third behind @entity132 stablemates @entity134 and @entity133			2
@entity1 was presented with a photo album of his @entity5 career after his final fling at the @entity5 @entity1 , in the middle of the picture , walks out of the @entity5 weighing room for the last time strongly - backed @entity141 was staying on when badly hampered and slipped back to 13th in the @entity145 while @entity143 , @entity1 ’s mount in the @entity144 ’ @entity142 , was a non-runner			1
and just when @entity1 wanted the racing gods to smile on him , they frowned instead as @entity50 was hindered by a faller four out			2
@entity1 said : ‘ all through the week people have been amazing and i appreciate it			2
i have always tried to look forward but now i am going to have to look backwards as i have nothing to look forward to			0
’ five rides at @entity155 this afternoon , including the favourite in the @entity157 , will be on his mind this morning but his admiration for @entity160 and his team was well deserved			2
the 7 - 1 shot was in front at the first fence and never headed in a display of controlled jumping at speed that no rival could live with			0
five of the 16 starters were pulled up , including 2013 winner @entity171 and last year ’s victor @entity173 , who started at the back and never looked like defending his title			0
last year ’s runner - up on his own was @entity179 ’s closest pursuer for most of the race but faded to fourth			0
one by one they cracked as @entity160 saw off @entity35 and @entity182 with the equine equivalent of a @entity1 - type performance .			2

@entity1 's final @entity6 mount , @entity13 , finished ninth
@entity188 finished fourth in concluding @entity46
@entity1 presented trophy to the team behind winner @entity44
