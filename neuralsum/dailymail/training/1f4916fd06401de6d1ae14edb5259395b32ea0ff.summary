@entity0 has toppled @entity1 to become the biggest economy in the world , according to figures from the @entity5			1
the @entity6 seemed caught flat - footed by the news , crowing on wednesday about @entity1 's relative economic strength in comparison with the rest of the world			1
the @entity1 has been the global leader since it overtook @entity13 in 1872 , but has now lost its status as top dog			1
that would be 20 per cent bigger than the @entity1 economy , which is forecast to be worth $ 22.3 trillion by then			1
@entity6 press secretary @entity39 seemed oblivious to the news as it percolated on wednesday			1
asked for his assessment of the health of the global economy in the face of @entity47 's zero - sum economy and other troubles in @entity49 – including @entity51 's search for stimulus measures to head off a recession – @entity39 crowed			2
those conditions , he said , ' make the president 's policies look pretty good			0
they certainly make the performance of the @entity1 economy look pretty good			1
' ' the @entity1 is showing the kind of resilience that other counties are desperate for , ' @entity39 claimed			0
' and a lot of that is due in no small part to the policies that this administration put in place			0
' ' there is no doubt that the economic policies that this president put in place are the envy of the world , ' he boasted			1
@entity39 added that the @entity6 is ' hoping that the economy of our allies and partners around the globe strengthens			0
we certainly would like to see that happen			0
' he cited ' a tremendous record of progress that we have made here in the @entity1 ... occurring against the backdrop of a global economy that continues to struggle			2
' that , @entity39 told reporters , ' is an indication of how strong the @entity1 economy is			0
' president @entity23 himself showed his confidence in a @entity1 - centered manufacturing economy on october 3 during a speech in @entity95 , @entity27			2
' about 10 , 15 years ago , everybody said @entity1 manufacturing is going downhill , everything is moving to @entity0 or other countries , ' @entity23 said			2
' and the @entity100 got hit a lot harder than a lot of places because we were the backbone of @entity1 manufacturing			0
' ' but because folks invested in new plants and new technologies , and there were hubs that were created between businesses and universities and community colleges so that workers could master and get trained in some of these new technologies , what we 've now seen is manufacturing driving economic growth in a way we have n't seen in about 20 - 25 years			0
' flat - footed : @entity6 press secretary @entity39 claimed on wednesday that ' there is no doubt that the economic policies that this president put in place are the envy of the world ' silver lining : without adjustments for living costs , the @entity0 economy is still smaller than that of the @entity1 the latest @entity5 figures show the @entity0 economy is worth $ 17.61 trillion , compared with $ 17.4 trillion for the @entity1 spokespersons for several @entity1 senators who serve on the @entity135 did not respond to requests for comment			1
two @entity139 aides said on background that they would n't be offering a critique			0
the new @entity5 analysis is based on a statistic called ' purchasing power parity ' ( @entity145 ) , which makes adjustments for the fact that goods are cheaper in @entity0 and other countries relative to the @entity1			1
without these cost adjustments factored in , the @entity0 economy is still smaller than that of the @entity1 , at $ 10.3 trillion			1
but experts have described the toppling of @entity1 after nearly 150 years by @entity0 , even on the @entity145 measure , as a ' symbolic ' moment for the global economy			1
@entity0 enjoyed three decades of double - digit growth before the global downturn , as industrialization and sweeping economic reforms created a new powerhouse in the @entity162			2
growth has slowed in recent years but remains strong by @entity165 standards with the @entity5 forecasting expansion of 7.4 per cent this year and 7.1 per cent in 2015			0
by contrast , the @entity5 is predicting growth of just 2.2 per cent in the @entity1 this year and 3.1 per cent next year			2
financial powerhouse : in the last decade alone , the skyline of major cities in @entity0 , such as @entity172 ( pictured ) , have been completely transformed as the economy grew in leaps and bounds @entity13 led the world in the industrial revolution of the mid- 18th century , but @entity1 was hot on its heels			1
the @entity1 underwent huge industrial expansion after its civil war ended in 1865 , fueled by rapid urbanization and huge population growth – including the immigration of nearly 30 million @entity49			0
in 1872 , its economy overtook @entity13 to become the world 's largest , a position it held for the next 142 years			1
productivity , leading brands and innovation , coupled with the success of the @entity1 dollar and the fact that 62 per cent of the world 's financial reserves are held in the currency , kept @entity1 on top			2
meanwhile , the economies of @entity13 and other @entity49 powers were ravaged by two world wars			0
@entity13 borrowed heavily from @entity1 during the @entity200 and received a further $ 4.3 billion in 1945			1
@entity0 was the world 's leading trading nation up to the 18th century , until control of its ports and trade were taken over by imperial nations in @entity49			2
under @entity206 it remained inward - looking , until 1980 when the government started to allow foreign investment			0
the @entity5 said tuesday that the @entity1 and the @entity13 ' are approaching economic lift - off ' as they bounce back from the recession			1
but @entity212 , chief economist at the @entity5 , warned that ' potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s ' for much of the @entity214 , including the @entity1 and the @entity13			1
he added that @entity0 is ' maintaining high growth ' which will slow in the coming years to a more ' healthy ' level between 6 per cent and 7 per cent			0
@entity217 , senior fellow at the @entity219 - based @entity218 and an expert on @entity0 , recently highlighted the ' symbolic ' importance of @entity0 overtaking the @entity1			2
' @entity0 is very big and getting bigger , ' he said			0
' it 's not to be underestimated			0
' the news that @entity0 is now the largest economy in the world is an embarrassment for @entity23 and ends @entity1 's 142 years at the top			1
@entity13 had out - produced the @entity1 and its @entity49 rivals for much of the 19th century , at the height of the industrial revolution and with trade links across the @entity232			2
but the @entity1 caught up as a growing population , the expansion of the railways and a focus on industry as well as agriculture boosted its economy			0
@entity0 's wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialisation			1
@entity242 , a car factory in @entity244 @entity0 has a population of around 1.3 billion – four times that of the @entity1 – but its economy has only just become the biggest the @entity145 measure of output makes @entity250 the third largest economy , followed by @entity251 in fourth place and @entity51 in fifth			1
@entity47 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 and the @entity13 make up the rest of the top 10 in that order			0
many economists believe the @entity145 measure of an economy is the fairest measure because it takes into account the cost of living in different countries			0
for example , although wages are typically far lower in less developed countries than in mature economies , goods and services are often also cheaper , which affects individual consumers ' comparative purchasing power			0
but critics argue that analysis does not take into account how well off people actually are			0
@entity0 has a population of around 1.3 billion – four times that of the @entity1 – but its economy has only now become the biggest			1
that means @entity1 are typically far wealthier than their @entity0 counterparts , and better off than people in other emerging markets that benefit from huge work forces and more rapid growth .			2

figures show the @entity0 economy is worth $ 17.6 trillion , compared to @entity1 's $ 17.4 trillion
the @entity5 estimates @entity0 's economy will be worth a *whopping* $ 27 trillion in 2019
the @entity1 has been the global economic performance leader since it overtook @entity13 in 1872
@entity6 seemed oblivious on wednesday , crowing that ' the economic policies that this president put in place are the envy of the world '
