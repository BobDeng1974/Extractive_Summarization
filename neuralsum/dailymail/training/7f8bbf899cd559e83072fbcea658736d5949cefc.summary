by @entity0 last updated at 3:33 pm on 10th december 2011 huge : this serrated @entity2 tooth was found with other @entity4 bones by the researchers the enormous bones of what is believed to be the biggest dinosaur in the @entity9 have been unveiled by university researchers			1
a research paper produced jointly by the @entity12 in @entity13 and the @entity14 describes two gigantic vertebrae and a femur that the team collected in @entity18 from 2003 to 2006			1
the bones belong to the sauropod dinosaur @entity4 : a long - necked plant eater related to @entity22			1
the @entity4 roamed what is now the southwestern region of the @entity9 and @entity18 about 69 million years ago			1
in the paper , @entity13 researcher , @entity25 and @entity26 from @entity27 , @entity28 write how carrying the the vertebrae alone was a ' killer ' task taking up an entire day because the paleontologists carried them 1.2 miles through 100 - degree heat			2
life - size : @entity37 , left , and @entity38 , right pose with a complete reconstruction of the neck vertebra of an @entity4 at @entity13 dr @entity25 said : ' @entity4 has been known for some time , its remains were first described in 1922 from the @entity45 beds of @entity18			1
' since then , more bones have been discovered in @entity18 , @entity47 , some really nice material from @entity49 , and @entity50 , including a few partial skeletons			1
' he said the sheer size of the new bones had caught the researchers by surprise			0
he said researchers had believed that a fully grown @entity4 measured around 60 feet long and weighed about 30 tons			1
but a 2009 study by another @entity13 researcher , dr. @entity59 , led to discovery of a femur thought to belong to an adult that was still growing			2
' this told us that @entity4 got even bigger , but we did n't imagine that it could get quite this big			2
' the enormity of the new bones puts @entity4 in the same size league as other giant sauropods from @entity71 , including @entity72 which weighed about 70 tons , and is widely considered to be the biggest dinosaur of all			1
dr @entity25 added : ' over the past 20 years , @entity76 and @entity77 paleontologists have been unearthing bigger and bigger dinosaurs , putting the rest of the world in the shade			0
comparison : it is difficult for researchers to estimate body size from only fragmentary remains , but overlapping skeletal material gives an indication of maximum sizes for the biggest dinosaurs ' however , our new finds not only show that @entity4 is newly recognized as the biggest dinosaur from @entity93 , but also that it was right up there with the biggest @entity71 species : the @entity9 is back in the fight for the @entity98 spot			2
' although comparison of the new @entity4 bones with the @entity71 species gave the researchers an idea of size , giant specimens of sauropods like @entity4 and @entity72 are only known from very fragmentary remains			1
this means they only offer a glimpse of what a complete @entity4 might look like			0
' we 'd love to find more complete material ' , said dr @entity25			0
' fortunately , @entity4 bones are quite common in the @entity115 of @entity18 , so we have a good chance of going back and finding more , but in order to dig up one of the world 's biggest dinosaurs you need one of the world 's biggest dinosaur digging teams and large digging equipment			1
' the @entity14 field crew is made up of just two to three people , so there are limits on how many bones can be collected in one season			0
vast : paleontologists @entity134 , left , and @entity136 work in badland exposures of the @entity45 beds at @entity139 in the @entity140 of @entity18 even so , many new and important specimens have been recovered over the past 10 to 15 years , including new species , and other members of the fauna including the iconic carnivore @entity2			0
' we found a shed @entity2 tooth with another @entity4 neck bone that we were excavating , ' dr @entity25 said			2
' the @entity2 may have lost its tooth while feeding on an @entity4 carcass			0
' he added that other recent discoveries by paleontologist @entity155 's paleo lab at the @entity156 have emphasised the importance of understanding growth and ontogeny in interpreting dinosaur evolution			0
' increasingly , we 're finding that very large or small individuals often look very different , and are often described as different species			0
' our findings show that @entity4 was originally described based on immature material , and this is a problem as characteristics that define a species are typically only fully gained at adult size			0
' this means that we might be misinterpreting the relationships of @entity4 and possibly other sauropod dinosaurs too			0
