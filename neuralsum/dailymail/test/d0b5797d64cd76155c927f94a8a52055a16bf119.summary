patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million gp appointments last year , shocking new figures have revealed			1
a study reported in the @entity4 found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14			1
the 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week			1
the shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of @entity12 visits , the researchers say			1
lack of access : patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million gp appointments last year the figures , from the @entity16 , also show that patients who report worse access to conventional gp appointments are more likely to use out - of - hours services			1
and surgeries where patients were able to see a gp within two week days had lower rates of @entity12 department visits			1
other research has suggested that greater access to @entity23 surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke			0
the figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to @entity12 are unnecessary			1
a fifth of patients turning up in @entity12 have self - treatable conditions including sore throats , athlete ’s foot and head lice , a study has claimed			1
researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the @entity47 £ 290 million			1
doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair			2
the analysis of data from 15 @entity12 units by consultancy firm @entity55 found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘ self - treatable condition ’			1
the data covered one in ten @entity12 units across @entity60 , so if the trends are mirrored across the country , then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments			1
the problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a gp , particularly out of hours			2
many go to @entity12 in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day , even if they have to wait four hours			2
today 's piece , written by academics from @entity73 and @entity74 , points out that more gps are required if access is to be improved			0
but they add politicians ' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 gps are likely to be challenging to achieve			0
effect : the situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of @entity12 visits , the researchers say			1
the new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self - treatable conditions including sore throats , athlete ’s foot and head lice so despite election pledges by the @entity95 and @entity96 to improve access to @entity80 appointments , they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term			2
the ' public should [ therefore ] question the promises of politicians ' , they said			0
the @entity4 report said largest increase in @entity80 over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 @entity80 ( from 2004/05 to 2008/09 ) under @entity96			0
but @entity96 's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was ' far from being achieved ' , it adds			2
only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a gp within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government			2
the researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer @entity12 attendances			1
@entity120 has promised patients will be able to access gp surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the @entity95 are re-elected			2
@entity123 has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if @entity96 are voted in			2
but the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic , adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined			0
denial : the study authors say that despite election pledges by the @entity95 and @entity96 ( @entity120 and @entity123 are pictured , left to right ) to improve access to @entity80 appointments , these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term ' the aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the @entity143 and @entity96 parties do not seem explicit , ' the analysis said			0
' one aim is undoubtedly to win election votes			0
but the aims for the @entity47 and for patients are less clear			0
' the analysis suggests five points of action ' for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued '			0
these are : * evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the @entity95 * making general practice consultation data routinely available * looking at employing practice staff besides @entity80 * evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations * considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist - led minor illness services			1
lead author @entity166 , of @entity73 , said : ' both parties have made bold promises about access to @entity23 services , but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking			0
' it 's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely			0
' the pledges on increases to the gp workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term			0
' instead , he recommended the @entity47 evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase gp capacity , such as consultations and triage by phone or online			0
' it should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of @entity80			0

study : 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14
10 per cent who could *n't* amounts to 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts
situation is responsible for a quarter of @entity12 visits , say researchers
problem is more to do with lack of doctors rather than opening hours
