but thanks to the donation of the £ 3,000 bed , @entity7 's condition is better than ever			1
in just one month of sleeping in the bed , his lung capacity has already increased by eight per cent			1
it works by vibrating at different levels on different areas of @entity58 to loosen the sticky fluid and cause him to cough it up , in turn saving his life			0
mrs @entity64 , 38 , said : ' @entity7 has never coughed up any mucus in the whole of his life			1
' but since he has had the bed , he 's started clearing it from his chest			0

' the bed uses @entity108 as a form of massage therapy to help people with breathing problems			2
it uses a 3 - way vibration that rotates and gently pulsates out from the centre in a whirlpool motion			0
manufacturers say for respiratory problems such as @entity9 , these gentle vibrations help to mobilise any mucus , giving @entity9 sufferers a better chance of expelling it from the lungs and helping with chest clearance			1
@entity7 has created a number of videos where he talks about his treatment and how he is feeling , to help other children in his position			2
as a keen fundraiser , he has already stumped up £ 4,000 with the help of his family to support the @entity83			0
his mother said : ' it 's so refreshing to see someone so young who is so poorly , wanting to help others			0
