by @entity0 with the door to the steam room shut at his @entity5 home , @entity1 liked to retreat from the stresses of being a sworn enemy of @entity8 , the former @entity9 man he bankrolled to become @entity11 ’s president			1
but it was in this sanctuary that his body was found on saturday , a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death			1
once such good friends that @entity1 spent millions creating a political party for @entity8 , the pair fell out spectacularly in 2000 , prompting the @entity26 leader ’s supposed ‘ godfather ’ to flee to @entity23			2
unanswered questions : @entity1 's body was found at his estate in @entity5 on saturday , a discovery that has started a firestorm of suspicion about the manner of his death suggestions that @entity1 , pictured with his former girlfriend @entity33 and their dog , @entity36 , had committed suicide were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire 's friends and business associates yet even after escaping @entity42 and moving into the former home of tv star @entity44 , replete with hi - tech security systems as well as underground car parking , sauna and swimming pool , @entity1 did not feel safe			1
surrounded by teams of @entity26 security men , and with a personal bodyguard alongside him 24 hours a day , he was convinced his @entity53 enemies would track him down and kill him , even after he moved two years ago to a new property in @entity55			1
yesterday , suggestions that @entity1 had committed suicide – as reported widely by the @entity26 media – were being treated with scepticism by the billionaire ’s friends and business associates			2
‘ @entity1 was a fighter , and suicide was just not in his dna , ’ said dr @entity62 , a close friend			2
' @entity1 was looking to the future and did not seem to be suicidal			2
we spoke about his daughter			2
‘ @entity1 feared for his safety , and understood that the @entity53 aimed to destroy him as an example for anyone else who opposed them			1
he understood the @entity53 mindset better than anyone			1
’ @entity74 , a @entity1 supporter given political asylum by @entity23 for his opposition to @entity8 , was emphatic			2
‘ such a person could never commit suicide , ’ he said			2
‘ he was an exceptionally lively person and , despite his various setbacks in life , always remained so			2
’ the discovery of @entity1 's body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire , @entity84 ( pictured ) , who he joined forces with to put @entity8 into power @entity91 , another @entity26 emigre and friend of the dead billionaire , also dismissed speculation that @entity1 had killed himself : ‘ no , it ’s wrong			2
there are no exterior signs of suicide , no traces of a syringe , no signs that he could have taken some pills			2
’ even more disturbing , the discovery of @entity1 ’s body comes five years after the unexplained death of another billionaire he joined forces with to put @entity8 into power – and who also later fell out spectacularly with the @entity26 leader			2
@entity84 , a businessman and politician , was found dead at the @entity106 mansion he owned , not far from @entity1 ’s former home , in 2008			1
police , who initially described the death as ‘ suspicious ’ , tested for radiation poisoning , but no traces were found			2
along with @entity1 , the dead man had helped bankroll @entity8 ’s rise to the @entity53 , but had later clashed with associates of the country ’s president as rival sides battled for control of @entity11 ’s assets			1
no doubt : @entity1 was hated in the @entity53 shortly before his death , the 52 - year - old had spoken of an assassination plot , claiming that a hit squad of four @entity126 had been sent by the @entity53 to @entity127 ‘ to do something against me ’ , while secret tapes of a conversation between a @entity26 official and a @entity132 hitman emerged in which they discussed how to make him ‘ disappear completely ’			1
experts say that , as well as deadly substances such as ricin and polonium , a favoured method for despatching enemies of @entity11 is poisoning with sodium fluoroacetate , a chemical used in pesticides that causes heart failure when ingested in tiny amounts , with the cause of death notoriously difficult to establish			1
if @entity84 was assassinated , could the long arm of the @entity26 leadership have reached out to an enemy in the @entity151 again ? there is no doubt @entity1 was hated in the @entity53			1
yet it would be a grim end indeed for a man who was once a model @entity157 citizen			2
born in @entity42 in 1946 to a @entity159 civil engineer father and housewife mother , he was studious at school and sufficiently gifted at mathematics to join the @entity157 ’s @entity163			0
but the collapse of communism helped propel him from academia to the pinnacle of one of the most ruthless and violent business environments on @entity11			0
as the @entity157 empire crumbled and gang wars erupted , @entity1 decided to go into business and forged a relationship with @entity174 , producer of the @entity177 car			1
to protect his fortune , @entity1 forged ties with @entity132 gangsters – some of the most feared people in @entity11			1
the graveyards of @entity11 are full of dead businessmen from the 1990s , and @entity1 almost joined them : he faced a gun battle in central @entity42 in 1994 , and a year later the @entity185 he was in was blown up , decapitating his driver			1
but with nerves of steel , @entity1 went for broke : he paid for the publication of president @entity191 ’s memoirs , securing him the goodwill of @entity11 ’s then leader			0
the political clout this gave him offered access to the national airline @entity198 , and then to @entity11 ’s massive oil reserves			0
rewarded with a seat on @entity191 ’s @entity201 , he helped implement the peace deal that ended @entity11 ’s first war with rebels in the @entity132 region , and was seen as a figure of almost @entity208 - like influence			1
to protect his fortune , @entity1 forged ties with @entity132 gangsters - some of the most feared people in @entity11 ( police pictured at a road block near to where it is believed @entity1 died in @entity5 ) as @entity191 ’s health deteriorated in 1999 and his popularity plummeted , @entity1 and others began to look for a protege who could rule @entity11 for its second post-soviet decade			1
the obscure former @entity9 spy they found was @entity8 , who was officially approved by the powerbrokers of @entity11 during talks at their dachas around @entity42			0
‘ he presented [ @entity8 ] to the @entity26 establishment of that time , brought him into @entity191 ’s close circle , and he was the first to believe that out of this indistinct bureaucrat , a successor could be made , ’ said commentator @entity222			0
‘ he was certainly the political father of @entity8			0
’ yet , after he came to power backed by @entity1 ’s cash , @entity8 became irritated with the demands of his sponsor , who once said : ‘ everything can be bought and everything on @entity11 has a price			0
politicians are the hired help of entrepreneurs			0
’ last year @entity1 suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with @entity241 owner @entity240 ( pictured ) this was an affront to @entity8 , a proud , self - proclaimed strongman who did not like anyone having power over him			1
his response was characteristically uncompromising , and after a series of death threats @entity1 fled			0
since @entity23 rebuffed @entity8 ’s calls for @entity1 to be extradited , the @entity53 has been busy preparing case after case against him in absentia – with ‘ crimes ’ allegedly ranging from massive fraud to murder			1
undeterred , @entity1 used his @entity23 base to vow to overthrow @entity8			0
he joined forces with other exiles to implicate the @entity26 state in killings			0
but last year he suffered a devastating financial setback when he lost a legal battle with @entity241 owner @entity240			1
@entity1 wanted £ 4billion from @entity240 , whom he accused of using the threat of @entity53 retribution to intimidate him into selling shares at a knockdown price			1
some say @entity1 had struggled to come to come to terms with losing the case , in which legal costs hit £ 100million			0
clearly shaken by the verdict in august , @entity1 said it appeared to have been written by @entity8 himself			0
‘ life is life , ’ he sighed , before being driven off in a black @entity185 with tinted windows			0
those who believe he died either of natural causes or at his own hand point to his dramatic loss of capital in recent times			0
his fortune , once estimated at £ 2billion , was running out , partly because he had spent years fighting a losing battle against @entity53 attempts to seize his assets			1
he was forced to sell his £ 200million yacht , and closed his political foundation , which had waged a public relations war against @entity8 , highlighting corruption and political killings linked to the @entity9			0
he was also reeling from one of @entity23 ’s biggest - ever divorce settlements , to his former wife @entity292 in 2011 , to whom he paid more than £ 60million			0
known for his love of cognac and beautiful women , @entity1 was married three times and was a notorious womaniser			0
but lately one friend claimed he had been depressed by the loss of his wealth and was not himself			0
‘ we will learn later what exactly happened , but in recent months @entity1 was depressed , ’ said @entity302			0
‘ there was no secret about that			0
the court case was a massive blow			0
we were concerned about him			0
’ that concern was not shared by his enemies in the @entity53			1
while an official spokesman claimed yesterday that @entity1 had written to @entity8 this year to apologise , and begged to come home , his friends said this was merely @entity157 - style propaganda			1
indeed , he would have faced years in prison had he returned			0
whatever the truth , one thing is certain : @entity1 will never criticise the @entity53 again , and that is just the way @entity8 will like it .			1
