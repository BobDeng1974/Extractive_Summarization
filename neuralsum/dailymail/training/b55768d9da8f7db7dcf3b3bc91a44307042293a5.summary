@entity0 is to face a court trial for alleged tax evasion after a judge rejected the @entity6 star 's appeal in @entity7			1
the four - time @entity9 winner and his father , @entity10 , are accused of withholding about £ 3.4million in unpaid taxes between 2007 and 2009			2
the @entity7 judge 's statement read : ' in this type of crime , it is not necessary for someone to have complete knowledge of all the accounting and business operations nor the exact quantity , rather it is sufficient to be aware of the designs to commit fraud and consent to them			2
now he must sit in the dock alongside his father and answer questions relating the failure to pay tax in @entity7 between 2007 - 09 on various sponsorship deals , by diverting revenue through companies in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
in july , @entity7 's public prosecutor recommended charges be dismissed against the 27 - year - old , arguing @entity10 was not responsible for his family 's finances , as that was his father 's duty			1
if a court decides that he was party to the wilful avoidance of tax he will face a large fine and could even face a suspended prison sentence			0
@entity10 made a payment of about £ 8m to the @entity7 tax man last year to head off further problems relating to years tax 2010 and 2011 , and paid the £ 10.2m owed on his image rights and the £ 9.4m owed on his salary on time for the last tax year			0
@entity10 trains alongside @entity6 striker @entity74 as the pair look to claim this year 's @entity77 title @entity10 shares a laugh with @entity74 but the @entity6 maestro is being dragged into a court trial @entity10 and his father , @entity10 , have five days to appeal the ruling of the @entity7 judge on friday @entity10 walks alongside new @entity6 signing @entity84 as he trains in @entity7 during the @entity77 season @entity88 content with life in @entity90 but despite having put his fiscal affairs in order he is still being pursued for the alleged fraud in the period 2007 - 09			1
a court in @entity6 , however , decided the @entity96 captain could have been aware and approved the creation of a web of shell companies that were allegedly used to evade taxes due on income from image rights			1
@entity10 and his father , who manages his financial affairs and acts as a representative , have five days to appeal the ruling			0
they both deny the allegations			0
it is reported that @entity10 's income at @entity6 is about £ 12.5m per year , although that does not include any sponsorship endorsements			0
