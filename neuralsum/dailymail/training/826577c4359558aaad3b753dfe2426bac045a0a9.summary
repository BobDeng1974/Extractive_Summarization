by @entity0 last updated at 12:48 am on 25th june 2011 a @entity2 prosecutor today tore into @entity4 ’s brother in court , appearing to suggest that he was putting on a display of emotion and giving inconsistent testimony to help his sister 's defence			1
@entity11 - who since his niece ’s death in 2008 had refused to meet with lawyers on either side of the case to discuss evidence - admitted that he ' reached out ' to the defence earlier this week to offer ' information			0
. , that i thought was important ' , angering state attorneys as they challenged him on conflicts in his testimony			0
the prosecution ’s expressions of cynicism over mr @entity11 ’s reliability came a day after his mother @entity28 also dropped a bombshell when she testified that it was her , not her daughter , who researched chloroform on the family computer in march 2008			1
break down : @entity11 testifies in the murder case of his sister @entity4 , saying he was n't told about his sister 's pregnancy until just before his niece @entity4 was born her revelation , which was at partial odds with a deposition she gave in 2009 , damaged the state ’s assertion that @entity4 , 25 , plotted in advance to overpower her two - year - old daughter @entity4 with chloroform before suffocating her			1
giving evidence at the trial in @entity49 , @entity2 , mr @entity11 broke down as he testified about how his sister ’s pregnancy had been kept secret from him in 2005			2
his evidence was introduced by the defence to bolster their claim that the @entity55 were a dysfunctional family with ' dark secrets ' who hid their daughter ’s pregnancy out of shame and raised her to lie			2
despite it being ' brutally obvious ' that his sister was pregnant in summer 2005 , he claimed that his sister ' waved off ' his enquiries and that his mother also avoided discussing it when he asked			2
as a result , he did not visit his sister in hospital after she gave birth , he said			0
' i was a little hurt , just did n’t want to be there , ' he testified , crying as he spoke			0
his sister also looked distressed , weeping in court			2
during the emotional day in court @entity4 wiped away tears from her eyes while her brother @entity11 testified reaction : @entity78 also teared up while mother @entity4 testify today also during mr @entity11 's testimony , @entity28 began to cry and had to leave the court room with her husband			1
mr @entity11 continued : ' i was very angry at my mom and i was also angry at my sister			0
i was just angry at everyone in general that they did n’t want to include me and did n’t find it important enough to tell me , especially after i had asked			0
' but under cross-examination , he ceded that his court testimony was at odds with a deposition given in 2009			2
in his deposition , he stated that he had never directly challenged his sister about her pregnancy and that far from trying to sweep the pending birth under the carpet , his mother and father had gone ' over the top ' to prepare for their grand - daughter ’s arrival , buying a crib , taking their daughter shopping for baby items , turning their spare room into a nursery with a @entity112 theme , and organizing a baby shower			1
prosecutor @entity114 pointed out that mr @entity11 had not wept when asked the same questions in 2009 about his niece ’s birth			0
' what was different two hours ago in this courtroom that question that caused such raw emotion which was n’t present two years ago when you were asked the same thing ? ' mr @entity114 demanded roughly			0
mr @entity11 replied : ' two years ago , i did not 100 percent hold the belief that @entity4 was dead … during that two - year span i have come to the place that i believe she is			2
' he added later : ' i do n’t want to be here			0
i do n’t want my sister to be here and my parents to be here … this is obviously just very very emotionally draining			0
' swim : an image projected on a courtroom monitor showing @entity4 , left , and her granddaughter @entity4 at the family pool the video of @entity4 showed how she was capable of climbing the ladder and getting into the pool with almost no help from her grandmother , who cried as she watched the video play in court @entity4 has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder , aggravated manslaughter of a child , aggravated child abuse and four counts of lying to law enforcement			1
she potentially faces the death penalty if convicted			0
when @entity4 first went missing in june 2008 , @entity11 told her mother that the child was with a nanny			1
a month later , when her mother called in sheriff ’s deputies , @entity11 claimed that the nanny had kidnapped the child			2
during opening statements in her trial , her story changed again as her lawyer claimed that @entity4 drowned accidentally in the family pool , that her grandfather @entity165 disposed of the body , and that @entity78 went along with the cover - up because she had been molested by her father as a child and ' raised to lie			1
' @entity165 has denied the allegations			0
photographs presented in court by the defence today showed @entity4 climbing up a ladder into her grandparents ’ above - ground swimming pool , supported by her grandmother , illustrating that she was capable of getting in on her own			1
@entity4 testified that @entity4 was able to open a sliding glass door that led to the backyard pool			1
@entity4 cried again as she testified for the second day in a row for the defense in the murder trial of her daughter stress : @entity165 listens as his wife @entity4 testifies ' even at that point , she could even climb into the pool ' @entity28 said when shown a photo			1
@entity4 wiped away tears while a video of her playing with the girl was viewed by the jury during her mother 's testimony			1
mrs @entity194 testified that the ladder would always be removed after they had swum together			0
but on june 16 , 2008 , the day the defence now claims that @entity4 was found dead in the pool , the ladder was mysteriously back in position , she stated , confirming evidence introduced by detectives earlier in the trial			1
the new revelations follow a dramatic day in court yesterday , where @entity4 admitted making internet searches about chloroform on a family computer - directly contradicting prosecutors ' theory that it was @entity78 who made the queries			1
tight : attorneys with the defence , @entity215 , second from right , and @entity216 , right , meet with judge @entity217 , centre , in a sidebar with prosecuting attorneys , left @entity165 and @entity4 stand together in the courtroom during a break in @entity28 's testimony			1
at one they left in tears during a terse courtroom exchange , judge @entity217 poured scorn on @entity11 ’s lawyer , @entity216 , for attempting to quiz @entity4 about ' marital difficulties ' , judge @entity217 cut him short , telling him that her relationship with her husband was irrelevant to the case			2
' if your theory of defence is ever - changing , maybe you just need to tell me what your theory of defence is			0
at least , somebody try to explain it to me , ' the judge told mr @entity216 cynically			0
among the spectators in court today was judge @entity246 , who was originally assigned to the @entity11 case in 2008 but withdrew nearly two years later amid hostilities with mr @entity216			2
judge @entity246 – who during a bond hearing in july 2008 remarked that ' the truth and ms @entity194 are strangers , ' - recused himself in april 2010 after mr @entity216 filed a motion accusing him of being a ' self - aggrandising media hound ' who was biased against his client			0
in a fiery parting statement to the court in 2010 , judge @entity246 accused mr @entity216 of being the one trying to court public attention , noting sarcastically : ' the recusal motion accuses the undersigned of being a ‘ self - aggrandising media hound			0
if convicted of daughter @entity4 's murder , @entity78 could face the death penalty			1

court shown emotional video of grandmother @entity28 helping @entity4 into pool
brother cries saying he did n't know @entity78 was pregnant most of pregnancy
he says stains found in the car were made by him , not @entity4 's body
@entity78 's mother and father leave court in tears
