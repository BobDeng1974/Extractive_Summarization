@entity1 alumnus @entity0 proved older brother knows best when he brought his sister to a @entity5 hockey game last month @entity0 and his sister @entity6 were watching his alma mater play @entity8 on @entity9 when they were hilariously caught on the kiss cam - a common sports tradition where couples are forced to kiss in front of the entire crowd			1
a couple of weeks before the game , @entity0 told @entity6 that they could be put on kiss cam considering the romantic holiday - but @entity6 scoffed at the chances they 'd end up at the jumbo tron			1
he printed out the arrow according to which seats they would be in and then showed her the sign before the game			0
' she thought i was being a dumb older brother and there 's no way we 'd end up on kiss cam , ' he told the @entity5			1
so when the kiss cam started in the third period , @entity0 whipped out the piece of paper and held it in his lap while they stared at the first two couples on the big screen			1
' and then lo and behold , we were the next couple on there , and i lifted up the sign and opened it up and somewhat held a straight face for the first couple seconds and then started laughing , ' he said			0
no way : @entity0 printed the sign off at work and showed it to his sister before the game , but she thought he was just being a ' dumb older brother ' getting ready : as kiss cam started , @entity0 whipped out the piece of paper and held it in his lap as he watched the big screen with his sister family fun : the pair start laughing along with the cheering crowd after the man reveals his note it was a laugh shared not only by those in the crowd but everyone who watched it online as well			1
since the video was posted online , it has garned over 13 million views on @entity77			2
' i thought it would blow over , and it 's gone crazy , ' sister @entity6 told @entity81			2
if ever caught on the kiss cam with @entity0 again , @entity6 said she would hold up a sign that says : ' older brothers are so embarrassing '			1
@entity0 on the other hand , hopes he wo n't find himself next to his sister again			0
' the goal is next year not to bring my sister to the @entity9 game			2
hopefully i get a date out of this , ' he said			0
' kiss cam ' became a tradition in the early 1980s as a way to entertain the crowd during pauses in baseball games			0
it is now a tradition in a majority of major arena sports in the @entity101 and @entity102 , where the camera ' selects ' a couple in the audience who are then shown on the giant screen above the pitch - the @entity108 .			0

@entity1 alumnus @entity0 brought his sister @entity6 to a hockey game on february 14
in the weeks leading up to the game , @entity0 warned @entity6 that they could be put on kiss cam since the game was on @entity9
@entity6 thought they 'd never make it on the @entity108 , but @entity0 printed off a sign anyway that said ' my sister ' just to be safe
when they ended up on the camera , @entity0 opened up the sign and both burst out laughing
the video posted on @entity77 has since garned over *13million* views
