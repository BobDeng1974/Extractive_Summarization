a gang of @entity2 diplomats face jail after they avoided £ 5million in tax by turning their @entity6 embassy into a tobacconist			1
seven staff members ' systematically abused ' diplomatic tax exemptions to order 29 tonnes of rolling tobacco in just three years - more than half a million pouches			1
they were caught after the @entity12 was alerted to the system being abused and told tax inspectors , who found more than 60 enormous order forms			1
tax cheats : deputy head of the @entity19 ( left ) and first secretary @entity20 ( right ) sold millions of tonnes of rolling tobacco from their £ 6m redbrick embassy in west @entity6 they decided the vast amounts could not possibly be for personal use and launched a criminal probe which led the @entity2 government to waive the workers ' diplomatic immunity			1
all seven were at the @entity19 in @entity32 , west @entity6 , and included its deputy head @entity33 , 54 , and first secretary @entity20 , 48			0
they denied conspiracy to cheat the public revenue but were found guilty after a trial at @entity37 lasting more than a month			0
the jury heard they ordered so much tobacco that the firms which supplied them , @entity40 and @entity41 , often could not bring enough			2
driver @entity44 , who gave evidence for the prosecution , said he was hired to deliver boxes crammed full of @entity48 and @entity50 pouches from a warehouse in @entity52 , @entity53			1
once he arrived at the @entity19 , a £ 6million redbrick townhouse in one of @entity6 's most expensive streets , he gave the orders to front desk secretary @entity58 , 48 , who signed for them			0
they would then be put in a ' back room ' , the trial heard - and it was a regular occurrence , since he saw @entity58 so often that she had a pet name for him			0
diplomats in @entity67 are allowed to order alcohol , perfume and tobacco without having to pay vat or excise duty because of their status			1
vast : boxes crammed full of @entity48 and @entity50 were picked up from a warehouse in @entity53 plush : their workplace ( centre left with the @entity2 flag ) was in one of @entity6 's most expensive streets diplomatic immunity has existed for more than 50 years and is agreed on by almost every country in the world , even those with frosty international relations such as @entity88			1
it was signed into law under the @entity91 to ensure diplomats can represent their nation without being harassed by their hosts			0
this is particularly essential in countries which criminalise behaviour which would be perfectly acceptable at home , and those which prosecute people for political reasons			0
but there have been abuses of the system - including the fact that diplomats do not have to pay parking fines			2
more than £ 60million of @entity6 's congestion charge fines have been avoided by embassies , foreign secretary @entity108 revealed last year , including £ 7million by @entity112 diplomats alone			2
it is extremely rare for immunity to be waived , and it can only happen with the agreement of the diplomat 's home country			2
some nations refuse on principle , while most reserve the measure only for serious crimes			0
in 2002 @entity123 waived diplomatic immunity on a @entity6 - based official who was accused of killing a mugger			1
he was later found not guilty of manslaughter and murder			0
they are only permitted to buy the products for personal use by themselves or other colleagues within their embassies			0
but the @entity2 diplomats took advantage of a loophole in which there was a quota on the number of cigarettes they could order , but not the amount of hand rolling tobacco			1
that meant they were allowed to sign off more than 60 diplomatic order forms between 2009 and 2012 before the alarm was raised			1
they broke the law by selling the goods from their @entity32 headquarters - making them once again eligible to pay around £ 4.8million in tax			2
the @entity12 had to ask permission from the @entity2 government for the men to be prosecuted			1
normally diplomats would be exempt from prosecution , but it was decided that the normal privileges would be waived			0
the court heard @entity33 and @entity20 both abused their diplomatic privileges along with welfare officer @entity164 , 29 , and finance attaché @entity165 , 38			2
the other guilty workers - @entity58 , 54 - year - old driver @entity166 and 60 - year - old secretary @entity167 - did not have diplomatic privileges , but aided the tax fraud			2
@entity171 was also convicted of dealing , harbouring , concealing or carrying dutiable goods			0
eighth defendant @entity173 , who worked in the same building for the @entity175 , was found not guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue			0
@entity178 , a fraud specialist for the @entity180 , said : ' the deception undertaken by these defendants involved a serious breach of the trust of their own government and of the @entity67 people			0
lengthy : the trial of the seven tax fraudsters at @entity37 lasted more than a month ' the scheme they designed and implemented not only resulted in the public purse being cheated of almost £ 4.8m in tax revenue , but it also abused their diplomatic status , taking advantage of the entire system of diplomatic privilege which is reliant on trust and responsibility			1
' for all practical purposes , the scheme in operation was like running a business and the volume of tobacco was so large that to suggest it was for personal use , or for the use of the @entity210 , is implausible			0
' ms @entity178 thanked the government of the @entity2 for waiving diplomatic immunity			1
she added : ' the public should have confidence that in cases where our tax systems have been exploited , all steps will be taken to ensure that diplomatic staff can not commit offences and then hide behind diplomatic immunity			1
' the @entity222 is now officially known as the @entity223 after the @entity225 nation left the @entity226 last year			0
the case forced @entity67 authorities to extend their quota system to cover hand rolling tobacco just six months after they discovered the fraud in 2012			1
the seven guilty workers will be sentenced on wednesday .			0
