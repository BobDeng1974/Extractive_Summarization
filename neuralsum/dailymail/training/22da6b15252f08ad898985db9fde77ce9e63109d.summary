by @entity0 an electronic cigarette advert featuring the slogan ' @entity3 ' has been banned for implying they were beneficial to users ' health			2
watchdogs launched an investigation into the @entity10 poster campaign after receiving a complaint it suggested that there was evidence the e-cigarettes were not harmful			1

banned : this @entity10 advert has been banned for implying its e-cigarettes were beneficial to users ' health they added that they had wanted the slogan to be catchy , alliterative and relevant to both the product and the action of inhaling vapour into the lungs			1
however , the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) found the advert to be in breach of its rules regarding misleading advertising and substantiation and banned it from being used again			1
an @entity36 spokesman said : ' within the context of the ad , we considered that consumers , particularly those who were existing smokers , were likely to interpret the claim " @entity49 " as meaning that @entity10 e-cigarettes contained properties that were not harmful to their lungs or that they would experience an improvement in the health of their lungs if they used @entity10 products			1
' ruling : watchdogs also concluded that the advert could suggest that @entity64 products were less harmful to users ' lungs than traditional cigarettes ( pictured ) or other brands of e-cigarettes the spokesman added that the advert could suggest that @entity10 products were less harmful to users ' lungs than traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes			2
he said : ' we also considered that the claim could also be interpreted to mean that consumers should " love their lungs " by switching from traditional cigarettes , or , given the inclusion of the phrase " e-cigarettes have evolved " , from other brands of e-cigarettes to @entity10 products			2
' the wording of the ad suggested a comparison between using @entity10 products and traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes , that implied @entity10 products were less harmful to users ’ lungs			0
' we noted that we had not seen any evidence to demonstrate that @entity10 products were beneficial to the health of users ’ lungs or that the products were less harmful than traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes , as implied in the ad			0
' on this basis , we considered the claim " love your lungs " had not been substantiated and concluded the ad was misleading			0
' he added : ' we told @entity10 to ensure that they did not use the claim " love your lungs " or make any claims that implied their products were not harmful or were beneficial to the health of users ’ lungs in future ads , unless they held robust evidence to substantiate the claims			2
' a @entity10 spokesman said today : ' it was never the intention of @entity10 to make a health claim with the slogan " love your lungs "			1
it was an alliterative tagline that was intended to grab attention , and the obvious connotations associated with lungs and vaping			0
' we apologise if there was any confusion about this message , as that was never our intention			0
' we will continue to sell our products in an aim to help people switch from smoking tobacco			0
