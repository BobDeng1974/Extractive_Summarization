by @entity0 @entity1 on monday said it would buy @entity3 spirits company @entity2 for $ 13.6 billion cash in a deal that would make the @entity9 company the world 's third - largest spirits maker			1
including the assumption of @entity2 's net debt , the deal is valued at $ 16 billion			1
it brings together @entity2 's @entity14 and @entity16 bourbons , @entity18 cognac and @entity19 with @entity1 's @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity24 @entity9 whiskies , @entity25 and @entity26			1
once the acquisition is completed , @entity1 will become the third largest whiskey company and the fifth largest malt whiskey company by volume , according to @entity31			1
@entity32 - based @entity2 will be purchased by @entity9 powerhouse @entity1 for $ 16billion the deal is the latest example of how @entity9 beverage companies are seeking to quench their thirst for overseas growth as the population in their home market shrinks			1
' all @entity9 beverage companies have been focused on getting growth outside @entity9 , ' said @entity42 analyst @entity41			0
the deal boosts @entity1 's market share in the @entity3 to 11 percent from less than 1 percent , according to @entity46 analyst @entity45			1
the proposed acquisition is also @entity9 's third - largest announced outbound deal of all time , according to @entity51 data			1
last year , privately held @entity1 floated its food and non-alcoholic drinks company , @entity52 , to raise money for overseas acquisitions			2
@entity56 bought control of @entity59 's @entity58 for $ 2.6 billion in 2011 , and @entity60 took a stake in @entity63 brewery @entity62 in 2009			0
@entity14 is one of the best - selling and most - recognizable brands of bourbon - a uniquely @entity3 spirit - in the world @entity68 one of the biggest winners in the @entity1 deal will be @entity71			1
the $ 12 billion hedge fund owned by @entity73 owned 12.8 percent , or 20.8 million shares , of @entity2 at the end of the third quarter			0
at that time , @entity2 was @entity71 's third - biggest position , and it has helped boost the hedge fund 's performance in a year overshadowed by a $ 500 million loss on @entity81 and climbing losses on @entity83 @entity71 first invested in @entity84 in october 2010			2
the company then sold its golf business , which included @entity88 golf balls , and spun off its home supply products including faucet maker @entity90 and @entity92			0
the name of the remaining company was then changed to @entity2			0
@entity73 declined to comment on the deal with @entity1			2
@entity96 said on monday that it would pay $ 83.50 per share in cash , a 25 percent premium to @entity2 's closing stock price of $ 66.97 on friday			2
@entity2 shares closed up 24.6 percent at $ 83.42 on monday			0
the purchase price is more than 20 times @entity2 's earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization , a multiple that comes close to the record 20.8 times ebitda that @entity111 paid in 2008 for the maker of @entity114 vodka			0
@entity1 will become the third - largest spirits company in the world after the deal comes through but unlike the @entity114 acquisition , there are few cost - saving opportunities in monday 's deal , @entity41 said , since more than 90 percent of @entity1 's business is in @entity9 , and the @entity2 business will continue to operate in the @entity3			1
if the deal falls through , @entity2 must pay @entity1 a $ 425 million termination fee			1
the deal between @entity1 and @entity2 came together quickly - in less than two months , according to a person close to the transaction			1
analysts believe a counterbid by the likes of larger rivals @entity133 or @entity111 is unlikely , citing the deal 's high multiple , termination fee and approval by both boards			0
@entity1 already distributes @entity2 products in @entity9 , and @entity2 distributes @entity1 's products in @entity141 and other @entity143 markets			2
@entity1 already has a portfolio of @entity9 whiskies and one scotch that are strong in its home market , but the acquisition of @entity2 gives it bourbon , @entity146 , @entity151 and @entity152 whiskies and access to a stronger distribution network not just in the @entity3 but in key emerging markets such as @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity59			1
the combined company will have annual sales of about $ 4.3 billion			0
@entity2 has been viewed as an attractive takeover target since becoming a stand - alone public spirits company in october 2011			2
analysts and bankers long speculated that its range of bourbons would fit nicely into @entity133 's portfolio , which has many scotch whiskies but only one bourbon			2
so - called brown spirits , like whiskey , have experienced a resurgence in recent years , helped by the growing popularity of classic cocktails			0
@entity3 sales volume of bourbon and @entity178 whiskey have grown 13.2 percent in the five years to 2012 , according to the @entity179			0
super-premium brands have grown nearly 80 percent over the same period			0
@entity1 intends to fund the acquisition with cash on hand and fully committed financing from @entity185			1
financial advisers in the deal are @entity188 for @entity1 and @entity189 and @entity190			0
legal advisers are @entity192 for @entity1 and @entity193 for @entity2 .			0
