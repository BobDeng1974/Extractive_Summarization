@entity1 's comments may unsettle @entity14 powers as they seek to isolate @entity11 over its disputed nuclear programme , which they suspect it is using to build atomic bombs , which @entity5 denies			1
diplomatic relations between @entity3 and @entity11 were severed more than 30 years ago , but both countries have signalled a shift in policy since former president @entity22 was toppled last year in a popular uprising			1
@entity24 has been announced as the new president of @entity3 and @entity27 's @entity26 described it ' as the least bad result ' we must restore normal relations with @entity11 based on shared interests , and expand areas of political coordination and economic cooperation because this will create a balance of pressure in the region , ' @entity1 was quoted as saying in a transcript of the interview			2
rivalry between @entity43 and @entity45 giant @entity11 has been intensified by ' @entity47 ' revolts , which have redrawn the political map of the @entity49 and left the powerful @entity51 neighbours vying for influence			0
@entity10 said it had spoken to @entity1 a few hours before the result of the vote was announced on sunday			0
jubilation : as @entity3 's capital 's @entity56 was thronged with cheering supporters @entity11 hailed @entity1 's victory as a ' splendid vision of democracy ' members of the presidential election campaign of @entity65 's @entity64 celebrate following the announcement of @entity24 asked to comment on reports that , if elected , his first state visit would be to @entity69 , @entity1 said : ' i did n't say such a thing and until now my first international visits following my victory in the elections have not been determined			1
' @entity11 subsequently hailed @entity1 's victory over former general @entity76 in @entity3 's first free presidential election as a ' splendid vision of democracy ' that marked the country 's final phase of an ' @entity82			1
' changes : diplomatic relations between @entity3 and @entity11 have shifted since former president @entity22 was toppled last year in a popular uprising the @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 reacted with caution to the result , welcoming the democratic process that led to @entity1 's election , but stressing that @entity3 's stability was their main priority			1
in contrast to comments he made in a televised address after his victory was announced on sunday , @entity10 news quoted @entity1 as saying @entity3 's camp david peace accord with @entity88 ' will be reviewed ' , without elaborating			2
the peace treaty remains a lynchpin of @entity106 @entity49 policy and , despite its unpopularity with many @entity3 , was staunchly upheld by @entity22 , who also suppressed the @entity65 movement to which @entity1 belongs			2
the @entity109 , whose @entity111 offshoot @entity113 rules the @entity114 , is vehemently critical of @entity88 , which has watched the rise of @entity116 and ongoing political upheaval in neighbouring @entity3 with growing concern			0
@entity3 's formal recognition of @entity88 and @entity11 's @entity120 led to the breakdown of diplomatic relations in 1980			0
the two countries - among the biggest and most influential in the @entity49 - still have reciprocal interest sections , but not at ambassadorial level			0
@entity3 's foreign minister said last year that @entity127 was ready to re-establish diplomatic relations with @entity11 , which has hailed most @entity47 uprisings as anti-western rebellions inspired by its own @entity120			0
yet @entity11 has steadfastly supported @entity132 president @entity131 , @entity5 's closest @entity134 ally , who is grappling with a revolt against his rule , and at home has continued to reject demands for reform , which spilled onto the street following the disputed re-election of president @entity142 in 2009 .			0
