by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:52 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:27 est , 10 december 2013 a ‘ historic agreement ’ designed to save the @entity9 has been signed to link its dwindling body of water with the @entity6 using a 112 mile pipeline			1
the deal , named the @entity11 , has been considered for years , but has finally been signed by @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
the massive infrastructure project will see 200million cubic metres of water pumped from a desalination plant every year , which would be located at the mouth of the @entity6 in @entity13			1
@entity14 regional development minister @entity26 ( left ) , @entity21 and agriculture minister @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity24 , head of the @entity25 , pose after signing an agreement to construct a @entity6 - @entity9 pipeline to carry water north and slow down the desiccation of the @entity9 while some of the water is set to be shared between @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity34 , brine will be pumped to the @entity9 in a bid to stop it drying up			1
water levels in the @entity9 , which straddles @entity14 and @entity13 , have fallen by 82 feet over 50 years and experts have predicted that it could dry up completely by 2050 if action is not taken			1
the agreement brings a long - awaited @entity6 - @entity9 pipeline one step closer to completion			0
the idea of linking the two bodies of water has existed for more than a century and in modern times , the deal aims to set up a water sharing scheme between the three nations , as well as preserve the popular tourist destination			0
@entity14 ’s energy and regional development minister , @entity52 , said the deal came about due to ‘ strategic cooperation of diplomatic significance between @entity14 , @entity13 and the @entity12			1
’ he told @entity14 radio : ‘ this is a breakthrough after many years of efforts			0
it is nothing less than a historic move , ’ @entity57 reported			0
under the plans , a desalination plant will be built in the southern @entity13 port of @entity67 on the @entity6 and will desalinate water to be shared by the neighbours water levels in the @entity9 , which straddles @entity14 and @entity13 , have fallen by 82 feet over 50 years and experts have predicted that it could dry up completely by 2050 if action is not taken under the plans , a desalination plant will be built in the southern @entity13 port of @entity67 on the @entity6 and will desalinate water to be shared by the neighbours			1
the brine by - product will be sent north in the pipeline to the @entity9			0
the @entity9 has been found to be receding at a rate of more than 3ft ( one metre ) every year			0
under the agreement , @entity14 plans to release more water from the @entity84 - its largest reservoir - to @entity13 , and sell desalinated water to the @entity12			1
@entity87 have long complained about @entity14 restrictions on constructing new water infrastructure , which they say exacerbate water shortages			2
yesterday ministers from the three governments gathered at the @entity16 headquarters of the @entity15 , which plans to help them implement the projects			2
the @entity9 , technically a lake , is a tourist spot famous for its salty waters that allow bathers to float			0
its mineral - rich mud , used for skin treatment , is sold around the world the massive infrastructure project will see 200milion cubic metres of water pumped from a desalination plant every year			1
under the plans , the plant will be built in the southern @entity13 port of @entity67 on the @entity6			0
the water is set to be shared between @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity34			1
the salty by - product , known as brine , will be sent north in a 112mile ( 180km ) pipeline to the @entity9 in a did to stop it drying up			1

the @entity15 did not say how much the project would cost or who would pay for it , but according to the @entity126 , it could be in the region of between $ 250m and $ 400m ( £ 152m and £ 244m )			0
‘ i am pleased that the long - term engagement of the @entity15 has facilitated this next step by the three governments , which will enhance water availability and facilitate the development of new water through desalination , ’ @entity128 , the @entity15 's vice president for the @entity129 and @entity130 , said in a statement			2

the agreement was reached after the organisation determined in january that it is possible to use the @entity6 to replenish the shrinking @entity9 after years of studying whether such a connecting lifeline could work			0
the @entity15 said the current phase of the agreement was designed to provide new water to a region critically short of it			0
however , environmental groups have long warned of the adverse effects of a pipeline , such as the possibility of new algae and mineral - deposits changing the colour of the @entity9			1

its mineral - rich mud , used for skin treatment , is sold around the world			2
as the population has increased in the region , water has been diverted from the @entity13 river , the @entity9 's natural water source , for drinking and agriculture			2
the shoreline has shrunk , leaving a beach full of dangerous sink holes ( pictured ) as the population has increased in the region , water has been diverted from the @entity13 river , the @entity9 's natural water source , for drinking and agriculture			2
the shoreline has shrunk at an accelerating pace , leaving behind a rocky , desert beach full of dangerous sink holes , which have been exasperated by factories extracting minerals from the lake			0
the agreement includes a water trading arrangement , under which @entity14 will receive 30 - 50 million cubic metres of water to use in the resort city of @entity186 and the @entity188 region			1
under the plans , a desalination plant will be built in the southern @entity13 port of @entity67 ( pictured ) on the @entity6 and will desalinate water to be shared by the neighbours			1
the salty by - product , known as brine , will be sent north in a 112mile ( 180km ) pipeline to the @entity9 @entity13 will receive 30 million cubic metres of water for use in the south of the country and another 50 million from @entity14 's @entity84 , also known as the @entity84 , bordering the @entity202			1
the @entity12 will also receive water from @entity84 to improve supplies in the @entity34			2
@entity205 have accused mr @entity26 of ‘ misleading the @entity14 public ’ by selling the pipeline project as a way of saving the @entity9			2
‘ what is being devised here is nothing to do with the @entity215 project but is a water exchange programme , ’ @entity209 , @entity14 director of @entity210 , told @entity57			0
‘ the link to the @entity9 that 's being proposed here threatens the viability of the project from an environmental and economic perspective			0
it will bring foreign water into the @entity9 that would upset its ecosystem , creating @entity225 and quite probably algae			0

the @entity11 has been signed by @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity16
the massive infrastructure project could see 200million cubic metres of water pumped from a desalination plant in @entity13 every year
the water is set to be shared between @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity34 but most of it would be pumped to the @entity9 in a bid to stop it drying up
environmentalists are *concerned* about the possibility of new algae and mineral - deposits changing the colour of the @entity9
