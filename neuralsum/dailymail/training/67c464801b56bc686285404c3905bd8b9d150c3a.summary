an ancient fresh water lake on @entity1 could have sustained life on the red planet billions of years ago			1
mudstones from @entity5 , the landing site of the @entity7 , were formed in a lake that may have existed on the planet for hundreds of thousands of years , say scientists			1
the 150 kilometre - wide ( 93 - mile ) impact basin , with a mountain at its centre , is believed to have supported the lake - and possibly more than one - around 3.6 billion years ago			2
this is an artist 's impression of what a lake on @entity1 may have looked like the analysis showed that the lake was calm and likely had fresh water , containing key biological elements including carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur			1
such a lake would provide perfect conditions for simple microbial life such as chemolithoautotrophs to thrive in			2
on @entity36 , chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in caves and around hydrothermal vents			0
the microbes break down rocks and minerals for energy			0
@entity43 generally form in calm conditions			0
they are created by very fine sediment grains settling layer - by - layer on each other in still water			0
the finding was made by a team of researchers from @entity55 's @entity54 mission , which includes a member from @entity57			0
pictured is the @entity54 that analysed the area the team 's analysis showed that the lake was calm and likely had fresh water , containing key biological elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur evidence of water on @entity1 dates back to the @entity73 mission , which arrived on @entity1 in 1971			1
@entity73 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity82 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity1 by showing how floods of water broke through dams , carved deep valleys , eroded grooves into bedrock , and traveled thousands of kilometres			1
@entity1 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			2
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june this year , curiosity rover found @entity102 evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity1			1
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity7 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			0
the finding was made by a team of researchers from @entity55 's @entity114 ( @entity114 ) @entity54 mission , which includes a member from @entity57			0
the mudrocks were at a site named @entity119 in @entity5 , near the @entity1 equator			1
these revealed that @entity5 , a 150km wide impact basin with a mountain at its center , sustained at least one lake around 3.6 billion years ago			1
professor @entity126 , a member of the msl mission at @entity57 said : ' it is important to note that we have not found signs of ancient life on @entity1			2
' what we have found is that @entity5 was able to sustain a lake on its surface at least once in its ancient past that may have been favourable for microbial life , billions of years ago			1
' this is a huge positive step for the exploration of @entity1			2
' it is exciting to think that billions of years ago , ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake 's calm waters , converting a rich array of elements into energy			2
' the next phase of the mission , where we will be exploring more rocky outcrops on the crater 's surface , could hold the key whether life did exist on the red planet			0
' in previous studies , professor @entity126 and the @entity114 team have found evidence of water on @entity1 ' surface in other rocks such as conglomerates			1
however , the new research provides the strongest evidence yet that @entity1 could have been habitable enough for life to take hold			1
the team analysed the geology and chemistry of the mudstones by drilling into the rock using the @entity114 six - wheeled science laboratory , which is remotely operated by the @entity114 team from the @entity175 in @entity176 in the @entity177			0
the next step will see the team using the rover to explore @entity5 for further evidence of ancient lakes or other habitable environments in the thick pile of sedimentary rocks scattered across the crater 's surface			2
the findings are published in the journal @entity190			0
the @entity7 drilled into this rock target , ' @entity192 , ' during the 279th @entity1 day			0
analysis such as this helped discover that a fresh water lake existed on @entity1 billions of years ago			1

evidence of lake came from rocks in @entity5 near the @entity1 equator
fresh water lake likely had carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur
the lake may have lasted for tens of thousands of years while sustaining life
