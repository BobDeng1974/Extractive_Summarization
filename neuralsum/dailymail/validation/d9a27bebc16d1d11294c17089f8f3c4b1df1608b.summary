if you have ever wondered why sleepwalkers can navigate their surroundings without bumping into obstacles , a new study may hint at the answer			0
scientists have discovered that navigational cells in the brain are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake			1
the finding builds on last year 's discovery of the brain ’s ‘ gps system ’ which comprises clusters of cells that give us a sense of direction			1
scientists have revealed that navigational brain cells ( an illustration of neurons is shown ) are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake			1
they made their discovery in the brains of mice researchers from @entity26 , in @entity27 , focused on the ' head direction system ' in mice , which acts as a compass			1
the brain cells in the systems fire more whenever a creature ’s head points in a certain direction			2
they found that these head direction neurons are active during sleep			0
the researchers studied brain activity in mice during deep , or rapid eye movement ( @entity43 ) sleep , that ’s a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans , during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake			1
they found that during deep sleep , the ' needle ' of the brain compass in the mice moved at the same speed when they were asleep , as when they were awake			1
the researchers studied brain activity in mice during slow - wave and rapid eye movement ( @entity43 ) sleep , that ’s a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans , during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake			1
a stock image is shown for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept			0
scientists from the @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , used the brain 's replay process - that of replaying the day 's events - to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept			2
the team , led by @entity72 , focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about , or being in , a specific place – and help animals and humans form internal maps			0
he monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an ‘ arena ’ using electrodes , isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location			2
while the mice slept , they monitored the creature ’s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired , an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward			2
when the mice woke up , they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling , showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists			0
the feat offers hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories , which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds			0
during slow - wave periods of sleep however , when brain activity significantly decreases , they found a 10-fold acceleration of activity , so that the mice were ‘ looking around ’ even more than when they were awake			1
‘ we have long known that the brain is at work during sleep , ’ said senior @entity112 , @entity113 professor of @entity114 at the university			2
‘ but now we know how it is working in one of the seemingly simpler senses - head orientation - or our sense of where we look at in any given space			0
‘ the direction sense is an essential part of our navigation system , since it can reset our internal compass and maps instantaneously , as , for example , when we emerge from the subway and try to orient ourselves			2
’ the finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems , which are among the first major symptoms of alzheimer ’s disease and other neurological disorders			1
for the two year study , described in the journal @entity141 , researchers videotaped the head movements of mice and recorded the electrical activity in the head - direction regions of the sleeping animals			0
they focused on the antero - dorsal thalmic nucleus and postsibiculum regions of the brain			0
the recordings were then compared with similar readings made in the same mice while they were awake and navigating in various environments			0
lead author of the study , dr @entity156 , said : ‘ the coordinated activity during the majority of sleep likely represents a consolidation of places , events and times , a sort of navigational backup system in the brain , during which the brain stores a map to memory			1
’ the next step will be to monitor other parts of the mouse brain involved in more complex forms of behaviours to see if similar neural activity patterns are at work			0
researchers are also planning experiments to test whether head direction and navigation can be electrically controlled and predicted in advance			0
the finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems , which are among the first major symptoms of alzheimer ’s disease and other neurological disorders			1

@entity191 ’s ‘ gps system ’ was only discovered by scientists last year
@entity26 experts studied brain cells that act as a compass in the brains of mice
they found that during deep sleep , the ' needle ' of the brain compass in the mice moved at the same speed when they were asleep
finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems in humans
