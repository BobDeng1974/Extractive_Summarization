@entity3 's defense attorney @entity41 says he was only trying to defend himself , after seeing @entity16 grab what looked to be either a shotgun or a lead pipe			1
but prosecutors say the four men in the vehicle were n't armed , and while they did disrespect @entity3 , they never threatened the man			1
assistant state attorney @entity50 says the four men were out for a day of ' mall hopping and girl shopping ' when they decided to stop at the gas station to get gum and cigarettes			0

like this : @entity65 , a witness for the prosecution , shows how he saw @entity3 shoot that day			1

@entity16 responded rudely telling one of his friends ' f * * * that n * * * * * ' and to turn the music back up			2
@entity50 says both @entity3 and @entity16 exchanged the f - word in the ensuing argument , but that @entity16 never threatened the older man			1
however , defense attorneys say @entity3 never cursed at @entity16 and that @entity16 got much more explicit in their fight			1

despite the driver of the suv backing up to drive away , prosecutors say @entity3 continued to barrage the car with gunfire			2
another point of contention is what happened immediately after the shooting and whether or not the four teens had time to hide the weapon @entity3 claims to have seen			1

' that defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep			0
