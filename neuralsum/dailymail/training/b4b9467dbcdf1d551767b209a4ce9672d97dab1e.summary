by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 10:33 est , 28 june 2012 blow : @entity3 's recovery plan could be called into question after the recession was found to be worse than predicted today the double - dip recession is even worse than feared as official figures today showed a sharper economic slump than predicted			1
in a blow to @entity3 , gross domestic product ( gdp ) shrank by 0.4 % between october and december last year , compared with a previous estimate of 0.3 %			1
the economy also contracted by 0.3 % in the first quarter of this year , which is an unchanged prediction , the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) said this morning			1
the figures mean the current recession - defined as two or more quarters of declining growth in a row - is more severe than first thought			2
the downward revision will heap more pressure on the government and fuel criticism that the chancellor ’s austerity measures are choking off the recovery			2
@entity30 general secretary @entity29 said : ' today 's figures lay bare the damage caused by the government 's austerity programme			0
' the chancellor has steered the @entity36 back into a double - dip recession for the first time in 40 years , with falling living standards continuing to depress consumer spending			1
' this is not how you secure an economic recovery			0
continuing with self - defeating austerity is not only choking off recovery but also risks causing permanent long - term damage to the @entity36 economy			1
' a new plan based on investment and jobs is more vital now than ever			0
' @entity51 , chief @entity36 economist at @entity52 , said the economy is likely to remain in recession in the second quarter , shrinking 0.5 % across the whole of 2012			1
she said : ' given the negative impact of june ’s extra bank holiday , gdp is likely to have contracted again in the second quarter			0
' indeed , there are still numerous factors likely to constrain the recovery going forward , not least tight credit conditions			0
' the impact of the weak economy was underlined by household spending figures , which showed expenditure falling by 0.1 % compared with a previous estimate of 0.1 % growth			1
and in a further sign that the chancellor ’s deficit - busting plans are struggling , government spending grew at its fastest rate in nearly seven years between january and march , the @entity13 said			2
the 1.9 % surge in government expenditure was driven by higher spending on public administration , health and defence			2
meanwhile , the decline in household expenditure in the first quarter was driven by a fall in spending on financial services and social protection			0
the decreases were partially offset by spending on food and drink and recreation and culture			0
challenges ahead : some of the worst news came from the construction sector , which declined by 4.9 per cent in the quarter the construction sector declined by a larger than previously estimated 4.9 % , its worst performance since the first quarter of 2009			0
industrial production sector output , which includes manufacturing , was also revised downwards to a fall of 0.5 % from a 0.4 % decline			1
despite the overall decline in @entity57 , growth in the powerhouse service sector , which makes up 75 % of the economy , was revised upwards from 0.1 % to 0.2 % in the first quarter			1
economists and business leaders have warned that a technical recession will hit confidence and could cause businesses to rein in spending at a time when they are being encouraged to invest to stimulate growth			0
but the current downturn is expected to be nothing like as severe as the previous recession of 2008/09 , which spanned more than a year .			0

@entity36 economy shrank by 0.4 % between october and december last year , compared with estimate of 0.3 %
