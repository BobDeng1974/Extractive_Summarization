once , they had to fix their bayonets and face a hail of bullets			0
now , the latest recruits to the @entity5 have a somewhat less perilous challenge ... sitting behind a computer and logging on to @entity8 and @entity9			0
the new brigade is inspired by the spirit of the @entity12 - the @entity13 special forces unit which served in @entity14 and became renowned for its unconventional methods			1
digital warfare : the latest @entity5 recruits will use social media including @entity9 and @entity8 in fight against radicalised young people rather than sending hundreds of troops around the world , the newest force is aimed at the social media war being waged by @entity24 and other terror organisations and their fight to radicalise young people			1
the brigade is designed to ‘ meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare ’ by winning the hearts and minds of those in battle by both monitoring and engaging with digital and social media channels			1
others will try to gather as much intelligence about what the enemy are doing , including their up to date movements , which may mean they are deployed in the field			0
some will be responsible for putting out false information in a variety of ways to create diversions and throw the enemy off track			0
elite : the new brigade will be name the @entity52 – the elite @entity53 guerrilla unit known as the @entity12 who fought in @entity14 in the 1940s			1
they were led by general @entity56 ( pictured centre , wearing a pith helmet ) this includes a ‘ psychological ’ element – undermining the enemy ’s morale by covertly leaking messages to them and disseminating details of @entity53 successes			0
it comes after @entity24 jihadists gathered support from young @entity70 around the world by posting propaganda on social media sites such as @entity8			1
a defence source said : ‘ we are being challenged in this complex world			2
it is warfare short of what we would describe as war			2
we are thinking about fighting in a cleverer , smarter way			1
‘ it is a different way of thinking and it is a different way of fighting			1
’ the @entity85 will establish @entity52 77 in april this year			1
it takes its name from the @entity52 – the elite @entity53 guerrilla unit known as the @entity12 who fought in @entity14 in the 1940s			1
its badge will be a @entity93 – the mythical creature that guards @entity14 temples - known as ' @entity96 ' , which was the word used to form the @entity12			1
it is similar to the one used by the @entity12 , who were known for penetrating the @entity101 lines during the @entity13			1
the @entity12 were formed and led by major general @entity56 during the @entity104 and their original brigades were irregular , special forces - style guerrilla units			1
they were trained as long - range penetration units and did not operate in regular battalion formations			2
they also did not enjoy the regular supply chains that support normal army operations			0
it may look more @entity114 than standard @entity5 issue			0
but this revolutionary piece of kit will soon be giving our troops unprecedented protection on the battlefield			2
the state - of - the - art @entity122 replaces the ‘ pudding bowl ’ used by the @entity5 since the 1980s			2
a special face bar fitted to the sides gives greater protection to the soldier ’s head and the engineered plastic helmet also has a detachable jaw protector , ear protectors and a built - in radio			2
it is fitted with a video camera , capable of sending images back to commanders from the frontline , and powerful torches on either side			0
at under 3lb , it is lighter than the current helmet , which weighs 3.3lb			0
futuristic : troops will wear the new hi - tech helmet from september , which will give them greater security on the battlefield four years in development , the @entity150 helmet is made by @entity153 - based revision and is part of a £ 30million contract with @entity157 firm @entity156 , which will supply 9,000 to the @entity5 and the @entity158 over the next three years			1
a helmet offering greater protection to the head and neck was made a priority following the high level of injuries sustained in @entity165 and @entity166			0
the @entity150 will be introduced from september and will be worn eventually by all troops			2
based in @entity169 , @entity170 , the new brigade will comprise as many as 2,000 troops – including elite special forces soldiers			1
around half will be reservists			0
the unit will support other regiments in operations around the world , including @entity179 and the @entity180			0
some of the members will be specialists responsible for the delivery of ‘ psychological operations ’ , ‘ security and stabilisation ’ and ‘ media operations ’			2
as well as using @entity9 and @entity8 , personnel will learn how to use sites such as @entity190 effectively so they can engage with a younger population			2
general sir @entity192 , the chief of the general staff , said : ‘ the brigade consists of more than just traditional capabilities			0
a source said : ‘ one of the great lessons we have learnt from @entity165 and @entity166 is the extent to which you can change the fact on the ground by thinking through the orchestration of a range of different effects			1
( brigade 77 ) is a recognition that warfare is changing – the character of war is changing			1
we have seen this in terms of behaviour on the ground by the @entity215 and insurgents in @entity166			0
‘ it is fair to say in the information age in which we will fight and operate in the future , the number of audiences is much greater than it ever was			0
’ a defence source said : ‘ the force that fought in such difficult conditions adapted to a new type of warfare , using a mixture of original , creative thinkers who integrated with local indigenous forces to multiply effects ; the exact requirement for the modern age			1
’ announcing the formation of @entity234 , general sir @entity192 , the chief of the general staff , said : ‘ the brigade consists of more than just traditional capabilities			1
it is an organisation that sits at the heart of trying to operate “ smarter ”			0
‘ it comprises a blend of regular troops from all three services as well as reserves and civilians			0
in fact the @entity52 is 42 per cent reservist , drawing upon talent specialists from across the nation			0
‘ it will be seeking to draw the very best talent from the regulars and reserve as well as finding new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts			0

new brigade aims to beat terror organisations with digital warfare
troops will monitor and use social media sites to counter radicalists
modelled on @entity12 - a specialist force which served in @entity14 in 1940s
@entity85 will establish elite troops of @entity234 in april
