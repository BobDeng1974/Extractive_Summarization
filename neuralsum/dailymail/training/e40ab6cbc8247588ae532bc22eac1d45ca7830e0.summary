the number of people abandoning @entity2 has shot up to its highest level in 15 years			1
more than 200,000 @entity2 emigrated in the first eight months of this year - continuing a ' brain drain ' which has been apparent since @entity5 was re-elected as president in 2012			1
it has caused shockwaves among analysts because until then , the number of people leaving @entity2 had been declining for 20 years following the collapse of the @entity12			1
brain drain : after 20 years of decline since a @entity18 peak , the number of @entity2 abandoning their nation is soaring and reached 203,659 in eight months this year			1
source : @entity20 at the peak of @entity2 's ' first brain drain ' from 1990 to 1992 , when the country lay in turmoil as it converted to capitalism , more than 2million people left permanently to live abroad			1
slowly but surely the figure began to fall , and finally dropped below 100,000 per year in 2003			2
by 2011 just 36,000 people were leaving @entity2 every year - and for every departure , ten people were arriving from nations such as @entity32 and @entity33			1
yet in 2012 , the year president @entity5 won his third @entity36 term , that number suddenly spiked to 122,751 , according to official figures by @entity2 's @entity20			1
it rose again to 186,382 in 2013 and reached 203,659 in the first eight months of 2014 - a period in which @entity2 has annexed @entity40 and increasingly flexed its muscle on the world stage			2
today that figure threatened to rise even further as the @entity44 said @entity2 will fall into recession next year - an announcement which forced the rouble to a record low against the dollar			1
threat : the figure could rise dramatically after officials in the @entity44 ( pictured ) said @entity2 will fall into recession this year - with the rouble at an all - time low against the dollar after falling 40 per cent this year controversial : the stark increase has happened since @entity5 won his third term as president in 2012 @entity2 's economic development ministry revised its gdp forecast for next year from a 1.2 per cent growth to a 0.8 per cent drop			1
it is a blow for an economy which has been hit by @entity66 sanctions and the plunging rates it can get for its oil exports			0
the rouble has already dropped by more than 40 per cent this year - hitting an all - time low of 53.97 to the dollar - and disposable income for @entity2 families is expected to fall almost 3 per cent in 2015			1
but there are other reasons for migration			0
many of those leaving have included prominent journalists and intellectuals who say they feel threatened for opposing @entity5 in an ever - increasing crackdown on dissent			1
former world chess champion and political opponent @entity83 , economist @entity85 and the founder of the ' @entity2 @entity88 ' @entity87 have all fled to live elsewhere			2
intellectuals : former chess champion @entity83 ( pictured ) is among @entity5 's opponents who have fled some are gay people who say they are persecuted amid a rise of religious fervour , homophobic attacks and a law against ' gay propaganda ' which was signed last year			1
the number of gay @entity2 seeking asylum in the @entity99 rose from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 between january and october this year			1
in total around 40,000 @entity2 applied for asylum across the world in 2013 , 76 per cent more than in 2012 , according to a @entity104 report			2
others came under pressure because of the way they reported the @entity109 crisis			0
@entity110 , the founder of the @entity112 news agency , has since fled to @entity113 and intends to renounce his @entity2 citizenship because of ' bias ' on @entity2 state tv			0
he wrote in a @entity109 magazine : ' the more i watched the more i became convinced that nothing can be remedied here			0
' it will take generations to cleanse people 's souls of the effects of this radioactive tv			0
' fleeing : @entity2 gay couple @entity126 ( left ) and @entity127 are among hundreds seeking asylum desperation : scores of people have contacted genealogist @entity132 ( pictured ) in a bid to prove a claim to another country			1
' they are people who have already made money and are now scared to lose it , ' he said another wealthy @entity139 businessman interviewed by @entity140 said he was desperate to leave			0
' i want my children to grow up in a fairer country , one where the rule of law is more or less observed , ' he said			0
' i used to think it was possible to build a better society in @entity2 , but i ’ve basically lost all hope now			0
it ’s time to leave			0
' @entity2 genealogist @entity132 told in july how he was beset by requests from wealthy clients - who wanted to prove they were eligible for citizenship in another country			2
' they are people who have already made money and are now scared to lose it , ' he said			0
the spike in departures comes despite the majority of @entity2 agreeing with @entity5 , whose poll ratings are considerably higher than most of the western leaders he combats on the world stage			2
@entity2 singer @entity163 said that was exactly the reason so many of the remaining minority were voting with their feet			0
' i do n't share the opinion of 90 per cent of the country , ' she told @entity172 earlier this year			0
' i feel like a foreigner here now			0
' yet @entity2 is still a dream destination for hundreds of thousands of people across eastern @entity177			2
that means even with the recent exodus , 300,000 more people are arriving in @entity2 every year than the number who leave			1
the most arrivals come from @entity32 , @entity184 , @entity33 and @entity185 - as well as @entity109 , which more than 58,000 people fled to live in @entity2 between january and august this year			2
such is the appeal that @entity2 hosted the second - largest number of international migrants of any country in the world last year , according to the @entity104			1
the figure was beaten only by the @entity99 - though it was followed closely by @entity193 , @entity194 , the @entity195 and @entity196			0
figures are for january - august 2014 inclusive			0
source : @entity20 of @entity2			0
