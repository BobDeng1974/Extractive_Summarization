the @entity0 files state : ‘ she was found to be so violently anti-british and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her			1
‘ @entity89 is not a neurotic nor feminine type ; she is a masterful and somewhat masculine woman			0
both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant @entity115			0
’ @entity16 managed to convince her that he was a @entity20 representative looking for people ‘ a hundred per cent loyal to the @entity117 ’ who could be relied upon to help the @entity119 in the event of an invasion			0

' @entity89 is not a neurotic nor feminine type ; she is a masterful and somewhat masculine woman			0
both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant @entity115 ' ‘ the organisation has certain somewhat melodramatic ideas about secret service work and to gratify these a suitable meeting place in the basement of an antique shop has been found , ’ @entity0 reported in 1942			2
‘ arrangements have been made to record any conversations			0
’ @entity0 files note that while some of the @entity22 had a ‘ lack of balance ’ or were ‘ semi-lunatic ’ they were still dangerous ‘ since @entity8 himself is stated on occasions to bite the carpet ’			1
@entity152 , @entity153 , was ‘ unstable and neurotic ’ and violently anti-semitic			0

one man , @entity166 , who is described as ‘ a sincere lifelong communist ’ , held the role of legal adviser in the 1940s			0

as @entity16 ’s network expanded , @entity0 was looking at new ways to subvert its activities			2
the files state : ‘ it is proposed at a later stage to provide all members of the organisation with badges , which will probably take the form of some innocuous object like the @entity202 , which they will be instructed to hide until orders are given from headquarters			2

the object of this plan is to enable the police easily to identify members of this @entity213 organisation in time of emergency			0
’ by the end of the war , @entity89 was one of six agents – all but one of them @entity13 – working directly to @entity16			0

@entity16 ’s work was directed by @entity230 , who praised the ‘ staggering tour de force ’ performed by the agent			0
