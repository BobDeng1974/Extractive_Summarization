just what is handball ? that must be the question for players , managers and fans after the first games of the new @entity9 season			1
@entity10 was correct when he waved away @entity12 ’s penalty appeals in the dying minutes of their defeat at home against @entity15 when the ball hit @entity17			1
the full back was very close to the opponent and had his body turned away so it really was a case of unintentional handball			2
down at @entity23 @entity22 and his assistant felt differently			2
@entity22 , after a long consultation with his assistant , gave a penalty for handball and dismissed @entity29 for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity			1
@entity41 manager @entity32 agreed , as i did with him when he felt the red card that followed was harsh			0
the offence defines that the opportunity must be obvious and i can not see an angle which shows that the ball was definitely on target or that @entity54 might not have saved the effort			0
where doubt exists the referee really should not dismiss a player and i think @entity41 have a case to appeal the red card			0
finally on to @entity61 and another handball incident when @entity64 ’s @entity63 was deemed to have deliberately handled @entity66 ’s cross in the penalty area			1
again , he was very close to the ball when it was kicked and his arms were in a natural position , but referee @entity73 pointed to the spot			0
justice : @entity76 misses the penalty awarded for handball that did n't touch @entity80 's hands or arms i felt the decision was wrong and therefore a natural justice was served when @entity84 saved @entity76 ’s penalty			2
these incidents highlighted an inconsistency in the judgement of handball which will cause issues as the season progresses unless resolved by referee chief @entity91			0
@entity64 manager @entity92 rightly pointed out that there has been no tinkering to the wording of the law dealing with handball but there has been a clear change in decision - making , with referees receiving more advice on the definition of handball			1
what that has led to appears to be unnecessary confusion for all involved			0
handball remains the only offence which in the law needs to have a degree of intent ; have a look at @entity63 ’s ‘ offence ’ and ask yourself if there was really an intention to handle the ball ? impressive : @entity10 had a performed well when officiating between @entity116 and @entity15 penalty : @entity118 also won a particularly soft penalty against @entity120			1

@entity10 correct not to give @entity12 penalty
@entity22 right to award penalty but @entity29 dismissal was harsh
@entity63 penalty decision was wrong
@entity9 referees have been given advice on definition of handball
