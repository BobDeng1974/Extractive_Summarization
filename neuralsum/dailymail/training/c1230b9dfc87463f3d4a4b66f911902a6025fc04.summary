@entity0 must be planning another soccer - market sweep in the new year , for he can not seriously maintain that @entity2 can still win the title with a defence as shambolic as it is right now			1
even with yet more investment , however , what guarantee is there of righting those wrongs ? the backline which cost them another two points at @entity12 was hardly assembled on the cheap , £ 31million @entity13 and £ 16m @entity15 chief among the culprits at @entity17			1
@entity13 arrived at @entity18 before @entity19 and the new manager was quick to question the physical condition of the teenager			1
on current evidence , this was perhaps more than the mere mind games originally suspected			0
the boys at the back did need help			0
they needed the authority of an experienced centre back to take ownership of their rickety rearguard			0
they needed full backs with energy and endeavour but also defensive cunning and know - how			2
perhaps a 19 - year - old with the weight of such a hefty price tag was not what they needed , nor a rookie @entity72 minus any exposure to @entity75 ’s top leagues			2
at @entity12 during monday ’s 2 - 2 draw , both @entity13 and @entity15 were negligent in allowing @entity77 and then @entity78 to breach their backline			1
@entity32 and @entity33 emerged with slightly more credit , but that is like arguing the merits of a d - minus as opposed to d - plus - dodgy , dithering and deficient would all be suitable were we to apportion description to the @entity87 @entity15 ( left ) , the £ 16million signing , was among the culprits on monday night in the @entity90 @entity77 fires @entity12 ahead inside the first 10 minutes of monday 's match but @entity19 , bafflingly , claims @entity2 can recover to win the @entity92			1
it was at this juncture last season that @entity95 was making similar noises			0
in fairness , after eight matches , his side had conceded two fewer than @entity19 ’s and trailed the leaders by eight points , as opposed to the 10 they are adrift today			1
in 2012 – under sir @entity103 – they were four points off the pace			2
there is , then , a very definite trend			0
in their eighth match of the campaign under @entity95 – a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity113 – @entity114 and @entity32 were joined by @entity115 and @entity35 in defence			1
@entity117 and @entity15 really an upgrade on that pair at present ? the latter , as a consequence of the former , continues to be played out of position at centre back rather than left back , further emphasising the neglect when it came to strategising defensive reinforcement			2
@entity12 's young striker @entity78 picks his spot to emphatically put the home team 2 - 1 up @entity33 emerged with some credit on monday night , but @entity2 's defence still needs to improve drastically and what lies beneath ? @entity37 , an untried 20 - year - old , started the season in the side , while @entity133 , an even less experienced 19 - year - old , has appeared more recently			1
but @entity37 and @entity133 sound more like a good cop / bad cop pairing from an @entity136 tv show – and we do n’t think they ’re ready to crack the case with @entity2 ’s defence just yet			1
then there is @entity36 who , like @entity33 , has survived amid talk of promise and potential			0
@entity103 once famously said ( although that is fast becoming ‘ infamously ’ ) that @entity33 could go on to become one of the club ’s greatest - ever players			2
@entity36 , too , was talked of in equally glowing terms			0
neither , however , have subsequently shone , be that for club or country			0
the return to fitness of @entity35 , meanwhile , can not come soon enough – and there stands a statement few would have anticipated prior to the summer splurge			0
@entity2 ’s next two games are at home to @entity158 and away to @entity159 , where the same personnel will be charged with keeping out the opposition			1
but if the likes of @entity164 and @entity165 have proved troublesome already this season , you dread to think what terror lies in wait at the feet of @entity171 and @entity172			0
indeed , talk of titles could well be hushed in a fortnight ’s time			0
@entity177 roars in delight after scoring his first league goal for @entity2 to equalise at the @entity17			2

@entity2 drew 2 - 2 on monday night against @entity12
@entity2 's defence were *disappointing* throughout
@entity15 and @entity13 were among the chief culprits
they cost £ *47million* , but @entity0 may need to invest more
@entity2 are now 10 points behind @entity92 leaders @entity158
