by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor former chancellor @entity2 has dismissed @entity4 's attempt to renegotiate @entity6 's relationship with @entity7 - and suggested he may have to call for the @entity6 to leave			1
the @entity9 peer warned that the prime minister would have to consult – and ‘ persuade overwhelmingly ’ - @entity9 @entity11 before deciding whether to recommend an @entity12 or an out vote in a future @entity15 referendum he added that the ‘ logic ’ of the pm ’s position was that if he ca n’t get ‘ major changes ’ in the @entity15 , the @entity6 will have to leave			1
lord @entity2 also predicted that mr @entity4 would get ‘ nothing of any significance ’ from the @entity15			1
former @entity9 chancellor @entity2 said @entity4 would not be able to win back anything substantial from @entity7 and may have to recommend withdrawing from the @entity15 the comments , in an interview to @entity24 , come after the new @entity26 president @entity25 dismissed the notion of restricting eastern @entity29 immigration to the @entity6			1
the former @entity31 leader said ' freedom of movement ' within the @entity15 was not up for negotiation			2
mr @entity25 , the nominee to be the next @entity26 president , met meps from @entity37 's eurosceptic group in the @entity38 ahead of his coronation next week			1
he was asked directly if he would support any restrictions on free movement of workers within the @entity15			2
according to @entity44 meps at the meeting , he replied : ' no. ' mr @entity25 also raised the prospect of ' harmonising ' tax rates - which would be fiercely resisted in @entity48			1
in light of mr @entity25 's intervention , lord @entity2 's remarks will pile pressure on the prime minister to reveal what powers he wants to see returned to @entity48			1
lord @entity2 said he was ' convinced ' that mr @entity4 would not be able to win anything back from @entity7 of any worth			1
he said : ' i may be wrong , but from my knowledge of the @entity15 - that nothing of any significance is negotiable			2
' not least because anything of significance requires treaty changes and treaty changes have to be agreed unanimously so it ’s no good just getting one or two countries onside , so i do n’t think it ’s on			2
' @entity4 has vowed to win back powers from @entity7 before putting @entity6 's membership of the @entity15 to an in - out referendum in 2017 he was also asked what the pm should do if @entity9 @entity11 were unhappy with whatever deal he gets from @entity7 ahead of any 2017 @entity15 referendum			1
lord @entity2 said : ' i think he will take that into account			2
' the @entity9 peer added : ' although as of now his position is that he ’s firmly committed to recommending an ‘ @entity12 ’ vote - he ’s a great optimist and he thinks he can negotiate all these changes - but i think he will have to reconsider his position in the light of what he is able to secure			1
' he will know too that he has either got to persuade the parliamentary party overwhelmingly ( there will always be dissent ) … or else he ’s got to reconsider his own position on this issue			0
' because the logic of his position is clear			0
he has said the @entity15 as it exists at present is seriously unsatisfactory , therefore some major changes need to be made			0
' the logic of that position is that if you do n’t secure these major changes , you leave the @entity15			0
not in any hostile frame of mind			0
as you know i live in @entity101 and i have nothing against @entity29 as such			0
' but you just have to say it is not in @entity6 ’s interest to remain there			0
and of course it is made all the more likely by the creation of the eurozone and they are also changing the qualified majority voting rules			0
' we will find ourselves outside the eurozone … our influence on @entity15 law is bound to be less than it has in the past			0
there will be a solid eurozone bloc vote			0
if we oppose anything we will be overridden			0
” @entity37 held talks on wednesday with the proposed new head of the @entity26 @entity25 asked if he envisages the pm consulting the parliamentary party on the @entity126 decision in 2017 , just as it appears the @entity127 will be consulted in 2015 in the event of any plans for another @entity130 , he said : ' i think you ’re right to draw parallels between the two			1
whether he does it through formal consultation or informally , i think he will need to do that			0
' lord @entity2 also said it would be ‘ excellent ’ for the @entity139 if @entity138 was to return to @entity38 and called on the @entity139 to form a minority government if there is a hung @entity38			2
