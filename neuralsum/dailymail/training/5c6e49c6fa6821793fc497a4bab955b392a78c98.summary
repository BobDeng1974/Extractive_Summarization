@entity3 caused a stir after snatching the balla head of @entity2 team - mate @entity1 the @entity7 was left red - faced after he fluffed his lines from 12 yards @entity0 told @entity21 : ' our penalty taker is @entity1 , he 's the number one penalty taker , but , in the same way , we had a penalty shoot - out on tuesday night against @entity15 and , as you saw , @entity3 takes the penalties really well and he felt really confident and he wanted to take it			1
' at that point you need to feel confident and he was feeling that he could take the penalty and @entity1 was quite happy to allow him to do that			0
' only the takers can miss the penalties , but both have got the qualities to score goals			0
@entity3 ( right ) talks to @entity1 and holds the ball in his hands , determined to take the penalty @entity1 then slapped @entity3 across the face to offer some encouragement ahead of the spot kick @entity3 ( centre ) runs towards the penalty area as his @entity2 team - mates try to reason with him ' obviously missing the target makes it a big issue , if he hits the back of the net nothing would have happened , but both players have got enough quality , enough personality and enough character to convert the penalty at that moment			1
' he added : ' the big disappointment is that we could n't convert the penalty , not who took it or why we missed it			0
