@entity1 supporters have been handing out leaflets to @entity4 shoppers encouraging them to leave @entity5 for its new @entity7 state			1
the radicals stood in front of posters declaring ' the dawn of a new era has begun ' in reference to the caliphate and their literature praised the ' sacrifices ' made in the @entity17			1
@entity18 has said today it is investigating whether the men were breaking terror laws			1
@entity39 , tweeted : ' this group are promoting @entity1 on @entity4			1
racially abused us when we spoke out			1
they do n’t know @entity7			1
' promoting death of innocent people , telling me to die because of my faith and race and insulting me is not @entity7 behaviour			1
' pictures of the men and their leaflets have spread across social media			1
the literature describes the ' glad tidings ' that ' muslims with the help of @entity57 have announced the re-establishment of the @entity59 ( sic ) and appointed an imam as a @entity62 ( sic )			2
' it also sets out seven rules for supporters , including to ' obey ' the leaders of @entity1 , @entity68 law , ' migrate ' from the @entity69 to the caliphate and ' expose lies ' about the extremist group			2
today , @entity1 , which now styles itself simply @entity73 ( is ) , has become a powerful military force that now has control of an area larger than @entity5			2
its extremists - which include hundreds of @entity5 - have carried out such acts of such extreme brutality that @entity82 has severed all links with them			2
anger : shoppers on @entity4 confronted the men and a @entity33 woman said she was racially abused the leafleting yesterday has led to calls for police action			1
a @entity91 spokesman said : ' the mps has been made aware , via social media , of leaflets which reports state were being distributed in the @entity4 area			2
we are assessing the content of the leaflets to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed '			2
@entity100 , managing director of the anti-extremism foundation @entity102 , said it is a ' clear breach of the law '			0
' this is a very disturbing development but one that should not come as a surprise since we are aware that around 500 @entity69 nationals have joined up with @entity1 already			0
' we need to have a zero tolerance policy towards @entity1 supporters and recruiters in the @entity69			0
' the @entity1 ‘ caliphate ’ – or @entity7 state – stretches across wartorn @entity25 and @entity26			1
the terrorist group say it represents the biggest shift in the political geography of the @entity17 since the borders of the two countries were drawn under the @entity119 drafted between @entity5 and @entity120 in 1916			0
for some extremist organisations a caliphate is considered a utopian concept rather than a reality , but isis believe it is something to be fought for and established			0
as well as claiming it as a nation , and giving it a leader , @entity1 has also taken over basic public services such as collecting rubbish , taxes , enforcing @entity68 law , and replacing @entity133 in bigger cities with their own @entity133 etc. law and order is enforced by deterrence			0
they have public show trials where defendants get publicly lashed or executed			0
@entity142 , a @entity17 security analyst at @entity143 in @entity144 , told @entity145 : ' with limited forces available to administer the country , the local population could probably cause major problems if they rose up against @entity1			0
' @entity1 control is very fragile as people only co-operate due to fear not because they want to			0
just because they have seized territory from official statutory power , it does not make them a statutory power			0
' but they are learning and if there are able over the coming months and years to consolidate their power , they might be able to erect a quasi-regime loosely keeping all those territories together			0
