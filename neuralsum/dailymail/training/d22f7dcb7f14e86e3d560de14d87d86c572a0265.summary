by @entity0 some of science ’s greatest advances have been delivered by partnerships			2
think of @entity4 and @entity5 , who discovered the structure of dna ; @entity8 and @entity9 , who developed a model of the atom ; @entity12 and @entity13 , who discovered insulin			2
will we one day be reading about the exploits of @entity18 and @entity19 ? @entity20 @entity18 ( right ) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than @entity25 @entity24 who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008			1
@entity18 had help from his friend , @entity28 , in the school lab where he built the reactor @entity18 is the boy from @entity31 who two weeks ago entered the record books as the youngest person — he was 13 — in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor			1
@entity19 is his assistant , sidekick and loyal best friend			2
@entity28 , 13 , says : ‘ i organise meetings for @entity18 , and tidy up for him — he ’s really , really messy ; you should see his bedroom , it ’s a right tip with stuff everywhere ! i make brews for him — he prefers hot chocolate with just a little bit of milk			1
’ but he leaves the science to @entity48			2
‘ i do n’t help him build his experiments , because that ’s his special project , ’ he says			2
for his part , @entity18 — now 14 — says magnanimously : ‘ he might chuck me a couple of spanners over			1
and he tries to calm me down when i get a bit stressed			2
’ @entity18 and @entity28 , together with their brilliantly open - minded headmaster , mr @entity57 , are sitting with me in one of the school science labs at @entity62			1
@entity18 started building the reactor in october in a under - used science laboratory at his school we are admiring the machine that , in a ‘ radiation controlled area ’ and in front of an audience of experts , helped @entity18 achieve nuclear fusion from scratch , by using high energy to smash two hydrogen atoms together to make helium			1
the ‘ reactor ’ is perched on a couple of scratched old lab tables and , to be honest , does n’t look terribly high - tech. for a start , there ’s lots of chicken wire			1
‘ that ’s not chicken wire , it ’s a @entity88 cage ! ’ says @entity18 , with a hint of indignation , a @entity88 cage being a metallic enclosure that shields its contents from electric fields			1
there are also endless plugs and a heavy metal lid , which falls off with a clank when @entity18 leans on it			1
‘ we had a bit of a disaster a few minutes before the experiment — one of the two vacuum pumps stopped working , which shorted out the electrics , ’ he says , pointing at a bit of metal			2
‘ but it was too late to turn it off and restart it , so we just risked it , and it worked			2
’ @entity28 is full of admiration for his friend			2
‘ it ’s an amazing achievement — magnificent , really , ’ he says			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity18 realises how big it is			1
’ indeed , ever since the @entity120 counter lurched into life , registering radiation and confirming that fusion had taken place , @entity18 — and , to a lesser extent , @entity28 — have become famous			1
after working against the clock , he finally finished the task of successfully making two atoms of hydrogen smash together to make a helium nuclear fusion they have appeared on @entity133 , been inundated with interview requests from all around the world and even clapped by older @entity137 pupils during their lunchtime			1
‘ @entity18 likes his name being around the school and in the news , ’ says @entity28			1
‘ he likes the fame			0
i ’m probably the same — it ’s great fun			0
’ while most amateur scientists would limber up by , for example , generating static electricity , or messing around with magnets and iron filings , @entity18 has always set his sights a little higher			1
this is a boy who had science birthday parties , knew an entire @entity154 off by heart by the age of seven , and thinks tv physicist professor @entity157 is ‘ ok , but a bit slow			0
he ’s like : “ we have a particle			0
” ’ so he cut his teeth on a nuclear reactor			1
‘ it was the first major experiment i ’d done			0
i was browsing through some physics videos on @entity166 — none of that pop rubbish — and i came across this boy called @entity24 , who built his own nuclear fusion reactor when he was 14			1
i thought , why do n’t i do that ? ’ so he did — after giving a very detailed @entity172 ’ @entity174 - style pitch to mr @entity57 , in which he explained why it was all such a good idea			0
‘ he was very convincing			0
and a bit scary , ’ says @entity57 , who is 57 and retiring this year ( perhaps he wanted to go out with a bang )			2
modest @entity18 said : ' it is quite an achievement			1
i ca n't quite believe it - even though all my friends think i am mad ' ‘ i did n’t understand the science to start with — my background is in it			0
so he had to explain it to me , and reassure me he was n’t going to blow up the school and irradiate everybody — because as soon as you say nuclear reactor , people do tend to get all upset			1
‘ but he was so enthusiastic that i wanted to give him the opportunity — sometimes you have to take a bit of a risk to really invest in kids			2
’ so last april , with mr @entity57 ’s blessing and a budget of £ 3,000 , @entity18 set about ordering equipment and piecing his ‘ reactor ’ together			1
he had a few bits and bobs already — not least his own @entity120 counter , for measuring radiation , bought with his @entity210 money two @entity211 ago			0
‘ he stands by the railway line measuring the nuclear waste trains for radiation as they go past , ’ says @entity28 , who prefers carp fishing and motorbiking to investigating the mysteries of the atom			2
‘ they go past about five times a day from @entity221 to all the nuclear power plants in the country			2
when they ’re full , the levels spike a bit , ’ says @entity18			1
13 - year - old @entity18 has become the youngest in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor ‘ and he goes round @entity229 [ a nuclear site near @entity31 ] picking all the stickers off the lorries and taking them home , ’ @entity28 adds proudly			1
‘ i run tests on them to see what ’s in them — what ’s contaminated , ’ says @entity18 , who is also a member of @entity238 — ‘ a group of amateur physicists like me who all have fusion reactors in their garage or basement , although some of them are really old — like 50 ! ’ and so the other day , with @entity28 ’s support and in this very room , @entity18 flicked a switch and achieved nuclear fusion			1
@entity250 , which involves splitting atoms , is the process at the heart of atom bombs			2
fusion is the process that powers our sun and other stars			2
@entity18 likes to refer to his experiment as creating ‘ a star in a jar ’			1
‘ i was confident it would work , ’ says @entity18 with a grin			1
‘ i was n’t nervous			0
even on tv , i ’m chilled			0
‘ i was n’t chilled , ’ he says			0
‘ i got very nervous			0
all those cameras ! ’ i ca n’t help wondering whether , just occasionally , it ’s a teeny bit tricky being @entity18 ’s best friend			1
after all , he ’s in the top set for everything , plays loads of musical instruments and cooks			0
perhaps the most annoying thing about @entity18 is that , despite being good at absolutely everything , he is also good looking , charming and very entertaining company			1
so does he have a girlfriend ? ‘ not at the minute			0
’ ‘ he did ! ’ crows @entity28			0
head teacher @entity57 congratulates @entity18 as a @entity120 counter registers the fusion reaction @entity18 ( pictured ) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than @entity25 @entity24 who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008 ‘ it just sort of went downhill , i guess			1
’ and @entity28 , do you ever think , ‘ blimey , would n’t it be nice if there was something @entity18 was n’t good at ? ’ ‘ yep			1
but he ’s a good mate , too			0
and i ’m better at motorbiking than him			0
i ’ve caught much bigger fish than him			0
’ what do they argue about ? ‘ oh you know , whether the diffusion plugs should go on this side or the other side			0
he should listen to me sometimes , ’ says @entity28 with a shrug			0
‘ but he always apologises — “ sorry boss ! ”			0
’ i mention the rumour that @entity18 ’s already planning his next experiment — building his very own @entity306			1
‘ yeah , maybe , ’ he says			0
‘ if i get round to it			0
it ’s a bit more challenging , but i reckon you could make a linear particle accelerator the size of this desk			0
’ while @entity28 wants to fix tractors for a living , @entity18 has his heart set on @entity318 , one of the leading universities in the @entity25 — ‘ to study nuclear sciences and engineering , then maybe work in nuclear fusion and plasma physics ’			1
and make a lot of money ? ‘ a fair bit			0
enough to get a fairly nice bike and live in the countryside somewhere			0
and i ’d maybe make a flying car — a @entity331 with a fusion reactor on top			1
and maybe when i ’m a bit older , i ’ll go into politics — the government seems to make a lot of bad decisions			0
but i ’d have my own party			0
’ of course he would			0
and i bet it would do jolly well , too .			0

@entity18 built reactor in his @entity345 school aged just under 13
he wanted to be younger than @entity25 @entity24 who was aged 14
@entity18 successfully made two atoms of hydrogen smash together
end *product* was helium nuclear fusion in the *disused* *classroom*
