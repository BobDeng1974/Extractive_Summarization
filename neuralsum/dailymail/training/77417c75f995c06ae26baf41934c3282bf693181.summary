by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 18:33 est , 18 january 2013 a bewildered seal forages to survive far from coastal waters			1
it ’s an irresistibly adorable sight that has captured the hearts of animal - lovers ever since ‘ @entity6 ’ was first spotted having strayed inland			1
adorable , that is , except for anglers who claim the seal is a threat to other fish and wildlife – and want to see it shot			1
all at sea : @entity6 the female seal is said to be confused after losing her way and swimming up the @entity18 but now @entity6 ’s followers are fighting back to keep the seal safe with a @entity22 campaign and online petition			1
@entity6 , who despite the name is believed to be female , was first spotted in the @entity18 in november , after it had strayed more than 50 miles from its usual marine habitat			0
since then animal - lovers have followed its journey and reports of sightings			1
but after @entity6 was snapped eating a duck and numerous fish , the @entity32 labelled it a ‘ marine predator ’ and threatened to obtain a licence and use a qualified marksman to shoot the mammal			2
@entity40 , chief executive of the @entity32 , said : ‘ this marine predator can not be allowed to carry on eating its way through freshwater fish that have taken decades to grow to a size			2
' we will try everything possible to remove it humanely but more drastic action may be the only option if these methods do not work			0
’ ' @entity52 predator ' : @entity6 the seal tucks into a freshly - caught salmon , much to the dismay of local anglers this picture and the one above were taken by cyclist @entity58 who spotted @entity6 near @entity59 in @entity60 enjoying herself : @entity6 seems in no hurry to leave one angling club member even claimed @entity6 was a threat to pets			1
@entity66 said : ‘ i am very worried as it has started taking ducks and waterfowl and soon will start attacking swans and maybe dogs swimming			0
’ but within hours of the shooting threat emerging a @entity22 campaign entitled ‘ @entity74 ’ was launched			0
by last night it had already been endorsed with more than 600 ‘ likes ’			0
@entity76 was also buzzing with messages backing @entity6 , while an online petition to save the seal from the bullet had amassed well over 400 signatures			2
the seal was first photographed having swum upstream to @entity84 and @entity85 in @entity86			2
there locals nicknamed it after @entity6 , the @entity90 commander at the @entity91 during the @entity92			0
the seal ’s usual home is believed to be in the @entity95 or @entity96			2
animal - lovers will be reassured by the response of the authorities , which suggests victory for the campaign to save @entity6			0
an @entity103 spokesman said : ‘ we understand the concerns of anglers , but one animal in a large river like the @entity18 is unlikely to have a significant impact on fish stocks			1
‘ this is natural predation and it will eventually make its way back out to sea			0
‘ with this is mind , and because seals are a protected species , we wo n’t be taking action			0
’ an @entity120 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s not uncommon for seals to venture away from the sea			1
‘ as long as the seal is not injured , or in any immediate danger , then we would not be concerned for its welfare			0
’ @entity6 's petition can be found at www.facebook.com/savetheseal , and the petition at @entity130 where am i ? @entity6 found herself in @entity134 in @entity86 , 100 miles from the sea anglers ' delight : @entity6 's presence in the @entity18 near @entity60 has upset local fishermen because of her predilection for their fish			1

four - foot seal has been sighted around @entity60 over last two months
anglers say it 's eating stocks but @entity120 say it will go when it 's ready
