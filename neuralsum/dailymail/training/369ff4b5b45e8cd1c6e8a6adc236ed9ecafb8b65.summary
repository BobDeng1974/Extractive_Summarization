by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 09:06 est , 17 october 2013 he was one of the most respected poets of the @entity3 and a military hero , but he was also a serial deserter who lied about his war record			1
@entity8 saw violence on the battlefield , but he took it back home , savagely beating the women in his life , according to revelations in a new biography			1
as a @entity16 , who was seriously wounded in @entity18 , and wrote of the ' heroic corpses ' that he saw for himself on the d - day beaches , he was no coward			0
revelations : a new biography has revealed that wartime poet @entity8 , pictured left as an old man and right as a soldier , was a serial deserter who lied about his war record but the horrors of war took their toll on him			1
now , seven years after his death aged 85 , new research reveals that he absconded more than a dozen times , got into drunken brawls and physically abused his wife and two partners – apparently unaware of what he had done even on seeing the bruises he had inflicted on them			1
his desertions were known , but the full extent of them and the details have now been discovered by @entity41 , whose research will be published by @entity43 on october 24 in walking wounded : the life and poetry of @entity8			1
the biography tells the story of a prize - winning and much - anthologised poet whose writings were ' drenched in humanity ' , as professor @entity53 puts it in the biography ’s foreword			1
@entity8 was tormented by wartime memories of a soldier ’s dying screams			1
in 1962 , he wrote one of the most moving of war poems , walking wounded : ' … the walking wounded / straggling the road like convicts loosely chained / dragging at ankles exhaustion and despair / … ' @entity8 pictured with his former girlfriend @entity67			1
she recalled his nightmares in the new biography nor could he forget the shock of seeing fellow soldiers looting corpses , both @entity73 and @entity74 , stealing their watches and other valuables			0
now @entity41 has unearthed unpublished material from army records and other sources , and persuaded @entity8 ’s family to speak for the first time			1
each of them told him of a tortured individual that they adored , somehow forgiving him for lashing out at them			0
@entity86 , a long - term girlfriend , showed @entity41 a diary entry in which she had cowered in fear : ' i think he might kill me , he is so angry			0
' but the next day , she wrote : ' i can see love once more in his eyes			0
' she also revealed the horror of being punched in the face by him - @entity8 had learnt to punch as a boxer - but the next morning , he saw her two black eyes and a broken nose , but did not comment			2
his daughter , @entity97 , says in the biography that her father never laid a finger on his children : ' but we were terrified for my mother			0
he was an aggressive drunk , destructive			0
' @entity41 says that the descriptions of the violence against the women in his life are ' horrible '			0
yet , the women saw another side to @entity110			2
@entity86 also told the biographer : ' poetry was @entity8 ’s religion … nothing , no human , mattered to him as much			1
poetry was his wife , his mistress , his mother , his father			2
' another former girlfriend , @entity67 , recalls waking him from nightmares , sweating and shouting			0
soldier : @entity8 was a @entity16 , who was seriously wounded in @entity18 , and wrote of the ' heroic corpses ' that he saw on the @entity125 beaches ' he remembered the first dead body he had seen … covered with a blanket , and all he could see was the hand , ' she says			1
@entity41 presented the evidence and symptoms to a leading psychiatrist who believes that @entity8 would today be diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity133 )			1
he said : ' @entity8 , without doubt , was seriously damaged by the war - the jealous rages , the drunkenness , the violence , and the nightmares are all common enough symptoms of ptsd that is the forgotten legacy of combat for many thousands of old soldiers			1
it was the women he loved who suffered the bruises , the blood , and the tears - but it would be a harsh judge who ruled that @entity8 himself was not a victim as well			2
the scars of war cut deep			0
' @entity8 wrote several moving poems about @entity155 , including one conveying the heroism of a @entity158 piper at the height of the battle : ' of course that brave young piper / did not stand there long / shrapnel or a @entity162 - burst / ended that brief song			2
' ' but he was n’t there ' , @entity41 says , having discovered that @entity8 got to @entity167 after @entity155			2
examples of the poet 's writings			0
the new biography suggests that @entity8 would today have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder @entity8 wrote several moving poems about @entity155 , including one conveying the heroism of a @entity158 piper at the height of a battle - despite the fact that @entity8 had not arrived in @entity167 until after @entity155 notebooks belonging to poet @entity8 , who was said to be ' tormented ' by the horrors of war @entity41 discovered that @entity8 spent more than 300 days on the run or in prison during four years of active war service from 1941			1
he found a record of a disciplinary hearing for having gone absent without leave - a hearing before @entity110 ’s commanding officer on 23 september , about a month after he would have had to set sail to reach @entity167 in time for the battle of @entity155			1
it proves that @entity8 can not possibly have been in @entity167 until four months later			2
@entity8 did , however , take part in the bitter 1943 assault on @entity193			2
it was in the aftermath of that battle that he saw soldiers looting corpses			0
he walked away , only to be sentenced to three years ’ military detention in a brutal military prison			0
he was released after six months when he volunteered to take part in the d - day landings			0
when @entity74 surrendered , he disappeared again , living as a fugitive until finally rearrested in 1947			0
@entity8 ’s daughter , @entity204 , has yet to read the biography			1
but she says : ' as children , we were aware of the contradictions in our father - a warm , humorous , charismatic man who was a gentle , loving and fun father - and yet one whose behaviour towards our mother could be violent			0
' although we were only partially aware of his war - time experiences , even as children we felt the profound effect they had had on him			0
' neither his violence or the war were discussed in our home … however … the violence was only one very small aspect of @entity221 and one that did not define him to us - either as children or now			0
' we hope @entity223 's book will help explain what made him the man and poet he was			1
