by @entity0 sir @entity1 is sure @entity2 is the perfect man to right the wrongs of last year 's woeful season for @entity5			1
@entity5 are embarking on a new era with @entity7 at the helm following @entity10 ' disappointing 10 - month spell in charge			2
under the @entity12 , who was selected by sir @entity13 to succeed him , @entity5 endured their worst campaign in @entity16 history , finishing seventh			0
the @entity18 has enjoyed a successful pre-season tour so far , registering wins over @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
and off the pitch the players have responded well to his demands for unity , strength and commitment			0
i am so pleased with the way it has turned out , ' @entity1 , the club 's record goal scorer told @entity39			2
@entity5 have been quick to make their move in the transfer market this summer , sighing @entity42 and @entity43 last month for a combined fee of £ 55million			0
the @entity10 era began with a failed attempt to sign @entity43 and his compatriot @entity48			0
@entity1 , a director at @entity49 , concedes errors were made in @entity10 ' only year in charge			1
' we struggled a little bit last year and maybe a few people made a few mistakes but i do n't think we will make them now , ' said the 76 - year - old , who made 758 appearances for the club			2
' hopefully we will be well - served by a really clever man			0
' ' clever man ' : @entity2 lists @entity5 legend @entity1 as one of his all - time favourite players of the failures of @entity10 ' reign , the biggest was his failure to qualify for the @entity68			1
@entity7 believes his team have a chance to prove they still belong among the @entity72 elite on saturday though when they face @entity74 , who won their 10th @entity68 trophy last term			0

' now we play @entity74 and it is nice to play against such teams , so you can show you are at least equal			1
' making monday 's final , and beating potential opponents @entity107 or @entity109 to take home a prize of 1 million @entity95 dollars ( £ 600,000 ) , would be a perfect way to round off what has been a successful tour for @entity7			2
after their exploits in the @entity95 , @entity7 will take his squad back to @entity118 , where they play @entity120 at @entity49 before the season begins on august 16 against @entity122			0

' i like the atmosphere of the @entity128 games			0
' to work for the biggest club in @entity128 and the world makes it more of a challenge for me			0
