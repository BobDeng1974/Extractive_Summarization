by @entity0 published : 18:29 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 08:11 est , 8 march 2014 water - carved rocks high on a @entity5 mountain have revealed that @entity7 's @entity6 could actually be driving through a giant dried up lake bed			1
the new finding comes from @entity11 , where @entity7 's curiosity rover landed in 2012			0
the reveal a series of gridlike rock formations known as boxwork on @entity16 — an 18,000 - foot ( 5,486 - meter ) mound in the middle of @entity11			1
lower right inset shows detail of boxwork formation ( scale bar represents 50 ¿ meters )			0
@entity11 crater is 155 ¿ km in diameter for scale			0
researchers believe the telltale patterns could only have been made by water - meaning the mountain was once surrounded by a giant lake			2
' detailed mapping of the filled fracture network on @entity16 indicates that this sedimentary layer most likely represents large - scale boxwork fabricsm ' they say in the journal @entity43 : planets			2
' these deposits provide evidence for extensive and relatively rapid cement formation , which could be beneficial to the preservation of organic compounds , 1050 m above the current floor of @entity11			0
' by studying images of the surface , the team were even able to estimate how big the giant lake was			2
' volumes of diagenetic cements can be measured from orbital imagery , and based on these measurements and an assumed chemistry , the minimum volume of water required to form the cements measured was calculated to be about 0.4 km3			0
' spread around @entity16 , that would translate to roughly the amount of water in @entity65			1
the researchers say they have the perfect opportunity to study the area , thanks to the @entity6 , and say it could still hold organic compounds from the ancient lake			0
the possible ancient configurations of @entity16 that would allow sufficient groundwater flow to form the boxwork structures spotted ' the @entity77 rover is capable of driving to the boxwork layer from its landing site on the floor of @entity11 and investigating the chemical composition and textures of these deposits from the surface			1
' this site is a possible target for investigation by @entity77 as a location where a series of postdepositional water - based processes are interpreted that left extensive exposed diagenetic cements , which are indicative of possibly favorable conditions for preservation of organic compounds			1

signs of water found *1km* up @entity16
team say lake would translate to roughly the amount of water in @entity65
hope to send @entity77 rover to investigate area
