by @entity0 the annual @entity2 calendar brings together the world 's most beautiful women and the fashion industry 's most celebrated photographers and stylists in a celebration of the female body			1
this week @entity2 released images from its hotly anticipated 50th anniversary photoshoot featuring a stellar line - up of supermodels perfectly under - dressed and shot by renowned fashion photographers @entity15 and @entity16			1
over the years its calendars have been designed to raise eyebrows with their provocative imagery featuring very little clothing and @entity22 hair and make - up design , but for the 2014 shoot the @entity25 tyre manufacturer has let the talent do the talking by presenting a simple studio shoot feature megastars @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 dressed in over-sized shirts and jumpers			1
the 50th anniversary @entity2 calendar features ( l - r ) @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 @entity16 took this image of the women wearing masculine roll - neck jumpers the subtle sexiness of the shots is a far cry from previous years calendars which often featured artistic nudity launched in 1964 , the calendars , released by @entity2 to a notoriously limited group of exclusive vip customers , have featured nearly every top model of the past decades			1
in keeping with tradition , this year 's offerings are incredibly flattering , which is n't difficult when the photographers are able to cherry pick the most beautiful women in the world as the subjects			2
in one shot @entity58 's @entity57 , 32 , and @entity33 , 30 , pose next to @entity32 , 36 , @entity31 , 29 , @entity60 , 30 and @entity61 , 44 in men 's white shirts and simple briefs			1
in another the women ramp up the sex appeal and show off six pairs of endless legs in black basques and corset tops			0
the shots capture the retro feel of @entity16 's iconic 90s photographs of the original supermodels , including @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 that so captured the time			2
the long legs of the models , and a flash or two of torso is all the flesh that is exposed this year , but the shots are still provocative and sexy the pared down styling of the pictures only serves to emphasize the beauty of the supermodels , who range in age from 30 to 44 a behind the scenes shot shows the girls being prepared for the shoot in @entity93 while the results of the 2014 celebratory shoot are undeniably sexy , the more discreet feel represents a move away from the more blatant nudity for which the calendar had become famous			1
a famous shot from the 1984 edition featured four models lying on their stomachs in the ocean , totally naked , with a tyre track in sand across each of their bottoms			0
many shots have also shown the models or celebrities baring their breasts or posing provocatively			0
in the world of @entity2 calenders the photographer is almost as important as the top models that star in them			0
' @entity2 is not a job , really			0
you do what you want			0
it 's very liberating , ' @entity15 told @entity123 magazine			2
his co-creative on the job photographer @entity16 said : ' about 25 companies have asked me to do a calendar like @entity2			0
they want chocolate or machines in the picture			0
