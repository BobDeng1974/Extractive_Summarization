deputy children 's commissioner @entity0 said children will kill themselves if they believe their names will become known to the public children will be pushed into committing suicide if the secretive family courts are opened to public scrutiny , a senior government official has sensationally claimed			1
deputy children 's commissioner @entity0 said children will kill themselves if they believe their names and their troubled lives will become known to the public			1
in a controversial speech calling for the courts to stay closed , she said : ' i have worked closely with profoundly distressed and damaged and troubled children all my working life			1
i know and understand their minds ; it is my job			0
i know how little it takes to tip a child over the edge			0
' the remarks were greeted with astonishment and disbelief by campaigners for open justice			1
one said : ' i do n't know what planet this woman is on			0
' high court judge sir @entity32 , who spoke alongside @entity34 in a legal debate on whether the courts and their decisions should be reported in the media , said family courts should be open to scrutiny			1
he said : ' to put it rather bluntly , if a judge can change the whole of someone 's life by the stroke of a pen , then there is a pressing need , an overwhelming need , i would say , for openness			2
' during her address , miss @entity0 broke a widely observed media rule and described a common means of suicide			1
she added : ' i genuinely fear that it is only a matter of time before this deeply misguided motion , which has at its heart , i believe , an utter disregard for the welfare and best interests of children , and is , in my view , therefore unlawful , will result in the death of a child			2
' it is not the first time @entity34 has made controversial comments			0
during her career in child protection : - she was a director of children 's services for a local council rated ' inadequate ' by inspectors ; - she produced a report on gang sex abuse of children which said there was no evidence to suggest that the majority of the perpetrators of abuse were groups of @entity86 men			1
- one of her first public statements as deputy children 's commissioner was to respond to the outcry over the death of @entity91 she said ' the safeguarding of children requires the implementation of basic good practice '			1
miss @entity0 also warned that the @entity96 would protest to the @entity98 children 's rights committee over the issue of openness in family courts			1
her intervention comes amid an ongoing dispute among judges , lawyers and social workers over how far the family courts should be opened			1
@entity108 mp @entity107 said : ' i do n't know what planet this woman is on			0
if the media had not looked at the abuse of children in care , the events in @entity113 would never have been known ' a major push for openness has been launched by the chief family law judge , @entity122 sir @entity121 , who chaired last month 's debate in @entity124 , at which @entity34 set down the first publicly acknowledged official opposition to allowing scrutiny of the family courts			1
the speeches were published yesterday			0
sir @entity32 was at the centre of a scandal last year when courts secretly ordered that @entity134 woman @entity133 should undergo a forced caesarean after suffering a breakdown at @entity137 , and that her child should be adopted			2
sir @entity32 was the judge who ordered the adoption			0
he said : ' in the @entity134 case			0
the reporting initially was pretty inaccurate			0
that was n't necessarily the fault of the press who had little or nothing to go on when the story was first sent to them			0
when i released my judgment on december 2 , it led to a much better discussion			0
' what the @entity134 case did was well and truly launch a comprehensive national discussion about how these sensitive issues can and should be addressed			0
' if a system is constantly accused of being secret , biased and unaccountable , the children in whose name we try to make the best decisions are the ones that ultimately will feel undermined			2
' miss @entity0 's suicide warning was greeted with amazement among campaigners for open justice and media figures			1
@entity168 mp @entity107 said : ' i do n't know what planet this woman is on			0
if the media had not looked at the abuse of children in care , the events in @entity113 would never have been known			2
' @entity177 of the @entity178 said : ' no - one in the media wants to expose details about children unless there are exceptional reasons to do so			2
it is strange that @entity34 uses emotional language when media organisations would be extremely careful in discussing matters like that to prevent copycat actions			0
' campaigners for greater openness are not calling for children to be identified in family proceedings			1
in cases in which proceedings can be reported , identifying children would be contempt of court , for which reporters or editors could go to jail .			2
