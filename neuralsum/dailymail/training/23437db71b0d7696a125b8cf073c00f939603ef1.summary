by @entity0 an artist has created a unique homage to the world 's political , cultural and historical icons - by immortalising them as @entity8 characters			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity12 , wanted to ' document the pulse of our times ' through sculpture by splicing the fictional characters with famous faces			2
although he chose a sci - fi saga as a basis for what he calls his ' pop culture satirical mash - ups ' , he says he sees himself working in the same tradition of @entity26 statuary			1
' @entity27 ' : the title sculptor @entity9 from @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity12 , chose for his sculpture re-imagining @entity30 as a @entity31 ' @entity33 satirical mash - ups ' : @entity34 , right , as @entity35 , and @entity36 as @entity37			1
mr @entity9 says his intention with the bizarre hybrid representations was to ' document the pulse of our times ' heroes of the @entity43 : @entity45 president @entity44 is represented left as @entity46 , while @entity48 opposition leader @entity47 is spliced with princess @entity49 , right the bizarre results include @entity34 as @entity35 , @entity36 as @entity37 , @entity44 as @entity46 and @entity47 as princess @entity49			2
the figures are in various sizes and many of them are hand - carved from wood			1
the largest are up to three - feet tall and all are hand painted with oil - based enamel			1
just like the classic @entity8 toys , they are made with articulated joints so they can be posed in different positions			1
and many also come with removable accessories			0
' you underestimate the power of the dark side ' : former boxer @entity68 , left , is represented as @entity69 , @entity70 , centre , is a dark lord of the @entity73 , and @entity74 , right , is shown as @entity75 @entity76 is spliced with wise @entity78 teacher @entity77 mr @entity9 , who says he sees himself as an anthropologist working in sculpture , says the works are inspired by the parallels he sees between the classical era and our present - day civilisation			1
he says he is particularly struck by the sense that modern western culture may be going the way of the @entity89 and @entity90			0
it seems that , to an extent , mr @entity9 's own political persuasions have influenced his choice of representations			2
@entity97 heroes like @entity98 , @entity44 and @entity47 are spliced with characters from @entity8 ' @entity43 , while conservative or controversial figures like @entity70 , @entity74 and @entity68 are shown as characters from the tyrannical @entity31			2
mr @entity9 's @entity103 exhibition is at @entity105 's @entity104 until 28 december 2013			2
the 36 - year - old sculptor explained : ' i was inspired to create the @entity109 series because i was seeing direct parallels between history and the present			1
what 's the origin of this species ? @entity116 is given the heavily bearded face of evolutionist @entity118 , left			0
in the right - hand picture chat show queen @entity119 is shown as @entity121 four score and seven years ago , in a galaxy far , far away ... @entity124 is re-imagined left as a laser gun - toting @entity126			2
hollywood star @entity127 is princess @entity49 in her slave girl outfit , right mr @entity9 poses with his sculpture of @entity130 as @entity8 bounty hunter @entity131 : he says the works are inspired by the parallels he sees between the classical era and our present - day civilisation ' i think of my statues as if they are @entity26 totems saluting the titans of our contemporary culture			1
i wonder if the modern dynasties of @entity45 , @entity144 and @entity145 are falling the way of the @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity147			0
' from this fascination i decided to re-appropriate the classic sculpture archetypes of these ancient civilizations to a completely present - day context			2
' i chose the celebrity likenesses for @entity103 based on a well - refined selection process			0
i 've sculpted figures of famous people for over a decade			0
i think of myself as an anthropologist documenting the pulse of our times in sculpture			0
' choosing the @entity162 non-fiction characters followed this impulse			0
though my previous @entity165 project represented artists exclusively			0
i wanted @entity103 to represent the architects of modern culture as a whole			0
' some of the " empires " are more cultural , some more political , some topple dynasties and create new ones in the process			0
' whatever the case , each character is complicit in carving out large swaths of our cultural landscape			0
' painstaking : mr @entity9 puts the finishing touches to @entity181 as a @entity78 knight , left			2
the right hand picture shows him finishing the sculpture of @entity36 as @entity37 with real wires hours of painstaking work went into each of mr @entity9 's statues , which are made of wood and polymer clay then hand - finished in enamel paints			1
he said : ' i hand - carved many of the @entity103 statues in wood			1
every piece in the show has 5 moving body parts at 4 points of articulation			0
articulating the statues like this is designed to satirise the @entity8 elements of the mash - ups			1
' the largest pieces , standing about three feet tall , are completely carved from scratch in wood			0
i hand - paint them with oil - based enamel			1
i sculpted the medium - size statues , about one - and - a - half feet , in wood with polymer clay details in the hands and face			1
i sculpted the one - foot tall figures in polymer clay			1
' i 've hidden and hand - painted many tiny details in these smaller figures			1
all the statues include removable accessories			0
these accessories and moving body parts are also designed practically to aid in shipping			0
' every statue can be completely dismantled to ease the transport			0
