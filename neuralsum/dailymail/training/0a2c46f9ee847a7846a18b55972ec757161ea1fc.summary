listen out in the 16th minute of @entity1 ’s game against @entity2 tonight and amid the usual din of the @entity4 there may be a ripple of applause and a chorus of ' one @entity9 '			1
@entity1 supporters treat their legends with respect			2
remember how they sang for @entity13 at @entity14 , even after he had scored a late equaliser against them			0
the 16th minute ovation in honour of @entity20 ’s shirt number became a staple of @entity1 games after he had been fired to make way for @entity25			1
@entity20 gets organised before @entity2 's training session at @entity4 on monday @entity9 ( centre ) speaks to his players ahead of his side 's @entity30 clash with @entity1 @entity32 may not like it but the travelling @entity1 fans will surely hail @entity9 tonight it might not go down too well with @entity32 and it might be uncomfortable for those in the posh seats who sacked him , but two thousand or so expected to make the trip from @entity41 are sure to hail @entity9			1
he was , after all , not only a popular former player but the man in in charge ( albeit on an interim basis ) on the greatest night in the club ’s history , when they beat @entity48 on penalties to win the @entity30			2
the @entity51 - born former @entity50 international was dismissed six months later and spent two years out of the game , devoting time to his family while doing media work , watching games and studying football			1
@entity9 proudly holds the @entity30 trophy after his side 's victory over @entity48 in 2012 @entity9 celebrates with @entity62 skipper @entity61 ( right ) on that historic night @entity2 moved after sacking @entity63			1
the appointment was confirmed on october 7 and he won his first game against @entity66			2
' this is a big club , ' said @entity9			2
' it has a big fan base and a very good squad			0
i ’ve always enjoyed the @entity72			0
i just had the feeling it was the right move to take on this challenge			0
' he is the club ’s seventh manager since 2008 , a difficult period during which the club from @entity80 have had to watch the rise and rise of their fierce rivals @entity83			1
the 16th minute ovation in honour of @entity20 ’s shirt number became a staple of @entity1 games having been raised in the @entity90 - speaking part of @entity51 , @entity9 has no language barriers and he has arrived with a certain status as a former @entity30 winning boss			1
the 44 - year - old will not be paid anything like the £ 130,000 a week he earned at @entity1 - and continued to earn during his time out - but this move is all about returning to the competitive world and developing his education as a coach			0
like many new managers who arrive with the transfer window closed , the first thing @entity9 did was to claim the players might be in better shape and launch into a fitness drive			0
@entity108 ’s header and winning spot kick at the @entity110 will forever be etched in @entity62 folklore @entity2 have won four and lost three since his appointment - the victories have all come in the @entity115 – and after a dreadful injury - hit start to the campaign have started to creep up the @entity72 table			1
injuries are still interfering with his plans			0
@entity121 will not play against @entity1 after pulling a thigh muscle , 11 seconds into the game against @entity124 , last weekend			1
@entity125 and @entity126 are long - term injury absentees			0
the 3 - 2 win against @entity124 eased @entity2 up to seventh in the league , but defeat against @entity131 in @entity132 earlier this month means their place in the knock - out stages of the @entity30 is far from secure			1
@entity131 are at home to @entity136 of @entity137 on tuesday night			0
@entity121 , in action against @entity1 at @entity139 last november , will miss tuesday night 's game ' we won on saturday , we ’re playing at home and morale is good , ' said @entity9			1
' there are positives for us to tap into			0
but we ’re playing an unbeaten opponent and we have to give our best performance			0
they play very well as a team together , so we have to play at our maximum			0
' @entity151 pulled the trigger on @entity9 because of doubts about his tactical acumen and coaching experience at the very top level			1
@entity25 did not work out but with @entity32 back and @entity1 on top of the @entity160 it is a happy vibe at the club again			0
@entity9 may never persuade everyone that the 2012 @entity30 triumph was down to him			1
in fact , he does n’t try			0
@entity2 's 3 - 2 win against @entity124 eased @entity9 's side up to seventh in the @entity72 like others , he prefers to give credit to @entity1 ’s players for salvaging the tie against @entity171 , defying the odds to beat @entity173 despite playing more than half of the second leg of the tie in the @entity177 with 10 men and beating @entity48 in their own stadium			1
the final in the @entity110 will always be remembered for three penalty saves by @entity182 and @entity108 ’s header and winning spot kick , rather than any tactical brilliance by @entity9			2
but this may be unfair			0
he produced a balanced team from an imbalanced squad at @entity1 and , with four key players suspended in the final , organised his side well and produced a surprise by using @entity193 on the left wing to add stability			2
@entity151 pulled the trigger on @entity9 six months after @entity1 's @entity30 triumph he also showed an ability to manage the big egos , which has become a sizeable part of the job at the elite level			1
not everyone in @entity90 is convinced @entity9 is the man to revive this proud old club but he has a history of success as a player and a manager and an ability to influence the big occasions			2
it will not be wise to completely rule out the idea he will be the first to inflict defeat on @entity1 this season .			0
