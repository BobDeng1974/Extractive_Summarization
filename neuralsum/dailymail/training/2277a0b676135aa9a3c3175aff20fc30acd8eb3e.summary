eight months after he ordered the destruction of @entity3 's camp in @entity4 and a suspected chemical weapons facility in the @entity6 , president @entity0 doubted that the @entity8 leader posed a serious threat to the @entity10 , judging from a hand - written note mad public friday			1
the @entity12 released its latest trove of documents , including a hand - written note from the president to his national security adviser , @entity17 , on april 14 , 1999			1
@entity0 was reacting to a @entity19 story the day before that questioned whether @entity3 was behind a pair of august 7 , 1998 bombings of @entity10 embassies in @entity24 and @entity25			1
' @entity17 – if this article is right , ' he wrote to @entity27 , ' the @entity28 sure overstated its case to me – what are the facts ? ' in this april 14 , 1999 hand - written note to then - national security adviser @entity17 , president @entity0 questioned whether the @entity28 had oversold its intelligence showing the threat to the @entity10 that @entity8 leader @entity3 had become @entity0 ( @entity36 ) announced on 20 august 1998 during his @entity38 vacation that @entity10 forces had attacked terrorist bases in @entity4 and a suspected chemical weapons facility in @entity6			1
his note eight months later to national security adviser @entity17 ( r ) betrayed his lack of confidence about his decisions @entity3 , killed in a @entity47 raid in 2011 , was top - of - mind in 1998 when @entity0 bombed his terror training camps , but a year later the president questioned the @entity28 's intelligence @entity27 is now co-chair of @entity52 , a commercial consultancy he runs with @entity0 secretary of state @entity53 and @entity56 secretary of commerce @entity54			1
' intelligence on those responsible for the embassy bombings in @entity60 was continually developing , ' he told @entity61			1
' at the time of the attacks in @entity4 and @entity6 , we were confident that it was @entity8			1
' that position likely colored @entity27 's followup communications with his two @entity69 underlings most closely associated with @entity72 issues and transnational threats , @entity74 and @entity75			0
those conversations were redacted when the library released the documents on friday since they were classified			0
@entity74 and @entity75 could n't be reached for comment			0
reactions online and in print to the publication of @entity0 's 1999 note have generally been negative , focusing on @entity0 's indecisiveness in the face of a mortal enemy who would mastermind the deaths of thousands of @entity10 a few years later with the 9/11 attacks			2
' while @entity8 was planning the sept. 11 attacks , president @entity0 dashed off a note doubting that @entity3 was a major threat , ' author and @entity72 expert @entity89 told @entity61			1
@entity8 also bombed the @entity95 in october 2000 , killing 17 @entity10 sailors			2
@entity89 's 2004 best - seller ' losing @entity3 ' chronicles the @entity99 's earlier failures to corral the @entity3 , including its refusal of a back - channel offer from @entity6 intelligence to hand him over in 1996			2
@entity103 , then a junior @entity105 officer , was involved in those discussions			0
they culminated , @entity89 writes , with @entity6 's vice president asking a @entity10 intelligence official if the @entity10 wanted @entity3			2
it 's unclear if @entity0 himself was ever made aware of the overture			0
but @entity3 had publicly declared war on the @entity10 six times between 1995 and 1998 , making some of those declarations in public press conferences			2
two weeks after the august 1998 embassy bombings in @entity60 , the president green - lighted a series of cruise missile attacks against six terror camps in @entity4			1
he was at the time operating in @entity4 under the protection of the @entity123			0
in august 1998 a bomb blast at the @entity10 embassy in @entity126 , @entity24 ( @entity36 ) killed 213 people and injured more than 4,000			2
another blast occurred simultaneously at the @entity10 > embassy in @entity130 , @entity25 , leaving 11 dead and injuring 85 @entity131 : the october 12 , 2000 bombing of the destroyer @entity95 in the port of @entity135 in @entity136 killed 17 @entity10 sailors no wmds : @entity0 ordered a cruise missile attack on the al - shifa pharmaceutical plant in @entity141 , @entity6 , killing one worker ; his administration believed falsely that the facility was used to produce nerve gas for @entity8 @entity0 also ordered a missile attack on the @entity147 in @entity141 , @entity6			1
one worker died under the rubble			0
' today , we have struck back , ' @entity0 said that day			0
defense secretary @entity150 told reporters then that there would be ' no sanctuary for terrorists and no limit to our resolve to defend @entity10 citizens and our interests			0
' the @entity159 argued at the time that @entity8 was using the @entity147 factory to produce @entity162 nerve gas that its militants could use against @entity165 populations			0
@entity0 's spokespeople said the plant was heavily guarded , but that soil samples collected outside indicated the presence of @entity170 – short for o - ethylmethylphosphonothioic acid			2
that toxic chemical compound , @entity10 intelligence officials said then , was a nerve gas component that had no known commercial use			0
a @entity177 engineer who worked in the plant later told reporters that @entity170 was used at @entity147 , but to manufacture antibiotics and fungicides			0
and the administration later walked back claims from @entity150 , who had said after the factory was leveled that @entity3 had ' a financial interest in contributing to this particular facility			0
' the most damning criticism @entity0 received at the time came from dovish democrats in @entity190 , who suspected that he had ordered the attacks in @entity4 and @entity6 to draw attention away from his sex scandal that had monopolized newspaper headlines and news broadcasts			1
in @entity198 , the attacks were widely seen as a ' @entity200 ' episode , a name drawn from a popular movie about a political consultant who distracts voters from a sex scandal by hiring a @entity207 filmmaker to create and film a fake @entity10 war with @entity209			1
' @entity200 ' premiered just weeks before @entity0 's own sex scandal , about a @entity159 intern he had seduced , made international news			1
@entity214 ' sexual dalliance with @entity159 intern @entity215 became public in january 2008 , and by mid-year the @entity159 was eager to refocus the news media on other topics life imitates art ? @entity198 insiders believed the film ' @entity200 , ' about a political consultant hired to create a fake war to distract the public from a sex scandal , provided a template for @entity0 's cruise missile order , and his 1999 note to @entity27 suggests he was n't sure he did the right thing @entity0 's 1999 note to @entity27 indicates that he doubted the intelligence that preceded his cruise missile order			1
it may also lend credence to the ' @entity200 ' scenario , since it suggests that @entity0 ordered the cruise missile attacks despite lacking what he considered a complete intelligence assessment			1
a @entity10 intelligence source told @entity61 on friday that @entity0 ' certainly saw the @entity28 's evidence that @entity3 was behind the first @entity242 ' in 2001			1
' @entity0 saw everything they had , at least what they could prove , ' he said			0
the agency quickly established a section dedicated to finding the terror ringleader in 1996 , the same year mid-level talks with @entity6 fell through , once that information was deemed authentic			0
on june 8 , 1998 , two months before the embassy bombings , a federal grand jury issued a sealed criminal indictment against @entity3 and other terrorists including @entity256 , @entity8 's current leader			2
the indictment , which made national news , charged them with six crimes including ' conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against nationals of the @entity10			0

in a hand - written note to his national security adviser , @entity0 questioned in 1999 whether @entity3 was behind terror attacks against the @entity10
@entity17 , the adviser @entity0 wrote to , told @entity61 *exclusively* that ' we were confident that it was @entity8 '
a @entity19 reporter had concluded it was hard to prove , so @entity0 thought the @entity28 might have ' overstated its case ' to him
plenty of evidence already existed , which the @entity28 presented him in 1998 after @entity8 bombed two @entity10 embassies in @entity60
@entity0 himself ordered *retaliation* in @entity4 and @entity6 just weeks after those attacks – a move that some thought was *inspired* by the film ' @entity200 ' about a war created to distract @entity10 from a sex scandal
a best - selling author wrote that @entity6 had offered to hand over @entity3 to the @entity10 in 2006 , but @entity103 and others never closed the deal
