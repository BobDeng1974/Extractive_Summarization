when @entity1 scored against @entity2 after just one minute on sunday night , television cameras honed in on the @entity2 bench , where coach @entity4 had left almost £ 200million worth of his squad			1
@entity6 turned to @entity7 and said : ' you had better get warmed - up '			1
the star player 's joke at the expense of his manager was symptomatic of the chaos that currently reigns at @entity2			2
@entity4 is set to hold talks with president @entity15 on wednesday			2
@entity7 started @entity2 's defeat at @entity1 on the bench and has fallen out with @entity4 @entity7 shakes hand with opposing manager @entity19 after the final whistle in @entity21 total crisis ! the back page of @entity25 publication sport on tuesday - while it says @entity7 is ' p * * * * * off ' @entity4 is under pressure after leaving almost £ 200m worth of talent on the bench against @entity1 @entity4 is a club legend at @entity2 and a highly respected young coach , but after falling out with @entity7 there is usually only one direction for a manager at the @entity34			1
plus there 's his history at @entity37 ... playing career @entity39 : 1989 - 91 ( 36 apps 14 goals ) @entity37 : 1991 - 96 ( 157 apps 15 goals ) @entity2 : 1996 - 04 ( 207 apps 73 goals ) @entity45 : 1991 - 02 ( 62 apps 12 goals ) coaching career @entity48 : 2008 - 11 @entity49 : 2011 - 12 @entity50 : 2013 - 14 @entity2 : 2014 - club @entity51 @entity52 : 1994 – 95 , 1997 – 98 , 1998 – 99 @entity53 : 1992 – 93 , 1996 – 97 , 1997 – 98 @entity54 : 1993 , 1996 @entity55 : 1996 – 97 @entity56 : 1997 * apps and goals from league matches the manager will speak to the press at 1pm , with his boss holding a press conference separately in the @entity65 press room of the @entity34 at 4pm			1
@entity2 began 2015 in turmoil after the @entity67 upheld @entity69 's ban on them signing players for the next 12 months and are now in full - blown meltdown with @entity7 one of several senior players at loggerheads with @entity4 , who could be replaced as early as wednesday despite the board 's original intention to give him two games to save himself			1
the players ' biggest complaint towards the manager , who is yet to name an unchanged team this season , is that they do n't know where they stand with him			0
@entity7 , @entity6 and @entity86 were all given two extra days ' holiday over @entity88 only to then be told when they returned that they had not trained enough to play the first game of the year			1
@entity7 's desire to play in every match – something that @entity95 nearly always made sure he did – means he took the decision badly and failed to show for training on monday complaining of gastroenteritis			2
sick to the stomach of his manager would be another interpretation ; the two men are believed to have argued both during friday 's training session and on sunday in @entity21			0
monday 's session was open to the public with school children still on their @entity88 holidays allowed to watch their heroes train , but @entity7 was at home following @entity111 on @entity112 instead			2
he also follows @entity113 and @entity114 so it would be taking it too far to see such a move on social media as a ' come and get me ' message but the timing was telling all the same			0
as splash on their back page with ' @entity7 drives @entity2 to despair ' while @entity125 opt with ' @entity2 fall apart ' @entity7 is @entity2 's record goalscorer but has been linked with a summer switch to @entity111 @entity7 fuelled speculation he could be keen on a move to @entity111 by following the club 's @entity112 account january 8 : @entity131 ( h ) - @entity53 january 11 : @entity133 ( h ) - @entity52 january 15 : @entity131 ( a ) - @entity53 january 18 : @entity135 ( a ) - @entity52 january 24 : @entity131 ( a ) - @entity52 @entity111 fans hopeful he could end up at their club – he also followed @entity140 and @entity141 on @entity112 – should probably bear in mind that when @entity7 is unhappy at @entity2 it tends to be the people he is unhappy with that move on			1
@entity4 should be given this week 's cup game with @entity131 and sunday 's showdown with @entity148 ' @entity133 to save his job but @entity7 is by no means alone in being unhappy at the head coach			1
@entity152 , new signing @entity153 and @entity6 are others and , far from just being personal gripes , there are overriding concerns over the way the coach has the team playing			2
the manager who took over in the summer has a reputation for falling out with star players			0
he upset both @entity166 and @entity167 at @entity49 and , with sporting director @entity168 already fired and assistant @entity169 having quit soon after , the spotlight now falls on him			1
@entity4 has two games to save his job , the second of which against @entity148 ' @entity133 the club legend also fell out with players , notably @entity166 and @entity167 , at @entity49 @entity2 legend @entity169 has left the club , terminating his working contract on monday born on october 23 , 1961 in @entity176 , @entity45 joins @entity177 from @entity178 in 1981 make @entity45 debut in january 1985 joins @entity2 in 1986 having made 239 appearances for @entity177 joins @entity181 in 1994 having made 410 appearances for @entity2 retires in 1998 having made 126 appearances for @entity45 and a total of 833 club appearances for @entity177 , @entity2 and @entity181 honours : @entity52 : 1983 , 1984 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 @entity53 : 1984 , 1988 , 1990 @entity187 : 1992 @entity55 : 1989 @entity56 : 1992 @entity54 : 1984 , 1991 , 1992 post-retirement : @entity177 sporting director ( 2000 - 2010 ) @entity2 sporting director ( 2010 - 14 ) @entity169 joined @entity2 's academy at @entity192 in 1995 he played for @entity193 , before moving up to @entity48 in 1997 in 1998 , manager @entity194 agreed a deal with @entity196 to sell the defender			1
but @entity169 refused to move after seeing his best friend @entity198 make his first - team debut in october 1999 , @entity169 's persistence paid off as he made his first - team bow under @entity202 @entity169 was named club captain in the summer of 2004 after @entity4 - now head coach - retired on november 13 2010 , @entity169 made his 500th appearance in all competitions for @entity2 in march 2014 , @entity169 surpassed @entity207 to go second in @entity2 's all - time league appearance table , only behind @entity198 shortly after , he announced his retirement after struggling with injury , and on may 15 2014 , bid farewell to his playing career			1
he was then announced as @entity168 's assistant @entity214 @entity168 unveils @entity215 in august after he completed his £ 75million transfer from @entity217 @entity19 beat @entity7 's @entity2 on sunday night it was as if @entity19 had borrowed some of the magic of the @entity221 on sunday as @entity1 became giant - killers and took the scalp of @entity2			1
click here for the full report president @entity226 is also under pressure , not just to change the coach but to call elections			0
prospective rival candidate for the presidency @entity230 said on monday night on @entity25 radio : ' it 's clear that this board has weighed up the possibility of selling @entity7			2
' @entity230 , who received the second-most votes in the last election , was alluding to the theory that the current regime have deliberately antagonised the star in recent seasons , knowing how much selling the player would swell the coffers , but also being aware his departure would have to appear to be engineered by him and not them			0
former @entity2 striker @entity246 also waded in to criticise those in power at the club			2
he said : ' @entity226 understands basketball but not very much about football			0
he is not a president , he 's an administrator who has landed the job because the person in charge ( @entity253 ) was a bottler who ran away			0
' the outspoken former @entity2 dream team member also criticised the outgoing @entity168 saying : ' what signings have been made ? why did they not go for ( @entity259 ) @entity258 and @entity260 ? ' @entity215 has only scored one @entity52 goal but @entity246 has defended the former @entity217 striker many have criticised @entity2 for not attempting to sign @entity260 ( @entity264 ) and @entity258 ( r ) , who are now at @entity37 @entity2 are only a point behind @entity52 leaders @entity37 but severe problems lie off the field the pressure is on @entity2 president @entity226 ( left , posing with @entity6 as he signs in 2013 ) @entity2 will not be allowed to sign players in 2015 after the @entity67 upheld the @entity69 sanction imposed on the @entity273 club			1
the ban was imposed on @entity2 after they were deemed to have breached rules on signing international players under the age of 18			0
@entity2 were appealing the ban at @entity279 in @entity280 , @entity281 , in december but it was confirmed that it has been upheld and the @entity273 will also be fined 450,000 @entity282 ( £ 293,000 )			0
he also defended @entity215 saying : ' it 's not @entity215 's fault , he is a natural goalscorer and they are killing him			0
' the big summer signing from @entity217 has suffered in @entity4 's ever - changing line - ups and has so far scored only one league goal			2
@entity2 president @entity226 will publicly address supporters ' concerns on wednesday and announce a new sporting director with @entity294 's @entity293 an in - house option and @entity296 the leading candidates			1
@entity298 is a former @entity217 scout , who has also worked at @entity181 and @entity300 while @entity296 took over first team affairs when the late @entity302 fell ill. for the next 12 months whoever steps in will have very little to do in view of @entity2 's transfer ban			0
some of @entity168 's harshest critics have already questioned the timing of his dismissal			0
' for a club that ca n't sign players , he is the perfect @entity292 , ' said one , recalling the disastrous summer recruitments of @entity316 full - back @entity314 and former @entity318 defender @entity317 who have started one league game between them			0
@entity317 was brought in from @entity318 in the summer but has yet to play a game due to injuries			0
