by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:51 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:22 est , 18 december 2013 your @entity4 posts and the pages you like already give away a lot about you including what music you listen to , or your favourite restaurant			1
but now researchers are using people ’s @entity4 photos to identify what sub-culture they belong to , from goths and bikers to hipsters and surfers			1
they have created an algorithm that can identify certain elements associated with each of these groups , such as distinctive tattoos , hats and jewellery , before scanning other photos to find similar people			1
by scanning photos for elements commonly associated with certain sub-cultures , including bikers , hipsters , goths , and surfers , researchers could categorise @entity4 photos into each of these groups			1
the results could one day be used by advertisers to customise ads online researchers used a so - called ‘ multi-label classification algorithm ’			1
the algorithm scans photos that have already been tagged , and looks for identifying features			1
for example , if a picture is tagged as ‘ dog ’ , it will pick out the shapes and sizes of objects in the image			2
it will then scan other photos looking for similar features and elements that match , or closely resemble , the original dog			2
the software assumes that the new image contains similar elements as the original image and tags it with the same label			2
this is called a ‘ parts and attributes ’ approach			1
the @entity65 researchers used this model to scan photos of elements most commonly associated with different sub-cultures			1
it started by scanning the head , neck and arms for tattoos			0
it then checked for certain haircuts or jewellery , as well as the type of clothing and the colours the subjects wore			0
these results could then be used by advertisers and websites to customise the type of content these people see , or the products they ’re more likely to buy			1
to do this , researchers from the @entity65 used a so - called ‘ multi-label classification algorithm ’			1
it is already used by certain photo editing software , for example , to help tag and categorise images			0
the algorithm scans photos that have already been tagged , and looks for identifying features from each of these different groups			1
it started by scanning the head , neck and arms of the sample images for tattoos			0
it then checked for certain haircuts or jewellery , as well as the type of clothing and the colours the subjects wore , as well as poses			0
according to the algorithm , hipsters , for example , may wear glasses , have longer hair and beards			2
photos of @entity122 may predominantly feature the colour black and there may be tattoos or piercings			0
bikers are either stood near bikes , wearing bandanas or certain types of jackets or are in more urban environments			0
whereas surfers stand in more relaxed poses , for example , and wear shirts over t - shirts as well as caps			0
the software uses a ' multi-label classification ' algorithm that is often used in photo - editing programs to help tag and organise images			1
the green images pictured are those correctly identified as ( from top to bottom ) goths , formal and bikers			2
the elements in the red images do n't match these respective groups the software begins by scanning the head , neck and arms of the sample images for tattoos			2
it then checks for certain haircuts or jewellery , as well as the type of clothing and the colours the subjects are wearing , as well as their poses			0
according to the algorithm , hipsters , for example , may wear glasses , have longer hair and beards			2
photos of goths may predominantly feature the colour black and there may be tattoos or piercings			2
bikers are either stood near bikes , wearing bandanas or certain types of jackets , or are in more urban environments			0
surfers stand in more relaxed poses , for example , and wear shirts over t - shirts as well as caps			0
they also looked at identifying ‘ formal photos ’ by suits and long dresses , and the way groups of people pose in quite rigid , uniform stances			1
they also looked at identifying ‘ formal photos ’ by suits and long dresses , and the way groups of people pose in quite rigid , uniform stances			1
unfortunately , the researchers claim that the algorithm is only accurate in 48 per cent of cases and only correctly identified groups in 9 per cent			0
this means that it is unlikely to be used by websites any time soon without the software being enhanced			0
according to members of the @entity209 project : ' image sharing via social networks has produced exciting opportunities for the computer vision community in areas including face , text , product and scene recognition			0
' people can guess plenty of implicit information from the visual aspect of a group of people , but what can we automatically determine about the social subculture to which these people may belong ? ' we propose a framework that integrates state - of - the art person and face detection and uses low - and mid-level features to capture the visual attributes distinctive to a variety of social groups			0

the software uses what ’s called a ‘ multi-label classification algorithm ’
it identifies elements in @entity4 photos associated with select sub-cultures
these sub-cultures included bikers , goths , hipsters and surfers
the algorithm then scans other photos looking for these elements
websites and advertisers could use this information to customise what these people see online
