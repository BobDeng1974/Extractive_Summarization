sipping beer in a quaint brasserie , frolicking under the @entity3 and taking a sneaky peek at a painting of a naked woman , this is 1950 's @entity7 as seen through the lens of photographer @entity9			1
part of a new book celebrating the legendary photographer 's work , the photos offer a glimpse of a world where the ladies were glamorous and the cigarettes plentiful and nearly always @entity19			2
@entity9 , who died in 1994 , made his name in the 1930 's and specialised in roaming the streets of the @entity23 capital , @entity25 camera in hand , to capture intimate tableaux featuring the city 's residents			1
like his contemporary @entity48 , much of @entity9 's work focused on the ordinary and the mundane , although many of his photographs focus on @entity7 ' street children at play			1
their seemingly happy childhoods were a world away from his own , which came to an abrupt end at the age of four when his plumber father was killed on active duty during @entity61 i. brought up by his widowed mother until the age of seven , he then suffered a further tragedy when she died - leaving him to be brought up by an aunt variously described as ' unloving ' and ' cold '			0
favourite : @entity9 was particularly well known for his playful photographs of children , among them this shot taken beneath the @entity3 working girl : this beautifully composed shot taken in 1947 shows a woman enjoying the sunshine with a typewriter balanced on her knees despite his struggles at home , @entity9 proved an adept student , in particular in art and craft , and when he graduated in 1929 , got a job as a draughtsman in an advertising agency			0
the agency , @entity84 , also had a photography studio and @entity9 , who first got his hands on a camera aged 16 , was eventually able to switch jobs and become an assistant photographer			0
after a stint working as an assistant to modernist photographer @entity93 , @entity9 struck out on his own , selling his first photograph to @entity96 magazine in 1932			0
work as an industrial photographer for @entity99 followed , as did a brief period photographing for postcards			0
in 1939 came @entity9 's big break - a contract with photographic agency @entity103			0
when war broke out months later , he was drafted into the @entity23 army as both soldier and photographer and spent much of the following year taking pictures of soldiers			0
sneak peek : this knowing shot shows a gendarme ( policeman ) taking a sneaky look at a painting of a naked woman back for another look ! the gendarme was n't the only man to be caught enjoying a quick look at the naked lady by @entity9 and again ! this gentleman , wearing a neat black @entity122 , appears pleased to catch a glimpse of the painting ordinary : much of @entity9 's work focused on ordinary people going about their lives , such as this pair of women following the fall of @entity23 , he joined the @entity132 , using his draughtmanship and photography skills to create false passports for agents and those who needed to escape			1
despite his wartime heroics , @entity9 is most famous for his post-war career , in particular his 1950 's street scenes which focused on ordinary people going about their daily lives			1
@entity9 , who lived in the southern @entity7 suburb of @entity144 for most of his life , never stopped taking photos , although the rise of television in the 1970 's left him with fewer magazine clients and forced a move into celebrity portraits			2
nevertheless , despite the huge stars who sat for him in his studio , @entity9 , who died aged 81 in 1994 , never lost his passion for the @entity7 streets where his life as a photographer began			1
tough lesson : @entity9 caught this young child looking pained as he attempts to work out his sums in a class @entity163 : a woman looks out from the doorway of her home , peering sternly at @entity9 's camera @entity168 : another knowing photograph , this shows a man relaxing with a cigarette and a wall - full of pornographic photos			2
