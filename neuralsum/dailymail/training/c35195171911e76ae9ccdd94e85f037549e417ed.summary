mrs @entity7 owned the property , which was full of clothes and furniture , but lived across the road			1
det sgt @entity43 said : ' i saw an extraordinary amount of hoarding and rubbish			0
it would have made moving around the property very difficult and would have made what i would call normal living activity virtually impossible			0
' @entity7 's grandfather @entity52 , who was babysitting managed to escape but she was overcome by fumes and died of smoke inhalation @entity12 and @entity56 fire service investigator @entity55 said doors could not be closed because of clutter and that @entity7 ’s door could not be closed because of clothes , household goods and material in the way			1

' everyone did what they could but it all happened so quickly			0
we have been told that anyone who suffers smoke inhalation is not aware of it			1
it is very quick and very gentle and we take some small comfort in the fact that @entity7 will not have suffered			2
' mrs @entity7 said they will probably never know what sparked the fire which is thought to have started in the kitchen			2
