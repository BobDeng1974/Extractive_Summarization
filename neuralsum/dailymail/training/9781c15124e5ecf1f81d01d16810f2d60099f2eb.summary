by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 11:03 est , 10 august 2012 failing eyesight : dr @entity2 , 90 , drove the wrong way along the @entity4 and crashed into @entity6 's car , killing him a 90 - year - old driver with failing eyesight , who caused a fatal car crash with another car while driving on the wrong side of the road , was given a nine month suspended sentence today			1
retired doctor dr @entity2 took a wrong turn on the @entity4 between @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 , and ended up travelling south on the northbound carriageway			1
about a mile down the road , he smashed into @entity6 ’s @entity21 , killing him as his car collided with another vehicle and burst into flames			1
the day before the accident , @entity26 had visited a doctor who reported that @entity26 's eyesight was below the legal driving standard but did not tell him not to drive because he assumed @entity26 was not driving , @entity25 heard			1
horrified drivers told police how they had flashed their lights and hit their horns in an attempt to warn @entity26 as he drove his @entity37 at 60mph in the wrong overtaking lane on march 11 last year			1
mr @entity39 had just passed a car in the overtaking lane while another car in front of him moved into the inside lane when @entity26 ’s @entity37 came around a bend and the collision occurred			2
mr @entity39 ’s car then hit another a @entity48 convertible and burst into flames			0
he was killed instantly by the collision and not the flames , the court heard			0
@entity26 and his wife , who were on their way to the theatre in @entity17 from their then home in @entity59 , @entity18 , were also seriously injured and dragged from their smoking car by other motorists			2
one dead : dr @entity26 travelled south on the northbound carriageway for about a mile at 60mph before colliding with mr @entity6 's car ( left )			1
@entity26 's car is on the right killed : mr @entity6 died after @entity26 collided with his car on the way home from work the man , who had a clean driving licence , had also suffered a subdural haematoma he was unaware of before the accident and had been confused prior to the crash			1
the prosecution accepted this could have affected his judgment on whether he should drive			0
he had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at an earlier hearing			1
in mitigation @entity82 said : ‘ for a man who has dedicated his life to saving the lives of others , to be instrumental in the taking of one is a shattering blow for him			0
’ road markings unclear : prosecutor @entity92 told the court it was unclear how @entity26 made the wrong turn but said road markings were ' adequate but could have been better ' a third vehicle : after @entity26 hit mr @entity6 's car , it hit a silver @entity48 convertible ( right ) travelling in the same direction before it burst into flames @entity92 , prosecuting , said : ‘ it ’s not clear how the defendant came to be on the wrong side of the road as his recollection of what happened is hazy			1
’ the barrister explained the best possibility was that the doctor had turned the wrong way at what is known locally as the @entity115 junction onto the @entity4 where the road markings although ‘ adequate , could have been better ’			1
these road markings have since been improved , the court was told			2
mr @entity82 explained that on at least six other occasions , motorists had been confused by the road markings at the junction and had gone the wrong way - including in daylight - and that it was lucky no one else had been injured			1
he said : ‘ at first blush you think this is a case of an old man not paying attention but there is a fundamental problem here			0
’ should not have been driving : mr @entity6 's family , ( from left ) brother @entity135 , mother @entity132 and father @entity39 appeared outside court today			2
@entity132 said their son 's life had been ' cruelly robbed ' mr @entity82 said @entity26 , who had to be helped into the dock by his granddaughter and was using a zimmer frame , had found it difficult to come to terms with what he had done			2
he said : ‘ having spent all his life in the service of others , the last thing he wanted to do was a result such as this			0
’ confused prior to crash : @entity26 was unaware that he had suffered a subdural haematoma which caused him confusion before the accident even so , the court heard that @entity26 , now living in @entity159 , near @entity160 , ignored no entry signs , road markings and the flashing lights of other motorists and drove for more than a minute on the wrong side of the road			1
judge @entity167 suspended the sentence for two years and disqualified @entity26 from driving for life			2
he said that @entity26 ’s eyesight was very worrying and added that if there was a message to come out the tragedy it was that doctors and relatives ‘ look very , very carefully whether elderly people can drive ’			0
speaking outside court , mr @entity39 ’s mother @entity132 said that the doctor should not have been behind the wheel			0
she said : ‘ when a driver reaches 70 all that he or she has to do is complete a form to say that they are medically fit and a driving licence is issued for another three years			0
‘ though i acknowledge that there are many safe elderly drivers on our roads there are some who are not , and families are sometimes too afraid to confront their elderly relatives as to their failing abilities			0
‘ through this lack of foresight my son , who had a wealth of friends and family who loved him dearly , and who had just started a new job with such high hopes and plans for the future , has been so cruelly robbed			0
’ @entity26 moved to @entity206 to be near his wife , who has dementia and he visits her every day			0
