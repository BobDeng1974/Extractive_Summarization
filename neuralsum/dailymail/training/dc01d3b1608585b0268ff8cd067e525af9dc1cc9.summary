by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 22 january 2013 an artist has transformed discarded @entity3 trees into green ' monsters ' by adding googly eyes and facial expressions			1
@entity7 was shocked at the number of festive trees that had been thrown out after the festive period so decided to give them a new lease of life			1
he hung a pair of white baubles with hand - painted eyes on at the top of the trees and used a piece of tinsel for a smile or frown			1
unloved : artist @entity7 gave @entity24 's discarded @entity3 trees their own personalities he made some look like they are staring at each other or at passersby while others look happy and sad			1
one dead tree was even given ' crossed out ' eyes			0
some of the wacky creations resemble @entity34 from children 's tv show @entity35			0
they are now providing great amusement of the people of @entity24			2
@entity7 , 35 , said : ' every year i 've always noticed the huge number of trees that are thrown out after @entity3			2
' while i appreciate these cut down trees are generally replaced by seeds or saplings , there 's something incredibly wasteful about them just being thrown out			0
' so the idea sprung to mind that i could recycle them , give them a second life and hopefully get people to associate to them differently			0
white baubles were used to create eyes for the trees which were found discarded around @entity24 ' wasteful ' : @entity7 said he wanted to recycle the @entity3 trees to create amusement and enjoyment for passersby grouch : inspiration for this binned tree was @entity35 's character @entity34 ( pictured right ) ' part of the rule on how i work is the trees have to be found , they ca n't be staged , and it has to be how they have been thrown out and found			1
' they say " eyes are the window to the soul " and it 's pretty easy to give any inanimate object emotions with a pair of eyes			2
' as an added expression on some of the trees i included a piece of tinsel to create a mouth , frown or smile			0
' people have loved them			0
the response is generally one of amusement and enjoyment			0
' dumped : @entity7 set himself a rule that only trees he came across by chance would be decorated with bauble eyes this brown tree was given crossed out eyes because it was already dead when found by @entity7			1

artist @entity7 used bauble ' eyes ' to give discarded trees personality
decorated trees *spotted* around @entity24 also feature tinsel ' frowns '
