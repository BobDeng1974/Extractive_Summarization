decision : health minister @entity5 revealed that the government now has no intention of changing either the law or guidelines on counselling ¿ despite previous promises to consult on the issue @entity24 mp @entity23 said it was ‘ bizarre ’ to scrap a consultation on plans to prevent clinics , such as those run by @entity30 and the @entity31 , from offering counselling to women at the same time as carrying out terminations			1
