by @entity0 @entity1 , a keen footy player , was diagnosed with the rare tumour just days before he was due to fly out to @entity3 with his family a @entity6 family has described the incredibly cruel impact cancer has had on their life following the double diagnosis of a father and son just eight months apart			1
in a heart - wrenching interview aired on @entity19 's 60 minutes program , the @entity15 family revealed the devastating moment cancer took hold of the youngest boy , 11 - year - old @entity1 , before illness also struck his 44 - year - old father @entity23 just eight months after			1
the avalanche of bad news began to tumble downhill after @entity1 's diagnosis in november , just days before the family were due to fly out on a dream holiday to @entity3			1
@entity1 's parents took the keen footy player to hospital when they noticed his stomach began to swell significantly			0
' my mum thought that something was wrong but @entity37 's like ' you â€™re probably eating too much @entity38 , ' @entity1 said			0
it turned out his diet had nothing to do with his stomach 's ballooning growth , but everything to do with the football - sized tumour hiding inside			1
' i think our life prior to this was a very average suburban day - to - day life			2
. very solid and happy , ' mother @entity49 said			0
@entity1 , then @entity15 was told he too had a cancer in a cruel blow to the family which were still dealing with the news of the 11 - year - old 's diagnosis his father had joked he 'd been eating too much fast food - but doctors discovered a football - sized tumour ( right ) when @entity1 was taken to hospital the grey matter below the doctor @entity64 's finger show the extent of the foot - ball sized tumor which was too big to be cut from @entity1 's stomach ' now i feel like we have the same life but instead of living on solid ground we are on the edge of a precipice			1
' it meant @entity1 's long - awaited trip of a lifetime to visit @entity3 was put on hold indefinitely			2
the news - enough to reduce his parents to tears			2
' you talk about going from the penthouse to the basement , ' mr @entity15 said			0
' for an 11 - year - old kid to think he is about to get on a plane to @entity3 and then get told he 's got cancer the next day , is just mind boggling			1
' @entity1 's mother and father both broke down during the heartfelt interview with @entity91 who is a close friend of the pair and the godfather of the 11 - year - old despite the intensity of the situation , @entity96 remained incredibly upbeat during the interview			1
at times , the 11 - year - old was joking with interviewer @entity91 saying the reason behind his ballooning stomach was his poor diet the mind - boggling news was made worse after hearing that doctors were unable to operate on the tumour			1
too big , the family knew despite hoping otherwise , that @entity1 's cancer was serious			1
' all i remember him saying to me is , ' am i going to die ? ' mr @entity15 said			0
' that took all i had to say ' mate of course you 're not going to die ' and not cry myself			0
' knowing chemotherapy , radiation and surgery would n't work , there was only one hope of bringing the watermelon - sized growth to it 's knees and that was a shot of a therapy drug called @entity123			1
the untested drug which had only been trialed in a small sample of pediatric cases and adults with lung cancer , had amazing results			1
@entity1 had four ct scans , the last of which showed remarkable trials that a drug had removed a large portion of the cancer in his stomach @entity1 , the youngest in the family , is pictured with sister @entity138 months on and four ct scans later the doctors at @entity140 revealed the remarkable change in @entity1 's condition			1
oncologist dr @entity64 said the the tumour 's reduction in size was ' almost a miracle			1
' ' but it is also important to be optimistic on the one hand and realistic on the other			0
' meanwhile as @entity1 's condition started to improve , his father received the gut wrenching news that a cancer had begun to grown inside his own body just eight months after @entity1 's diagnosis			1
' i found out last thursday			0
i 've got prostate cancer , ' mr @entity15 said			1
' the way i look at it is , @entity1 's got a tumor that is sort of a one in a million tumor			0
' when the prostate cancer was diagnosed it was kind of like we 've already had the shark attack this is just a mozzy bite			1
' when the family found out about @entity1 's condition , @entity15 sent a text message to family and friends telling them of @entity1 's diagnosis			2
he told 60 minutes he could n't believe what he was writing in the message was true			0
the size of the cancer , in red , was as big as a football when it was at full maturity inside @entity1 's stomach but months of target treatment using the the trial of a cancer therapy drug reduced it to the size of a golf ball			1
' it is almost a miracle			0
' it 's almost a miracle ' oncologist dr @entity64 said			0
nonetheless , mr @entity15 admitted it was still incredibly tough news to take			0
' how do the two boys in the family get cancer at the same time ? , he said			2
' it 's just ridiculous			0
' knowing his family were n't the only ones with a young child battling cancer , mr @entity15 said they also wo n't be the last			2
' you ca n't sit back and think do n't worry about it it 's not our caper ... that wo n't happen			0
' well , it 's happened to us			0
' he said he wanted people to pledge their support to the annual @entity211 fundraising event for @entity212 in @entity140			0
it raises funds to buy life - saving equipment , fund research and deliver vital services to help young patients			2
' that 's probably the only reason we told this story			2
these kids are just plain unlucky , they 've done absolutely nothing ... there 's nothing but bad luck involved and we need to save these kids it 's as simple as that			0

@entity96 , 11 , was diagnosed with a rare cancer in november
doctors *prescribed* a new drug to treat the *inoperable* tumour
the ' miracle ' drug reduced cancer from ' rugby *league* ball ' to ' golf - ball size '
but eight months later father , 44 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer
family want their story told to raise funds and help fight childhood cancer
