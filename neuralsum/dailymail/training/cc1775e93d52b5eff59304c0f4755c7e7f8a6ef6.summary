@entity1 's last - minute goal earned 10 - man @entity2 a 2 - 1 victory over @entity5 at @entity6 in a @entity8 contest that was laced with controversy			1
@entity2 captain @entity10 was sent off in a bad - tempered affair which was preceded by a disrupted @entity13 silence			1

@entity1 celebrates after his last - minute goal earned @entity2 a 2 - 1 win against @entity5 the @entity2 defender was left unmarked to tap home from @entity25 's cross @entity25 capitalised on some hesitancy between @entity5 goalkeeper @entity10 and defender @entity27 to slide home 11 minutes later			1
@entity28 came close on numerous occasions after the break - including a shot against the post - and he drew the foul that earned @entity10 a second booking with nine minutes left			0
but van @entity1 stunned most of the 19,051 crowd when he tapped home from two yards after the home defence had allowed @entity25 's corner to travel all the way to the back post			2
the build - up to the game was dominated by the ongoing row surrounding @entity44 's seven - match ban for using offensive language of a ' racist nature ' towards @entity5 full - back @entity47			2
@entity2 submitted their appeal on wednesday and manager @entity50 and skipper @entity10 upset @entity5 boss @entity51 with the strength of their proclamations protesting @entity44 's innocence			1
@entity5 's @entity14 opened the scoring with a close range finish @entity5 teammates pounce on @entity58 to celebrate taking the lead @entity44 was left out of the @entity2 squad though and the issue then proved peripheral until the second half , when @entity47 was playing on the side of the stadium holding the @entity2 fans , who jeered him when he got the ball			1
the home fans responded with their vocal backing , just as they had sung his name before the game , moments before the scheduled minute 's silence			1
there was not even a second of silence though as some @entity2 fans shouted and sang , both inside and outside @entity6 , while others tried to shout them down			1
the controversy continued into the game with a major flashpoint after two minutes			0
@entity10 appeared to push @entity82 over on the threshold of the box as he chased the @entity5 midfielder but referee @entity86 waved play on			2
@entity25 takes advantage of @entity5 keeper @entity10 's hesitation to net the equaliser @entity25 ( @entity90 ) retrieves the ball and is chased by teammates after bringing @entity2 level @entity5 lost @entity94 to a hamstring injury inside nine minutes with @entity96 coming on			1
@entity2 had made five changes with @entity98 among those coming in for his first appearance for almost two months following a hamstring injury			0
there were nearly 20 minutes gone before either side had a meaningful effort , @entity106 steering a first - time effort just past the far post following a sharp passing move			0
the lack of goalmouth action continued until @entity17 failed to claim @entity113 's long throw under pressure from @entity58 inside his six - yard box			0
the ball was only half - cleared to @entity113 who drove it towards goal			0
@entity17 got down to stop it but could not hold and @entity58 was on hand to force the rebound inside the post despite attempts to stop him from the @entity125 and several defenders			0
@entity2 captain @entity10 ( @entity127 ) is sent off after receiving a second caution for a tackle on @entity28 @entity130 had a header saved and @entity2 levelled after @entity133 's halfway - line challenge on @entity28 sparked a quick break			1
@entity106 slipped a pass through to @entity25 and the @entity136 slid to reach the ball and wrapped his foot around it to flick it into the net despite @entity27 and his goalkeeper appearing to have the situation under control			0
the @entity136 almost emulated his midweek long - range strike in @entity147 moments later but @entity10 got down well to stop his powerful first - time effort from 25 yards			0
the @entity5 goalkeeper stopped a shot from his namesake early in the second half and @entity28 three times came close for the hosts , shooting inches over from 25 yards before hitting the outside of the post from closer in and then heading wide from 12 yards			0
@entity2 fans were in full voice throughout the game , although some disrupted the minute 's silence at the start @entity130 wheels away to celebrate his late winner at @entity6 the game grew increasingly hostile			1
@entity106 received a yellow card following an exchange with the home support after he kicked the ball into the crowd , @entity166 and @entity167 were booked after the @entity2 left - back reacted angrily to a challenge , and @entity2 's @entity10 was cautioned for the latest in a series of fouls on @entity82			1
@entity47 almost helped silence the visiting crowd when he helped set up @entity178 via @entity28 but @entity17 stopped the midfielder 's header			0
@entity10 got his second yellow card for taking down @entity28 , who curled the resulting free - kick just over			0
