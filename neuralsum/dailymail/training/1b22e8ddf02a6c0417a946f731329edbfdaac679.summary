if you are struggling to stick to a diet of carrot sticks and lettuce leaves , news of the latest weight loss technique to be sweeping @entity6 could be music to your ears			0
former actor , @entity9 , claims to have lost two stone and five inches from his waist in seven weeks by following his @entity12			1
mr @entity9 , 55 , claims that followers of the diet just have to spend two minutes a day concentrating on taking long breaths and then exhaling aggressively			1
while he was practicing the breathing techniques , mr @entity9 noticed that he was losing weight			1
as a result of the discovery , he drew up the @entity12 which involves the dieter taking a specific position before inhaling for three seconds and then exhaling powerfully for seven seconds			1
mr @entity9 claims that people who practice this breathing technique for two to five minutes a day will see rapid benefits			1
@entity18 reports that there are two ways of practicing the diet			0
the first involves tensing the buttocks while standing with one foot in front of the body and placing most of the body ’s weight on the back foot			1
mr @entity9 claims that followers of the diet just have to spend two minutes a day concentrating on taking long breaths and then exhaling aggressively in this position , the dieter is encouraged to inhale for three seconds while lifting their arms above their head			1
they are then told to breathe out while tensing all of their muscles for seven seconds			0
the second way of practicing the technique involves the dieter standing upright while tightening their buttocks and placing one hand on their stomach , and the other on the bottom of their back			1
they are then told to inhale for three seconds before breathing out for seven seconds , all of the time holding in their stomach			2
@entity64 , creator of the @entity65 , another weight loss programme based on breathing , told @entity18 : ‘ @entity68 is made up of oxygen , carbon , and hydrogen			2
when the oxygen we breathe reaches these fat molecules , it breaks them down into carbon dioxide and water			0
‘ the blood then picks up the carbon dioxide – a waste product of our bodies – and returns it to the lungs to be exhaled			0
therefore the more oxygen our bodies use , the more fat we will burn			0
’ the @entity12 is believed to increase a dieter ’s muscle strength and to boost their metabolism by increasing their blood oxygen levels			1
however , most experts believe that practicing it for just two minutes a day is not sufficient to see any significant weight loss			2
@entity92 , chief physiologist at the @entity93 , says the effectiveness of the technique is highly doubtful			0
he said : ' medium to high intensity work out - such as rowing , brisk walking , or running - over a long period is the only way to burn up fat and elevate metabolism			2
' deep breathing and gentle exercises for five minutes a day is not going to burn up enough calories to transform body shape			1
' the @entity12 involves the dieter taking a specific position before inhaling for three seconds and then exhaling powerfully for seven seconds in fact , professor @entity110 , professor of metabolic physiology at the @entity111 in @entity112 , warns breathing too deeply can do more harm than good			1
' inhaling and exhaling too deeply can disturb the balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body needed to neutralise the blood			2
this can cause light headedness and even make someone faint			0
' and , he doubts simply breathing will turn fat into fuel			0
' contraction of muscles caused by exercise mobilises fat stores			0
but it is only vigorous aerobic sport that triggers enough energy to turn fat into fuel			0
deep breathing alone will burn up fat by two per cent at best			0

@entity9 says he lost two stone in seven weeks on the @entity12
says he found it by mistake while doing breathing exercises for his back pain
it involves spending two minutes a day concentrating on taking long breaths before exhaling aggressively
