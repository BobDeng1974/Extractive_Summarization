by @entity0 vegans and those suffering from lactose intolerance could soon be eating ' cheese ' grown in a lab , made using yeast , vegetable butter and water			1
biohackers in @entity9 have found a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow dna , before growing them in baker ’s yeast and using them to create a ‘ milk ’ substitute			1
this milk can then be churned using traditional cheese - making methods to become real vegan cheese			1
they create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow dna , before growing them in baker 's yeast and using them to create a ' milk '			1
this can then be churned using traditional cheese - making methods ‘ we live in an unsustainable world			1
the cheese we eat today is produced by commercial dairy cows which , though they produce delicious milk and cheese , have an exceptionally large carbon footprint , ’ explained the biohackers from @entity25 and @entity26			2
the process begins by taking genetic sequences inspired by cow dna , and creating cheese protein genes that function in yeast			1
to create the proteins , the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk - protein genetic sequences			2
they optimised the genes for use in yeast , and created the resulting yeast milk protein dna from scratch			2
this dna is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk - protein			1
the genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows			2
the raw cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast			1
to make real vegan cheese , the researchers then take the cheese protein and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients , including , fat , or in this case vegetable butter , vegan sugar in place of lactose , and water			1
mixing these creates the vegan milk , which can then be then turned into cheese			2
‘ by creating an alternative pathway to cheese , we help the environment , increase access to tasty and healthy food			0

the team , from @entity148 , @entity149 , said the product is not only artificial , but also free of lactose and cholesterol			0
manufacturing process is set to begin this year , and the final product should be ready by july 2015			0
ultimately the team hopes to bring their artificial milk to mark in three years			0
this means none of the genes have ever been part of an animal , making them truly vegan			0
‘ we believe that using animals as large - scale food production machines is ethically and environmentally irresponsible			0
’ ‘ [ but ] all humans , vegans included , should have access to delicious and healthy cheese			0
‘ as with all scientific research , we ca n’t be completely certain this will work until we try it			0
' but we ’re confident we will be able to make vegan cheese protein and turn it into the world ’s first real vegan cheese			1
’ they also claim the cheese would be healthier			0
for example , for each of the four main proteins found in cheese , there are genetic variants found in humans and in different breeds of cows			0
although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals , they are actually made from scratch ( pictured left )			0
the biohackers have already raised more than $ 15,605 ( £ 9,100 ) on @entity192 and the next step is to turn the milk into cheese			1

for each of the four main proteins found in cheese ( stock image pictured ) there are genetic variants			0
some increase the risks of allergic response			0
as a result , the biohackers claim they can select the most desirable variants of these naturally occurring proteins some of these versions of the proteins are associated with various health benefits , or increased risks of allergic response			0

real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from @entity9
they create cheese protein genes from sequences based on cow dna
these genes are grown in baker ’s yeast before being extracted
they are then mixed with vegetable butter , vegan sugar and water
in theory , this ‘ milk ’ can then be churned using cheese - making methods
