by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:00 am on 23rd january 2012 a mother and her newborn baby died from the same easily treatable infection because of blunders by busy midwives			1
@entity7 , 33 , developed septic shock four days after the birth of son @entity10 , who was born 15 weeks premature			1
he died from the same infection just a few days later			1
the family 's grief was compounded even further when ms @entity7 's father @entity15 was arrested on suspicion of her murder			1
he spent the night of her death in a police cell			2
tragic : @entity19 died after midwives failed to spot a treatable infection ' it turns my stomach upside down when i think about what happened			2
it makes me feel sick , ' he said			0
' the officers said there was nothing to worry about and they just wanted to ask a few questions but then they handcuffed me			0
i was treated like a criminal when i 'd done nothing wrong			0
' officers later realised he had nothing to do with his daughter 's death and no further action was taken against him			2
mr @entity19 , who works as a carpet fitter , claims he has never received an apology			0
an inquest into ms @entity7 's death heard how she was admitted to the labour ward at @entity45 's @entity44 in the early hours of april 20 last year			1
she gave birth to @entity10 but subsequently felt unwell			1
the coroner was told that on there separate occasions staff ignored waning signs of a serious infection			2
ms @entity7 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , was also left for hours without regular check - ups			1
she was discharged from hospital on the same day she gave birth			2
but her condition rapidly worsened and four days later she collapsed at her father 's house			2
she was taken to hospital but it was too late to treat her			0
she died of septic shock and streptococcal infection			1
ms @entity7 was also mother to @entity64 , nine , and @entity65 , eight			1
their father @entity66 said : ' telling the kids about what happened to @entity7 was the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life			1
' they wanted to know where their mummy was			0
they really want to see her again			0
' ' @entity7 was a good person and we all miss her			2
' @entity45 coroner @entity79 said : ' the severity of @entity7 's condition went unrecognised			1
' had @entity7 been recalled to hospital she would have been treated with antibiotics which would have covered this infection and @entity7 would have survived			1
' victim : mother @entity7 , seen here shortly after the birth of her daughter @entity64 died from the same infection			1
an inquest heard a simple dose of antibiotics would have prevented the 33 - year - old 's death she recorded a narrative verdict on @entity7 with neglect as a contributing factor			1
at the inquest , midwife @entity96 admitted she missed out @entity97 during a busy ward round because she was ' distracted ' by other patients			0
she said : ' i was looking after quite a lot of ladies			0
probably about eight of them			0
' my intention was to re-check @entity7 every four hours but i was very busy			2
it was a very demanding shift			0
' in hindsight i would have done things differently			0
' @entity108 , the hospital 's head of midwifery , said @entity7 's death was caused by ' human error ' but insisted there were enough staff to cope with the number of patients			1
test results which revealed @entity7 had an infection had been relayed over the phone to someone on the ward two days before her death - but no - one remembered taking the call			1
the hospital 's consultant obstetrician , professor @entity125 , said : ' the microbiology lab tried to ring the result through to the labour ward			2
' our telephone records show the lab called the ward and spoke to someone for five minutes			0
we do n't know who answered the call and no action was taken			0
' whoever had taken that call should have informed the senior midwife and on - call doctors to find out where the patient was and take action			0
; ordeal : @entity145 had to deal with being arrested and quizzed by police who initially thought @entity7 's death might have been suspicious prof @entity125 added that ' significant ' changes have been put in place to educate midwives on rules and standards of care with posters and mandatory training programmes			1
she said : ' there were a series of errors and we are making sure these individual errors never happen again			0
' @entity7 's father , @entity145 , told how he found his daughter lying in the hallway complaining of numb legs on the day she died			1
he said : ' she started going into shock so i called the ambulance - i was panicking because i could see she was in distress			2
her health went downhill so quickly			0
' @entity171 , chief medical officer at @entity44 , said : ' all staff involved in @entity7 's care were shocked and saddened by her sudden death and i would like to extend my sincere sympathies to her family for their loss			1
' ' following @entity7 's death , we acted immediately to ensure that we have learnt lessons from this tragedy and all midwives have intensive sepsis awareness training to enable them to respond appropriately to the early signs and symptoms of this condition			1
' additionally , all high risk maternity patients are routinely observed using an early warning system which alerts staff to subtle signs of deterioration			0
' staff have been deeply affected by this tragedy and have worked hard to ensure that we improve the systems in place for vulnerable women			0
' we are a busy unit delivering more than 6,000 babies a year with mothers with increasingly complex medical issues			0
' our track record in caring for both mothers and babies is exceptional and events such as this while tragic are exceedingly rare			0
