feeders and fetishes - the perils of online dating as a plus size lady taking the plunge and signing up to a dating website can be one of the most daunting acts in a single person 's life			1
but for single mother @entity13 , the experience has almost put her off completely - because as a size 24 , her figure has either deterred the right type of man , or attracted the wrong kind			1
the 38 - year - old from @entity19 has been approached by feeders , dominatrix - lovers and even men who are turned on by toilet habits			1
@entity13 , 38 , had stopped dating online after regularly being told she 's too overweight by dates but while the stories have provided her friends with a constant stream of hilarious stories , it has ended up with the former beauty queen eventually dropping her search for a new partner completely			1
@entity13 , who works as a self - employed recruiter , first subscribed to online dating with the website @entity36 in march of this year			1
she said : ' i think because i had heard success stories from other people who had tried online dating that i thought i would give it a try , as i had nothing to lose			2
' with work and being a single mum i am very busy and going out is not a luxury that you always have the option of			2
verity at the @entity51 beauty pageant in 2013 , where she won the crown ' i was very honest about my size as i always have been , i have also lost a bit of weight in the last year , going from a size 30 to a size 24			2
' so i thought , ok , i know big ladies are n’t a lot of people ’s cup of tea but i feel very comfortable with myself and let ’s give it a go			0
' within the first 24 hours , @entity49 realised that online dating as a larger woman meant she attracted some very odd characters			1
she said : ' i got quite a lot of interest , but once you start messaging , i realised that the majority of men just wanted a hook - up - they just wanted sex			2
' literally , within an hour of messaging they start asking what your favourite sexual position is , which is a bit disheartening			1
' also there were a huge amount of married men on there			2
in the past six months , @entity49 has been attracted by several strange men with fetishes on dating websites because of her weight ' i had a guy who asked me if i wanted a cuckold relationship , which is when a man likes to watch his partner with other men			1
' i also had someone ask me if i was interested in being his dominatrix			0
' nobody took it seriously , i even had one man who was a lorry driver who messaging me at 9pm at night , saying , " i ’m in @entity19			1
" ' so i called his bluff and said , " oh yeah , shall i come and meet you now ? " and he was like , " yeah , " i said , " get lost , it ’s not a hook up site			0
" ' you start to think , ‘ ok , i ’ve had enough of this , i ’ve had enough of the sex requests , ’ because you feel like no one is taking you seriously			0
' after becoming frustrated with her lack of success , @entity49 left @entity36 and signed up to @entity113			0
@entity49 never hid her size on dating websites , always stating that she is size 24 , but men were still surprised at her body when they met up in person but even more disappointing than the men with odd tastes and behaviour , were those who refused a second date because she was too big - even though she had made her size very clear			1
she said : ' it was at @entity36 when it started that i was told , i think you ’re very beautiful and funny , you ’re very witty and intelligent but you ’re just a bit too big , you ’re not a size 12			2
' but then i moved to @entity113 and it just got worse			0
' i think it was because i made a point of saying , ‘ you do know i ’m a size 24 ? ’ but people say , " well you do n’t look that big in your pictures , " so that ’s a bit disheartening			2
' i have had a few nice dates , but it never gets past the first one			0
' i genuinely feel it ’s because of my weight - men do not like fat women			1
' he ’ll say , ‘ you ’re really lovely but you ’re too big , ’ i ’m not hiding my size before the date at all though , so it is really frustrating			2
' as a last resort , she signed up to a plus size dating website , but that brought with it a whole new range of strange men who were specifically attracted to larger women and a size 24 , @entity49 found she was almost too small for many			1
@entity49 believes that our society will never be able to stop judging overweight people she said : ' i do understand that although i am large myself , i would n’t necessarily want to go out with a man who was really , really obese , so i can understand where some guys are coming from			0
' but then when i went on the plus size dating website , i ’m not big enough for some of these people - they ’d say things like , ‘ do n’t go losing any more weight			1
’ ' then there was this guy who was a feeder , he did n’t use that term , but he would ask me things like what i had eaten that day and if i was hungry , it was just weird			0
there was also a man who started talking to me quite explicitly and wanted to watch me poo			0
i was like , what ? ! ' and then there were lots of @entity186 men , which is all very flattering when you have lots of @entity186 men interested , but they are about eight or nine hours away			2
although she had no luck on the online dating front in @entity193 , @entity49 attracted several admirers from @entity186 ' although i appreciate that people do have long distance relationships , that is just too far			1
' last year , @entity49 won the @entity199 beauty pageant , so says she has had buckets of confidence about her appearance , but she says her online dating experience has really knocked her confidence			0
she has now sworn off these websites until she has lost weight , because she ca n't face any more rejection based on her size			0
@entity49 is now attempting to lose more weight so that men can finally see past her figure to the personality underneath she said : ' i ’ve got to the point where i do n’t know if i can be bothered , i am not even considering dating now until i have lost some weight because i ’m fed up of hearing that i ’m not good enough			1
a lot of people turn around and say that i ’m lovely and really funny , etc , but unfortunately it ’s not enough			0
' i ’d love to have a relationship , but unfortunately my weight is putting men off			1
' i think to myself that i have won a plus size beauty competition , so i ca n’t be that bad			0
' also , i was married until we got divorced seven years ago and i was in another relationship until january of this year , so i know that some men can see past the weight			1
' unfortunately , as a society we ’re always going to have this perception of fat people at the end of the day			0
' people will always think that if you ’re fat then you ’re lazy , you sit around all day and eat cake and do n’t work			0
' well i ’m quite the opposite , but as an individual , if i want to have a relationship it 's clear that i have to lose weight because that ’s what is putting men off			1
' i know there are some men out there who do n’t mind big women , but my experiences since spring onwards have been extremely negative			0
' you need to look at the bigger picture and the person inside			0
' have you had a similar experience ? email us your story @entity253			0
