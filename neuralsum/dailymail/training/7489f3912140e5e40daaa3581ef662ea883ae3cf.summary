by @entity0 published : 13:09 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 05:06 est , 4 october 2013 an investigation has been launched after £ 2million of taxpayers ' cash was wasted on @entity5 ' memorabilia that was worth just £ 300,000			2
a publicly funded travel firm in @entity7 handed over the huge sum for a pair of @entity11 's glasses and @entity13 's first guitar , plus nine other items in 2008			1
despite concerns over the valuation at the time , the board of @entity16 agreed to the payment as part of a deal to buy the city 's @entity5 ' story museum from a group of @entity26 - based investors for £ 8million			1
the collection , bought by publicly - funded mersey - travel in 2008 , includes these wire glasses worn by @entity11 during the recording of @entity31 and the guitar @entity13 learned to play on but - following an internal audit - it has since emerged that the memorabilia was , in fact , worth £ 1.7million less			1
the wire - rimmed glasses , which were apparently worn by @entity11 when he wrote his most famous song , imagine , in 1970 , were valued as being worth £ 1million alone			1
@entity13 's guitar , a brown six - string acoustic , which he learned to play on , was priced at £ 500,000			1
other items in the @entity43 cache of memorabilia included studio notes written by their producer @entity46 , believed to relate to the recording of @entity48 , from the @entity50 album			1
it is understood lawyers instructed at the time of the sale had warned of a potential ' conflict of interest ' because the valuation had been made by a business partner of the person who wanted to sell the memorabilia			1
however , such information was not passed on to councillors sitting on the board of @entity16 and instead staff told the lawyers to proceed with the purchase			2
official documents state that ' both issues represent a serious failure in corporate governance '			0
former @entity69 managing director @entity68 said : ' there did not seem to be any discomfort from the @entity16 lawyers at the time			1
' this guitar and the spectacles alone were said to be worth £ 1.5million but the whole collection has now be revalued at just £ 300,000 auditors for @entity16 have since recommended ' a full investigation into the @entity5 memorabilia valuation ' and advised the authority to take ' appropriate action			2
' @entity16 chairman @entity83 @entity82 said : ' we will look to take action if we establish that we were let down by those we were relying on at the time and that the interests of the taxpayer were not well served in the original negotiation			2
' from initial enquiries it does appear that elements of due process were not followed			0
this could not happen now			0
our new governance and scrutiny processes would not allow it			0
' it is a reflection of where @entity16 was and not where it is now			0
' @entity102 added : ' it is important to note that @entity104 is unaffected by this revaluation			0
it remains a profitable , first - class visitor attraction			0
it has had a bumper summer with visitor numbers up 8 per cent on last year			0
' @entity16 is publicly funded via grants from central government , the five local authorities in @entity114 and @entity116 funding			0
@entity104 opened in @entity7 's @entity117 in 1990 and regularly attracts 300,000 visitors from all over the world each year .			2
