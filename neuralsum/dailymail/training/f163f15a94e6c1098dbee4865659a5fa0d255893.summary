@entity1 election officials repeatedly offered ballots last week to an impostor who arrived at polling places with the names and addresses of ' inactive ' voters who had n't participated in elections for many years			1
no fraudulent votes were actually cast : it was the latest undercover video sting from conservative activist @entity11 , whose filmmaking résumé reads like a target list of liberal causes			1
he famously shuttered @entity15 , the community organizing outfit once linked to @entity16			0
he dressed in an @entity18 costume and waded across the @entity19 from @entity20 to @entity21 as a show of disdain for @entity21 border policy			1
he videotaped people admitting they sold taxpayer - provided cellphones for drugs , shoes , handbags and spending cash			0
now @entity11 has strolled into more than 20 voting precincts in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity1 , proffering the names of people who seldom vote in order to test the integrity of the election process			1
it seems to have failed on a massive scale			0
' i just sign this and then i can vote ? ' he asked one poll worker			0
' yep , ' came the reply			0
in 2016 , however , an aggressive voter id law will take effect in the @entity1			0
last week @entity11 's @entity76 organization took its first deep - dive into @entity1 election politics , filming @entity79 campaign workers saying they would help illegal immigrants vote for incumbent senator @entity81			1
this time he strolled into polling places in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 to see how easy it would be to vote fraudulently in the name of another person			1
he was offered twenty ballots at a variety of polling places before a pair of officials finally challenged him			1
' they wanted to protect the system , ' @entity11 says in the video , released exclusively to @entity93			2
' they had to break the rules to do it			0
' ' of all of the undercover investigations i 've conducted , this was by far the easiest , ' he said monday			0
' they were willing to pass out fraudulently obtained ballots like it was @entity105 candy			2
' if @entity1 is a hotbed of voter fraud – conservatives suggest it is , and that the dynamic benefits @entity79 – the ground rules will change before the 2016 election			1
in 2013 governor @entity112 signed a set of sweeping new voting rules into law , including a no - exceptions requirement that voters show a government - issued @entity118 on @entity55			2
' the state legislature took extremely aggressive steps to curtail the voting rights of african - americans , ' @entity21 attorney general @entity120 claimed at the time			1
after a lawsuit from the @entity16 administration and a series of legal appeals , the @entity21 @entity125 ruled last month that the state is entitled to make voters prove who they are			2
that provision of the law wo n't go into effect until 2016 – other sections , including a ban on same - day voter registration , are in force already – making this go - round the last of its kind in the @entity1			2
but @entity112 's government is already sending @entity144 mobile units into 32 communities this month , two years ahead of time , to provide free ids to anyone who wants them			2
guerrilla videographer @entity11 went to polling places in three @entity1 cities , posing as people who records show had n't voted in ages election officials offered @entity11 forms to sign and promised they would let him vote ( he never actually signed forms , voted , or claimed to be the people whose names he was using ) ballots for everyone : helpful election workers are following the law by opening the voting booth to all comers , but in 2016 the system will be turned on its head the offer is an important one : the 24th amendment to the @entity170 prohibits the levying of ' poll taxes , ' meaning that if an @entity118 is required to vote , a free option must be made available			1
by this time in 2016 , the state government hopes , naysayers who see the voter id law as a barrier to minorities and the poor will see hundreds of thousands of new , zero - cost @entity147 coming out of voters ' wallets and purses			0
for now , though , @entity11 is using @entity1 as a proxy for the other 42 states – and the @entity65 – which do n't require voters to show a photo id			1
his crew used publicly available election rolls to identify ' inactive ' voters and then chose 30 - year - old men for him to impersonate			0
the final footage shows election officials , over and over , accepting @entity11 's claim that he was one of those people			1
' with almost three - quarters - of - a - million inactive voters and no voter id law in place , we could have turned the election results for most major candidates in the state , ' he claimed monday			2
' what we uncovered in this video illustrates how easy it would be for a well - orchestrated campaign with no regard for the law to change the outcome of a major election			0
voter laws across the country need to be changed immediately to prevent this sort of potential voter fraud			0
' @entity214 : one poll worker realized that the name and address @entity11 offered belonged to someone who had n't voted in a long time – but he actually broke the law by insisting on seeing identification @entity11 has tweaked the political left on the contentious voter id issue before			1
in 2012 he filmed an actor walking into a @entity65 polling place and giving an official the name and address of @entity120 – the @entity21 attorney general who was so outspoken against @entity118 requirements			1
the young man was offered the high - ranking @entity16 administration official 's ballot before pulling @entity11 pulled the plug on their experiment			1
in the resulting video , the impostor is seen offering to go to his car and produce a photo id ' faster than you can say " furious " ' – a dig at @entity120 , who presided over the botched @entity245 gunwalking scandal			2
' you do n’t need it , ' the poll worker replied , referring to the @entity118			0
' it ’s all right			0
' ' as long as you ’re in here , you ’re on our list , and that ’s who you say you are , you ’re okay			0
' in other videos , @entity11 has demonstrated that @entity258 residents could get ballots in the names of deceased persons , and that @entity262 could vote by offering the names of sports superstars including @entity266 quarterback @entity265			2
some voter fraud episodes , though , become news on their own			0
one that surfaced on saturday appeared to track with what might have happened if @entity11 had broken the law and actually voted with the ballots he was offered			1
in @entity275 , @entity20 , the county clerk reported that a voter trying to cast an ballot during the ' early voting ' period was shocked to learn that someone had already voted in his name three days earlier			1
in @entity1 , as in 18 other states and five @entity21 territories , no identification at all is required before people exercise their right to vote in the 2014 congressional midterm elections racist ? some civil rights activists insist a move to require ids at the polls is rooted in anti-black prejudice , but the late @entity293 president @entity292 advocated the same policy at the start of the @entity297 1999 election campaign he had n't voted , he insisted			1
and the signature on the first voter card filed in his name did n't match his own			0
the man was allowed to vote on what 's known as a ' provisional ballot , ' and it 's unclear whether it will be counted			2
@entity307 , the director of @entity20 's @entity308 , told @entity309 that local election officials in the state 's northern reaches were n't to blame			1
' i have nothing but praise for their efforts to try to ensure integrity in the election , ' @entity307 said			0
' it is just that under current law , there are no means available to poll workers to help them determine if a voter is actually the person he says he is			0
' like @entity1 , @entity20 has no law on the books requiring an id on @entity55 .			0

conservative guerrilla filmmaker @entity11 pretended to be a series of @entity331 who had n't voted in years
in precinct after precinct , election officials offered him ballots without confirming his identity
only one polling place turned him away without an @entity118 , but officials there were breaking the rules in order to do it
@entity11 famously *embarrassed* @entity21 attorney general @entity120 by obtaining the *cabinet* *member* 's ballot in @entity65 as a protest against the lack of an @entity118 *mandate* at the polls – a racially charged @entity21 *controversy*
@entity20 officials said saturday that someone had fraudulently voted in the name of a man who later showed up in person to cast his ballot
