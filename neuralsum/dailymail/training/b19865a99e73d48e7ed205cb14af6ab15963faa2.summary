by @entity0 what started out as a man with a passion for photographing the sea , has now become the entire world for an early - rising and seriously skilled photographer from @entity7			1
in 1999 @entity8 begun to wake that little bit earlier before his commute into the city to his full - time design job , and took the time to capture the sunrise			1
every morning since then @entity17 , as he 's known to nearly 45,000 @entity16 subscribers , has photographed the first light of the day over @entity20 's iconic @entity19			1
@entity21 began more than 15 years ago , when @entity8 decided to photograph the sunrise over @entity19 every morning @entity17 specialises in underwater photography , and what begun as a hobby has become his entire business another of his trademarks is aerial shots , sometimes taken from a remote operated helicopter @entity21 has taken @entity17 and his family around the world to shoot in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 since 1999 @entity36 has sent a daily email with shots of the sunrise over @entity19 to subscribers ' i believe in the niche			1
my niche is underwater and aerial shots of @entity46 beaches , i started doing aerials about five years ago , ' @entity17 told the @entity48			1
' i 'm looking for interesting light , a lot of action , bright colours			0
' and distinctive is exactly what @entity17 's pics are , showing stunning serene waters in some images , while others showcase tumultuous swell and surfers taking on huge barrels and breaks			1
most portray incredible light patterns , some are perfectly formed waves against a bright backdrop , while the underwater shots reveal the full power of the sea from a whole new perspective			0
intricate and interesting light patterns are prevalent in many of the @entity74 photographs almost 45,000 people now subscribe to the emails , which arrive in inboxes around the world each weekday @entity17 photographs all sorts of swimmers and surfers good and bad and tried to capture what happens down the beach in the early morning aerials are a big part of his portfolio , which he started shooting five years ago though the images usually feature bright colours , black and white photographs sometimes make an appearance before the immediacy of social media and the infinite blogs which flood the online world , @entity17 was a pioneer of sorts , sending a daily email to friends and family featuring his favourite shot of the morning , giving people that little escape as they sat in their cubicles or at their desks			1
' basically i just emailed 20 friends , then 50 , then 1000 and it just grew , ' @entity17 told the @entity48			2
' in the 90s daily pictures of the beach were n't as prevalent			0
' just one year after @entity114 's inception , @entity17 turned his passion for photographing the ocean into @entity16 , a website which now has fans and clients all around the world and a permanent art gallery in @entity7			1
i ca n't remember anyone selling photography online when we started			0
' crystal clear waters and perfectly formed waves make up much of the @entity16 archives the photographs often feature one or more subjects , and are n't exclusively of the sea itself the crowded shores of @entity7 are also a big feature in the @entity136 images serene beach scenes perfectly composed and captured are another identifying factor in @entity36 's shots the gallery is just back from @entity19 and @entity17 insists he wants people to feel comfortable and spend time in the place he describes his site as somewhat ' under the radar ' despite boasting 104,781 @entity146 likes and a further 47,552 followers on @entity148			1
and that 's in addition to the 44,125 website subscribers			0
' the ultimate compliment for me is for someone to say " i think that 's one of @entity16 ' shots " , in a time when there 's just a sea of photography and we 're bombarded with mediocre pictures			2
there 's a lot of noise			0
' @entity21 has collaborated and partnered with some of the biggest brands in @entity46 and the world , including @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 just to name a few			1
one of his photographs was featured as a print on @entity176 thongs last summer , and the shoe was the biggest selling design after plain black			0
' everyone was really surprised by how well that did , ' @entity17 admitted			2
still waters and spectacular sunrises are often seen in the daily @entity16 emails skilled surfers are a favourite subject for @entity187 to shoot , as he loves being out in the waves himself the @entity7 beach lover has only missed two morning shoots , the days his two sons were born @entity21 has collaborated with huge surf brands such as @entity168 swimwear and @entity176 thongs the shots give a different perspective to the sea through @entity17 's lens despite this , the photographer maintains ' we 're really fussy about who we do collaborations with , we get a lot of offers from huge brands			1
' he also urges that he would n't have enjoyed the same successes if he was n't so devoted to the work			0
' you just have to it with passion , i started something i was so passionate about , and did it for free in my spare time for the first five years			2
it 's so important when you start with something you love			0
' @entity21 takes the @entity216 every single year , and @entity17 has surfed swells and photographed waves in @entity32 , @entity35 , the @entity219 , @entity34 , and @entity220			2
' you name it , i 've done it , ' he said			0
' helicopters in the @entity224 , over the @entity225 ... we ( along with his wife and two young boys ) spend a month every year in @entity32			0
' the images show the @entity46 beach culture quite literally in a unique light beaches in @entity220 , the @entity219 and @entity233 also make appearances in the collection @entity17 and his wife @entity236 recently travelled to @entity237 and @entity238 to investigate the overseas market who are also purchasing the prints photographs with lots of action and movement in them are preferable for the photographer the early morning shoots are a ritual for @entity17 , who says he feels like his routine is interrupted if he does n't get out in the water @entity17 said it 's ' very rare ' for him to ever miss a morning in the surf at @entity7 , and described his early alarms as a ' ritual			1
' ' the days my sons were born i was n't down ... it has to be extreme circumstances			2
' on an overseas trip earlier this year @entity17 and wife @entity236 spent time in @entity238 and @entity237 , trying to scope out the market , as they ship prints to both cities every week			2
' we were trying to figure out how people find out about us , ' he said , and added that they have plans in the works to get some of the brand there , and looked at the possibility of adding galleries overseas			0
there is something distinctive about the style of the @entity277 photographs swimmers of all sorts have made appearances in the stunning series of snapshots of the sea simplicity is sometimes king in the serene images light and colour plays a big role in the composition of @entity16 photographs the thing all the images have in common is @entity17 's clear passion for what he does and his love of the ocean for now though , the home of @entity16 is at a stunning location just back from @entity19 , and @entity17 said insisted ' it 's not like a regular shop			1
' ' i want people to feel comfortable for a while , i want people to come for an hour or two			0
it 's all free , you subscribe free			0
' @entity16 ' roots are firmly planted in the beachside community , and @entity17 credits that , in part , to its great success .			1

@entity8 ( @entity36 ) has been waking up early every day for the last 15 years to catch the sunrise over @entity19
the ritual started purely as a hobby but out of that grew @entity319 , a site which sends a photo out daily
there is also an @entity16 gallery and the brand has collaborated with some of @entity46 's biggest *companies*
@entity17 has only missed shooting on two mornings , on the days both his sons were born
