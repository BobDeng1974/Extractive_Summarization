the 28 - year - old sustained a hip injury in @entity18 ' @entity17 semi-final defeat by @entity19 on saturday , but is on track to resume training on monday			1
ready : @entity4 ( left ) has declared himself fit for @entity0 's first test against @entity3 @entity0 depart for @entity3 the following day and by the time they run - out at @entity25 , @entity4 expects to be fit to continue an outstanding season			1
' it 's a deep hip muscle injury , ' said @entity4 , winner of @entity0 player of the year at the @entity30 awards dinner on wednesday night			1
' i gave everything a big yank when i was twisted in the tackle on that turf			0
' it 's feeling good each day			0
a bit more recovery and on monday i 'll be ready to rock and roll in training			0
it 's definitely looking good for that first test			0
' i 've had the same problem before after tough games , but to a lesser extent , so i know how to get rid of it and what i need to do			0
' i 've got great people around me to help me get fit and i ca n't wait to get out to @entity3			1
' @entity4 's improving fitness will be greeted with relief by head coach @entity51 , who has seen his plans for the first test continue to unravel amid @entity54 's withdrawal			2
official confirmation that the 21 - year - old requires an operation is expected after friday 's night 's @entity59 final against @entity60 in @entity61 , his final game of the season			2
@entity54 was destined to start at @entity25 as @entity64 and @entity65 are involved in the @entity17 final on may 31 and will be unavailable until the second @entity67 must choose between the recently returned @entity68 , out of form @entity69 or @entity71 , who is struggling with an ankle injury , at fly - half			2
winner : @entity4 ( centre ) receives the @entity77 award adding to @entity51 's concerns , besides the absence of players from @entity17 finalists @entity60 and @entity19 , is a crisis at hooker where potentially his first three choices in the position will be unable to tour			1

missing out : @entity9 fly - half @entity7 ( right ) will miss the tour to undergo shoulder surgery history and circumstance , however , are unable to dim @entity4 's belief that the @entity112 hosts are capable of toppling the all - conquering @entity12			1
' i do n't see why we ca n't win this series			0
we 've put in two good performances against @entity3 , beaten them once and narrowly lost once , ' he said			2
' it will be unbelievably tough playing the number one team on their home patch			0
' they 'll come flying into us and the fact we 're missing a few guys for that first test makes it even harder for us			0
