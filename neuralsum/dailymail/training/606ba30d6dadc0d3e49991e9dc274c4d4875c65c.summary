the clip , which lasts for almost nine minutes , opens with the 43 - year - old photojournalist giving an account of what he claims was a failed rescue attempt by @entity14 forces on july 4 - @entity37			1
he goes on to say that he has ' accepted ' that he will suffer the ' same fate ' as his executed cellmates but that he blames the @entity2 and @entity14 governments and not the insurgents , who he refers to as the mujahideen			1
asked about this latest video , @entity44 spokesman said : ' we are aware of a further video and are analysing its contents			1
' it comes just days after a video purporting to show the severed head of @entity14 aid worker @entity53 and a mass murder of @entity9 soldiers emerged			1
since august , is has filmed and posted online the deaths of four @entity59 hostages			0
@entity2 aid workers @entity61 and @entity62 and @entity14 journalists @entity63 and @entity65 were beheaded on camera by the jihadi organisation			1
in the most recent video from the militants , which has been posted online , mr @entity0 looks gaunt as he delivers his lecture from inside a dark room			1
he begins by saying : ' in this programme i will tell you about a failed raid to rescue us and how it feels to be left for dead by your own government			1
' it marks a departure from the last video of mr @entity0 - released last month - which saw him being used as a news reporter from the battle - ravaged city of @entity85			1
in this latest clip , the sixth in the apparent ' series ' , mr @entity0 said that he accepts he will most likely face the same fate as his cellmates , but says he blames @entity91 and president @entity92 in the latest clip , mr @entity0 goes on to claim that the @entity14 staged an ' incredibly complex , risky and expensive ' attempt to rescue hostages in july			1
he said : ' the raid involved two dozen @entity97 commandos , several @entity99 helicopters , gunships , predator drones , @entity102 and refuelling aircraft			2
' it took weeks of rehearsals and must have cost tens of millions to perform - but we were n't there			2
' @entity109 , anticipating such a move , just put us into cars and moved us to another prison days beforehand			1
' he also admits that he ' long ago ' ' accepted ' that his fate will be ' overwhelmingly the same as his cellmates '			1
but while he says that he blames prime minister @entity91 and president @entity92 for his situation - not his captors			2
he also claims that the leaders knew he was being held hostage for ' more than a year ' and added that they were aware that they could be beheaded			1
he claimed that the leaders are ' treating their lives like a gamble , like a roll of the dice , ' and said that their actions felt like the ' ultimate betrayal ' he said : ' @entity92 and @entity91 act all shocked and appalled each time one of us is killed but they have known this was coming for months			0
' they have known our six names , who was holding us , and the consequences of not negotiating for over a year			2
' so for them to act all shocked each time one of us is executed is a massive lie to the public and our families			2
' long ago i accepted that my fate would be overwhelmingly the same as my cellmates and i am angry about it			1
' he claimed that the leaders are ' treating their lives like a gamble , like a roll of the dice , ' and said that their actions felt like the ' ultimate betrayal '			0
he also accuses @entity2 and @entity14 of taking military action rather than negotiating the release of hostages through options such as ransom payments			2
he says : ' we were left to die			0
it 's the worse feeling in the world being left behind like that			0
' we have been in the longest , paid our dues , watched everyone else go home , never stopped believing and wham ! have some of that			0
you 're not worth negotiating for			0
' he focuses on the @entity165 government 's record for paying out ransom demands , stating that ' since 2008 , @entity165 has reportedly paid $ 58 million of ransom payments to different @entity169 groups , nearly 10 million a year			2
' the @entity2 journalist comments : ' would n't it be cheaper to release the @entity173 prisoners as asked ? ' he also raises the case of @entity175 , a @entity176 soldier who was held captive by the @entity178 - aligned @entity177 in @entity179 from june 2009 until his release in may 2014			2
mr @entity0 says : ' he was one man			1
we were six and @entity182 asked for @entity173 prisoners in exchange for all of us			0
yes , @entity175 was a soldier and three of us were @entity2 but a civilian live , all six of them , not worth discussing ? ' he added : ' we are not big people			0
we are not @entity14 soldiers			2
but we are no more less important than everyone else who went home			0
' the footage , seen above , marks a departure from the fifth video that was released of mr @entity0 , which saw him being used as a news reporter from the battle - ravaged city of @entity85 towards the end of the video , he says : ' i will continue to speak out against this military action ... for as long as the mujahideen allow me to live			1
' it is not the first time mr @entity0 's experience in journalism has been utilised by @entity3 , as last month his name was put to an article which appeared in a propaganda magazine designed to inflame the feelings of @entity210 followers			1
this is the seventh video to feature mr @entity0 and comes after his sister said last month that she thinks he believes ' two - thirds ' of what he says on camera			1
@entity216 also made an emotional appeal for her brother 's return , pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home			0
she has also previously appealed for ' direct contact ' with the militants holding him			0

the clip emerged as the @entity182 released a seventh propaganda video showing @entity2 hostage @entity0			1
@entity246 was referring to @entity182 's leader @entity257 's recent call for followers to ' explode volcanos of jihad everywhere			0
' @entity261 said @entity3 " forced the nation , all the nation , to pledge allegiance ' in absence of ' consultation ' with other @entity268 leaders			0
his message was posted on one of @entity239 @entity238 's official @entity272 pages			0
he said : ' they revoked the legitimacy of all the @entity169 groups across the @entity169 world ...			0
and drove a wedge among @entity279 ranks by collecting allegiances from within the @entity268 groups			0
' they announced the expansion of their caliphate in a number of countries in which they have no mandate			0
' the @entity182 extremists initially fought to oust @entity9 president @entity291			2
but other groups , including @entity238 central command , disavowed them			0
smaller groups across the region have pledged allegiance to @entity297 while the larger @entity238 affiliates remain silent regarding @entity297 's outreach			0
among the more significant loyalty pledges came from @entity302 's @entity301			0
the @entity14 considers @entity238 in @entity239 to be one of the most dangerous local branches of the global terror organization because it has been linked to several failed attacks on the @entity14 homeland			1
the group is led by @entity309 , a onetime close associate to @entity310			0
