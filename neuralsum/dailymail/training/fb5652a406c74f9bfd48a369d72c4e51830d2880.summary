by @entity1 reporter published : 22:27 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 22:28 est , 17 september 2013 seats to next years @entity3 at @entity4 in @entity5 will cost double compared to last year			1
the @entity7 is about to approve a plan that will see club - level seats to the @entity11 venue cost $ 2,600 each			1
last year , the most sought after tickets to the game went for $ 1,250			0
price hike : next years tickets to the @entity16 will cost more that double what they did in @entity19 in 2013 market value : tickets for 9,000 premium seats will cost about $ 2,600 each , more than double the $ 1,250 price of similar tickets at last season Â¿ s @entity16 in @entity19 that 's more than double the price of the most coveted tickets from last year 's game , which went for $ 1,250			1
the price hike will affect roughly 9,000 tickets however , the aim is for 30 % of tickets to cost less than $ 800			0
the second cheapest batch of seats are due to cost around $ 1,500 - up from $ 950 in the @entity19			0
the league has explained the drastic price hikes by stating the rise simply brings the tickets more into line with their market value			1
@entity7 logic : we are looking to close the gap between the face value of the ticket and its true value as reflected on the secondary market all @entity16 tickets usually sell for well above face value on the secondary market			1
' we are looking to close the gap between the face value of the ticket and the true value of a ticket to what has become the premier sports and entertainment event , ' @entity7 spokesman @entity51 said			1
it 's not all about raising costs , however , the @entity7 has said it is dropping prices for the cheapest seats to $ 500 next year from $ 600 in 2013			2
last years premium tickets that officially cost $ 1,250 sold for $ 6,000 and over according to the @entity63			2
cheaper : tickets for the next tier of seats are expected to cost $ 1,500 each , compared with $ 950 in @entity19			2
about 40 percent of general admission seats will cost less than $ 1,000 the @entity16 is an odd occasion in some ways because even the most ardent fans do n't usually get the chance to buy tickets directly for their face value			1
the two participating teams get 17.5 % of available tickets ( about 14,000 each ) , and the league gets to distribute the remaining 25 % to sponsors and partners			0
all 32 teams get a set number of tickets that they distribute to season - ticket holders via a lottery			0
it means that most spectators at the game will have bought their tickets on the secondary market			2
the @entity7 is arguing that if people are prepared to pay extortionate prices on that secondary ticket , then the organization that hosts the @entity16 should be entitled to take a bigger share also			1
the organization says it has done its own research about how much the tickets are really worth			0
many $ 600 tickets resold for close to $ 2,000 whilst premium club seats ended up selling around the $ 6,000 mark			0
and just like everything else in @entity5 , officials are arguing that the 50 million people living near next years northeastern venue can afford to shell out a bit more .			0

most tickets that are sold by the @entity7 are resold at double or triple face value
@entity7 wants to cash in on @entity16 tickets ' true market value '
@entity113 can afford to pay more for tickets compared to other areas
