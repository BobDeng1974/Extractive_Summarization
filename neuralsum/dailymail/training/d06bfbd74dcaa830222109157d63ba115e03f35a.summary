an @entity1 policeman is a part of a crew that have successfully rowed across the @entity4 to break two world records and raise money for @entity7			1
they started as a crew of seven , but after 57 days six people , including @entity12 @entity11 , completed the continent - to - continent expedition , which is the fastest and longest rowboat crossing of the @entity4			1
' there were pirates , hurricanes , our boat was hit by a 15 - metre blue whale , we encountered countless tiger sharks - there is nothing else the ocean could have possibly thrown at us but i actually never wanted it to end			1
' i would n't change a single one of the challenges we faced ' says mr @entity11 , speaking to @entity28 from their @entity29			1
the crew pop champagne as part of their excited celebrations as they reach the shore of @entity29 , successfully completing their record breaking expedition across the @entity4			1
the exhausted crew upon arrival at @entity29 after their almost 8600km row the crew on board the @entity43 , the vessel which they rowed from @entity46 , @entity1 to the @entity29 , east of the @entity48 mainland			1
the crew included @entity11 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
dr @entity55 , a 39 - year - old chemical engineer from @entity56 , was forced to drop out halfway through the trip when he suffered serious burns after scalding himself with hot water			1
dr @entity55 was on hand to welcome the crew in at @entity29			1
' the arrival was a big event with a lot of champagne ! there was a lot of happiness and relief after such a long voyage			0
they came off the boat with a bit of a staggered walk but are all doing very well , ' dr @entity55 tells @entity28 from @entity29			1
@entity1 policeman @entity11 on the morning his expedition departed from @entity46 , @entity1			1
57 days later , his crew had successfully rowed to @entity29			1
mr @entity11 agrees that the crew are struggling to get their bearings on dry land			1
' we were walking down the street the other day and one of the crew fell into a pothole ! after 57 days at see , you think you 're walking straight but you have n't quite got a grip on how your body works			1
' the exhausted crew are looking forward to ' a dry bed that does n't move , ' according to mr @entity11			1
the team have lost a lot of weight during their expedition			2
' the problem was that we faced hurricanes , with wild waves			2
it looks like we faced over 65 knot winds at times			0
such extreme winds are n't characteristic of ocean rowing and it took the team a while to manage to keep their food down ' , explains dr @entity55			1
the crew worked tirelessly , taking only two hour rests before picking up the oars again			2
' we rowed for two hours on and two hours off 24 hours a day , seven days a week for the entire journey			2
you lose track of time , the physicality of it all is so painful , ' said mr @entity11 but the mental struggle was one of the biggest that the crew had to battle with during the trip			1
' it was the most torturous , treacherous , wonderful , brilliant , life - changing experience , ' explains mr @entity11			2
the challenge was only made harder after the automatic steering system failed , and mr @entity11 and the crew 's skipper , @entity50 , were both forced to manually navigate the boat			1
' we knew it would hurt , but the physicality of having to stand still to navigate was excruciating			0
in the military , standing still for that period of time is used as discipline ! ' it required 100 per cent concentration and it was really difficult to try and maintain course through the rain and cloud that completely obscured our vision			0
' the @entity43 at sea , with the @entity1 flag at the back of the boat used as a crucial tool to help steer and navigate - vital after the automatic steering system broke down and @entity11 and @entity50 were required to manually steer for the rest of the journey			1
mr @entity50 , who now holds five @entity146 for ocean rowing , says the mental challenge is more arduous than the physicality of rowing			0
' it 's intensely physical but the relentless routine and the sheer scale of the obstacle that you have to overcome is the hardest			2
you have to constantly be at the top of your game			0
however , mr @entity50 says the team must remain level - headed at all times - even when the crew came face to face with pirates			2
' there 's far too much to do , you do n't have time for nerves on the ocean			2
it 's later when you look back on the brush with storms and pirates that you sit down and have a deep sigh ! ' said mr @entity50			0
' a boat with no markings or fishing equipment came alongside us , which indicates that you 're dealing with pirates			0
they asked us to stop but there was no way we were giving up that easily			0
we were 200 miles away from our destination			0
' we just had to bluff			0
we had no equipment on board but we said we were a @entity186 boat waiting for @entity187 and would open fire			0
they high - tailed it out of there , it was absolutely amazing ! a photo taken by crew member @entity55 at beautiful @entity29 , an island off the coast of @entity48 , where the crew is happily relaxing and enjoying a well - deserved break after their successful 8600km row excited friends and family wait for their loved ones to arrive at @entity29 after their 57 day expedition across the @entity4 @entity55 , who was evacuated halfway through the row after suffering burns , waiting at @entity29 for the crew to arrive on august 8 mr @entity50 says the inability to control your environment is a liberating experience			1
' i row oceans because i have never experienced the same sense of freedom and adventure on land as i did in those moments on the boat			2
' ' there are sharks all around you , @entity221 ... it 's a beautiful environment			0
the ocean is one of the last great wildernesses			0
' we saw a couple of @entity228 from our tiny little boat			0
you have a primal reaction : fight or flight			0
' a 15 - metre whale came too - close for comfort , causing damage to the team 's boat			1
' it was as if the whale deliberately collided with the boat , it seemed to be scratching a skin irritation , ' said mr @entity11			2
' a huge whale and little boat ... it was potentially expedition ending ! ' another obstacle the crew had to overcome was losing the sixth member of their team , mr @entity55			1
' a big cargo ship with medical facilities came and picked me up			0
the ship actually banged into the rowing boat while they were taking me on board			0
it took eight days to travel back to @entity1 and i was confined to my room for seven of those days , to avoid reinfecting my burns , ' mr @entity55 said			1
mr @entity11 is ecstatic about the crew 's achievement			1
' it was honestly the most epic adventure anyone could go on			0
it was a pioneering first world attempt and i still ca n't get my head around the fact that we did it ! it surpassed every one of my expectations			0
' the @entity271 on board : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity55 , preparing on the day of their departure on june 11 , 2014 the crew on board the ' @entity43 ' - their vessel that took them almost 8600 kilometres across the @entity4 the crew came across pirates , sharks , hurricanes and a 15 - metre long @entity283 , which used the boat to scratch an itch , much to the crew 's mixed fear and amusement @entity11 has so far raised more than $ 30 thousand for @entity7 , a cause close to his heart as his mother struggles with the condition			1
' @entity293 was out on a boat with the other family members and met us when we reached @entity29			2
to see her face at the end was unbelievable , the emotion and relief on her face			0
we had minimal contact with anyone during the trip so i think her heart was in her mouth the entire time we were at sea			0
' mr @entity11 found he gained insight about life with @entity312 , a debilitating disease of the @entity313			1
' i was surprised that there was some synergy between my experience on the row with the kinds of struggles i 've seen my mum face with @entity312 ' with @entity312 you want to do things but it does n't work that way			2
your brain wo n't cooperate with your brain which makes it really difficult to do the things you want to			0
i 'm able to empathise with that struggle more now after the physical struggle of the row			2
' we faced hurricanes with winds that kept pushing us @entity48 as we tried to row @entity333			1
we were prevented from doing what we wanted for a myriad of reasons			0
but you push through every obstacle and something you change your goals but just have to keep going			0
' it 's a little like the brave people with @entity312 that still manage to live and achieve with their symptoms everyday			2
' mr @entity11 found the physical and mental challenge to be a humbling and profound experience			2
' i learnt so much about myself and about people - about what you can achieve as a group of people in arduous circumstances when you need to			0
' i 'm really going to miss my time being on a very small boat in a very big ocean where i did n't have any control , just the small ability to work with i have , fighting all the way			0
' it changes your philosophy about life			0
it makes your realise the importance of letting go			0
so many obstacles pop up along the way that want to take you out and knock you over , but all you can do is just do one stroke after the other and eventually you 'll get there			0
and hopefully it 's a paradise like @entity29 ' @entity11 revealing the logo on the side of the boat for one of the charities the crew were raising fund for , save the elephants the six - member crew on the morning of their departure			1
five people successfully completed the row after @entity55 was evacuated halfway through the expedition , after he suffered burns from scalding hot water			1

crew of six successfully rowed almost 8600km across the @entity4
in 57 days , travelled from @entity1 to @entity29 , off @entity48 coast

@entity12 @entity11 campaigning for @entity312 , *inspired* by his mother 's struggle
