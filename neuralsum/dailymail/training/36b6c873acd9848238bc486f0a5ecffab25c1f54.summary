by @entity0 published : 21:04 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 05:29 est , 21 january 2014 dozens of motorists facing prosecution after an horrific 150 - car pile - up will be allowed to take a driver awareness course rather than going to court			1
police said it was ‘ a miracle ’ no - one was killed in the fog bound accident on the @entity12 in @entity13 last september			1
they claimed to have ‘ overwhelming evidence ’ that some motorists were driving without due care and attention and ‘ at speeds which prevented them being able to stop in the distances that they could see ahead ’			1
carnage : emergency service attend the huge pile - up on the @entity12 bridge in @entity13 witnesses spoke of some motorists driving ‘ like idiots ’ before the crash , which closed the crossing in both directions for more than nine hours			1
despite this a senior police officer said handing 32 drivers a chance to go on the course would be ‘ far more beneficial ’ for the drivers involved than putting them before the courts			1
motorists who decline to take up attending the course will automatically be summonsed to court , said the police			0
the controversial decision to spare drivers prosecution follows a four - month investigation by specialist collision investigators and case review staff from @entity47			2
eight people suffered serious injuries and 200 others were treated at the scene following the crash , which started at around 7.15am			0
it then continued for 10 minutes as cars and lorries crashed into each other on the bridge ’s @entity58 - bound section in visibility that was down to 25 yards			0
massive : some 150 cars were involved in a huge crash on the @entity12 in @entity13 in september last year in conditions of thick fog - but they will be given a driving course , not prosecuted , it was announced inspector @entity68 , head of the serious collision investigation unit at @entity47 , said it was ‘ quite simply a miracle ’ that no - one was killed			1
@entity73 was a major factor , but evidence from investigators suggested some motorists failed to drive appropriately for the conditions			0
letters have now been sent to 32 drivers , offering them the chance to enrol on an awareness course rather than go to court , said @entity47			0
as part of the one - day , self - funding course , drivers will sit through an interactive classroom session followed by a supervised drive in front of an instructor			2
' miracle ' : despite the dangerous driving seen on the day , nobody was killed in the crash damage : despite claims of driving ' like idiots ' , nobody will be prosecuted in the wake of the accident inspector @entity68 said : ‘ clearly the thick fog that descended on the bridge that day made driving conditions incredibly challenging and was a contributory factor in the resulting collision which stretched from the approach right across the bridge			1
‘ while a significant number of drivers did precisely the right thing by driving to the conditions , our investigation has provided overwhelming evidence that in some cases motorists were not driving with due care and attention and were travelling at speeds which prevented them being able to stop in the distances that they could see ahead			1
’ but he said : ‘ rather than go through the process of taking these people to court , it was felt that offering an educational outcome would prove far more beneficial for the drivers involved			2
' driving at speed without clear visibility is without doubt extremely dangerous and the fact there was not a single fatality on the day is quite simply a miracle			2
’ the police inspector added : ‘ this has been a thorough investigation of what was the biggest collision in the county and certainly the largest our team has had to deal with			0
‘ the emergency services and partner agencies worked together to support those involved in the collision			0
' attention then quickly turned to the recovery process and getting the crossing back up and running by the early evening , which was no mean feat. ’			0

they also said they had ' overwhelming evidence ' of illegal driving
police say its ' more beneficial ' to educate than put drivers through courts
