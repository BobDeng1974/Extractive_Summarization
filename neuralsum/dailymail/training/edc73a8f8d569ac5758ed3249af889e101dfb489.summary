the @entity0 is calling on the world 's most powerful countries to urgently develop the technology and weapons systems to destroy asteroids and meteors that threaten @entity7			2
almost 1,200 people suffered injuries last week when an untracked lump of space rock exploded over the @entity12 , with the debris narrowly missing a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of @entity16 , with a population of 1.13 million			2
hours later the closely - monitored asteroid 2012 @entity18 buzzed the planet at a distance of only 17,200 miles , the closest ever known for an object of such size , equivalent to an @entity24 swimming pool			1
@entity26 officials called for nations to join forces to create an early warning system to prepare for asteroid threats terrifying : a meteorite shower hit @entity26 injuring at least 100 people , including school children the @entity0 has called for a a joint effort to detect asteroids after the @entity12 region was struck by falling fragments ' instead of fighting on @entity7 , people should be creating a joint system of asteroid defence , ' demanded @entity41 , a close ally of president @entity42 and chairman of the @entity26 foreign affairs parliamentary committee			1
he urged the @entity46 , @entity26 and @entity47 to join forces to create an @entity49 , warning this was far more urgent that the @entity46 priority of a @entity53 - based star wars defence system aimed at deterring attacks from rogue states			1
deputy premier @entity56 made clear @entity26 will lead an international drive for such a move			1
' i have already spoken of the need for an international initiative aimed at creating an early warning system that would also prevent extraterrestrial objects from coming dangerously close to the @entity7 , ' he said			1
' @entity64 must create a system to identify and neutralize objects that pose a danger to the @entity7			2
' the disaster in the @entity12 - which led to damage to hundreds of buildings from a ten ton space fireball that had the force of a nuclear bomb - was a wake - up call to the world , which is not ready to cope with the threat , he warned			0
' @entity26 and other major countries do have a system of space monitoring and control , but it is mainly geared towards monitoring instances when spacecraft may come dangerously close to space junk , ' he said			2
the key task was ' not waiting for new incidents to happen but handling problems in advance '			0
he called on international players to pull their efforts together instead of ' piling up military stuff in space , aimed only at lowering our planet 's defences '			1
@entity56 expressed the hope this latest incident would make ' officials think of more important issues and look beyond the space horizon '			1
there are some 1,300 space rocks on @entity103 's list of ' potentially hazardous asteroids ' - yet many like the one that struck @entity16 were not tracked in advance			1
@entity16 , 900 miles east of @entity109 and close to the @entity111 border , took the brunt of the impact wake - up call : experts said asteroid 2012 @entity18 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system destruction : officials later said that if an early warning system had been in place , @entity26 would have been able to prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris the @entity46 - based @entity124 , which includes @entity103 veterans , said friday 's close encounters amount to a wake - up call			1
' of the million asteroids as large as or larger than 2012 @entity18 , we have only tracked less than 10,000 , ' said the organisation			1
divers were yesterday scouring frozen @entity132 for remnants of the meteorite that struck on friday with two monumental explosions , as 20,000 emergency workers cleared up the damage from broken glass , collapsed roofs and structural damage to buildings			0
former @entity0 minister @entity142 called for a joint @entity46 , @entity26 and @entity144 initiative			2
' we will clearly have a need to create near - earth stations , with stronger , advanced telescopes , ' he said			0
shockwave : people heading to work in @entity16 , @entity26 , heard what sounded like an explosion , saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the @entity16 and @entity160 regions ' perhaps the calculations might show us that we can even bring nuclear weapons into orbit			0
it is impossible to envisage it now			0
it is a matter of calculations , we need to figure out what needs to be done to detect such meteorites , asteroids , to forecast them coming , to change their trajectory , to destroy them			0
these are tasks for physics and engineering			0
' leading scientist @entity177 stressed : ' it is high time to create a common international centre for monitoring and responding to natural threats from space			0
' the @entity183 should create a special committee within its structure to coordinate efforts			0
' if the meteorite had hit at a different time of day , it could have struck the @entity190 with devastating consequences			0

deputy premier @entity56 called for international early warning system
just 10,000 out of one million asteroids bigger than 2012 @entity18 were tracked
