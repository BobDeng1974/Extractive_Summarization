by @entity0 last updated at 6:49 pm on 4th november 2011 three - year - old @entity1 had to fend for herself for two days after her mother died unexpectedly in their home in @entity5 a three - year - old girl survived for two days on eating cheese and leftover lasagne after her mother died suddenly leaving her locked in her home			1
@entity1 , from @entity10 , @entity5 , also hugged her favourite toy - a teddy bear named @entity13 - as she waited alone in the house near her mother 's body			1
she was rescued when 28 - year - old @entity18 's relatives alerted the authorities when they had not heard from her for two days			1
police who went to the property managed to coax @entity1 to drag a coffee table to the door so she could climb up and unlock it			1
she told them : ' @entity27 wo n't wake up			1
' @entity18 was found face down next to her bed			1
her daughter had been able to drink milk and feed herself with whatever she could find in the fridge			0
@entity1 spent several days in hospital recovering from dehydration and urine burns before attending her mother 's funeral			1
the child 's uncle @entity39 , 24 , said : ' i can only imagine her in there for that long , trying to wake mum up			1
' ' she 's doing okay now			2
when we lowered the coffin into the grave at the cemetery , though , she pointed at it and said , " @entity27 's in there "			1
' mr @entity39 spoke every night to his sister , but he nad his mother grew so concerned after failing to reach her for two days they rang a friend who lived nearby			0
the friend went to the house and saw @entity1 inside but no sign of her mother			1
the dead woman 's mother , @entity59 , said : ' @entity18 and i were very close - she would ring me every morning			1
' one day i was in the garden and that afternoon at about four o'clock ... her brother @entity62 and i said , ' well , we have n't heard from @entity18 '			1
tragic : @entity18 collapsed and died in her home			1
police have said they do not think her death was suspicious ' so we got a friend to go around there and [ the grandchild ] had come to the cat door , but @entity18 had n't , so i dialled 111			1
' but she said she knew her daughter was dead the instant she heard that neighbours couldn ; t contact her			2
' @entity18 would n't have done anything silly , ' she said			1
' she loved @entity1 so much and was a devoted mum			2
but i knew exactly what had happened			0
it 's a mother 's instinct			0
' she added : ' her daughter was everything to her			0
she was the type of person who has a nice way of bringing people together			0
' officers saw the three - year - old inside the house and taught her how to open the door by getting her to stand on a coffee table			0
the child 's grandmother said : ' [ @entity92 ] is still a bit quiet , but she still smiles and she 's one of those kids that makes you laugh and you love to have her around			0
' when we started cleaning and taking @entity18 's stuff out of the flat , she did say " mummy wo n't wake up " and when we went back in , she had shut her mother 's bedroom door			1
' she goes all around the flat happy , but she would not go in that room			0
' mrs @entity1 praised @entity1 for coping so well with the traumatic experience			2
she said : ' @entity1 does n't quite have the spark she used to have but that will come back with time			1
but she still has her little sense of humour			0
' we took her out for lunch and as her uncle @entity110 picked up a chip to put it in his mouth she 'd grab it and eat it - then she 'd laugh her little head off			0
' she said the fact her grand - daughter was left alone ' is what really rips into me the most ... just how resourceful my little granddaughter was			0
the road in @entity10 , @entity5 , where the toddler was found alone but alive the death of ms @entity1 at her house in the @entity124 area of the city is as yet unexplained			2
police and the family believe that she died of natural causes but an investigation on behalf of the coroner has now been started			0
they said the fact @entity18 was face down next to her bed was consistent with her having a heart attack or stroke and falling out of bed , but they said they need to wait for the results of an autopsy			2
they do n't believe @entity18 's death was suspicious			1
the toddler is now awaiting a @entity146 decision about whether she will be returned to her family			0
@entity1 was placed in @entity146 care after the discovery			2
but yesterday , central regional director @entity150 said she hoped to place @entity151 back with her family			0
she said : ' this is an absolutely tragic event and our sympathy goes out to this family			0
@entity146 's preference in these situations is to place children in the care of extended family members as long as this is in the best interests of the child , and circumstances permit			0
' @entity1 was in regular contact with her family , and the agency was working with them to care for @entity1 's immediate needs , ms @entity150 said			1
@entity169 said her daughter had not written a will , and confirmed her family was applying for custody of @entity1			2
meanwhile , a neighbour at the flats in @entity175 , @entity124 , said yesterday that in the days before the discovery silence had descended on the flat where @entity1 and her mother lived			2
' everything had gone pretty quiet because they were normally quite a loud family , going up and down the stairs			0
all of a sudden it got really quiet , ' @entity183 , 23 , said			0
they had recently moved into the flat , which another tenant described as having ' not that good ' a community spirit .			0

police alerted by @entity18 's brother when he had n't been able to contact her
' @entity27 wo n't wake up , ' @entity1 told officers when they arrived
