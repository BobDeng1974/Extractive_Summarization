by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the top civil servant at the @entity3 today came under pressure over 114 missing files related to allegations of child abuse over three decades			1
@entity8 revealed he has not even asked to see a list detailing what the documents related to , as he told mps he presumed they had all been destroyed and not to ' assume there 's anything sinister ' at work			1
the home affairs select committee said a trawl of files last year was ' not satisfactory ' and it was ' odd ' that a report he commissioned had not been read by home secretary @entity21			1
today the committee demanded to know why mr @entity8 did not have the details of the names and serial numbers of the files which were missing			1
he has refused to name the ' mystery man ' he asked to trawl the @entity3 library , but insists he relied on their ' judgement '			2
at the weekend mr @entity8 revealed that a review carried out last year of 746,000 @entity3 files covering 1979 to 1999 had identified ‘ 573 relevant files which had been retained ’			1
but he admitted that another 114 ‘ potentially relevant files ’ had been destroyed , missing or not found			2
however , today mr @entity8 said he did not know if the serial numbers of the missing files had been studied , to see if those adjacent in the records were also missing or if only those linked to child abuse allegations had been ' deliberately removed '			1
@entity51 mp @entity50 said if there are no other cross-references to the missing files it would be ' somewhat sinister '			1
alarmingly , last year 's trawl of files had unearthed 13 items of alleged child abuse , of which four had never been passed to the police			1
four of the cases involved members of staff at the @entity3 who have been prosecuted and sacked in connection with ' pornographic images ' , mr @entity8 revealed			1
it follows the revelation that in 1983 @entity51 mp @entity67 handed a dossier detailing allegations of abuse to the then - home secretary , @entity71			2
but the @entity3 now says it can not find the file			0
the handling of files at the @entity3 has fuelled claims of an @entity77 cover - up			2
@entity79 mp @entity78 called mr @entity8 to give evidence to the home affairs committee after revealing the loss of the files the @entity3 has been given until noon on friday to release details of the missing files to mps			1
appearing before the home affairs select committee today , mr @entity8 was challenged about his decision to commission an internal review last year of the way the @entity3 dealt with allegations of abuse			1
last year 's review concluded the @entity3 had behaved properly , but growing questions about a cover - up has triggered a fresh review			0
@entity98 chairman @entity78 said : ' there is a feeling in the committee that the first review was not satisfactory			2
' he said there remains several issues which ' still need to be chased up '			0
mr @entity78 demanded to know if mr @entity8 had told mrs may last year that his department could not find dozens of files			1
' you did n't tell her then that 114 files had gone missing ? ' mr @entity78 asked			1
mr @entity8 replied : ' i do n't recall doing so			0
i shared with the home secretary the executive summary and broad conclusions			0
i told her what we were doing with the material			0
' but it would not be appropriate for her or indeed for anyone other than a small number of people not least sensitive personal information within the report			0
' indeed i did not see all of the accompanying material myself			0
' he added : ' i am concerned frankly about the 114			0
i am concerned about all the material that we can not find			0
' most of these files were probably destroyed , because the kind of topics that they covered would have been subject to the normal file destruction procedures that were in place at that time			0
' they can not be confirmed to be destroyed because there is not a proper log of what was destroyed and what was n't			0
' but mr @entity78 said : ' this is an odd report that you have commissioned that the home secretary did not want to read			2
' later @entity79 's shadow home secretary @entity145 said : ' there are clearly big questions for the home secretary to answer on how seriously the 2013 review into historic allegations of child abuse was taken			1
' neither she nor her senior official appear to have been briefed on its contents , nor are they aware of the details of the 114 files that went missing			2
' this evidence also shows that @entity21 's decision to instigate only a review of a review into the @entity3 handling is simply not adequate			1
' given the seriousness of the allegations and the weaknesses of the 2013 investigation she must now widen the remit of this latest review into the @entity3 to ensure it has full investigative powers and has a free rein to look more widely into the way things were handled in the @entity172 and @entity173 - regardless of how long ago these are said to have taken place			0
' home secretary @entity21 has asked @entity176 , the chief executive of the @entity177 , to lead a review into the @entity3 handling of historic allegations of child abuse a dossier of allegations of abuse was first passed to then - home secretary @entity71 ( left , leaving his home in @entity186 today ) by @entity51 mp @entity67 in 1983 , but it has been lost or destroyed mrs may has asked @entity176 , the chief executive of the @entity177 , to lead a review into the @entity3 handling of historic allegations of child abuse			1
mr @entity176 will also examine an internal review into claims the @entity3 funded the @entity192 , a paedophile campaign group that was disbanded in 1984			2
his report is expected to take eight to 10 weeks			0
mrs may said she was confident that the work commissioned by mr @entity8 was ' carried out in good faith ' , but added that with ' allegations as serious as these the public need to have complete confidence in the integrity of the investigation 's findings '			0
last year 's investigation found 13 items of information in @entity3 files about alleged child abuse dating back to the period 1979 - 99 , and passed police details of four of the items about which they were not already aware			1
but mrs may told @entity12 that , while records of a number of letters from mr @entity67 were found , there was no sign of a ' @entity67 dossier '			0
the investigation found that 114 potentially relevant files were not available , and were presumed ' destroyed , missing or not found ' , although the independent investigator made clear that he found no evidence to suggest that the files had been removed or destroyed ' inappropriately '			2
mr @entity176 is also to examine that finding that public funds totalling almost £ 500,000 were given to two organisations with links to the notorious @entity192 ( @entity192 )			0
the @entity224 ( @entity224 ) provided £ 65,750 to the @entity225 between 1974 and 1980 and £ 410,500 to the @entity226 between 1974 and 1984 .			0
