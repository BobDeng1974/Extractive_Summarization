by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:05 est , 10 february 2014 @entity4 astronomers have found a star 13.7 billion - years - old - the oldest ever to be discovered in our universe			1
the stellar body is thought to have formed from the materials left when the universe 's first stars began exploding			1
the discovery could help to resolve long - standing differences between observations and theories about the @entity16 billions of years ago			0
all the other elements that we see today were forged in stars , which are born in clouds of gas and dust provided by supernovae — huge stars that explode at the end of their life			0
this endless recycling process has yielded an intriguing tool for astrophysicists			0
one way of determining stellar age is iron , whose content in a star enriches with every successive birth			1
the lower the iron content in a star 's light spectrum , the older it is			1
‘ the iron level of the universe increases with time as successive generations of stars form and die , ’ said dr @entity51			1
‘ we can use the iron abundance of a star as a qualitative “ clock ” telling us when the star was formed			1
according to the researchers , the ancient star is about 6,000 light years from @entity63 - relatively close in astronomical terms			1
after 11 years of searching , the star was discovered using the @entity67 telescope at the @entity68 near @entity69 in northern @entity70			0
the telescope is being used to search for ancient stars as part of a project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky			0
‘ this star was formed shortly after the @entity16 13.7 billion years ago , ’ said dr @entity51 , lead researcher at the @entity78			1
‘ it 's giving us insight into our fundamental place in the universe			0
what we 're seeing is the origin of where all the material around us that we need to survive came from			0
’ the @entity16 was the inception of the universe , he said , and gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen , helium , and a trace			0

‘ we can use the iron abundance of a star as a qualitative “ clock ” telling us when the star was formed			2
‘ in the case of the star we have announced , the amount of iron present is less than one millionth that of the sun and a factor of at least 60 times less than any other known star			1

this is the first time researchers have unambiguously been able to say they have identified material from the first generation of stars			0
‘ we 're now going to be able to put that piece of the jigsaw puzzle in its right place , ’ said dr @entity51			0
dr @entity51 said it was previously thought primordial stars died in extremely violent explosions that polluted huge volumes of space with iron			2
but the ancient star shows signs of pollution with lighter elements such as carbon and magnesium - with no sign of iron			1
the lack of iron changes our understanding of the early universe			0
in current @entity16 modelling , those first - generation stars should have discarded iron as well as other elements – and that should be observed in a second - generation star			1
this discovery suggests another process could be at work			0
dr @entity51 suggests these first stars have these smaller explosions , and subsequent generations have more energetic @entity197 the first generation stars had weaker explosions , they ended up consuming all their iron			1
previous sweeps of the sky have turned up four other stars with similar very low iron content , which suggests that these kinds of supernovae played a vital role in creating stars , and then galaxies , in the early universe			1
‘ a star is like an onion - it has all these layers and the heaviest material like iron is right down in the core			2
‘ the only thing to come out of it was the carbon and a little bit of magnesium from that supernova and that 's what we 're seeing today in the star that we 've discovered			2
’ previous contenders for the title of oldest star are around 13.2 billion years old — two objects described by @entity232 and @entity233 teams respectively in 2007 and 2013 .			0

@entity235 is 6,000 light years from @entity63 - relatively close in astronomical terms
it formed in wake of a ' first star ' , which had 60 times mass of our sun
scientists claim the lower the iron content in star 's spectrum , the older it is
@entity235 showed signs of pollution with elements such as carbon but not iron
this suggests first stars had smaller explosions , and subsequent generations have more energetic explosions
