by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 10 april 2013 few mothers agonise over whether their child is allowed to play in the garden , but for @entity5 , even the simplest decision could have life - and - death consequences			1
her five - year - old daughter @entity7 suffers with the rare condition @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , which compromises her immune system so much that a common cold could kill her			1
the rare condition , which affects just 60 people in the @entity14 , affects digestion , growth , immune system , bone marrow , teeth and skeletal development			1
and because a sufferer 's bone marrow does not function properly , they possess little or no immune system			1
constant risk : for @entity5 , each day involves life - and - death decisions , as her five - year - old daughter @entity7 suffers from a rare condition that compromises her immune system the disease makes @entity7 extremely prone to infection and puts her at an increased risk of developing bone marrow failure and septicaemia			1
around 30 per cent sufferers also develop acute myeloid leukaemia , one of the deadliest forms of cancer			0
‘ @entity7 could be playing outside one day , and fighting for her life the next , ’ says @entity5 , 33 , from @entity38 , @entity39			1
‘ it is worrying that she could develop leukaemia at any time , but she deserves a childhood			0
’ the disease is so rare that her parents are unsure of what @entity7 ’s life - expectancy will be			2
@entity9 is an inherited genetic disorder			2
both @entity5 , and @entity7 's father , @entity49 , carry one copy of the mutated gene , but were not aware of their genetic defect until @entity7 was diagnosed aged one			1
‘ it was a relief when she was diagnosed , ' said mrs @entity5			2
' although it was hard work at first , now we 've got the condition under control and know what symptoms to look for			0
’ happy days : despite her serious condition , which puts her at an increased risk of leukemia , @entity7 tries to enjoy a normal childhood each day @entity7 must take eight different medications and have an injection to keep the symptoms of the condition at bay			1
however , the medication means that if @entity7 did develop leukaemia , it would spread much quicker than in a normal case			1
as a result she must undergo bone marrow tests every 18 months to check for the first signs of the cancer			0
‘ we try to go on holiday or travel to see family every year - we 've been to @entity84 to see family and @entity86 , ’ adds mrs @entity5			2
when @entity7 was younger she suffered with malnutrition , recurrent infection , fatigue and thin hair ‘ i take precautions in having specialised travel insurance and always make sure our doctor is available if we need to call			0
’ when @entity7 was a baby her suffered with malnutrition , fatigue , hair loss , extremely dry , fragile skin as well as frequent infections which required hospitalisation			0
‘ doctors kept trying to tell me she was just a slow developer , but i knew it was more than that			0
‘ she was scarily ill - all she would do was scream and sleep			0
i work as a medical secretary so i was i was working or with @entity7 , i was constantly in hospital			0
i did n't see daylight for days			0
’ @entity7 is youngest person with @entity9 to possess a working pancreas			1
doctors at @entity111 ( @entity111 ) started the then three - year - old @entity7 on a pancreatic supplement called @entity113 , but after six months of taking the medicine , @entity7 's pancreas started working on its own			1
@entity7 's nine - year - old sister @entity117 is a bone marrow match for her , should she need it usually children with the condition do n't possess a functioning pancreas until the age of seven , if at all			1
and because this was so extraordinary , @entity111 contacted the family to ask whether @entity7 could participate in research to use at the @entity9 conference in @entity127			2
‘ doctors want to trial her off the jab because they do n't know the long - term effects [ of the medication ] , but she develops symptoms almost straight away if she misses one , ’ explains mrs @entity5			0
‘ it 's very worrying but @entity7 is very brave			2
' the family know that their nine - year - old daughter @entity117 is a bone marrow match for @entity7 , but if @entity7 underwent the transplant now there would be a higher chance of rejection			2
‘ she could go into bone marrow failure tomorrow , but we ca n't keep her wrapped in cotton wool , ’ says @entity5			0
‘ she needs to get out and be a normal child			0
' @entity7 's cousin @entity147 is running the @entity148 in april for @entity111			1
to sponsor @entity147 go to @entity149 .			0

@entity7 , 5 , has a rare condition that means she has barely any immune system
@entity9 affects one child in a million , or 60 in the @entity14
condition affects digestion , growth and the immune system
but @entity7 's mother @entity5 wants her daughter to enjoy a normal childhood
