by @entity0 @entity2 director @entity1 expresses disbelief that a poster was designed without his approval featuring the movie â€™s heroes jumping out of an exploding building under a release date of 9/11			1
@entity1 is unimpressed with the blunder @entity1 said he was just as upset about the controversial poster shared on @entity14 's @entity13 page as the fans were and he made sure he let the studio executives know			2

one of the @entity13 replies , posted by user @ @entity83 said : ' so who 's getting fired for this poster art ? september 11 ? exploding buildings ? people falling out of them ? le sigh '			1
another message by @ @entity89 added : ' guys			0
sept 11 and exploding buildings is a bad look okay ' , while a third tweet , by @ yilmaz16 , said : ' really 9/11 ? jumping out of an exploding building ? ' @entity14 has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster , and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release			2
advice : the reason the poster proved controversial was due to the unfortunate release date of september 11 and the use of an exploding building to promote the film anger : the poster was shared on @entity26 's @entity13 page last night , and immediately drew dozens of negative comments from angry film fans outrage : @entity14 has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster , and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release resemblance : the poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks ( pictured ) , which killed 2,996 people in 2001 after @entity123 's famous @entity122 were struck by two aircraft coming up to 13 years ago , there was a period of between one and two hours before they collapsed during which dozens if not hundreds of people were seen leaping and falling to their deaths from the burning buildings			1
out of the 2,996 people killed in the four coordinated attacks , 11 of them were @entity70 citizens			0
as yet @entity14 has issued no statement or apology about the controversial poster , nor has it made any explanation of the decision to release the new film on the anniversary of the attacks .			1

director @entity1 *insists* he did not give final approval for the poster to promote the @entity2 film in @entity26
the film is released on september 11
official poster promoting release evokes *memories* of 9/11 terror attacks
heroes are seen falling from a *skyscraper* as it explodes behind them
@entity13 users described the promotion as ' bad taste ' due to release date being on 13th anniversary of 9/11 terror attacks that claimed 2,996 lives
@entity26 has since issued an apology for the *distasteful* poster
' we are deeply sorry to have used that artwork , ' the studio 's statement said
