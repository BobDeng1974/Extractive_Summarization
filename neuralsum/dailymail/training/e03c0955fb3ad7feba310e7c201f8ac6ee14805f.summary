by @entity0 published : 17:27 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 29 july 2013 firms holding lucrative @entity4 contracts hired detective agencies accused of stealing private information , it emerged last night			1
it means the ‘ secret hacking scandal ’ has now reached the doors of @entity9			0
last week , it emerged the country ’s top crime - fighting agency had drawn up a list of 102 firms and individuals who employed corrupt private investigators			1
it has not been made public but the @entity20 understands that , among the 102 , are at least two big businesses paid to work for @entity9 departments			1
police hold a second list containing a further 200 names , suggesting this may be only the tip of the iceberg			0
scrutiny : pressure is mounting on the @entity31 to reveal the names of the law firms pressure is mounting on the @entity31 to reveal the names of the law firms , insurers , banks and other big firms who used the services of the rogue private eyes			1
@entity31 has handed the original list of 102 names to the @entity44 but is insisting it remain confidential			2
@entity45 want to find ways of publishing it , and will meet within weeks to discuss whether to use parliamentary privilege			1
yesterday , committee chairman @entity49 said the public are ‘ left impotent in their judgment ’ without the names of the firms involved , which are known to include a @entity57 company and global financial institutions			2
mps , including @entity49 , want to find ways of publishing the list he has written to several regulators to ask for clarification on what guidelines , if any , they issue to organisations in their industry on the use of private investigators			0
they include the @entity70 , accountancy watchdog the @entity71 , the @entity72 and the @entity73			0
as pressure mounts on @entity31 to publish the list , ministers will face demands to investigate the ties between the firms named in it and government departments			1
the @entity31 report was handed to ministers in 2008			0
it could prove hugely embarrassing if officials in sensitive departments have been oblivious to the fact they were handing taxpayers ’ money to lawyers or other firms on the list			1
last night @entity93 mp @entity92 , a senior member of the @entity44 , wrote to the @entity94 calling for an audit of @entity4 ’s dealings with the companies identified by @entity31			0
in a letter to cabinet office minister @entity99 , he said reports have suggested the @entity31 list contains the names of law firms and other large organisations			2
mr @entity92 wrote : ‘ it could turn out to be the case that such firms and organisations on the list of clients of these private investigators have provided , and continue to provide , services to the government			1
‘ in these circumstances , could i ask you what steps have been taken to ascertain if such firms and organisations have provided any services to the government			1
‘ if they have , what steps have been taken to ascertain if such services have involved the use of these private investigators ? ’ police have been criticised for trying to suppress the contents of the @entity31 list , effectively granting anonymity to the blue - chip companies on it			0
@entity31 says there is no proof the firms knew the detectives they employed were acting unlawfully			2
but critics say the police response contrasts starkly with their treatment of the media while investigating phone hacking , when journalists were arrested in dawn raids on their homes			0
home secretary @entity140 is expected to announce proposals this week that will require private detectives to have a licence to operate			0
anyone found guilty of hacking or blagging – posing as someone to obtain personal information – would be barred .			0
