by @entity1 reporter published : 04:06 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 12:15 est , 17 september 2012 a woman whose mother threw her in a pile of burning trash minutes after she was born has finally come face - to - face with the woman who nearly ended her life			1
@entity10 , who is now 41 years old and a mother herself , survived horrific third and fourth - degree burns that covered 70 per cent of her body			1
she was born to a 16 - year - old mother who did n't know she was pregnant until she gave birth to @entity10 in the bathroom of her @entity18 home			1
then and now : just minutes after she was born in 1971 , @entity10 was thrown in a burning pile of trash and has since undergone more than 200 surgeries to treat her life - threatening burns she was discovered by her grandfather who thought he heard a crying kitten			1
when he looked in the backyard , he found that it was a newborn baby , wrapped in newspapers in a pile of burning trash			1
the burns were so bad her race was not immediately clear			0
the @entity32 tells the story of how @entity10 , known at the time as ' baby girl x ' , was treated and spent more than two decades in and out of @entity35 which specializes in treating burn victims			2
@entity10 was adopted by @entity39 's burn technician @entity37 and her husband after they spent a year as the young girl 's foster parents			2
at the age of 5 , @entity10 became curious about why she was being teased by her classmates about her burns			1
mrs @entity37 and her husband decided to explain the issue in the simplest of terms , saying that she used to have a bad mama who burned her but now she has a good mama who wo n't			0
as time passed , that served as sufficient explanation for @entity10 , who was more focused on getting through her 200 surgeries and her schooling			1
when she was 21 , @entity10 decided that she was done with having surgery			2
healing : @entity10 was adopted by a burn technician who worked with her at a specialty hospital where she was treated for 22 years ' i 'm all right with myself , ' she told @entity63			2
' at some time in your life you have to be at ease with your mind on how you 're going to look , and this is how i 'm going to look			0
' in 2009 , when @entity39 's announced a significant staff cut , @entity10 told @entity70 13 that the hospital workers made her feel like she was at home during her 22 years as a patient , and that they helped her come to terms with what happened			0
' i did n't look like this before and i know i did n't i had to get burned to look like this and i accept that			0
they did a wonderful job with me , ' she said at the time			0
@entity10 has since reconnected with both her biological mother and father , who was 19 and living in @entity83 at the time of @entity10 's birth			1
growing up : @entity10 learned she was adopted at age five , but it was n't until this may that she finally met with her biological mother face - to - face , though she still wo n't answer why she threw her in the trash in 2006 , @entity10 spoke to her biological father for the first time			1
that phone call was the first time that her father learned that @entity10 existed			0
just this may , @entity10 took the biggest step towards resolution by visiting the family home where she was found burning in the backyard pile of trash			1
her biological mother and father , who have since married and had two other children , gave her a tour of the house but one room the skipped was the bathroom where @entity10 was born			2
' i did n't want to face the fact that this is where i was born and nobody took my life seriously			0
i was born in this bathroom , and the next thing you know i was burned up , ' she said			0
during the visit , she and her mother exchanged glances and pleasantries but the looming question went unanswered : @entity10 has asked her mother several times what happened on the day of her birth , but her mother has never answered			2
in that effort , @entity10 went into social services after completing her undergraduate and master 's degrees and now works as an adoptions caseworker in @entity124			0
' i did n't get the closure , but i would love for the other kids who came behind me to get the closure , ' @entity10 told @entity63 .			0

@entity10 was found wrapped in newspaper in a burning trash pile after her *teenage* mother *panicked*
suffered third and fourth degree burns on 70 per cent of her body
had more than 200 operations to treat her skin
