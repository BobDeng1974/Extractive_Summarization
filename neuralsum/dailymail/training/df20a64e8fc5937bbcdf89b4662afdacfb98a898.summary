by @entity0 published : 13:47 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 14:42 est , 17 september 2013 @entity1 was last night embroiled in a race row , accused of failing to use ‘ models of colour ’ in her fashion shows			1
the former @entity7 featured twice on a list of designers compiled by supermodels @entity11 and @entity12 who they claim are ‘ guilty of this racist act ’			1
mrs @entity1 ’s eponymous main line was named , as well as her @entity1 , @entity1 diffusion line			2
other high - profile names listed include @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity11 ( @entity25 ) has joined forces with @entity12 ( r ) to highlight the lack of models of colour currently taking to the catwalk mrs @entity1 unveiled both her collections at @entity32 last week			1
her main line catwalk show , attended by husband @entity34 and daughter @entity35 , appeared to involve only one non-white model , while photos of her diffusion line featured just two white models			0
@entity11 , who is married to @entity40 , and miss @entity12 have joined forces with former model turned campaigner @entity43 to create the @entity44 , which aims to highlight racial prejudices in the fashion industry			0
in an open letter to the governing bodies of the fashion industries in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , the trio wrote : ‘ eyes are on an industry that season after season watches design houses consistently use one or no models of colour			2
no matter the intention , the result is racism			0
both @entity11 and @entity12 - pictured here in 2001 - say that there were more black models on the catwalk when they were in their hey day of modelling in the 70s ' not accepting another based on the colour of their skin is clearly beyond “ aesthetic ” when it is consistent with the designer ’s brand			1
' whether it ’s the decision of the designer , stylist or casting director , that decision to use basically all white models , reveals a trait that is unbecoming to modern society			0
‘ it can no longer be accepted , or confused by the use of an @entity87 model			0
as of last season , below are the fashion houses guilty of this racist act			2
’ a group of fashion professionals issued an open letter to @entity32 councils listing the designers that they said used only one or no black models in last season 's runway shows , including @entity1 the letter goes on to list both men ’s and womenswear labels			1
last night miss @entity12 appeared on @entity104 to appeal for change in the industry			0
she said : ‘ what we are asking for is that you are based on your talent , on your beauty ... not on the colour of your skin			0
’ when asked if she was accusing the industry of being racist , miss @entity12 said : ‘ i ’m saying the act of not choosing models of colour , is racist			1
' we ’re not calling them racist , we ’re saying the act was racist			2
’ a spokesman for mrs @entity1 declined to comment on the open letter last night .			0

supermodels want to see more black models on runway
say there were far more in the 1970 's when they started out
both *maintain* that the ' act ' of not choosing black models is racist , rather than designers themselves
@entity19 , @entity24 and @entity1 are called out as having used ' one or no models of colour ' last season
