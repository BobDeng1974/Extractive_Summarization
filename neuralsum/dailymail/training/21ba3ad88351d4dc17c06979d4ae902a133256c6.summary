actress @entity8 claims orgasmic meditation , or ' @entity10 ' enables her to be more sensitive - both physically and emotionally - appreciate men and experience multiple orgasms in a day			1
@entity13 is taught in ' orgasmic meditation centres ' called @entity15 by long - time practitioner and founder @entity17			1
it is thought that one in 10 women never reach orgasm but ms @entity33 is not one of them			1

she told @entity43 : ' i was already in a place of bliss - i had been doing sit down meditation for 20 years but [ @entity10 ] opened up my ability to sense more and more subtle things and my appreciation for men			0
' @entity13 is a 15 - minute practice between two people where both people focus all their attention on the techniques used and sensations created when bringing a female to orgasm			2
in a video of a class , one ' student ' called @entity62 said she was told at the age of 25 that she could not orgasm but disproved the diagnosis having attended orgasmic meditation classes			2
she said : ' i felt a moment of electricity and thought that 's what it feels like to be a woman - to be that safe and comfortable with another human being			0
' ms @entity17 said the idea of the practice is similar to @entity79 sex , which aims is to extend the peak and like conventional meditation , oming affects the same parts of the human brain			1
while it is possible to ' @entity10 ' individually or in private , @entity15 controversially organises ' om circles ' , which is the group practice of orgasmic meditation			1
the website says partners can set up a ' nest ' and have a 15 minute oming session before sharing their experiences			0
dr @entity94 , an associate researcher at a @entity95 who studies orgasms , said : ' the same parts of the brain that are activated during deep meditative states get activated during orgasm			0

@entity112 is pictured who said she was told at the age of 25 that she could not orgasm but has since mastered ' oming '			0
@entity17 , founding or orgasmic meditation centres , believes orgasm fundamentally roots the capacity for connection between people she said : ' the experience that i had was everything that i had in sitting medication ; cosmic connection , bliss , all of those things			1
' she claimed that it was the most profound human connection she had ever experienced			0
while ms @entity17 accepts that the idea of @entity134 and @entity135 classes might seem strange to many people , she said that while yoga was unusual in the @entity139 30 years ago , it is now common and orgasmic meditation could become usual activities too			1
