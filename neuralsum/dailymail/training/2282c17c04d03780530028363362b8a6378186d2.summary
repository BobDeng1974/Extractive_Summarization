shocking : @entity0 has revealed @entity2 's bombshell confession in his explosive new memoir it 's a devastating indictment of the @entity6 leader by the man who made him an mp			1
fallout , the forthcoming book by @entity0 , a former @entity6 mayor of @entity10 , serialised here , reveals a portrait of the young @entity2 that would be funny were it not so shocking			1
for in nine and half weeks between march and may 2005 , when the @entity0 family took @entity2 into their home and orchestrated his election as mp for @entity20 , we see the future leader almost set himself alight , buy a prayer mat to cover scorch marks to his office carpet and be out - negotiated by the @entity25 ’ three young children			1
but amid the farce there is a bombshell confession : @entity2 tells @entity0 that @entity30 backed a snap general election in 2007 because ‘ the economy is going to fall off a cliff and this is our best chance of winning an election ’			1
it is a revelation that @entity0 has no doubt will infuriate the @entity6 high command , but last night he vowed to face down any attempt by ‘ @entity6 attack dogs ’ to undermine his explosive revelations			2
@entity0 said he expected @entity2 ’s allies to condemn him for revealing the private conversations			2
but he had no regrets about speaking out			0
‘ people are entitled to know the truth about a man who wants to be prime minister , ’ he said			0
‘ my partner @entity49 and i know him better than most @entity51 – he lived with us and we made him an mp			0
‘ we also know that he can not be trusted			0
in 2007 , he told both of us in our sitting room that the economy was going to “ fall off a cliff ” a year before it did – and that @entity6 had cynically planned an early general election for that reason			2
on the stump : @entity2 and @entity0 meet people in @entity10 after his selection as @entity6 candidate in 2005 ‘ @entity6 attack dogs may try to deny it – just like they did when in 2008 @entity64 was chancellor and said the crash was coming			1
but they are wasting their time			0
@entity49 was present with me when @entity2 said it and she has been a card - carrying member of the party since she was 18			0
’ @entity0 , 52 , was feted by @entity69 and @entity70 after he rescued the last @entity72 ’s flagship scheme to introduce @entity73 - style directly elected mayors			0
@entity69 believed they would root out town hall corruption – and nowhere was it worse than @entity6 - run @entity10			2
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , more than 20 councillors were convicted of fraud and half a dozen were jailed in the ‘ @entity10 ’ scandal , one of the widest - reaching incidents of town hall corruption in @entity86 history			2
feted : mr @entity0 , left , local government minister @entity87 and @entity69 at a town hall reform summit in 2006 in 2002 , former rugby league player winter stood for election as mayor on an anti-corruption manifesto – and won			2
he was invited to @entity93 and sat next to @entity69 at a @entity95 - style summit to reform local government			0
in march 2005 , then chancellor @entity70 asked him to help @entity2 , his chief economic adviser , win @entity20 when the sitting mp fell ill. at a secret meeting in the @entity98 , @entity0 promised @entity70 he would secure the safe @entity6 seat for @entity2			1
during the campaign , @entity2 moved in with the @entity0 family and used their home as his base for nine and a half weeks			1
@entity2 won with @entity0 ’s help , going on to become @entity6 leader five years later			1
having been re-elected as mayor , @entity0 left the @entity6 and then stepped down in 2009 due to renewed infighting and a series of social services scandals in which seven children known to the council died within three years			1
family : @entity0 , with his wife @entity114 , and children , left to right , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 in 1999 an @entity120 report said @entity6 councillors spent more time ‘ pursuing long - term political antagonisms ’ than improving services			1
the book @entity0 has now written tells how he was recruited by @entity6 chiefs to end corruption and feuding in @entity10 – and his success in boosting the town ’s economic growth with a dynamic regeneration portfolio			1
the second half tells the story of his falling out with @entity6 as @entity0 ’s enemies ‘ tried to destroy me despite all my loyalty to the party – and to @entity2 ’			1
a day after their first phone call on march 2 , 2005 , @entity2 moved in with mr @entity0 , his partner @entity138 and their three children at their home in @entity10			1
he lived there for a month and carried on using the office in their garden until the 2005 general election on may 5			0
he was elected the mp for @entity20 and said farewell two days later , posting a ‘ how @entity146 ’ thank - you note through @entity0 ’s letterbox			0
campaign base : this is where @entity2 worked - and nearly poisoned himself - while campaigning to become an mp it brought an end to 66 days – nearly nine and half weeks – spent as a temporary member of mr @entity0 ’s politically extended family			1
at the time , the couple ’s children , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , were aged ten , 11 and 14 respectively			0
@entity2 slept in the bottom bunk in @entity117 ’s @entity161 - themed bedroom , with @entity117 moving to another room			0
ms @entity138 then converted the children ’s yellow and green playroom into a bedroom for their special guest			0
the couple also bought him a wardrobe and a bed			0
after a month , @entity2 rented a house nearby to comply with election rules , but he continued to use mr @entity0 ’s garden office as his campaign base .			2
