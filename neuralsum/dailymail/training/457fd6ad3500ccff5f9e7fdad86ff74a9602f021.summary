about three million parents over the age of 50 have adult children living with them , a survey has found but the report from @entity22 , the old age experts , also raised fears about the pressure on millions of parents who never thought their children would still be living at home			1
many complain they are having to raid their savings due to the unexpected expense of paying for their children when they assumed they would be financially independent			0
and more than half of the failed fledglings had briefly moved out at one point before deciding to return to their childhood home			2
typically , they came back after graduating from university , splitting up with a partner or when they need to save for a deposit			0
the report was based on a poll of nearly 10,500 parents over the age of 50			1
it found the number of ‘ failed fledglings ’ is highest in @entity48 , where 19 per cent still have grown - up children living at home			1
the pressure on grown - up children , who can not afford to buy , is made worse by the fact that the cost of renting is close to a record high however this dropped to 12 per cent in the @entity58 and @entity59 – the lowest regional scores			1
the survey comes as the average asking price in the capital has gone over £ 500,000 for the first time			0
with an average full - time salary of around £ 26,500 , this means only the rich and the very well - paid can afford to buy in the capital , unless they are given money by their parents			1
the pressure on the grown - up children , many of whom are desperate not to live with their parents , is made worse by the fact that the cost of renting is close to a record high			1
the average rent in @entity77 and @entity78 has jumped to £ 736 a month – a rise of 3.9 per cent over the last year			2
but workers have seen average pay rises of just 0.8 per cent			0
@entity82 , chief executive of @entity83 , the financial services division of @entity22 , said : ‘ with so many children choosing to stay at home longer , it just proves that a parent ’s work is never quite done			1

the guide is aimed at helping parents with graduates living at home			2
it includes tips about how to get rid of children who you would prefer to have moved out			0
it says being ‘ too supportive ’ is a mistake			0
‘ sometimes , it really is necessary to show tough love			0
if you are making life too comfortable at home , why would they get a job ? the grown - up children return home after graduating from university , splitting up with a partner or when they needed to save for a deposit ‘ if you are providing free board and lodgings , a well - stocked fridge , washing and ironing done , plus an allowance , there ’s not much drive there			2
so cut back to help increase their motivation			0
’ @entity141 , from the first - time buyer campaign group @entity142 , said : ‘ living with your parents is an obvious way to avoid sky - high rents , but it is a big sacrifice in terms of independently getting on with your adult life			0
