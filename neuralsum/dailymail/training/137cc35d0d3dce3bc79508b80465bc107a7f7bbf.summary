' i grabbed the house and tried to put the fire out			0
' @entity12 and his daughter , @entity20 , who has called for photoelectric smoke alarms to be mandatory in homes across @entity8 the grave sites of the @entity64 who died three years ago in @entity8 's deadliest house fire mr @entity12 's son - in - law , @entity9 , described the scene as ' very dark ' and ' very hot ' with smoke so thick he could not see into the house			1
mr @entity9 called out his wife 's and children 's names to see if they were inside but when there was no answer he jumped out the window , thinking they had made their escapes			1
' i tried to come back to the house but the fire was everywhere , ' he said			0
since his family 's death , mr @entity9 arrives at the cemetery where they are buried every morning at 6am to sit for several hours at their grave sites			2
@entity9 is embraced by a friend or relative on the day he lost his family at @entity1 here @entity9 is comforted by friends after collapsing in the street in front of photographs the @entity94 on august 24 , 2011 as friends and family of the victims await news of their loved ones ' at the cemetery i sitting there and cry and keep talking to them			1
i tell them : " i know you can hear me but i ca n't hear you " , ' he said			0
@entity106 lost her daughter , mother , sister , aunt , two nieces and five cousins that august night			2
she has pleaded with authorities to make photo - electric smoke alarms a requirement in all homes			1
' i want everybody to purchase photo - electric smoke alarms to be installed in every single home and to be made mandatory in @entity8 and hopefully the world , ' ms @entity24 urged people through tears			1
' it will save a lot of lives			0
i just to hope to @entity124 nobody goes through what we went through			0
' fire safety experts are calling for photoelectric smoke alarms to be made mandatory in households @entity132 assistant fire commissioner @entity131 ( left ) and fire safety expert @entity130 ( right ) say photoelectric smoke alarms are more effective but @entity8 @entity135 's @entity134 believes there is not enough evidence to make the change and fire safety expert @entity130 agrees and has been pushing the cause for nearly a decade			1
in a fire demonstration on 60 minutes where a soldering iron is used to simulate a still - burning cigarette setting a couch alight , it takes seven minutes for a photoelectric smoke alarm to detect the smoke			1
but this is not the case with a ionic one			0
even after reporter @entity152 and @entity132 assistant fire commissioner @entity131 - who was running the demonstration - were evacuated after 15 minutes when fumes became too ' toxic ' , the ionic smoke alarm remained silent			2
photoelectric smoke alarms were made mandatory in @entity132 in november 2011			1
mr @entity131 said there was enough evidence to persuade emergency service authorities to make the change permanent			0
he said it was required in every residence in the state , including demountables , caravans , transportables and safari - style tents			0
asked whether or not the move had been effective , mr @entity131 said it was ' early days yet but anything to save lives			0
in a fire simulation on @entity171 , photoelectric smoke alarms were more react @entity130 wants to see this requirement imposed in every state in @entity8 , saying it would drive down numbers of house fire deaths , which is 50 to 150 people a year			1
' typically people who die in house fires die while they ’re asleep from fires that develop from a long - smouldering phase , which could be an electrical fault , could be a cigarette on a couch , could be clothes in a dryer and the dryer has malfunctioned , ' mr @entity130 said			0
' the time when the occupants need to get the warning [ is ] before the house fills with smoke			0
' ionic alarms were installed inside the home the @entity64 and @entity193 died in , and had been turned off because they had gone off at the wrong times			2
but mr @entity130 said there was ' no doubt ' in his mind that if a photoelectric alarm instead it would not have been disconnected			0
' there ’s no doubt in my mind if [ the @entity64 and @entity203 ] had a photoelectric smoke alarm in that home they would not have been disconnected ... and would have given precious minutes of advanced notice of a fire , ' he said			1
mr @entity130 said people could prevent a tragedy such as the @entity1 fire from happening again by buying a four - pack of photoelectric smoke alarms from the hardware store for $ 49			1
but the @entity212 - who decided the smoke alarm requirements of homes - are hesitant to make photoelectrics mandatory in households , despite it being so for commercial buildings , including hospitals , shopping centres and hotels			2
' it has not been demonstrated to the board ’s satisfaction that one performs better in all circumstances than the other , ' the board 's @entity134 told 60 minutes			0
' ultimately if there is an overwhelming body of evidence that that 's the case then the board would obviously give that serious consideration but it wo n't be reflected as mandating necessarily a particular product			0

the @entity1 fire happened south of @entity19 on august 24 , 2011
@entity9 lost his wife and five children in the devastating fire
while his father - in - law @entity240 lost his wife , three granddaughters and niece
according to a fire safety expert , photoelectric smoke alarms are more effective than ionic ones
it costs only $ 49 to buy a packet of four photoelectric smoke alarms at the hardware store
