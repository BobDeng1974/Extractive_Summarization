@entity0 is closing in on a return to @entity3 football as part of a swap deal involving @entity8 misfit @entity6			1
@entity9 has been working on a deal to end @entity6 ’s nightmare at the @entity12 by allowing him to leave the club and move to @entity16 side @entity14 as part of a swoop for @entity0			1
@entity9 is desperate to add firepower to @entity8 ’s strike force and @entity0 has pedigree in the @entity22 after spells at @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			2
@entity27 nonchalantly trots away after giving @entity28 during their 1 - 0 victory at @entity8 @entity0 is closing in on a return to @entity3 football with a move to @entity8 @entity0 ( right ) has been training with former club @entity25 and wants to return from the @entity16 @entity8 misfit @entity6 ( right ) , pictured against @entity32 in november , could move the opposite way 1 - @entity8 have won just once at the @entity12 all season and have the worst home record ( nine points ) in the @entity22			1
the biggest stumbling block to @entity0 ’s return remains his £ 70,000 - a - week wages but the potential to trade @entity6 has softened the financial burden for the @entity8			1
@entity14 had been holding out for a £ 6million transfer fee for the former @entity44 striker but are tempted by a straight swap provided @entity8 take on his massive wages			2
@entity0 , 32 , has been training with @entity25 ’s under 21 development squad to keep fit recently and , although there is no prospect of a deal at @entity25 , he has no intention of heading back to @entity53 for the start of the @entity16 season in march			0
@entity27 poked beyond @entity56 to score his first goal since moving to the @entity22 @entity59 grabs hold of @entity27 as the @entity28 players rush to congratulate the goalscorer how @entity9 could have done with the former @entity44 striker in his ranks on saturday as @entity28 coasted to victory without their own talisman			1
@entity66 did not want to expose @entity67 to the coarse climes of the @entity69 , where temperatures barely touched three degrees @entity71 and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium			0
instead , the player he believes will fire @entity28 to the top four was in @entity77 , relaxing and posting selfies amid the 30 - dgree @entity71 surrounds of his ‘ winter break ’			0
@entity81 was given his marching orders four minutes after half - time for two bookings @entity81 tripped can as he marauded down the right into space to pick up his second yellow card @entity66 said : ‘ he will come back now and mentally it will freshen him up			0
it is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs			0
’ the only surprise at the @entity12 was that @entity28 did not add to @entity27 ’s ninth - minute opener , a close - range poke after a forceful run into the penalty area			1
@entity8 , in comparison , lacked energy and invention , although they were arguably better after @entity81 was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on @entity59 , but they never truly threatened parity			0
former @entity105 winger @entity104 smashed the bar in the second half for @entity8 @entity27 later struck the crossbar with this volley as @entity28 took control of the game in the @entity69			2
