' one was taller than the others , ' remembers 74 - year - old @entity1 , @entity2			1
' i asked him who he was			2
he laughed and said , " yo soy @entity6			2
" ' it was the first time @entity11 clapped eyes on the @entity6 dictator but it certainly was n't the last			1
just one year after the first fateful meeting , @entity11 was living in @entity15 as his mistress			2
but her presence there did n't go unnoticed , not least by the @entity19 , who in 1960 recruited her to kill @entity8 using poison pills concealed in her face cream			1
fateful : @entity11 and @entity8 pictured at their first meeting aboard the @entity28 cruise ship in @entity15 harbour so how did @entity11 , the daughter of a @entity33 @entity32 cruise liner captain , go to from lover to would - be killer in such a short space of time ? her story began on the 28th february 1959 when her father 's cruise ship , the @entity28 , on which she also worked , dropped anchor in @entity15 harbour			1
as liner dropped anchor , a launch crammed with uniformed men hurtled towards them , among them , fatefully , @entity8			1
' he was 33 , with sparkling eyes , ' she remembers , speaking in an interview recorded for @entity53 documentary , @entity52			2
' and that was it			2
i was lost in love			2
' on her return to @entity1 a few days later , she found herself bombarded with calls and invitations to return to @entity6 from the dictator			2
she obliged and , within days , was installed in @entity8 's penthouse apartment on the 74th floor of the @entity65			1
after her affair with @entity8 ended , she went on to have a child with @entity69 's @entity68 revolutionaries : @entity8 of @entity6 with @entity72 guerrilla leader @entity71 two months later , she discovered - to her delight - that she was pregnant			1
but her happiness was n't to last			2
drinking a glass of milk one day while heavily pregnant , she suddenly blacked out and came to a few hours later to find herself seriously ill - and without her baby			0
so ill did she become , she was flown home to @entity1 for treatment			0
once there , she was visited by the @entity19 who revealed that @entity8 had arranged for her to be given a late term abortion			1
' i did n't believe it , ' she told the @entity86			0
' but they did a good job of brainwashing me , telling me that he did this to me			0
' so heartbroken , she was willing to believe agents when they informed her that @entity8 was not just a threat to @entity32 , but intimidatingly dangerous as well			1
@entity11 remembers : ' they said , " we want you to take him out "			0
' she agreed and in january 1960 , she travelled to @entity99 to meet @entity100 ; a @entity19 double - agent who handed her a pot of poison pills			1
her role was simple : drop one in @entity8 's drink and escape unscathed			1
frightened she would be discovered by @entity6 customs , @entity11 resorted to one more subterfuge and hid the pills inside her pot of cold cream			0
resigned : @entity8 , who stepped down as president in 2008 , and @entity11 never saw each other again as she knew him : @entity8 pictured at a meeting in @entity15 in 1959 - the same year he met @entity11 it was a decision that would prove fateful			1
back once more in @entity8 's @entity15 penthouse , she attempted to slip the pills into a glass of water but was foiled by the clinging cream			1
' i tried to wipe it off , but i could n't , ' she remembers			0
' i panicked and tried to flush them down the loo but they would n't go down			0
' the dictator had got wind of the plot and @entity11 was terrified			2
' he took his gun out of its holster , ' she says			0
' i thought he was going to shoot me , but he gave me the gun and asked , " did you come to kill me ? " ' then he took a puff on his cigar and closed his eyes			0
he made himself vulnerable because he knew i could n't do it			0
he still loved me and i still loved him			0
' and he was right			0
@entity11 ejected the bullets and fell into his arms			0
but her incredible story still was n't over			0
fearing the @entity19 would kill her if she attempted to remain with @entity8 , she returned to @entity99 and never saw her erstwhile lover again			1
although she would later have an affair with another dictator , @entity69 's @entity68 with whom she had a daughter , and another relationship that resulted in a son , @entity11 ' affection for @entity8 , now 87 , remains undiminished			1
' the moment i saw the outline of the island from the plane , i knew i could n't do it , ' she says			0
' i have a reputation as an assassin but would n't kill a bug			0
' @entity2 appears in @entity52 , @entity53 from february 27th			1

@entity2 , now 74 , is the @entity33 former lover of @entity8
became his mistress in 1959 when she was just 20 years old
recruited by the @entity19 to murder the dictator in 1960 using poison
