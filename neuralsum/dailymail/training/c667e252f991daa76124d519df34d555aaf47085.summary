@entity0 practises his dribble in the back - garden ice rink his godfather had built for him @entity0 longed to be an ace at ice hockey , but struggled to get to his local rink to practise			1
so his godfather decided to give the ten - year - old an early @entity9 present – by building a private rink of his own			1
@entity11 spent £ 15,000 putting the 5m ( 16ft ) by 11m ( 36ft ) practice area in the garden of @entity0 ’s home			1
mr @entity11 , 61 , a sales director of a plastics company , used a large gazebo to hide the construction work and told his godson they were building a garage			0
when it was ready they blindfolded @entity0 before revealing the surprise			1
mr @entity11 said : ‘ when we took it off , his face was a picture			0
he could n’t grasp what he was seeing at first			0
he kept repeating , “ i ’ve got my own private ice rink , have n’t i ” ? ' there were tears in his eyes as he tried to take it all in			1
until then , did n’t have a clue it was even possible			0
' now when he has friends over , they do n’t spend time on the @entity39			0
they get out on the ice and have a skate on the rink , because you can walk straight out onto it from the house			2
' now the @entity9 holidays have arrived , we will really be making the most of it			0
' mr @entity11 said he was inspired to build the rink by his own son who is bound to a wheelchair because of muscle dystrophy			2
' having a son in a wheelchair has made me realise that you have to do what you can for kids while you are here			0
' once today is gone , it will never come back			2
i simply get a buzz out of seeing kids and smiling while they are being so active			0
i ’m happy if @entity0 and his friends are happy , ' he added			2
the all - weather rink is made of specially treated white plastic tiles and is ' 85 per cent ' like skating on ice , the family said			1
and having a practice area at his home in @entity71 , @entity72 , has already paid off for @entity0 , who plays for the @entity73			1
his skating skills have improved so much he has been picked for several team trials			0
ten - year - old @entity0 and his friends have been making good use of the rink now that the school holidays have started , his godfather said @entity0 with his godfather @entity11 who said he was happy to gift him the ice rink for @entity9 mr @entity11 , who fears skating is becoming a lost skill as town centre rinks dwindle , said : ‘ now he can practise for hours after school , instead of travelling seven miles to the nearest municipal rink			1
’ another mother keen for her children to master the art of skating built her children a rink in @entity93			2
@entity94 , a special needs teacher , unveiled the back - garden rink to her three children last week			1
the 43 - year - old said : ' i drew the curtains back , and unveiled the rink			1
' as you can imagine there was a lot of screaming			0
they could n’t wait to get their skates on and get straight out onto the ice			0
’ managing director of @entity109 - based company @entity108 , which installs the small rinks in back gardens said the trend for home entertainment is growing			1
' household mini rinks are getting more popular each year , especially at christmas time when parents want to give their kids something special			0
‘ some of our customers have converted their basements , set up a mini hockey rink in their front gardens , or put just a few tiles on the decking in the yard			2
‘ they have all sorts of reasons for installing them – as unique gifts for children , somewhere to practice ice dancing , or just something fun for their kids to play on when friends pop over			0
when you have an ice rink at home , the door bell never stops ringing			1
