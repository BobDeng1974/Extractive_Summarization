by @entity0 scientists have discovered that acid could improve the prospects of successfully treating @entity5 , heart disease and stroke			0
it may seem counter-intuitive that a destructive substance could improve health , but experts from the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , said that mild acid can be used to revert cells back to a neutral state from which they can be turned into a variety of other cells			1
this is a big step forward for the science of growing organs and tissue , vital in the battle against a range of diseases including @entity5 , spinal cord injury , stroke , heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis			1
scientists believe that acid could be used in the battle against a range of diseases ( file picture ) researchers from the @entity36 found that exposing mice cells to mildly acidic conditions caused them to reset to a blank state within 30 minutes , @entity34 reports			1
experts believe that from this state any type of cell at all can be nurtured			1
@entity45 ’s professor @entity44 wrote in nature : ‘ remarkably , instead of triggering cell death or tumour growth as might be expected a new cell state emerges that exhibits an unprecedented potential for differentiation into every possible cell type			2
‘ the breakthrough means the cure for some major diseases could come from within patients			0
the acid research could be vital in the race to find a cure for @entity5 's , which affects millions of elderly people ( file picture ) professor @entity63 , chairman of regenerative medicine bioprocessing at @entity65 said : ‘ if it works in man , this could be a game changer that ultimately makes a wide range of cell therapies available using the patient ’s own cells			2
’ the research follows news that @entity77 scientists say they have written the recipe for making ethically acceptable , highly versatile stem cells in large numbers that could be banked and turned into treatments for patients who need to replace diseased , damaged and worn out body parts			0
researchers from @entity86 ’s @entity85 say they have found a way of safely removing a single , precious stem cell from an embryo and worked out how to make the lone cell grow and multiply , using a lab - made version of a protein that is found in the embryo .			0

researchers found that cells can be reverted to a blank state using acid
@entity13 experts say they can then be grown into any type of cell at all
the research is a breakthrough in the science of growing organs and tissue
