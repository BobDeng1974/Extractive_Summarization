in hindsight , we should have seen it coming			0
everything was going far too well			0
this is a club , in my lifetime and before , that has perennially shot itself in the foot			2
@entity10 ' departure is one that is already leaving us @entity13 fans wondering ' what if ' - and the season has n't even started yet			1
similarly , @entity10 ' demands - for the club to spend big on @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 - have not been met and he too is hot - footing out of @entity43			1
now , it must be said that an 11th - placed finish in the @entity21 should give a manager a far stronger mandate to get what he wants than merely a strong start to the season in the @entity51 , but the under - lying principles remain the same			1
@entity13 2010 , the consortium of @entity13 fans which saved the club from extinction just four years ago , have a clear vision			1
to rebuild @entity13 's infrastructure , which had fallen far behind the requirements of a @entity51 club , let alone a top flight club , is a vital and ongoing process , and one that must run parallel with , and not be overtaken by , spending on the playing staff			1
managers , by their nature , will often only see the short - term picture - namely , results			0
breaking up is hard to do : @entity10 ( left ) was appointed by @entity70 ( right ) but has now left the club @entity10 was achieving an @entity72 in that regard , but for a club whose top earner was on £ 10,000 - a - week when promoted just 15 months ago , to already be forking out sums of £ 10million and wages nearing £ 50,000 would be foolhardy			1
yet that is what @entity10 wanted , and you ca n't blame him			2
a manager is always going to fight his corner			0
it just so happened that his unstoppable force met an immovable object in co-chairman @entity70			0
the fractures in the relationship between the two were there from day one , in fact , they were there before then			0
at @entity93 ' unveiling the pair admitted negotiations to bring him in had been troublesome and lengthy			0
looking back now , it is clear to see why			0
@entity10 was never @entity97 's sort of manager , an old - school , finger - in - every - pie boss			1
equally , @entity70 was not @entity10 ' sort of chairman			2
he wants every decision run by him and the appointment of @entity105 as sporting director - effectively a middle man between the two - illustrates that			0
there were further differences of opinion as the season went on too , but the cracks were papered over			2
@entity113 : @entity41 , who joined @entity114 , was one of the players @entity10 wanted but was not able to approach it always felt like a short - term fix when @entity10 came in , a manager keen to rebuild his reputation and a club desperate to stay in the top flight meeting for a brief romance , not a long - term marriage			1
the fundamental differences were always going to come to a head , even if no - one saw it happening this quickly			0
in many ways , the board went against their beliefs , their mantra , in hiring @entity10			2
as baffling as @entity97 's stance may seem to some , it makes sense from a business stance - and a business is , effectively , what he is helping run			2
@entity13 were the eighth - best team in the division counting only results from when @entity10 took over in november			1
no key players left in the summer , so why fork out tens of millions when the ambitious manager may well leave at the first sniff of an opportunity higher up the table ? @entity151 was n't built in a day , and all that			0
back in the day : @entity10 masterminded @entity13 's remarkable comeback against @entity153 last season for all his popularity , and @entity10 will go into @entity164 for what he achieved in his nine months in charge , the continued side - lining of academy starlet @entity156 and record signing @entity157 , and the reluctance to bring back @entity160 from his @entity162 wilderness , did not sit well with many @entity13 fans			1
it seems likely that whoever comes in will be expected to use @entity156 and @entity157 , and perhaps have @entity170 to work with too			0
whether that trio can make up for the loss of such a talismanic figure in @entity93 , only time will tell			0
but come what may , life goes on in @entity43 , as it did when @entity30 left and , just , when @entity13 2010 saved the club			1
of course , this an eternally optimistic viewpoint , but that 's what @entity13 fans are , it 's in the fabric of the club and what has kept it going through the dark days , and will do when the season kicks off on saturday at the @entity188 and beyond			1
in the words of @entity190 : ' we go again			0
' video @entity13 and @entity10 part company			1

@entity10 left @entity13 two days before @entity21 season
he left after *disagreements* over the club 's *transfer* *policy*
@entity10 led @entity13 to an 11th place finish last season
