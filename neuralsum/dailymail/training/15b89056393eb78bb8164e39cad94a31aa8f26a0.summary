by @entity0 @entity2 makes ecstasy more lethal , new research suggests			0
@entity5 researchers found doses of @entity7 that would not be fatal in cool conditions , can kill people when taken in hot , crowded settings such as nightclubs			1
this is because the drug interferes with the body ’s ability to regulate temperature			1
even moderate doses of @entity7 can be fatal in warm environments , such as nightclubs ( file picture ) researchers at the @entity22 say some people believe @entity7 is harmless when taken in moderate doses			1
but , their new research in rats showed this is not the case in hot environments			0
‘ we know that high doses of @entity7 can sharply increase body temperature to potentially lead to organ failure or even death , ’ said dr @entity29			2
‘ however , this current study opens the possibility that even moderate doses could be deadly in certain conditions			0
’ the researchers say it is currently impossible to predict who will have an adverse reaction to a low dose of @entity7			0
however in this study , scientists gave the rats low to moderate doses that have been shown in past studies to not be fatal			0
the drug interferes with the body 's ability to regulate temperature so is dangerous in warm environments they monitored the rats to determine drug - induced changes in brain and body temperature and in the body ’s ability to cool itself through blood vessel dilation			1
when rats were alone and kept at room temperature , a moderate dose of @entity7 modestly increased brain and body temperature and moderately diminished the rats ’ ability to eliminate excessive heat			1
however , when researchers injected the same dose into rats that were either in a warmer environment or in the presence of another rat in the cage , brain temperature increased , causing death in some rats			0
‘ these results demonstrate that the use of @entity7 in certain warm , social settings could be more dangerous than commonly believed , ’ said dr @entity73 , first author on the study			2
‘ even with moderate doses , we saw drug - induced , fatal brain hyperthermia during conditions of social interaction and in warm environments			2

doses of @entity7 that are safe in cool places become dangerous in warm ones
this is because the drug interferes with the body 's ability to regulate heat
