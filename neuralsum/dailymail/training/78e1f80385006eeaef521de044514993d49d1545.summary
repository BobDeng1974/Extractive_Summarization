centre : the church building in @entity11 where ms @entity7 has run a pentecostal church for four years ms @entity7 was accused of unfairly dismissing mr @entity5 from her college centre , the @entity25 in @entity11 , after they split in 2010			1

mr @entity5 told an employment tribunal he had not been paid for lessons he gave in music and flower arranging at the centre in @entity40 , northern @entity11			1
but she claimed the former deacon had only been a volunteer			2
the employment tribunal ruled in ms @entity7 's favour after agreeing mr @entity5 had insufficient evidence to pursue his claim			1
judge @entity47 ruled there was no evidence mr @entity5 was employed by @entity25			1
although they are not divorced , the couple from @entity11 split shortly after their own wedding reception , falling out over several issues including a missing titanium cooking pot. speaking after the hearing , mr @entity5 - who had also preached at his estranged wife 's church - vowed to keep pursuing her through his solicitors			1
he said : ' she is erratic and fiery tempered - all i want is to do things to please @entity65 and do @entity65 's will			2
' she has no control over money , no idea about paying bills or anything			2
she knew i had run my own business and could look after those kind of things			0
' those lessons i gave for her cost £ 1,000 each			2
how can she say that i would volunteer to do that and close my own business rather than take a cut ? ' i could have done it myself and kept all of it , instead she claims i was willing to do it for just the petrol money			0
' i do n't preach at the church anymore , i 'm a @entity10 first , i do n't bother with titles			0
' i 'm not bitter , but if i saw her walking down the street , i 'd blank her			0
' my solicitors will be following this up			0
i can just now be happy that i can go to @entity65 knowing i told the truth			0
accusations : ms @entity7 , who founded her pentecostal church @entity96 and hosts meetings at @entity11 's @entity97 ( above ) , claimed her husband was ' manipulative and controlling ' ' how she has the cheek to get up on the altar now , knowing what she has done , is beyond me			1
i trusted her as a pastor and i was sucked in by that			2
that is what i 'm ashamed of			0
' but ms @entity7 , who founded her pentecostal church @entity107 four years ago , claimed her husband was ' manipulative and controlling '			1
she said four months after the wedding she packed her bags and left , unable to put up with his behaviour			0
' i 'm well out of it , ' she said			0
' his bombastic attitude vexed choir members			0
in the end it got very bitter			0
' he wanted £ 74,000 from me - that 's £ 1,200 a month from 2010 to now			2
he needs to realise that 60 per cent of nothing is nothing			0
' he 's been pleading " can i come back ? " ' i know he 's trying to pull a fast one			0
he was a volunteer , he was not paid because the academy was a charity and did not pay anyone			2
