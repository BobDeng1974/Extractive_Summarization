by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 06:17 est , 12 january 2014 powerful backbench critic : @entity3 fears that the @entity4 are sleepwalking to an electoral doomsday as dissatisfied voters turn to @entity7 a senior @entity9 mp has warned that the party is set to lose 50 seats at the next election , giving @entity13 the keys to @entity15			1
@entity9 grandee @entity3 claims the @entity4 are sleepwalking to an electoral doomsday , with many mps unaware they face being turfed out by voters			1
and mr @entity3 said that instead of attacking @entity7 leader @entity20 , the prime minister should be copying his policies on issues such as immigration – because grassroots @entity9 supporters back them			1
in private remarks to fellow conservatives , leading @entity26 mr @entity3 said : ‘ on present trends we are going to lose 50 seats – and most of them do n’t even realise it			1
' it has got to the ridiculous position where @entity20 is telling us what our policy on immigration should be – and he is right			2
’ if the @entity9 were to lose 50 seats , that would almost certainly result in mr @entity13 becoming prime minister			1
polling experts say that it is the switch of @entity9 voters to @entity7 that will allow @entity42 to grab key @entity9 seats in marginal constituencies			2
mr @entity3 , mp for @entity45 & @entity46 , told @entity47 last night : ‘ i have been quite open about what i believe			1
' we must reclaim control of our immigration laws so that @entity53 ministers and @entity54 can decide who enters our country , on what terms , how long they can stay and what benefits they are entitled to receive			0
‘ @entity20 says many things which many voters and many @entity9 supporters agree with			0
we should adopt them as our policies			0
’ asked if he had forecast the @entity9 would lose 50 seats , he said : ‘ if the @entity63 took place today , based on current opinion polls , yes , the @entity9 would lose seats			1
but we have every opportunity to put things right and i will be campaigning flat out for a @entity70 victory			0
’ mr @entity3 , the son of @entity71 , who served in @entity73 ’s @entity72 , is emerging as one of mr @entity70 ’s most powerful backbench @entity9 critics			1
last month he organised a letter signed by more than 90 conservative mps calling on the prime minister to push for a national veto on all current and future @entity81 laws			0
write caption here if mr @entity3 ’s forecast is correct , high - profile figures in the firing line include : environment minister @entity86 ( @entity87 & @entity88 , the second most vulnerable conservative seat ) ; @entity90 , the mp behind the @entity91 ( @entity92 , 8th most vulnerable ) ; defence minister @entity93 ( @entity94 , 9th ) ; and @entity95 ( @entity96 , 35th ) , son of former cabinet minister @entity98			2
mr @entity70 came under further attack last night from another right - wing @entity90 mp , @entity90 ( @entity101 )			0
mr @entity90 said @entity103 ’s economic policy would lead to another @entity105 - style cycle of boom and bust			2
mr @entity90 writes in today ’s @entity47 : ‘ @entity110 though the economic rebound might be , the @entity108 is making some serious mistakes			0
‘ mr @entity103 has adopted much the same monetary approach as his predecessor			0
this “ @entity115 ” economic policy means @entity53 is now more dependent on consumer spending and mortgage debt than ever before			0

tories are sleepwalking into electoral doomsday , says @entity3
he has privately told fellow @entity4 that their party could lose 50 seats
such a swing would almost certainly lead to @entity13 becoming *pm*
