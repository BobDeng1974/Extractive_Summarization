it 's every shopaholic ’s dream – a debit card that credits your account with the amount you spend instead of leaving you poorer			1
so when @entity6 realised her maestro card had become her golden ticket to free spending , she made the most of it to the tune of £ 10,000			1
but , inevitably , her luck soon ran out and once the authorities realised what was going on 42 - year - old @entity16 found herself in court charged with fraud			1
the court heard this was potentially the result of a computer glitch , or due to the fact that the shopkeeper may have been processing the payments incorrectly – causing the store to not only give away goods for free but also accidentally pay to top up the card			1
@entity16 and her ex-partner @entity21 , 43 , who had joined her in the nine - month spending spree , both pleaded guilty to fraud			1
the court heard the pair , neither of whom are believed to be in employment , visited the store so often they befriended the owner			2
pre-paid debit cards work in much the same way as regular debit cards , except when the balance reaches zero , they can not be used any more , similar to travel money cards used on holiday			1
they are often used for household expenses such as shopping because they allow users to keep accurate tabs on how much they are using			0
@entity69 , for @entity21 , told @entity70 that @entity16 was the main instigator of the fraudulent spending , although @entity21 was aware of what was going on			2
‘ it was a genuine card , ’ he said			0
‘ they do n’t understand how the money was put on it , whether it was a glitch in the system or the shopkeeper did n’t know how it worked , but once they realised , they did carry on like it was a golden ticket			0
’ prosecutor @entity85 said that once the owner of the shop , in @entity89 , @entity90 , realised what the card was doing they phoned the issuer , who had no idea why it could be happening			1
so in may last year , the owner contacted police			0
at first @entity21 did not realise what was happening , but after becoming aware of the mistake , she took advantage of the shop - owner , visiting up to seven times a day mr @entity85 added : ‘ the shopkeeper seems to be the loser in this			1
’ @entity106 , for @entity16 , told the court she regretted fraudulently using the card , and felt she had ‘ betrayed ’ the shop staff			2
judge @entity112 handed @entity16 , of @entity113 , @entity114 , a nine - month prison sentence suspended for 18 months and ordered her to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work			0
he said : ‘ this was a golden ticket and although it does n’t condone it , the fact is a machine or person made the mistake			0
‘ it does n’t forgive or excuse what you did , but you took advantage of it			0
’ drug addict @entity21 , of no fixed address , was also sentenced for burglary after breaking into @entity16 ’s neighbour ’s house for money to buy valium , shortly after he was released from prison for a previous offence			2
the court heard he took a jar of change , two laptops and some prescription pills , as well as ripping the money out of birthday cards			2
he was jailed for three years			0
judge @entity112 gave @entity16 a nine - month prison sentence suspended for 18 months at @entity70 , pictured and ordered her to do 150 hours of unpaid community work to watch the full video click here .			0
