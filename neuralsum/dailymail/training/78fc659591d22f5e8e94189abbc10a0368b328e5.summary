by @entity0 hi everyone - or should i say @entity3 ! i was in beautiful @entity4 last weekend to attend the @entity6 international beauty trade fair with my nail range , @entity8			1
here she shows you how to achieve the perfect @entity23 manicure when @entity25 and i arrived , we were amazed at the sheer size of the space			1
it truly was a true beauty lover 's paradise , with over 90,000 square metres of space dedicated to exhibitors from all corners of the beauty world : perfumery , cosmetics , beauty salons and spas , hair and of course - nails			1
mummy and i also treated ourselves to a uv gel manicure while we were at @entity6			1
although i normally do my nails myself at home , i could n't not take advantage of all the amazing treatments on offer at the event			0
i opted for a bright @entity50 blue shade while @entity25 went for a gorgeous pinky purple			0
gel manicures are super long - lasting with a high - shine finish that does n't chip , so for someone who 's always on the go like me they 're ideal			2
most beauty salons offer @entity23 gel manicures these days , but it 's actually not too difficult to do it yourself at home			1
i 'd advise investing in a decent quality @entity23 nail lamp such as the @entity64 from @entity65 ( £ 90 with gel kit )			1
if you 're on a budget , the @entity67 , £ 12.99 from @entity68 does the trick too			0
the @entity72 team at @entity0 's stand at @entity6 @entity74 how - to : 1 - @entity75 first things first , always apply a hand cream with @entity75 over the hands and nails to protect the skin			1
2 - prepare the nails then move on to preparing the nails			2
it 's vital you make sure your nails are in tip - top condition before applying any kind of polish - in particular if you 're using a uv lamp - this ensures your nails stay strong and healthy , as well as making your manicure look flawless			1
get rid of any residue or leftover nail polish on and around the nails using nail varnish remover and a cotton pad			2
then shape the nails with a nail file , filing each nail from one direction to the other until you reach your desired shape and length			2
following this , exfoliate the surface and tip of the nail with a gentle buffer			2
this will even out any rough ridges in the nail , leaving them super smooth and ready for the polish			2
next , gently push your cuticles back with an orange stick and tidy up any excess skin around the nails with a pair of clippers			0
@entity0 's new nail polish collection is designed to give a salon finish at home 3 - base coat it 's vital to apply a base coat to the nails before applying uv polish , as this helps protect the nail and prolongs the wear of the colour itself			1
i recommend my @entity131 , which prevents yellowing and discolouration that can build up on nails if you 're a frequent nail polish user			2
apply one layer of the base coat and place your hands under your @entity23 lamp for around 30 seconds ( timings may vary depending on the lamp you 're using , so do check the manual before getting started ! )			1
4 - @entity145 next , apply a layer of your gel colour of choice onto the nails - if you apply too much at once , the end result may look slightly gloopy , so keep the initial layer of polish relatively thin			2
place your fingers under the lamp for around 60 seconds			0
when the first coat has dried , apply a second layer and repeat			0
it 's best to do your thumbs separately so you do n't risk the polish smudging			0
5 - @entity163 coat finally , apply a high - shine top coat to give your gel manicure that sleek , salon - style finish , as well as enhancing its longevity			1
brush a layer onto nails once the colour has dried and place fingers under the lamp for 30 @entity174 there you have it - a salon - finish gel manicure from the comfort of your own home ! of course , there are a plethora of standard nail polishes you can use to create a similar high - shine , long - lasting effect on the nails if you 're short on time or do n't want to buy a @entity23 lamp			1
provided you prepare your nails thoroughly and enlist the help of a high - quality top coat , you can easily cheat your way to sleek , shiny talons			0
here are my top picks : @entity0 's top nail picks include a gorgeous purple @entity198 colour which is @entity0 's favourite @entity200 in @entity201 my gel effect polishes are designed to mimic the effects of a @entity23 gel manicure at a single stroke of a brush			1
the formula offers opaque coverage that stays chip - free for up to 10 days , with a high - shine gel - like finish			0
@entity201 is a charming crimson shade that works well for both day and night - classic , chic and fabulous			0
@entity200 in @entity213 @entity213 is one of my favourite colours from my collection - for me , it 's summer in a bottle ! it accentuates tanned skin beautifully and adds a vibrant pop of colour to a black or white outfit			0
@entity222 in @entity223 i always reach for this lustrous violet polish when i 'm wanting to amp up the glam factor			0
it provides a glossy , opaque finish in just two coats - @entity0 from the show loves it just as much as i do ! @entity230 the vibrant colours in the @entity230 nail collection are infused with light - reflecting particles that give nails an enchanting pearly shimmer			1
the formula does n't disappoint either , providing brilliantly opaque coverage in a single coat			0
@entity239 the secret to a super-slick manicure is a great top coat			0
after your polish has dried fully , apply a layer of this glossy gel - finish offering by @entity247 for super shiny ‘ just - stepped - out - of - the - salon ' nails			0
if you 're interested in trying out my @entity8 nail polishes , they 're available to buy at my favourite online beauty boutique @entity253			1
what nail colours are you all loving at the mo ? lots of love , @entity259 xxx			0
