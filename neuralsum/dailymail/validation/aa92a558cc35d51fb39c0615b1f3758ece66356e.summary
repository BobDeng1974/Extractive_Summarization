in @entity2 ’s theory of evolution , life is able to evolve through a process of ‘ natural selection ’ , where certain traits become more or less common in animals based on their benefit			1
and now researchers are starting to emulate the same process in robots , so that they can learn how to perform complex tasks			1
the research involves a similar process of selection but on a larger and faster scale , allowing artificial brains to pick out the most worthwhile traits and continue evolving			1
@entity19 carried out by a team from @entity21 used genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot brains ( stock image shown )			1
these were asked to perform tasks , such as finding the exit to a maze			1
those that performed the task best had simulated ' offspring ' , creating a better brain the research , led by computational biologist dr @entity36 from @entity21 , involves using genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot ‘ brains ’ working on a task			1
for example , this could be finding the exit to a maze			1
the brains that performed the task best had the largest number of simulated ‘ offspring ’ , meaning the smartest robots multiplied			1
the researchers ran this genetic algorithm over thousands , and sometimes hundreds of thousands of generations , and then downloaded the surviving brains into robots that executed the tasks in the outside world			1
one of the more complicated tasks the team 's robots worked on required multiple machines to figure out and remember in which order they would leave a room			1
the robots were then asked to come back into the room , either in the same order as they left , or in the reverse order			2
‘ this is difficult because the robots have to id each other , ’ dr @entity36 said			0
in december 2014 scientists mimicked evolution in the laboratory for the first time using droplets of oil			0
the researchers behind the study claim their work proves that a non-biological system composed of chemicals can be made to evolve			0
the findings mark an important step towards creating synthetic life and may also help scientists to explain how the first biological cells appeared on @entity89 more than 3.6 billion years ago			0
evolution was long believed to be a process that only biological creatures were capable of , but recent research aimed towards creating synthetic life has begun to question that idea			2
professor @entity95 , regius chair of chemistry at the @entity97 who led the new research , used a robot to create tiny oil droplets from a mixture of four chemicals			2
each droplet was dropped into a petri dish of water and analysed for three different types of ' fitness ' over the course of a minute using video cameras			0
the robot then selected the droplet that performed best and the chemical composition of this was used to replicate the experiment , tweaking the mixture slightly each time			2
over the course of 21 generations , the oil droplets became more stable in the watery world in which they were being dropped			0
this , according to professor @entity121 , mimicked the process of natural selection , which @entity2 proposed for driving evolution			1
after the genetic algorithm had run its course , the robots seemed to solve the problem by indicating roles to each other with certain motions			0
dr @entity36 believes that evolving robot brains in complicated worlds that force them to interact with each other is the best path toward self - aware intelligence			1
‘ when robots have to make models of other robots ' brains , they are thinking about thinking , ’ he said			0
‘ we believe this is the onset of consciousness			0
’ the researchers ran their genetic algorithm over thousands , and sometimes hundreds of thousands of generations , and then downloaded the surviving brains into robots that executed the tasks in the outside world			2
one of these included finding the exit to a maze ( stock image shown ) @entity2 , @entity159 naturalist , is shown here in a portrait from 1878			1
@entity2 started his career on board the @entity162 ' and spent six years surveying the @entity165 seas			2
he is remembered for his momentous contributions to biology and as the originator of the theory of evolution thinking robots will be extraordinarily useful , dr @entity36 says , adding that humanity should have no reason to fear a rise of the machines			0
‘ when our robots are " born " , they will have a brain that has the capacity to learn , but only has instincts , ’ he said			0
‘ it will take a decade or two of exploration and training for these robots to achieve human - level intelligence , just as is the case with us			0
’ he added : ‘ previous attempts to design human - like intelligence have failed because we do n't understand how our own brains work			0
‘ but we know how evolution works and we can speed it up inside of a computer			0

research was carried out by a team from @entity21
they used genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot brains
these were asked to perform tasks , such as finding the exit to a maze
those that performed the task best had simulated ' offspring ' and multiplied
in so doing they could learn to perform tasks better and better
it simulates @entity2 's theory of natural selection
