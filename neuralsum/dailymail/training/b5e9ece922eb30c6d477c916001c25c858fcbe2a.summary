asked by photographers how he had initially managed to avoid their long lenses when he left the @entity12 in @entity13 , the @entity9 mayor declared : ' i 'm like a whippet			0
' mr @entity3 , who addressed the @entity17 party conference this morning , left for his 15 - minute run around the secure zone just after 6.30am wearing a white shirt , khaki knee - length shorts and trainers			0
it begs the question whether the mayor is trying to keep pace with his rival @entity27 who is regularly photographed running before work			0
@entity3 returns to his hotel after this morning 's run this weekend the @entity32 was spotted stretching his legs along the banks of a @entity13 canal at sunrise			1
mr @entity3 's run appeared to pay off as he launched into a barnstorming speech shortly after 10am , speaking of the ' need to put the village back in the city '			1
he spoke of how his administration had planted 50,000 trees and had identified thousands more growing spaces in wasteland around the capital			1
he also spoke of building affordable , decent - sized homes for families with rooms ' big enough for humans rather than hobbits , as none of us are getting any smaller ' , and expanding his cycle hire scheme			0
speaking of the scheme - dubbed @entity54 where cyclists can hire bikes from docking stations around the centre of @entity9 - mr @entity3 said : ' there 's nothing more villagey than the sight of someone sailing elegantly past , bolt upright on one of these big , blue , burly bicycles			1
' however , he conceded he he did not know whether to be ' pleased or offended ' that not one was stolen during the @entity9 riots , saying that only bookshops were safer than his bike stands			0
mr @entity3 also contrasted the Â£ 140million bike scheme with the problems its @entity79 equivalent has encountered			0
he said just three bikes were stolen during the first two months in @entity9 where as in @entity83 hundreds were taken			0
mr @entity3 said he believes this proves there is a growing sense of ' civility and trust ' in the capital ' and ' respect for property that is public '			2
what 's on the horizon ? mr @entity3 spoke today of the ' need to put the village back in the city ' during his speech hobbits ? mr @entity3 spoke of building affordable , decent - sized homes for families with rooms ' big enough for humans rather than hobbits , as none of us are getting any smaller ' thumbs up : mr @entity3 said he believes there is a growing sense of ' civility and trust ' in the capital ' and ' respect for property that is public ' he quipped : ' does it tell you that the people of @entity9 are more honest than the light - fingered @entity116 ? i would point out in @entity83 over a comparable period they managed to lose 500 bicycles			1
' i do n't want to violate the " entente cordial " but it seems to me there are obvious comparisons to be drawn between our population and the light - fingered @entity116			0
' what i do think it shows is a growing sense of civility and trust in @entity9 , and respect for property that is public			0
' mr @entity3 said the ' village ' mentality , where people know each others names , was key to fighting crime			1
rival ? mr @entity27 stands to applaud @entity3 's barnstorming speech this morning			2
many believe mr @entity3 harbours hopes of succeeding mr @entity27 on the economy , mr @entity3 said that the capital could drive @entity143 's economic recovery if investment in transport continues			1
he urged the government not to scrap spending projects in the city despite the tough financial climate			2
mr @entity3 urged the government not to scrap spending projects in the city despite the tough financial climate he said : ' thanks to the common sense of this coalition government , the settlement we got last year , we not only have the tube upgrades , we have @entity157 and @entity158 , which is going to be as fantastic as @entity157			2
' i will not allow that investment and these vital improvements to be jeopardised for a short - term political gain			2
' and addressing the prime minister directly , he added : ' i say to my friends in the @entity166 - not all of whom i see here ; well , @entity170 offered a new deal			0
' i give you the wheel deal : you help us to invest in transport infrastructure and we in @entity9 will supply the locomotive of the @entity143 economy			1
' mr @entity3 said cutting crime and improving transport would attract businesses and called for ' the right tax and regulatory framework - i will say no more than that ' , believing ' @entity143 enterprise will do the rest '			1
he told party members : ' i reckon we have a record to be proud of			0
' we have effectively cut the council tax by 10 % over the last three years , we have put @entity189 on the overground , we have delivered a 24 - hour freedom pass for the people of @entity9 - a fact i hardly dare mention in @entity13 in case they get jealous - ( and ) the last bendy bus will leave our streets by @entity198			1
spotlight : mr @entity3 takes to the stage at the party conference			0
he told activists he wanted to make sure people who swear at police officers are arrested ' in the new year we will see a generation of @entity207 - style bus with the open platform			1
' mr @entity3 , who previously criticised the government 's plans to cut police numbers , said he would not allow the number of officers in the @entity214 to dip below what he deemed ' safe and reasonable '			1
in addition , he said he was changing guidance given to the @entity214 to make sure people who swear at officers are arrested			1
activists gave the mayor a standing ovation as he closed his speech saying he had delivered ' sensible , moderate , one - nation @entity17 government in @entity9 ' , but there was ' so much more to do '			0
@entity3 leaves the conference hotel ahead of his speech this morning he added : ' i have no doubt it is going to be a tough fight , but with your help we can do it again			0
' mr @entity27 , who was in the hall for mr @entity3 's address , earlier praised the mayor , who many believe harbours hopes of succeeding mr @entity27 as @entity17 leader and prime minister			2
mr @entity27 told @entity239 today : ' at a time of economic difficulty , i think he brings strong , charismatic leadership , he brings people together , he cheers people up			1
' i am right behind him because i think the last thing @entity9 needs is a return to @entity247			0
' mr @entity248 later blasted mr @entity3 's speech , branding him ' out of touch '			2
the @entity252 candidate said : ' today we saw the real @entity3 - an out - of - touch @entity17 , failing to put ordinary @entity254 first on the issues that really affect them , from rising fares to police cuts			1
' he gave no hope to @entity254 facing another steep fare rise this january , which will mean bus fares are up 56 % under a @entity17 mayor , and gave no hard commitment on police numbers , which are in fact due to fall by 1,800 according to his own @entity214 figures			2
' under the @entity17 , @entity254 are less well - off and increasingly less safe , under a moonlighting mayor who meets bankers more than the police			0
' people in @entity9 are feeling the squeeze but @entity3 does n't see it			0

@entity273 *pledges* to ' put the village back in the city '
he said the capital could drive @entity143 's economic recovery if investment in transport continues
