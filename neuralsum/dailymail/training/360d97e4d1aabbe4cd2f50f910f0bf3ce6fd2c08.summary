the 30 - year - old refuted the claim during an online q&a session yesterday , adding that while returning to the @entity12 would be the ' best resolution ' for everyone , doing so is impossible because he has ' no chance ' of a fair trial			1
the whistleblower is currently living under temporary asylum in @entity19 after revealing @entity12 government secrets on surveillance programs and other activities last year			2
no fair : the 30 - year - old refuted the claim during a q&a session on the ' @entity28 ' website yesterday , adding that while returning to the @entity12 would be the ' best resolution ' for everyone , doing so is impossible because he has ' no chance ' of a fair trial ' i 'm not a spy ' : @entity2 in october 11 , 2013 during a @entity35 press conference			1
he has denied stealing co-workers ' passwords to illegally access the @entity6 's database and leak its secrets to the world a @entity42 report in november that quoted unnamed sources as saying @entity2 used login credentials and passwords provided unwittingly by colleagues at a spy base in @entity48 to access some of the classified material he leaked to the media			1
but @entity2 branded that report ' simply wrong , ' adding , ' i never stole any passwords , nor did i trick an army of co-workers			1
' and yesterday he claimed the nearly 100 - year - old @entity57 , under which he is charged , ' forbids a public interest defense			1
' ' this is especially frustrating , because it means there ’s no chance to have a fair trial , and no way i can come home and make my case to a jury , ' he said			1
' returning to the @entity12 , i think , is the best resolution for the government , the public , and myself , but it 's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws , which , through a failure in law , did not cover national security contractors like myself , ' he told the ' @entity28 ' website			0
earlier , @entity12 attorney general @entity80 said that if @entity2 wanted to return to the @entity12 and enter a guilty plea , the @entity81 would ' engage with his lawyers			1
' ' of course if mr. @entity2 ’s lawyers informed us their client was prepared to take accountability by pleading guilty to the charges filed against him , we would engage with his lawyers on that , as we would with any other defendant , ' a @entity81 spokesperson echoed later			1
@entity2 has denied the accusations of the @entity96 that he worked with the @entity19 security services to leak documents about @entity12 national security it comes after @entity2 denied accusations that he worked in cahoots with the @entity19 government to leak secrets , calling the theories ' absurd '			1
before that , the @entity96 chair , rep. @entity106 , who is in charge of an ongoing investigations into @entity2 's relationship with @entity19 , said : ' i believe there 's a reason he ended up in their hands , the " loving arms " of an @entity119 ( @entity19 security ) agent in @entity120			1
i do n't think that 's a coincidence			0
' in response to the allegations , @entity2 said : ' i clearly and unambiguously acted alone , with no assistance from anyone , much less a government			1
' it wo n't stick , because it 's clearly false , and the @entity12 people are smarter than politicians think they are			0
this @entity19 spy push is absurd			0
' in addition , a top member of the the @entity96 's @entity134 , rep. @entity135 , said : ' i personally believe that he was cultivated by a foreign power to do what he did			0
@entity12 president @entity139 speaks about the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) and intelligence agencies surveillance techniques in the @entity12 , reacting to leaks by former @entity6 contractor @entity2 in the speech @entity139 said more could be done to protect the civil liberties of his citizens , and also pledged to end spying on friendly heads of state ' i ca n't give a definitive statement on that , but i 've been given all the evidence i know @entity106 has access to			2
i do n't think he was working alone			0
' speaking in an interview with the @entity154 , @entity2 pointed to the forty days he spent trapped in @entity155 in @entity120 after he fled the @entity12 , as evidence that he had worked alone			2
he said : ' spies get treated better than that			0
' this is not the first allegation against @entity2 claiming he is a spy			2
last july he was accused of working for the @entity161 , and has come out against the media for reporting the allegations both last year , and today			1
he said : ' if i were a @entity161 spy , why would n't i have flown directly to @entity165 ? i could be living in a palace petting a @entity167 by now			2
the media has a major role to play in @entity12 society , and they 're really abdicating their responsibility to hold power to account			0
' in danger : @entity2 took refuge in @entity120 to evade treason charges after disclosing @entity12 state secrets on @entity6 intelligence gathering , and now fears for his life and wants to increase security the allegations have come only days after president @entity139 spoke last friday about the trimming the power of @entity12 intelligence services , reacting to the leaks by @entity2			1
speaking at the @entity12 @entity81 on january 17 , he called for new privacy safeguards and said he had stopped the @entity6 spy taps on friendly world leaders			0
the president said he would be ending the @entity6 's hoarding of telephone " metadata " , informaion that shows the detail and destination of calls , but not their content , agreeing with critics who said that the program could open the door to more intrusion			0
however , @entity139 has decided that he will allow bulk phone data sweeps of the citizens living in the @entity12 to continue as an anti-terror tool			0
he said : ' i believe we need a new approach			0
i am therefore ordering a transition that will end the section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists , and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk meta - data			0
