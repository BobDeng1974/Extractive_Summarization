an uber customer was hit with a huge $ 16,000 bill for her 7 - mile nightmare journey across @entity3			1
@entity4 said her driver had been on his phone , cut across lanes , and even driven down a bus lane during the 35 minute ' trip from hell ' from her @entity12 apartment to @entity13			1
so she was stunned to receive a message from the cab - hailing app telling her she owed them thousands of dollars for the trip across boroughs , reported the @entity20			1
the infuriating story was first posted on @entity22			0
but alarms bells were triggered as soon as she got in the car to find the driver appeared distracted			0
after sitting in the vehicle for around five minutes before setting off , he soon began to ignore the gps , taking a longer and more complicated route , according to ms @entity24			2
to the passenger 's terror , instead of paying his full attention to the road , the driver was also taking phone calls and checking his voicemail during the trip			2
ms @entity24 claims that the car dangerously cut across lanes of traffic on several occasions and was even driven down a bus lane until she demanded to be let out early			1
' i had him drop me off a block away from the bar because i did n't want to be in the car anymore			0
i felt very unsafe , ' she told the @entity20			2
shock : ms @entity24 was horrified when @entity25 billed her for $ 16,000 - with a $ 4,000 refund			1
her total statement was $ 12,251.49 @entity25 says the eye - popping figure was a clerical error and that the customer was never actually charged the outrageous sum but the nightmare trip was far from over			1
after receiving her initial bill of $ 56.40 , the passenger immediate e-mailed @entity66 to complain she had been overcharged and that the driver had unnecessarily extended the ride			2
within a few days , the @entity25 resp had written back to inform ms @entity24 the company agreed the journey was ' inefficient ' and she would get a refund of $ 15			1
but the following morning , she received a bizarre email which stated she owed @entity25 more than $ 16,000 - with a refund of $ 4,000			2
her total , in the end , came to $ 12,251.49			0
' it freaked me out , ' she told @entity80			0
' i have bad eye sight and i thought maybe i was n't reading it correctly			0
' the panicked ms @entity24 quickly got in touch with the company again to inform them of their error and said she felt lucky that her credit card had expired between the journey and the bill so the transport app would have been unable to charge her			1
@entity25 has since wiped the bill and offered to pay her the original $ 15 refund but ms @entity24 said she now feels she ca n't trust them with her new card details			1
they say it was a clerical error and that she was never actually charged the $ 16,000			1
she added it was unlikely she would ever use the app again			0
' i do n't know if i 'll use it again , ' she told @entity101			0
' maybe i 'll do it if it 'll be somebody else 's credit card			0
' the company has since pledged to refund the entire cost of her ride			0
a spokesman said : ' we apologize to this rider for any inconvenience and we have provided them with a full refund			0
