the @entity0 suggested on wednesday that even if the information @entity2 operatives extracted from terrorism detainees through the use of torture tactics had led to the killing of @entity9 leader @entity8 , the brutal interrogation techniques should never have been used			1
@entity0 press secretary @entity11 would not concede that the measures taken by the @entity2 during the @entity15 administration did in fact produce actionable information , citing the divisions within the intelligence community and @entity19 on the issue			1
however , he told reporters that the president believes ' regardless of which side of that debate that you 're on , that the need to strengthen and enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount when it comes to this question			1
' a review of @entity2 records found that the initial intelligence obtained , as well as the information the @entity2 identified as the most critical — or the most valuable — on [ @entity8 courier ] @entity55 , was not related to the use of the @entity2 ’s enhanced interrogation techniques , ' the report states			1
according to the @entity59 who authored the study , the @entity2 waterboarded 9/11 mastermind @entity62 183 times in one month as part of what a medical officer described as a ' series of near drownings ' and subjected him to sleep deprivation , rectal rehydration and stress positions			2
yet , the @entity43 report states that he repeatedly gave them ' fabricated ' or ' unfounded ' information			0
one @entity9 affiliate that @entity78 named , @entity79 , did play a central role in the slaying of @entity8 , the paper says , but @entity78 volunteered that information before he was worked over by the @entity2			2
@entity79 also gave the @entity2 intelligence pivotal to the hunt for @entity8 , according to the report			0
but that , too , came before he was mistreated			0
' he sang like a tweetie bird			0
he opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset , ' a @entity2 officer is quoted as saying			0
it was after his initial confessions that he was deprived of sleep , the @entity43 review said			0
and when it was determined that he had told the truth , the @entity2 lied and said he gave up the information only after he was put through physical and mental discomfort			2
in its response to the @entity43 report , the @entity2 said it is ' impossible to know in hindsight ' if the information that led the @entity103 to @entity8 could have been secured through traditional methods			1
' however , the information we did obtain from these detainees played a role — in combination with other important streams of intelligence — in finding the @entity9 leader , ' the agency said			0
the president 's spokesman also refused to engaged in a counterfactual with reporters today on whether or not @entity8 would have been taken out had the @entity2 acted less aggressively , telling them at his daily briefing that ' it is impossible for us to go back in time and determine whether or not some of the information ' that backers of the techniques believe ' yielded information that was critical to the success of the mission could have also been obtained through other measures			1
' it 's impossible and unknowable , actually , whether or not that information that they say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used , ' he further clarified			1
@entity11 said that the president did receive an intelligence briefing before the raid that resulted in @entity8 's death , but it ' does n't necessarially provide a detailed account of how that intelligence was obtained			2
' ' the point is , ' he said , the president has ' spoken unequivocally about his view of this matter			0
' it is his view that the use of these enhanced interrogation techniques does not serve our national interest , it does not make us safer , because it undermines our moral authority , and our moral authority around the globe is critically important to protecting and even advancing @entity103 interests , ' he concluded			1

after @entity161 killed @entity8 bin laden in @entity163 in may 2011 , top @entity2 officials secretly told lawmakers that information gleaned from brutal interrogations played a key role in what was one of the spy agency 's greatest successes in this may 3 , 2011 photo , local residents gather outside a house , where @entity8 was caught and killed in @entity175 , @entity163			1
the @entity0 said today it 's ' impossible and unknowable ' whether or not the information that backers of enhanced interrogation ' say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used ' at another point in the briefing he told reporters that ' there are other things that we ca n't know , but there is one thing that the president knows ... that continuing to employ the techniques that are described in that report would only undermine one of the most powerful weapons on our arsenal to protect @entity103 national security			1
' and that is the moral authority around the globe of the @entity103 , ' he said			2
president @entity200 believes ' that tool is worth protecting and strengthening , ' @entity11 explained , ' and that 's why he outlawed these techniques ' during his first few days in office and directed the @entity205 and his national security team to conduct a ' broad review of the guidelines and procedures for interrogating and detaining individuals in custody			1
' it 's also why he ' strongly advocated ' for the @entity43 to publish its review , he said			0
ahead of @entity43 chair @entity216 's release of the study revealing the depth and breadth of the post- 9/11 program that subjected terrorism suspects to treatment that @entity200 has said ' constituted torture , ' former president @entity15 , @entity224 on @entity225 , and even secretary of state @entity226 urged the @entity228 lawmaker not make the 600 - page report public , at least not at this time			1
@entity216 refused to back down , however , as her time as the committee 's head dwindled down			0
' is there ever a good time to admit our country tortured people ? ' she said in an op - ed released tuesday in the @entity237 simultaneously with the @entity43 's finished @entity2 review			2
' the bottom line is , torture occurred , and we must own up to our actions and move forward			0
' ' we 're not perfect and there are some dark patches in our past , but what makes us special is that we recognize these evils , we come to grips with them and we fix them , ' she said			0
noting @entity200 's support for the release of the redacted documents and his executive action in 2009 to disband the program , @entity216 said the ' report is the next step toward enacting major reforms to ensure something like this never happens again			2

@entity0 would not concede that the measures taken by the @entity2 during the @entity15 administration did in fact produce actionable information
' it 's impossible and unknowable ' whether or not that information could have been obtained through a ' more conventional interrogation technique
' regardless of which side of that debate that you 're on , ' @entity200 believes the need to ' enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount '
the president thinks the use of ' enhanced interrogation techniques does not serve our national interest , it does not make us safer '
