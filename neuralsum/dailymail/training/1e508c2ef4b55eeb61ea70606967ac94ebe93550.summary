by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:22 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 14:02 est , 22 january 2014 @entity5 governor @entity4 's recent spate of scandals are troublesome enough to get in the way of his mission as chairman of the powerful @entity10 , former @entity12 attorney general and losing 2013 gubernatorial candidate @entity13 said tuesday			1
the @entity10 controls a $ 150 million purse collected to help @entity15 win governor 's races			2
@entity4 has the group 's reins for a one - year term			2
@entity13 referred to @entity4 's ' @entity22 ' scandal and claims that his administration used @entity25 relief dollars as political leverage , telling @entity27 that it ' makes sense ' for him to step down			1
' i think just from the perspective of – setting aside this as an issue in other races , it makes sense for him to step aside in that role , ' @entity13 said			0
' he does not serve the goals of that organization by staying as chairman			0
and that does n’t mean any of the charges , political or otherwise , are substantive or not			0
he was @entity1 president @entity61 's fundraising leader in the 1990s @entity13 lost his bid to be @entity12 's governor by less than 67,000 votes after closing a 10 per cent gap in the race 's last weeks , bringing insiders to carp that the election was winnable but underfunded			1
the @entity10 spent $ 8 million helping @entity13 , but choked off ad - buy dollars down the stretch			2
democrat @entity59 , the state 's new governor , spent heavily on tv ads in the closing weeks of the contest			2
on election night , @entity15 carped at @entity4 for pulling out of @entity12 while the @entity10 continued to lavish $ 1.7 million more to cement @entity4 's landslide win			1
' i heard from one @entity10 source who said , " where was @entity4 ? " ' reported @entity77 's @entity76 from a @entity59 's victory party			1
' apparently some senior conservative @entity15 reached out to @entity4 and asked him to come down to @entity12 and campaign for @entity13 and @entity4 said no. ... a lot of @entity13 supporters are a little bit bitter right now looking at the result , thinking , " what if ? " ' crossfire : @entity13 took the bait when liberal commentator @entity87 asked if @entity4 should be bounced from the @entity10 @entity4 ( center - left ) is beginning his second term in @entity90 , @entity5 while scandals and new investigations surround him , including an accusation that he ordered his lieutenant governor to use @entity25 federal relief dollars as bargaining chips so a commercial development would go forward @entity13 's camp believed that @entity4 could have won the race for them if he had shown up in person to campaign in @entity12 -- and that the @entity10 torpedoed them by stopping the flow of money in the race 's crucial final weeks a bitter @entity13 reminded @entity27 's audience on tuesday that the fallout from @entity4 's ' @entity22 ' is just beginning to settle			1
' frankly , i think this is still relatively new and he may well step down ' from the @entity10 , ' he said			0
' i have no idea what his thinking is on that			0
and he may get some counsel from some other governors along those lines			0
' @entity4 took over the @entity10 chairmanship after the 2013 election , but @entity13 blames him for not showing up in person to campaign in @entity12 the @entity10 itself did not respond to a request for comment			1
but long - time @entity4 adviser @entity123 told the @entity124 that @entity13 's comments were ' disappointing , given the @entity10 was by far the largest single donor to his losing campaign , giving more than $ 8 million — a significant portion of which was raised by gov. @entity4			1
' the embattled @entity5 governor is already using his position in the @entity10 as a platform to raise money for republicans in states that will be critical to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election			2
@entity4 is expected to announce a run for president by the middle of next year			0
in the early days of the bridge scandal , centered on @entity4 aides who allegedly arranged for a traffic jam leading to the @entity144 as revenge against a @entity147 mayor in nearby @entity148 , @entity5 , the @entity10 issued a strong statement of support for its leader			1
' governor @entity4 apologized to the people of @entity5 , the people of @entity148 and to the members of the @entity5 legislature			1
' he made it clear that members of his team exhibited unacceptable conduct and a complete lack of respect for both the role of government and the people he is trusted to serve			0
he believes that when mistakes are made , you own up to them			0
that ’s what leadership is about			0

losing candidate for @entity12 governor wants @entity4 gone from the organization that shut off the money *spigot* in his political race
@entity13 lost by a *narrow* *margin* to @entity61 's former fundraising chief despite closing a huge gap in the final weeks
but @entity4 *declined* to spend time campaigning for ' @entity186 , ' even though his own @entity5 race was a *cakewalk*
and the @entity10 , some @entity57 insiders think , *abandoned* them when victory was within reach
now @entity13 claims @entity4 's ' @entity22 ' scandal will drag down other governors , meaning he should step down as the @entity10 's chairman
