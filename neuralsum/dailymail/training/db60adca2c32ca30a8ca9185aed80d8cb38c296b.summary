' @entity44 is a fantastic player as he has shown to get into contention			0
he will perform on sunday and i wish him the best in getting ( the @entity4 place ) but i have to accomplish my job of getting into the mix and picking up win number three			1
' @entity0 , who won the @entity51 in 2010 and @entity11 masters in 2012 , added : ' it 's a tough one because i know @entity44 well and am down at @entity54 a fair bit where he practises , which is about a mile from his house			1
' it 's a big , big ask for him but he has shown how good a player he is and if he did not qualify automatically he would be an asset to the team , not only because of his ball - striking but his attitude as well			2
his record at @entity13 is impressive too			0

' the worst thing i could have done was open up a big gap which was insurmountable			2
i 've not done that so a good day on sunday and i am still right in there			0
i had about four lip - outs today but they went in on friday and i holed a couple of good putts at the end so it evens itself out			0

i have done my day job and done it well but it is a long week and will take a lot out of me mentally but i have two weeks off after this and one round to go , so will give it my best shot			0
