by @entity0 would you live in a parking space - sized house ? that ’s what one group of students are hoping will solve the housing crisis			1
their unique invention could provide urban dwellers with alternative living arrangements			1
no place like home ? the @entity15 has unveiled their miniature houses , called @entity17 , that they say could solve the housing crisis @entity15 stands for the @entity15 , a private university with locations in @entity21 , @entity22 in the @entity23 , and also @entity24 and @entity25			1
the world ’s urban population is currently 3.5 billion			2
it is expected to hit 5 billion by 2035			0
81 % of the @entity23 population lives in urban areas			1
but there is already a shortage of housing for people in populous cities			2
there are apparently 105 million parking spaces in the @entity23			1
that is apparently five spaces for every car			2
half of all spaces are vacant 40 % of the time			2
these , the university says , can be used to solve the housing crisis by filling them with @entity47			1
it was students from @entity50 in @entity21 that came up with this design when they were tasked with making use of a five - storey car park			1
they came up with these mini-houses that are not only small enough to fit in a parking space but also affordable , each costing an estimated £ 24,000 ( £ 40,000 ) to build			1
‘ as the housing shortage in crowded cities becomes increasingly apparent , president @entity62 and @entity15 designers have answered the call with the university ’s boldest innovation yet , ’ the university said in a statement			2
‘ branded as a luxury product , @entity68 features an individualised interior , interactive controls and green amenities			0
‘ the micro homes feature custom exterior and interior elements , modular wall systems , automated home control , sustainable waste management and multifunctional , multipurpose @entity80 printed furniture			2
’ a few students in @entity21 have been selected to trial the @entity17 for a few days to give feedback on the miniature homes			1
each of the homes contains all the amenities you ’d expect to find in a regular house			0
the 135 - sq ft residences are surprisingly spacious and include a toilet , bed , desk and kitchen			0
ultimately , it ’s hoped that multiple @entity17 can be used to create small housing communities in unused parking lots			1
while only in prototype phase at the moment , the university hopes that in future vacant parking lots can be filled with these miniature homes to solve the housing crisis each @entity106 comes with most of the things you 'd expect from a full - sized home including a desk , bed , bathroom and kitchen big problem , tiny solution ? each @entity68 is 8 feet wide and 16 feet long , small enough to fit in a parking space all electronics in the @entity68 are controlled through an @entity118			1
lighting can be changed from a deep blue to a bright orange			0
the windows can be frosted and unfrosted to give you privacy or scenery when you need it			0
the shelving within is 3d - printed			0
some of the homes have interactive wallpaper that plays music when it ’s touched			0
the houses heat up quickly , so not much energy is needed to keep them warm			0
there is also a filtration system tied into the shower and sink			0
the windows ca n't be opened , but the @entity17 do have air conditioning and ventilation fans			2
according to the university , the global urban population will hit 5 billion people in the next two decades , while 81 per cent of the @entity23 population lives in urban areas			1
but , they say , the world ’s most populous cities are struggling to cope with this influx of people and there is a shortage of suitable housing			0
this project is designed to address the problem by utilising space that is otherwise going unnoticed , in car parks			0
three pilot @entity47 have now been developed in a process that took 10 months			0
but , the university says each unit could eventually be constructed in one to two months			0
three ' model homes ' are on display at the moment , when they will be lived in by students for a few days to give feedback on what it 's like to live in the enclosed spaces			1

university students in @entity21 have designed mini-houses for urban living
' @entity17 ' are 8 feet wide , 16 feet long and can fit in @entity23 parking spaces
each *$* 40,000 abode can be individually *tailored* and decorated
the team says half of @entity23 's 105 million parking spaces are empty
and the ' housing crisis ' could be solved by filling them with these homes
