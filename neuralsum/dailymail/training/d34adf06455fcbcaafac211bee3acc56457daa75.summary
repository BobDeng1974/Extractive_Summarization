author ] published : 14:51 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 16:37 est , 4 october 2013 a woman has opened up about her shock when a picture of her went viral for the wrong reasons - and how she won back her dignity			1
@entity7 native @entity6 , 24 , wrote on @entity8 that she was initially ' kind of amused ' when a friend informed her that her picture had been used on a website that mocked people 's appearances			1
but once she began scrolling through the hateful comments that referred to her as a ' heifer ' and suggested she should ' just kill herself ' , ms @entity6 says she felt like ' the world imploded - and took my heart with it			1
' caught off - guard : @entity6 , 24 , was shocked after reading the comments on this photo of her that went viral on a site mocking people 's appearances , writing : ' the world imploded - and took my heart with it ' in the photo , which was taken on @entity29 , ms @entity6 is dressed up as her favorite video game heroin @entity32 from @entity33			1
but the caption on the website read ' @entity36 ' instead			1
' that picture was taken late in the evening , ' she explains			2
' i was red - faced from the heat , my makeup was sweating off and i was lacking proper boob support			2
' while to her , the photo showed how much fun she was having at the time , commenters - most of them women - took a different view , cruelly remarking on her appearance			2
some of the critics wrote that she was a ' waste of space , ' while others suggested she should die to ' spare everyone 's eyes			0
' despite her sadness and shock at the comments , ms @entity6 admits she understood why these internet users sunk so low			2
' no one thought about the possibility that i might read those words			0
far less that i would talk ' ' of course , they had n't really thought of me as a person			0
why should they ? these images are throwaways , little bursts of amusement to get through a long workday			0
' no one thought about the possibility that i might read those words , ' she writes			0
' far less , that i would talk			0
' and talk she did			0
instead of wallowing in self - pity , ms @entity6 decided to take action by retaliating against her hateful critics , and taking back her dignity			2
getting back : to regain her confidence she did a pin - up girl photo shoot with a friend ( pictured ) her own terms : ms @entity6 said the new photo shoot helped her see herself as she wanted to be seen she started by finding out who had written the comments and sent them messages that read : ' you 're being an a * * * * * *			1
' why do n't you just do the right thing and delete the post and stop sharing it ? ' ' i got a number of them taken down , but once something like this spreads it 's out there forever ' next , she used her training as a paralegal to send out hundreds of copyright violation notices to each of the websites that had hosted her image			1
' i got a fair number of them taken down , but once something like this spreads , it 's out there forever , ' she writes , adding that she still gets concerned friends asking her if she knows her image is being used on the internet			0
teaching them a lesson : using her training as a paralegal , she found out who the commenters were and issued copyright violation notices to the websites since the incident , she has taken to sticking up for people on similar websites , and she 's also learned to keep a close watch on her privacy settings online			1
she also enlisted a photographer friend to do a retro pinup photo shoot with her , which helped her regain self - confidence and see herself as she really wanted to be seen			1
but her biggest and most satisfying form of retaliation is in continuing to share the photo , on her own terms			0
' to own it again , without shame this time , ' she explains .			0
