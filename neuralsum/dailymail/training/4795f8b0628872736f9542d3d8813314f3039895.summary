@entity0 described it as ' good fun ' , his brutal demolition of @entity4 on thursday night in front of nearly 18,000 people at the @entity7			1
this seemed like @entity0 's idea of a great evening out , showing no mercy as he ended the @entity13 player 's season and so nearly provided him with the embarassment of tasting tennis 's dreaded ' double bagel ' defeat			1
four minutes after @entity4 had drawn riotous cheers by breaking his duck after losing the first eleven games , @entity0 formally went through to the semi-finals of the @entity22 , courtesy of a 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 victory that took less than an hour			1
it had taken just 24 minutes for that to become irrelevant , and soon the question was , numbingly , more whether @entity4 would win a game			1
@entity13 's @entity49 champion has not suffered a worse beating since losing as a 16 year - old to someone called @entity52 at an obscure tournament on @entity54 in 2003			2
he put in such a valiant effort to qualify for this elite field from his post @entity58 standing , but might have wished he had not bothered			0
the abiding image will not be so much of @entity4 's bemusment but of @entity0 's relentless pursuit of his quarry , and for all his ageless brilliance it was painful to watch			1
at 33 he is not sated , although he claimed later to have felt ' uncomfortable ' at the end			0
' i was happy i did n't win the second to last game to be quite honest , ' said @entity0			1
it did not look that way â€“ it looked like he was enjoying himself			0
the @entity13 no 1 could not find his range and rhythm at @entity76 's @entity75 @entity0 cruised into the last four of the @entity77 in @entity76 @entity78 happy to spare @entity4 double bagel for @entity4 it was chastening , this ninth and heaviest loss without reply to the three players with whom he used to make up the so - called @entity85			1
' it was a tough night , and i have lost @entity89 finals which have been very tough , ' he reflected afterwards			0
' he played exceptionally well , i was disdappointed with my level tonight but even if i had played better i would still have lost			0
' he was extremely loose tonight after knowing he was through the group and was able to try shots that might not in other situations , everything came off			0
' i 'm not going to try and forget this , i 'll try and use it as motivation for the off season to change some things			0
it 's clear i need to make some adjustments to my game			2
@entity103 ( left ) and @entity105 boss @entity104 ( right ) watch @entity4 take on @entity0 @entity4 was given the runaround by @entity0 at @entity76 's @entity75 the chastening defeat brought the curtain down on @entity4 's 2014 campaign ' there are some matches when you might have behaved badly or felt like you did n't give it your best and maybe embarrassed about that , but i was trying tonight , there was nothing wrong with me			1
' such commendable honesty will serve him well as he heads into the off season , in which his first duty will be to serve as best man at recently retired @entity13 player @entity123 's wedding			2
after that he has a lot to do clear the scar tissue from this , and a year which was never likely to be easy following the recovery from back surgery twelve months ago			0
it is no bad thing that there are two months to regroup before the 2015 @entity133			0
there is no such thing as home advantage when playing @entity0 in @entity76 and , not unexpectedly , the clapometer registered at least as loudly for the @entity42 as it did for @entity4 when they made their customary rockstar entrances			1
@entity104 was among those in the house to see the player of the @entity143 at the former @entity144 , and it was not long before @entity0 was sealing @entity4 's fate			1
after an even start it was a run of 14 points in the @entity42 's favour that settled the first set , @entity4 powerless to resist his net rushes and panic gradually seeping in			2
winning that twelfth game might have felt like winning the clincher against @entity156 in the 2013 @entity49 final			0
@entity0 has probably succeeded in avoiding @entity156 in the semi-finals , and will likely play him in sunday 's climax			2
as for @entity4 , he has to figure out how to bridge the yawning gulf that has opened between himself and the very top players			0

@entity4 had to win in straight sets to reach last four but he failed to win a single game in first set
@entity0 raced through first six games in just 24 minutes at @entity76 's @entity75 on thursday night
the @entity40 was facing his first double bagel defeat since he was 16 until he held serve in 12th game
