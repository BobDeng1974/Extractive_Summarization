@entity0 took the seismic decision to sack their best player on tuesday as the fallout from the worst @entity5 tour in their history claimed its most high - profile victim in @entity8			1
@entity9 , the new managing director of the @entity0 team , made the huge call to dismiss @entity8 — the leading runscorer in their history — just three days after overseeing the departure of their most successful coach @entity15			1
@entity9 on tuesday met @entity0 captain @entity17 and one - day coach @entity18 in a hotel opposite @entity20 ’s and they reached the ‘ unanimous ’ conclusion that @entity8 , after almost as many controversies as runs , is more trouble than he is worth			1
on thursday the batsman posted this message on @entity28 : ' so sad that this will now be the last time i leave a field in an @entity0 shirt ... incredibly … ' with a link to an @entity36 picture of him trudging off the @entity38			2
@entity0 exit : @entity8 peers out of his car after discovering his international career is over off drive : @entity8 leaves the @entity44 following a coaching session as his future was being decided bittersweet tweet : @entity8 posted this on @entity28 with a link to this @entity36 picture ( below ) showing him leaving the @entity38 , but his reaction in the dressing room was n't taken to kindly @entity53 leapt to his friend 's defence , calling the decision a disgrace : ' i also just heard the sad news re @entity8 that he has played his last game for @entity0 , to me it 's a disgrace & a joke ! the @entity62 is in a shambles '			1
and his @entity0 and @entity65 team - mate @entity64 tweeted : ' sad to see what has happened with @ @entity68 a great player for @entity0 and a match winner			2
i wish him all the best in the future			0
' the gifted maverick will not be considered for the one - day tour of @entity75 and the @entity76 that follows next month , meaning an @entity0 career of 104 tests , 23 hundreds and more than 8,000 runs has reached its end			1
‘ clearly this has been a tough decision , ’ said @entity9			0
‘ @entity8 has been an outstanding player for @entity0			2
‘ however , there was a need to begin the long - term planning after the @entity87 tour			0
therefore we have decided that the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also the team ethic and philosophy			0
’ it was the only clue in a bland statement as to the real reasons behind @entity8 ’s departure , which @entity98 understands centres on his attitude , particularly towards the end of the @entity5 , and what is perceived to be his poor influence on younger members of the team			2
‘ playing cricket for my country has been an honour , ’ said the @entity106 - born @entity8 , who chose his mother ’s country in 2004			1
‘ every time i pulled on the @entity0 shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and something that will live with me for ever			0

i will continue to play but deeply regret it wo n’t be for @entity0			0
’ @entity8 ’s departure is the biggest example yet of the dismantling of the @entity0 team in the wake of their horror showing in @entity87			2
@entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 all left the tour early while @entity8 and @entity15 have gone for good , although @entity15 is expected to remain in a development role with the @entity62			2
@entity9 ’s next job is to find a coach across all formats , with @entity18 the favourite despite overseeing the 4 - 1 one - day series defeat in @entity87 and the 3 - 0 @entity76 whitewash			1
@entity8 can now be expected to cash in on the @entity76 circuit and will make himself available for the whole six weeks of the @entity148			0
he will also play in the @entity149 but first links up with his mentor @entity151 , the new @entity65 coach , for the domestic season			0
happier times : @entity8 is presented with a commemorative cap after playing in his 100th test selection headache : @entity0 captain @entity17 and one - day coach @entity18 held crunch talks out of place ? he was a character , but @entity106 - born @entity8 never belonged @entity8 has been informed by the @entity62 that he has not been included in the @entity0 squads for the forthcoming tour of the @entity163 later this month nor the @entity76 to be held in @entity164 in march			1
@entity8 met with @entity9 , the managing director @entity0 , this week and was told that the unanimous decision of the @entity0 management , including the selectors , was that now was the time to start the rebuilding process after @entity0 's disappointing winter in @entity87			1
@entity9 said : ' clearly this was a tough decision because @entity8 has been such an outstanding player for @entity0 as the fact that he is the country 's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates			1
' however everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the @entity87 tour			0
therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy			0
' @entity0 cricket owes a debt of gratitude to @entity8 who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill			1
' this decision brings some clarity now for the future of the @entity0 teams and we all wish @entity8 the very best in the rest of his career			2
' @entity8 played 104 @entity203 , 136 one day internationals and 37 @entity205 for @entity0 in a career which has spanned from november 2004 to the final ashes test match in @entity38 in early january			1
@entity8 said : ' playing cricket for my country has been an honour			1
every time i pulled on the @entity0 shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever			0
' although i am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end , i 'm also hugely proud of what we , as a team , have achieved over the past nine years			0
