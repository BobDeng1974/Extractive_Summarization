more than 10,000 dogs a year are poisoned after eating everyday items such as paracetamol and chocolate , a pet charity has warned			2
the @entity5 says seemingly harmless foods such as hot cross buns and onions can be killers – and is urging owners to be alert to the threat			1
around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014 , according to figures compiled by the charity and the @entity16			1

sick : around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014 unlike @entity27 prizewinner @entity26 the @entity23 setter , who died last month after eating meat laced with poison , most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well - meaning owners			1
painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning , followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate – which can cause sickness , diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems			1

@entity55 , a @entity5 poisons expert , said : ‘ there are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances , whether by accident , deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products – particularly foods eaten by humans – are fine for a dog to eat			1
‘ many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much - loved pets			1
’ the popularity of e-cigarettes has seen them feature more prominently among poisoning cases , with 64 dogs taken to the vet in 2014 after chewing the nicotine - rich refills – an increase of 300 per cent			2
however , many more cases are suspected to have occurred , because not all poisonings are reported			0
chewing gum was another major cause of poisoning			0
just one pack of gum can prove deadly , causing dangerous drops in blood sugar and liver failure			0
if you fear your dog has been poisoned , the @entity5 urges owners to contact their vet immediately , even if their dog appears well , as it can take several days before symptoms appear			2
mr @entity55 said : ‘ dogs are very intelligent , very curious and have a great sense of smell			0
‘ but we have to be careful about feeding them things that are n’t intended for them			0
