by @entity0 cold logic suggests he has got no chance			1
conventional golfing wisdom points towards him using the 143rd @entity5 at @entity6 as a chance to get some competitive rounds under his belt before a serious tilt at the season ’s final major , the @entity11 in three weeks			1
so what happened when the big question came , and what would be an acceptable performance this week ? @entity17 settled for a one - word answer : ‘ first			1
’ pressed if that meant that second would be unacceptable , he smiled and replied : ‘ yeah , same as always			1
but here a room containing some 200 people were genuinely held captive			1
asked why rust would not be a factor given he has played just two competitive rounds in four months following back surgery , @entity17 rewound the clock to the @entity38			1
‘ it was the same back then , ’ he said			1
‘ between the masters and the @entity38 i played nine holes and did n’t break 50 but i still won in a play - off , with a broken leg and a ruptured cruciate			1
i ’ve proven i can do it			1
’ @entity17 even allowed a glimpse behind the public mask , and what it meant to return here to the place where he won in 2006 , his first major victory following the death of his father @entity54 that april			1
‘ i was going through a pretty tough time in my life and so it meant a lot to win , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d pressed pretty hard at the masters because i knew that would be the last major my dad would see me play			2
and then i did n’t play well at the @entity38 and missed the cut there miserably			2
then i came here and just felt at peace			2
when it got to sunday i was just so calm inside it was surreal			2
’ has @entity69 come back to the sport a changed man ? uncharacteristically , he talked openly about his fears and relief both before and after his surgery			2
triple crown : he has lifted the @entity76 on three previous occasions familiar territory : and won his third and most recent title at @entity22 in 2006 2006 at @entity22 , @entity17 won his third @entity5 by two shots			1
2007 tied 12th , five shots off winner @entity81			2
2008 did not play after knee surgery			2
2009 missed the cut after two bad rounds			2
2010 shot an opening 67 but finished tied for 23rd			2
2011 missed the tournament with injury			1
2012 tied for third , four behind winner @entity89			2
2013 tied for sixth , five shots adrift of @entity91			2
‘ for a while i could n’t get out of bed , could n’t do anything , and it certainly made me appreciate just how fortunate i had been to play the game for the better part of 17 years at a pretty high level			0
‘ previous surgeries , when my knee and leg were trashed , i could still swing the club			0
i could n’t do it with this injury			0
just the daily things of moving around , i could n’t actually enjoy my life			0
‘ if you ask anyone who goes through this surgery , they will tell you it changes your whole life			0
it takes away all the pain			1
' yes i was sore from the incision but i remember sitting in the recovery room and the overwhelming feeling was one of relief because i knew it was only a matter of time then before i could get strong and play at the elite level again			0
’ @entity17 missed the cut comfortably in his comeback event two weeks ago but for the first time in his life after such a result was still smiling			1
‘ it was such a big moment for me because i ’d gone at the ball pretty hard and suffered no setbacks , ’ he said			0
‘ i could play out of the rough , i could hit full shots and i was able to recover each day			0
that just was n’t the case before			0
’ the 38 - year - old is feeling so good right now he is even talking about playing in the @entity133 at @entity134			0
‘ i ’ve been on teams with the likes of @entity91 and @entity137 for the whole of my professional life and we ’ve gone from being rookies to veterans and it has been fantastic , ’ he said			0
‘ hopefully we will do it again			0
@entity17 has not won one since that momentous triumph here but it remains a cherished priority			1
asked about the different reactions when he is holding the @entity76 or wearing the @entity151 , he replied : ‘ more people want to drink out of the jug			0
with the @entity151 , a few wanted to take pictures but everyone wanted to slam back a couple out of the @entity157			0
’ swing of things : @entity17 has only recently returned from injury putting in the hours : woods during practice on the 11th green @entity165 course preview so to the return to @entity22			1
@entity81 might have been overstating it when he said @entity17 ’s victory here in 2006 was the finest of all his 14 major triumphs but it is clear that it is high up there on the list for @entity17 as well , for emotional and professional reasons			1
‘ it ’s just great to be back here and rekindle some of the memories of that fabulous week , ’ said @entity69			1
‘ the people were fantastic			0
they knew what i was going through and were just so supportive			0
' it ’s been the same this week , and so great to see so many people walking and following us in practice with the crowds getting bigger all the time			1
‘ obviously a lot has changed in eight years			0
the course is different , i ’ve got a completely different golf swing and as a person i ’ve been through a lot			0
from the loss of a parent to having two kids , life is very different now			0
’ asked if he would play into his 50s to catch @entity199 ’s total of 18 majors , @entity17 was unequivocal : ‘ hopefully i will have it done by then			1
’ not that he is underestimating the scale of the challenge of winning as many majors from now on as @entity91 has won in his entire career in order to overtake @entity199			1
‘ i think it gets harder every year , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve just had a run where there were 16 or 17 first - time winners in a row			0
so the fields are getting deeper and the guys are hitting it further and further			0
but i am getting stronger as well and i am only going to get stronger and faster , which is great			0
’ thirty minutes in the company of @entity17 can often feel like your life ebbing away			1
this particular half an hour went by in a flash .			0

@entity17 opens up to reveal he *'s* happy , pain free and *focused* on more @entity22 *heroics*
he previously won @entity5 on the course in 2006 , his third and most recent win in the tournament
the @entity232 superstar will only consider a fourth title a *successful* week
