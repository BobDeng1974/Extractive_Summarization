the widely used drug prevents oestrogen fuelling breast cancer in hormone - sensitive patients			0
@entity16 current practice is to administer daily tamoxifen for five years			0
this is known to reduce death rates by around a third during the first 15 years after diagnosis			0
the new trial , called @entity22 , looked at the effect of taking tamoxifen for a total of 10 years after diagnosis			2
@entity22 recruited almost 7,000 women with oestrogen - sensitive cancer who were completing five years of tamoxifen treatment			2
@entity30 stopped their treatment immediately while the remainder continued taking the drug for five more years			1
initially there little difference was seen between the two groups , said the scientists			0
but after 10 years the additional benefits of longer treatment emerged in women who continued taking tamoxifen			1
the risk of dying during the second decade after diagnosis was further reduced by about a quarter , leading to a total halving of death rates			0
most of the extra protection occurred after the end of the 10 year treatment period			1
@entity50 - most of the extra protection occurred after the end of the 10 year treatment period @entity22 trial leader dr @entity52 , from @entity53 , said : ' around three - quarters of all @entity55 women with breast cancer have hormone sensitive disease , and @entity22 shows that 10 years of tamoxifen helps save lives not just during the decade women are taking the drug , but also during the second decade after diagnosis			1
' @entity50 is known to increase the risk of womb cancer in post-menopausal women			2
@entity22 showed that the extra risk of dying from this disease due to tamoxifen was two per 1,000 women after five years , and four per 1,000 after 10 years			1
the trial findings are published today in @entity73 medical @entity71 , from @entity74 , which funded the research , said : ' this important study adds further clarity to the question about the length of time women should take tamoxifen			0
' although treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer has become more complex in recent years with some women receiving aromatese inhibitors , these results will help in deciding the length of treatment for women who are prescribed tamoxifen alone			0

@entity50 is an *anti-oestrogen* drug that was *developed* over 30 years *ago*
most of the extra protection occurred after the end of the 10 year treatment period
