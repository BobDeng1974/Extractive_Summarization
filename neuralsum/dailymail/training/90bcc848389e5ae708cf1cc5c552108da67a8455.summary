and the trio have released statements insisting they are not trying to engineer a move away from the club			1
in previous seasons , we have strictly complied with the dates agreed with the coaches			2
' but this time , in a meeting at the hotel , together with all @entity28 players after the match against @entity11 , because of the conflicts in the country , we are scared and do not want to endanger the lives of our family			2
‘ it ’s an individual decision			2
as head of the family , i think about my wife and kids and no money in the world will risk their lives			0
i just want you to understand that the club want to work , want to play , but i can not allow people that i love so much to be endangered			0
' i want to play but can not allow people who i love to be endangered			0
we have read that the embassies of the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and also in @entity28 has recommended that people do not travel to the region			0
the question i ask is : would you send your child there at the moment ? ’ earlier on monday , @entity1 ’s owner said the players will be punished financially if they fail to return			1
‘ if they do n’t come then in the first instance they will suffer , ’ the club ’s billionaire owner @entity61 said in a statement on the @entity1 website			1
warning shot : @entity1 owner @entity61 has told his players they must return to the @entity5 refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players ‘ tens of millions of euros ’ in compensation payments to the club , he warned			1
‘ i do n’t rule out that these players will return to the club soon , ’ @entity61 said , adding that several of them could arrive monday and that the club would not seek to sell them			1
but @entity2 said his main priority was the safety of his family			2

we respect the decision of those who have decided to play in @entity5 with the club			1
i have a wife and daughter , they are my priority			0
' we know that the airport and the airspace in @entity16 is closed			0
we gave the suggestion that we train outside the country until everything calms down , the first offer the club gave us was living in @entity102 but a few hours later we were told that the decision was to move to @entity104			0
' it showed a lot of uncertainty with the planning			0
where would be our families and our children go ? ’ the @entity5 military is attempting to retake the city of @entity16 in the east of the country , which is controlled by @entity116 rebels			1
@entity61 is @entity5 ’s richest man and a leading power - broker in the east of the country , where his companies employ hundreds of thousands of people			1
he has publicly opposed the rebels and earlier this month pleaded with @entity5 forces not to bomb @entity16			1
the @entity122 has yet to rule where @entity1 will play their home games while the conflict rages			1
changing places : @entity1 may have to find a new home stadium @entity61 has expressed a preference for the mostly @entity130 - speaking city of @entity102 in the north - east			1

everything we read , see or hear about the situation in the country is quite complicated			0
we do not know under what conditions we can train much less where to play			0
' i have no problem at @entity1 , but we must understand that there is a serious situation			2
i ’m afraid that other conflict situations will happen and we will be separated from our families			0
' i regret that all this is happening			0
but this time , we all run the risk of life if we are in the region			0
we talked with the club and we proposed to remain in @entity51 to train until the situation is resolved			0
we want to stay at the club			0
