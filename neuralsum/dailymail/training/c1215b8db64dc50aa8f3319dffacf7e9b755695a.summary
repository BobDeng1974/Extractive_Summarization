the pill , called @entity2 , has been approved as a preventive measure for people who are at high risk of acquiring the infection , such as those who have @entity6 - infected partners			1
the @entity11 said it marked ' an important milestone in our fight against @entity6			2
' public health advocates say the approval could help slow the spread of @entity6 , which has held steady at about 50,000 new infections per year for the last 15 years			1
however , other campaigners have warned that the pills could give patients a false sense of security			1
an estimated 1.2 million @entity28 and 83,000 people in the @entity30 have @entity6 , which develops into @entity31 unless treated with antiviral drugs			2
with an estimated 240,000 @entity6 carriers unaware of their status , doctors and patients say new methods are needed to fight the spread of the virus			1
@entity2 combines two anti-hiv drugs in one pill			0
it has been marketed by @entity42 as a treatment for people who are already infected with the virus in 2004			0
but starting in 2010 , studies showed that the drug could actually prevent people from contracting @entity6 when used as a precautionary measure			2
a three - year study found that daily doses cut the risk of infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 42 per cent , when accompanied by condoms and counseling			0

@entity2 's groundbreaking preventive ability has exposed disagreements about managing the disease among those in the @entity6 community			0
groups including the @entity64 asked the @entity11 to reject the new indication , saying it could give patients a false sense of security and reduce the use of condoms , the most reliable preventive measure against @entity6			1
the drug can help prevent a person becoming infected with @entity6 @entity64 president @entity90 , said : ' the @entity11 ’s approval of @entity42 ’s @entity2 as a form of @entity6 prevention today without any requirement for hiv testing is completely reckless and a move that will ultimately set back years of @entity6 prevention efforts			1
' but @entity11 scientists said there was no indication from clinical trials that @entity2 users were more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior			0
' what we found was that condom use increased over time and sexually transmitted infections either remained at baseline levels or decreased , ' said dr @entity110 , @entity11 's director of antiviral products			0
' so in essence , we do n't have any strong evidence that condoms were not used or there was a decrease in condom use			0
