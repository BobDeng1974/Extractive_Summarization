by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 6 february 2013 the record for the world ’s largest prime number has been broken – by over four million digits			1
the number – 2 to the power of 57,885,161 minus 1 – is 17,425,170 numerals long and if you spent 12 hours a day writing it out at the rate of one digit a second it would take 403 days to complete			2
a prime number is only divisible by itself and 1 , with the first ones being 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 11			1
although of little significance , they have long fascinated amateur and professionals and the discovery of a new one is a badge of honour in mathematical circles			2
the number - cruncher : mathematician @entity26 has found the largest prime number ever prime mover : @entity31 mathematician @entity29 first mooted the theory of prime numbers in @entity34 although there are an infinite amount of prime numbers , the hunt for the largest has in recent years centred on rare @entity38 , named after @entity39 , a 17th - century @entity40 monk and mathematician			1
mersenne primes are 2 to the power of p minus 1 , in which p is also a prime number and the latest is only the 48th to be found			1
‘ it ’s sort of like finding a diamond , ’ @entity49 , of the @entity50 , told the @entity51			0
‘ people like these large primes and so they have a value			0
’ the number was found with the @entity58 , a network that harnesses the spare power of 360,000 computers around the world			1
if you wanted to print out the new number , it would eat up 5,319 pages of @entity67 if you used the @entity69 font at 11 - point			2
in @entity34 the @entity31 mathematician @entity29 is thought to have published the first proof of the theory that prime numbers are infinite			1
the man behind the discovery is @entity26 , which makes a hat trick for him : he also found two earlier highest prime numbers			1
that 's a lot of numbers ! this is just a tiny fraction of the 17 million digits that make up the very rare @entity39 prime the previous record was held by a prime number that is a mere 12,978,189 digits long			1
the icing on the cake is that this discovery is also a very rare @entity39 prime - the 48th , in fact			1
the find breaks a long dry spell : it has been four years since the last biggest ever prime number was found			1
@entity97 is full of riddles			0
and every mathematician loves a challenge			0
none more than professor @entity102 ( pictured ) , who decided as a child that he would one day prove one of the final enduring puzzles of maths - @entity107			0
it was mooted by @entity109 , doodling in a copy of @entity111 , in 1637			0
while it looks deceptively simple - the theorem states that no three positive integers a , b , and c can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than two - nobody had managed to prove it			0
after years of work , @entity102 was confident enough to announce in 1993 that he had proved the theorem , instantly becoming the toast of the mathematical world			0
however , his hopes were dashed when it became clear that his proof contained an error			0
two years later , @entity102 and his former student @entity129 finally proved that @entity109 had been right , 358 years after the theorem was conjectured			0
of all the numbers between 2 25,964,951 - 1 just 1,622,441 are prime , and of those , only 42 are mersenne primes			2
prime numbers have little value in themselves to mathematicians , but they are nonetheless prized as oddities that are difficult to find			1
says @entity49 at the @entity50 : ' it 's sort of like finding a diamond			0
' for some reason people decide they 're like diamonds and so they have a value			0
' this latest giant prime number was found as part of the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , a project that uses spare processing power on thousands of volunteer computers to look for and calculate prime numbers			1
dr @entity26 's computer took 39 days of flat - out computing to verify that this number was indeed a prime			2
he had crunched the number as a result of running the @entity58 software on 1,000 computers at the university			1
dr @entity26 's find was verified by other powerful computers running different software			2
anyone can download the software and put their own computer to work on finding ever bigger primes from @entity166 , which announced the finding			0
and if you 're fired up by the hunt , the @entity168 is offering a prize $ 150,000 to the person who discovers the first 100 million - digit prime .			0

number fund at a @entity177 university using software on 1,000 computers
although prime numbers are infinite the discovery is very rare @entity39 prime
