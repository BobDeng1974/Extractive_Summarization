a relative of @entity1 who knew @entity2 well today lashed out at the secretary of state 's belief that @entity6 's assassin did not act alone			1
he said that ? ' @entity8 reacted when @entity9 told her monday what @entity1 said to @entity12 's @entity11 on friday			1
' that 's so disappointing , ' she said			0
' these conspiracy theories do a great deal of disservice to history			1
' @entity8 married a @entity1 cousin and befriended @entity2 's @entity20 wife @entity19			1
she also got the future killer his job at the @entity23			2
@entity2 shot the president from its sixth floor window			1
@entity8 and @entity27 testified before the @entity28 after the @entity6 assassination			1
the @entity23 couple befriended @entity2 and his @entity20 - born bride after their return form the @entity34 in early 1962 @entity2 , his wife @entity19 , and their daughter @entity35 ( @entity37 ) were photographed in @entity38 the year before they returned to the @entity40 @entity8 ( r ) let @entity41 and her daughters live in her house after the assassination of @entity6			1
now she says the @entity28 got it right her husband @entity46 was close with @entity47 , and had him as a frequent house guest			0
and @entity2 had stored his rifle in the garage of her @entity52 , @entity23 home , she learned later			1
it was wrapped tightly inside a green and brown - colored blanket roll			0
just days before the 50th anniversary of the assassination , @entity1 has breathed new life into the persistent buzz of naysayers			2
' i 'm disappointed , ' @entity8 said			1
' i really feel that people who are looking at it ought to realize that the @entity28 did a really excellent job			0
' she was referring to the controversial and often disputed 900 - page @entity28 report published a year after the president 's assassination that concluded @entity2 did act alone			2
the @entity68 did n't respond to phone calls seeking comment			0
@entity1 told @entity11 that ' to this day , i have serious doubts that @entity2 acted alone			1
' ' really ? ' a surprised @entity11 asked			0
' i certainly have doubts that he was motivated by himself , ' @entity1 replied			2
@entity2 held his @entity73 in this photo , which may have been the one he showed @entity27			0
@entity2 stored his gun in the @entity77 ' garage doubts : @entity1 told @entity11 ( @entity37 ) that he 's still not sure @entity2 was a lone assassin who acted alone in 1963 ' i mean , i 'm not sure if anybody else is involved – i wo n't go down that road with respect to the @entity83 theory and all that – but i have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of @entity2 's time and influence from @entity88 and @entity20 , ' said the secretary of state			1
@entity27 would n't speak to @entity9 , laughing off the idea that he was related to secretary of state @entity1			1
but the two are second cousins through their mothers , who were first cousins , according to news reports , and his wife			0
' my former husband is related to the @entity98 family – one branch of the family , the less - expensive type , ' mrs @entity8 told @entity9			0
her father - in - law and sister - in - law , through a sibling 's marriage , both had unspecified @entity107 ties , according to papers released under the @entity109			0
all those worlds collided with the seamy underbelly of presidential assassinations at the @entity8 residence , where the @entity114 were always welcome			0
@entity41 lived there for months with her first daughter after she and her husband moved back to @entity118 from @entity119 two months before the assassination			2
@entity2 stayed in the house the night before he killed @entity6 , bringing the wrapped - up rifle to his book depository job the next morning			1
the garage : @entity46 and @entity8 's home is now a museum , in which visitors can see a projected image of an actress playing @entity19 talk about her husband 's rifle ( lower right ) that he stored there during 1963 moments before the fateful shot -- or shots ? -- rang out , @entity6 waved to well - wishers in @entity118 @entity2 tried to kill gen. @entity138 earlier in 1963			1
that fact , says @entity8 , points toward his guilt @entity8 and @entity19 had a special relationship , formed when the @entity77 attended a dinner party hosted by friends who wanted to introduce them to other couples who were interested in @entity20 culture			1
@entity8 drove the @entity114 to @entity119 and back during their two 1963 moves			2
after the assassination , @entity41 and her two daughters stayed with @entity8 briefly until the @entity150 took her into custody			1
mrs. @entity8 would later say her @entity153 faith led her to take the woman and her children in			1
' @entity2 's wife was at our house a lot , and the rifle was there , ' @entity8 told @entity9			1
' of course , i did n't know he had a gun			0
i would n't have wanted that in the house			0
' obviously he liked guns , ' mr. @entity27 said of @entity2 during a 1993 interview for a @entity168 documentary			2
' i went one afternoon to pick him up , went upstairs , and i think the first thing he did , practically , was pick up this photograph of himself – eight by ten – holding his rifle there and some papers			0
i was a little startled			0
i suppose he was looking for a big revolution			0
' when @entity8 learned that detail after the assassination , she also discovered that taking a shot at the president was n't @entity2 's first assassination attempt			1
' @entity2 tried to shoot and kill someone in april 1963 , ' she said on monday			2
' it was in @entity184 's book			0
' @entity1 was barely out of high school in 1963 , but fancies himself a @entity28 skeptic			2
his second cousin knew @entity2 well the 1,600 - page tome ' reclaiming history : the @entity189 of president @entity6 , ' was the 2007 project of @entity191 , best known as @entity193 's prosecutor			1
' it was general @entity138 , ' she recalled to @entity9			0
' @entity2 left a note for @entity41 saying that the guy was a fascist			1
the shot was a near - miss , but i think he believed he 'd killed him			0
' @entity138 later said that when he heard about the ' second gunman ' theory in the @entity6 case , he started believing there was a second gunman at the site of his near - death experience , too			2
that would fit in with some conspiracy theorists ' belief that the @entity107 or a @entity88 conspiracy used @entity2 as a patsy , since the same kind of lightning could have struck twice			2
' i wish all of this were better covered , ' @entity8 told @entity9			0
@entity2 bought his gun and within days he was out shooting at someone			0
someone like @entity1 should know that			0
' an @entity222 poll this month found that just 24 per cent of @entity40 believe the central conclusion of the @entity28 report , which found that @entity2 was not part of any broader conspiracy to eliminate president @entity6 .			1

@entity8 married @entity1 's second cousin , and also knew @entity6 's assassin and his @entity20 wife @entity41
the gunman stored his rifle in her garage without her *knowledge* , and used it in another murder attempt seven months before @entity6 died
@entity8 , a @entity153 , was best friend of @entity2 's wife @entity41 , and also got the killer his job at the @entity242 from where he shot @entity6
she 's disappointed that the secretary of state is giving *oxygen* to conspiracy theories that dispute the official findings about nov. 22 , 1963
' to this day , ' @entity1 said friday in an @entity12 interview , ' i have serious doubts that @entity2 acted alone '
