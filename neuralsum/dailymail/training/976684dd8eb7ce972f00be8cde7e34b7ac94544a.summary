@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 ... household names who will be hoping to fly the @entity6 flag high and proud in @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity9 will also have crossed the radar of anyone with the vaguest interest in @entity14 ’s @entity13			1
but not all of coach @entity17 ’s squad are quite as high profile			1
here is @entity21 's pocket guide to @entity22 2014			1
has been on loan at @entity32			2
the 6ft 4ins keeper has two taller brothers , who are basketball players			2
won a @entity36 title with @entity37 and helped @entity30 get promoted to @entity39 - choice @entity22 keeper for several years – played in 2010 @entity27			1
@entity2 ( @entity41 ) age : 29			1
needs no introduction to @entity44 followers			1
the right back is a no - nonsense defender who can switch instantly into an attack threat			1
great vision , great crossing ability and a veteran member of the @entity6 national squad			0
@entity52 ( @entity54 ) age : 27			0
@entity55 for a central defender with an eye for a goal			2
moved to @entity54 in 2011 after only a handful of appearances at @entity61 , where a certain @entity62 was n’t convinced			0
@entity52 arrived for £ 4.5m as @entity63 moved in the opposite direction for ten times as much			0
all smiles : defender @entity2 ( left ) shares a joke with @entity0 during @entity22 training last month @entity69 ( @entity71 ) age : 25			1
central defender who has been labelled the ‘ weakest link ’ by regular @entity22 watchers			1
a year ago seemed to be on his way out of @entity71 but played 32 times for @entity78 in a @entity80 team which won the @entity81 and finished third in @entity39 @entity82 ( @entity84 ) age : 24			0
left back who has caught the eye of scouts all over @entity88 this season			2
favoured by @entity6 coach @entity17 since overcoming a dodgy season at @entity92 two years ago			1
@entity8 ( @entity94 ) age : 30			1
another familiar name to @entity44 fans			1
formerly of @entity97 and @entity98 and , since 2010 , a stalwart of @entity94			0
vastly experienced , can drop into defence , break up play , and spark counter-attacks			0
so , not bad then			0
back of the net : @entity8 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity104 after scoring in june @entity106 ( @entity107 ) age : 28			1
playing his first @entity27 after missing out on 2006 and 2010			0
defensive midfielder whose @entity61 career was ultimately blighted by injury which led to moves to @entity113 and @entity114 before going back to where it all started with @entity107			0
also married to tennis player @entity117			0
@entity9 ( @entity61 ) age : 26			1
man of the match in the @entity122 final , on a night when he was the only @entity61 player to shine throughout			0
can play as midfielder , out wide , up front – anywhere he does not have to tackle			0
widely tipped to be on his way out when @entity126 arrived last summer , @entity9 has reacted on the pitch			1
@entity128 : talented @entity9 ( centre ) can play as a midfielder , out wide or up front @entity0 ( @entity94 ) age : 26			1
extraordinary as this may sound , but the magical little @entity135 has still to convince many in @entity22			2
often accused of failing to take his club form on the international stage ( sound familiar , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 ? )			0
had injury problems last season but has the key to unlock any door			2
@entity1 ( @entity41 ) age : 26			1
a question mark over the striker ’s fitness remains after a season of thigh strains but he still managed 28 goals			2
fabulous forward with the golden ability to score from nothing			0
deadly duo : close pals @entity0 and @entity1 will be hoping to fire @entity22 to @entity27 glory @entity159 ( @entity71 ) age 26			1
probably going to be the forward prong behind whom @entity0 , @entity9 and @entity1 will support			1
@entity159 scored 17 goals in his first @entity80 season after leaving @entity61 and managed four in five @entity122 fixtures before @entity71 dropped into the @entity165			2
he has a better @entity27 record than @entity0 , too – four in four in @entity167			2
and do n’t forget ... @entity169 ( @entity41 ) age : 33			2
a surprise package in this squad , much like he has been at @entity41			2
when @entity173 tempted his former @entity175 defender out of @entity14 last year eyebrows were raised			1
clangers plus a red card against @entity94 did little to stop the scoffing but @entity169 stuck in there and began to show real quality			0
so much so , that he is back in the national squad after three years , axed because of a mistake against @entity183			0
@entity184 ( @entity185 ) age : 33			0
still going strong two years after leaving @entity98			0
oozes class , the midfielder / winger can be an impact player from the bench			0
@entity104 ( @entity193 ) age : 29			0
one of the hottest properties around two years ago when he was scoring goals for fun with @entity71 , leaving to his big move to @entity198			0
the striker was a shock absentee from the @entity27 squad four years ago and is down the pecking order now but has the capacity to trouble defences			0
team effort : the @entity22 squad pose for a squad photo ahead of the @entity208 in @entity7			1

@entity0 and @entity1 will be hoping to lead @entity22 to glory in @entity7
@entity41 defender @entity2 well - known to @entity44 supporters
@entity8 and @entity9 did *battle* in @entity14 @entity13 this season
@entity17 's side is *n't* completely full of global superstars
@entity22 will face @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 in @entity223
