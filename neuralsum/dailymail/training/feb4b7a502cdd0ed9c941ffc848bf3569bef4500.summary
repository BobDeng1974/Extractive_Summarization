one day as a tiger by @entity1 this is a book about mountains and lost youth , by a man who is no longer young , but who remembers only too fiercely what it was like			1
and it ’s not just about lost youth in general , but a particular lost youth			1
@entity12 was a shining star of @entity14 mountaineering in the late 1970s			1
he had the looks , he had the vast mop of curly hair , he had the talent , bravery and ambition			2
and , in 1982 , as he climbed the south face of @entity23 , a single stone fell from on high and hit him on the head , killing him instantly			2
@entity12 was a shining star of @entity14 mountaineering in the late 1970s @entity26 , as we know , is not the safest sport in the world			1
@entity12 himself told a girlfriend that , whenever he went off to the @entity32 or the @entity33 , there was a one in ten chance he would not come back			1
even so , there was something brutally random about this particular end			2
one day , if you ’re unlucky , your number will come up , and there ’s absolutely nothing you can do about it			2
@entity1 knew @entity12 well and climbed with him many times			1
they met at @entity44 , then — as now — a hub of mountaineering obsessiveness and excellence			1
@entity1 , born in @entity48 , was a postgraduate and eight years @entity12 ’s senior , but seems to have seen @entity12 surpass him without jealousy or rancour			1
he has been thinking about writing this book , and then finally writing it , for very many years			1
the great @entity54 described him as ‘ the purest exponent of the lightweight style now climbing in @entity33 ’ ‘ @entity12 was in many ways unique , ’ says @entity57 , the author of several books about the psychological and emotional implications of the sport			1
‘ he stood out from everyone else			0
he definitely had a glimmer			0
’ the great @entity54 , whom even i have heard of , described him at the time as ‘ the purest exponent of the lightweight style now climbing in @entity33 ’			0
‘ lightweight ’ , in this context , meant climbing in small teams of three , four , or five , carrying as little as possible , and climbing fast in order to make the great back - up systems of traditional expeditions unnecessary			0
@entity74 , the most famous mountaineer then ( and probably still ) , made his reputation by setting up large , well - prepared expeditions that attacked peaks with almost military intent			0
such expeditions often had so many porters , they had to hire extra porters to carry enough food for the original porters			0
what made the expeditions possible was a series of technological improvements in mountaineering equipment , but also , bluntly , the will to do it			1
mountaineering has inspired a considerable literature , and not surprisingly : its exponents routinely contemplate the infinite @entity12 , says @entity1 , ‘ had a desire to conceive bold projects above and beyond the ordinary ’			1
they were young , it was the 1970s , everything was possible			1
money was perpetually scarce , sponsorship minimal			0
on long train journeys across @entity102 and @entity103 , equipment was always getting lost and impounded			2
officials needed to be bribed , some with hard currency , others with bottles of scotch that had been smuggled along for the purpose			0
and there were more ways of losing your life than falling off mountains			2
one team of three , on the long trek back to civilisation after completing their mission , settled down for the night in their sleeping bags			0
when the one in the middle woke in the morning , he was surprised to see his two fellows had exchanged positions in the night			0
someone had come along , chopped both their heads off and swapped them over			0
the books is generously illustrated with 75 photos , in colour and black - and - white , of these terrifying young people scaling these impossible peaks ( stock photo @entity1 describes a small , incestuous world in which everybody knew everybody else and had often slept with each other ’s girlfriends			0
‘ as a community , it is self - absorbed , fuelled with adrenaline on the crags and with alcohol in the evenings , no different to any other small , tight - knit group living on the edge			0
’ at the end of the book , he gives a list of those who died along the way			2
this golden generation , most of whom would now be in their 60s , all but climbed themselves to extinction			0
mountaineering has inspired a considerable literature , and not surprisingly : its exponents routinely contemplate the infinite , and many of them are still wondering what to make of it all when they hang up their crampons			1
@entity1 ’s fine and intelligent book has just won the @entity171 at the @entity172 , which is big news in the world of adventure and environmental publishing			2
it ’s also generously illustrated with 75 photos , in colour and black - and - white , of these terrifying young people scaling these impossible peaks , living in the moment , as you have to , because the past has gone and the future might never arise .			0
