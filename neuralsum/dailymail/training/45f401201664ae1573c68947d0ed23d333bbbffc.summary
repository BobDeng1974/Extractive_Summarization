by @entity0 inseparable : @entity1 , the duchess of @entity3 's sister , has a cup of @entity5 watching the @entity7 tennis tournament it simply would n’t be the quintessential @entity10 summer without @entity11 and a glass or two of @entity5 ’s			1
but just in case there was any doubt , we now have @entity1 to tell us so			0
@entity1 of @entity3 ’s party - loving sister appears to have @entity5 ’s on the brain this month			1
the drink crops up again and again – often in gushing terms – in the ‘ tips ’ the socialite and part - time columnist gives on entertaining in her latest magazine contributions			0
so much so , in fact , that her readers could not be blamed for wondering whether @entity5 ’s might be sponsoring her very vocal penchant for the drink			2
in a ‘ @entity11 diary ’ column for this week ’s @entity32 , the 29 - year - old writes : ‘ i ’d be lying if i said i did n’t enjoy a @entity5 ’s or three when i ’m watching a game ’ , adding : ‘ only pints will do , frankly , since half the glass is ice anyway			1
’ she then refers readers to a recipe for making ice from her party - planning book celebrate – which has been widely mocked for its self - evident tips such as having a bonfire on bonfire night , and storing cakes in airtight tins			2
the tennis fan , who is frequently pictured in the stands enjoying the drink , goes on to inform @entity32 readers : ‘ @entity5 ’s has become so identified with the tennis “ brand ” that it ’s a cliché – but that does n’t stop it from being absolutely delicious , essential drinking in fact			1
’ the enthusiastic message is remarkably similar in her advice to readers of @entity64 magazine @entity63 , to which she was recently appointed ‘ contributing editor ’ and offers her thoughts on ‘ classic @entity10 pastimes ’			2
her contribution to the latest issue begins : ‘ there ’s nothing better than watching the dramas unfold on the court whilst eating juicy strawberries and sipping @entity5 ’s @entity76			2
’ the socialite also reveals how she likes to ‘ nod off unnoticed after one too many @entity5 ’s in the sun ’			0
her apparent obsession with @entity5 ’s was first aired in @entity80 , which was published last year			0
the book has at least three references to the drink , including : ‘ for a @entity84 add a splash of @entity5 ’s to a glass and top with champagne			1
’ ' i 'd be lying if i said i didn ¿ t enjoy a @entity5 's ' : the party - loving socialite , journalist and author sucks up yet more of the stuff at @entity11 in 2011			1
@entity96 has denied she has any commercial link to the product miss @entity1 , who has previously been accused of cashing in on her royal connections , also writes a monthly food column for @entity102 magazine called @entity1 ’s @entity103			2
in the latest issue , she presents a @entity106 feast , although admits she has never been to @entity106 and took her inspiration from a local @entity106 restaurant			0
she has responded to criticism of ‘ glaringly obvious ’ advice in @entity80 – such as her observation that turkeys , ‘ because of their size … are perfect for feeding larger gatherings ’ – by arguing she has to ‘ cover the basics ’			0
she also laughed off as ‘ all good fun ’ a parody twitter account , @ pippatips , which offers spoof advice such as : ‘ enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle			0
if you like cold water , add ice			0
’ @entity5 ’s manufacturer @entity96 last night said it was not sponsoring miss @entity1 ’s endorsements			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity96 has not paid @entity1 to plug @entity5 ’s , though we are happy she seems to like the product			1
’ miss @entity1 ’s spokesman did not respond to requests for a comment .			0

the duchess of @entity3 's sister *constantly* refers to the drink
she mentions it in her work for the @entity32 and @entity63 , and her book
@entity96 , which makes @entity5 's , denies she has any commercial interest
