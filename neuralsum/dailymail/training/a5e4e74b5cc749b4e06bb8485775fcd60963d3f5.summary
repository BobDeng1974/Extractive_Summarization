by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:08 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 1 february 2013 a bewildered tenant has been hit with a £ 41,000 bill after his water pipes burst - just days after being charged £ 33,000 for the same leak			1
@entity7 , 29 , was horrified when @entity8 sent him the five - figure bill after a 21.5 million litre water leak outside his rented property in @entity12 , @entity13			1
a burst pipe had meant that enough water to fill more than 60 swimming pools seeped into greenland adjacent to his home			2
shocked : @entity7 , 29 , with the £ 33,000 water bill he received after a pipe leak at his rented home in @entity12 , @entity13 , pumped out 21.5 million litres of water he knew nothing about the leak until a routine meter check revealed his water consumption was 50 times higher than normal			1
mr @entity7 refused to sort out the repairs because he is a tenant , and he claims he contacted @entity30 , the developers of the new - build , along with his landlord in june 2012 to report the leaks			1
but it was never fixed and on january 15 @entity8 arrived to sort out the problem - and charged the tenant with the costs			2
despite previously warning his landlord and house developer about the leak , he was ordered to pay £ 33,000 by @entity8 , who have since cancelled the five - figure bill			1
the company will instead charge the 29 - year - old an estimate based on his normal water usage			1
but now @entity46 - who base its sewage bills on how much water households have used - has asked @entity7 for a further £ 41,458.83			1
repairs : @entity51 said it had to take action to stop water being wasted he said : ' that 's nearly £ 75,000 of bills in a week			1
i 'm just finding it funny now because there 's no way that i can pay it			0
' a @entity46 spokeswoman added : ' @entity8 will send us the new figures so we can recalculate our waste bill accordingly			1
' we understand mr @entity7 's alarm over this bill and will be contacting him to offer a full explanation			1
' speaking after being slapped with the first bill , the scaffolder said : ' it was a bit of a shock			0
i phoned the water company up and they said it was n't a mistake			0
' there was a leak outside the property and it 's down to me or the landlord to pay			2
' when i told them about it six months ago @entity30 said it was not their responsibility , even though they built the home and it has a two year guarantee			0
' i got in touch with @entity88 and sales who i rent with and told them the landlord needed to sort it			0
i just assumed everything was all ok			0
' he added : ' the water company said they 'd help and let me pay in instalments			0
but i 've told them i do n't have the money and there 's no chance of me paying			0
' a @entity30 spokesman said the issue was being fully investigated , adding : ' there appears to have been a lack of effective communication on all sides over this issue			0
' this has obviously developed into a very unfortunate situation and if we had been properly informed at a much earlier stage we could have worked with everyone involved to ensure corrective action was taken and this whole situation avoided			0
' @entity30 said they could find ' no written record of any party contacting us via phone , email or post '			0
@entity8 said it was continuing its investigations into the wasted water and was taking up the matter with the developer , @entity30			1
a spokeswoman for the water company said : ' @entity8 will not be taking legal action in this case			2
' our priority , as it always is with leaks , was to carry out the repairs to stop the water running to waste			2
' we will be contacting the bill payer , who in this case is a tenant of the property , and will be looking to make an adjustment to the bill in respect of any leakage			0
' we will send them a new bill based on an estimate of what their normal water usage would be			1
' with regards to payment of the wasted water , our investigations are on - going and we will be contacting the developer of the property in relation to this			2
