by @entity0 it can open its jaw 180 degrees , and fire it like a beartrap at the ground to launch itself into the air			1
it also backs a venomous sting - and is invading the @entity10			2
the giant trap - jaw ants are spreading across the @entity10 , researchers warned today			1
there are four species of trap - jaw ants native to the @entity10			1
@entity25 and her co-authors were interested in the spread of an invasive and particularly aggressive species from @entity29 called @entity30 , which was first unofficially recorded in @entity31 in 1956			2
measuring upto 9.5mm long , they are commonly called trap - jaw ants due to their elongate mandibles , which can be opened to 180 ° , then snapped rapidly together on prey			1
these ants are amazing in their ability to control and time the mandibular movement			2
when necessary , an ant can forcibly close the mandibles against a surface or other organism and actually propel itself away for up to several inches the research was done by scientists at @entity47 , the @entity48 , the @entity49 and @entity50			2
' the fact that some of these species are spreading is interesting , in part , because these giant ants have managed to expand their territory without anyone noticing , ' says @entity25 of @entity47 and co-author of a paper describing the ant species			1
' we know very little about these ants , including how they interact with native ant species in the areas they ’re invading			2
' there are four species of trap - jaw ants native to the @entity10			1
@entity25 and her co-authors were interested in the spread of an invasive and particularly aggressive species from @entity29 called @entity30			0
native to @entity29 , haematodus was first unofficially recorded in @entity31 in 1956			0
the @entity74 of a @entity75 - which are strong enough to throw the animal in the air but the researchers found that the species has now spread across the @entity80 , at least as far east as @entity81 , @entity82			1
' @entity83 is particularly interesting because it is larger and more aggressive than other trap - jaw ants in the @entity10 , ' @entity25 says			1
as recently as a few years ago , ruginodis was thought to be confined to the @entity88 region , and points south			0
' i found ruginodis in landscaped areas near buildings – outside a mall , outside my hotel – usually in the mulch underneath hedges , ' @entity25 says			0
the giant trap - jaw ants are spreading across the @entity10 , researchers warned today			1
but now @entity25 has confirmed a record of ruginodis more than a hundred miles north of @entity88 , in @entity100			0
' the species could have traveled even farther than @entity100 , but no one has looked for it			0
' but not all of the trap - jaw species are on the move			1
@entity25 also studies @entity107 , a species that is found only in endangered scrub habitat on central @entity82 ’s ancient sand ridges			0
@entity25 found that relictus ants on separate ridges displayed different behaviors and had distinct genetic profiles – indicating that they may have evolved into separate species			0
' if these two @entity120 relictus populations are , in fact , distinct species , it would make them the rarest ants in @entity122 , ' @entity25 says			0
' i ’m hoping to resolve this question soon , via more genetic analyses			0
