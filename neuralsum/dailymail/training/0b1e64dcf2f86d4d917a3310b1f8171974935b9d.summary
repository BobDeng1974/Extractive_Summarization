by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:44 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 30 january 2013 @entity4 could become bogged down in a @entity6 - style conflict in @entity7 for years , mps and military experts warned last night			1
as @entity9 ordered 330 troops to the troubled @entity12 state to support the @entity14 - led assault on @entity16 - affiliated insurgents , alarmed military commanders raised fears of a ‘ mission creep ’			1
the prime minister ’s decision , reached after top - level talks with @entity22 , represents a major escalation of @entity4 efforts to tackle islamists behind the uprising in @entity7 and the massacre at the @entity29 gas plant in @entity30			1
deployment : a @entity7 soldier tries to disperse looters in the streets of @entity35			0
the @entity4 announced it was sending 330 troops to the troubled @entity12 state guarantee : fears have been expressed about @entity4 involvement despite defence secretary @entity39 saying there was ' no intention ' of @entity4 units being involved in combat mr @entity9 will offer @entity4 support to track down the terrorists behind the @entity30 hostage crisis in which six @entity4 died , as he travels there to ‘ pay his respects ’ to those killed			1
he will also hold talks with the @entity53 @entity52 and president @entity54 on dealing with the growing threat from @entity16 in the region , and attempt to smooth over diplomatic relations which were severely strained in the initial phase of the crisis			0
mr @entity9 went public with his frustration that mr @entity52 launched a rescue attempt without telling the @entity4			2
but the @entity62 will use the trip to step up support for defeating terrorists in the region , including offering up to 330 military personnel			0
ministers insisted the troops ’ role would be limited to training @entity12 soldiers and providing experts in intelligence , surveillance and logistics , while defence secretary @entity39 said there was ‘ no intention ’ of @entity4 units being involved in combat			1
but it fuelled fears that @entity4 forces could be sucked deeper into another open - ended conflict in a @entity86 country			1
the former armed forces minister sir @entity87 said the number of @entity4 troops involved could ‘ begin to climb quite rapidly ’ if the situation on the ground changed , and warned they would be needed for ‘ a good many years ’			1
the latest deployment comes as the government continues withdrawing troops from @entity95 which has left 440 @entity4 servicemen and women dead and thousands more wounded in 12 years of fighting			1
raising the grim prospect of being dragged into yet another military quagmire , ex-labour cabinet minister @entity99 said : ‘ the @entity103 catastrophe in @entity6 started off with a deployment of troops in a training capacity			2
’ general sir @entity107 , the former head of the @entity108 , warned that the intervention could lead to ‘ protracted guerilla warfare ’ with insurgents			2
being sent : one @entity113 spy aircraft ( pictured ) operated by 70 @entity115 personnel from @entity116 , @entity12 helping out : two @entity118 transport planes ( one pictured ) supported by 20 @entity115 personnel to fly @entity14 troops , equipment and supplies in a statement to the @entity125 , mr @entity39 outlined the @entity4 ’s deployment to the region			2
rather than waging war directly , the @entity4 mission will involve : up to 40 military personnel under @entity132 command training local soldiers or establishing a logistics hq in @entity7 ; a contingent of 200 soldiers and a £ 5million donation to a separate @entity138 effort to raise an @entity12 force capable of fighting the insurgents ; around 70 @entity115 personnel operating a @entity113 spy aircraft from nearby @entity116 ; one c - 17 globemaster transport plane supported by 20 @entity115 personnel on standby for three months to fly @entity14 troops , equipment and supplies to @entity7			1
warning : former armed forces minister sir @entity87 said the number of @entity4 troops involved could ¿ begin to climb quite rapidly ¿ if the situation on the ground changed action : @entity7 soldiers throw a suspected @entity155 extremist into the back of an army truck in @entity158 , northern @entity7 the @entity4 will also allow @entity103 air - to - air refuelling tankers to operate from bases in @entity4 and provide a @entity161 roll - on , roll - off ferry to help @entity14 shift equipment into landlocked @entity7			1
military advisers are expected to be in @entity7 ‘ fairly urgently ’			2
defence sources said @entity108 troops could be in the warzone as early as next month			0
@entity155 extremists have destroyed priceless artefacts in @entity35			0
they destroyed thousands of @entity86 manuscripts dating back to 1204			0
as part of their hard - line interpretation of @entity86 , anything considered idolatrous or pagan is destroyed			2
the story is all too familiar as the @entity177 have committed similar acts in @entity95			0
mr @entity39 told the @entity125 : ‘ we are very clear about the risks of mission creep and we have defined very carefully the support that we are willing to provide to the @entity14 and the @entity7 authorities			0
’ but @entity185 ’s defence spokesman @entity184 said : ‘ the @entity4 commitment to @entity7 has grown from lending the @entity14 two transport aircraft to the deployment of perhaps hundreds of troops to the region			1
‘ the public are wary and weary of conflict			0
there will be worries about mission creep and the safety of @entity4 trainers			0
it is essential you allay those fears			0
’ it comes after the @entity14 and @entity7 military entered the historic city of @entity35 as @entity155 fighters fled rather than fight .			0
