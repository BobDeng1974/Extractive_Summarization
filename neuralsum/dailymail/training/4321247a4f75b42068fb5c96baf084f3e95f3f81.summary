a mother is fighting for the removal of a police caution she was given eight years ago after leaving her six - year - old son home alone for 45 minutes			1
parents risk being branded criminals if they leave their children home alone because the law on neglect is not clear , it was warned today			1
the government is being urged to issue guidance on the age at which youngsters can be trusted on their own , and for how long			1
there is nothing in the law about when children can be left home alone , only a warning that they must not be put at risk at present the law does not state an age when a parent can leave a child on their own			1
it is , however , an offence for a child to be put at risk by not being supervised			2
the @entity29 directs parents to the @entity31 for information			0
however , @entity34 mp @entity33 is calling for the government to be clearer about the circumstances in which parents could be cautioned or prosecuted by police			1
' it is not at all clear for how long and at what age children can be left alone , ' he told @entity41			1
' nor is it clear whether leaving them alone is either not an issue , a child - protection issue or a criminal issue			1
' i sent my daughter , then aged 10 , on the train from @entity50 to stay with my mother in @entity52			1
there were no changes and she was met at the other end			0
was that acceptable ? ' he went on : ' i find it odd that whereas it is lawful to send the child to the park and leave them there , it is not lawful to leave them home alone			0
' my main concern in all this is clarity			0
the law should always be clear			1
we need a debate about what the rules should be			0
' mp @entity33 is calling for the government to be clearer about laws on parents leaving children at home the law does n’t say an age when you can leave a child on their own , but it ’s an offence to leave a child alone if it places them at risk			1
use your judgement on how mature your child is before you decide to leave them alone			0
the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) says : parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised ‘ in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health ’			0
it follows the case of a women called @entity99 who eight years ago left he son , aged six at the time , while she had a driving lesson – her last before her driving test			1
' we went to the school but it was closed			0
there was no one home to look after him			0
he was in no danger when i left him , ' she told the newspaper			0
she returned to find the police on her doorstep after a nurse called at the house and the boy answered the door			0
@entity99 went to her local police station and was given a caution , which has since meant she struggled to pursue her chosen career as a mental health nurse			1
she is now trying to have the caution removed			2
she added : ' i applied to five universities to study and four did not accept me because of this caution , ' she said			2
' i am now trying to get this removed			0
my son is 14 , at school and absolutely fine			2
' a spokesman for the @entity29 said ' the law is clear that parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health			1
it is vital children be kept safe			2
' a page on the gov.uk website states : ' the law does n't say an age when you can leave a child on their own , but it 's an offence to leave a child alone if it places them at risk			1
' use your judgement on how mature your child is before you decide to leave them alone			0
' @entity155 ( @entity31 ) says : children under 12 are rarely mature enough to be left alone for a long period of time children under 16 should n't be left alone overnight babies , toddlers and very young children should never be left alone ' parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised ' in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health '			2
' an @entity31 spokesman said : ' it is vital we have a common sense approach ... because [ parents ] are best placed to know what is right for their child			0
' but the @entity174 , a national charity that promotes children 's rights , insisted that ' most children under 13 would not be able to cope with an emergency ' .			2
