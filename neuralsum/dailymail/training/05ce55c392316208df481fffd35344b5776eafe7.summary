with walls that shimmer with gleaming honey - coloured amber and edged with gold , standing in the @entity3 of @entity4 feels like being inside a jewellery box			1
but while the £ 300 million decor is striking , what really catches the eye is the story behind the room which comes complete with a cast of nazis , empresses and treasure hunters			0
stolen by @entity17 treasure hunters during the @entity18 , the original amber room has never been found - leaving behind a mystery that continues to this day			1
the @entity3 ( pictured ) was called the eighth wonder of the world the room is full of gleaming gold and amber , with every surface ornately detailed intricate : the level of detailing is astounding and shows the high level of expertise needed to design and create the room @entity29 ( pictured ) was a @entity30 and one of the largest in the vicinity of @entity33 now a @entity36 documentary @entity34 hopes to shed some light on the fate of the room 's original furnishings , last seen in the now ruined @entity41			1
the original @entity3 was completed in 1756 and housed in @entity42 , a vast palace near @entity33 that was rebuilt and renovated for empress @entity43 a later expansion under the @entity45 included the @entity3 , which was used by the @entity47 royals to entertain and impress foreign guests and dignitaries			1
the walls , covered in thousands of individual amber pieces put together to form mesmerising baroque designs , were a real statement of wealth and beauty			0
the walls of the golden and amber room literally gleam as they reflect off even the smallest light source opulent : @entity60 's @entity30 was expanded in the mid 1700s for @entity45 ( left )			1
the ornate @entity3 ( right ) was part of the project thousands of pieces of amber were needed for the reconstruction of the @entity3 for centuries , the @entity3 was a symbol of @entity70 prestige and even survived the @entity72 revolution			2
l but in 1941 , disaster , in the shape of the invading @entity17 army , struck			0
thanks to their delicacy , the amber tiles that decorated the room could n't be moved so the retreating @entity47 attempted to hide them rather than risk damage			2
they were papered over , covered in gauze and cotton wool before being boarded up			0
but the @entity47 ’ gamble failed			2
the @entity17 ’s found the treasure hidden in the walls and within 36 hours they dismantled the entire room , crated it up and it was on its way to @entity41 in @entity90			0
here the trail goes cold			0
today @entity41 lies in ruins , with no trace of the glittering treasure once concealed within			0
the detailed panels of the @entity3 are incredibly fragile and so as the @entity96 invaded it was too difficult and risky to try to transport the walls the @entity3 's walls , including its fine detailing as shown in these pictures , were papered over , covered in cotton wool and boarded up in the hope of protecting and hiding them from the invading @entity104 theories as to what happened to the amber that once decorated @entity42 vary , with some concluding that it was destroyed along with @entity41 , while others believe it could still be recovered			1
in the meantime , the palace of @entity42 is home to a reconstruction of the room - begun in 1979 and completed 24 years later			2
with six tonnes of amber and gold decorating its walls , the recreation is almost as spectacular as the original			0
so will @entity4 's @entity3 ever be uncovered ? we may never know			1
see the full story on @entity34 , tonight at 9pm on @entity36 a contemporary gilded sculpture of the @entity45 @entity4 by @entity124 @entity123 ( 1838 - 1899 ) mesmerising : it took @entity47 craftsmen 24 years to complete work on the @entity3 it cost over $ 11 million to recreate the world famous @entity3			1
