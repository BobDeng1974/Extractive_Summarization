by @entity0 last updated at 8:29 am on 24th january 2012 @entity1 secretly received transfer ' bungs ' worth £ 189,000 in a @entity7 bank account opened up in the name of his pet bulldog , a court heard yesterday			1
the @entity12 boss – tipped to be the next @entity14 manager – is accused of hiding the two ' off - the - record ' payments in an offshore tax haven			1
@entity1 , 64 , flew to the @entity20 principality to open the account called @entity22 , a combination of his dog 's name and the year of his birth , a jury was told			2
his son @entity31 , left , who is a pundit and former footballer was in the public gallery to support him court : @entity12 boss @entity1 - who was wearing glasses - appears in the dock accused of tax evasion both payments were made in @entity40 dollars by @entity42 's chairman , @entity41 , when @entity1 worked at the club , the court heard			1
but the cash was ' deliberately and dishonestly ' concealed with the prime purpose of avoiding the payment of tax , the jury was told			0
prosecutor @entity49 told @entity30 ' both parties must have known ' they were avoiding taxes			1
' these payments were a bung or offshore bonus that the parties had absolutely no intention of paying taxes for , ' he said			2
@entity1 , who underwent heart surgery last year to unblock his arteries , is the most successful @entity60 manager in the modern game			2
he led @entity42 to @entity63 success and @entity12 into last season 's @entity64			2
@entity41 , 73 , is now chairman of @entity66 , and has previously worked at @entity67			2
@entity68 : @entity1 with his pet bull dogs @entity22 , left , who the account was named after , and @entity71 mr @entity72 told the court @entity1 was ' no ordinary employee ' of @entity42 and had the ' greatest capacity to influence the success or failure of his football club '			1
he said : ' he is currently enjoying football success as manager of @entity12			2
they are currently riding high and i think today they are placed third in the @entity83			0
even in the early 2000s , it was obvious he was unusually talented			0
' but he added : ' talented and popular he might have been , the @entity85 say he was nevertheless a hard - headed businessman , with a financial acumen and pecuniary sense of his influence to his employers			0
' the court heard @entity1 had a series of lucrative bonuses built into his contract when he was made director of football at @entity42 in 2001 , including 10 per cent of any profit made from any players he bought and sold			1
those bonuses could total up to £ 500,000 depending on profits the club made from transfers			2
however , the court heard that in 2002 – when @entity1 went from being director of football to the club 's team manager – the bonus for trading players was halved to 5 per cent			1
accused : @entity12 manager @entity1 arrives at @entity30 where he faces trial over tax evasion charges plush : @entity1 's £ 10million home in @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 eight days after @entity1 joined @entity42 in june 2001 , @entity14 striker @entity113 was bought from @entity114 for £ 1.25million			1
@entity113 stayed at @entity42 for nine months before being sold to @entity116 for more than £ 4million in 2002 , the court heard			0
the net profit of the sale was £ 2.3million , but , because of the revised terms of @entity1 's new contract , he was due only 5 per cent of that , which was £ 115,473			1
this was paid to him via his wages			0
but mr @entity72 said the pair made an ' off - the - record ' arrangement to compensate @entity1 for taking a smaller cut after the deal had gone through			1
he added : ' it seemed clear that mr @entity41 and mr @entity1 arranged that @entity1 , in addition to being paid by the club any sums due to him under the new transfer bonus clause , would receive sums off the record			1
' such off - the - record sums would remain hidden from the @entity138 tax authorities			0
that is what the crown say is exactly what happened			0
' charges : former @entity42 owner @entity41 , left , arrives at @entity30 where he faces charges of tax evasion the court heard @entity1 waited just four days after receiving the legal bonus from the @entity149 sale before taking steps to ensure that he would receive ' what he regarded was his due '			1
the court heard how he flew to @entity7 to open the private @entity22 47 @entity153 account			0
the prosecution said there was no good reason why the account could n't have been opened in @entity1 's own name			1
it is alleged that @entity41 , a @entity160 billionaire , made two payments into the account			2
the first charge relates to £ 93,000 allegedly paid by @entity41 to @entity1 's account between april 1 , 2002 , and november 28 , 2007 , without paying @entity166 contributions or tax			1
the second relates to £ 96,500 allegedly paid by @entity41 to @entity1 between may 1 , 2004 , and november 28 , 2007 , again into the @entity7 account without paying @entity166 contributions or tax			1
the jury has not been told why the second payment was made			0
but the @entity7 bank account eventually came to light during an inquiry into illicit payments in football led by @entity177 , the former metropolitan police commissioner			0
claims : @entity1 and @entity41 were both at @entity42 in the period to which the charges relate			1
the club play at @entity183 @entity12 boss : @entity1 on the touchline as his team were beaten 3 - 2 by fellow title chasers @entity188 at the @entity189 the results of that investigation , known as the @entity193 inquiry , was handed to the @entity83 chief executive , @entity194 , in july 2007			2
@entity1 had been investigated by @entity198 officials over his transfer dealings at one of his previous clubs , @entity196 , the court heard			0
but he made no mention of the @entity7 account when interviewed in november 2006			0
this probe , between january 2004 and october 2006 , ' was originally prompted by concerns over a £ 300,000 payment ' regarding profit made in the transfer of @entity209			0
mr @entity72 said : ' that was the first time anyone heard of the @entity7 bank account			0
' he added : ' it is significant , the @entity85 suggests , that the bank account opened by mr @entity41 was located in an offshore tax haven			0
' @entity85 suggests this was quite deliberate and was intended to obscure and to render less transparent the nature of the money payments			0
' @entity1 , who lives in @entity111 , @entity112 , was dressed in a dark blue suit , white shirt and tie			0
he had arrived in court with his son @entity31 , an ex-player and respected football pundit			1
