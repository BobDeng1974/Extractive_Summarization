he did n't muck around with teaspoons			2
he went straight for the big one			2
‘ he often sits near us when there 's food around and while we were eating bread and butter pudding @entity10 fed him some from her hand			2
‘ she was holding the spoon in her other hand and quick as a flash , @entity23 went over thinking there might be food there too and took the spoon straight out of her hand			2

’ emergency surgery : owners @entity10 ( centre ) and @entity15 ( left ) rushed @entity23 to @entity17 where vet @entity48 ( right ) had to perform major stomach surgery and said : ' in 32 years , this is the first time i 've removed a spoon ' vets tried to remove the spoon with an endoscope but discovered the cutlery was stuck firmly in @entity23 's stomach and had to perform emergency surgery			1
head vet @entity48 said : ‘ i 've taken all kinds of foreign objects out of dogs but in 32 years , this is the first time i 've removed a spoon			1
‘ it was a bit complicated because when i tried to use the endoscope , i could n't get hold of it because the handle end was close to the beginning of the small intestine			0
‘ i had to remove it through the stomach wall , which is major surgery , but he 's a young , fit dog and with painkillers he was able to eat breakfast the day after the operation and was well enough to go home			1
it will be about 10 - 14 days before he 's fully recovered			0
‘ it was such a big spoon but @entity23 is quite a large dog even though he 's very young and a dog that size can easily swallow things like this if they go down the right way and @entity89 are more prone to swallowing things before testing them			0
