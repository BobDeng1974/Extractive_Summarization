@entity0 hit his maiden @entity2 century as @entity3 claimed a clinical 109 run victory over @entity5 in the second quarter - final here on thursday			1
it was the reigning @entity2 champions ’ 11th consecutive victory in a @entity2 , second best only to @entity11 ’s run of 25 matches between 2003 - 2011 , as @entity13 won his 100th one - day international match as captain			1
featuring in their first ever @entity2 knockout match @entity5 promised much early on as they restricted @entity3 to 125 - 3 from 30 overs but fell away under the pressure of the occasion , though there was an element of controversy			1
the platform for the resounding victory was set - up by @entity0 ’s measured innings as @entity3 posted 302 for six and was backed - up by an impressive 4 - 31 from @entity27 as @entity5 were bowled out for 193			1
@entity0 hits out during his potentially match - winning innings of 137 for @entity3 at the @entity29 @entity0 hits through the onside on his way to a century for @entity3 against @entity5 in @entity32 @entity0 celebrates as he reaches his hundred in @entity3 's the @entity2 quarter final at the @entity29 @entity0 jumps for joy on reaching his hundred in what turned out to be a match - winning innings it ’s hard to think of another set of fans that turn out in such support for their side and with such vociferously worldwide as the @entity47 supporters do			1
at times the noise from the immensely vocal crowd will tell you all you need to know about what is going on in the middle			0
and , while that support no doubt buoys the @entity47 players , it equally places them under an incredible amount of pressure			0
the type of pressure that has seen @entity58 and @entity60 ’s places in the side constantly questioned because of the limited time they spent in the middle during the tournament			0
the mere fact that they have batted so little because the rest of @entity3 ’s batsmen have performed so well is left by the way side			2
but if any of the players are feeling the weight of burden upon them then they are refusing to let it affect their game			0
in fact the players have risen to the task			0
@entity0 is congratulated for his milestone by @entity3 captain @entity13 on thursday @entity0 finally fell in the 47th over when he was bowled by @entity82 quick @entity81 @entity0 's innings of 137 from 126 balls came to an end after @entity81 endured some punishment @entity3 's @entity87 goes aerial for a six in his innings of 65 , @entity3 's second highest score @entity87 celebrates reaching his half - century as @entity3 's batsman struggled to score quickly arguably @entity0 came into this match as one the few top - order @entity47 batsmen who had yet to really impress , having made just 159 runs in his previous six innings			1
when required though , the 27 - year - old rose to the challenge producing some of the best shots of the entire tournament			0
the @entity47 innings began uncharacteristically slowly as @entity5 ’s attack produced a master class in tight bowling			2
@entity106 , having prodded and probed his way to a modest 30 of 50 balls , was stumped off the bowling of @entity108 after being beaten by the flight of the ball and failing to drag his foot back in time			0
@entity114 ’s ultimate destroyer @entity112 erupted in jubilation eight balls later as he had star batsman @entity117 caught behind for just three			2
the dismissal was all the more impressive , with @entity119 taking a low catch , as the wicketkeeper was stood so far back a car could have fit between him and the stumps			0
@entity5 wicketkeeper @entity119 whips off the bails to dismiss @entity3 opener @entity106 @entity106 was given out for 30 from the bowling of @entity108 as @entity3 's opening partnership ended on 75 @entity81 ( left ) and @entity128 chest bump in celebration after the wicket of @entity131 @entity81 was the pick of @entity5 's bowlers with three wickets for 69 runs off his 10 overs @entity81 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) fall to the ground laughing as @entity131 walks back to the pavilion and when @entity131 mistimed a loft over extra-cover from a fuller @entity81 delivery to depart for painful 19 off 37 balls , @entity3 looked to be struggling			1
if discipline defined the first 30 overs for @entity5 , having bowled an impressive 107 of those 180 as dot balls , then meltdown almost perfectly defined the last 17			1
@entity128 took the ball in the first over of the batting powerplay and after @entity87 sent the ball between two fielders , the @entity82 captain stood and berated his players			2
however , the game - changing over followed four overs later as @entity112 believed he had @entity0 caught at deep midwicket for 90 , only for the delivery to be called a waist - high no ball			2
confusion ensued , with the @entity82 players calling for a third - umpire second opinion but @entity161 remained unmoved and @entity0 remained at the crease			0
after reaching his ton off 108 balls the right - handed batsman let loose , lofting a beautiful inside - out drive for six			0
@entity81 eventually had his man , bowling an excellent yorker – a delivery so rare now but still a marvel when produced perfectly – as @entity0 departed to a standing ovation from the 51,000 strong crowd			0
@entity5 's @entity112 gives key wicket @entity117 an impassioned send off as he 's dismissed @entity112 followed a series of short balls with a full and wide delivery that caught @entity117 's outside edge @entity178 got @entity5 off to a steady start with a run a ball 25 before falling to @entity27 @entity27 celebrates his breakthrough as he finds @entity178 's edge and @entity13 takes the catch to make it 33 - 1 it seemed surprising then that the 19 - year - old bowler was another who found himself on the end of a verbal rollicking from his captain as @entity3 passed the 300 run mark for the third time in the tournament			1
at the beginning of the year 302 - 6 would probably have been seen as an achievable target against an @entity47 bowling attack that looked anything but international players			0
but with @entity13 ’s pack of bowlers having claimed 60 wickets in six matches @entity5 needed @entity178 to fire from the beginning			1
having found the boundary rope four times , @entity178 departed for a run - a - ball 25 as @entity13 took a low catch off @entity27 ’s bowling			0
without a run being added to their total , a mix - up in the middle saw @entity215 run - out for five and @entity5 two down for 33			2
@entity5 did their to best to keep up with the rate but the constant loss of wickets hindered their chances of making the match a contest			0
without adding a @entity223 ( left ) and @entity215 found themselves at the same end of the pitch despite a desperate dive , @entity215 is run out as @entity27 whips off the bails after a throw from @entity60 @entity3 opening bowler @entity230 ( right ) celebrates taking the wicket of @entity233 's @entity232 @entity234 claimed the @entity235 no 3 caught behind as @entity232 attempted to hold his side 's innings together @entity27 celebrates the wicket of @entity119 as @entity3 take total control of the quarter - final @entity3 fans were out in force in @entity32 for the day - night quarter - final on thursday the national flag of @entity3 is impossible to miss at the famous ground as @entity87 celebrates his 50 police speak to a fan wearing an @entity3 shirt and sitting behind a group of @entity5 supporters @entity232 ( 29 ) , @entity119 ( 27 ) , @entity252 ( 30 ) and @entity253 ( 35 ) all made starts but @entity5 failed to ever really trouble the @entity47 bowlers who bowled out their opposition for a seventh consecutive match			1
while @entity0 walked away with the man - of - the - match award , having become the fourth @entity47 batsman to hit a century during this @entity2 , the @entity47 bowlers contribution to the side remains invaluable			1
ridiculed ahead of the start of the tournament and spoken of as @entity3 ’s weak link , @entity27 , @entity265 and @entity266 continue to carry their side to outstanding victories			2
@entity3 look intent on holding on to the @entity2 and at the moment it would take a very brave individual to bet against them			1
the winner of friday ’s match between @entity11 and @entity275 await in the semi-finals .			1
