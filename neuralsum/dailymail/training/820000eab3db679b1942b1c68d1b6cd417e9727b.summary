@entity0 will arrive in @entity1 next week as a winner after heaping more misery on @entity6 ’s wretched @entity5 campaign			1
@entity7 is set to be unveiled at @entity8 on thursday with his reputation enhanced from a rewarding month in @entity10 that saw @entity12 qualify from the @entity13 and last night complete an impressive third - place finish			2
for @entity6 , while they were n’t thrashed quite as badly as they had been against @entity19 in tuesday night ’s historic semi-final , a second successive heavy defeat on home soil was a devastating end to a campaign which promised so much			2
booked : @entity40 , @entity48 manager : @entity52 5 @entity12 : @entity53 7 ( @entity54 90 ) ; @entity55 7 , @entity56 7 , @entity57 6 ; @entity58 6 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 6 ( @entity61 90 ) , @entity62 6 , @entity63 7 ( @entity64 70 7 ) ; @entity65 6 , @entity66 8			1
booked : @entity66 , @entity62			2
goals : @entity68 3 , @entity69 17 , @entity59 90 manager : @entity0 7 ref : @entity71 ( @entity72 ) 7 att : 68,034 manager @entity52 , a @entity5 winner in 2002 , surely wo n’t be able to survive this			2
he ’s been accused by 200 million people of picking the wrong players and choosing the wrong tactics			0
on last night ’s evidence in @entity79 , they are n’t all be wrong			0
@entity12 carried on where @entity19 left off with two goals in the opening 17 minutes – both the result of blunders from @entity37 centre - backs @entity40 and @entity39			1
the @entity10 huffed and puffed after that without ever suggesting they had the quality to launch a fightback and @entity59 completed the humiliation in injury - time			1
@entity52 made six changes from the team humiliated by @entity19 for a third - place play - off which for once carried some meaning			0
@entity7 stuck with his big guns @entity66 and @entity96 though @entity97 did n’t last beyond the warm - up after tweaking a hamstring and had to be replaced by @entity100 of @entity101			1
@entity102 : @entity6 goalkeeper @entity36 fails to save penalty from @entity96 in third minute @entity105 : @entity96 celebrates with team - mate @entity58 ( up ) after scoring the opening goal any hope among supporters in @entity6 ’s capital city that their team could restore national pride after the infamous 7 - 1 beating by @entity19 lasted less than three minutes			1
@entity40 , who missed the semi-final debacle through suspension , was n’t strong enough to stop @entity65 from turning midway in the @entity37 half and releasing @entity66			1
as the @entity116 forward sped towards the penalty area , @entity40 gave a despairing tug at the back of his shirt			1
the connection probably happened just outside the penalty area but @entity66 fell inside , and referee @entity123 awarded a penalty that @entity65 converted high and hard			2
clinical : @entity12 defender @entity69 lashes the ball into the net for second goal against @entity6 the only consolation for @entity6 was that @entity40 escaped with just a yellow card when he ’d clearly denied @entity66 a goalscoring opportunity			1
by 17 minutes , @entity6 had conceded again leading to fears of another humiliating drubbing			2
@entity39 was again the fall - guy , heading a clearance straight to @entity69 who had time to take two touches to control the ball with his left foot and then dispatch a finish with his right into the roof of the net past @entity36			2
all together now : @entity69 ( second left ) celebrates scoring @entity12 's second goal against @entity6 @entity6 looked shellshocked but while @entity19 were hungry for more goals on tuesday night , the @entity145 were happy to sit back until they got opportunities to hit the hosts on the counter-attack			1
@entity48 started to see more of the ball and was unlucky that his whipped - in free - kick did n’t get a decisive touch off @entity154 team - mate @entity49 or @entity50			0
one solo run and shot by @entity48 was saved by @entity53 – @entity6 ’s only effort on target in the entire first half			0
blow : @entity12 defender @entity69 was injured in challenge on @entity6 's @entity48 ( left ) even in low gear , @entity12 seemed more likely to score			1
@entity34 had a low shot saved by @entity36 and when the @entity145 broke , they met little resistance from a woeful @entity37 midfield			0
@entity52 , whose job looks certain end sooner rather than later , made a change at the interval with @entity170 ’s @entity43 replacing @entity42			0
@entity42 ’s only contribution of the opening 45 minutes had been to leave @entity58 with a nasty gash on the back of his head with a wayward arm			0
agony : injured defender @entity69 is carried off on a stretcher but it did n’t improve much for @entity6 after half - time			1
the harder poor @entity39 tried , the worse it got for him as he gave the ball away with regularity			2
the scorer of an incredible free - kick against @entity186 could n’t beat @entity53 with a relatively tame effort when given a shooting chance from 25 yards			0
@entity189 must be thinking he ’s a genius for selling the shaggy - haired defender for £ 40million before the @entity5			0
clincher : @entity12 midfielder @entity59 seals victory with injury - time strike his former @entity154 team - mate @entity48 did n’t fare much better			1
he was booked for diving when he ran into @entity69 and then somersaulted in the air looking for a penalty			0
poor blind had to be carried off with a hurt knee as a result of the coming - together and @entity202 replaced him for the last 20 minutes			0
by the time @entity52 introduced @entity45 for the latter stages , you knew he and the entire nation were desperate			0
it was no surprise when the muscular forward got himself into a good shooting position and then took a wild swipe at the ball to send it wide			0
down and out : @entity59 scored the 10th goal against @entity6 in two games - a new low @entity7 was angry that @entity66 – who admitted diving earlier in the tournament – had two decent penalty appeals turned down			1
but ultimately , it did n’t matter			0
in fact , @entity202 crossed for @entity218 to make it 3 - 0 and @entity0 was able to send on third - choice goalkeeper @entity54 to ensure all 23 of his players in @entity6 had tasted some action - a nice touch			0
the contrast between the relaxed way @entity12 ’s players found space and knocked the ball around compared to the hypertension in @entity6 ’s game was evident			1
if @entity0 can replicate it at @entity8 , the fallen champions will be more than happy			0
nightmare : injured @entity232 could n't bear to watch as @entity6 went down to @entity12			1

@entity96 put @entity12 ahead from the penalty spot
@entity40 gave away penalty with tug on @entity66
@entity6 defender @entity39 at fault again for @entity12 's second goal
@entity59 sealed victory with third goal in injury time
