by @entity0 @entity1 met the @entity2 while out playing in @entity3 , behind the @entity6 ' @entity5 home aged four one of the highlights of the @entity9 exhibition which opens at @entity10 today is the @entity2 's unfinished novel , written when she was just eight			1
as we revealed exclusively in weekend last week , it was called the @entity15 and dedicated ' to @entity1 , my dear little friend and lover of horses			1
' and now we can reveal who @entity1 was - the girl who became ' my dear little friend ' to the most famous woman in the world			1
it all began in 1930 when , aged just four , princess @entity24 bumped into @entity26 while out playing in @entity3 , behind the @entity6 ' @entity5 home , 145 @entity28 , a stone 's throw from @entity31			2
the meeting was significant because , as @entity24 's governess @entity33 recorded , ' @entity1 was the one friend whom the @entity2 chose for herself			1
' the princess was the eldest child of @entity37 's second son , @entity38 , @entity39 , and his wife the former @entity40			2
her existing circle of friends consisted of cousins - near and distant from both sides of the family - and the selected offspring of aristocrats and courtiers			2
while @entity1 was n't from the highest echelons of society , she was certainly from a comfortable background			1
not only was she a neighbour of the @entity6 but her father , dr @entity53 , was also one of the country 's leading authorities on the diagnostic use of x-rays			2
in november 1928 , @entity37 , @entity24 's beloved ' @entity58 ' , fell dangerously ill with a streptococcal infection of the chest			2
@entity53 was called in to corroborate the diagnosis			2
he brought his cumbersome equipment to @entity10 on a lorry , fed the cables through a window and took his x-ray plates in as the king lay in bed			2
it was the first time x-rays had been taken of a patient outside a main hospital , and after his recovery the grateful monarch made the specialist a commander of the @entity76 , which was later upgraded to a knighthood by @entity24 's father			2
two years later little @entity24 asked the doctor 's daughter , ' will you come and play with me ? ' speaking in her 80s , @entity1 recalled , ' we played @entity86 cricket			1
she was wearing a pink and white check dress and i was wearing a blue coat , ' although she conceded that seven decades later ' we always argue over what we were wearing '			0
' they would go on to see each other nearly every day after that , apart from family holidays , until @entity24 moved to @entity10 seven years later			2
looking back , @entity1 recalled the princess as ' a thoughtful and sensitive child , and naturally well - behaved			1
she never seemed aware of her position and paid no attention to the people who stood by the railings to watch her play			0
' ' the @entity39 relished a game of @entity112 ' the girls were usually accompanied by their nannies , and occasionally left the seclusion of their private garden to play in the other @entity5 parks			0
a charming press photo of the time shows the girls walking hand in hand through @entity31 , with @entity1 a good five or six inches taller than the princess despite being only eight months her senior			1
the two learned to skip , played hopscotch , and took dancing lessons together			0
' i suppose i was the bossy one , ' @entity1 admitted in 2006			1
' i think it was usually me who decided what games we should play			0
' sometimes @entity24 's father joined in , particularly relishing the hide - and - seek game of @entity112			0
' i remember my starchy nanny saying she found it very undignified having to hide in a bush with him			0
' at first @entity1 had no idea her friend was a princess , although it was soon made clear			1
' i had to curtsey to the @entity39 and @entity138 and to @entity139 , ' though she was allowed to call @entity24 by her pet name of @entity141			0
the @entity2 's handwritten novel that she dedicated to @entity1 this changed in 1936 when , with the abdication of @entity146 , @entity24 's parents became king and queen and @entity1 's ten - year - old friend became @entity150			1
' and so things became more formal , ' @entity1 remembered			1
' we called her @entity153 and curtsied to her			0
she grew up a lot and became , well , more serious			0
' the @entity155 moved out of their home at 145 @entity28 and into first floor apartments at @entity10			0
@entity24 's 30 toy horses went with her , apart from a favourite one called @entity160 , which she was concerned ' would not like being packed away in a removal van and put in storage			0
so she asked me to look after him , ' recalled @entity1			1
a couple of weeks later @entity24 wrote and asked @entity1 to come round to the palace and to bring @entity160 with her			1
during the war @entity24 was sent firstly to @entity168 and then to @entity169 and the two girls did n't see each other for the duration			0
in october 1940 , at the height of @entity174 , 145 @entity28 - which was unoccupied at the time - suffered a direct hit , destroying most of the house 's back and interior			0
the elegant façade remained intact until the 1960s when it was pulled down to make way for a road - widening project around @entity184 and the construction of the @entity186 between 1968 and 1975			0
today the hotel 's @entity187 occupies the former site of @entity190 and honours its former occupants by offering traditional afternoon teas ' for an experience fit for royalty '			0
the friends were reunited when @entity24 took her fiancé , lt @entity195 , with her to @entity1 's 21st birthday			1
' he was very good - looking and i could tell the @entity2 was very fond of him , ' @entity1 remembered			1
' i was there at their wedding in @entity202 and had a marvellous seat up near the front			0
it was all terribly impressive ; and the @entity2 looked so happy			1
' the two friends continued to meet from time to time at @entity1 's house for tea or dinner parties even after @entity24 became @entity2 in 1952			1
firm friends : the girls riding their tricycles in the park in 1933 accompanied by their nannies ' she used to say how nice it was to get out of @entity10 , ' and ' once she had arrived here , she was completely at ease			2
' in october 1953 @entity1 married @entity218 , who had proposed to her outside the palace on @entity220			1
with the newly crowned @entity24 's permission , the ceremony took place at the @entity224 , @entity225 , and the @entity226 officiated			0
@entity218 was a director of the prestigious @entity5 wine firm , @entity227 & @entity228 , based at 3 @entity229 , which has supplied the @entity230 since the reign of @entity232 @entity233 and @entity1 had two children , a daughter @entity235 and a son @entity236			1
the latter is now chairman of the family firm and in 2007 , to the delight of his parents , became clerk of the @entity243 , responsible for drawing up the royal wine list and selecting wines and spirits for the @entity2 's cellar at @entity10 and other official residences			1
the @entity249 retired to a spacious apartment in a @entity252 crescent in @entity253 , where signed photos of the young @entity24 were a reminder of her special royal friendship			0
' she used to say how nice it was to get out of @entity10 , once she had arrived at my house , she was completely at ease ' @entity1 was occasionally invited to royal parties and in march 2004 was at the @entity262 when the @entity2 hosted a gathering for friends and family			1
the two also exchanged letters and cards and in 2006 @entity1 sent the @entity2 an 80th birthday greeting and a silk scarf as a present			1
in a rare public comment that year she paid tribute to her friend and monarch			0
' she has taken the job tremendously seriously and made a great success of it			2
the @entity2 was determined that she would work hard ; not just enjoy the privileges			1
' she has wonderful dedication			0
she is absolutely steadfast and sets an example to other people			0
perhaps at one point she was a little too remote - out of shyness - but that has changed too			0
i feel terribly privileged to have been her friend for so long			0
' @entity93 died peacefully at home on 16 march , 2012 , at the age of 86 , two years after the death of her husband			2
they left their two children , five grandchildren and one great - grandchild			2
she also left many memories for the @entity2 of a special relationship that began on a summer 's day over eight decades earlier when a four - year - old princess , isolated in that rarefied world of pre-war royalty , just needed someone to play with			1
@entity9 is part of a visit to the @entity304 of the @entity305 at @entity10 , 26 july - 28 september , 2014			0
the accompanying book , @entity9 : a @entity307 , is published by the @entity308 , £ 9.95 ( £ 12.95 in bookshops ) .			0
