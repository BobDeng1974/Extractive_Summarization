a heartbroken groom - to - be jilted by his fiancée over @entity2 is selling the chance for a new woman to join him on his honeymoon next month - and already has a bid of £ 690			1
@entity7 , 32 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , is auctioning the spare ticket on his £ 1,950 dream break to the @entity12 with offers starting at 99p			1
mr @entity7 says he is looking for a woman of any age with ' a good sense of humour ' to join him on the two - week break at an all - inclusive four star resort in the @entity20			1
he leaves for the @entity12 two days after @entity21 and returns on march 3 and hopes he 'll have a ' new friend ' with him			2
his ex-fiancée @entity24 said today she ' did n't feel ready to get married ' , adding : ' fair play to @entity7			1
i ’m pleased that he ’s doing something positive '			1
but he has warned any new companion they would be sharing a room and said : ' i 've got no criminal record but should be locked up for my snoring '			0
explaining his decision to sell - off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste			1
' besides , i think it will be good for me to get away			0
i 'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun			1
' he claims his girlfriend of two years , @entity24 , told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on @entity21 this year			1
two days later they were due to head off on their honeymoon			0
reaction : mr @entity7 said he was sad about his break - up but was n't willing to ' mope ' and wanted to enjoy his holiday prize : the winning bidder , as long as it is a woman , will get to spend two weeks with @entity7 here at the @entity76 in the @entity12 but when he tried to cancel their holiday the co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him			1
with the help of his best friend @entity83 , he set up an @entity85 auction to find someone to travel with him and the top bid now stands at £ 51			1
@entity7 describes himself as a slim , 5 ' 9 , with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh			2
his advert reads : ' i 'm not boring , i 'm adventurous otherwise i would n't be doing something as ridiculous as this '			2
although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry in just five weeks ' time on @entity21 , @entity7 says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee			1
plea : the jilted boyfriend said there is nothing ' sinister ' about his plan and is looking for a ' new friend ' to join him on his rip of a lifetime he said : ' i 'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - i suppose i 've got to respect her honesty			2
' but i 'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by			0
' when i found out at the travel agent i could only get half my money back i was looking at other deals and places i could go but i thought , ' no , i wanted to go on this holiday '			0
' i called my best friend and he agreed so i headed straight to his house to make the ebay page			0
' everyone i know is taken and i 'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that i 'd never otherwise get to meet			0
' i 'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before			2
' i 'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday			0
if the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too			0
' i really thought that i would only get about £ 100 on ebay - enough to pay the £ 50 name change fee and a bit of spending money			0
' i ca n't believe how well it was going			0
so if you 're up for a laugh and fancy a fantastic holiday - let me know ! ' after being overwhelmed with the response , @entity7 has pledged to donate any money over £ 1,050 to testicular cancer research			1
he added : ' people have said i 've got real balls to do this so i thought i might as well try and make some money for charity if i can to			0
' his ex-girlfriend @entity24 said today she ' did n't feel ready to get married			2
she said : ' i just did n’t feel ready to get married and @entity7 was n’t my soulmate			0
obviously it ’s difficult for @entity7 , i ’m finding it hard too			2
' it ’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over @entity2 but i thought it was better that he knew now , sooner rather than later			0
' it was better that i called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it			0
' fair play to @entity7			1
i ’m pleased that he ’s doing something positive			1
' the flight leaves @entity160 for @entity161 on monday , february 16 at 9.45 and arrives back at 05.35 on march 3 , 2015			0
