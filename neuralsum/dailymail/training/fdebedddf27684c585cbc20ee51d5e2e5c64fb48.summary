@entity0 completes @entity2 move on three - and - a - half year deal @entity7 sign @entity5 defender @entity4 on loan for the rest of the season @entity11 returns to @entity12 after @entity12 seal £ 6m permanent transfer @entity15 4 - 0 @entity7			1
a dark day in the history of one of @entity19 's great clubs , and a dark day for @entity20			2
many poked fun at @entity7 's plight after the @entity25 fixture , but since that game , @entity26 has got down to work in removing the outcasts from his squad			1
in fact , @entity11 and @entity32 's departures on transfer deadline day mean that half of the players who made the trip to stadium : @entity39 have since left the club			1
video : scroll down to see @entity42 's january transfer guide - @entity7 @entity7 players were humiliated at @entity44 earlier this season , beaten 4 - 0 in the @entity25 @entity20 has got rid of half the players who featured in the squad on that evening in august @entity11 's permanent move to @entity12 was confirmed on transfer deadline day @entity7 's squad against @entity44 ' i am not shocked because i know what can happen , ' @entity26 said after the defeat			1
' a new team is not built in one month			2
' five months on , and his revolution is in full swing			0
only @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 from the starting xi have survived the @entity65 manager 's axe			0
@entity68 started at centre back that day but is now at @entity70 , @entity67 plies his trade at @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 signed for @entity75 and @entity76 on loan respectively , @entity66 was a summer deadline day departure to @entity80 , while @entity81 has left the club and looks set to join @entity83			1
@entity32 is highly thought of at @entity84 and his loan move to @entity5 should be more a process of getting minutes , rather than giving up hope on the 19 - year - old @entity89 youth international			1
@entity90 , an unused substitute in @entity15 , has also been called upon by @entity91 on an emergency goalkeeping loan			0
but it is another case from the bench from that day that has drawn most attention ; @entity98 's permanent switch to @entity12 being confirmed			2
@entity98 's attitude was questioned at @entity84 and he managed just 28 @entity101 minutes at the club @entity103 and @entity73 ( now at @entity75 ) , look dejected during the crushing defeat @entity105 wished the best of luck to @entity81 , who is set to return to @entity108 with @entity83 @entity44 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity109 6.5 ; @entity110 6.5 , @entity111 7 , @entity112 7 , @entity113 6.5 ; @entity114 7.5 , @entity115 7.5 ; @entity116 6.5 ( @entity117 61 min , 6.5 ) , @entity118 8 , @entity119 7 ( @entity61 56 , 6 ) ; @entity120 7.5 ( @entity121 68 , 7 )			1

att : 26,969 * ratings by @entity143 at stadiummk ' @entity98 's application and attitude – at least among last season 's management set - up at @entity7 – was never considered to be right , ' @entity42 's @entity144 says			0
the winger , who has impressed in south @entity150 where he was brought up this season , managed just 28 @entity101 minutes with @entity7 under @entity152 - 22 against @entity153 and six against @entity154			0
since then , @entity26 has usually stuck to picking his best players available , albeit with introducing a few new faces alongside his seasoned pros			2
victories at @entity159 and a draw at @entity161 were accomplished with near full - strength xis , indicating @entity26 just does n't trust the majority of his squad			2
once you fail an audition like many did against @entity44 , you 're out the door			0
@entity7 finished deadline day with just one signing , the virtually unknown full back @entity4 on loan from @entity5 , but the summer is expected to be much busier for @entity173 and @entity26			1
by then his revolution may well be complete			0
@entity5 confirmed that @entity175 ( l ) has arrived on loan with @entity4 ( r ) heading to @entity7 @entity66 signed for @entity101 rivals @entity80 for £ 16m on deadline day in the summer			1

@entity7 sold three players on transfer deadline day
@entity11 joined @entity12 and @entity32 left for @entity5 on loan
@entity0 also left @entity84 to join @entity2
@entity20 said in august : ' a new team is n't built in one month '
