@entity138 , drawings and watercolours specialist at @entity142 's auctioneers , said : ' the @entity21 was the first magazine of its kind in the world			1
' it was at the forefront of the development of visual journalism			0
this collection is an unprecedented treasure trove of artworks from one of the 20th century 's most important publications by some of the best illustrators of the time			2
' it is particularly fitting that the core of the collection , world war illustrations , should come to light 100 years after the @entity127 's outbreak , and offer a first - hand account of that turbulent period in history at such a poignant time			1
' fields of slaughter : this illustration shows tourists returning to the battlefields of @entity31 in @entity172 after the @entity127 , where thousands of @entity173 and @entity175 soldiers died illustration : one of the most famous illustrations is of @entity178 , and functioned as a recruitment tool during the @entity127			0
it originally appeared as a cover illustration on the @entity183 magazine in the days before photographs could be easily taken , processed , distributed and printed , illustrations were often the quickest way to show people what was going on in the world			0
so popular were the drawings which accompanied current news events in the periodicals swirling around @entity88 and towns beyond at the time that an entire new genre of publication , which focusses on illustrations , was born			0
chief among them was @entity21 , founded in 1842 by @entity199 , who had noticed that other newspapers experienced a sales spike when they carried prominent illustrations , and decided to provide a dedicated outlet			1
even though just decades after its foundation photography became more widespread , it remained much faster to sketch a drawing and print it than to process a photograph			0
the most prominent practitioners could create a lavish illustration in a matter of hours and have it ready for the next day 's publication			0
it was challenged by the appearance of the @entity215 ( 1883 - 2014 ) , which competed on similar footing but never gained enough traction to really threaten its rival			2
meanwhile , outside of news coverage , illustrations became a very common way for publications to grab attention with a unique , strong image for their front cover			2
one of the most famous images from illustrated magazines was a portrait of @entity178 , who was secretary of state for war during the @entity127 , and whose face appeared on recruitment ads throughout the land			2
the original was in fact dashed off for an upcoming issue of the @entity183 magazine , by an artist - @entity236 - who had never spoken to nor seen the man himself			1
the power of the original image , much mimiced around the world by the likes of the @entity243 government with their @entity245 posters , and even by @entity175 fighters , eventually began to wane			0
however , as photographing technology became better it ceased to be an especial need to include illustrations and the job could be done quicker and more cheaply by using different methods			0
the circulation of @entity21 began to wane as photography became a staple feature of journalism			1
by the time of the magazine 's closure in 2003 the figure had plummeted from the hundreds of thousands to a much more modest figure			0
the magazine continued right up until 2003 , but at that time in only published every other months to a small audience .			0

the @entity21 published intricate artwork on its front covers for more than 160 years
included historic moments such as royal *ceremonies* and war - and boasted as many as 300,000 readers
now owners of original artworks to produce covers have decided to sell 70 off for around £ 1,000 each
