the 33 - year - old priest , who has not been named by officers , said he could not ' betray the confessional box ' but eventually added he had been asked to ' get rid ' of the gun			2
security guards called police after the .9 calibre handgun showed up during an x-ray check on the holy man 's luggage - nestled between a @entity21 and set of rosary beads			1
it was discovered as the priest , dressed in black robes and wearing a dog collar , boarded a ferry at @entity29 , north of @entity1 , which was bound for @entity30 on the island of @entity32			0
he was taken to a cell at @entity29 jail , where the @entity37 order priest insisted for several hours that @entity39 doctrine banned him from revealing details as the gun had been given to him during a confession			1
eventually he told police that it had been handed to him by a ' 70 year old parishoner ' who had asked him to get rid of it and he had planned to throw it into the sea mid voyage			1
police chief @entity50 said : ' for the time being the priest will have to stay in custody			0
he is being held on suspicion of illegal possession of a firearm			2
' the weapon was found in his luggage during a security check before he boarded a ferry heading to @entity32 - which left without him			1
' he has told us the briefest of details about how he got the gun during a confession and what he was supposed to do with it but he refuses to say anymore because he can not betray what he was told			1
weapon : @entity70 had .9 calibre handgun in his luggage ( library image ) ' all he has told us is that it was given to him by a 70 year old parishioner during confession who asked him to get rid of it			1
' when he was asked why he has n't called police the priest said he could not reveal details of what he had heard during the confession			2
' mr @entity50 said that ballistic checks would be carried out on the gun to see if it matched any recorded crime and when it was last fired			2
he added : ' we need to know the history of the gun and why the priest had it in his luggage			1
until we get some answers he will remain in custody			0
' @entity98 officials have been informed and the priest is due before a judge on monday for a preliminary hearing			0
under the @entity104 's @entity103 , ' it is a crime for a confessor in any way to betray a penitent by word or in any other manner or for any reason '			0
a priest , therefore , can not break that code to save his own life , to protect his good name , to refute a false accusation , to save the life of another , to aid the course of justice , or to avert a public calamity			0
he can not be compelled by law to disclose a person 's confession or be bound by any oath he takes and if he does he could be defrocked and excommunicated			0
earlier this year , a man from @entity127 was arrested by police after he ran into a @entity130 church and told a priest he had killed his girlfriend and the authorities were immediately alerted			0
a priest at the church later explained that if the man had decided to make a full confession in a booth then they could have done nothing but as he had simply rushed in and grabbed a priest it did not count			0
voyage : the gun was found as the priest boarded a ferry ( library image )			2
