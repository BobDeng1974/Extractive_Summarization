nothing draws a more scathing response from @entity2 than the suggestion that the established order in men ’s tennis may be breaking up , but the evidence continues to grow			2
this season has yielded four different @entity10 winners , two of them from left field , and the newest resurfaced on tuesday , bleary - eyed after three hours ’ sleep			1
@entity13 , who hammered a hesitant @entity14 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 on monday to win the @entity16 title , is one of several players putting a fresh complexion on the top 10 that , for the first time in six years , is missing @entity23 ’s name			1
@entity2 is right that the top three remain in situ , but with @entity44 ’s participation for the rest of the season uncertain due to his wrist injury , their lock on the game looks less secure			0
‘ i felt there was an opening this year , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ @entity44 did n’t play the last two months , @entity50 ( @entity50 ) was up and down after his success in @entity52 , @entity23 had a back operation and this season did n’t play as great as we have seen him in previous years — so it was an opportunity for other players			0
‘ the top guys are still going to be there			0
i do n’t know next year if we are going to see more new champions but for sure people like me , ( @entity62 ) @entity61 , ( @entity64 ) @entity63 , @entity14 and ( @entity65 ) @entity66 when he comes back			2
@entity67 : @entity68 , @entity69 's coach and long - time mentor , celebrates with his supporters delight : @entity13 celebrates winning the @entity16 title , who was a surprise champion in @entity26 out : @entity44 has been out injured since losing to @entity75 in the 4th round at @entity77 in july ' i feel our percentages are going to be much higher compared to the usual top four that we have been used to seeing			1
’ @entity23 now faces a real challenge to qualify for the eight - man field at the season - ending @entity84 at @entity86 ’s @entity85 in november			2
barring freak results , or @entity44 being absent , there are effectively only three spots still available as @entity13 and @entity50 ’s @entity10 titles will get them in			1
@entity23 ’s ranking is rather falsely depressed , however , as he did not play from mid-september onwards in 2013 , meaning that the only way should be up for him over the next couple of months			0
demolition : @entity13 completely thrashed legend @entity2 in straight sets in the semi-final of the @entity16 frustration : @entity23 has had an inconsistent season since returning from back surgery he is likely to play four events between now and @entity86 ( two in @entity102 and two in @entity104 ) and will probably need to perform strongly in three of them to make it			1
that is likely to happen if he can replicate the aggressive form he showed for two - and - a - half sets against @entity32 in the quarter - finals in @entity26			0
there are likely to be ranking points on offer as the top three ’s participation may be limited before november			0
aside from @entity44 ’s condition , @entity2 may ease off after a heavy schedule this year while @entity32 is likely to be preoccupied with the birth of his first child			0
nevertheless , the chasing pack are now emboldened as never before against the quartet who have so dominated the sport — in part due to the influx of @entity127 winners without much prior experience now working with them as coaches , such as @entity68 with @entity13			1
‘ before he was with 50 kilos over his back			0
i told him just go play and enjoy it , show the world what you can do , ’ said @entity68 , who won @entity77 in 2001			1
‘ ex-players are the best coaches , if they have the time			0
’ one clear thing has emerged from a less predictable than expected @entity10 season — there has never been a better time for former champions looking to get back into the game			2
surprise loss : @entity146 number one @entity32 fell at the semi-finals stage to @entity14 in @entity26			2

@entity13 beat @entity14 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 to win the @entity16 men 's singles
the @entity29 won a maiden @entity10 being coached by @entity68
the final between @entity13 and @entity14 was the first slam final without one of the ' big four ' present since 2005
