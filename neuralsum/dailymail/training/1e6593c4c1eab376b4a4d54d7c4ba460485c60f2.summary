by @entity0 published : 13:08 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 17 may 2013 embarrassment for the @entity3 's wig - wearing agent @entity2 deepened yesterday as it was revealed he was detained by the very @entity5 officer he was seeking to recruit			1
undercover diplomat @entity6 has been mercilessly mocked on the web both in @entity8 and the @entity9 for his apparently amateurish boy 's @entity11 approach to espionage in @entity14			1
but yesterday the @entity5 claimed that the @entity8 anti-terrorism expert he was hoping to lure to treachery wasted no time in personally apprehending him , pinning him to the ground , and handing him over to the authorities			1
' he will continue to serve			0
there is no threat to his career			0
' the @entity8 have not named the target of the @entity3 approach but he is believed to be a specialist in terrorism linked to extremist @entity59 groupings			0
@entity6 called him seeking a meeting at which he intended to recruit him , it is claimed			2
instead he ended up face on the ground , and handcuffed , before being taken to the notorious @entity64 of the secret services for questioning			2
@entity68 agents first came across the @entity8 agent when they were given assistance by @entity14 over the @entity71 , it is understood			1
@entity6 , 29 , a third secretary in the embassy 's political department , was detained wearing a blond wig under his baseball cap while on a mission to recruit the @entity5 operative on the night of may 13			0
in his possession , @entity6 had another wig , a compass , a map of @entity14 , sunglasses , and a ' @entity84 ' letter - apparently translated into @entity8 on @entity85 - which offered $ 1 million a year plus bonuses to the @entity5 man			1
@entity6 has been ordered to leave @entity8 in the next few days			2
statement : ' recently , the @entity23 intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of @entity8 law enforcement agencies and special services , ' according to the @entity5 stash : he was detained with ' special technical devices , written instructions for the person he was recruiting , a lot of cash , and things to help change one 's appearance , ' according to the @entity5 mission : the website of the @entity23 embassy in @entity8 informs that its political section is engaged in ' bringing to the attention of the @entity8 government the @entity23 position on the issues of foreign policy and security ' questions : a letter the agent carried suggested the @entity23 government was willing to pay up to $ 1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential @entity8 recruit , if the letter released by the @entity5 is genuine release : @entity6 was held overnight before being released to @entity23 officials and expelled from @entity8 the arrest of @entity6 is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the @entity23 and @entity8			1
famously , 10 @entity8 sleeper agents were arrested in june 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary americans while secretly plotting against the country			0
the best - known is @entity131 , above , who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the @entity23 in the @entity138 period , however , @entity23 - @entity136 espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985 , military officer @entity134 was shot dead by a @entity136 sentry while spying in @entity143			2
one of the war 's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an @entity23 spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot			0
the @entity5 stressed yesterday that the @entity23 and @entity8 ' will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the @entity6 case , focusing instead on the positive aspects of their relations '			1
but @entity8 intelligence services say they have trapped a @entity3 ‘ spy ’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior @entity8 agent			1
diplomat @entity6 was thrown down and handcuffed in a night - time sting by the @entity5 secret service – formerly the @entity162			2
he had a rudimentary espionage kit containing a compass , map of @entity14 , knives , a microphone , two wigs , three pairs of glasses , plastic bags containing thousands of euros and an @entity166 , which prevents passports with computer chips being read remotely , @entity8 intelligence sources said			1
the ‘ agent ’ , a third secretary in the political section of the @entity23 embassy , was quizzed in the @entity5 ’s feared @entity41 complex before being handed over to @entity23 officials			0
unusually , the @entity5 made its coup public at once			0
it released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue checked shirt , dirty - blond wig and baseball cap , along with images of him in detention			0
spy sources said @entity6 was caught after a lengthy covert operation			0
@entity23 ambassador @entity192 – who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to @entity8 ’s foreign ministry			1
@entity6 was caught in @entity195 , an area in south - east @entity14 , the @entity5 said			0
they implied that he wanted to contact a senior @entity5 agent who was snooping on @entity198 , the alleged @entity199 bomber			0
a letter in @entity8 which @entity6 carried suggests – if genuine – that the @entity3 hoped to reel in a big fish			1
addressed ‘ dear friend ’ , it states : ‘ we are ready to offer you $ 100,000 [ £ 65,000 ] and discuss your experience , expertise and co-operation , and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to answer certain questions			0
‘ for long - term co-operation we offer $ 1million [ £ 650,000 ] per year			1
’ the recruit is instructed to use an internet cafe to ‘ create a new @entity215 mailbox which you will use only for staying in touch with us ’			0
the incident is the biggest spy scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent @entity131 and nine other @entity8 in the @entity23 in 2010			1
the @entity5 stated : ‘ recently , the @entity23 intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees of @entity8 ’s law - enforcement bodies and special agencies			2
