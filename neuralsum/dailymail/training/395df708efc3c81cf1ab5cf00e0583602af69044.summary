by @entity0 these incredible pictures show a glider pilot bailing out after a terrifying mid-air collision at 4,500ft			1
@entity5 @entity4 described how he was tipped upside down after what felt like a ' car crash in the air ' and forced to quickly open his parachute before falling to the ground			1
the 70 - year - old farmer , who was taking part in a gliding competition in @entity14 , said it is the worst thing that has happened in his 19 years of flying and admitted he was lucky to get out			1
here they are pictured moments before the crash terrifying : the 70 - year - old glider pilot was forced to take drastic action after the wing of his glider fell off free fall : as he jumped from the aircraft , he began to fall to the ground , prompting him to quickly release his parachute ' it was very scary			1
it was like a car crash in the air			2
i was very lucky to get out			2
the other glider seemed to come out of nowhere , ' the father - of - two said			1
' i was 4500 foot up in the air , if you 're going to crash then height is your friend			2
' there was a very loud crash and my glider seemed to immediately tip upside down			1
it all happened very quickly			0
' mr @entity4 , who has two children and two grandchildren added : ' i instantly knew i was in serious trouble			1
in training they teach you there are three things you have to do			0
i pulled the handle to open the canopy and then i pulled the buckle to release me and because of the latitude i was at i just fell out			0
' ' once i was free of the aircraft i released the parachute			1
when i knew i was in trouble i just focused on getting on with it and my training kicked in			0
' i then had two or three minutes of drifting down and there was no wind so i literally fell straight down			0
' when i was falling time really slowed down			0
i 'd never jumped out a plane before or anything like that so it was a very different experience			0
' mr @entity4 described how he then crashed landed in a field , just 50 yards in front of a working combine harvester			1
concerned the farmer did n't notice him , he managed to get to the edge of the crop			0
he was concerned he had killed the pilot of the other glider , but he managed to carry on flying and landed safely			2
lucky : @entity4 , 70 , at his home in @entity80 , said the collision felt like a ' car crash in the air ' and admitted he was fortunate to have got out ' he did n't stop			1
i 'm not sure if he had n't seen me or if he thought i was just a professional parachuter			0
' it 's funny but it 's also frightening to think i could have landed safely then been hit by farm equipment			0
' ' a farm worker came and gave me water and a phone			0
my leg was bleeding but the pain in my back and neck was the worst			0
' mr @entity4 took up gliding when he was 50 years old after his wife gave him lessons as a birthday gift			1
he has since joined a gliding club , but admits this is the worst experience he has been through			0
' when you go for a parachute jump they 're big but gliders are so small that the parachutes have to be too - they are intended purely for survival			1
it 's equivalent to falling 12 ft off a roof			0
' paramedics came and put me on a board			0
they decided at 9pm i was well enough to get off the board but i was very wobbly and stayed the night			0
bailing out : the pilot , aged 50 , leapt from his cockpit following the collision and released his parachute escape : the pilot fell to the ground as the broken wing and aircraft plummeted to the ground ' i found out i had fractured a vertebrae , it 's a stable fracture so it wo n't require surgery			1
when i saw the photos i could n't believe it , my family could n't believe it either			0
it was frightening to see the pictures of me in the air			0
' mr @entity4 said his love of gliding came from being an ' adrenaline junky ' when he was younger			2
after ' flipping his car a few times , he learned how to remain cool in dangerous situations and ' not go stiff '			0
the 70 year old , who has been a farmer all of his life , said he is sad that the glider has gone , but does not think it is worth getting another			1
local resident @entity144 , who captured the horrifying moment from his garden , was shocked to see the wing break away from the glider and plummet to the ground			2
the electronics engineer , had been in his garden trying to get photos of birds when he saw the gliders about half a mile away			2
the 45 - year - old , said it was a shock to see the two gliders collide and one start to break up			1
he said : ' there were about half a dozen to eight gliders and i took some pictures of them			2
then two of them touched each other , one of the wings came off , and it went straight down			0
' mr @entity4 's glider crashed upside down in a field near @entity171 in @entity14			1
the broken wing landed nearby			2
the pilot of the second glider was able to land safely on an airfield near @entity176			2
the accident in now being investigated by the @entity178 ( @entity178 )			1
drifted : the pilot , safely suspended by the parachute , drifted slowly towards the ground as the broken wing sailed further away from the aircraft the pilots were taking part in the week - long @entity186 on saturday afternoon , which had 35 contestants , and each glider was believed to have been flying at around 50mph			1
they were flying from the @entity189 at @entity190 , near @entity191 in @entity192			0
@entity193 , chief executive of the @entity178 , said : ' this type of accident happens very rarely , it is a relatively safe sport but everybody does accept there is a greater risk than climbing on a commercial aircraft			1
' he said each glider would have been flying around 50mph and the force of the crash was enough to separate the wing from the glider			2
he added : ' the pilot jumped out effectively and the other pilot landed immediately			0
' wreckage : the damaged glider landed upside down in a field in @entity171 , @entity14			1
the broken wing fell to the ground and rested nearby scene : police were called to the crash site while the pilot was taken to hospital reflection : the father - of - two has said he is sad that the glider is gone , but does not think it is worth getting another one			1
