by @entity0 the monsters that haunt children 's nightmares have been bought vividly to life by an imaginative @entity6 photographer			1
the images show children battling giant , sharp - toothed creatures â€“ but with a twist			2
the terrifying monsters , with sharp claws and big eyes , seem to be afraid of the children as they cower in the corners of the youngsters ' bedrooms			1
armed with sticks , wands and swords the eight - and nine - year - olds gain the upper - hand against the villains			1
@entity25 fights a monster with a pop gun and a rifle in his bedroom as imagined by @entity30 in her @entity31 , a photographic project @entity33 photographer @entity30 , 22 , said : ' i wanted the children not to be victims and to fight the monsters			1
i wanted the monsters to fear the children			0
' @entity30 , who began the project in march , asked friends and family to pose for the shoot and used their own bedrooms to inject their personality into the photos			2
she then doctored images of real animals - such as rhinos and monkeys - to create the beasts			0
and she even drew from her own fear of spiders for one creepy creature			0
but the children showed no fear during the shoot			0
she added : ' i asked them to imagine a monster but because they 're children it was just a game for them			0
' have at you : this monster looks terrified as @entity64 looks like he is about run it through with a sword in his bedroom in @entity30 's @entity31 photographic project @entity70 : this monster is begging @entity71 to show it some mercy as it hovers fearfully in her bedroom @entity75 , bang , you shot me down : @entity78 takes aim in his bedroom at what looks like a dinosaur that has escaped from @entity82			0
meanwhile , his four cuddly toys at the foot of the bed seem totally unperturbed by the cold - blooded creature climbing the furniture above them ' the children showed no fear during the shoot ' : especially not sixtine as she fights an imaginary monster in her bedroom who 's afraid of the big bad wolf ? @entity96 is n't as she fights one in her bedroom using just a magic wand in @entity30 's @entity31 photographic project			1
