a branch of hacker group @entity0 has taken on the people they believe are involved in the cover up of a horrific rape case in @entity5 where two star football players are accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl			1
the alleged rape took place in @entity10 , @entity5 in august of last year , but because authorities did not immediately arrest the athletes involved , much of the policing has been done on the web			1
officially , two boys - @entity16 and @entity17 - have been arrested and charged with raping a fellow 16 - year - old , taking her to a number of parties when she was too drunk to resist , digitally penetrating her and possibly even urinating on her			2
scroll down to watch video extract taking action : the so - called ' hacktivist ' group @entity0 made a video announcing their plan to ' out ' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident the case , which was publicized nationally by an explosive @entity31 story , has split the small town of @entity10 into two sides - those who are devout fans of the football team who have chosen to support the two players , saying that the incident is the girl 's fault for getting that drunk			1
there is also the allegation that she was drugged , but because a toxicology report was not done immediately after the alleged assault , that has not been proven			2
others feel that the reason why the case has not moved more swiftly through the legislative process is because local officials are covering up for the start athletes , taking it as the latest example of the hero - worship provided the teenage football players			1
horrific : attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move @entity0 qualifies as the latter , and an individual cell called @entity64 has appointed themselves that internet vigilantes for the case			2
on their website , called local leaks : the @entity70 , they said that they took up the cause since ' a town rife with corruption , cronyism , illegal gambling and fixated upon their star high school football team ( a major economic revenue engine ) were prepared to orchestrate a major cover - up in order to sweep the entire affair under the rug			2
' the group ' began unraveling this conspiracy of silence designed to protect a group of these high school football players who had become well known to their fellow students as “ @entity89 ”			1
' they go on to name and discredit a number of people involved in the case - from the sheriff involved in the investigation to the prosecuting attorney - using their tech skills to hack into individuals email accounts and publish damaging allegations			0
in the case of a prominent football team supporter , the group published inappropriate and pornographic photos found in his email account			1
the @entity110 site has become somewhat of a collection of the various @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115 posts made by students who were either present at the parties where the girl was being dragged around by the two players by her ankles and wrists			1
that picture was originally screen - grabbed by @entity123 , a crime blogger who used to live in @entity10			1
she took it from the @entity114 account of a local high school student who later tried to sue her for defamation because she posted the photo on the web			2
his suit was dismissed and the teenage boy publicly apologized to the victim and her family , whose names are not being reported because she is a minor and an alleged sexual assault victim			2
a horrifying online trail of the august 11 incident continues to emerge , and one of the latest discoveries was that of a video of a group of high school students talking about - even laughing - about the alleged rape which seems to be happening at the time the video was shot			1
throughout the video , which is just over 12 minutes long , there are numerous references to a ' dead girl ' who is described as being raped and urinated on			1
the boy who talks the most in the video has been identified as @entity151 , a former @entity10 student and baseball player who can not contain his laughter as he describes the 16 - year - old victim , seemingly in another room of the house , being raped			1
' she is so raped right now , ' he says at one point in the video			2
laughing boy : the ' star ' of the video is @entity151 , a former @entity10 student who ca n't contain his laughter as he describes the ' dead ' victim , seemingly in another room of the house offensive : a number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online , including this one on @entity115 ; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence ' there wo n't be any foreplay for a dead girl , ' he says			1
' it ai n't wet now to be honest			0
trust me , i 'm a doctor			0
' the video was obtained by hacker group @entity178 and posted on @entity179 on wednesday			1
wearing an @entity181 t - shirt , @entity151 jokes that the girl is ' deader than a doornail ' and ' they p * * * * * on her			0
' he then goes on a tirade of the figures that she 's ' deader than , ' including @entity188 , ' @entity190 's wife , ' @entity191 and @entity192			0
fan frenzy : the @entity194 plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium , where they are broadcast on local television allegation : both of the boys facing charges are students at @entity194 and were on the school 's prestigious football team the city ’s police chief begged for witnesses to come forward , but received little response			0
at least two other people who do n't appear on camera interrupt @entity151 to let inform him that the situation is anything but a laughing matter			0
they raped her , ' one of them says			0
later , he chastises @entity151 , saying : ' like , this is not like funny ... what if that was your daughter ? ' @entity151 responds : ' but it is n't			0
if that was my daughter , i would n't care			0
i would just let her be dead			0
' and is it really rape if you do n’t know if she wanted to or not ? she might have wanted it			0
that might have been her final wish			0
' the names @entity237 and @entity17 , are also mentioned in the video - the names of the suspects in the case - @entity16 and @entity17 .			0
