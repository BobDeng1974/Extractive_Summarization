some would brand it decline , some would argue it 's just transition			2
it 's the process taking @entity6 from the middle of their first season under the late @entity10 ( august - december 2012 ) when their football showed absolutely no deterioration from the @entity14 era until january 4 , 2015 and a humiliating defeat to @entity17 ' @entity16			1
when you are in the middle of what was often a maelstrom , either as a player , coach , director , fan or writer , it can be hard to accurately chart the causes and cures			0
they are chronicled one after the other			0
@entity33 ( right ) is changing the identity of @entity6 but the transition has been a slow process @entity6 boss @entity33 talks @entity37 during the @entity39 defeat to @entity40 at the @entity41 but patterns ? reasons ? solutions ? it 's not simple to get right			1
one of the symptoms of @entity6 patently going through either decline or adaptation , even reinvention if you want , has been a loss of personality			2
for a long time @entity14 's teams were as spiky , belligerent , dynamic and confident away from home as they were at the @entity41			1
the front three of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 gives the @entity62 side a different dimension then , suddenly , they were n't			2
there was a hint of it in @entity14 's final weeks when his world and @entity69 champions lost away to @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 ( in a game they should have won at least 4 - 1 )			1
@entity79 football , often played without a safety net , long since a place where the top teams carry identical win expectations away from home , is where this loss of muscular mentality showed most			1
since @entity6 were last within a millimetre of the @entity79 final — on that mad evening of april 24 , 2012 ( 2 - 1 up on aggregate to 10 - man @entity72 and then 2 - 2 but with a penalty ) — until this week 's tie in @entity90 against @entity91 , they have suffered some painful and humiliating reverses on the road			1
@entity40 players celebrate the victory at the end of the @entity39 match which saw them shock the home side from then until now the @entity62 have lost away to @entity72 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , and have drawn at @entity101 ( twice ) and @entity105			0
despite the fact that @entity108 's @entity6 won 2 - 0 at the @entity109 at this stage last year , you could ally that really horrible drop in away form with the club 's historic record of playing in @entity115 ( lost 14 and drawn eight of 29 visits ) and suggest that the @entity118 champions need to be regarded as decent favourites on tuesday			1
however , @entity39 's second - placed side , who surprisingly went down 1 - 0 at home to @entity40 on saturday , have largely shed their chrysalis form and become butterflies			2
@entity125 ( centre ) has been an ever present since the @entity14 days but looks set to leave the club @entity128 ( left ) was linked with a move away but committed his future to the transtitional club despite the fact their worst humiliations this season have almost all come away from home — @entity137 , @entity40 , @entity16 in particular — @entity33 's side were thrilling in winning at @entity103 and @entity139 and it was then that confidence was sparking and @entity60 was beginning his process of reshaping how this team attacks			1
since losing in @entity144 in january , the @entity6 have scored 22 away goals while winning , with brutal authority , at @entity104 , @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity149			2
this week @entity59 concluded : ' from that day onwards we 've changed our approach totally			0
we are hungrier , we go out with a different attitude , we attack better , we press better			0
' @entity59 ( left ) believes @entity6 changed their style when they beaten by @entity17 ' @entity16 @entity33 , who does n't see football in quite the same manner as his superstar , disagreed			1
in fact he was n't pleased with the idea , insisting : ' all we are seeing is the normal process of a team 's evolution during a season			0
i continue to insist that we are doing the same things now as we were before			0
' but they are both right			0
the coach 's ideas have found their maturity — daily work , which is intense , disciplined , and aimed at making the team play with less midfield filigree , has made the team tough and confident			0
@entity60 is having something of a @entity177 impact			2
@entity60 is helping change @entity6 's identity and is forming a deadly partnership with @entity59 and @entity58 having taken a little time to adapt to not being the perpetual dominant striker reference point , and to adapt to their goal flows dropping ( which is also what happened when the @entity187 arrived in @entity6 in 2004 ) , their football intelligence has cascaded out			1
just as it 's easy , but short - sighted , to point out that the @entity190 is scoring less freely than at @entity191 , it 's easy — and one - dimensional — to add that his goal - assist flow is absolutely stellar			2
the superb ' extra ' is his movement , his awareness of fellow strikers @entity58 and @entity59 and the fabulous way in which he 'll either harass defenders into mistakes or make runs in such a way that space is created for the @entity205 and @entity206 to raise havoc			0
although @entity60 has n't been as prolific for his new side , he 's been the perfect foil for his striker partners given how dangerous , mobile and smart these three brilliant technicians are , given that the @entity215 era has now gone , it has made sense for @entity33 to retouch the @entity6 identity			1
@entity91 will face a team which , just as @entity108 tried to evolve them , is now happier to move up the pitch in shorter amounts of time using far fewer passes			0
instead of pulling teams this way and that , the boxing equivalent of wearing them down with dozens of jabs to the torso , they now unleash flurries of quick , ' knockout ' punches			0
according to what @entity234 told the elegant @entity237 writer @entity236 this week , that should make for a fine old spectacle			2
@entity91 's @entity240 commandante promised : ' last year our tactic was to try to ' contain ' @entity6 at our stadium , to shackle them , because the away goal is almost always a crucial factor in @entity79 knockout football			1
@entity91 no longer fear @entity6 and will take the game to them at the @entity41 this time ' but this year we 'll ' go for the game ' right from the outset — albeit with due respect to @entity6 's quality			1
' @entity234 also conceded that his process of establishing a @entity91 ' identity ' has faltered — in the opposite way to @entity6 's recent problems			1
' we 've ' lost ' our season at home , ' he admitted			0
' @entity258 put us out of the @entity259 , @entity260 out of the @entity261 and in the title race we 've lost the seven points which @entity72 has as an advantage to @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267			0
' the same in @entity69			0
we give away home advantage too often			0
' @entity79 music to @entity6 's ears			1
@entity91 face a team which , at last , loves life on the road			0
@entity274 will be the man @entity6 will need to watch when the two side meet in the @entity79			1

@entity14 's @entity6 has moved on as @entity33 continues to change the clubs identity - with the help of @entity60
@entity6 players are still butterflies but teams respect them , not fear them
@entity234 thinks the @entity79 clash will be a spectacle
