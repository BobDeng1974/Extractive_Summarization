an intruder high on bath salts was no match for a retired bull rider who was able to stop the man with a karate chop and a punch to the throat			1
' the guy went down cold , ' said @entity9 , the 79 - year - old who took down the intruder half his age			1
@entity11 , 38 , was arrested after @entity9 called the local @entity13 police and charged him with burglary of a habitation with intent to commit assault since he had a gun			1
' during the time i was actually patting him down and checking his pockets he asked if that was his dad 's eyeball in his pocket , ' one of the responding officers said			1
mr @entity9 awoke on monday morning to the rousing bark of his dog around 5.45am when @entity11 broke down the screen door and entered the kitchen			1
' i heard a ruckus at the door , walked to the door , and saw the young man holding a gun			0
i used to own a nightclub , and i knew it was never a good idea to talk to people holding guns , ' he told @entity47			0
scene : the intruder 's car broke down and he broke into this house with a gun even match : @entity11 , 38 , was bested by @entity9 , 79 not only that , but @entity11 was muttering incoherently , hinting at the trouble that a later drug test would later reveal			1
' i did n’t know whether to be scared or feel sorry for him , ' @entity9 told local station @entity57			2
' i just took that old hand and give him a good old chop , and normally , that really hurts bad , ' he said , describing his karate - style moves			0
to make sure @entity11 was out , mr @entity9 followed that with a punch to the throat , which ended the fight			1
back in the day : @entity9 earned second place in a large bull riding competition calmer days : now @entity9 spends his time farming in @entity67 playing dirty is nothing new to mr @entity9 who gained fame at an early age as a bull rider and cowboy who steadied himself on bucking broncos and bulls			1
beyond that , he also worked as a bouncer at a honky tonk that he owned so mr @entity9 is used to breaking up fights , though that was some time ago			2
' you can get run over real bad if you do n't protect yourself , ' he said			0
@entity11 did not suffer and permanent damage , and that comes as a surprise to some who know mr @entity9			2
' i figured he would hurt him worse , ' mr @entity9 's son @entity86 told @entity57			2
' he ’s not someone to mess with			0
