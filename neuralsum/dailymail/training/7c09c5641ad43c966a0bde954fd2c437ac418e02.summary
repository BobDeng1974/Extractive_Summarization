@entity1 was hit by a taxi five days after @entity13 switched off selected lights across the county in a bid to save £ 500,000 a year			1

@entity13 has even admitted that by doing this , safety will inevitably be compromised			0
mr @entity1 , who was in his first year at @entity27 , was killed on the @entity28 near @entity29 in the early hours of december 7 , 2012 , on his way home from a night out			1
the taxi driver said he was unable to see the 18 - year - old because the road was too dark , adding that it was the first time he noticed the street lights were switched off			1
coroner dr @entity37 recorded a narrative conclusion following the inquest at @entity40 on friday , but forced the county council into an early review of its street lighting policy on that stretch of road			1
a county - wide review was due next july , and a review of that stretch was taken following mr @entity1 ’s death , but dr @entity37 said : ‘ i do not believe the specifics of this case have been reviewed by those who have the power to do so sufficiently and i feel a delay until july is unacceptable			1
' i think a review will be helpful and i will be issuing a report to prevent future deaths			0
’ @entity62 , head of transport and highways at the county council , confirmed that lights on that stretch of road are left on later on friday and saturday nights following the death , but insisted the lights policy and the speed limit on the street were appropriate			0

experts : police said today that the taxi driver who hit @entity1 would have had less than two seconds to react because of the darkness taxi driver @entity92 , who cried in court , recalled how he did n’t see the student or know what he ’d hit after hearing a loud bang			1
mr @entity92 , who has driven a taxi in the area for 13 years , said : ‘ i was used to the road being lit , that was the first time i noticed they switched the lights off			2

they also found that in the poor lighting conditions , mr @entity92 would n’t have been able to react in time even if he had seen mr @entity1			2

' multiple factors taken together contributed to the collision including the lack of street lighting , @entity1 ’s dark clothing , his direction of travel and his position in the road			2
' on the balance of evidence it ’s not possible to isolate anything specific			0
’ after the inquest mr @entity1 ’s mother @entity146 , from @entity147 in @entity148 , said : ‘ we are very happy with the verdict and that the light situation will be looked at			2
it was certainly a contributing factor			0
