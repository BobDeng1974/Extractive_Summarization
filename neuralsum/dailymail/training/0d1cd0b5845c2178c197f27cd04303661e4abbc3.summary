this is a very good time for me			0
i want to see what they think now			0
' it was one of the best games i 've played			0
it 's an amazing moment for me			2
maybe a few days ago i thought this would n't be possible			0
' @entity0 scored the winner five minutes from time after @entity52 had cancelled out his earlier effort			2
roles reversed : @entity0 consoles @entity55 ( left ) but it was the other way round at @entity57 ( right ) an error from @entity55 allowed @entity0 in to score @entity12 's decisive second goal with six minutes to play			1
@entity0 said he told his @entity11 team - mate to keep his head up after the game			1

clash : @entity0 was suspended after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity13 in 2011 flashpoint : the @entity37 admitted to diving against @entity85 in 2012 in an attempt to win a penalty digging in : @entity0 was banned for the start of last season after biting @entity16 's @entity15 ' it 's a special day			1
