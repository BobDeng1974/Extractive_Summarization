dyslexia is a meaningless label sought out by middle - class parents who fear their children being branded stupid or lazy , an academic has claimed			1
professor @entity5 , an educational psychologist and former special needs teacher , said it is clear that some children do have genuine , complex reading problems			1
however , the definition of dyslexia is so broad that it is impossible to make any meaningful separation from other poor readers			1
and trying to do so is a ‘ pointless ’ waste of resources – because the same techniques help both groups of children improve their reading			0
rather than putting children though expensive and lengthy diagnostic tests , schools should focus on identifying early on those who struggle to read and treat all of those with problems equally			0
however , charities disputed his claims and said a diagnosis of dyslexia has scientific and educational value			1
the @entity40 estimates that 10 per cent of @entity41 have dyslexia , or word blindness , and have trouble learning to spell , read and write			2
the professor says the definition of dyslexia is so broad it does not allow for the separation between suffering from the condition and just being a poor reader while children diagnosed with the condition can get more individual teaching help and extra time on exams , professor @entity5 claims that their parents also benefit from the ‘ pseudo-medical ’ label			1
diagnoses tend to be found in more affluent areas and he argues that some middle - class parents seek it out because they fear their children will be judged slow or lazy			0
‘ most parents are delighted with the label , ’ said the professor			2
‘ professionals have said to me that they agree but they still use the term because they make people happy			2
’ he also argues that the definition of dyslexia is so broad that it is meaningless			1
‘ you have a long list of symptoms , things like anxiety when reading out loud , but any kid that is learning to read might be expected to show some anxiety , ’ says professor @entity5			2
‘ you show a parent this list and they say , “ you are right , i did n’t realise my kid was dyslexic			0
” ‘ it is like showing someone a horoscope , they look at it and see bits of themselves in it			0
’ professor @entity5 added that while parents may only want the best for their children , they are being ‘ woefully misled about the value of a dyslexia diagnosis ’			1
view the full video here what is dyslexia ? - @entity100 in 2009 , the @entity102 inquiry into literacy concluded that the definition of dyslexia was too broad to be meaningful			1
the influential committee of mps also accused the government of ‘ bowing to pressure from the dyslexia lobby ’ when formulating its educational policy			1
professor @entity5 said : ' diagnoses tend to be found in more affluent areas , it is quite clear that it is n't found a much in disadvantaged areas			0
most parents are delighted with the diagnosis ' but dr @entity115 , of the charity @entity116 , said that the term ‘ has value both scientifically and educationally ’			0
‘ we do n’t accept the argument that it is wasteful to try to understand the different reasons why different people struggle , ’ he said			0
‘ and for very many , those reasons fall into a consistent and recognisable pattern that it is helpful to call dyslexia			0
‘ helpful for individuals because it makes sense out of past struggles and helpful for teachers who can plan the way they teach , to overcome or find ways around the particular blocks that are there			0

@entity22 *'s* professor @entity21 says the definition is so broad it is impossible to separate sufferers from those who are poor readers
as a result , he said it is a ' useless term ' that should be abandoned
dyslexia charities say the title has both a scientific and educational value
