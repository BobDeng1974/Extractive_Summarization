after last weekend 's stalemate at @entity2 brought an end to @entity6 's six - match winning run , manager @entity0 admitted that his side remain some way short of a force capable of winning the @entity11 title			1
' when you want to be a part of the title race , you have to win these games , ' said @entity18 , cutting straight to the point , ' i saw @entity21 's first half against @entity22 , they struggled but 3 - 0 , that is the difference			0
' following @entity25 's 2 - 0 victory at @entity26 on monday evening , @entity6 fell 10 points behind @entity29 's team			1
given @entity29 's remarkable yuletide record - on the seven occasions his side have been on top at @entity32 , they have gone on to win the league title - it would take a considerable lapse of common sense to now back @entity18 to negotiate a ten - point swing and secure the league title in his first season in charge			2
@entity41 ( centre ) scored @entity6 's equaliser in saturday 's league draw at @entity2 @entity41 ( centre ) celebrates his goal with his @entity48 team - mates during their @entity11 encounter @entity6 boss @entity0 admitted after the match his side are a long way off from winning the title the @entity54 have lost three games so far this season - including an opening day defeat at home to @entity58 @entity59 ( right ) scored in @entity25 's 2 - 0 win at @entity26 - a win that moves them 10 points clear of @entity6 @entity64 ( centre right ) scored twice as @entity21 defeated @entity22 3 - 0 on saturday there is a need to tread carefully with such comparisons but , on the flipside , some may point out that @entity6 were only eight points off the pace at the same stage last season under @entity75			1
it should , however , be noted that @entity78 ' tally of 28 points from 17 games would have left @entity6 14 behind this season 's pacesetters @entity25			1
regardless , very would argue that @entity6 , as a football club , were in a healthier position this time last year			0
@entity90 , for all @entity18 's progressive work with this @entity6 squad , this @entity87 study reveals that only once before have the @entity54 found themselves so far adrift from first place on christmas day , with the @entity93 equalling the 10 point deficit that sir @entity94 slumped to in the 1995/96 season			1
it may not , however , be the most distressing omen			0
for that season transpired to be one of the most memorable and dramatic in the modern era , as @entity6 reversed @entity103 's advantage - @entity102 ' i would love it ... ' et @entity105 - and went on to be crowned champions			0
former @entity103 manager @entity102 ( right ) saw his side lose a 12 - point title lead to @entity6 in 1995 - 96 ex-united boss sir @entity94 ( right ) and assistant manager @entity108 hold aloft the 1995/96 league title united supporters may also take hope from the fact that eight of their thirteen title triumphs under sir @entity94 came despite failing to achieve first place at @entity32			2
in 1992/93 , for @entity94 's first title win , @entity6 were 5 points off the pace on christmas day , as they were in 1998/1999 when they went on to secure a @entity119			0
intriguingly , @entity18 's 32 points from 17 games eclipses the 31 points that @entity94 's most celebrated squad in 1999 had taken from their opening 18 games			0
in 2008/09 , a @entity6 squad featuring @entity127 and @entity128 were seven points behind @entity130 at @entity32 , although they did have two games in hand			0
@entity6 lost 3 - 2 to @entity133 in december 1998 - a result that saw them five points adrift in the table @entity6 's challenge this season , however , appears considerably more testing			1
@entity25 are made up of such mighty specimens , such powerful characters - @entity29 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 - that it is almost impossible to believe that doubt could corrode their resolve			0
even if they were to slip up , it is then equally difficult to imagine @entity21 also allowing their neighbours a run at the title			0
and even if these unlikely events were to transpire , does anybody really believe this @entity6 squad - beset by deficiencies in defence and injuries throughout - has the potential to amass the necessary points ? @entity145 ( left ) and @entity144 have been two of @entity25 's standout performers so far this season perhaps most ominous for @entity6 - despite their reputation for accelerating into gear in the second half of the campaign - is that they were rarely able to claw back @entity29 's @entity25			1
in both the 2004/2005 and the 2005/2006 season , @entity94 's @entity6 were nine points behind @entity25 on christmas day			2
the first time around , @entity6 ended up 18 points off @entity25 by the end of the season while in the 2005/06 season , @entity6 could only cut the deficit to eight points come the final day of the campaign			2
it should , of course , be said that @entity18 's principal target for this first season has always been @entity182 qualification but the results of recent weeks might just have had some @entity6 supporters wondering			0
last week at @entity2 provided a dose of reality and all logic now points to a second consecutive season without the @entity11 title at @entity48			1
@entity190 ( centre ) scored as @entity6 beat @entity22 5 - 2 at home in december 2004 - the result meant the @entity54 went into christmas nine points @entity25 , who eventually went on to win the title 2014/15 - 10pts behind in 3rd place with 32 pts from 17 games > end of season position ? 2013/14 - 8pts behind > 8th > 28pts ( 17 games ) > 7th 2012/13 - 4pts ahead > 1st > 43pts ( 18 games ) > 1st 2011/12 - 2pts behind > 2nd > 42pts ( 17 games ) > 2nd 2010/11 - 2pts ahead > 1st > 34 pts ( from 16 games ) > 1st 2009/10 - 4pts behind > 2nd > 37pts ( from 18 games ) > 2nd 2008/09 - 7pts behind > 4th > 32pts ( from 16 games ) > 1st 2007/08 - 1pt behind > 2nd > 42pts ( from 18 games ) > 1st 2006/07 - 2pts ahead > 1st > 47pts ( from 19 games ) > 1st 2005/06 - 9pts behind > 2nd > 37 pts ( from 17 games ) > 2nd 2004/05 - 9pts behind > 4th > 34 pts > ( from 18 games ) > 3rd 2003/04 - 1pt ahead > 1st > 40 pts ( from 17 games ) > 3rd 2002/03 - 4pts behind > 3rd > 35 pts ( from 19 games ) > 1st 2001/02 - 6pts behind > 5th > 30pts ( from 18 games ) > 3rd 2000/01 - 8pts ahead > 1st > 43pts ( from 19 games ) > 1st 1999/00 - 2pts behind > 2nd > 39pts ( from 17 games ) > 1st 1998/99 - 5pts behind > 3rd > 31pts ( from 18 games ) > 1st 1997/98 - 4pts ahead > 1st > 43pts ( from 19 games ) > 2nd 1996/97 - 7pts behind > 5th > 31pts ( from 18 games ) > 1st 1995/96 - 10pts behind > 2nd > 35pts ( from 19 games ) > 1st 1994/95 - 2pts behind > 2nd > 41pts ( from 19 games ) > 2nd 1993/94 - 12pts ahead > 1st > 52pts ( from 21 games ) > 1st 1992/93 - 5pts behind > 4th > 34pts ( from 20 games ) > 1st			1
