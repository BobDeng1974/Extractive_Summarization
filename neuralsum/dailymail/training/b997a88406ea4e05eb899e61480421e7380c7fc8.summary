by @entity0 a rare set of original prints has cast light on soldiers ' everyday life in the @entity6 100 years after fighting began			1
the 70 images , taken by press and army photographers on the @entity11 , were used as positive propaganda back home - but rarely for war material of the time , most were not posed or staged			1
instead they showed the everyday activities of soldiers in the harsh conditions of the trenches , including servicemen attaching a message to a collie dog which would have been used to deliver messages through @entity25			1
poignant : a rare set of original prints has cast light on soldiers ' everyday life in the @entity6 100 years after fighting began			1
in one , soldiers attach a message to a collie dog which would then be sent through @entity25			1
they would not have been spared by @entity34 snipers , but were small and quick enough to avoid them the first mechanised war : the photos depict everyday scenes near the @entity11 , including hundreds of 2ft artillery shells lined up neatly ready for battle bleak : the photographs were used as propaganda to encourage more men to enlist in the army back in @entity44 , but unlike many , they were not staged or posed @entity45 : another one of the photographs showed mules being used to pull horses out of a bog after they became stuck			1
conditions in winter were harsh dogs were used not because the enemy would spare them - they would have been shot dead like everyone else - but because they were small and quick enough to avoid snipers ' bullets			2
among them are images of troops braving the freezing winter months in their fortified trenches at stations in @entity64 and @entity65 soon after war broke out in summer 1914			0
one shot shows a ‘ shell dump ’ , where 2ft tall artillery shells were stored in their hundreds , while another shows soldiers manning rudimentary machine gun posts			1
in another , a @entity73 loads a rocket onto a wooden launching pole which would then be fired to announce to impending attacks			0
some were not so positive : a particularly grim shot shows mules pulling horses from a muddy bog in which they had become stuck			1
convenient : @entity44 foot soldiers pass through a hole in a wall , which handily has been blasted out for them by a previous shell			2
few cameras were on the front line no peace on the horizon : soldiers using range - finding techniques			2
the 70 photographs are original prints which would have been made from glass negatives everyday work of war : soldiers reinforcing a trench ( left ) and hanging telegraph wires from a tree branch ( right )			1
communication was everything in the high - tech war remains : the wreckage of a @entity34 field gun			2
what the images do not capture is the unprecedented violence of the world 's first fully mechanised war just like home : key trenches were wide enough to take horses and carts , and soldiers would add the names of @entity120 streets to make them more familiar some of the images carry a ‘ press ’ stamp on the back , and experts - who expect the collection to sell for £ 3,000 at an auction next week - say the rest were likely to have been taken by official army photographers			1
although they were seen at the time , as part of a recruitment drive to show troops ' enjoying ' life in the trenches , many have not been seen in years since and some may never have been seen publicly at all			0
the prints were made from original glass negatives and are being sold in six lots by auctioneers @entity140 next wednesday in @entity141 , @entity142			1
for 40 years they were owned by an anonymous memorabilia collector from @entity142 who has amassed one of the country 's finest collections of photographs , documents and medals from the @entity6			1
now in his mid- 60s , the man - who is not a veteran - acquired the photographs in a single collection by advertising in the classified columns of newspapers and magazines , including the @entity157 and @entity158			0
lunchtime ! soldiers eating rations			0
the comparatively primitive cameras of the day had trouble capturing quick movements due to their long exposure times bitter : much of the fighting happened in the dead of winter , as evidenced by the starkly naked trees which line this procession of allied troops captured : a @entity34 gun emplacement			0
in the great battles of the @entity6 , advances of even a few feet were won at the cost of thousands of lives camp : soldiers walk across an improvised bridge in freezing conditions			1
the owner of the photographs obtained them by placing classified newspaper adverts improvising : soldiers had to do what they could in grim conditions - which included everyday chores			2
here they dry their clothes on a bombed - out agricultural site he decided to sell much of his collection in several sales by @entity193 to mark the centenary of the outbreak of war			0
@entity198 @entity197 said : ' photographs from @entity6 are very rare , especially those taken on the @entity11			2
these photos are being sold by a private collector who has spent the last 40 years compiling artefacts from the @entity6			2
' he bought these photos in a job lot of around 70 pieces			0
they are original copy prints which makes them incredibly rare			2
some have been taken by press photographers and come with a stamp of the news organisation on the back			0
' but others do n’t have any stamp , which would suggest they were taken by the army ’s own photographers			0
' the point of the photographs was to portray the war in a good light and to convince more men to enlist			0
the few photos that were taken on the @entity11 were often posed by the soldiers , but these are real life pictures which makes them all the more poignant			0
' hard at work : a machine gun emplacement			0
@entity198 @entity197 said : ' photographs from @entity6 are very rare , especially those taken on the @entity11 ' on the march : not all the troops involved in fighting were @entity44 - here , soldiers from overseas saluted their own top brass during an event near the front line visitors : many of the photographs , including this one , came with no captions , leaving their origins mysterious bleak : with waters almost down to freezing point , even the job of filling a @entity244 can was an arduous one			1
the photographs tried to portray the war in a positive light unavoidable : even though they were meant to be positive , the grim reality of war could not be evaded			0
cart horses struggled and slipped in icy conditions , pictured			0

the 70 rarely - seen original prints caught soldiers during their everyday lives and are expected to fetch £ 3,000
one shows a serviceman attaching a message to a collie dog which would have been sent through @entity25
others depict gun posts , horses stuck in a bog and a ' dump ' where hundreds of 2ft artillery shells were stored
they were owned by a collector of @entity6 memorabilia near @entity141 , @entity142 , where they will be auctioned
