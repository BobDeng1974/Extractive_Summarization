[ headerlinks ] @entity0 the kitten who was born with two faces has died at the age of just two days - but not before reaching @entity7 stardom in her brief life			1
the rare @entity10 cat was born tuesday in @entity11 , @entity12 , with one body , two faces and an apparently healthy set of organs			1
on thursday , the feline 's owner , @entity16 , told the local station @entity18 that @entity0 died peacefully from health complications that morning			1
shortly afterwards , the newborn was rejected by its mother so ms @entity16 was feeding her by hand			1
the kitten was examined by a vet and everything appeared to be in good working order			0
ms @entity16 said : ' the kids actually found them and came in and said , " mom there 's a kitty with two heads , " and i said , " i think you guys are just tired , you 're crazy , that does n't happen			2
" ' @entity16 's veterinarian said that he was aware of only four ' @entity10 ' cats who have reached adulthood , with the two - faced @entity63 marvel named @entity64 and @entity65 being the oldest known feline living to the ripe - old age of 12			2
two of @entity36 's siblings from he same litter who were not afflicted with the ' @entity10 ' condition have survived			0
in february last year , a kitten born with two faces died after barely living to the age of just two days			2
@entity75 and @entity76 , of @entity77 , @entity78 , named him @entity80 after the character 's two - face alter - ego in @entity83			0
but the little guy died from complications			0
' @entity10 ' cats suffer from a condition called diprosopus , which almost always turns out to be fatal			0
most animals born with two faces have birth defects , including a cleft palate , that makes it difficult for them to nurse and often causes them to slowly starve or get milk in their lungs and die of pneumonia			0
