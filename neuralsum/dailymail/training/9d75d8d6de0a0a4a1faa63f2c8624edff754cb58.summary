by @entity1 reporter published : 20:41 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 05:12 est , 21 january 2014 the @entity4 's @entity3 has ruled @entity5 has stopped enriching uranium to 20 per cent			1
@entity8 's nation has always insisted the process was for energy purposes only @entity5 has halted its quest for weapons - grade uranium , according to the @entity13 € ™ s @entity3			1
inspectors from the @entity3 reported that @entity5 had stopped enriching uranium to 20 per cent purity , which is just one step away from the material required for a viable nuclear weapon			0
the move , which comes after @entity22 € ™ s talks between @entity5 and leading nations in @entity24 , marks the first stage of an agreement that could open the way for sanctions on the oil - dependent regime to be eased			1
@entity31 has always insisted that its uranium enrichment was for energy purposes , despite @entity35 concern			1
the @entity36 and @entity37 both suspended some trade and other restrictions against the @entity41 oil producer after the @entity4 ' nuclear watchdog confirmed that @entity5 had fulfilled its side of an agreement made on november 24			2
the announcements , which coincided with a diplomatic row over @entity5 's role at peace talks on @entity49 , will allow six months of negotiation			1
under the interim deal , @entity5 agreed to suspend enrichment of uranium to a fissile concentration of 20 percent , a short technical step away from the level needed for nuclear weapons			2
it also has to dilute or convert its stockpile of this higher - grade uranium , and cease work on the @entity62 heavy water reactor , which could provide plutonium , an alternative to uranium for bombs			0
the @entity3 said @entity31 had begun the dilution process and that enrichment of uranium to 20 percent had been stopped at the two facilities where such work is done			0
' @entity72 confirms that , as of january 20 , 2014 , @entity5 has ceased enriching uranium above five percent @entity73 at the two cascades at the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) and four cascades at the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) previously used for this purpose , ' its report to member states said			0
it was referring to @entity5 's two enrichment plants , at @entity80 and @entity81			2
cascades are linked networks of centrifuge machines that spin uranium gas to increase the concentration of @entity73 , the isotope used in nuclear fission chain reactions , which is found in nature at concentrations of less than one percent			0
the announcement coincided with a diplomatic row at the @entity4 , hosted by @entity93 , over @entity5 's role in the @entity49 peace talks however , analysts said much was still unclear about how world powers could achieve their goal of ensuring @entity5 can not , secretly or otherwise , develop the capability to build a nuclear weapon			1
@entity101 , head of the @entity102 in @entity103 and a proponent of tough sanctions on @entity5 , said that by providing short - term economic relief , the @entity106 was losing future bargaining power with @entity31			2
' the interim deal does nothing over the next 12 months to prevent @entity5 from proceeding with the nuclear - weapon and ballistic - missile research that are the keys to a deliverable nuclear weapon , ' he said			0
' ahead of final negotiations , @entity31 will be in a stronger position to block peaceful @entity35 efforts to dismantle its military - nuclear programme			0

move follows november talks *warning* oil - rich nation to take action
