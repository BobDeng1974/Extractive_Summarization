in its continuing bid to take on tv networks , @entity0 is busy preparing a slew of original programming			1
to date , the site has already released eight series that are available only on the digital platform			0
and this week , the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies			1
the @entity13 - based company has announced plans for more original shows			1
speaking at a conference in @entity18 , chief content officer @entity16 said the site would unveil about 20 shows for the platform in the next five years the announcement was made by chief content officer @entity16 in a conference in @entity18 earlier this week			1
he was reported as saying , by seeking @entity24 , that @entity0 wants to expand its original programming to ‘ as many as 20 original series ’			1
this is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as @entity30			0
mr @entity16 said the idea was to launch an ‘ original season of content every two and a half weeks ’ to get into a ‘ regular drumbeat with consumer expectation			1
’ earlier this year @entity0 agreed to pay @entity36 to ensure its video streams receive priority over the @entity40 network			0
it comes amid growing concern over @entity40 plans to throttle high - bandwidth services such as @entity0 - and claims from @entity0 boss @entity44 that payments are an ' arbitrary tax '			2
the deal came just weeks after a similar agreement with @entity49 was revealed			0
but it quickly paid off for @entity49 subscribers , and figures showed @entity0 's videos streamed through @entity49 's internet service at their highest speeds in 17 months			0
he continued that this does n’t necessarily mean a new show for everybody , but rather new shows for different ‘ segments of the viewership every couple of weeks			2
’ @entity0 is also planning to release more original movies , which include a sequel to @entity66 next year - subtitled ‘ @entity66 ’			1
the move follows news earlier in the year that @entity69 is also making its own original tv shows			1
the first of these will be comedies titled @entity74 and @entity75 , and they will be shown on the @entity69 website , mobile app , @entity78 and @entity80 devices			0
the series , which launch in 2016 , will be available free to be viewers			0
and beginning in the summer of 2015 , @entity69 is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with @entity85			2
the expansion makes @entity69 one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to @entity0			2
@entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high - speed internet connections			0
the shows will cater to a variety of tastes , with new shows being shown every two weeks			2
they will complement the site 's existing original series like @entity106 ( shown ) , which stars @entity107			0
@entity0 is also planning original movies including a @entity66 sequel @entity0 ’s move follows news earlier in the year that @entity69 will also release its own original tv shows in 2016 ( chief executive @entity113 shown )			1
the first of these will be comedies titled @entity74 and @entity75 , and they will be shown on the @entity69 website , mobile app , @entity78 and @entity80 devices			0
