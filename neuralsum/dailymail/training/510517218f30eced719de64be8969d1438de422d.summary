@entity1 forward @entity0 was presented with the @entity3 award for the best player at the @entity5 following his team 's defeat by @entity8 in sunday night 's final			1
although widely regarded as the greatest talent on the planet , most were surprised at the decision to hand @entity0 the award given his failure to score in all four knockout - stage matches			1
he has an understated ability which can dominate games just by his tactical intelligence and passing quality			2
but if we were judging up to the quarter - finals , i would have given it to @entity0 , just above @entity40			1
midfield general : @entity26 commiserates @entity0 after the @entity5 final @entity43 @entity44 : great tournament for goalkeepers and he was the best			1
match - winning contributions and great force of personality			2
his brilliance allows @entity8 to play the way they do , with adventure and risk			0
@entity56 @entity44 : the outstanding goalkeeper of the tournament			0
assured throughout and confirmed he is the best in the world in his position			0
safe hands : @entity8 and @entity64 no 1 was presented with the @entity65 for best goalkeeper @entity67 : @entity44 highlights @entity68 @entity69 : came in to the tournament with question marks over his appetite and his ethics and answered both with consistently brilliant displays throughout the tournament			2
went to ground too easily on occasion but also took more whacks and stayed up more than just about anybody else			0
@entity81 @entity82 : i think he was the perfect embodiment of what @entity8 represented			0
a fantastic work ethic , more than a touch of flair and a killer instinct			0
forward thinking : @entity69 ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) were two of the best attackers in the tournament @entity67 : @entity0 highlights			1
