nine people who own the brand - new @entity2 have already contacted @entity3 , upset about their warped devices , the tech giant said thursday			1
@entity3 went into damage control mode , addressing what has come to be known as ' @entity7 ' by claiming that costumers ' complaints about @entity10 warping are few and far between			2
the statement from the tech giant came just hours after @entity3 pulled back a flawed software update			1
' with normal use , a bend in @entity2 is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale , a total of nine customers have contacted @entity3 with a bent @entity2 , ' @entity3 spokeswoman @entity14 said in an email			1
the new devices have faced criticism and widespread ridicule over their apparent bendability			0
social media and online forums are overflowing with comments and memes poking fun at the phones ' ability to bend when placed in back pockets or while wearing skinny jeans			2
@entity3 said its new batch of iphones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high - stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry			1
the only way an @entity2 may have bent is if someone put it in their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time , said @entity60 , chief executive of @entity61 , which customizes and gold - plates iphones			1
@entity3 was also forced to withdraw a glitch - ridden update to its latest operating system after some users of its new phones complained of call service disruptions			1
' we apologize for the great inconvenience experienced by users , ' @entity70 said			0
@entity3 said on its website it was working on an @entity76 update to fix the issue , and will release it in the next few days			2
' i do believe this speaks to execution issues at @entity3 , " said @entity80 analyst @entity79			2
' at the end of the day i believe this too shall pass , but we are noting with concern that the miscues pile up			0
' @entity3 said on monday it had shipped 10million units of @entity2			1
users of the @entity2 also complained about the inability to use the fingerprint - reading @entity91 after updating to @entity76			1
' @entity10 feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high - stress points and use the strongest glass in the industry some users had complained of ' sluggish @entity100 and dwindling battery life ' after moving to @entity102 , @entity98 reported earlier this week			1
earlier today , @entity3 issued a step - by - step guide for users to reinstall @entity76 8 , launched last week , through the latest version of @entity106			2
the health app will not work for now and will be fixed in the next software update , the company said			0
customers might , however , hope for replacements for their bent @entity10 , depending on whether their devices passed an inspection , tech news website @entity116 reported , quoting an @entity3 support executive			1
cases of bent @entity10 5 and 5s had been reported in 2013 by @entity120 , a website that exclusively covers @entity3			1
rival smartphone manufacturers wasted no time taking digs at @entity3 's woes			2
a @entity126 ad featured a bending phone against its own product , while @entity130 ceo @entity129 said : ' i would challenge you guys to bend our @entity134			0
' bend it like @entity136 : ' @entity7 ' has gone viral on social media , with @entity3 's critics poking fun at the new phones ' apparent flexibility the reason for the bend is due to the @entity2 being made out of aluminium			1
aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so , if enough pressure is applied , it will bend and move			0
according to @entity149 , no part of either of the new @entity10 has more than a quarter of an inch ( 0.64cm ) of aluminium in any spot			0
this means that , in areas of the phones that are weakest , it â€™s possible it could be susceptible to bending			2
this is noticeable in images , with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the sim card slot			0
these areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and sim card , so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend			0
to stop the phone bending , users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone			0
for example , do not have it sideways in a pocket , as your pocket will push it against your leg , possibly causing bending			0
putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect , so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option			0
another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied .			0
