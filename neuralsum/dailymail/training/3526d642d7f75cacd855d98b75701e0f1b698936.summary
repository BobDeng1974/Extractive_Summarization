he shows moments of consciousness and awakening			1
we are on his side during his long and difficult fight , together with the team of the hospital in @entity34 , and we keep remaining confident			2
' she said no further details would be given out of respect to his family and to ' enable the medical team to work in full calmness '			1
@entity42 , a former @entity2 doctor , said ' awakening ' would mean that @entity1 has opened his eyes			1
he said : ' this eye opening can even be cyclic , following what looks just like a sleep - wake cycle ( even if not synchronised to real day - night hours )			1
' and he said the ' moments of consciousness ' meant that @entity1 would have had interaction with his environment			1
he said : ' it consists of episodes of clear , purposeful interaction with the environment , and / or clear signs of awareness of self , even if these signs are not constantly present			0
bring him home : reports says @entity61 plans to build a multi-million pound facility so @entity1 can leave hospital the Â £ 25 million estate on the shores of @entity66 , where @entity67 is installing the facility ' for example , if @entity1 smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him - reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions			1
or following people with his eyes			0
' or trying to communicate , or obeying simple commands			0
any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the " outside " and the " inside "			0
this then would be a minimally conscious state			0
and that is about the best news we could possibly get right now			0
' but despite the encouraging signs , @entity1 will not be moved from @entity85 anytime soon			2
his family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in wild rumours that his wife @entity61 ' has built or plans to build any kind of medical suite for @entity1 on any of the buildings on their land in @entity96 , @entity97			2
this includes future buildings '			0
