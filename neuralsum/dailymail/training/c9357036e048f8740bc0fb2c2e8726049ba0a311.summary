@entity1 in the fall and winter can be brutal and bundled up commuters generally walk briskly past one another avoiding any eye contact			2
a little girl warmed up the usually drab @entity6 platform on the l train at @entity8 in @entity9 last month as she danced to music by @entity6 buskers and started a hoedown in the process			1
the band @entity15 , who was playing a @entity18 cover of ' @entity19 , ' posted the video of the @entity1 moment on @entity22 and the video now has over 200,000 views			1
the little girl who started it all can be seen dressed all in pink and grooving out to the band 's tune			2
a green haired woman dances along with her			0
it does n't take much time before other people waiting for the train join in and dance too			0
at the end of the song the crowd is all in smiles and claps for the girl			0
likely they 'll be getting on the subway feeling a little bit lighter inside			0
instigator : this little girl ca n't help but dance her little heart out to buskers on the subway platform taking notice : commuters on the platform ca n't help but smile at the girl and shortly they 'll be dancing too all aboard : the little girl 's dance moves are contagious and other people waiting for the train ca n't help but join her in her spontaneous dance unanimous applause : when the song is over everyone is clapping and smiling and the little girl jumps happily into her proud papa 's arms			1
