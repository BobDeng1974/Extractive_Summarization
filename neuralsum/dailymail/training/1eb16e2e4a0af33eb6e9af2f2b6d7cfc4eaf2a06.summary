a great white shark seals the fate of this hapless sea creature - as it launches itself clear out of the water to snatch a snack			0
the dramatic series of images were captured at @entity7 , off the coast of @entity9 , @entity10			1
photographer @entity11 , from @entity12 , snapped 28 shark breaches in a single hour			1
the notorious shark - infested waters are said to be one of the only places in the world where sharks breach when hunting their prey - the @entity9 fur seal			2
snap happy : a great white shark breaches the water at @entity7 , off the coast of @entity9 , @entity10			2
unfortunately its dinner was a decoy seal deployed by photographer @entity11 to capture this amazing image @entity11 , an award winning international travel photographer , said : ' the behaviour of the @entity32 sharks in this area is unique			1
i wanted to get the @entity35 of shark images - the breach with a natural predation			0
' anyone who has photographed wildlife will know sightings of this type of behaviour are still rare to witness and more difficult to catch on camera			0
' @entity11 used a decoy seal towed by a boat during the second day of his trip when there was a lull in activity			1
but he still managed to capture real - life nature in action			0
force of nature : the enormous @entity32 , which can weigh more than 1,000kilos , soars several feet clear of the water as it hits the decoy seal clamping down : the ferocious predator sinks its razor - sharp rows of teeth into a seal just a few feet from where photographer @entity11 had his camera set up @entity10 he added : ' the only way to get a photo of this live action is to spot the seals returning from offshore fishing and then focus on a lone seal or one that has dropped off the back of a group			1
' by tracking just one seal , if you are lucky and the seal is not , you might get to see some action			0
' we witnessed our first breach within minutes of sunrise i had a breach shot within the first half hour			0
the action continued and we witnessed 28 predations in an hour - of which i managed to photograph three			2
then it all went quite			0
' you can see more of @entity11 ' work at @entity89 skill : award - winning photographer @entity11 honed in on a lonely seal which had become separated from the pack and vulnerable to attack in order to narrow his chances of spotting a stunning great white shark breaching the water what lurks beneath : a great white shark swims through the murky waters off in @entity102 , @entity10 , in search of a seal devastating : a seal stands no chance after being hit with huge force by a fearsome great white shark in @entity102 , @entity10			1
