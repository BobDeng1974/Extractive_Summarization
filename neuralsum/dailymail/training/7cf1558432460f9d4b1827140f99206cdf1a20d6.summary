the move has led to a spike in violence as the @entity14 have claimed it as an excuse to step up operations aimed at destabilizing his government			2
@entity20 was set up after the @entity0 - led invasion as an umbrella for the coalition of around 50 nations that provided troops and took responsibility for security across the country			1
it ends with 2,224 @entity0 soldiers killed , according to an @entity108 tally , out of a total of some 3,500 foreign troop deaths			2
the mission peaked at 140,000 troops in 2010 with a surge ordered by @entity0 president @entity114 to root the insurgents out of strategically important regions , notably in the southern provinces of @entity118 and @entity119 , where the @entity14 had its capital from 1996 to 2001			1
@entity114 recently expanded the remit of the @entity0 forces remaining in the country , allowing them to extend their counter-terrorism operations to @entity14 , as well as @entity126 , and to provide ground and air support for the @entity3 forces when necessary for at least the next two years			1
@entity3 have mixed feelings about the drawdown of foreign troops , many believing that with the deteriorating security situation their presence is needed to back up the @entity3 effort to bring peace after more than three decades of continual war			2
' at least in the past 13 years we have seen improvements in our way of life — freedom of speech , democracy , the people generally better off financially , ' said 42 - year - old shop keeper @entity145			2

in a statement on sunday , @entity161 said that @entity20 's mandate was ' carried out at great cost but with great success			2
' ' we have made our own nations safer by denying safe haven to international terrorists			0
we have made @entity3 stronger by building up from scratch strong security forces			0
together we have created the conditions for a better future for millions of @entity3 men , women and children , ' he said			0
as @entity3 forces assume sovereignty , the country is without a @entity190 three months after @entity85 's inauguration , and economic growth is near zero due to the reduction of the international military and aid juggernauts			2
