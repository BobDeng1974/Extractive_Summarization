@entity0 has admitted he will never forgive @entity1 for the way they treated him @entity1 winger @entity0 runs for the ball with @entity19 during their defeat by @entity22 @entity0 swaps shirts with @entity24 after @entity22 beat @entity1 at @entity25 last week @entity26 has since left @entity1 for @entity27 but the manager told @entity0 to find a new club he returned to @entity30 in december and was afforded an emotional welcome when he made his first appearance earlier this month during the 1 - 0 defeat at home to @entity35			1
but @entity0 â€“ who paid for his own medical treatment - says he remains hurt by the manner in which the club hierarchy and manager @entity26 told him he was not needed following his initial battle with cancer			1
' i wo n't be able to forgive the way i 've been treated , no , ' he said in an interview with @entity45			1
' i do n't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and i think at times like that , you should look after the individual , the player			2
' i was operated on in @entity15			0
the post-surgery studies were good and well , i went back to @entity54 after being discharged			0
' i returned mid-november ( 2013 ) and at the beginning to mid-december the manager said i should find myself another club , that it was best			2
i understand a lot of things about football that , well , that for the directors it is a business , no ? @entity0 pictured when he competed in the @entity63 marathon while he battled testicular cancer @entity0 gives a thumbs up as he ran the race in support of a cancer charity following his diagnosis ' it is clear that they look after the club 's interests , but i think in a situation like that , you need to save ( consider ) other things , even more as i had been playing for five years before having this problem			2
' and i never asked for anything			0
i paid for it [ medical treatment ] because , for me , the most important thing was my health			0
' @entity0 is out of contract in the summer and it is thought he will leave after seven years at @entity25			2

' i know the situation here ( at @entity1 ) is n't the easiest but i 'm going to fight to remain here			0
time will tell what i can do and it 's in my control to leave everything , to give the best of me and see how far i can get , ' he said			0
@entity0 has returned to @entity1 and hopes to stay despite admitting he can never forgive them @entity0 smiles during @entity1 's warm - up ahead of their @entity100 loss to @entity22 on march 21 ' without doubt one , after a problem like i had , sees things from a different perspective and the order of priorities changes			1
' but it 's also difficult to get other people to understand because for everyone their own troubles are more important , are n't they ? ' i think the most important thing is health			0
sometimes we get into a lot of trouble for things that really are n't significant			0
