by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:06 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 07:30 est , 10 august 2012 exciting images from @entity4 's curiosity rover show exactly what your eyes would see if you were standing on the surface of @entity9 on a late afternoon day			1
the excellent panoramic image is the first colour landscape photograph provided from the $ 2.5 billion @entity9 rover and was taken with the probe 's @entity13 which extend above the the spacecraft			1
the panoramic mosaic , comprising 130 separate images that @entity18 captured with its newly activated navigation cameras , shows a rust - colored , pebble - strewn expanse stretching to a wall of the crater 's rim in one direction and a tall mound of layered rock in another			2
a handout photo provided by @entity29 @entity4 on 09 august 2012 shows the first 360 - degree panorama in color of the @entity33 landing site taken by @entity4 's curiosity rover that formation , named @entity36 , stands at the center of the vast , ancient impact crater and several miles from where @entity18 touched down at the end of an eight - month voyage across 352 million mile ( 566 million km ) of space			1
the layers of exposed rock are thought to hold a wealth of @entity9 ' geologic history , making it the main target of exploration for scientists who will use the rover to seek evidence of whether the planet most similar to @entity53 might now harbor or once have hosted key ingredients for microbial life			2
the mission controllers also released the rover 's first self - portrait which was stitched together to show an uninterrupted view of @entity18 standing on the surface of the @entity9			1
eight shots were used to create the panoramic picture using the rover 's twin navigation cameras , or @entity65 which are used to capture 3d images			2
the 360 - degree panorama was created by @entity4 staff by electronically stitching together eight shots from the rover @entity70 , principal investigator , @entity71 , watches the amazing panoramic image being built up on screen the new also reveal more about @entity18 's arrival on the red planet			1
blast marks from the rocket engine 's that brought the car sized rover can clearly be seen in the image below , which forms part of the panorama			1
scientists believe that the soil on mars is relatively shallow , which will help @entity18 's instruments get access to the underlying rock easily			1
' these @entity65 images indicate that our powered descent stage did more than give us a great ride , it gave our science team an amazing freebie , ' said @entity96 , project scientist for the mission from the @entity98 in @entity99			0
' the thrust from the rockets actually dug a one - and - a - half - foot - long [ 0.5 meter ] trench in the surface			0
' it appears we can see @entity9 bedrock on the bottom			0
its depth below the surface is valuable data we can use going forward			0
' the panorama reveals dark marks on the surface caused tby the lander 's rocket engines as it descended @entity4 has also released more self portraits taken by the rover , which they have been using to check for signs of damage			1
visible in the photograph are pebbles resting on the top of the craft which have been kicked up by the landing of the multi-billion dollar exploration vehicle			0
however , mission controllers believe the craft is , so far , responding perfectly to their commands			0
a handout photo provided by @entity29 @entity4 on 09 august 2012 shows full - resolution self - portrait of the deck of @entity4 's @entity18 from the rover 's navigation cameras			1
pebbles are visible on the top part of the deck of @entity4 's @entity18 on @entity9 , taken from one of the rover 's navigation cameras looking toward the back left of the rover but mission controllers at the @entity143 near @entity144 are exercising caution immediately following @entity18 's jarring , death - defying descent to the surface on sunday night			1
they plan to spend weeks putting the nuclear - powered , six - wheeled rover and its sophisticated array of instruments through a painstaking series of ' health ' checks before embarking on the thrust of their science mission in earnest			0
the $ 2.5 billion curiosity project , formally named the @entity161 , is @entity4 's first astrobiology mission since the @entity164 probes of the 1970s and is touted as the first fully equipped mobile geochemistry lab ever sent to a distant world			1
@entity53 - like landscape : this image released by @entity4 and taken by cameras aboard the @entity18 rover shows the @entity9 horizon scientists say resembles the @entity172 comparing : the @entity172 stretches throughout southeastern and central @entity173 as well as southern @entity174 , southwestern @entity175 and northwestern @entity176 , in the @entity177 a strange blob is visible on the left conspiracy theorists have already worked themselves up into a lather over a mysterious blotch visible in the first black and white photographs taken from @entity4 's new @entity18 as it landed on @entity9			1
however , two hours later when the satellite made another pass over @entity18 , the rover sent another batch of images that revealed that the blotch had disappeared			2
after three full days on the @entity9 , ' @entity18 continues to behave flawlessly ' and has ' executed all planned activities ' without a hitch , mission manager @entity189 said at a @entity143 news briefing			0
the latest round of equipment checks included an instrument designed to determine mineral composition of powdered rock and soil samples ; one to analyze soil and atmospheric samples for organic compounds ; one to detect traces of water locked in shallow mineral deposits ; and another that uses particle x-rays to identify chemical elements in rocks and soils			0
the very delivery of @entity18 to the surface of @entity9 already has been hailed by @entity4 as the greatest feat of robotic spaceflight			2
the car - sized rover , which flew from @entity53 encased in a protective capsule , blasted into the @entity9 sky at hypersonic speed and landed safely seven minutes later after an elaborate , daredevil descent combining a giant parachute with a rocket - pack that lowered the rover to the @entity9 surface on a tether			0
since then , the rover has been sending a string of early images back to @entity53 , relayed by two @entity4 satellites orbiting @entity9 , providing glimpses of a terrain that scientists say appear reminiscent of the @entity172 in @entity173			2
one shot beamed back late wednesday night , the first taken by @entity18 of itself , shows the rover 's top deck strewn with dark pebbles apparently kicked up from the ground when the craft landed			1
@entity4 scientists said the gravel does not appear to pose any risk to instruments on the vehicle			0
two separate high - resolution ' @entity65 ' images taken of the surface show that thrust from the sky - crane rockets during descent carved out a 1.5 - foot ( 0.5 - meter ) trench in the surface , exposing what appears to be @entity9 bedrock underneath			0
when @entity18 wakes up for its fourth day on @entity9 , early friday @entity173 time , mission controllers plan to conduct additional instrument checks and prepare the craft for an upgrade of its main computer software for surface operations			2
all other activities will be suspended during that upgrade , which will begin on day 5 of the mission and last four days			0
