by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 14:26 est , 27 february 2013 flat pack shelters that take just 30 minutes to assemble have been designed to help save lives during natural disaster			1
when earthquakes , storms , floods , forest and bushfires and landslides hit a region , one of the problems faced by rescue and humanitarian services is providing a safe place to treat the wounded and provide shelter for those who have lost their homes			0
they also have a hinge that allows them to be collapsed like accordions			0
the company says the shelters are lightweight , flexible and sturdy and , when folded flat and not in use , packed six to a group on the back of a truck , meaning they can be transported easily and efficiently to wherever they are needed most , without needing unwieldy heavy machinery			1
the walls are made from insulated thermal panels , similar to a supermarket cold storage room , and can withstand temperatures ranging from -20c ° to 49c °			2
a hinge in the centre upright wall means the @entity24 can be built even quicker if lifted by a crane the modular design means that a number of the shelters can be used to create larger dwellings with as many doors and windows as needed			1
each model also comes with electrical wiring and led lights			0
they also come in different designs , such as camouflage for the military or a red cross for humanitarian efforts			0
the @entity24 was launched last year at an expo in @entity76 and the creators are currently in negotiations with mining companies to provide housing for workers as well as the @entity20 armed forces			1
@entity83 : the @entity85 mid-construction			0
its flat pack design means it is easy to transport the walls are insulated and can endure both freezing and extreme heat as well as humanitarian aspects , the designers say it could have industial and military applications			2

the shelters can be assembled by two men and lie flat when not needed
@entity24 could *revolutionise* disaster *response* efforts
they are insulated and even have heating and lighting
