bombing : on april 19 , 1995 , two former @entity3 soldiers @entity145 and @entity147 conspired to bomb the @entity148 in downtown @entity132 there 's plenty of other pages who served during the war on terror , and we do n't know what they 're going to be doing over the next decade or so , ' said @entity156 , author of the forthcoming book ' @entity158 : how the @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 to fight the @entity162			1
' @entity156 argues the @entity18 military was so desperate for troops while fighting simultaneous wars in @entity166 and @entity167 that it allowed extremists , felons and gang members into the armed forces			1

' this is the best we 've ever seen , ' said @entity213 , leader of the @entity47 's intelligence project , referring to the @entity41 's attitute			2

he called the military 's reaction when alerted to white supremacists ' patchy			0
' ' we 've discovered a great range of response , from getting a phone call the next day saying , ' he 's already out , ' to not doing anything at all , ' @entity243 showed @entity119 a one - hour presentation it says was designed to educate soldiers and @entity3 leaders about its extremism policy and how to respond , including to white supremacy groups			1
tale of the tattoo : @entity3 leaders are urged to look out for tattooed symbols of lightning bolts , skulls , swastikas , eagles and @entity263 warriors penalties for extremist ideology may include being removed from the military , having security clearances yanked or being demoted			1

with the @entity18 withdrawn from @entity166 , winding down from @entity167 and unemployment stuck above 8 per cent , recruiters can be choosy again			2

for neo-nazis who get past the screeners , as with the gang members , the military needs a comprehensive strategy , said @entity361 , a former military investigator who is now a professor of criminal justice at @entity363 in @entity364			2
' they are some of the most disciplined soldiers we have			0
they really want to learn to shoot those weapons , ' @entity361 said			0
