@entity0 the pug - a dog who owes her life to @entity5 and onesies after being born with a debilitating stretchy skin condition			1
@entity9 's skin is so fragile that it blisters and tears at the slightest touch , with the condition so severe that vets advised putting the dog down when she was just a few weeks old			1
but devastated owner @entity16 came up with the method of dressing her pug in the protective clothes to stop @entity9 from rubbing and damaging her skin			1
mrs @entity16 , from @entity42 , @entity43 , said : ' i love wrapping her up in clothes			2
she needs the protection because her skin is so weak but it makes me feel nice too			2
she looks absolutely adorable but it 's also for her own good , it 's kept her alive			0
' the vets said she would probably tear her skin so often it would be kindest to put her down , but i could n't give up on her and knew i would find a way to keep her safe			1
' she has a lack of collagen in her body , meaning that she has nothing to hold her skin in place , but the @entity5 really help her - it 's amazing			1
' @entity9 has a condition called @entity32 , which causes her excessively stretchy skin to tear easily			1
the condition can also affect humans			0
dogs suffering from the condition do not usually survive beyond their first few months , but at almost two years old , @entity9 is still going strong			1
most dogs with @entity9 's condition do not live beyond a few months , but the dog is now two years old thanks to mrs @entity16 's idea of wearing protective clothing the pampered dog 's extensive wardrobe includes six @entity5 , two cardigans , two coats and one @entity39 jumper however , mrs @entity16 was on the brink of giving up on her young puppy in christmas 2013 when @entity9 , just seven months old , needed an operation to repair her hips			1
the 41 - year - old said : ' afterwards she had so many tears and holes in her body , the vet advised us to put her down but she was only a puppy and so full of love			2
we just could n't do it			0
' today , @entity9 is still going strong despite having to be checked for cuts on a regular basis			1
she is now 18 months old and is showing no signs of slowing down			0
mrs @entity16 said : ' she does n't even notice that there 's anything wrong			0
she runs around like a maniac , is extremely playful and loves her life			0
' in some positions she looks like she 's wearing a hoodie because her skin hangs about two inches underneath her body and gathers all around her joints			2
' sometimes , she 's got so much excess skin that you can wrap your hand in her like a glove			2
' she 's never in pain			0
she does n't even notice any new cuts until she starts playfully licking them			0
' @entity9 , pictured when she was a puppy , is playful and energetic just like any other young dog the pug underwent an operation on her hips when she was seven months old but fortunately pulled through now @entity9 is helping other dogs with the condition and has a @entity116 page called ' my name is @entity9 ...			1
@entity32 will not beat me ! ! ' mrs @entity16 said : ' people from all over the world have joined to get help and advice from her and me			0
' someone even sent me a medical ointment , called @entity125 , that is usually used on horses , which we 've found is really helpful for treating @entity9 's wounds			1
a spokesman for the @entity131 said : ' dogs show not only the same clinical and pathological features as humans with @entity32 but they also have the same problems with medical management			0
' dogs with @entity32 have skin and joint laxity that far exceeds that of any normal dog			2
often , they have luxated hip joints but do not appear to have pain associated with it			0
' despite the shorter life expectancy , they are able to run and play like most other dogs			0
