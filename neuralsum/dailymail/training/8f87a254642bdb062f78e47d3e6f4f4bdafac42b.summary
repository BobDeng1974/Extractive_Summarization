by @entity0 published : 17:20 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 27 august 2013 standing in line for a chance to see her within minutes of the zoo opening yesterday , the visitors ’ mood was pregnant with excitement			1
that much , at least , can be said with certainty , despite it still being unconfirmed if @entity10 , the furry focus of thousands ’ fascination every day , is expecting a cub			1
but such is the air of expectancy over the mere possibility , that pre-booked viewing slots to see her and her male partner @entity19 are now sold out for days in advance			0
pre-booked viewing slots to see @entity10 and her male partner @entity19 are now sold out for days in advance since the news that she may be pregnant the 10 year - old panda could give birth at any point over the next two weeks the female giant panda rests at @entity28 zoo today in preparation for what could be the first birth of a giant panda in the @entity33 only a limited number of tickets are being released each morning on a first come , first served basis as fans flock to @entity38 for a peek before the @entity33 ’s only female giant panda pops ( if , indeed , she ever does )			1
from toddlers in pushchairs to octogenarians with walking sticks , those lucky enough to have places on yesterday ’s coveted viewing slots patiently waited to enter the panda enclosure in groups of 50 at a time			1
a notice board outside warned ‘ all panda viewing time slots are fully booked ’ , but , after paying the zoo ’s £ 16 entrance fee , i was lucky enough to nab one of the last places , which cost nothing extra , on the 9.30am visit			1
first you are led into a viewing area where you can see into the ten - year - old ( ok ) pandas ’ indoor enclosure through floor - to - ceiling windows			0
the blinds were down on @entity10 ’s , part of the process hopeful keepers are using to help mimic the atmosphere of a den that she would seek in the wild to have a cub in			1
@entity19 briefly stuck his head round the entrance to his , but that was all we saw of him			0
no pacing up and down like an expectant father - but then , panda dads do leave raising the kids to mum			2
in the outdoor viewing area , we were graced with @entity10 ’s presence			1
she bounded up her climbing frame and lay down on top of it for a few minutes			2
a chorus of ‘ oohs ’ and ‘ aahs ’ greeted her arrival as cameras clicked away			0
exiting via the zoo shop , you are surrounded by ‘ panda - phernalia ’ of every sort : t - shirts , tea towels , pens , fridge magnets , masks - you name it , they ’ve got it and it ’s all emblazoned with a panda			1
cuddly pands toys alone are selling at a rate of 5,000 a week			0
yesterday children were going homes with armfuls of the stuff			0
there is a chance @entity10 , seen roaming her @entity38 enclosure today , could reject the foetuses or that her body could reabsorb them @entity19 enjoys his free time at @entity38 while @entity10 , who is possible pregnant , rests in her ' off show area ' after @entity19 and @entity10 failed to mate naturally , experts artificially inseminated the female giant panda with @entity19 's semen so the cub or cubs will still be his @entity125 , 33 , a customer relations manager for an energy firm , visiting with his niece @entity128 , two , from @entity129 , said : ‘ it ’s not @entity38 - it ’s panda zoo			1
it ’s all about the panda here - everything is panda , panda , panda			2
’ @entity137 , 48 , a business analyst from @entity139 , @entity140 , who was visiting with his wife @entity141 , 47 , and daughters @entity143 , 15 and 13 - year - old @entity144 , booked their panda slot in advance via the zoo ’s website to avoid disappointment			1
‘ we saw @entity10 , i was quite surprised as i thought she ’d be sleeping , ’ he said			1
‘ a cub would be brilliant , it ’d generate even more interest in conservation			0
’ @entity154 , 80 , of @entity28 , who has been visiting for 50 years , said : ‘ it ’ll be very interesting if they have a cub - and good for @entity28 and good for the zoo			2
’ the zoo revealed on monday that hormone tests suggest @entity10 is expecting and could give birth to what would be the first panda cub to be born in the @entity33 any day now			1
but such are the peculiarities of panda biology , no one can be 100 per cent sure until she actually goes into labour			2
it would n’t be her first cub			0
she had twins in 2009 at the zoo in @entity172 which loaned her and @entity173 ( he was not the father on that occasion , but this time he may turn out to be ) to @entity33			2
unlike humans , pandas are as likely to have twins as they a single cub , but as they are only able to rear one cub at a time , when born in captivity the second cub is cared for by keepers			0
by all accounts , she was a good mum too , picking up her newborns , cradling them in her arms and affectionately licking them			0
will such heart - warming scenes be witnessed in @entity28 ? keepers say she could give birth at any time in the next two weeks			0
in the meantime , all any of us can do is grin and , er , bear it as we await the hoped - for happy day .			0

crowds queue to see @entity10 within minutes of zoo opening
but it is still unconfirmed whether the giant panda is pregnant
limited tickets are released each morning on first come , first served basis
