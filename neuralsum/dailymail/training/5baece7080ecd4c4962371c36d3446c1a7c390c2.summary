@entity0 will pay a $ 7 million fine to settle a multistate @entity3 investigation into a software snooping program that the firm admitted was on its @entity8 mapping cars			1
the software enabled the search giant to intercept emails , passwords and other sensitive information sent over unprotected wireless networks in neighborhoods across the world			1
the agreement covers 38 states and the @entity19 , part of the area where households and local merchants unwittingly had some of their communications on @entity27 networks snatched by @entity0 from early 2008 until the spring 0f 2010			1
a @entity0 street view car pictured in @entity30 , @entity31 : the firm is now being forced to pay $ 7m for intercepting emails and other information from open wifi networks the cars drove past a @entity8 camera fastened on top of a car in @entity40 on march 19 , 2009 the fine works out to roughly the same amount of revenue that @entity0 makes per hour , and campaigners say it is not enough			1
' the penalty wo n't be enough to prevent @entity0 from continuing to be a ' serial privacy violator , ' according to @entity47 , privacy project director for @entity49			2
the company brings in an average of $ 7 million per hour , based on its projected revenue of $ 61 billion this year			2
' it 's clear the internet giant sees fines like this as just the cost of doing business and not a very big cost at that , ' said @entity60			0
@entity0 stopped the data collection in may 2010 , shortly before the company revealed cars taking street - level photos for its online mapping service also had been grabbing information transmitted over @entity27 networks that had been set up in homes and businesses without requiring a password to gain access			1
the company blamed the intrusion on a rogue engineer who rigged a data - collection program into equipment that was supposed to only detect basic information about local @entity27 networks to help plot the locations of people using its mapping service and other products			1
after concluding its own investigation , the @entity84 last year asserted that some of @entity0 's managers knew about the engineer 's plan to vacuum information being transmitted over the @entity27 networks			1
@entity0 has n't identified the engineer who set up the data - collection program			1
the surveillance triggered outrage among privacy watchdogs and government investigations in more than a dozen countries			0
the backlash so far has been more of a public relations blow than a financial setback for @entity0 , which has embraced ' @entity99 ' as its corporate motto			2
even as it repeatedly apologized for a breach of online etiquette , @entity0 insisted that it did n't break any laws in the @entity3 the company is maintaining that position in the multistate investigation by entering into a settlement that does n't include any admission of wrongdoing			0
@entity0 , based in @entity110 , @entity111 , released another contrite statement tuesday			0
' we work hard to get privacy right at @entity0 , ' the company said			0
' but in this case we did n't , which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue			0
' how @entity0 's @entity8 works the multistate agreement requires @entity0 to destroy the personal data that it collected from the @entity27 networks , unless a lawsuit or other legal action requires the information to be preserved			1
a series of class - action lawsuits are still being appealed in @entity129 federal court			0
@entity0 says it never looked at the data , although regulators in other countries have reviewed the information as part of their investigations			1
@entity137 regulators said @entity0 had obtained the full names , telephone numbers and address of some people using the unprotected @entity27 networks			1
in @entity144 regulators found that @entity0 had grabbed an email exchange between a married man and woman discussing a possible affair and other information about sexual preferences			2
the @entity27 snooping is just the latest of several incidents that have raised questions about @entity0 's commitment to privacy			0
@entity0 's street view cars have become a common sight on roads around the world - however , for a time they were also found to be snooping on open wifi networks as they drove by in the past three years , @entity0 also has been reprimanded by @entity3 regulators for exposing the personal contact lists of its email accountholders when it started a service called @entity167 in 2010 and for secretly tracking the online activities of web surfers using @entity171 's @entity170 last year			1
the @entity170 surveillance resulted in the @entity173 fining @entity0 $ 22.5 million last year			2
the @entity84 also fined @entity0 $ 25,000 last year for obstructing its investigation into the @entity27 spying			2
the $ 7 million fine that @entity0 is paying the states and @entity19 is the biggest @entity3 penalty imposed on @entity0 so far for @entity27 spying			1
@entity180 , the lead state in the @entity27 investigation , will get the largest cut from the fine - nearly $ 521,000			1
other states getting a share are : @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity111 , @entity188 , @entity190 @entity189 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity19			0
the multistate agreement also requires @entity0 to create an instructional video for its @entity223 site to help people learn to protect their @entity27 networks from interlopers			2
the video will be promoted with daily online ads for the next two years			0
@entity27 privacy tips also will be provided in print ads that @entity0 must buy in major newspapers in all the states covered by the settlement			0
@entity0 also will host an annual " privacy week " for its employees for the next decade			0
' consumers have a reasonable expectation of privacy , ' said @entity180 attorney general @entity238			0
' this agreement recognizes those rights and ensures that @entity0 will not use similar tactics in the future			0

campaigners say fine is not enough - as @entity0 makes $ 7m in an hour
