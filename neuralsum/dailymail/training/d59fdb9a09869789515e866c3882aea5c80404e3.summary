from next year , children in @entity1 will not be compulsorily taught cursive handwriting			1
instead of learning this skill , schools will be given the choice to teach keyboard typing in its place			1
the country 's education board said the change reflects how typing skills are now more relevant than handwriting , but experts claim the move could damage a child 's brain development			1
from next year , children in @entity1 will not be compulsorily taught cursive handwriting ( stock image )			1
instead of learning this skill , schools will be given the choice to teach keyboard typing in its place			1
the country 's education board said the change reflects how typing skills are now more relevant than handwriting the changes do n't officially come into force until the start of next year 's autumn term			1
@entity30 from the @entity31 told @entity32 that ' fluent typing skills are an important national competence '			1
it follows changes made to the @entity37 in the @entity38 , in september 2013 , in which the @entity38 similarly removed cursive handwriting as a compulsory skill			1
as of last year , 43 states had adopted the standard , @entity44 had endorsed it , @entity43 had withdrawn , @entity41 and @entity42 had repealed it , and the rest of the states were non-members or had not adopted it			1
@entity51 additionally passed the @entity53 bill to reintroduce cursive into the classroom , which led to a number of complaints			1
a predominant criticism is that , while handwriting is important , cursive handwriting is no longer deemed necessary			1
' most [ people ] would agree that everyone should at least be able to pick up a pen or pencil and craft a message that others can read , ' said @entity67 , senior lecturer in language , literacy and @entity70 at @entity71			0
' but beyond legibility , does it matter how you form your letters when you hand write ? ' she continued there is research linking fluent handwriting with better written compositions , ' but the key is n’t the quality , form or style of the handwriting , but rather the automaticity of the handwriting			2
' reports have found that by the age of eight , children can already type faster than they can handwrite			2
but , further research said that learning to write in cursive improves a person 's motor and visual skills , eye - to - hand co-ordination , spatial awareness , hand and finger dexterity , cognitive function and brain development @entity102 is the theory that the less a person has to concentrate on forming their letters correctly , the more brain space they can devote to getting their message right			1
however , writing automaticity is just as easily achieved on a keyboard , and ms @entity67 said it 's more time efficient to teach a child to type than it is to teach them a particular handwriting style			1
in a recent study from @entity119 , researchers conducted brain scans on five - year - olds before and after receiving different letter - learning tasks			0
in children who practiced writing letters by hand , the neural activity was more enhanced and ' adult - like ' than in those who had simply looked at letters			2
and , the brain ’s so - called ' reading circuit ' - a region of linked connections that become active when reading - was activated during handwriting , but not during typing			1
reports have also found that by the age of eight , children can already type faster than they can handwrite			2
but , as ms @entity67 acknowledged , handwriting can play a crucial part in brain development			2
' although the ease , speed and versatility of technology are widely acknowledged , handwriting proponents say that how we learn to write does indeed matter			2
' research indicates that learning to write in cursive further improves students ' motor and visual skills , eye - to - hand co-ordination , spatial awareness , hand and finger dexterity , cognitive function and brain development			1
' they say the physical act of handwriting also facilitates the retention of information and the flow of ideas			2
' for example , in a recent study from @entity119 , researchers conducted brain scans on five - year - olds before and after receiving different letter - learning tasks			0
in children who practiced writing letters by hand , the neural activity was more enhanced and ' adult - like ' than in those who had simply looked at letters			2
and , the brain ’s so - called ' reading circuit ' - a region of linked connections that become active when reading - was activated during handwriting , but not during typing			1
graphology is the study of handwriting			2
graphologists analyse the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting and make assumptions about their identify , including the person 's mental state , as well as personality traits			1
writing consists of three things - movement , spacing and form - and a graphologist studies these variations and attaches interpretations to them			2
@entity181 @entity198 recently analysed the handwriting of the @entity201 team as part of the @entity204 campaign from @entity205			2
@entity181 @entity198 recently analysed the handwriting of the @entity201 team			0
he said : ' @entity206 is a friendly , sociable and balanced ' , seen by the right slant of the script ( 1 ) , close word spacing ( 2 ) and rhythmic nature			0
' she has mental drive ' seen by the long ‘ t ’ bar ( 3 ) and stubborn determination to do an accurate job ' , denoted by the ‘ d ’ structure ( 4 ) and the straight zone ( 5 and 6 ) ' although prepared to look at the unfamiliar , represented by the high ‘ i ’ dot ( 1 ) , @entity218 is practical and likes to focus on short range projects ' - seen in the low ‘ t ’ bars ( 2 )			0
' she is loyal ( seen with close word spacing and structure ( 3 and 4 ) but wants to ensure she gets her point across ' - seen with ' trumpet word endings ' ( 5 ) ' we were all taught to write in a specific way when we were children at school , but it is evident that no one continues to write exactly the way they were taught and everyone ’s handwriting looks different , ' explained the @entity235 of @entity181			0
' the reason is that our personalities affect the way our handwriting develops after we were taught to write			0
' this is because handwriting is the pattern of our psychology expressed in symbols on the page and these symbols are as unique as our own dna			0
' however , despite the fact it has previously been used in court cases as a form of forensic evidence , the practice is deemed controversial and has been dubbed a ' pseudoscience			0
' ' @entity253 is capable of determined concentration ' , seen by the down stroke cutting through the base line ( 2 ) , ' and likes to take an intellectual approach to projects ' ( high upper zone at 3 )			0
' he is unlikely to act impulsively ' seen by the rising ‘ m ’ at ( 4 ) and is ' sensitive to criticism which motivates him to set high standards ' , represented by the open ‘ t ’ stem ( 6 )			0
his twisted slants ( 7 ) show he likes to verify ideas mr @entity198 's analysis said @entity268 's style shows she 's active , seen by a fast , right slant ( 1 ) , who works well in fast - moving environments			0
this is represented by the right - placed ' t ' bar ( 2 ) and angles ( 3 )			0
he added that her writing falls below the line ( 4 ) suggesting she is weighed down by her responsibilities other points that mr @entity198 noted during the analysis is that close and overlapping lines show a need to be involved in a mass of different projects			0
ascending base lines show energy , enthusiasm and initiative , while extremely long ' t ' bars show a need to move forward with new ideas that come along			0
he added that small writing shows a good ability to concentrate but can also suggest an introverted person , and slant changes and a sudden upsurge in height shows impulsiveness			1
curved , looped rhythmic writing shows altruism , friendliness and a sense of balance			0
and it pressure of the writing increases towards the end of words it symbolises increased commitment to a project as time goes on a tall ‘ k ’ structure shows defiance , and if letters reach down into the lower zone that represents the area of materialism			1
in a recent study from @entity119 , researchers conducted brain scans ( pictured ) on 5 - year - olds before and after receiving different letter - learning tasks			0
in children who practiced writing letters by hand , the neural activity was more enhanced and ' adult - like ' than in those who had simply looked at letters earlier this year , @entity331 ’s learning designer dr. @entity330 told @entity201 that schools are already ditching pens and paper for tablets			1
she said there is an emerging focus on skills that go beyond the core curriculum , including skills such as collaboration , grit and perseverance , music and creativity , and problem solving skills			0
‘ technology can encourage and support numerous child development and educational objectives , such as physical activity and health , ' explained dr @entity330			0
' and there is a body of research supporting the notion that children learn best when they ’re having fun			0
' but as ms @entity67 concluded : ' with so many things to do in a school day , it is hard to see why dedicated handwriting lessons persist			1
' no matter how standardised we attempt to make handwriting , we all end up with our own style			0
' so perhaps there are better things to do in the school day than have children complete pages of handwriting exercises			1
' perhaps we ’d do just as well to let children play with drawing and writing implements and find their own style			0

from 2016 , @entity1 schools wo n't compulsorily teach cursive handwriting
instead , schools will be given the choice to teach typing in its place
it follows changes made to the @entity37 in the @entity38
member states are not *obliged* to teach cursive handwriting or *calligraphy*
experts have found handwriting helps boost a child 's cognitive ability
but other believe teaching writing is a waste of time in the *modern* day
