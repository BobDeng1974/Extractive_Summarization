the piece was titled with your wings , an inspirational story about a black pilot that @entity7 wrote for @entity0 ' program , and it seemed to disappear almost as soon as it was aired			1
there are no records of with your wings appearing in book or magazine form			2
even some @entity7 experts , including scholar @entity21 and antiquarian @entity22 , know little about it			1

unearthed : the transcript of a story written by @entity7 author @entity7 ( pictured ) will be published friday in @entity30 , a magazine that specializes in reissuing obscure works by famous writers ' and that 's saying something if i have n't heard of it			1
' it 's also surprising because you would think that anything @entity7 was involved with would be printed some place			2
' but 70 years after @entity0 ' introduction in the midst of @entity45 , with your wings is getting a second release			1
@entity47 , managing editor of the @entity49 , @entity50 - based quarterly @entity48 , came upon the transcript recently while looking through archives at the @entity53			1

flashback : the story with your wings was written by @entity7 ( left ) and read on the radio in 1944 by @entity0 ( right ) but has been missing since			1
until now ' @entity7 was an idealist			2
he saw @entity74 as this wonderful land with so much to offer but on the flip side , he could see inequality , he could see greed and excess destroying the working classes , ' @entity47 wrote			0
' this story strikes me as an effort to show @entity74 that african - americans were carrying on a huge burden in defending the @entity86 and the allies during the war			1
' released friday : the @entity30 is a magazine that specializes in reissuing obscure works by famous writers an avid supporter of the war , @entity7 worked overseas as a correspondent in the 1940s and , according to biographer @entity95 , wrote a favorable book about the @entity97 called bombs away ! @entity22 noted that @entity7 had favored ' unusual ' stories instead of describing the daily briefings from military officials			1
with your wings at first reads like a standard narrative of a veteran 's return , a plot used by everyone from @entity109 to @entity110			2
second lieutenant @entity111 has completed his training and at a farewell ceremony receives silver wings , pinned to his chest			0
he climbs into his ' clattering ' @entity116 @entity117 and sets out for an unidentified hometown			0
he appears to be greeted as a hero , or at least a celebrity , passing ' crowded porches ' and children ' washed and dressed in their best and starchiest clothes , hairs bursting with ribbons '			0
' he could hear the rustle as the neighbors moved silently near and formed a half circle behind him , ' @entity7 writes			2
' it was as though his own people were sitting in judgment on him			0
' @entity111 's sense of obligation is made more clear and powerful when @entity7 reveals that he is black , at a time the military was segregated			1
' he took off his cap with the gold eagle on it and held it in his hand			0
he saw his tall father lick his lips			0
and then his father said softly , '' son , every black man in the world is going to fly with your wings '' , ' @entity7 writes			1
' his heart was pounding			0
' he could hear a little quiet murmur of voices in front of the house			0
' he knew they were going to sing in a moment			0
' and he knew now what he was to them			0
