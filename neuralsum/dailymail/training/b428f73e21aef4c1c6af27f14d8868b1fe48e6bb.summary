@entity1 scientists are stranded after their @entity3 base lost power in the depths of winter as temperatures plummeted to a record low of minus @entity8			1
there is no way of rescuing the 13 researchers from the @entity12 - which has been hit by a 19 - hour blackout - for months until the hostile winter subsides			1
the @entity15 admitted it was a ' serious incident ' and has suspended all experiments as the workers heat up emergency accommodation which has not been used for months			1
there is no way they can be rescued ( file photo ) warming up : workers maintain a generator at the site , around which temperatures dropped to minus @entity33 remote : the research station was completed in 2012 and consists of ' modules ' on hydraulic movable legs some of the fallout from the power cut , which happened a week ago but was only revealed today , is still ongoing as the workers face sleeping on the floor of a garage			1
but despite the perilous conditions the scientists , 10 @entity43 , one @entity44 , one @entity45 and one @entity46 , have remained upbeat - and even tweeted about their ordeal			1
renewable energy engineer @entity49 wrote : ' whilst all the fun was happening at # halley6 ( not that it 's over ) we had the lowest ever recorded temps down here at -55.4			0
' got internet , lots of @ @entity58 tea and a big kettle			1
really , what more do you actually need ? ' he added on his blog : ' i would just like to reiterate that we are all healthy , in good spirits and are busy setting about getting , and keeping the station in as good an order as possible			0
stiff upper lip : renewable energy engineer @entity49 , one of the 13 scientists trapped inside the base with failing power , has kept the world updated with his tongue - in - cheek @entity75 reports about the weather beautifully isolated : there is no way the researchers at the station , pictured , can be rescued until winter ends nice view : at least the trapped scientists have a good vantage point to watch the patterns of the @entity86 ' no one here on station is responsible for the technical issues we are having and we are all working extremely hard			1
' another fairly cool , but problematic at the time , event occurred around the time of us losing power – the coldest temperature ever recorded at @entity98			1
' throwing a cup of boiling water into the air resulted in small explosion as the water instantly turned into a cloud of ice crystals			0
' this obviously did n’t help us on station at the time but it was nice to see a record set ! a @entity15 spokesman told @entity112 the temperature inside the building had dropped almost to freezing			1
he added : ' we ca n't get anyone in to help them because it 's the winter			2
' but he insisted there was no threat to their safety , saying : ' they have a building which is usually used as overspill accommodation for the summer months			2
' it 's been shut down since the summer , so we 're bringing that back into service and slowly warming it up			0
' there 's also a garage which is heated that they can sleep in			2
it 's not ideal , but it 's safe			2
' some people have been saying they 're going to freeze to death			0
that 's not going to happen			0
' isolated : the location of the research station in @entity98 , which has been used by scientists since the 1950s the state - of - the - art research station opened two years ago on a 150m - thick @entity142 in @entity98 , @entity3 , where researchers have been based since the 1950s			1
run by the @entity147 - based survey , it consists of eight ' modules ' on hydraulic legs which can lift above huge layers of snow and ice which accumulate in the winter			2
the design was an attempt to prevent the fate of previous research bases which were buried under ice and snow during serious weather			0
although the station is completely inaccessible to the outside world , there is an on - site doctor			0
a @entity15 statement said : ' @entity15 ( @entity15 ) is dealing with a serious operational incident at its @entity98			1
' our urgent priority is to ensure the continued safety and wellbeing of the wintering team			0
inhospitable : the base opened in 2012 after four years ' work and is on the 150m - thick @entity142 @entity173 : the research station in calmer weather			0
it currently has just 13 scientists living in it ' @entity179 and some heating are back online , and some other essential services have been restored , but the staff are having to live and work in extremely difficult conditions			1
' it is now clear that because of the nature of the incident , and the prolonged loss of power , the station can not now return to normal operation in the short or medium term			0
' everyone at @entity98 and @entity147 is doing everything that can be done to ensure that the incident remains under control			2
' all science , apart from meteorological observations essential for weather forecasting , has been stopped			0

13 staff were staking out depths of polar winter at @entity98
base lost power and heat for 19 hours in ' extremely difficult conditions '
@entity15 said temperature inside dropped almost to freezing
winter is so hostile that the researchers , 11 @entity1 , can not be rescued
all science operations suspended as emergency *contingency* plans prepared
@entity15 insisted they are safe as there is extra accommodation they can sleep in
researcher tweeted relief at having ' lots of @entity227 and a big kettle '
