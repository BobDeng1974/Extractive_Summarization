by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 13:18 est , 25 march 2013 when @entity2 was handed her newborn son after a gruelling 36 hour - long labour , she expected to feel relief and the overwhelming surge of love			1
but when midwives placed her baby boy on her breast , her first thought was , ' you did this to me			0
' @entity2 says the traumatic birth , which she was forced to endure with no anaesthetic , left her exhausted and begging for a @entity17			1
she was given an episiotomy and eventually gave birth to @entity20 with no pain relief			1
the experience - which @entity2 herself describes as ' horrific ' - not only left her shattered emotionally and physically - but left her terrified of having sexual relations with her husband			1
@entity2 's experience mirrors that of many women , who according to a new one @entity38 survey commissioned by this morning are fearful of sex following childbirth			1
results of the poll found that almost half of mums are so traumatised by childbirth that they delay having sex for four months			1
and of those women who do struggle to reignite their sex lives after giving birth , the poll , of 10,000 women , found that three quarters fail to talk to anyone about the problem			1
for @entity2 , the negative birth experience was impossible to shake off			1
' it was really , really bad , ' she told @entity57 and @entity58 on this morning			0
' i could n't have imagined it would be that bad			0
' i had a long labour - 36 hours - and i was begging for a c - section			1
i could n't have any anaestheic			0
to make matters worse , i also had retained product , episiotomy and lots of stitches			1
commonplace : dr @entity69 says more women than we might think suffer from sexual issues after childbirth - but they are too embarrassed to talk about it @entity2 says she was in ' lots of pain ' when she went back home - and while she expected the pain to get better with time , it actually worsened			1
' i was still in a lot of pain			2
i thought maybe the stitches were too tight , maybe this was supposed to happen			2
but the pain got gradually worse			2
and i did n't realise it at time - but i had signs of @entity24			1
' i grew away from @entity20 when i was supposed to be growing close to him			0
i looked at him in hospital and thought - what have you done to me ? ' at first , @entity2 did n't feel the same level of blame towards her husband			1
but further down the line , she says she began to fear rekindling her love life with her husband in case sex led to another pregnancy			2
' i got worried that if we had sex again it could happen			2
and i was worried about how much it would hurt , ' she says			0
this @entity104 's survey said half of mothers wait up to four months to have sex			1
before @entity2 tried , 14 months had passed			1
this @entity104 's residential expert dr @entity107 said @entity2 's fear was actually incredibly common			1
' you tick so many boxes - traumatic birth , pain , @entity24 - i would be more surprised if you had been having a very happy , healthy sex life early on , ' she said			1
' every woman after a vaginal delivery worries sex will hurt			2
and there 's a deeper psychology there that sex is what got you in this mess in the first place			2
fears : ' every woman after a vaginal delivery worries sex will hurt , ' says dr @entity69			2
' and there 's a deeper psychology there that sex is what got you in this mess in the first place ' ' as a first time mother who had a traumatic delivery there is an element of shock			2
plus sleepless nights - bed becomes for sleeping in			2
' dr @entity69 says many women do not think about intercourse until the six week check			0
' we always start talking about contraception at that point , ' she says			0
' depending what surveys you look at , about one in 20 wo n't have sex within six months			1
most are back within a year - but @entity2 had a lot to contend with			1
' eventually , after 14 months @entity2 's sex life was brought back on track			1
' at five months i had counselling for @entity24 and we did talk about sex , but i still did n't feel comfortable with it			1
' after 14 months , i tried again - easing myself into it			1
i ended up pregnant again			0
it was probably a good thing			0
if it had had to be planned , i do n't think there would have been a second			0
' because of my previous experience , i did n't believe it			0
i took about 30 tests until a friend said , " you 're pregnant			0
buy some folic acid "			0
' the second birth was better than the first ; @entity2 describes it as ' okay '			1
' i decided early on i wanted an epidural , ' she says			0
i had @entity171 , and i looked at her and thought , " oh lovely " - it was how i thought i would have felt the first time			2
but the good fortune was not to last			0
a few days after giving birth and while she was still in hospital , @entity171 realised she was incontinent			1
' my waterworks were not working at all			0
if i coughed , i wet myself			0
if i stood up , it would flood			0
the hospital said i could go home , but i knew something was n't right			0
i was incontinent until a year later , when i had an operation			2
@entity2 also suffered a uterus prolapse			1
' there was so much swelling i was constantly uncomfortable , ' she says			0
' i had a lot of pelvic pain			2
' by this point , sex was entirely off the agenda and @entity2 's husband @entity190 was feeling desperate			1
' as a wife , did you have in your head , " i need to be a wife again " , asked @entity57			0
' did you have those worries ? did you fear he would look elsewhere ? ' ' @entity190 would instigate sex and i 'd say no , ' @entity2 confessed			1
' i could n't kiss and cuddle because i knew he 'd want to go further			0
my self - esteem was so low			0
i felt i smelled of urine the whole time			0
' @entity2 finally managed to have sex again after 20 months			1
but while @entity2 feared that she was alone in her suffering , dr @entity69 says such issues are far more commonplace than women realise			1
' @entity2 had a big baby and a traumatic , interventional delivery			2
the incontinence with the second baby was partly down to problems caused with the first baby			0
the stretching of the pelvic floor muscles caused the prolapse			0
' it 's something women do n't talk about , ' she says			0
' but i wish they did - they would realise they are not alone			0
