‘ they are not just grumpy shire @entity58 as some suggest			0
in fact , your typical @entity1 supporter is a working - class male from the @entity57			0
perhaps the most striking feature of @entity1 ’s support is just how male it is			0
‘ you do n’t win back voters like this by simple positioning on immigration and @entity115			0
