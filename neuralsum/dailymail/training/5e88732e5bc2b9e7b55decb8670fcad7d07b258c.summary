but i do believe in paying for a good outcome			0
we ’re paying for @entity4 but we ’re getting @entity6			1
’ last year , 481 @entity1 staff were paid £ 1million or more , up from 428 in 2012 , while investment bankers received average bonuses of £ 60,100			1

sir @entity77 , chairman of @entity1 ’ remuneration committee , was heckled by the meeting after asking miss @entity68 not to complain publicly			0
