@entity0 booted 24 points as @entity2 kept the pressure on @entity4 at the top of the @entity6 with a 39 - 16 victory over rivals @entity8			1
@entity9 was outstanding , landing six penalties and converting a penalty try and both of @entity13 's two touchdowns , as his side claimed their biggest - ever @entity6 win at @entity16			1
despite putting @entity2 under pressure at times , @entity8 could only record three penalties from scrum - half @entity21 's boot and a try from his replacement @entity25 , which was converted by fly - half @entity26			1
@entity2 fly half @entity0 fires over a penalty at @entity16 during his side 's 39 - 16 victory over @entity8 @entity2 arrived at @entity16 after a national newspaper report claimed that they are being investigated , along with @entity34 , for breaches of the @entity6 salary cap on saturday			1
nothing has been confirmed about the allegations , but it was not the ideal build - up to a big @entity42 derby clash for the men from the @entity44 @entity45 , @entity2 's biggest signing of the season , was on the bench for the derby after starting in the centre against @entity51 in the @entity52 seven days earlier			0
@entity2 replacement @entity13 crashes over for the first over his two tries against the @entity56 and , in front of a sell - out crowd , @entity8 were intent on adding to @entity2 's frustrations as they controlled the early territory but only had two @entity62 penalties in the opening 17 minutes to show for their dominance			1
@entity2 pulled themselves together and as they hassled @entity8 in midfield , mistakes saw @entity0 come to the fore			0
the @entity69 international was in wonderful form with his clinical goal - kicking , despite an unexpected simple handling error in the first - half that had the home fans cheering			0
@entity8 scrum half @entity21 kicked three penalties for the struggling home side it was intense stuff between the old rivals , with outstanding defence on both sides keeping their goal - lines unbroken			1
@entity9 and @entity26 tested the opposition under high balls on numerous occasions , looking for the mistake that could lead to a try , but when there was one @entity69 ace @entity89 was brought down close to the line after making a dart for the left corner			0
@entity8 had penalty attempts to get them back on terms but both @entity21 and centre @entity96 missed the posts , before the @entity100 scrum - half finally landed a third goal when @entity102 was penalised at a set - piece			0
@entity2 winger @entity104 ( right ) is tackled by @entity8 winger @entity105 however , it was @entity0 who was the keystone of the half , hitting the @entity56 for 15 points before the break via five penalties - most of which were from medium to long range			1
@entity8 started the second half on the front foot - a mirror image of the first period - as they developed countless phases inside @entity2 territory , but again @entity2 's outstanding defence was rock solid and turned the ball over to clear the danger			2
@entity9 made it six penalties when replacement loose - head prop @entity125 took a scrum down on his own 22 and , suddenly , @entity8 were nine points down and in desperate need of a converted try			0
but , after replacement tight - head @entity131 , who was sent off in the ugly affair between the two teams last april , was sin - binned for taking down a scrum , @entity2 powered their way to the line			0
@entity45 was named on the bench for the @entity8 match but saw some action at @entity16 @entity8 took down the maul and referee @entity141 went under the posts to award a penalty try			0
again @entity2 's tremendously organised defence would not be breached as @entity8 again powered within the visitor 's 22			2
but when @entity13 got @entity2 's second try , moments before @entity45 came on in place of @entity69 wing @entity150 , it was all over for @entity8			2
finally , @entity8 breached the @entity2 line as @entity25 stormed in from 22 metres , with @entity26 converting , but it was too little too late as @entity13 got a second converted try in the last move of the match .			2

@entity2 fly half @entity0 kicked 24 points for his side
the visitors scored though @entity13 ( two ) and a penalty try
@entity21 kicked three penalties for @entity8
the @entity56 could only *muster* one try through @entity25
@entity4 stay top of the @entity6 despite @entity2 's win
