the @entity1 will continue to honour @entity3 ’s huge debts even if it votes for independence , the @entity0 said yesterday			1
in a surprise intervention , treasury chief secretary @entity5 said the move was essential to prevent investors being spooked by the independence referendum and charging a ' separation surcharge ' for lending to the @entity1			1
it follows concerns over debt being transferred to a newly - independent country with no credit history			0
the @entity0 denied that @entity16 was letting @entity3 ‘ off the hook ’			2
first minister @entity18 has insisted he will only take on a share of the @entity1 's debt if an independent @entity3 can keep the pound it said an independent @entity3 would inherit a ‘ fair and proportionate ’ share of the @entity1 ’s £ 1.4trillion debt and would still be required to pay the money back			1
but @entity3 ’s first minister @entity18 hailed the move as a victory , which he said made a mockery of the government ’s claims that an independent @entity3 would be barred from keeping the pound			1
some @entity32 questioned whether the deal was fair on @entity35 voters			0
mp @entity36 warned it would fuel resentment about ‘ preferential ’ treatment for the @entity3			0
a spokesman insisted the move was designed to provide reassurance to investors looking to buy gilts , or government debt , this year			0
it was feared that global investors would turn their back on the @entity1 if there was uncertainty about who would take responsibility for the repaying the debt if @entity3 became an independent country			2
the @entity0 paper published today said : ‘ in the event of @entity3 independence from the @entity1 , the continuing @entity57 would in all circumstances honour the contractual terms of the debt issued by the @entity57			1
‘ an independent @entity3 state would become responsible for a fair and proportionate share of the @entity1 's current liabilities			2
’ treasury minister @entity5 said the move was designed to provide certainty to the bond markets however gilts sold by the @entity1 would not be transferred , instead an independent @entity3 ‘ would need to raise funds in order to reimburse the continuing @entity1 for this share ’			1
treasury secretary @entity5 , who is an mp in @entity3 , said the @entity1 @entity57 's new position should reassure the financial markets			1
‘ we want to make sure people who lend us money continue to do so at very low interest rates , ’ he told @entity74			0
‘ everybody knows that an independent @entity3 would be likely to face considerably higher interest rates , less credibility in the international finance markets			0
‘ what we want to avoid is any sort of idea that the rest of the @entity1 - taxpayers across the whole of the @entity1 , including in @entity3 between now and in september - pay any sort of separation surcharge , an extra cost on debt that causes uncertainty in the financial markets			1
‘ but an independent @entity3 would still be required to take its fare share of the debt , were @entity3 to vote to separate from the rest of the @entity1			1
’ the pro-independence campaign seized on the announcement as proof it was setting the agenda and would demand a currency union – allowing @entity3 to continue using the pound – in return for accepting a share of the debt			2
@entity1 ministers have so far refused publicly to ‘ pre-negotiate ’ terms of independence for @entity3			0
but mr @entity18 said the decision by the @entity0 shows that @entity1 ministers are coming to terms with ‘ reality ’			1
he added : ‘ these documents make clear that we remain prepared to negotiate taking responsibility for financing a fair share of the debts of the @entity1 provided , of course , @entity3 secures a fair share of the assets , including the monetary assets			2
‘ any market uncertainty in the gilts market has been caused by their own refusal to discuss the terms of independence before the referendum and it is their own insistence that @entity3 would be a new state that lands them with the unambiguous legal title to the accumulated debts of the @entity1			0
‘ that position is now beyond argument and today 's announcement makes clear that @entity3 would be in an extremely strong negotiating position to secure that fair deal			0
’ voters in @entity3 will have their say on a referendum on independence on september 18 , 2014 he said opponents of independence must end the ‘ bluff and bluster ’ and ‘ listen to the overwhelming majority of the people of @entity151 who , polls indicate , see the common sense of sharing a common currency ’			0
however , @entity1 chancellor @entity155 has ruled out allowing an independent @entity3 to continue using the pound if voters choose to go it alone			2
the @entity158 set out two possible positions on debt sharing in its formal @entity161 on independence last november			0
it explored the historical balance of public spending and tax since 1980 , when figures became available , or a population - based share			0
it calculates a historical share of debt interest could be £ 3.9 billion in 2016 - 17 or £ 5.5 billion based on a per head share .			1

@entity0 guarantees all £ 1.4trillion in debt over fear of interest rise
move to reassure bond markets about who will repay what the @entity1 owes
