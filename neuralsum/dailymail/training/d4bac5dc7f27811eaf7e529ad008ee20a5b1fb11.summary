a series of disturbing new allegations emerged today that added further weight to claims @entity5 rebels looted the @entity7 crash scene to sabotage the investigation and cash in on the disaster			1
in the first , desperate relatives revealed how they had called the mobile phones of their loves ones - only for them to be answered by strangers with ' eastern @entity16 - sounding voices '			1
after the initial shock , they immediately called the phone companies to shut down the accounts to prevent them being used , according to reports			2
new evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes			1
@entity59 intelligence chiefs claim they have uncovered evidence the insurgents also discussed removing bodies from the area and sending the black box data recorders to @entity65 , according to @entity67 sources in @entity68			1
@entity69 , @entity67 's defence correspondent , said : ' i think this will play into the fears that many people have that not all of the bodies will be returned , that parts of the plane have been tampered with in order to try and hide any evidence			1
a toy belonging to a child who died in the downed @entity26 flight @entity7 is pictured in a field near the village of @entity30 , in the @entity32 region belongings of victims are pictured at the crash site of the @entity89 in a field near @entity30 toys in a bag are pictured at the crash site of the @entity26 flight @entity7 , in a field near the village of @entity30 , in the @entity32 region ' this is all a part of @entity59 intelligence working with intelligence agencies around the world to try and build up a picture not only of what happened at the point of impact , but also what happened in the hours and days that followed on from that			1
' meanwhile , an alleged decree by rebel commander @entity108 appears to admit that the bodies of dead passengers were looted by @entity5 rebels			1
evidence of looting ? the image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage @entity118 for clues ? a rebel fighter is filmed rifling through the bag of one of the 298 @entity7 crash victims the order says that jewellery , watches and other valuables taken from bodies must be handed in to the ' defence fund ' of the self - proclaimed @entity131 by 8pm on wednesday 23 july			1
styled like other orders from @entity108 , its veracity could not be immediately established			0
but if true , it will be seen as scandalous that the rebels are cashing in on the dead victims of the @entity139 plane widely believed to have been shot down by the same @entity141 separatists			1
rather than ordering any looted possessions to be returned to the families , it demands they are taken to @entity108 's headquarters so they can be used to fund the insurgency campaign he is conducting			2

' before 8 pm on 23 july 2014 you must give these things away to the headquarters of @entity131 army			0
valuable items ( watches , earrings , lockets and other jewellery ) must be sent to the @entity158			0
' it is signed by rebel army commander colonel @entity108 , and carries what appears to be an official stamp			1
the alleged order has been posted on social media websites in @entity190 and @entity165			0
if true , it would confirm claims by @entity194 officials that the bodies were looted			0
children walk past a piece of wreckage from the @entity7			0
military analysts said the size , spread , shape and number of shrapnel impacts visible all point to a missile system like the @entity207 as previously suspected @entity208 , sad journey home : @entity37 police watch as a plane touches down carrying the bodies of crash victims from @entity26 flight @entity7 at @entity215 at least one picture has emerged which appeared to show a ring being taken by a rebel from a body at the crash site			1
a @entity190 government advisor @entity222 has claimed : ' after terrorists looters stole all the cash , jewellery , mobile phones and credit cards of passengers of ill - fated @entity167 - they took up their favourite deal - gathering of scrap metal			1
aluminum from which made the plane is expensive			0
' two days ago , @entity234 , spokesman for @entity190 's @entity235 and @entity236 , claimed : ' the cynicism of these gangsters has no limits			0
' according to our information , apart from picking up valuable personal belongings of the passengers , terrorists are using credit cards of the victims			2
' contaminating the crime scene : a pro-russian militant holds up a stuffed animal as others look on at the @entity7 crash site which they have been accused of sabotaging in an attempt to hamper the investigation however , it is unclear that relatives have complained about this , a point the @entity165 media has made strongly in alleging these are slurs from the @entity190 side			2
' @entity222 said in an interview that he had information that the rebels were cashing the victims credit cards			1
no complaints from relatives or bank records were produced , of course , ' said a commentary from @entity273 news agency in @entity65			0
@entity108 is alleged by @entity194 to be a serving colonel in @entity165 's @entity276 military intelligence			2
he is accused of fomenting unrest in eastern @entity190 , and was earlier based in @entity278 when the @entity280 peninsula was annexed by @entity165			0
his ' order ' is revealed on the day when the first bodies are scheduled to arrive back in @entity47			0
@entity165 ' bears responsibility ' for the downing of @entity287 17 , @entity284 intelligence officials said , but they offered no evidence that @entity289 was directly involved			1
the senior intelligence officials were cautious in their assessment , noting that while the @entity165 have been arming separatists in eastern @entity190 , the @entity284 had no direct evidence that the missile used to shoot down the passenger jet came from @entity165			1
the plane was probably shot down by an @entity207 surface - to - air missile fired by @entity165 - backed separatists in eastern @entity190 , the intelligence officials said			2
@entity284 intelligence chiefs have found no evidence of @entity289 's direct involvement in the shooting down of @entity7 but said @entity165 ' bears responsibility ' for the disaster they also said that after analysing taped phone conversations between separatists obtained by @entity284 intelligence it could be all but concluded that the culprits did not realise they were targeting a commercial airliner			1
' five days into it [ following the crash ] it does appear to be a mistake , ' one official said			0
the officials briefed reporters over intelligence related to last week 's air disaster , which killed 298 people			2
it comes a day after the first pictures emerged of damaged panels from @entity7 , which appear to show evidence of shrapnel and missile damage			2
they cited intercepts , satellite photos and social media postings by separatists , some of which have been authenticated by @entity284 experts			2
separatists previously had shot down 12 @entity190 military airplanes , the officials said but the officials said they did not know who fired the missile or whether any @entity165 operatives were present at the missile launch			0
they were not certain that the missile crew was trained in @entity165 , although they described a stepped - up campaign in recent weeks by @entity165 to arm and train the rebels , which they say has continued even after the downing of the commercial jetliner			0
in terms of who fired the missile , ' we do n't know a name , we do n't know a rank and we 're not even 100 % sure of a nationality , ' one official said			0
@entity354 deputy national security adviser @entity353 said the @entity284 was still working to determine whether the missile launch had a ' direct link ' to @entity165 , including whether there were @entity165 on the ground during the attack and the degree to which @entity165 may have trained the separatists to launch such a strike			0
' we do think president @entity289 and the @entity165 government bears responsibility for the support they provided to these separatists , the arms they provided to these separatists , the training they provided as well and the general unstable environment in eastern @entity190 , ' he said in an interview with @entity375			0
he added that heavy weaponry continues to flow into @entity190 from @entity165 following the downing of the plane .			0
