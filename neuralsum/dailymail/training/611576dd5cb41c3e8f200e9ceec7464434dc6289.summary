with its chipped green paint and down - at - heel panelling , the entrance to @entity3 's @entity2 temple looks nothing short of innocuous			1
but in @entity2 , nothing is quite what it seems - and ms @entity8 , 67 , is certainly no ordinary pensioner			1
for within her simple looking temple , 200 - year - old voodoo rituals are still performed , bringing devotees from all over the world to her door			1
ancient traditions : surrounded by artefacts and gifts , 67 - year - old @entity3 conducts a ritual in the back - room of the @entity20 , where voodoo rites dating back to their @entity23 origins are rigorously preserved but , as ms @entity8 explains , voodoo is n't quite as black as it 's painted and she 's at pains to point out that dark rituals and animal sacrifice play no part in her repertoire			1
instead , the entrance to the temple boasts a welcoming assortment of carvings , masques , beads while copies of the @entity36 fill a small back room , heavy with the scent of incense and candle wax			1
‘ the unseen will always have a way to come to the light , ’ she explains , gesturing towards her collection of curios – some of them gifts to the voodoo deities			1
‘ if you do n’t try and bring it yourself it has a way to press towards you			1
a lot of things in this room are like that			1
’ welcome : the temple - backdrop for many of her rituals - is filled with statues , masks and framed pictures , but there is little evidence of the clichés commonly associated with voodoo practice ' i never question why people leave it ' : dollar bills , gifts to the voodoo deities , are scattered across every surface , while others are rolled like handmade cigarettes there ’s also money – and plenty of it ; crisp dollar bills layer every flat surface , while some are rolled like home - made cigarettes and pushed between the carved lips of mounted @entity23 masks			1
‘ i would have taken it out but it ’s done so uniquely , ’ she remarks with a wry smile			2
‘ i never question why people leave it			2
chillingly , she adds : ' death has a way to accumulate here			2
there ’s a story for everything in this room			2
’ nevertheless , easing herself into a chair , she ’s keen to dispel the myths and clichés commonly associated with voodoo			1
‘ it ’s funny that someone would walk around playing the fantasy game of voodoo practitioner , dressed like a made up mannequin , ’ she says with a laugh			1
‘ people say “ well in @entity112 they wore white , ” but it ’s simple – in those days women did n’t have much clothing to choose from			2
’ to illustrate her point , she shows off a flowing gown decorated with a vibrant blue and burnt orange coral pattern , balanced with splotches of black			2
but while the wardrobe has clearly changed , voodoo traditions remain true to their 18th century origins			1
‘ they would not have said they were having a voodoo ritual , ' says ms @entity8 of the early voodoo practitioners			1
' rather , they were using their early knowledge attained in @entity112 ; their wisdom , their wits			2
they were using every principle and insight they had to survive			2
they were using the principles of knowledge they had learned over many years			2
‘ that knowledge lasts a long time when you are in dire conditions			2
you ca n’t scream for someone to take you to hospital because there is no hospital			2
the hospital is at your feet – the bush			2
’ offerings : the @entity20 is a veritable treasure trove of seemingly disparate items			1
according to @entity160 ‘ the unseen will always have a way to come to the light			2
if you do n’t try and bring it yourself it has a way to press towards you			2
a lot of things in this room are like that ’ born @entity162 in bible belt @entity163 , ms @entity8 says her first mystical experience took place at the age of 15 , prompted by a fierce rainstorm that swept across her rural homestead while her mother was at church			1
‘ it was like something was hitting on the windows , ’ she recalls			0
‘ i told my younger sister to form a circle with me and i cried “ @entity177 let your @entity178 come down ! ” ‘ that was my first ceremony , and all of a sudden it stopped			0
a child ’s prayer is worth all the weight of gold in @entity186			0
@entity187 hears a child quickly			0
’ moves to @entity190 and then @entity191 would follow , where work as an operating theatre nurse was combined with a dual role as an ordained bishop at the @entity196			1
@entity197 : elusive about her practices , princess @entity160 says she often helps people who are ‘ at the bottom of their own will			0
you give them some prayer , you give them their mojo back , you give them something they can feel ' it was here , she says , that she met late husband @entity214 , with whom she would move south to @entity215 in 1990 , founding the @entity20 shortly before his death in 1995			1
‘ we came to @entity2 with six dollars in our pocket			1
‘ we had the voodoo museum at @entity221 and then in march ’ 94 , we moved to this place			1
' @entity223 ’ 95 on march 6 he passed			0
we did his funeral right here in this room with his casket			0
when we received his death certificate , it said 8:28 in the morning was his passing and this store here is 8 - 28 @entity233 , and that door opened in april the next month after he passed			1
@entity235 does n’t surprise you , it rises			0
’ the temple has since been predominantly used for spiritual purposes but while she remains coy about the rituals conducted in her back room , she admits they are often sought by those in dire physical and emotional straits			1
imposing : the carved sculpture of a @entity23 doctor , the rim of his hat layered with dollar bills , is one of many icons on show in the @entity20 ‘ there are some people who are at the bottom of their own will , ’ she says			1
‘ you give them some prayer , you give them their mojo back , you give them something they can feel			0
‘ every time you are angry or depressed you put a dark cloud on your organs and they begin to deteriorate			0
' when people get better acquainted with their own bodies they can have resolve with them , and make them less of a problem than they come to be			0
‘ life does not promise to give you a better deal			0
you just keep shining on the surface because that ’s what people like			0
’ others come to ms @entity8 for comparatively superficial reasons			1
’ they ca n’t take failure , ’ she says with a shrug			0
‘ they ’re so enchanted			0
sometimes people are n’t thinking about emotional wellbeing			0
they ’re looking for a quick fix so they do n’t have to think about very much			0
' there are some people who just want you to push a button so this character they ’re so fixated with will just materialise			0
offerings : piles of money layer various surfaces ( @entity297 ) while bottles , cups and cans of foodstuff join an array of beads , statues and assorted items on the back - room floor ( r ) ‘ you need to have courage and insight to apply practices to yourself instead of finding things to glue onto you , because glue comes apart , ' she continues			0
' i like to talk like this because experiences bring you here , and if you have no experience you ’re just going to believe in hearsay			0
i believe the divine energy brought me here			0
’ while many seek spiritual well - being through prayer to the voodoo deities , the room also serves as a place of celebration – and remembrance			1
‘ visitors come here from all over the world and they want to come and see what they have heard , ' she says			1
' there are so many different ways that this room is used or presented to people			0
colourful : @entity160 dispelled some of the misconceptions related to her practice , amongst them the common belief that voodoo practitioners ' always wear white robes ' ‘ i do n’t just deal with human crisis – that would be boring			1
i do weddings in this room , i do funerals			0
there ’s a lot of shields on my shoulder			0
‘ for now ms @entity8 is looking ahead to 2015 , when she celebrates the 33rd anniversary of her ordination as a spiritual bishop – and the @entity354 return of a certain @entity356 drama			1
‘ @entity358 ! i ca n't wait for january			0
and @entity359 ? i love mysteries ! @entity361 , you can always bring me some of her			0
my favourite is the @entity363			0
‘ i like to let people know i ’ve been somewhere in my head before they find me			0
