regional favourites like @entity10 , @entity12 sausages and black pudding are unknown to many youngsters in the @entity15 - with newer staples like curry and stir fries proving more popular			2
and some of the seafood ' delicacies ' loved by our grandparents are completely misunderstood			0
@entity24 's innards ? @entity25 : nine in ten @entity15 children have never heard of that most @entity28 dish , the haggis researchers have found more than half of @entity15 children ( 58 per cent ) have never eaten a @entity34 pasty , while three out of four kids have never tried a @entity37 cream tea			1
experts fear for the future of traditional regional food as nine out of 10 youngsters have never tried haggis , while more than a third of @entity15 children has not experienced candyfloss			1

waffles source : @entity58 the ' flavours of @entity2 ' survey of 1,000 children by hotel chain @entity58 also revealed two - thirds of them have never tasted a stick of rock			2

food historian @entity143 said : ' looking at this research , it is a great pity that so many young @entity15 are not aware of , or have not had the opportunity to enjoy , our rich and varied regional culinary heritage			0
the new wave : dishes such as chicken tikka masala are more likely to feature on children 's food wish lists ' many modern @entity15 appear reluctant to try the great range of regional dishes this country has to offer yet they are very open to international cuisine			2
' in my experience , once people have tried these regional dishes they are pleasantly surprised at how tasty they are			0
' many regional dishes give us insights into the cooking of much earlier times and it would be a great shame to lose this culinary heritage			0
' i would strongly encourage parents and their children to seek out and try these dishes for themselves in order to help preserve our food heritage for future generations			0
if not , we could lose both a great source of enjoyment and a very valuable part of our culinary history			0
' @entity58 spokeswoman @entity180 said : " food is a big part of @entity2 's rich heritage			0
' however , our research has highlighted that we are at risk of losing some of our famous regional dishes because children have not been given the opportunity or encouraged to try them			0
