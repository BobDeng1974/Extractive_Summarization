beautiful women and handsome men dance around a set of @entity3 in their flexible yet stylish @entity5 macs , accompanied by guardsmen in bearskins and an angelic boy who just happens to be @entity9 , probably the only famous 12 - year - old in @entity11			1
little expense has been spared in the @entity14 advert			0
and why not ? the brand has unquestionably become @entity11 ’s premier luxury label , its only superbrand			1
with its designer @entity18 at the helm as ceo , @entity5 is @entity3 's answer to @entity22			1
its fashion shows have become the biggest , starriest event at @entity3 fashion week			1
even in a weakening market for luxury goods , revenues rose seven per cent in the past six months to more than £ 1 billion			2
@entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 are among the stars who wear @entity5 — the deluxe , catwalk @entity5 line , the rainwear and bags			1
in the current advert , @entity9 wears the £ 315 ‘ icon ’ cashmere scarf in @entity5 ’s distinctive camel , black , white and red check			1
hard to believe that it was only a decade ago that the brand seemed in crisis and that check was less icon , more albatross			1
@entity61 too widespread for its own good , it had become known as ‘ chav check ’			1
immediately recognisable — and affordable , on items such as a £ 50 baseball cap — it was accessible luxury that became far too accessible			1
worse still , it was easy to copy and spawned an industry of counterfeits			0
real or fake , it was on everything from bikinis to bags , favoured by football hooligans and — most spectacularly — worn head to toe ( including toddler and buggy ) by @entity80 actress @entity38 in 2002			2
following in her footsteps : @entity9 is making waves in the fashion world , just like his mother , @entity85 magic dust : plenty of it is being sprinkled on @entity5 whose shares are on the up it is hard to remember another single photograph doing a brand so much damage			1
in the words of social commentator @entity97 , author of the @entity98 : ‘ it was associated with people who did bad stuff , who went wild on the terraces			0
quite a lot of people thought that @entity5 would be worn by the person who mugged them			1
’ some venues banned anyone wearing it , so entrenched was its association with anti-social behaviour			0
it had come a very long way from its respectable beginnings yet how ironic it is that the brand ’s slow limp back to respectability has been matched , step - for - step by the very family whose pint - sized representative is being seen as a symbol of salvation			1
not so long ago @entity9 ’s mother @entity85 , although not viewed with quite as much derision as @entity38 , was far from being a fashion icon			2
a wag and popstar known for her fake tan , fake breasts and fake hair extensions she was the very sort of person @entity5 did n’t want to wear its merchandise			1
golden touch : it 's thanks to @entity138 , centre , that stars like @entity140 , left , and @entity141 are keen to be seen in @entity5 now named @entity11 ’s top entrepreneur , with a style that ’s more vogue than football terrace , the choice of her son to front the @entity143 campaign is fitting indeed			1
the brand was founded by @entity152 , teetotaller and devout baptist , in 1856			2
he went on to invent gabardine , the waterproof fabric that revolutionised rainwear			0
@entity158 went to the @entity159 and @entity160 to @entity161 , in @entity5			1
then the @entity164 commissioned the company to design the ‘ trench coat ’ , worn by officers in @entity168 in an early case of celebrity endorsement , lord @entity162 declared himself a fan and civilians started wearing them after the war			0
@entity5 made aviation - wear and skiwear but remained a quiet @entity3 firm until @entity178 , an @entity179 executive , took over in 1997			1
she raised its profile , expanded into @entity179 , commissioned an advertising campaign starring @entity182 in 1999 and , most significantly of all , hired @entity18 on the design team in 2001			0
approved by style icons : @entity185 of @entity186 , left , and @entity42 in @entity5 coats by now it was at the height of its ‘ chav ’ popularity , most pertinently illustrated by the @entity38 overload			1
the brand had become a victim of its own success			2
in luxury , ubiquity is the death knell ; luxury is exclusive or it is n’t luxury at all			2
the idea of anyone being able to resuscitate that check into anything remotely desirable seemed as likely as @entity5 opening a shop on the moon			1
it was vulgar , vulgar , vulgar			0
but the firm refused to admit defeat			0
steps were taken to stop the rot — the caps went out of production , and the use of check was reduced across the board			1
in 2004 @entity18 was promoted to @entity217			0
@entity5 was becoming a more serious player			1
in 2006 , a turning point came in the form of another @entity179 ceo with an impressive cv , @entity223			0
she arrived and , together with @entity18 , performed the remarkable feat of carving out a strategy to move @entity5 firmly back off the backs of the undesirables into the ‘ hot ’ zone , using a combination of design skill , marketing savvy and business sense			1
even now , the fashion set are still in awe of how they turned things round			0
one leading magazine editor told me : ‘ it ’s very hard to know quite how @entity18 does it			0
he runs a design team , a huge company — most fashion brands are like that — and he edits it all			2
‘ like @entity246 , for whom he worked at @entity247 , he knows the importance of being on message and on brand			2
the shows bang one point home again and again — 70 girls wearing the same thing			1
it ’s about one big idea			0
plus , the models are acceptably , immediately appealing , like the music he chooses			0
he ’s really good at marketing			0
’ star - studded front row : the @entity5 show is the must - see event at @entity264 the answer seems to lie in the fusion of design and business strategy			1
in the bad old days , due to complicated global licensing , different stores in the world sold a whole load of different products , at different prices , adding up to what @entity223 called ‘ just a lot of stuff ’			0
companies she admired such as @entity280 and @entity281 ( where she is now a senior vice president ) offered the same experience in any store			0
she decided to ‘ centralise the design ’ under @entity18 , who became chief creative officer in 2009			2
from then on every single design decision was to be approved by him			0
this ‘ control freak ’ philosophy meant that the @entity290 - ish figure of @entity18 could prevail in all areas of his fabulous fashion factory			0
son of a carpenter and an @entity296 window dresser , @entity18 is a famously polite , softly - spoken @entity297 with an iron will and a sharp sense for the vagaries of fashion , in fabrics , hemlines , or mood			0
after his promotion , every new @entity5 shop offered the same stock , at the same price			1
the store design — mirrors , warm wood , videos — was uniform			2
he decided to concentrate on the brand ’s heritage , or the good bits , anyway			2
the check was further reduced			2
@entity5 would do what it did best : trench coats			1
they would also come home			0
the company moved its fashion shows back to @entity3 from @entity323 in 2009 and became a giant fish in a smaller pond , a move that gave it a clearer identity and more publicity			1
but vitally , there were two more strands to the brand ’s resurgence			2
@entity334 innovation , and wearability			0
models , from left , @entity338 , @entity339 and @entity340 have raised the brand 's profile @entity18 has the golden gift of knowing just what will take off on the streets , and spreads the word			1
it was n’t just that they were the first brand to live - stream their fashion shows in 2010 , or to let customers order from the runway , or to garner followers on social media			1
it was that they deliberately targeted what @entity223 called ‘ millennials ’ — young customers — because they believed their competitors were ignoring them			2
the youth drive was important because in emerging markets such as @entity368 , the age of the luxury goods consumer is much lower than it is in the @entity11			1
but it had a happy side - effect			0
rather than alienating the older , more traditional customer in the @entity373 , it ensured they perceived the brand as edgy and exciting			2
a @entity5 gabardine jacket was worn by @entity377 on his ill - fated attempt on @entity379 in 1924 one of the many mysteries of fashion is that you would think an expensive luxury brand , which wants to sell to the highly lucrative 40 and 50 - something market , would make sure that it offers clothes that are not too short , or too revealing			1
bafflingly , most designer fashion labels miss this obvious fact			0
but part of @entity18 ’s brilliance was that while there was always enough edge — sharp leather jackets , buckles , trims , glimmery fabric — his clothes did n’t frighten the horses			0
like @entity399 ’s designs for @entity22 , @entity5 offered high fashion that almost any middle - class , middle - aged woman could wear			1
they never neglected the core customer — in @entity3 , a busy , affluent 30 to 60 - year - old woman or man			0
expansion continued apace , more stores opened with well - trained staff ; online sold bespoke trench coats in endless varieties ; @entity413 was launched			0
this year , as @entity223 departed for @entity281 , @entity18 became ceo as well as chief creative officer			0
his first @entity14 advert seems sure - footed and accessible			0
it a sign of @entity18 ’s supreme confidence that even the once - dreaded check is back in the game			2
no wonder @entity9 is dancing			0
he represents sweet victory after a chequered history .			0

the brand has unquestionably become @entity11 's premier luxury label
its shows have become the starriest event at @entity264
back in 2009 , shares hovered below 600p — now they are around 1,400p
@entity40 and @entity42 among the stars who wear @entity5
but only a decade ago , distinctive designs were known as ' chav check '
