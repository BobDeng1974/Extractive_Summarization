at a @entity3 high school graduation , the valedictorian 's speech began as planned but suddenly became a religious sermon in spite of his school district ’s recent ban of prayers at school gatherings			1
@entity12 , the top graduate of @entity13 , @entity3 ’s @entity11 submitted one speech for approval prior to the recent ceremony , but ended up tearing it up before a shocked crowd and giving an altogether different address			1
but it was n’t entirely impromptu			1
' obviously i did n't do my job well enough , ' @entity12 said after telling the crowd his speech had been approved by faculty			0
' we 're going to have to use a different one			0
who cares ? ' then he ripped his speech in two			0
@entity28 ... imbued : valedictorian @entity12 tore up his speech and chose to address the crowd with the @entity30 ‘ those that we look up to , they have helped carve and mold us into the young adults that we are today , ’ he began again			1
‘ i ’m so glad that both of my parents led me to the lord at a young age			0
and i think most of you will understand when i say … ’ @entity12 paused , threw caution to the wind and began reciting a speech his audience had likely heard before			0
‘ @entity30 , who art in @entity44 , hallowed be thy name … ’ @entity12 ’s approved convocation address suddenly sounded a whole lot like the @entity30			2
@entity12 continued as the crowd ’s initial spattering of applause became a roar : ‘ lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil			2
’ spirited : the crowd was shocked as @entity12 shredded his approved speech , but the shock soon turned to applause ‘ you could n't even hear him doing the prayer anymore because everybody was clapping and cheering , ’ attendee @entity59 told @entity60			1
but @entity12 pressed on , righteously pointing a finger in the air as he struggled to be heard over the crowd			0
‘ for @entity66 is the @entity67 and the power and the glory , forever and ever … amen			0
’ the teenager ’s zeal may have stemmed from the school district ’s new rule banning prayers that reference specific religion in gatherings including school board meetings and , presumably , graduations			1
the rule has caused a stir in the southern jurisdiction , as it was widely perceived as a ‘ ban on prayer in schools			1
’ misconception ? @entity12 went rogue , apparently as a reaction to new county rules barring ' sectarian ' from school gatherings , a rule widely misconstrued as an explicit ban on prayer in the @entity3 county 's schools @entity94 superintendent @entity93 clarified the rule in a march blog post : ‘ what i find unfortunate are the mistaken and false representations that the @entity98 want to “ ban ” prayer from our schools , ’ she writes			1
‘ the difference between the @entity98 taking unto itself an invocation that previously was given by invitation , and some sort of wholesale anti-religious campaign , is vast			0
’ despite going rogue in the face of the county ’s decision , @entity12 wo n’t be facing any disciplinary action			2
according to a school publication , @entity113 reports , @entity12 will be pursuing a bachelor ’s degree at nearby @entity116 in the fall and wants to go on to be a ‘ computer programmer overseas			2

@entity120 went rogue in *violation* of his @entity3 high school 's ban on ' sectarian ' prayer at school gatherings by turning his commencement address into an impromptu sermon , to huge applause
