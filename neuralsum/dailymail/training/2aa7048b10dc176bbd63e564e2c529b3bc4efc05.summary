thousands of people have once again leveled contempt at polarizing @entity4 cheerleader @entity2 over an online competition she set up to find the ' hottest ' male hunter			1
the 19 - year - old - who has been bombarded with death threats and hate from all over the world due to her proud @entity12 posts about killing rare and exotic animals - said that she received over 3,000 submissions for the contest and personally decided upon an ' @entity16 - style @entity17 '			1
but it was n't the nominees or even the winner - @entity21 's @entity20 - that people cared about , and rather the fact @entity24 was once again celebrating the slaughter of animals in the name of sport			1
' ( @entity30 ) for the day your gun fails and the lion tears u apart , ' one furious critic , @entity29 , posted to @entity24 ' facebook page			1
packing heat : @entity2 , 19 , has only further incensed her detractors by starting up a search for the hottest hunter ' sick and ignorant ' : critics say such a competition is nothing but a celebration of slaughtering animals for fun big game : most of the nominees are seen pictured with the rare animals they have shot dead winner : @entity20 , from @entity21 , was voted in as the winner of @entity53 2014 @entity2 wrote in announcing @entity20 as winner : ' @entity55 and good luck hunting in 2015 ! ! ' stiff competition : over 3,000 men are said to have applied to be part of the search fair game : while some animals are common for hunting , like deer , others are more exotic hot hunters : @entity24 later revealed her real inspiration for starting the contest @entity24 , a cheerleader at @entity70 , claims her motivation for initiating the competition was to expose the sexism she has suffered			1
' the real reason i did this whole competition was to prove that what really pisses off the anti-hunting crowd is not that i hunt , or that i pose with my trophies , or that i 'm proud of my achievements ... its the fact that i 'm a girl and i 'm doing those things , ' she wrote			2
' well i 'm here to tell you , i 'm never going to stop			0
' i 'm proud to hunt , proud to cheer , proud to wear makeup , and especially proud to be me ! ' however this seemed to only further infuriate her detractors			2
@entity12 user @entity92 wrote : ' let 's hunt you for your blonde locks they would look so much better on my head than yours ! ! ' @entity99 added : ' you may love your makeup but it does n't hide the monster you are			1
' @entity102 wrote : ' you are disgusting ! ' ' @entity16 - style ' : @entity24 narrowed nominees down to this @entity104 hate : scores of photos like this are being circulated online by critics of @entity24 , who they call a monster while many flared up against @entity24 , others , many of whom said they were hunters , took a more diplomatic approach			1
' i do n't care the slightest bit that you 're a women			0
i 'm just an average guy who cares about the fact that you 're just willing to kill an animal that just simply does n't need to be killed , ' wrote one man , @entity122			0
' i do understand that ppl r going to kill chickens , cows , and a few other things to keep our society flowing			0
i understand that hunting deer is acceptable			2
but do you really need to kill a lion / cheetah ? ' another man , @entity133 , took a similar approach , but was just as outraged			0
' i am a hunter have been since i could tote a @entity137 gun , ' he wrote			0
' i truly believe these people will have to answer to the man above for killing these beautiful creatures ...			0
. i was taught if you ai n't going to eat it , do n't shoot it , unless you are protecting yourself ...			0
. what warped pleasure would you get from killing these beautiful cats ? or an elephant , rhino ...			0
. etc ? ' @entity148 added : ' i do n't care that you hunt ... but do it because you 'll use the meat ... not for pure sport			2
you 're also killing endangered animals			2
you 're not a hunter ... you 're an idiot and a complete douche for enticing people and being antagonistic			0
' @entity24 has long maintained that she is careful to only hunt in areas where it is legal and many of her pictures have been taken on safari trips in @entity163			1
her and her family claim to give the meat from their kill to local villages			0
gone : @entity12 has also removed this image of her with an elephant			1
it said it removes ' content that promotes poaching of endangered species ... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse ' ' [ @entity178 ] was a hunter too , right ? he killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure			0
' yet , how can it be possible that someone can love the earth , and take from the @entity187 in the name of conservation ? for some folks , they 'll never understand			2
for the rest of us ... we were born that way			0
@entity195 , ' wrote @entity24			1
@entity24 , whose @entity12 indicates she ' is looking to host a tv show in january 2015 , ' said here is n't always space for threatened species like elephants or lions			1
' controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these , ' @entity24 writes			1
' funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property			2
' @entity215 5 : @entity24 says her first kill was a rare african white rhino , part of her quest to bag the @entity222 game animals ( rhino , elephant , @entity225 , leopard and lion ) legal : the young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she 's doing is fine , since she pays the governments of @entity222 countries to kill the animals @entity24 ' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras , hugging a dead leopard , and smiling beside elephants she had killed			1
one particular photo , in which she posed alongside an extremely endangered rhinoceros , had her critics especially steaming , but the @entity70 cheerleader says it was alive and well			2
' the vet drew blood , took dna samples , took body and head measurements , treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics			0
i felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the @entity261 population through conservation , ' she wrote			0
however , @entity24 has in her quest to bag the @entity222 game animals ( lion , elephant , @entity225 , leopard , and @entity268 / black rhinoceros ) shot a white rhino , which number around 20,000			1
because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist , some critics say @entity24 should be banned from hunting in @entity163 completely			1
pride : @entity24 learned how to hunt after she went with her father to @entity163 for his own hunts at age 9 ' cruelty ' : critics say she is not a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures boasts : ' this time i got my leopard , ' she wrote a safari when she was 14			2
' and also took down a hippo ' a second petition , this one on @entity296 and originating from @entity163 , is hoping to do just that			0
' @entity2 is an @entity299 born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting @entity222 wildlife under the facade of conservation , ' reads the petition			1
it continues : ' she has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless @entity222 animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms			1
' but she also has her supporters			0
a @entity12 account , @entity24 , has also started			1
' support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in @entity163 , ' reads the page			0

@entity2 has drawn the ire of thousands with her @entity12 photos showing her smiling alongside rare @entity222 beasts
contempt for the 19 - year - old @entity4 has *increased* over ' @entity326 '
detractors say competition celebrates slaughtering animals for sport
@entity12 already removed the ' @entity334 ' page because it represented a ' *credible* threat of *violence* '
@entity12 images of dead elephants , hippos and lions were also removed by the site for violating their standards
@entity24 , who hopes for a reality show , claims hunting is a conservation effort
