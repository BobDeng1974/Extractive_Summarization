by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:04 est , 5 december 2013 waste ? fish oil contains vitamin d taking vitamin d supplements in order to ward off illness could be a waste of time , a study shows			1
scientists saw little evidence that the pills lowered the risk of cancer , heart disease , stroke , @entity18 , @entity19 ’s or other diseases			1
for decades , scientists assumed that the mineral , one of the most popular supplements in @entity25 , had numerous health benefits			1
but a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults has concluded that a lack of vitamin d is not a trigger for many common illnesses			1
in @entity25 , the supplements market is worth £ 700million a year – a growth of 16 per cent in five years – and the most popular pills are multivitamins and fish oils , which contain vitamin @entity40 the main reason scientists thought vitamin d could protect against disease was that patients with cancer , heart disease or @entity18 ’s had very low levels of the nutrient			1
but the @entity51 researchers now suspect that , rather than vitamin d deficiency leading to disease , these illnesses stop the body from producing vitamin d , so sufferers have lower levels			1
lead author professor @entity59 , from the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity51 , said : ‘ what this discrepancy suggests is that decreases in vitamin d levels are a marker of deteriorating health			1
ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence			0
reduce vitamin d concentrations , which would explain why vitamin d deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders			2
’ but his study – published in @entity75 – did not cast doubt on the supplement ’s effect on the bones			2
the mineral is known to protect against bone thinning and the bone disorder rickets			2
two months ago the chief medical officer , dame @entity84 , called for free vitamins to be given to children after it emerged that a quarter of youngsters are short of vitamin @entity40 presently it is only available on prescription to under fives from low income families			0
in addition , pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin d tablet a day – which they can get on prescription – to ensure their baby ’s bones are healthy			0
other academics said more research was needed before vitamin d was discounted			0
professor @entity104 , honorary clinical professor of metabolic bone disease at @entity106 , said : ‘ one problem with this sort of systematic review is that it can only examine the studies which have been published previously , so it is limited by the level of vitamin d in subjects in these studies			0
more investigation : other academics said further research was needed before vitamin d was discounted ‘ it could very well be that the apparent negative results of this study have been obtained simply because they have not been looking at people with a sufficient degree of vitamin d insufficiency to have any meaningful biological effect			2
’ other recent studies have also cast doubt on the curative properties of vitamin d supplements			2
in one case , scientists found ‘ no convincing evidence ’ that vitamin d supplements would fend off a cold			1
testing was carried out on more than 300 adults in @entity134 over 18 months in 2010 and 2011			0
@entity135 were given extra vitamin d while the rest took placebo tablets			0
the vitamin d group caught 3.7 colds per person on average , compared with 3.8 colds per person for the placebo group			0
in october , a review of previous studies by @entity148 researchers claimed taking vitamin d supplements did not improve bone mineral density at the hip , spine , forearm or in the body as a whole			1
professor @entity156 , the study ’s leader , said : ‘ most healthy adults do not need vitamin d supplements			1
‘ our data suggest the targeting of low - dose vitamin d supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare			0
’ professor @entity156 reviewed 23 studies examining the effects of vitamin d supplements on bone density			0

for decades , scientists assumed that the mineral had many health benefits
study involving a million adults found deficiency does not cause illness
in @entity25 , the supplements market is worth £ 700million a year
