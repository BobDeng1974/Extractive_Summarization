by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 11:32 est , 7 march 2014 climate change will cause ‘ irreversible damage ’ to the @entity5 by 2030 unless immediate action is taken , marine scientists have warned			1
@entity7 ’s iconic heritage site is at a turning point , and coral will be destroyed ‘ for hundreds if not thousands of years ’ by hikes in carbon dioxide and the average global temperature , states a report published today			1
experts are calling for an ‘ increase in commitment ’ to lower carbon emissions to help protect the reef , which has already lost about half its coral coverage since the 1980s , with climate change fast becoming its main threat			2
at risk : scientists are warning that the @entity5 will be ' irreversibly damaged ' by 2030 unless the average global temperature is kept below the internationally agreed limit of @entity28 warming on pre-industrial levels , ‘ it is highly unlikely that coral reefs will survive ’ , according to @entity31 reef researcher @entity30 , co-author of the @entity33 report			1
he said current climate trends and a ' business as usual ' temperature increase of @entity37 would mean ‘ game over ’ for the @entity5			1
‘ even under the best - case scenario of @entity28 , corals disappear , ’ @entity30 told @entity39			2
‘ but with business as usual , it ’s game over			2
you look in the tank and the corals have died , bacteria have taken over , the sand has dissolved			0
‘ it ’s a very , very poor place			0
if you were to replicate that on the @entity5 , it would hardly be worthy of the word “ great ”			0
it simply wo n’t be a coral reef			2
’ and he called coral bleaching , which occurs when sea water temperatures becomes too warm and results in coral dying faster – a process unknown on the @entity5 before 1979 – a ‘ serious threat ’			0
dead coral : rising sea water temperatures cause coral to bleach and die faster ‘ if we do n't increase our commitment to solve the burgeoning stress from local and global sources , the reef will disappear , ’ he wrote in the foreword to the report , compiled by @entity67 as part of its @entity70 campaign			1
‘ this is not a hunch or alarmist rhetoric by green activists			0
it is the conclusion of the world 's most qualified coral reef experts			1
’ @entity30 said the @entity5 , which generates $ 6billion a year from tourism and supports 63,000 jobs , was at a turning point			2
‘ it is highly unlikely that coral reefs will survive more than a two degree increase in average global temperature relative to pre-industrial levels , ’ he said			1
‘ but if the current trajectory of carbon pollution levels continues unchecked , the world is on track for at least three degrees of warming			0
if we do n't act now , the climate change damage caused to our @entity5 by 2030 will be irreversible			0
’ dr @entity100 , co-author of the report , told the @entity102 : ‘ one of the most important functions of the reef is as a wave barrier			0
that protection will be lost			0
huge draw : the @entity5 generates $ 6billion in revenue from tourists every year ‘ without the reef , a lot of islands will be swamped			0
’ the @entity5 , one of the most biodiverse places on earth , teems with marine life and will be the focus of @entity7 's @entity70 - a global campaign which encourages people and organisations to switch off their lights for one hour on march 29 for climate change			1
the report comes as the reef , considered one of the most vulnerable places in the world to the impacts of climate change , is at risk of having its status downgraded by the @entity134 cultural organisation @entity133 to ‘ world heritage in danger ’			1
despite threats of a downgrade without action on rampant coastal development and water quality , @entity7 in december approved a massive coal port expansion in the region and associated dumping of dredged waste within the marine park 's boundaries .			1

@entity7 's iconic reef is at a ' *tipping* point ' marine scientists have warned
4 - degree global temperature rise would mean ' game over ' for heritage site
