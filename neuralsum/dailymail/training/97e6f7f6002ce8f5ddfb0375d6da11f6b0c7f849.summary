@entity1 leader : the party is facing more embarrassment over @entity5 's plans for a mansion tax @entity1 faces more embarrassment over its mansion tax plans after an independent report found council tax reform would be ‘ fairer ’ and raise four times as much			1
@entity5 claims his flagship policy will raise £ 1.2billion a year for the @entity13 on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
but the @entity15 says it is ‘ improbable ’ that they would raise so much			1
instead , it claimed that tweaking council tax bands , which have not changed for 25 years , would be a more ‘ progressive ’ way to raise revenue			1
adding three extra brackets for high - end properties would generate an extra £ 4.7billion a year , it said			1
critics say a mansion tax would target pensioners on low incomes whose property has soared in value in recent decades , while also disproportionately hitting people in @entity29 and the @entity30			0
the @entity15 said that if politicians reformed council tax instead , existing discounts and exemptions would ‘ mostly shield ’ those on low incomes			1
it said : ‘ unlike the proposed mansion tax , a reformed system of council tax does not punitively over-tax a certain group of home owners – those whose homes are valued above £ 2 million – or a particular region of the country			1
’ the major new report will undermine the policy further and put pressure on the party to consider ‘ sensible ’ alternatives			0
@entity48 , founder of the @entity50 campaign , which commissioned the study , said the findings showed that @entity1 was ‘ ignoring a fairer approach simply to score ill - informed public support ’			0
mr @entity48 said : ‘ our report reveals that @entity1 ’s proposed mansion tax is a far less effective revenue raiser compared with a sensible reassessment of the council tax bands			1
‘ this fairer , more progressive approach to property taxation compared with the proposed @entity64 would provide a shot in the arm to local services and the @entity13 through existing channels , rather than adding more red tape			2
‘ this report demonstrates that a revised system – with those living in the most valuable houses paying more – would yield billions for local services and the @entity13 , while reducing the council tax burden for those living in the least expensive properties			1
’ former @entity1 home secretary @entity77 has already branded mansion tax an ‘ absurd proposition ’ , while dame @entity79 said she was ‘ concerned ’ about the effect on the asset - rich but cash - poor			2
senior party figures : shadow chancellor @entity83 ( left ) was forced to deny criticism by @entity1 grandee @entity85 ( right ) that people would be ' clobbered ' by the tax on homes worth over £ 2million labour grandee and former business secretary @entity85 has also backed council tax reform over mansion tax , saying : ‘ it will take longer to introduce , that ’s true , but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude , short - term mansion tax			1
’ every property in @entity98 is in one of eight council tax bands – a to @entity101 – based on house valuations from 1991			1
but since then house prices have escalated			0
currently , band a is for homes under £ 40,000 , of which hardly any remain , while @entity101 is for homes over £ 320,000			0
the @entity15 has proposed bands set from a to @entity108 , with the lowest band for homes under £ 85,000 and the highest band for homes over £ 4million			2
those in band @entity108 would be charged £ 4,493 a year , almost £ 1,500 more than they pay now , while the average homeowner would pay £ 167 a year more			0
affected by the plans : a road in @entity118 , south - west @entity29 , which has more than a dozen properties valued at more than £ 2million according to @entity120 it means the largest homes would be billed four - and - a - half times more than the cheapest , compared to just three times more now			2
if politicians wanted to raise a more modest £ 1.2billion , they could exempt everyone in band a and give discounts to those in bands b and @entity131 @entity1 claims the £ 2million threshold will rise in line with prime property prices			2
they also insist that low - income homeowners would not have to pay up front and could instead wait until the property changed hands			0
@entity1 mp @entity140 , and chair of the influential @entity142 , cautiously welcomed the report , but was reluctant to criticise the party ’s key election proposal			0
she said : ‘ all political parties have , in an absurd and cowardly way , failed to review council tax bands since 1991			1
@entity1 mp @entity140 ( pictured ) , chair of the @entity142 , cautiously welcomed the report ‘ it is ridiculous that somebody whose house is worth £ 30million is in the same council tax band as someone whose home is £ 320,000			1
’ asked if mr @entity5 should consider council tax reform rather than controversial mansion tax , she added : ‘ as we develop our proposals around property taxation we should look in detail at other proposals like this			1
’ sir @entity165 , conservative mp for @entity166 , said last night : ‘ mansion tax is absurd and ridiculous			0
it is morally and intellectually indefensible			0
‘ even half the @entity1 have identified it as a foolish and unworkable			0
‘ unlike mansion tax , the proposed reforms to council tax would use an existing system which we already understand and which we know is workable			2
‘ i do not want to see an increase in taxation in any area because i believe in low taxes			0
but if it is necessary to do something , then adjusting council tax bands is infinitely more sensible means of doing it than mansion tax			2
’ he added : ‘ it certainly deserves to be looked at whoever wins the election			0
’ since council tax was introduced in 1993 , ‘ property values around @entity98 have shifted drastically ’ , the @entity15 said			1
a revaluation in @entity98 was planned for 2007 but was postponed in 2005 by the @entity1 government and not looked at again by the @entity193			0
politicians have been reluctant to change council tax bands because it could mean higher bills for homeowners , but the @entity15 said it should be revisited			1
they claim their proposals would ‘ shift part of the tax burden to occupants of very high value properties ’ in a fair way			2
they estimated that the revaluation of properties across the @entity208 would cost £ 257million to implement			0
@entity1 claims the £ 2million threshold will rise in line with prime property prices			0
they also insist low income homeowners would not have to pay mansion tax up front and could instead wait until the property changed hands .			0

@entity5 claims policy will raise £ 1.2bn for the @entity13 on home worth £ 2m
@entity15 says amount is ' improbable '
said tweaking council tax would be more ' progressive way ' to raise money
suggested three extra brackets for high - end properties to generate £ 4.7bn
