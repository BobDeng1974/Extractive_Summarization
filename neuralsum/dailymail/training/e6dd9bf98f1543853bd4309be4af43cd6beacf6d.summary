an inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor @entity20			0
the @entity22 - born medic was struck off by the @entity23 but was able to continue working in his adopted country of @entity6 after the authorities there let him off with a nine - month suspended prison sentence and a small fine			1
mr @entity15 ’s furious sons @entity30 and @entity31 , confronted their father ’s killer at a medical conference in @entity5 , @entity35 , where he was plugging his cosmetic surgery clinic the day after snubbing the @entity23 hearing			1
in dramatic scenes , the brothers called him a ‘ charlatan ’ and a ‘ killer ’ and demanded he explain his ‘ colossal blunder ’			0
shortly before they were thrown out , @entity31 muttered to his brother that @entity1 was an ‘ animal ’ – something he believes he was unaware of until it was mentioned in legal documents long after the incident			1

@entity1 on his first shift in the @entity9 , @entity15 ( left ) , 70 , with ten times the safe amount of pain killer diamorphine ; @entity55 ( right ) arriving at court in the @entity6 town of @entity58 to watch the trial of @entity1 who killed his father @entity61 he is claiming € 1,148 for the loss of a speaking fee after leaving the conference in 2010 and € 2,250 for legal fees – a total of around £ 2,700			1
the action also includes a demand that @entity31 will not describe him as an animal in future after he ignored a lawyers letter insisting he confirmed in writing he would not use the word again			0
bizarrely , the case is almost identical to one @entity1 brought against the @entity74 in august 2010			1
on that occasion his claim for compensation was thrown out and he had to pay the brothers ’ legal costs			0
the @entity6 court also ruled they could refer to him as a ‘ charlatan and a killer ’ but not describe him as an ‘ animal ’			1

@entity31 , 49 , told the @entity86 : ‘ it is grotesque			0
he has already taken this to court once and lost everything except the bit about calling him an animal			2
he was n’t even aware of that until i produced a transcript from a camcorder recording i made at the conference			2
‘ four years later his lawyer sent me a letter demanding i promised to pay him a lot of money if i ever called him that again			0
i am not going to write to him			0
this is the man who came into my dad ’s house and killed him			0
‘ i do n’t understand the case and my lawyer ca n’t understand it either			0
it ’s an abuse of the legal process			0
‘ @entity1 ’s just trying to extract money from the family of his victim			2
he seems to think he ’s invincible since the @entity6 authorities took action that stopped him being prosecuted in the @entity9			1
’ @entity111 , a 54 - year - old gp from @entity113 , added : ‘ this guy is obviously morally and ethically corrupt			2
‘ he killed my father through gross negligence but obviously he is not happy with that and wants to take my brother to court as he claims he missed a meal and payment for a conference			2
i consider him to be a weasel			0
’ the case is due to be heard on monday at @entity124 , although @entity126 ’s lawyer has requested an @entity128 ’s death in 2008 prompted a review of out - of - hours services , particularly a loophole which allowed doctors from the @entity133 with poor @entity20 to practise here because of rules on the free movement of labour			1
last week new laws were introduced that allow the @entity23 to withhold a licence if they have concerns about an individual			2
the regulator wrote to the @entity74 congratulating them on their efforts to have the law changed			0
