by @entity0 published : 16:32 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 02:31 est , 6 september 2013 from ' feebleness of intellect ' to ' women trouble ' the reasons a patient could be admitted to a lunatic asylum in the late 1800s reveals inequality and a poor understanding of mental health issues			1
while the startling list of reasons for admission at @entity14 may give only a glimpse of what caused the patient to be sent there , it reveals a lot about society 's attitudes			1
the sprawling @entity23 institution was closed in 1994 , after more than 100 years of lobotomies and cold bath treatments for its patients , many of whom just had the misfortune to have been abandoned by their families			1
locked away : @entity23 's @entity14 was open to the ' feeble minded ' a theme quickly emerges in the list , which was published on @entity34 , showing how women in particular were at the mercy of their husbands and families			1
' marriage of son ' , ' desertion by husband ' and ' domestic trouble ' all stand out as examples of inequality masked by a very different attitude to women 's rights between 1864 to 1889 , when the list was compiled			2
' in 1872 ... if [ a woman 's ] husband had a mistress or if she had inherited money ... he could bring her here , ' a guide at the former asylum told the @entity54			2
' he could sign her in and leave her until he decided to come back and get her - or until she died , whichever came first			0
' women 's health issues were also seemingly neglected under a catch all of lunacy			2
' @entity65 female trouble ' , ' suppression of menses ' - which could be the case of being pregnant out of wedlock , or caused by an eating disorder or other illness - and hysteria			0
the weaker sex , as women were defined at the time the asylum first opened , also meant a strong attitude could land them in trouble , with ' nymphomania ' and ' seduction and disappointment ' reasons for admission			0
admitted : a list shows the reasons given for having a patient moved to the asylum from 1864 to 1889 construction of the asylum , which is nearly quarter of a mile long , began in 1858			0
it was originally intended to house ' 240 ' souls , but at its peak in the 1950s 2,400 patients were crammed in together			2
although records show many people were admitted for sexual deviance or promiscuity , others were admitted for ' bad company ' or even ' bad whiskey '			0
suspicions of crime or suicide are also alluded to			0
among the admissions are entries for gun shot wounds , shooting a child and ' rumor of husband murder '			0
the effects of the civil war , and even office work , also appeared to have had its toll on @entity23 residents , with possible early cases of post traumatic stress syndrome and nervous breakdowns appearing			1
entries for ' @entity112 ' , ' exposure in army ' and ' fell from a horse in the war ' appear , alongside ' business nerves ' and ' over taxing mental powers '			0
patients at the hospital would have been exposed to methods that were considered ground breaking in their day , but cruel by today 's standards			1
foreboding : the @entity23 asylum , with its long , stark corridors , has been empty since 1994 tours : the only people admitted to the hospital now are tourists wanting to hear grisly details about its past from the guides who dress as nurses a nurse recalled being present as a doctor performed a lobotomy with an ice - pick type instrument , and other patients were subjected to cold bath treatments in an attempt to stop their hysteria			1
@entity14 finally closed in 1994 , as attitudes and the treatment of patients with mental health issues changed			1
today the main building , which had separate wings for @entity149 patients when it was first constructed , still takes admissions - for ghost tours and heritage seekers who want to explore the desolate wards and gruesome medical centers .			0
