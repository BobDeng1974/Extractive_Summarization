' @entity37 runs a small apple juice , cider and perry business in @entity41 , @entity42 , and makes under 170 hectolitres of cider from the 16 acre orchard to sell at markets and a pub. he told the @entity47 the tax introduction would be ' another nail in the coffin '			0
' the exemption is fundamental to keeping craft cider - making going			0
if we had to pay an extra Â£ 2,500 it would probably stop us risking making wooden - barrel cider and perry because it 's too fragile			2
