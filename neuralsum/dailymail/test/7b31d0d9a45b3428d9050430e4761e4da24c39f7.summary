@entity1 's timing could n't be better , and it could n't be worse			1
@entity3 's junior senator is poised to enter the 2016 presidential contest on tuesday , at a moment when only sen. @entity6 , the @entity8 darling , is already in the race and consuming precious news - cycle oxygen			1
but the issue that made him a national figure two years ago – domestic snooping by the @entity15 – is no longer on @entity17 's front - burner			2
@entity1 will launch his campaign tuesday morning in @entity19 , @entity3 with the populist slogan ' defeat the @entity22 machine			1
' an aide to a member of the @entity1 leadership in the @entity27 laughed that line off on monday			2
' @entity1 is as much a part of the @entity22 machine as @entity53 or @entity54			1
' ' it 's like @entity56 running on a platform of email transparency in government			0
' ' if he 's an outsider , i 'm a @entity62 , ' he said			2
an @entity64 official who said he has n't chosen a horse in the 2016 primary told @entity67 that ' @entity1 is going to have problems if he thinks he can position himself as an outsider			1
' ' that can work for a governor , ' he explained , ' and maybe for his father , who was outside the mainstream in just about every way			0
but it wo n't sell in @entity76 , especially since he 's walking his views back toward the center			1
' both men spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity1 has taken heat in recent days from libertarians for softening some of the principled stands thad have defined his brand since @entity86 sent him to @entity22			1
he described himself as ' a judicial activist ' in january , for instance , telling a conservative audience that federal judged should n't hesitate to toss out majority - rule decisions by @entity92 if they infringe on constituional rights			1
in an interview sunday with the blog @entity96 , however , he said @entity17 ' should leave more power in the hands of the states and local governments			0
' ' more often than not , the longer a federal judge or elected official is in office , the more out of touch they become , ' he said			0
small pond : the only other big fish to announce his candidacy so far is @entity36 sen. @entity6 , an evangelical @entity110 whose views could n't be much more different from @entity1 's @entity1 has found himself occasionally in the policy weeds as the news cycle shifts away from his natural area of strength and into territory where he has yet to define himself			1
@entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 now occupy the space once dominated by @entity15 leaker @entity121			0
and as other @entity1 presidential hopefuls strategize about how to approach the @entity124 foreign policy mess on @entity126 's desk , @entity1 has to contend with his past isolationist statements that make the president 's approach seem bold and reaganesque by comparison			1
in february he warned a @entity131 gathering that ' until we understand at least a modicum of what animates our enemies , we can not defend ourselves and we can not contain our enemies			0
' that word – ' contain ' – put him on the path to what conservatives have griped most about in the @entity126 administration 's foreign policy : a tendency toward acceptance of global threats instead of a willingness to wipe them out			0
in the @entity96 interview , he sauntered back toward the @entity149 from its tenuous shoulder			0
' i support military action against @entity154 , ' he said of the @entity156 terror army , adding that ' if we are to go to war , we should make it brief , succinct and we must fight to win			1
' he did allow , however , that ' there must be a vote by @entity92 and a formal declaration of war			0
' @entity1 would be the first major - party candidate with roots in @entity3 to run for president since @entity166 , who was born in a one - room log cabin in the @entity3			2
he teased his tuesday announcement over the weekend with a 3 - minute @entity170 video reprising portions of his february speech at the @entity173 near @entity22 ' to fix @entity22 , we ca n't have business as usual , ' @entity1 says in one clip			1
' it 's time for a new way			0
a new set of ideas			0
a new leader , one you can trust			0
one who works for you and , above all , it 's time for a new president , ' out of the gate already : @entity1 has been making campaign - style stops in the eary primary state of @entity189 , like this march 21 appearance in the @entity189 town of @entity192 winner : @entity1 has won three straight straw polls at the annual @entity173 , buoyed by throngs of young libertarians whose views are often at odds with mainline conservatism the video ends as his @entity173 speech did , with boisterous shouts of ' president @entity1 ! president @entity1 ! ' from a largely young and libertarian - leaning audience			1
sandwiched in the middle , is his problematic slogan : ' on april 7 , one leader will stand up to defeat the @entity22 machine and unleash the @entity17 dream			2
' @entity1 won a straw - poll of @entity173 attendees for the third year in a row			2
his next big test will be winning support from high - dollar donors			0
he is expected to focus some of his rhetorical firepower on reforming the @entity216 with a ' flat ' tax system that would eliminate much of @entity17 's labyrinthine income tax code in favor of a 5 - minute math exercise			0
the senator also advocates for limiting the length of time members of @entity92 can serve in @entity22 , and for criminal justice reform – especially in cases where drug users and low - level traffickers have been sentenced to lengthy mandatory - minimum prison terms			1
but he has been silent on the two most discussed news stories of the last few weeks			0
unlike @entity6 , @entity1 has n't weighed in on the @entity231 and @entity232 religious - freedom laws that caused a gay - rights furor			1
and his campaign - in - waiting has held its fire on @entity126 's triumphant proclamations that a nuclear deal with @entity238 is all but in the bag .			2

@entity1 slogan will *underscore* a tuesday presidential campaign launch
he 's *battling* *perceptions* that he has *softwned* some of his once - rock - solid libertarian positions in order to build broad electoral appear
@entity1 was for ' containing ' @entity154 , and now says he supports military action ; he was ' a judicial activist ' in *constitutional* cases but now complains judges are ' out of touch '
@entity64 official says the senator 's claims to @entity22 - outsider status ' wo n't sell in @entity76 ' although it might work for a governor
