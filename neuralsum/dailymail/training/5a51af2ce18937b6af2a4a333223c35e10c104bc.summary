by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 11:17 est , 22 january 2014 former dj @entity3 ' groped a journalist 's breasts and asked her to pose for a suggestive photograph , @entity2 heard today a journalist has told a court that veteran dj @entity3 ' groped ' her breasts after asking her to pose for suggestive photographs for him			1
the woman , who was in her 20s at the time , said she knew @entity3 , now 68 , was suggesting she pose in a bikini or her underwear after noticing a similar photo of a pop star on his wall			1
the witness , who can not be identified for legal reasons , said the incident took place when she went to the former @entity25 presenter ’s home to interview him about a photograph of him and @entity27			2
she told @entity28 ’s @entity2 that while there she noticed a ' provocative ' photograph on the wall of a pop star she believed to be @entity33 from @entity34 posing on her knees in a bikini			2
she said : ‘ i ’m not an expert but it was a lady from @entity34			0
i knew there were two blonde ones and i recognised it to be the taller one , who i thought was @entity33			2
giving evidence from behind a screen , she recalled events , and told jurors that as they both looked at the picture : ' @entity3 said to me " i ’m also a photographer and i took this photograph "			1
' he slightly looked down at me and said " well , you ’ve got a good figure , i could take a photograph of you "			0
' the woman said she felt ' embarrassed ' and ' taken aback ' but did not say much in reply			0
describing the former @entity58 presenter , known as @entity3 , as a ' larger - than - life character ' , she said they then proceeded with the interview in the recording studio at his home before chatting more generally as there was time to kill before he dropped her at the station			1
the woman said she felt as though she was in an ' enclosed space ' as they spoke face to face in his kitchen			0
she went on : ' he raised photography and said again " i could take some photos of you "			0
@entity3 , 68 , had a suggestive photograph of @entity34 star @entity33 , right , on his wall , the court was told ' the first time when i dismissed it , i thought the conversation would n’t happen again			1
' the fact that he raised it again , i almost felt like i had to justify myself			0
' i burst out " no - and anyway , my boobs are n’t big enough " , because i thought that would put him off			0
' he did n’t say anything , there was a split second where neither of us said anything , and then suddenly he put his arms out and put his hands on my breasts and then quizzically put his head to the side as if he was judging himself - whether they were big enough			1
' the woman said she thought @entity3 left his hands there for a ' couple of seconds '			1
she went on : ' it felt to me like he knew that this was an opportunity			0
in hindsight i see that he was looking for an opportunity and he took it			0
i did not invite him to touch me			0
' the picture was very obviously about a young girl in a bikini showing her cleavage			0
' i knew what he meant when he said i had a good figure			2
he wanted me to strip down			2
' the journalist said she went to interview @entity3 for an article about him and @entity27 , pictured in 1980 during cross-examination from @entity123 , defending @entity3 , the woman said she would never pose for such photographs for anyone			1
' it ’s highly inappropriate and tacky and i ’d be highly embarrassed if i ’d be coerced into doing something like that , ' she told jurors			0
mr @entity123 put it to the woman that @entity3 had said the incident did not happen			1
' that ’s a lie , ' she said			0
wearing a light grey blazer and patterned tie , @entity3 sat in the dock listening to the evidence through headphones and smiled as the photograph of him and @entity27 was mentioned			2
describing the moments after @entity3 allegedly groped her , the woman said she did not acknowledge what he had done as she ' did n’t process it at all at the time ' and wanted to remain professional			1
they carried on talking but ' his behaviour changed a bit ' and he became less chatty			0
she said no - one else was in the house apart from a cleaner she saw briefly when she arrived , but he said his wife was resting upstairs			0
@entity2 : jurors heard from the journalist 's flatmates , who said she was upset after the interview the witness said she did not go to police or say anything to her bosses at the time as she ' did n’t want to make a big fuss ' or jeopardise her career			1
she said she simply thought @entity3 was a ' pervy old man taking the opportunity to do that to me ' , but decided to go to police after other allegations about @entity3 came out in the press and she ' felt a real responsibility to come forward '			1
friends of the journalist who lived with her also gave evidence , telling jurors they discussed what @entity3 had allegedly done to her that evening			1
one friend said she appeared ' stressed ' and ' upset ' when she came home from work			0
the witness said her friend told her : ' he ’d made a lascivious comment about , i do n’t know , drawing her or something , and then after that he ’d placed both his hands on her breasts			1
' another friend who lived with her told jurors : ' she was quite shaken and upset and talked to me about what had happened			0
' she said that the whole time she was conducting the interview @entity3 was being very touchy feely with her - very tactile , giving her hugs , putting his arm around her , that sort of thing			1
' towards the end of their meeting she had been in his kitchen and @entity3 had sort of lunged at her and touched her breasts			2
' @entity3 , of @entity201 , denies a charge of sexual assault against the woman in 2008			1
he is also charged with 13 counts of indecent assault dating back to 1976 and as recently as 2003 , covering the time when he worked as a @entity25 @entity208 , as a broadcaster with @entity210 , on @entity58 , and as a panto star			2
