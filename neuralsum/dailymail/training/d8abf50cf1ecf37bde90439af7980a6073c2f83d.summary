three @entity1 players were dropped by @entity3 manager @entity2 as they beat @entity4 1 - 0 at the @entity5 to secure qualification for the last - 16			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 were all replaced in the starting line - up as @entity4 frustrated the @entity11			1
@entity13 's @entity12 and @entity14 failed to impose themselves on the match and will need to improve if @entity3 do hold hopes of going far in this tournament			1
following a phenomenal season on loan at @entity43 - which bagged him a @entity46 title and a @entity47 final - @entity36 has taken his form into the @entity5 in @entity49			2
this was his 100th career clean sheet and he is only 22			0
@entity53 and @entity13 , take notice			0
@entity36 commands his box so well and every single cross from the @entity58 side he was quick to catch and hold			0
a couple of decent saves from @entity61 in the first half and another from @entity63 were all he had to do really , but he did it was ease which was impressive			0
impressive : @entity13 goalkeeper @entity36 kept his 100th career clean sheet against @entity4 victory : @entity36 claps the @entity3 fans as he leaves the field following a composed display in goal @entity18 dominant display			1
whenever the @entity73 back has the ball at his feet he looks so composed and rarely puts a foot wrong			0
was caught out of position just before half - time as @entity61 ghosted in between the centre backs to nod a free header wide , but apart from that he looked extremely assured			0
if @entity3 are to go far in this tournament then they will need him to stay fit and lead from the front			2
dominant : @entity86 's @entity18 ( left ) was composed and in control in defence for @entity3 captain marvel : @entity18 ( second left ) congratulates goal scorer @entity34 after he nets @entity3 's winner @entity8 one of three @entity1 players dropped before the match for @entity3 , he soon was back on the pitch following @entity96 's injury			1
he sometimes struggles for pace at full back and was caught out a few times , but overall he is a tidy footballer and is very solid			0
comfortable afternoon for him in all honesty as @entity101 's @entity4 offered so little going forward			2
substitute : @entity1 's @entity8 ( left ) was dropped but came on after 31 minutes solid : @entity104 did his job well at left back once he replaced the injured @entity96 for @entity3 @entity96 it just has not been his season			1
dropped by @entity109 at @entity110 , persistent injury problems curtailed him from being able to force his way back into his club side			2
he was given his chance here at left - back and had done relatively little wrong before he was forced down the tunnel with an injury after just 31 minutes			0
he suffered a knee injury during the warm - up and had to come off			0
frustrated : @entity110 defender @entity96 looks disappointed as he leaves the field injured knock : @entity96 suffered a knee injury in the warm - up and has been plagued by fitness problems @entity12 @entity124 really struggled to leave up to the hype in this match - until the final three minutes			1
two frustrating performances for the @entity13 man - @entity128 has been @entity3 's shining light and @entity12 has been merely an observer for large parts - but he has provided two assists in two games now			1
a few decent tricks and flicks but he kept giving the ball away and there was no end product until , with 87 minutes on the clock , he jinked inside two @entity58 players and laid the ball off for @entity25 to bag the winner			0
if he can find form then @entity3 could really be strong in the latter stages of this tournament , but @entity12 does n't look entirely comfortable with this formation			2
nothing seems to be happening for the little magician at the moment			0
tricky : hazard was frustrated for large parts of the match but came up with an assist late - on control : @entity154 only showed glimpses of the quality that he possesses in the match against @entity4 improvement : if @entity3 can get the best out of @entity12 then they could go far in @entity49 @entity14 it really has not been the @entity13 man 's tournament has it			1
he was extremely poor again for @entity3 following his anonymous display against @entity166			2
after failing to register a shot in his first match , or even making a touch in the opposition penalty area , he looked lethargic and did not work hard enough for @entity2 ' men against @entity4			2
the ball kept bouncing back from him towards @entity58 defenders and would not stick to hit feet			0
he was deservedly replaced for the second match in a row by @entity178 's 19 - year - old forward @entity34 after 57 minutes , who has offered far more than @entity14 has and bagged @entity3 's winner			1
@entity181 being proved right in refusing to give the big man a chance to lead the line at @entity13 ? poor : @entity13 's @entity14 ( left ) was again disappointing for @entity3 and was replaced on 57 minutes off the pace : the ball kept bouncing off @entity14 and he was not able to get himself into the game option : @entity14 's replacement @entity34 ( left ) netted the winner with three minutes to go @entity191 the @entity193 midfielder was rewarded for his equaliser against @entity195 with a start against @entity4 but he did little right , or little wrong			1
a fairly non-descriptive performance from @entity191 who really did not dominate and use his huge physical presence as well as he should have done			0
there were a few aerial challenges won and a few neat interchanges with @entity128 in the first half but , as @entity3 were pushed deeper in the second half , @entity191 offered little threat			0
average : @entity193 midfielder @entity191 ( centre ) did little right or wrong for @entity3 committed : @entity191 competes for the ball with @entity4 's @entity209 during @entity3 's 1 - 0 win @entity211 replaced @entity128 after 75 minutes			1
@entity128 had been @entity3 's best player in the first half but faded in the second			2
@entity211 hit the post with a free - kick with seven minutes remaining , probably @entity3 's best chance , and then should have scored in injury time when he was set one - on - one by @entity12 but shot straight at the goalkeeper			1
had a fantastic season at @entity220 but struggling to get into this @entity11 side at the moment but , given a start , he could prove the difference for them			0
replacement : @entity220 's @entity211 ( right ) came on for @entity128 after 75 minutes @entity227 : @entity211 ( left ) celebrates with forward @entity34 as @entity3 record a 1 - 0 victory over @entity4			1

@entity3 beat @entity4 1 - 0 in their second @entity5 match
there were eight @entity234 players on show for @entity3
three @entity1 players were dropped from the first match
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 did not start
@entity110 's @entity96 limped off , replaced by @entity104
