at her trial , @entity1 , who worked in the jail 's medical centre , claimed @entity23 , who is serving life for multiple offences of rape and violence , raped her then intimidated her so she would not report it			2
but jurors at @entity41 rejected the claim after hearing how she became inappropriately close to @entity23 , after he duped her into thinking he had wealth on the outside , and started a sexual relationship			0

i hope this will allow you to progress without any further disruption			0
' and in a letter dated august 23 last year she accepted she had been convicted of the charges and was serving a custodial sentence			0

' bearing in mind the need to uphold proper standards and to maintain public confidence in the profession and the @entity29 as regulator , the panel was satisfied that mrs @entity1 's fitness to practise is currently impaired by reason of her convictions			1
' the panel concluded that @entity1 's conduct and convictions were fundamentally incompatible with her continuing to be a registered nurse			1
' the only proportionate and appropriate sanction , sufficient to protect the public and maintain confidence in the profession , is a striking - off order , ' mr @entity83 said .			0
