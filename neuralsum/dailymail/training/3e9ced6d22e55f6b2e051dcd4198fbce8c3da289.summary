@entity0 made a new start in the wake of their @entity4 nightmare but only after being dragged back into an old quarrel with @entity6			1
mercifully for @entity9 , new signing @entity7 missed all but the last 13 minutes of another brutal encounter between these two rivals , exactly two months after their @entity4 quarter - final had descended into the @entity13			1
@entity14 left the stadium – and the tournament – on a stretcher that night , and it was perhaps fitting that he should return as @entity0 ’s new captain to settle the rematch with a magnificent freekick seven minutes from time			1

scorer : @entity14 83 booked : @entity41 , @entity43 @entity6 : @entity57 ; @entity27 ( @entity58 72 ) , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 45 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 85 ) , @entity67 ( @entity7 77 ) ; @entity68 ( @entity69 64 ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 64 )			1

sent off : @entity80 booked : @entity80 , @entity65 , @entity27 , @entity60 , @entity70 referee : @entity82 attendance : 73,429 he was once again on the end of some roughhouse treatment from the @entity87 who lost @entity89 to a red card three minutes after half - time for his second bookable offence on the @entity94 star			1
four of @entity96 ’s teammates were also booked including @entity27 for a foul on @entity14 , having escaped any punishment in @entity99 for the cynical knee to the back which fractured his opponent ’s vertebrae			2
the @entity105 were far from innocent that night either as @entity42 went to work on @entity67 in a game that brought a tournament high 54 fouls			0
it was surprising that only two of their number were booked on this occasion by increasingly beleaguered @entity114 referee @entity82			0
so it was perhaps for the best that @entity7 stayed out of the way , just nine days before he is due to make his debut for @entity9 at home to @entity120 following a £ 6m loan move from @entity122 on transfer deadline day			2
@entity6 coach @entity124 decided that it was best to put his star striker on the bench at the end of a week in which he had travelled to @entity131 by private jet to complete the deal , and kept him there until the 77th minute when @entity7 replaced @entity67 to a huge ovation			1
however , his only notable contribution was to head a 90th minute chance over the bar			0
going to ground : @entity14 is felled under the challenge of @entity6 's @entity63 taking a tumble : @entity14 falls to the ground under the challenge in @entity28 's @entity144 challenge : @entity146 new boy @entity65 battles for the ball with @entity0 frontman @entity46 determined : @entity0 's former @entity149 defender @entity38 looks to get ahead of @entity65 in the area by then , @entity0 had snatched the decisive goal , @entity14 curling his freekick into the top corner from the edge of the box			1
it was a reminder of his mercurial talent and of what @entity0 lost at the @entity4 following his sad exit			2
could he have helped avert that tumultuous semi-final defeat to @entity162 in @entity163 ? could he have saved @entity166 @entity165 ’s job ? we ’ll never know			0
all that matters now is that he gave @entity165 ’s successor @entity170 victory in his first game back in charge and @entity14 ’s first as captain			1
it was also @entity6 ’s first since their quarter - final defeat and they did not look like a team who were willing to forgive and forget			2
this was n’t a friendly in any sense of the word			0
a sellout crowd of over 73,429 in the @entity185 – tickets were apparently selling on the black market for up to $ 4,500 on friday – certainly got a competitive game			0
the @entity189 face the @entity190 here on sunday and it is unlikely to be any more physical			0
battle : @entity0 left back @entity40 holds off a challenge from @entity6 wideman @entity89 committed : @entity40 , @entity38 and @entity41 defend the area as @entity6 striker @entity68 looks on there was just one minute 50 seconds on the clock when new @entity149 signing @entity40 hacked down @entity96			1
@entity41 and @entity43 were both shown yellow cards for fouling the @entity201 winger , who was one of a number of players linked with @entity9 this summer , and were followed into the book by @entity27 , @entity60 , @entity65 and @entity70			2
when @entity80 , who had been the first to be cautioned for bringing down @entity14 , pulled back the same player three minutes after half - time he was off			1
the litany of fouls , bad - tempered niggles and angry crowding of the referee by both sets of players once again denied us the chance to enjoy the skills of players like @entity14 and @entity67			2
protection : @entity38 makes sure @entity0 goalkeeper @entity34 has hold of the ball following a @entity6 effort at goal eyes on the prize : @entity89 gathers the ball under pressure from @entity0 midfielder @entity43 it also overshadowed the rest of the goalmouth action that saw @entity40 denied by an offside flag , @entity226 send a magnificent rising shot just over the bar from 30 yards and @entity34 scoop an awkward effort from @entity67 around the post			1
the @entity0 goalkeeper had been brought in to replace @entity234 as @entity170 started his second term in charge by ushering in a new era in @entity105 football			0
only 10 of the @entity4 contingent made his squad this time around and only four of the line - up in @entity99 started here			0
it included four @entity149 players in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity48 and @entity44			0
@entity14 ’s late strike means that @entity0 ’s 1994 @entity4 winning captain now has an impressive record that reads played 61 , won 43 , drawn 12			1
they wo n’t come any harder fought than this one .			0

new @entity9 striker @entity7 came on as a substitute for @entity6 against @entity0
captain @entity14 scored only goal of the game to give @entity0 1 - 0 victory
@entity6 wideman @entity89 was *dismissed* *shortly* after half - time
