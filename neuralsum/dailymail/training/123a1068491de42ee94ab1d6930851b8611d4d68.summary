human nature , sadly , is not like that – but you can boost the chance of straight answers by asking questions in the morning			2
a study found that it is easier for people to lie in the afternoon as the self - control which normally stops them cheating breaks down as they get tired			1
a study by @entity18 found that men and women find it easier fib and deceive in the afternoon when they are tired , than in the morning researchers added that the more fundamentally honest someone is , the more likely they are to succumb to the ‘ morning morality effect ’			1
they said : ‘ our findings suggest that the mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally			2
’ are you more likely to lie in the afternoon than the morning ? the conclusion came from experiments at @entity18 in @entity33 , @entity34			1
in one , a group of young men and women were shown a pattern of dots on a computer and asked to say if there were more on the right or left of the screen			0
in some cases , it was hard to tell but in others the correct answer was clear			0
the volunteers were given cash for every round they played			0
however , the payments were not given for answering correctly			0
instead , the participants were given ten times as much for choosing the right side of the screen rather than the left , which encouraged fibbing			0
those who played the game in the afternoon were more likely to say the dots were on the right when they were clearly on the left , reported the journal @entity61			0
are there benefits to lying ? the @entity34 researchers said that people who lie with ease on a regular basis are less affected by the stress and strains of everyday life a second experiment tested if respondents were more aware of ethics in the morning than in the afternoon			1
men and women were given words with missing letters and asked to complete them			0
those taking part in the morning were more likely to see @entity80 _ _ _ c _ _ and _ _ @entity82 and think of the words ‘ ethical ’ and ‘ moral ’			2
but those doing the test in the afternoon tended to form the words ‘ effects ’ and ‘ coral			0
’ two further experiments confirmed that people become more flexible with the truth as they day went on			1
the study also showed that those who prided themselves on being honest were more susceptible to the effect			1
three experiments showed the more honest someone is , the more likely they are to lie when they are tired and their willpower wanes it is thought that tiredness makes it harder for them to exercise the self - control needed to resist the temptation to cheat			1
in contrast , those who lie with ease have less self - control to begin with and so are less affected by the strains of everyday life			1
the researchers said : ‘ we found that people are vulnerable to a gradual depletion of self - regulatory processes as a result of unremarkable daily activities			1
‘ this depletion can , in turn , lead them to act in ethically questionable ways			0
‘ unfortunately , it might be that the most honest people are most susceptible to the negative consequences associated with the morning mortality effect			2
‘ in other words , our findings suggest that the mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally			2

@entity34 researchers found the self - control needed to *prevent* us from lying breaks down as we get tired
the @entity18 study said the more fundamentally honest someone is , the more likely they are to succumb to the ' morning morality effect '
three experiments showed that people become more flexible with the truth as the day goes on
