@entity0 has stressed the need for relentless self - belief when @entity3 target a rare victory over world champions @entity6 on saturday			1
@entity3 last toppled the @entity6 61 years ago , since when they have suffered 25 successive defeats against them and conceded more than 800 points in the process			1
@entity6 end their @entity11 tour at the @entity12 this weekend , in what will be a final appearance on @entity16 and @entity17 shores until next year 's @entity18			2
@entity3 full - back @entity0 knows his team will have to be at their best to defeat @entity6 they are firm favourites to beat @entity3 once again , but a home team that contains 10 @entity24 players - including full - back @entity0 - should not be dismissed lightly			1
' it 's a huge challenge , but one that we are very excited about , ' @entity0 said			1
' we will have to be at the top of our game to be in with a shout of winning			0
' we need to play for the 80 minutes and can not afford to have a lapse of concentration against a side as good as the @entity6			2
@entity0 offloads the ball in training as @entity3 prepare for saturday 's showdown in @entity37 ' we have to believe that we can win , right from the first minute			1
there is respect for them , but we have to treat them exactly the same as other opponents			0
' there is a buzz and excitement and the fact that we have n't beaten the @entity6 for so long means there is an opportunity for us			2
' there have been some great victories during my career in a @entity54 shirt , but to beat the @entity6 would be at the top of them			2
' @entity57 , meanwhile , has hailed @entity3 ' back - row of ' model professionals ' as they prepare to make @entity54 rugby history			1
the breakaway trio of @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 will start their 19th test match together in saturday 's @entity65			0
and that means they remove a revered back - row that played during @entity3 ' so - called 1970s golden era - @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 - from the record books			1
@entity3 defence coach @entity57 has hailed the back row as ' model professionals ' @entity3 captain @entity62 and @entity61 both made their international debuts in 2009 , while number eight @entity63 followed two years later			1
but they have already collected more than 120 caps between them , and all three are @entity78 players			0
' they all came through together , basically , ' @entity3 defence coach @entity57 said			0
' they have been very , very good and proficient for us over the years , and hopefully a lot more years to come			0
' they are all model professionals , they work hard at their game and their lifestyles are excellent			0
we are lucky to have them			0

@entity3 full - back @entity0 calls @entity87 ' a huge challenge '
they have not beaten @entity6 in 61 years - that 's 25 *straight* losses
@entity0 says beating them would be finest *achievement* for @entity3
