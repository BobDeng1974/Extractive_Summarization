banks including @entity1 and @entity2 have come under fire for their treatment of small businesses banks including @entity2 and @entity1 have again come under fire over their treatment of small businesses			1
it has emerged many put firms into high - interest fixed - rate loans then charged them huge fees to switch when interest rates plummeted			1
@entity13 are stepping up pressure on high street lenders , urging them to review their sales of the loans , which have trapped thousands of businesses in poor deals			0
members of the @entity21 are said to be ' furious ' the @entity23 watchdog failed to protect these small firms			2
banks have already paid £ 1.8billion in compensation for mis - sold ' interest rate swaps ' , meant to protect firms if interest rates rose			1
when rates fell to record lows many companies were hit with huge ' breakage ' penalties if they wanted to switch deals			0
more than 14,000 small businesses received compensation			0
but fixed - rate loans and tailored business loans – the centre of the latest row – are not regulated by the @entity41 , meaning customers mis - sold them are not eligible for compensation			1
the @entity41 says such loans can also saddle businesses with huge switching fees			2
some have an interest rate swap buried in the contract , but even the more basic loans can come with huge unpredictable break penalties			2
according to the @entity21 , fixed - rate loans and tailored business loans can be just as dangerous as interest rate swaps			1
it has emerged 60,000 firms were sold these loans – about half by @entity1 , around 11,000 from @entity2 , and 11,272 by @entity57			2
in a damning report earlier this month into the treatment of small firms by banks , the @entity21 said it had received evidence @entity57 mis - sold tailored business loans			1
it said the lender engineered the products so the interest rate swap was buried in the loan – meaning it fell outside the @entity41 's remit			0
firms were hit with penalties of up to 40 per cent of the value of the loan if they wanted to terminate their contract			0
last night @entity74 , a @entity75 member of the @entity21 , said : ' we are furious with the regulator for not picking this up			0
the @entity41 is walking away from its moral responsibility , if not its legal duty , to protect consumers			0
' he added : ' banks need to demonstrate they have changed – and voluntarily resolving this issue would help to resolve that			0
' @entity2 said it is trawling through its sales of fixed - rate loans			1
@entity1 said its fixed - rate loans were ' fundamentally different ' to the tailored business loans sold by @entity57 , with lower break costs .			1
