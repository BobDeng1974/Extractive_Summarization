by @entity0 a multiple sclerosis patient who suffered from terrible tremors has been successfully treated - thanks to an implant inserted into his head			2
father - of - one @entity7 , 43 , was plagued by vicious tremors down the right side of his body after developing the neurological condition			1
they stopped him from carrying out simple everyday tasks such as getting dressed or picking money out of his wallet			1
@entity7 , 43 , had surgery to insert electrodes into his brain to control a severe tremor in his right side			1
the electrodes can be controlled using a portable device ( pictured ) which turns them on and off but after undergoing a risky and complicated operation to fit electrodes into his brain , he can enjoy a better standard of life			1
the operation is a treatment frequently used for @entity31 patients			0
mr @entity7 , from @entity32 , said : ‘ i ’ve got a quality of life back that i thought i had lost forever			1
‘ i want to thank the amazing surgeons who have made a world of difference to my life			0
‘ they ’ve given me my quality of life back , the ability to do simple everyday tasks that i thought i would never be able to do again			1
the device is my own miniature miracle			2
’ with his condition deteriorating and the tremor down the right side of his body getting worse , mr @entity7 was briefed about the possibility of undergoing the surgery last year			1
mr @entity7 has multiple sclerosis and he suffered from such bad tremors he struggled even to get dressed after deliberating over whether to go ahead with the treatment , he decided he had nothing to lose			1
he underwent deep brain stimulation surgery in september 2013 at @entity56 's @entity55			2
the procedure that involves the surgeon implanting leads , which have electrodes at the end , into the brain			1
the leads are then tunnelled under the skin to a device similar to a pacemaker which is fitted in the chest or stomach area			1
it is thought that about 25 to 60 per cent of @entity70 patients have a tremor			2
this is a trembling or shaking movement that the patient can not control			0
it is usually a back - and - forth shaking movement but the tremor can also be irregular and unpredictable			2
it is often described as one of the more difficult symptoms of @entity70 to manage but occupational therapy and drug treatments can help in some cases			0
the treatment mr @entity7 had is called deep brain stimulation			1
it involved electrodes being inserted into his brain attached to a device similar to a pacemaker			1
when the device is switched on , the electrodes send electrical pulses to target the area of the brain that causes the tremor reducing or preventing it			1
source : @entity98 when switched on , the electrodes send electrical pulses to target the area of the brain which helps to control the tremors			1
mr @entity7 can now carry out simple everyday tasks that he had been unable to do for the last three years			1
he said : ‘ my tremor has n’t completely disappeared , obviously , but it ’s so much better than it was			2
i have had to get used to a worsening tremor since my diagnosis			0
‘ the surgeon told me about this treatment but warned me of the risks			0
there was a risk of suffering a stroke , a brain bleed or getting an infection in the brain			0
‘ i put it off for a while but with my tremor getting worse fast i thought i had nothing to lose and said i wanted to go for it			0
‘ i never had any idea it would improve my quality of life so much			0
things like getting dressed , brushing my teeth , fastening zips , getting money out of a wallet			2
‘ they all seem like such simple everyday tasks but i could n’t do any of them			2
now i can , it ’s just made a world of difference			0
‘ on a morning when i switch it on i can feel it in my head as the power surges through			0
‘ i can feel a slight electric shock as well			0
but that ’s a small price to pay to get my quality of life back			0
’ multiple sclerosis is a condition which affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord causing a range of symptoms including problems with muscle movement , balance and vision			0
in some cases , it also causes severe tremors			1
the condition occurs when the protein around each nerve fibre in the brain and spinal cord is damaged			0
this disrupts the transfer of nerve signals and cause symptoms .			0

@entity7 , 43 , had severe tremors down his right side
he struggled even to get dressed on his own and to pick up money
has now been fitted with a device to help stop the tremors
electrodes in his brain target the area that caused the tremor
he is now able to carry out simple tasks that were *impossible* before
