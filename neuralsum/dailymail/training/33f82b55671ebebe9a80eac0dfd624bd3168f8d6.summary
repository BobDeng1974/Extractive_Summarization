between man and woman : a sign displays a message opposed to gay marriage in front of the @entity127 @entity126 polling site in @entity128 , @entity2 landmark vote : @entity2 residents voted to pass a constitutional amendment defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman decision : @entity136 , far left , casts her vote at @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity2 @entity2 law already bans gay marriage , like nine other states , but an amendment would effectively slam the door shut on same - sex marriages			1
the amendment also goes beyond state law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal status , which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for unmarried couples			1

@entity185 , who described himself as a devout @entity186 , voted for the amendment at a polling place in @entity189			0
' i know that some people may argue that the @entity192 may not necessarily be applicable , or it should not be applicable , on such policy matters			0
but even looking at nature itself , procreation is impossible without a man and a woman			0
‘ and because of those things , i think it is important that the state of @entity2 's laws are compatible with the laws of nature but , more importantly , with the laws of @entity99			1

@entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 all have constitutional amendments against gay marriage , and @entity47 's election - year vagueness on gay marriage has come under fresh scrutiny			1
@entity47 , who supports most gay rights , has stopped short of backing gay marriage			2

' if it passes , i think it will be repealed within 20 years			0
' @entity276 contrast : in june of 2011 , revellers celebrated outside the @entity278 in @entity163 after the state passed a bill allowing gay marriage a cause for celebration : revelers celebrated in front of the @entity278 in @entity287 's @entity286 following the passing of the same sex marriage bill the amendment also goes beyond state law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal status , which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for unmarried couples			1
' also , that amendment is against women , i believe , because also underneath the amendment , other laws are saying that people who are n't married at all , they ca n't file for domestic abuse cases , if they 're living with their significant other			2
which is wrong , ' @entity205 said			0
in @entity2 , more than 500,000 voters had cast their ballot before tuesday , which was more than the 2008 primary when @entity47 and @entity310 were fighting for the @entity312 presidential nomination			0
