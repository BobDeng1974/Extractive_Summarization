@entity0 has come out swinging after a week in which @entity1 suffered a desperate @entity4 exit , by declaring he is still the special one			1
days after facing a barrage of criticism for the manner of @entity1 ’s defeat by @entity10 , @entity0 has hit back by bragging that there are a mere handful of managers around the world who can measure up to him			1
@entity0 insists he is still the special one despite @entity4 exit at hands of @entity10 ‘ when i compare myself with other managers i see just a few that are with me in terms of success , ’ he said			1
‘ the others i see a huge distance			2
’ it was a defiant broadside from the colourful @entity28 boss , who vowed that wednesday ’s disaster against ten - man @entity10 — in which his team were branded ‘ babies ’ — will simply spark a @entity33 title charge			1
@entity1 players were described as babies after surrounding @entity35 during @entity4 clash @entity37 ( 2002 – 2004 ) @entity38 : 2002 – 03 , 2003 – 04 @entity39 : 2002 – 03 @entity40 : 2003 @entity4 : 2003 – 04 @entity41 : 2002 – 03 @entity1 ( 2004 – 2007 , 2013 – ) @entity33 : 2004 – 05 , 2005 – 06 @entity42 : 2006 – 07 @entity43 : 2004 – 05 , 2006 – 07 , 2014 – 15 @entity44 : 2005 @entity45 ( 2008 – 2010 ) @entity46 : 2008 – 09 , 2009 – 10 @entity47 : 2009 – 10 @entity48 : 2008 @entity4 : 2009 – 10 @entity49 ( 2010 – 2013 ) @entity50 : 2011 – 12 @entity51 : 2010 – 11 @entity52 : 2012 ‘ with @entity1 , i lost against @entity54 in the last 16 and we were champions that season , ’ he said			1
‘ it was a fantastic season for us			2
‘ i think it ’s the target for everyone , all the big teams at the beginning of the season			2
it ’s the main target			2
if you can win that , i think it ’s fantastic			2
’ speaking before @entity66 beat @entity67 on saturday , @entity0 added : ‘ i think we need nine victories ; 11 matches			1
if our direct opponents lose a couple of points , then you need eight victories and one draw or something like that			0
’ asked about the prospect of winning a third @entity4 title , having already won it at @entity37 and @entity45 , @entity0 said : ‘ it is wrong to assume that			1
people are too worried about me			0
they do n’t know what my happiness is			0
‘ my happiness , first of all , is when i compare myself with the other managers			1
this is not a fight with them and i have lots of respect for all of them			0
' but in the @entity33 , who is @entity95 champion ? me and @entity97			0
in the @entity33 , how many has won it twice or more than twice ? mr @entity99 and myself			0
how many has won every competition in this country ? how many ? ‘ you go to @entity95 , how many won seven league titles ? how many has won two champions @entity104 ? @entity106 has won three and @entity108 has two			0
you are too worried about me			0
@entity0 kisses the @entity4 trophy after his @entity37 side beat @entity111 3 - 0 @entity0 lifts the @entity4 trophy following @entity45 's victory against @entity114 @entity0 holds aloft the @entity33 trophy beside @entity116 and @entity117 @entity0 and @entity117 hug after winning the @entity43 against @entity119 at @entity120 @entity0 and @entity121 celebrate with the trophy following their team 's victory against @entity126 ‘ in the league , we can count the victories we need on the fingers of two hands — one month ago we could n’t do that , we did n’t have enough fingers			1
' there will be a moment where we need five victories , we need four victories and one hand will be enough to count them			0
' i think this is a good way to do it			0
do n’t think about @entity67 , do n’t think about @entity126			0
' @entity0 celebrates in style as @entity1 beat @entity119 to win the @entity43 at @entity120			1
