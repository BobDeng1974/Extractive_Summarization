@entity72 with former @entity7 dictator @entity37			1
mr @entity14 has fought a legal battle against the @entity29 claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the @entity37 regime ‘ this was illegal behaviour and i hope now that the right to take legal advice in private will never be ignored again			1
’ @entity80 , his solicitor , said : ‘ @entity9 unlawfully spied on privileged legal communications for years , and the secret oversight mechanisms failed to stop it			0
‘ this marks the end of @entity9 ’s standard boilerplate response that its activities are lawful , necessary and proportionate			0
i am sure that the unlawful behaviour we have uncovered in this case is the tip of the iceberg			0

but this kind of illegal snooping makes phone hacking look like child ’s play , because it rigs the whole justice game in the government ’s favour			0
’ the @entity18 's ruling said that two documents involving @entity113 ‘ contained material subject to the legal professional privilege … held by @entity9 ’			0
it added : ‘ in order to emphasise the importance of the protection of legally privileged material the tribunal has required @entity9 to give an undertaking that the parts of the documents containing legally privileged information will be destroyed or deleted so as to render such information inaccessible to the agency in the future			0
