the first rule of @entity1 versus @entity2 is : you do not talk about @entity1 versus @entity2			1
the second rule of @entity1 versus @entity2 is : you do not talk about @entity1 versus @entity2			1
@entity1 may have come away with a 1 - 0 win through @entity7 ’s second - half strike , but this match between two @entity10 rivals was more like a scene from cult ‘ 90s film @entity12 , in which @entity14 and @entity15 get normal men kicking lumps out of each other every week , than the showpiece friendly expected			1
as the film goes , the third rule of @entity12 : someone yells stop , goes limp , taps out , the fight is over			0
no - one told the @entity27 players as they repeatedly floored @entity28 with challenge after challenge after challenge			1
@entity32 's @entity7 ( left ) celebrates with team - mates @entity33 and @entity28 having opened the scoring for @entity1 against @entity2 @entity36 managed to skip past the on - coming @entity37 on 72 minutes to slot @entity1 ahead at the @entity38 on sunday @entity28 watches on after tangling with @entity2 defender @entity39 and the former @entity41 player appears to stamp on the @entity42 the @entity44 star is evidently in pain after @entity48 's ( centre ) cynical stamp on @entity28 's leg at the @entity38 on sunday remarkably referee @entity50 did n't punish the stamp by @entity39 as @entity28 was left in pain on the @entity38 pitch @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 ) : @entity54 7 ; @entity55 7 , @entity56 6.5 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 76 ) ; @entity60 6.5 ( @entity33 60 , 6 ) , @entity61 6 ; @entity62 6 ( @entity63 62 , 6 ) , @entity64 6 ( @entity65 60 , 6 ) ; @entity28 7 , @entity66 5.5 ( @entity36 60 , 7 )			1

here at the @entity38 it was 11 on 11			0
the first savage blow came three minutes in			2
@entity42 enforcer @entity60 crunched @entity87			2
somewhere , @entity110 manager @entity109 winced and knew it would be a nervy 90 minutes watching his star player			2
it was clear this was going to be a ‘ friendly ’ in the very loosest terms			0
@entity116 was next in referee @entity50 ’s book , nailing @entity28 twice in a matter of minutes as the @entity27 competed against each other for how many times they could take out @entity1 ’s star man			1
@entity39 tried the hardest , taking him down in a challenge then standing back up on his calf			2
the former @entity41 defender was lucky to remain on the pitch , perhaps helped by @entity28 writhing around as if he had been tasered			1
' they did n’t get much protection , ' @entity76 said of his players ’ treatment after the game			0
on @entity39 ’s stamp , he added : ' the decision is the referee ’s			1
@entity2 has a great team , very dynamic , great fighting , but some players make mistakes			2
these days we have 300 cameras focusing on the action so you have to play football			0
there ’s no other solution			0
' there were flashes of quality and skill , from @entity87 and @entity28 mainly , the pair sending either side of the stadium into raptures of screeching and screaming with their every touch			2
on 37 minutes , @entity28 scooped the ball out of an opponent ’s reach , which prompted their best chance of the first - half			1
the ball made its way to @entity58 and he crossed for @entity62 to the right of goal , who controlled the ball with his chest but could only volley over			0
@entity28 also came close with an in - swinging free kick from out on the right after 26 minutes , which almost tucked into the far right post before @entity37 tipped it wide			1
early in the half @entity87 took a lovely touch to get clear and raced into the box , but was eventually blocked out			0
the first 45 minutes were brought to a close by @entity61 flying in with studs raised only to find air and @entity28 being booked for tripping @entity77			1
if anyone was expecting anything different in the second - half , they were duly disappointed 100 seconds into it when @entity79 went through the back of @entity28 , who was down clutching his ankles yet again			2
@entity87 started taking the game by the scruff of the neck , while the others were too busy taking each other by it , and making things happen			0
the international friendly between @entity1 abd @entity2 added a bit of @entity10 flare to proceedings in a rain drenched @entity196 @entity110 forward @entity87 sprints away from @entity56 ( left ) on the @entity38 pitch he has become very familiar with @entity1 manager @entity76 passes on instructions to his right back @entity55 as he watches his side take on @entity10 rivals @entity2 he got the wrong side of @entity57 on 63 minutes and was brought down , earning the @entity1 defender a yellow card			1
three minutes later he beat three men before being tripped by substitute @entity63 and moments later he was spinning and shimmying past more again			2
the resulting free kicks , however , were poor			0
finally , after 72 minutes of the match , there was a chance of real note - and the @entity42 ’s scored it			1
substitute @entity36 was played through by a wonderful pass from right - back @entity55 and he rounded the goalkeeper to score			0
@entity76 was satisified with victory , he said : ' it 's true @entity2 controlled the game , but we had more chances at goal			2
so it was n't just luck - we deserved to win			0
we are building a competitive team , working through obstacles very well , played against a very strong @entity228 team , changed six players but stayed stable and strong			0
' managers across @entity231 with a vested interest in this game would have been relieved to hear the final whistle blow and no major injuries incurred			0
by the end , seven yellow cards had been brandished and it was incredible there were no reds			0
but the match is over now and , remember , the first rule of @entity1 versus @entity2 is : you do not talk about @entity1 versus @entity2			1
@entity244 left back @entity58 attempts to clear the ball under pressure from @entity2 's @entity85 during the international friendly @entity1 's @entity55 ( left ) in action against @entity2 's @entity250 ( right ) as the @entity10 sides clashed at @entity110 's @entity38 an ardent @entity1 fan wore the green and yellow of her nation as thousands of @entity257 fans attended the @entity1 vs @entity2 match @entity44 star @entity28 keeps his eye on the ball as he tries to control and begin another attack for his national side @entity1 forward @entity66 ( left ) struggles to keep his balance as @entity265 challenges his opponent for possession at the @entity38 on sunday @entity1 right back @entity55 ( right ) springs into an acrobatic challenge to try and win back possession for his side from @entity2 's @entity87 @entity28 was in the wars again after this foul from @entity79 of @entity2 on the touchline left the @entity44 star in apparent agony			1

former @entity41 defender @entity39 was lucky not to receive a card for a nasty stamp on @entity1 talisman @entity28
@entity7 fired the @entity42 ahead on 72 minutes , rounding @entity2 keeper @entity37 to slot home
