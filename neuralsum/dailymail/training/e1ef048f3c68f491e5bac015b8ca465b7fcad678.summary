@entity12 found the books and magazines in car boot sales and a recycling centre , added the signature and then sold them on @entity18 as the real thing , @entity11 @entity10 heard			1
he made thousands of pounds defrauding collectors from as far afield as @entity22 in the @entity23 after also lying about the provenance of the items , the court was told			0
duped : @entity12 found books and magazines and faked the signatures of @entity7 ( left ) to sell them on to unsuspecting collectors , a court heard			1
the signature of @entity32 ( right ) was found in his home			2
police found the forged signatures of @entity37 , @entity32 and @entity38 among others when his home was searched , prosecutors said			1
the 66 - year - old is accused of selling 68 items bearing @entity7 ’s alleged false signature at a cost of £ 10,000 to one collector , @entity44			1
he claimed in emails they came from the home of famous @entity49 fighter ace squadron leader @entity48 , who lived near him in @entity51 - on - sea , @entity52 , and was a friend of @entity7 who had died in 2007 , @entity54 , prosecuting , told the jury			2
@entity12 , who denies 15 counts of fraud from 2009 to 2011 , told mr @entity44 and others that he got the books from the house of @entity61 via an ' old couple ' who used to clean for him			2
' what we say is that the defendant acquired books by famous authors , he forged a signature inside the book , usually that of the author or authoress , and sold them as the genuine article - it ’s as simple as that , ' mr @entity65 told the jury			2
' you will hear that in some instances he invented stories to tell the hapless buyer to boost what is known in the trade as the provenance , or history , of the book			0
' the buyers were fooled into thinking what they were buying was the real thing signed by the authors or authoress and , needless to say , the price they paid for the books was enhanced by the presence of the author ’s signature in the book			0
' historic : @entity37 's ( @entity103 statue , left ) and @entity8 's ( right ) forged signatures also on appeared on documents found in mr @entity12 ' home , @entity11 @entity10 was told in november 2010 , mr @entity44 , who had been ' hooked ' by @entity12 ’s email explanations and merchandise , had some of his items examined by an expert in @entity7 books called @entity113			1
' a number of items were left with him overnight			0
he called mr @entity44 the next day with the ghastly news that each and every @entity7 signature was a fake , ' mr @entity65 told the court			2
mr @entity44 immediately called @entity121 for a refund and was told the ' old couple ' he had got the books from had moved and he was trying to track them down			0
mr @entity44 then received an email in february 2011 from @entity12 ’s son saying his father was very ill and would not be in contact with the old couple			0
the jury heard that others including @entity132 bought @entity7 books with alleged fake signatures for around £ 2,500 during 2009 and 2010 all purporting to be from the home of @entity61			1
@entity12 also offered for sale bound volumes of the @entity138 , apparently signed by @entity7			1
another alleged victim , @entity139 , bought autographed copies of @entity141 ’ entertainments and ballads by @entity8 for about £ 300			2
she then paid him for more signed books by @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 for a further £ 967			0
all were fake signatures , mr @entity65 said			0
after @entity12 was arrested in february last year his home was searched			2
' the search revealed a huge amount of material including a number of autograph books and papers containing forged signatures ranging from @entity7 to @entity157 and @entity32 to @entity38 , ' mr @entity65 said			1
' there were books with forged signatures of the authors @entity162 , @entity8 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
none were genuine , needless to say			0
another one : @entity38 's forged signature was also on some of the documents in his home , the court heard			1
@entity171 is actress @entity172 in her role as the @entity175 queen in the 2005 movie ' there was a calligraphy pen and a bottle of chestnut brown ink found among the papers and books , ' the barrister told the jury			0
@entity12 had got the @entity138 from the @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity52 , before christmas 2010 and it did not have any @entity7 signature on it , the court heard			1
' when they were later discovered at mr @entity12 ’s home during the police search they had miraculously acquired the apparent signature of @entity7 , ' mr @entity65 said			1
when interviewed , @entity12 told officers he got the books from @entity197 and @entity198 car boot sales in @entity200 and he denied being responsible for the signatures			1
he said a couple called @entity203 and @entity204 would buy items for him and sell them on , and the jury would hear evidence that formhalls specifically asked them to find books by @entity7 printed when he was alive			2
' this , of course , was necessary : if they were published after his death then they could not bear his genuine signature could they ? ' mr @entity65 said			0
' he said he was not an expert on books and advertised them as signed , as opposed to signed by			0
he believed them to be genuine but he did not advertise them for sale as such or guarantee them as such , ' the barrister went on			0
he then told police he got the @entity7 books from the old couple called @entity228 and @entity229 , who had cleaned for @entity61			0
in later prepared statements he called the old couple @entity232 and @entity233 , the court heard			0
