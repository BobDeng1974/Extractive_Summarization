@entity17 : hooked : a fisherman caught the huge hammerhead from the pier at @entity11 clear the water : swimmers crowded the beach as the hammerhead was pulled ashore team effort : @entity6 and friends pull the huge fish ashore so they can cut the fishing line from its mouth the main reason for dragging the beast ashore was n't glory , though , it was to cut the fishing line			1
@entity6 told reporters that it 's important to cut the line as close as possible to the creature 's mouth so that it did n't get caught on something and injure the shark			1
' in order to release the fish on the pier , you would end up having to cut the line , and there would be about 15 foot of line tangling , hanging down from the fish , which would get caught on a reef , could end up killing the fish in the long run , ' @entity6 told @entity52			1
' it is an amazing fish , when they are that big they are old , they are amazing creature , i donâ € ™ t know why anyone would want to hurt them			0
