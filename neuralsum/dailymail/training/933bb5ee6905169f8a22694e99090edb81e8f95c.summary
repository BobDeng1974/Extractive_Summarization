by @entity0 getting up at 6am on a sunday , after a night with a jet - lagged baby is certainly no picnic			1
however as i made my way to the @entity7 studio in @entity8 last weekend , i was fairly buzzing			1
the reason was neither the three shots of espresso i 'd had nor the promise of television cameras - it was the topic i 'd been asked to address			2
' is it selfish to be an older mum ? ' despite my near - visceral reaction that the question is just plain silly , apparently many people still think so			1
a recent study showed that a staggering 70 per cent of women over the age of 55 are opposed to and uncomfortable with women having babies in their 40s			2
are older mothers selfish ? or is it really men who are selfish , for delaying or avoiding children with long - term partners ? as a new mum who had her first baby at 41 , i was slightly wary and unsure what voices and opinions i might find in the @entity7 studio audience			1
the first person i met in the @entity37 was a bubbly midwife in her 50s who had her own twin boys at 37			2
she said : ' i think the whole idea that these women might be selfish for wanting to be mothers later in life is outrageous			0
' unsurprisingly , with a greeting like that , i warmed to her immediately			0
finding ourselves in total agreement , i spent the rest of our precious pre-show time foregoing a make - up touch up and instead asking her for advice on getting my six - month - old - baby to sleep			1
columnist : @entity0 had her first baby at 41 after a rather uncomfortable rehearsal debating the merits of being a sports fan ( something @entity59 found utterly appalling ) , host @entity57 kicked off the topic of older mums ' egoism			1
he immediately sought out the opinion of a male psychologist , ( this , despite there being numerous women on the panel , there specifically to address the subject )			0
after launching into an explanation that we , as a generation of women , have been lead falsely astray by the likes of @entity80 , the doctor proceeded to rattle off statistics about how older mums are at higher risk for babies with genetic problems and defects			1
interestingly , it was only later in the show he admitted - after a very uncomfortable prodding by the host - that he 'd had his own child at 47			0
no mention of the genetic problems caused by older dads then , eh ? the whole debate got better from there			1
there was a fabulous woman called @entity99 who had had her baby at 47 via @entity101 , and excellent comments from others on the panel and in the gallery			1
i was able to reiterate my long - held mantra that the worst thing you can do is to vilify and attack women who have longed to have a baby and not put it off through any factor other than the lack of finding a suitable partner with whom to have a child			1
before we finished , one rather determined and dogged @entity119 insisted on getting his comment on the subject in , despite not being particularly relevant to the topic			0
his point ? that it would be a grave error for women watching the programme to blithely assume they will be able to have babies well into their 40s			0
and that while some women can have babies later in life , most ca n't			0
and that you better get on with it then , had n't you ? on that depressing note , we closed the show			0
opinionated : ' i was able to reiterate my long - held mantra that the worst thing you can do is to vilify and attack women who have longed to have a baby and not put it off through any factor other than the lack of finding a suitable partner with whom to have a child ' after a whirlwind morning spent with excellent minds , most far sharper than my own , i am still left with the unanswered question : does any thinking woman , in this day and age , really believe she has an unlimited amount of time to have a baby ? and does the above exhortation - warning , threat - really need to be said ? after all , study after study shows it 's educated women who are leaving it until later			1
i would argue that these same intelligent , informed , smart women who struggle to find a partner who is a commitment - comfortable equal are very , very aware of the limitations and challenges of motherhood in one 's 40s			1
every single one of us knows someone intimately who was unable to have a baby because of her age or fertility limitations			1
believe me , we have all had a front row seat to that particular pain			0
putting it off : ' i would argue that these same intelligent , informed , smart women who struggle to find a partner who is a commitment - comfortable equal are very , very aware of the limitations and challenges of motherhood in one 's 40s ' it is indeed true that more women are having babies later in life than ever before			2
they are willing to try gruelling hormone injections , invasive procedures , bizarre diets , painful emotional rollercoasters , selecting sperm and egg donors , horrendous adoption red tape and sometimes near financial ruin			0
what they are not willing to do is to walk away from the dream of being a mother just because it 's bloody hard			2
if your goal is to encourage women in their 20s to be mindful of their fertility , i salute you			0
indeed , let 's all help younger women be aware of how they can preserve this very important part of their womanhood			2
however , i do n't believe they were the ones tuning into the show for this particular topic yesterday			0
and please , let 's be a bit more sensitive to the women who are now in the thick of the fight			2
for the most part , and for the women of my generation , it has been a challenge to find men who are not reluctant to commit until their late 30s and 40s			0
and , at that time , they are no longer looking for a peer but seeking an ' under 30 ' because , as i was told many times myself at 36 : ' why would i want a women my own age ? i want to have kids			0
' looking back and reflecting on the @entity7 , i believe a better topic might have been , ' is it selfish to be an older dad ? ' or perhaps even bette : ' is it selfish for @entity236 to delay or avoid fatherhood and commitment with a long - term partner ? '			1
