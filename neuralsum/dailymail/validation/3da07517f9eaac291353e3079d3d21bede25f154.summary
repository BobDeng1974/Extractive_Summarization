how @entity2 manager @entity1 must wish he had this group of legends to call upon in his quest for @entity7 glory			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 all took to the @entity2 turf before @entity2 's defeat to @entity14 on thursday night to celebrate their position as national centurions			1
together , they are four of just six players to be capped more than 100 times by @entity21 , with @entity1 another and all - time leader @entity23 making up the list			2
( left - right ) @entity10 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 celebrate 100 caps for @entity2 the group are just four of the six players to have appeared more than 100 times for @entity2 @entity8 ( left ) shares a joke on the @entity2 pitch with former international team - mate @entity9 all four players are also @entity30 and @entity32 winners with @entity2 @entity23 - 142 caps @entity8 - 123 @entity9 - 116 @entity10 - 108 @entity11 - 107 @entity1 - 103 @entity23 possesses 142 caps , with @entity8 second on 123 and defender @entity9 third with 116			1
@entity10 is next up with 108 , then @entity11 on 107 and finally current boss @entity37 on 103			0
and of the six , four started the @entity41 final on the same @entity43 pitch where they became champions , while @entity11 came off the bench during the 3 - 0 triumph and @entity8 was an unused substitute - although he was @entity2 's top scorer in the tournament with three goals			2
all six of them also started the final as @entity2 beat @entity52 2 - 1 in extra-time to win @entity54			0
@entity2 coach @entity1 ( left ) is another national centurion as they were honoured alongside @entity58 president @entity57 ( third left ) and @entity60 president @entity59 ( third right ) ( top row ) @entity8 , @entity11 and @entity10 , ( bottom row ) @entity1 , @entity23 - @entity2 's all - time most - capped player who did n't appear at the ceremony - and @entity9 all in action for their country @entity8 , with his ticket in hand , chats to fellow @entity2 legend zidane ahead of the game @entity8 also shared a joke with current @entity2 player @entity74 before the friendly at the @entity2 other than @entity23 , the four other centurions were watching on as @entity78 ' side were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity14 , despite taking a first - half lead through @entity80			1
@entity82 's @entity81 levelled the game later in the half , before @entity85 and @entity86 struck after the interval			0
it was a frustrating result for @entity1 , who kept his job despite seeing @entity2 crash out at the quarter - final stage to eventual champions @entity93 during last summer 's @entity30			2
and with @entity7 set to be played on home turf , there will be precious few games for him to prepare for an assault at glory , with friendlies against @entity100 and @entity101 in june before a trip to @entity103 to face @entity104 in november			0
@entity80 headed @entity2 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity14 on thursday night in @entity43 @entity82 midfielder @entity81 shows his delight after levelling the scores shortly before half time @entity85 ( centre ) then fired home for @entity14 after the interval to give his side the lead @entity86 celebrates making it 3 - 1 for @entity14 on the night as they beat @entity2			0
