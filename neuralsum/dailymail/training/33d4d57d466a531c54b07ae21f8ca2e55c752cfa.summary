psychologist dr @entity13 has claimed the experience of @entity6 shopping is so painful that it sparks the ' fight or flight ' mechanism he added that the experience can also cause exhaustion and anxiety as well as guilt and feelings of inadequacy , @entity24 reports			1
he says people who live in the countryside are most at risk of adverse effects as they are not used to the crowds			1
dr @entity13 told the paper : ‘ festive cheer all too easily gives way to seasonal shopping stress			1
‘ the presence of other people is a major factor			0
other people present a great threat and strangers are more of a threat			0
‘ you can begin to see people who are moving more slowly than you , such as an elderly person , as the enemy			0
it leads to shopping rage			0
’ he explained that in these circumstances , a person ’s heart rate increases , they sweat more and their body starts to produce cortisol – the stress hormone			0
he said this can promote aggression but that it can also make people want to escape meaning some will leave a trolley full of shopping as they can not bear to spend any more time in the crowd			2
there is , however , some good news for shoppers			0
people become aggressive while they are doing their shopping because the swarming crowds activate basic survival mechanisms			1
it also makes some people anxious and exhausted dr @entity13 says there are ways to make the experience less stressful			1
he says people should draw up a shopping list as this makes it easier to avoid unnecessary impulse buys			1
his second tip is that people should not shop while hungry as they buy more food when they are hungry and then end up throwing a lot of it away			0

finally , he said that people should do as much shopping as possible online so that when they do hit the shops they can take in the festive atmosphere in a more relaxed fashion .			2
