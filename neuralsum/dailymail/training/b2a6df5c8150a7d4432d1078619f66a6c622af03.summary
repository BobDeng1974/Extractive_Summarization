ms @entity4 was rushed to @entity51 in @entity27 where she was immediately admitted to intensive care and fed antibiotics through a drip			1
she spent five days in intensive care and had an operation to drain the poison from her foot to reduce the swelling			1
she said : ' i was hallucinating things			0
i thought there was water running down all of the walls			0
swollen : medical staff gave her antibiotics through a drip and allowed her home , but a rash and swelling developed and she had to be rushed back to the hospital by ambulance ' i was burning up and shaking and my heart murmur , which usually ca n't be heard , was noticed straight away by the paramedics			0
' i felt so sick			0
i had pins and needles in my leg , it was throbbing			0
i was slurring my words			0
i had to have an operation to get rid of all the poison in my foot			1
' it 's been traumatic			1
people need to know how dangerous these spiders are - they can be lethal			2
' after her operation doctors told the mother - of - one was that a false widow spider was likely to have bitten her			1
although she is now back at home and recovering , she is sleeping on a sofa downstairs - too scared to return to the bedroom where the spider bit her			1

bitten : the country was hit by a spate of false widow attacks last autumn , and an expert has warned that there could be more bites reported in the next few weeks dr @entity125 , from the life sciences department at the @entity127 in @entity128 , said : ' there are two main species of false widow spider and they are around all year			1
' the young reach maturity in september and october , which was why a number of attacks were reported then			0
' but they have gone onto become adults and are still a threat			0
' he said that ms @entity4 was right to be concerned that she might be bitten again by the same spider			1
dr @entity125 said : ' theoretically you can be bitten by the same spider twice			1
' they can bite more than once			0
that is how they kill their prey , unlike bees			0
it is part of their feeding and defence system			0
' false widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			2
millions of false widows , @entity8 's most venomous spider , have been found across the @entity8 and the population is believed to be growing			1
the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			0
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
also known as steatoda nobilis , it is frequently confused for the black widow , which has deadly venom			0
the false widow was first spotted in the @entity8 in @entity173 , @entity174 , in 1879 , and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity179 or the @entity180 in a shipment of bananas			1
the @entity127 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity8 , having been found mainly in southern @entity185			1
how to avoid bites and what to do if you get one do not disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened			0
to avoid being bitten while asleep , remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs			2
do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight			2
if you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and can not see inside			0
also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing items			0
if you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction , pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention .			2
