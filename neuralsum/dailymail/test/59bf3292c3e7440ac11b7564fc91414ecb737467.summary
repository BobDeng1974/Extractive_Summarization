his primary job is to keep opposition strikers at bay , but that has n't stopped @entity5 from showing them the art of finishing too			2
the @entity9 captain scored his side 's second goal in their 3 - 1 win away at @entity13 on wednesday night - as the @entity14 close in on their fourth @entity16 title			1

@entity5 was on hand to prod home from close range against @entity13 on wednesday night @entity5 's strike at the @entity29 was his seventh goal in all competitions for @entity9 this season @entity5 sits alongside strikers @entity32 and @entity34 with seven goals apiece as well as attacking midfielder @entity36			1
only star striker @entity38 ( 20 goals ) and @entity40 ( 18 ) have more for @entity42 's side this campaign			0
the centre back 's ability to score is a skill that compares him favourably to the firepower among other teams in and around the top seven of the table			0
at @entity53 , former @entity9 team - mate @entity52 also has seven goals in all competitions this season - but @entity5 has fared better than forwards @entity56 and @entity58 who have only found the back of the net six and five times respectively			1
on the other side of @entity62 , much has been made of the malaise of on loan @entity65 striker @entity64			0
the 29 - year - old has endured a tough season in @entity69 and this has been reflected by his poor tally of four goals in all competitions			0
@entity5 's goal return is better than @entity53 striker @entity56 - who has six goals for the season @entity64 has endured a difficult season on loan at @entity65 - scoring only four goals @entity81 striker @entity80 ( centre ) has scored only one more goal than @entity5 this season @entity84 forward @entity85 ( left ) and @entity87 's @entity86 have both struggled in front of goal @entity80 , who left @entity65 for @entity81 last summer , has n't fared much better too - having scored eight goals in all competitions for the @entity92			1
@entity94 rivals @entity87 have relied heavily upon on the goals of @entity96 and without his productivity @entity98 would have had to call upon four - goal man @entity86 and @entity99 who has only scored twice			2
@entity84 's struggle for goals has been highlighted by the fact that @entity103 has been deployed in attack by manager @entity105 this season			0
first - choice forward @entity107 has scored only five goals in a campaign which has been beset by injuries			0
coupled with that , summer signings @entity85 and @entity113 have failed to replace the void left by @entity116 - with the pair having scored four and three goals apiece			0
@entity5 's impressive goal return is even impressive when you look at the figures of @entity113 's former club @entity122 , where @entity122 forward @entity123 ( 15 ) is their only player to have scored more than the former @entity69 international			1
the south coast club 's next highest marksman is @entity127 with six then @entity128 with five			0
@entity122 striker @entity123 ( left ) has scored 15 goals in all competitions for the club this season @entity9 's @entity131 is vying with team - mate @entity132 and @entity65 's @entity133 as this season 's highest - scoring @entity16 defender			1
the trio all have four goals in @entity69 's top - tier this season - three behind @entity84 defender @entity138 's feat 12 months ago			2
