by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 07:22 est , 10 october 2012 @entity1 - sted : a dna sample from a discarded cigarette led the police to solve the 14 - year - old crime a man has been convicted of a violent rape committed 14 years ago after police found his dna on a cigarette			1
@entity11 , 34 , pleaded guilty to the rape and robbery of a 28 - year - old college professor in the @entity15 , @entity16 in 1998 after police linked him to the crime over a decade later			1
the cigarette was found whilst police investigated the scene of another sexual assault in 2011 where they encountered mr @entity11			1
after arresting him for trespassing and possession of a knife , they took dna from the cigarette â€“ and discovered a match with the 1998 case			2
according to reports , mr @entity11 had nothing to do with the 2011 case and was merely trying to get a closer look at the crime scene			1
in november 1998 , @entity37 , of @entity38 , attacked the college professor as she entered her @entity41 apartment building			2
after pushing in through the door , he raped her before robbing her			0
when he found the contents of her wallet unsatisfying , mr @entity11 held a piece of broken glass against her neck and forced her to take him to an @entity50 , where she emptied her account			2
she managed to retrieve $ 800 but , still unhappy , mr @entity11 dragged her to a second cash machine			0
she was able to break free and seek help			0
police say @entity9 was recovered from blood found on the victim 's jacket , left there when her assailant cut himself on the shard of glass he was using as a weapon			0
at the time , no - one was convicted of the attack and the case went cold			0
caught : the @entity66 were able to match the dna found on the scene of a 2011 sexual assault to mr @entity11 after which he admitted to the 1998 crime mr @entity11 was arrested several times over the following years , including a drink - driving conviction and possession of marijuana			1
each time , however , he was not linked to the 1998 case			2
it was not until he trespassed at the 2011 rape scene and left behind the remains of his cigarette that @entity66 could link him to the crime 13 years earlier			0
mr @entity11 was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty which reduced the sentence from 25 years			0
the case echoes a similar situation in @entity85 , @entity86 , where a dna sample from a convicted serial rapist helped solve a 25 - year - old case			1
@entity9 obtained from a scene where a 20 - year - old woman had been brutally raped in 1988 was matched to a sample in the national dna database @entity94 from @entity95			1
in turn , this sample could be linked to two more cold case rapes of which mr @entity95 had been convicted in 2008 .			0
