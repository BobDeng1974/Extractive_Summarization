by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 16:10 est , 19 may 2013 a ban on ' nazis ' attending a @entity4 - themed event celebrating the @entity6 anniversary failed to stop people strutting around in ss uniform over the weekend			1
organisers of the 1940s weekend at @entity11 , @entity12 , faced complaints last year from a party of @entity16 tourists about the flaunting of regalia linked to the @entity19			1
this year figures wearing leather coats and uniforms featuring the ' @entity24 ' insignia of the @entity26 camp guards were again spotted among the crowds			1
sensitive issue : men in @entity30 ( centre ) and @entity32 ( right ) uniform at the @entity11 1940s event			2
organisers asked attendees not to wear the controversial garb businesses in the town were given signs saying ' no @entity41 or @entity42 or uniform on these premises ' for this year 's event			1
the man in the centre is dressed in @entity30 signs warning ' no @entity41 or @entity42 or uniforms on these premises ' were displayed on shops , pubs and camp sites			1
@entity11 is a tourist hotspot because of its links with the @entity56 and this year organisers were determined to avoid a repeat of last year ’s controversy			2
businesses all over the town , were given signs saying @entity41 or @entity26 uniforms ' not welcome ' in a bid to avoid ' unnecessary offence '			1
a participant wearing an @entity26 hat at this year 's event but again the event – which attracts 25,000 visitors a year and raises thousands of pounds for charity – was marred by visitors dressing up as members of @entity72 ’s elite @entity26 as well as being notorious for their ruthlessness , the @entity26 also guarded the concentration camps			1
one of the weekend organisers , @entity77 , said those involved were getting more stubborn about flaunting their regalia every year			2
she said : ' this is a very controversial issue			0
lots of people who come to the weekend are re-enactors recreating military , civilian , and other features of the era			2
' then there are people who come as spectators who are mainly local people but some from further afield			0
' every year there are a few people who come in @entity92 which is nothing to do with the re-enactments			1
' it is just about getting dressed up as @entity26 people			1
' some people find this quite upsetting in what is meant to be a celebration of the @entity102 spirit			0
' apart from anything there would not have been any @entity26 in @entity105 at the time			1
' these people who come dressed as @entity26 have been getting very uptight that other people do not want them to come			1
' they seem to be getting more determined to get dressed up in their @entity26 uniforms and this is an open and public event			1
' so it is just not appropriate – or practical – to vet the thousands of people coming into the village			0
' it is okay to come dressed as a @entity16 soldier			1
but everyone knows the @entity26 was different			1
they were the people running the concentration camps			0
' it ’s a problem because this is a public event which is supposed to be inclusive			0
' the 1940s weekend is an annual @entity4 - themed event that has been running for 18 years @entity124 chairman @entity123 said : ' it is regrettable if they have attended in those sort of costumes			0
it is a tremendous weekend that brings all of @entity11 together			0
' so if offence is caused it more than unfortunate			0
it casts a bit of a shadow over what is a hugely successful weekend which raises a tremendous amount for charity			0
' the people who organise it want to raise the profile of @entity11 and raise money for charity			0
it brings in huge numbers of visitors to @entity11			0
if not everyone is in the correct spirit of the weekend that is most regrettable			0
' the traders of @entity11 put polite notices in the weekend asking people not to don these outfits			0
' let 's hope in the future everyone respects what is being done and has fun in the right way			0
' attendees are allowed to wear @entity16 military uniforms , but the @entity26 is a sensitive matter because of their links to genocide and other horrific war crimes land girls : ( from left ) @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 evacuees : seven - year - old triplets ( left to right ) @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , from @entity176 , in 1940s outfits @entity178 : a group in in 1940s military outfits stoically ignore the rain to enjoy an outdoor snack @entity184 style : @entity185 ( left ) , 19 , and 18 - year - old @entity186 in costume			1
right , six - year - old @entity188 with a group of @entity165 organisers have said there is no law against wearing the uniforms so it was not possible to impose an outright ban			1
this year ’s event was particularly sensitive since it was taking place on the 70th anniversary of the @entity200 ’s raid and included a @entity202 's theme			2
all proceeds raised from the weekend will be donated to the armed forces charity , the @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity208 's @entity207			0
it is hoped to match or exceed the £ 25,000 raised last year for @entity210			0
a member of the @entity26 prepares to shoot a @entity213 jew founded in 1925 , the ' @entity26 ' , @entity16 for ' @entity26 ' , initially served as @entity215 leader @entity72 's personal bodyguards , later becoming one of the most powerful and feared organizations in all of @entity41			1
@entity218 , a militant anti-semite , became head of the @entity26 in 1929 and expanded the group 's role and @entity222 had to prove their ' racial purity ' and were also taught they were the not only the elite of @entity215 but also of all humankind			2
by the start of the @entity4 the @entity26 had more than 250,000 members and multiple subdivisions , engaged in activities ranging from intelligence operations to running @entity41 concentration camps			2
the soldiers of the @entity26 committed many atrocities during @entity4 the concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by @entity236 of the @entity26 thousands of @entity26 men were also drafted to help exterminate the @entity238 of @entity239 , participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where @entity238 from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps			2
they played a major role in the mass murders in the @entity246 in @entity247 were routinely executed or maltreated in areas controlled by @entity249 the end of the war many leading members of the @entity26 committed suicide			2
those that were captured were tried at the @entity256 war crimes trials .			0

the event had people dressed as the notorious @entity26 , despite a ban
they wore the ' @entity24 ' insignia , as well as uniforms
