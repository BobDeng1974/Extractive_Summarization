by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 14 april 2013 there are now believed to be more than 200,000 cases of basal cell carcinomas , or @entity4 , a year , pictured here on the skin skin cancer is a far greater threat to the nation ’s health than was previously thought , a new study has revealed			1
the number of cases of the most common type of skin cancer is approximately double the level shown by @entity18 figures			2
it is nearly as common as all other cancers put together			0
there are now believed to be more than 200,000 cases of basal cell carcinomas , or @entity4 , a year			1
cases of this form of cancer , which is treatable by surgery , have risen by 80 per cent in a decade			1
the cost of treating each case is around £ 1,000 and although the success rate for surgery is high , the cost to the @entity29 is likely to be more than £ 200million a year			1
dr @entity34 , a dermatologist at @entity35 and @entity36 , said he was seeing more cases of skin cancer – and the number of patients are ‘ projected to keep on increasing ’			2
he added : ‘ it is thought that this is due to a number of factors , including people living longer , and greater exposure to the sun through outdoor hobbies , travel and package holidays , and so on			0
’ the research was carried out by doctors from @entity53 and @entity54 and @entity55 in @entity56			0
their report said : ‘ our study shows that the number of basal cell carcinomas in the @entity61 is approximately twice that indicated by @entity63 statistics			1
‘ the effects on population health and on costs to the health services of basal cell skin carcinomas should be recognised			1
‘ resources to prevent , diagnose and manage the disease should be prioritised to help control @entity4 , which now appears to be the commonest malignant disease in the @entity61			0
’ worse than first thought : image showing how basal cell carcinoma affects the skin surface problems with accurately identifying cases and difficulties collecting data mean @entity4 figures are excluded from official national statistics			1
‘ unfortunately , this means that the commonest cancer in the @entity61 is often overlooked by politicians , the public and the media , ’ added the report			0
however , @entity4 is rarely fatal			0
though it accounts for around 75 per cent of all skin cancers , surgery to remove the tumour and surrounding skin is successful in 90 per cent of cases			2
@entity4 develops on the outermost layers of the skin and is linked to an overexposure to ultraviolet light			0
the study showed that @entity4 occur ‘ predominantly on sun - exposed areas of elderly people with lighter skin ’ .			0

cases of basal cell carcinomas have risen by 80 per cent in a decade
the cost to the @entity29 is likely to be more than £ 200million a year
