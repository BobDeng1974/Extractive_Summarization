he reached the grand old age of 96 when he died in 1984 , and was pictured in the original newspaper photograph holding baby @entity14			1
the family , who all come from @entity30 , @entity31 , but now live across the country , got together for photograph of the momentous occasion			0

' i would say we 're quite a healthy family , we look after ourselves			1
but i would say the longevity comes from my mum 's side			0
' my dad 's parents unfortunately did n't last as long so it must be my mum with the good genes			0
' i think it 's very unlikely we 'll get to six generations			0
i 've already told @entity14 he 'll have to hurry up and marry @entity76 off but that will mean me living until 100 , i think ! ' we 're absolutely over the moon though , we think it 's a lovely achievement for our family to make			2
