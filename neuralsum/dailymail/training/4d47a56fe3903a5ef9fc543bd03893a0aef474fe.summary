appealing for help on the page called help to give @entity2 a better life , the young mother wrote : ' i currently live in a bedsit that is infested with mice and mould			0
' i have been here for 3 years with very little or no help			0
' after 3 years of living like this and being forced to watch my family suffer ive decided i ca n't take it anymore , so decided to take action myself , my council seems to think it is okay to live like this			1
' as donations piled in , the young mother spoke of her frustration with the council for not being able to find her a home			1
' people think because we live in @entity50 everything is okay and that people are n’t living in poverty - but the reality is different			1
' i ’ve got mice traps in the kitchen and the bedroom we share is tiny			0
it would be okay for one person but not a whole family			0
' the former shop assistant moved into the property which costs £ 360 a month in 2012 before giving birth to @entity2			0
as the flat 's condition deteriorated , the young mother contacted the council for help and claims she was told she lived in ' overcrowded ' and ' unsanitary ' housing			2
the family have been forced to set mice traps and share a bathroom with other people in the building ms @entity0 appealed to strangers online , asking for donations so that she may give her daughter a better life despite having to set traps for rodents and see her partner sleep on the floor , ms @entity0 claims she was told there were other people in worse housing than she is more than 100 people have donated money to the young mother so that she may be able to move out of the property the family say they are desperate to leave the flat in @entity12 , @entity13 , but had no prospects until recently ms @entity0 - who takes her fiance 's last name , said she started crying when online donations reached £ 500 later this was allegedly contradicted , with another official telling ms @entity0 others lived in worse properties			1
she was then told she could face waiting up to five years to move into a council property			2
but after setting up the online donations page , the family is hopeful they will be able to move out in the near future			0
' when i saw the donations came in - one as much as £ 500 - i started crying because i could n't believe it			2
' unfortunately i could not even message them to say thank you as it was anonymous			0
i ’m so grateful for their support			0
' @entity111 and @entity112 refused to comment but said in a letter : ' ms @entity0 is bidding regularly for houses but is accepted that it is a matter of personal choice			2
' the waiting time for a house in generally longer than that for flatted accommodation			0
' with the registered level of priority and increased demand on housing , it is unlikely ms @entity0 will be rehoused during this period			0
