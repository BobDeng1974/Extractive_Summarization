@entity0 claims it will be ' a bonus ' if @entity2 come calling for his services ahead of this year 's @entity4			1
the @entity6 fly - half has a golden opportunity to showcase his undisputed ability in friday night 's @entity10 final against @entity11			1
but although 29 - year - old @entity0 has won 77 test caps , he can reflect on just two starts for @entity2 - against the @entity14 and @entity15 - since the last @entity4 in 2011			1
@entity0 will hope to showcase his ability in the @entity10 final against @entity11 on friday the @entity6 fly - half has n't given up on earning a @entity2 recall ahead of this summer 's @entity4 given @entity0 's quality at fly - half , centre and full - back , it is baffling to the layman that @entity2 head coach @entity24 can not find room for him in his matchday 23 or wider squads			1
@entity28 is being widely touted as @entity2 ' likely @entity4 utility back , suggesting that even if @entity0 makes a 45 - man training squad to be announced in early june , @entity24 's final 31 - man cut could prove beyond him			1
asked about his @entity2 ambitions , @entity0 said : ' i always hope , but it is out of my hands			1
i have not had any contact or anything			0
' it has probably helped me because i have focused on @entity6 and not thought about @entity2			1
' i do hope i get a shout from @entity2 at some point , but it has not happened for a while and i am not expecting it			2
if it does happen , great , if not ...			0
' @entity0 , who made his @entity2 debut almost nine years ago and has featured in two @entity4 campaigns , is philosophical about the current state of play			1
' @entity46 ( @entity2 assistant coach ) spoke to me last autumn about straightening up and things like that , so i am trying to bring that into my game , ' @entity0 added			2
' but other than that , i am trying to focus on what i have got to do here ( at @entity6 ) , rather than what they want me to do			2
@entity0 says first and foremost he is focusing on what he needs to do with club side @entity6 ' @entity2 play direct , and i would like to think i could fit into that if needed			1
i am more of a heads - up player , but i can stick to a structure if needed			2
' in the past , you think a lot about the @entity4 as it comes up , but not being in the squad has helped me take my focus off it and i am just enjoying my time with @entity6 and not thinking about @entity2 , in a way			1
' i have taken the pressure off myself			0
i am not expecting anything to happen , and if it did , it would be a bonus			0
' it is the first time in my career that has happened , which is frustrating because you want to be in there , but you get over it and focus on what you have to do			0
at 29 , i should be in my prime , but that is the way it goes			0
' @entity81 's immediate agenda will be to help @entity6 in their quest for @entity84 silverware , and that prospect is in stark contrast to his emotions 12 months ago with @entity91 club @entity89			2
it is almost a year to the day since @entity89 were relegated from the @entity93 - the first time in their 103 - year history they had suffered such an ignominy - and @entity0 was to sign for @entity6 just a month later			1
the 29 - year - old says it was tough at @entity89 when the @entity91 side were relegated from the @entity93 last year ' it was difficult then for @entity89 , and it is nice to be here with the chance to win something , ' he said			2
' it is a chance to go from relegation to a @entity84 final			2
' it was disappointing how it ended in @entity91 , but this is a new challenge and we have been building throughout the season			0
' i am improving game on game			0
maybe i am a bit wiser now , and the more games i get at 10 , the better i will become			0
' @entity118 ( @entity6 rugby director ) has given me that opportunity at fly - half , even when it was not going so well at the beginning of the season			1
' he stuck with me , where other coaches may have shuffled me around a bit			0
i appreciate that , and i am trying to repay him with my performances			0
' he has given me licence to bring my qualities into play , whether it is making a break or playing what i see			0
you have to play within the structure , and it is making the right decisions at the right time			0

@entity6 fly - half @entity0 has won 77 test caps for @entity2
but he has only made two starts since the last @entity4 in 2011
hoping to impress in @entity10 final against @entity11
