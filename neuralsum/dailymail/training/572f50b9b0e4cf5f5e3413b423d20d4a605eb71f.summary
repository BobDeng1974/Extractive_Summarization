by @entity0 published : 13:28 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 13:59 est , 30 august 2012 two @entity2 farmers who became seriously ill after being bitten by ticks were found to have contracted a new type of disease dubbed the ‘ heartland virus , ’ according to a study by the @entity8			1
both patients were admitted to hospitals after experiencing high fevers , fatigue , diarrhea and loss of appetite			1
although their blood count was low , the patients did not suffer abnormal bleeding			0
they were initially thought to be suffering from a bacterial infection , but that diagnosis was found to be incorrect when their condition did n't improve after being treated with antibiotics			0
all in the family : the newly identified ' heartland virus ' belongs to the phlebovirus family , which has about 70 members - many of them insect - borne further tests revealed the men ’s blood contained a new kind virus			1
the bug belongs to the phlebovirus family which contains about 70 members , many of them carried by flies , mosquitoes or ticks , and can cause disease in humans , @entity32 reported			1
@entity41 , spread by deer mice , comes from the same group , and so does the deadly @entity45 hemorrhagic fever			0
@entity46 , a senior scientist at the @entity8 who co-authored the study , said that while the genetic material of ' heartland virus ' appears similar to that of other phleboviruses , the particular proteins it produces are different enough to call it a new species			2
the new virus ' closest relative is another tick - borne phlebovirus , called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome ( @entity63 ) virus , which was identified last year in @entity64 , and causes death in 12 per cent of cases			1
possible culprit : researchers believe @entity69 , or @entity71 tick , may be one of the hosts of the ' heartland virus ' another possible relative may be @entity77 virus , a rare condition that has been found in some mammals , birds and reptiles in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
according to the study published in the august 30 issue of the @entity88 , a species commonly found in @entity2 called @entity69 , or @entity89 tick , may be one of the hosts of ' heartland virus			1
' @entity46 said more studies are needed to identify the insects carrying the disease , learn how many people contract it and find risk factors for infection			0
because the ' heartland virus ' causes such general symptoms , it could be ‘ a more common cause of human illness than is currently recognized , ’ the researchers wrote			2
in 2009 , @entity105 , then - 57 year old , of @entity106 , @entity2 , and a 67 - year - old man also living in northwestern @entity2 had reported tick bites , @entity104 reported			1
@entity105 said his wife plucked a single insect off his abdomen with tweezers , while the other patient said he must have been bitten about 20 times a day for two weeks while rebuilding fences on his property			0
epicenter : one of the two patients who contracted the rare illness was bitten by a single tick in his hometown of @entity106 , @entity2 ‘ i was getting worse and worse , ’ @entity105 , now 60 , recalled			2
the men had all the symptoms of ehrlichiosis , a relatively common but potentially dangerous tick - borne infection			0
but when scientists looked at the farmers ’ blood samples under the microscope , the bacteria was nowhere to be found , leading them to believe that they were onto something new			0
‘ this particular virus has never been detected before , ’ said dr @entity133 , a research microbiologist who specializes in emerging and zoonotic infectious with the @entity8			0
‘ this is unique to the world			0
’ the tv station @entity138 reported that the first patient , @entity105 , spent 10 days in the hospital			0
two years later , he is still feeling tired and often suffers from headaches			0
initially , he had memory problems and loss of appetite , both of which slowly improved			1
the second patient , who has not been named , was in the hospital for 12 days			0
over the next weeks , he too suffered from memory problems , fatigue , and loss of appetite , but the symptoms eventually went away			1
dangerous cousin : the new virus ' closest relative is another tick - borne phlebovirus , called @entity63 virus , which was identified last year in @entity64 the illness was given the moniker the ‘ heartland virus ’ in honor of @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity2 , where the patients were treated , and also because it was discovered in a region commonly known as the nation ’s heartland			1
so far , scientists believe that the two farmers are the only people in the world to have contracted the bug , but they are sure there are more cases out there			2
while researchers are working to learn more about the new virus , the @entity8 recommends using repellents that contain 20 per cent or more deet to prevent tick bites , as well as avoiding wooded areas or areas with high grass			2
the agency lists 10 tick - borne diseases in the @entity185 , including @entity186 , which infected about 30,000 @entity185 in 2010 , as well as anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis , which affect about 1,000 people each a year .			2

new virus belongs to the phlebovirus family which contains about 70 members
closest cousin is @entity63 virus , which was identified last year in @entity64
' heartland virus ' causes fatigue , high fever , diarrhea and loss of appetite
may cause memory problems and *persistent* headaches
two elderly farmers from northwestern @entity2 contracted new virus after being bitten by ticks
@entity212 tick *suspected* of being the host of ' heartland virus '
