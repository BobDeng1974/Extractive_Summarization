by @entity0 follow @ @ adamjshergold every team has one and it 's not usually the player you would expect			0
they 're the talismen , the good luck charms whose mere presence on the pitch always seems to inspire the team to victory			0
a look at the best player win percentages from the @entity12 season just passed throws up some unexpected names			2
lucky charms : the players with the best win percentage for each @entity12 club during the 2013 - 2014 season ( minimum of 10 matches )			2
source : @entity21 @entity22 : @entity23 won 80 per cent of matches in which @entity25 took his place in their defence heading for victory : @entity30 won 85 per cent of the games in which @entity32 ( centre ) featured at champions @entity23 , @entity25 's presence in the heart of the defence came with an 80 per cent win ratio			1
he may have only played the minimum threshold of 10 matches in this @entity21 statistical analysis , but @entity23 won eight of them			0
less reassuringly , @entity25 was involved in two of @entity23 's six @entity12 defeats - at @entity43 and @entity44			2
at @entity30 , @entity32 was the lucky charm with the side collecting all three points in 17 of the 20 matches in which he featured - a resounding win percentage of 85 per cent			1
@entity51 had a similar effect on @entity53 , helping them to 19 victories in the 23 matches in which he featured ( 82.6 per cent )			1
spot on : @entity53 won 19 of 23 matches in which @entity51 played a part this season sign him up ! @entity60 always seem to get all three points when @entity61 is at left - back and if @entity60 need any further persuasion to sign stalwart @entity61 up for another 12 months , look at his impressive record of 12 wins resulting from the 17 @entity12 games he figured in this season			1
@entity69 endured a torrid campaign by their standards but they at least tasted success on the rare occasions @entity74 made the starting @entity76 - the @entity75 boasted a two - thirds win percentage , as did @entity79 's @entity78			0
by contrast , some teams experienced that winning feeling so rarely in the nine months just passed that even their talismen have laughable win percentages			0
winning habit : @entity74 always seemed to inspire @entity69 to victory during an otherwise dire campaign star in the making : @entity79 's @entity78 is not only very talented , he 's fairly lucky for the team too @entity91 was @entity43 's most successful man but his 23.1 per cent win ratio looks pretty paltry when set against some of the others			1
@entity96 and @entity97 was n't a lot better - his win percentage was a meagre 26.9 per cent .			0
