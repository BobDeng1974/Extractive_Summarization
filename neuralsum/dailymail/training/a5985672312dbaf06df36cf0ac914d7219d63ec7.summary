details of the backlash emerged after a stencil of a rat holding a sign that reads ' why ? ' appeared on the @entity17 wall , next to the blank spot where ' @entity19 ' used to be			1
it is thought the rat could be the reclusive graffiti artist 's way of voicing his verdict on the row over his original piece , which depicted a child labourer sewing @entity29 bunting and appeared on the wall ahead of the @entity31			1
new addition : it is thought the reclusive graffiti artist is behind the stencil of a rat that has appeared next to the blank spot where @entity19 used to be ' why ? ' the artist appeared to vent his feelings on the row it is expected to sell for around Â£ 450,000			1
@entity40 , owner of @entity41 , insists the sale of the artwork is legitimate , but admitted he had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from the @entity46			1
' it 's been said that the artwork was stolen , and that 's just not true , ' mr @entity40 told the @entity50			0
' we take a lot of care with our consignors : who they are , what they do , and if there 's any illegality we will not touch it			0
' the street art was stencilled onto the side of a @entity62 shop in @entity63 in 2012 and protected by a perspex screen , but disappeared last week			2
the @entity65 have confirmed they were contacted by authorities in the @entity3 regarding the @entity6 piece			1
they were advised that there had been no reports of theft , @entity68 said			0
@entity3 officials had waded into the row after the disappearance prompted a storm of outrage by furious @entity17 businesses and residents , the @entity72 reported			0
mr @entity40 claimed it is being sold by a ' well - known ' collector who is not @entity46 , but has refused to divulge any more information			0
he added that the painting was being stored in @entity84			0
locals are furious about the painting being taken from the wall			2
councillor @entity88 says the artwork was a ' gift ' to his community and has instigated a campaign to get the artwork returned by urging people to e-mail the @entity3 auction website			0
he said : ' the @entity6 appeared last may and created lots of excitement in the area - people were coming from across @entity8 to see it			1
' we were really proud to have a @entity6 in our neighbourhood , so residents were shocked to realise it had been ripped out of the wall			2
not for sale : a @entity6 mural which was ripped from the wall of a north @entity8 shop has been withdrawn from an auction in @entity111 fury : locals in @entity63 were left furious that a piece of free art was to be sold for profit ' the community feels that this art was given to us , for free , and it 's now been taken away to be sold for huge profit			1
i 'm very angry about the @entity6 going - we want our @entity6 back ! ' much of the controversial artist 's work is believed to have a political message , and @entity19 is believed to be a statement on sweatshops churning out decorations and memorabilia ahead of the @entity130 and the @entity131			1
in 2008 the graffiti artist @entity6 revealed that millions of pounds worth of works attributed to him were fakes			2
a body set up by the artist to verify his work identified 226 falsely attributed pieces in eight months in 2008			0
he said at the time : ' graffiti art has a hard enough life as it is - with council workers wanting to remove it and kids wanting to draw moustaches on it , before you add hedgefund managers wanting to chop it out and hang it over the fireplace			0
' for the sake of keeping all street art where it belongs i 'd encourage people not to buy anything by anybody unless it was created for sale in the first place			0
