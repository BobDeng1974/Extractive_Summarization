by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 16 april 2013 protestors are planning to turn their backs on the funeral procession of former @entity5 prime minister @entity4 on wednesday			1
pictured , @entity5 forces ' officers carry a coffin outside @entity9 during yesterday 's rehearsal police were under pressure last night to crack down on plans to insult the memory of @entity4 at her funeral			1
hundreds of protesters have pledged to turn their backs on the former prime minister as her coffin travels through @entity19			1
campaigners said @entity21 has effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law and will not provoke arrests			1
the move is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police			1
it will be seen by millions of people worldwide as the huge ceremonial occasion is beamed live around the world on tv			0
police chiefs said they are ‘ not there to uphold respect ’ and said demonstrators who are merely ‘ insulting ’ are unlikely to face arrest			2
but they faced a backlash from many who questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead stateswoman			0
hundreds of people have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege			1
they want to occupy high - profile points of @entity4 ’s three mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed			2
organiser @entity53 , 41 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , said that by giving the green light police have encouraged others to join in			2
the environmental campaigner said : ‘ it is symbolic gesture that i turn my back on @entity63 and all it stood for and i hope other people will join me			2
’ @entity65 , @entity66 , the architect behind the back - turning protest , said the public nature of the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures			1
he said : ‘ simply saying it is beastly , horrible or distasteful - a point of view that i can understand - does not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate			0
‘ therefore what i am doing is trying to provide an outlet for people who so chose who want to demonstrate			0
i ’m not saying they should or they should n’t , but for those that choose to there should be a legal way			0
anger : anarchists , students and militant far left groups have held parties to celebrate the death of @entity4 ‘ it might well be cathartic or therapeutic for some to do so and one legal way , and the police have agreed it is legal , is to turn your backs on the cortege			1
’ @entity21 refused to say how many groups have asked for permission to demonstrate during the funeral			2
but several @entity103 protest groups that sprung up since @entity4 died have attracted a vocal and enthusiastic following			2
one group , @entity106 ’s @entity105 , threatens to hold a ‘ right jolly knees - up ’ outside @entity9			0
regal : the funeral of former prime minister @entity4 will be attended by luminaries from around the world and is expected to cost £ 10m retired chief constable dr @entity111 said police are forced to tread the fine line between the right to protest and upholding the law			1
the retired @entity117 chief said shouting insults may even be tolerated as behaviour that is ‘ insulting but not alarming or distressing ’ may be allowed			2
he said police will have the ‘ human rights ’ of protesters to ‘ freedom of expression ’ at the front of their minds			1
asked if shouting would be an offence , he replied : ‘ it depends what is being shouted			0
that is the very fine judgment you have to make about policing in a democracy			0
’ speaking on @entity132 , he said police will be ‘ very firm ’ if protest becomes disruption , for example if objects are thrown at the procession			1
dr @entity111 said : ‘ my expectation will be that when you move from peaceful protest into acts of disruption that is where the line will be crossed			0
’ @entity146 , the former @entity147 chairman , described protesters as ‘ mindless bigots ’ but said police have no option if they obey the law			1
he said their actions will not provoke her supporters , adding : ‘ hopefully , those of us who admire @entity4 are too well - mannered to fall for the bait			0
’ @entity4 ’s former press secretary sir @entity159 accused police of ‘ conniving at a display of bad taste			0
’ he said : ‘ the plain fact is that we know exactly what these @entity166 and anarchist groups do - they break convention and they enjoy doing it			0
‘ i ’m absolutely certain there will be people who take great offence and are deeply upset by these protests because they do n’t think it is the way to behave			0

campaigners want police to *clamp* down on protest on wednesday 's funeral
police say protestors will be allowed to turn their backs
@entity146 described protesters as ' mindless bigots '
