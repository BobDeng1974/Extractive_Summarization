parents at a primary school have slammed a decision to take all fish off the menu and ban it from packed lunches - because one pupil is allergic			1
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , sent the letter explaining the new pupil suffers severe reactions to haddock and tuna and a blanket ban was needed to avoid any risks			1
the ban means fish and chips is now off the menu as well as all other dishes , such as fish finger sandwiches			1
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , sent the letter explaining the new pupil suffers severe reactions to haddock and tuna and a blanket ban was needed to avoid any risks it also means that all children must refrain from having fish in their lunchboxes			1
headteacher @entity30 said the menu change was necessary to protect the unnamed girl at the school , but parents slammed the move as ' over the top '			1
in a letter sent to the school 's 415 pupils , she said : ' this decision was not reached without seeking advice from the relevant medical professionals involved with this child			1
' in this case , the child in question will be joining us full - time in september , but is coming in part - time until then as part of an extended induction			1
' she has had severe reactions , not just to the smell of cooking fish , but also when her mother touched her after eating a tuna sandwich ' off the menu : dishes like fish and chips will no longer be served and pupils can not bring tuna sandwiches to school she added : ' this is about the life - threatening nature of the reaction			1
' the school nurse has said it is a balance between a dietary change and a life - threatening issue , and we have to protect the children under our care			1
' that is why we have asked for lots more detail so we can make a more informed decision			0
' we ca n't completely avoid the risk , and that is why we have done additional training , and we are constantly reviewing the situation			0
' we appreciate this is quite a large response but at the moment it is necessary			0
she has had quite severe reactions , and has been in hospital as a result			0
' the reactions so far have been to haddock , tuna and one other fish			1
annoyed : @entity93 , who has three children at the school , said her daughter will only eat tuna parents outside @entity100 primary school in @entity8 yesterday slammed the ban on fish			1
@entity93 , who has three children at the school , said her daughter will only eat tuna and the headteacher has advised her to give dry bread instead			1
she said : ' my daughter eats tuna every day			0
that is all she eats			0
' she likes chocolate spread but i 'm not prepared to give her chocolate spread sandwiches every day because that is n't healthy			0
' the headmistress has suggested that she just has bread and butter which i think is absolutely disgusting			0
' @entity93 added that her daughter has already been asked to eat her tuna sandwiches in isolation when the pupil with the allergy visited the school			1
she said : ' i work nights and i have to get up at lunchtime and bring her over a tuna sandwich and she has been put in a room by herself when i have given her tuna			0
' we 've had a meeting to discuss all these other things she 's allergic to but in my eyes if her allergies are so severe she should n't be in a mainstream school			1
' i know she has every right to be educated but if they are so severe she should n't be coming to a mainstream school			2
' there are over 400 kids in that school and for one child everybody is going out a limb to do everything for her because it is life - threatening			1
' it 's like sod everyone else			2
to me , she ( my daughter ) is my priority - she has to eat every day			2
' if she had a serious allergy where she had to eat fish every day , who are they going to make sit outside ? ' i am being patient but when you are stressed everyday about what she is going to eat , that 's what annoys me			1
this girl is only in two days a week anyway , she does n't start in reception until september			0
' @entity155 , 32 , from @entity8 , said for a lot of parents it will be difficult to find alternatives as children can be fussy eaters @entity155 , 32 , whose six - year - old daughter attends the school , said : ' i really do n't agree with the policy			1
' my child is a very fussy eater and it can be difficult to get her to eat quite a few things			2
' luckily for me she will eat things other than fish but for a lot of parents it will be difficult to find alternatives			2
' it seems out of order making everyone change their eating habits for the sake of one pupil			2
' but @entity182 , 26 , said that she was n't particularly bothered about the new policy			0
' i can definitely see why they would do it but it seems like quite a dramatic step - it 's a pretty big policy , " she said			1
' i 'm not really that annoyed by it because luckily my son eats other things but it could make things difficult for other parents			0
' ' as a school with a @entity199 for children with physical disability , we do have children with complex physical and medical needs in the school			2
' ' this means that sometimes there are minor adaptations that need to be made			0
' mrs @entity30 added that she hoped after more tests by the girl 's doctors , the school may be able to alter the ban to make it more specific			1
' we do understand that this will have an impact on the choices and diet of some of the other children in our care and this decision was not taken lightly , ' she said			0
' we hope that over time , as the child has more medical investigations , they will be able to pinpoint the allergies accurately and we will be able to be more specific about what we need to avoid			2
' i fully understand that it will have an impact on what can go in children 's lunchboxes and if there were an alternative , i would not have taken such a drastic step			2
' parent @entity237 , who has a 10 - year - old daughter at the school with a peanut allergy , thought the measures seemed harsh			1
he said : ' my daughter has her medication with her at school and with her friends they know she has an allergy and they are very careful around her			1
' she does n't want her friends to suffer because of her allergy			2
i do n't see how this is grounds for banning it			0
' if they are going to review it then that 's fine			2
we have been through the same thing			0
' my daughter has been into the hospital and had all the same challenges			0
it just seems that this is going over the top			0
' this common food allergy includes everything from snail , clams , mussels , oysters , crab , lobster , shrimp , prawn , cod and salmon			0
typical symptoms include nausea , diarrhoea , abdominal cramps , wheezing , flushing , rashes and dramatic swelling of the airways			0
some patients even report that the smell of seafood during cooking causes a problem			0
in severe cases , food allergies can cause an anaphylactic reaction - when the body goes into shock			1
sufferers should avoid all seafood and locations where seafood is cooked as sensitive patients may react to allergens present in the vapours of cooking shellfish			0
doctors may prescribe an @entity300 ( a medical device used to deliver a measured dose of epinephrine to combat anaphlyaxis ) .			0

primary school in @entity8 says pupil 's reaction could be ' life - threatening '
