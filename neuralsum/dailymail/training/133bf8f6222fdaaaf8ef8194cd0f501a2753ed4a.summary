the former @entity8 host changed the line in @entity10 during a performance on a ‘ family friendly ’ @entity13 tribute show broadcast last week			1
@entity1 , 70 , who has been performing the number since the late 1960s , sang the altered version at the end of wednesday ’s @entity18 , celebrating her 50 years in showbusiness			2
@entity10 is about a working - class mother struggling to bring up a child in the back streets of the city			1
the desperate mum warns her ‘ mucky kid ’ that unless he behaves , he will ‘ gerra belt from your dad ’ when he returns from a night in the pub. out of fashion : @entity1 in the 1960s when she sang the old words to @entity10 and left , @entity1 pictured almost 50 years later appearing on the @entity34 last week but in the version she sang on wednesday , @entity1 replaced the line , which normally appears in three verses , with : ‘ you ’ll get told off by your dad			1
’ the change was thought necessary even though the 90 - minute programme did n’t start until 9pm			2
the star ’s agent and manager , her son @entity41 , last night defended the new version , which he said was about ensuring the show stayed ‘ family - friendly ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 loves the song and she thought it was an evocative and appropriate ending for the show			0
we changed the line about belting because we thought it was important to bring the lyrics up to date			1
no one advocates people taking a belt to their children today , obviously			0
it is just not appropriate			0
it may have been acceptable when the song first came out but it is n’t today			0
’ @entity1 released the folk song as the b - side to her 1969 hit conversations			0
but many fans , particularly in her native @entity10 , preferred the track to the a-side and the singer has embraced it ever since			2
a spokesman for @entity13 last night said the star and the broadcaster had agreed to amend the song			0
‘ @entity1 felt some of the sentiment could have been made more relevant for today , ’ he said			2
‘ she discussed it with everyone and there was a feeling it was the right way to go			0

former blind date host changed a line of the @entity10 during a performance to make it more ' family friendly '
