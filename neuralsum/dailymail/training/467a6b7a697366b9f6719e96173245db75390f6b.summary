the stunning treasures from a sunken @entity2 galleon have been revealed for the first time after the ship was rediscovered nearly 400 years on from its wreck in the @entity6			1
the loss of the @entity8 along with seven other ships destroyed the @entity10 - and even contributed to the collapse of the @entity12			1
now deep - sea divers believe they have found its wreck 400m deep , with 17,000 objects on board revealing that it was carrying gold , pearls - and even parrots			1
treasure : some of the 27 gold bars recovered from the wreck of @entity8 unique : these pearls are from a rare species of oyster found in seabeds off the coast of @entity30 precious : the loss of the treasure , such as this chain weighing half a kilogram , devastated @entity2 's economy @entity36 : this image of 16th - century @entity38 shows a ship similar to that lost in the @entity6 the discovery unveiled today gives a fascinating glimpse into the sometimes unexpected treasures which made the colonial economy run			1
the wreck site , around 400 miles from the @entity46 , contains 39 gold bars , and nearly 1,200 silver pieces of eight			2
more unusually , the site features more than 6,600 pearls being exported to @entity51 from the coast of @entity30			2
the gems came from a type of oyster which was unique to @entity56 but which was nearly extinct by the early 17th century thanks to over-exploitation by colonial traders			2
bullion : a gold bar stamps with official marks certifying its purity and taxation status vessels : these ceramic jars and tableware were used to furnish the doomed ship on its voyage precious : a selection of the jewels and precious stones being transported from the @entity72 to the @entity73 cash : silver coins apparently mined in the colonies and taken back to @entity2 to prop up the ruling power certificate : a stamp reading ' en rada ' operating as a sort of guarantee of the gold 's origin and it was not only wildlife to suffer from the oyster trade - 60,000 @entity86 natives are believed to have died while diving for pearls on behalf of the @entity2			2
in addition to the precious metals and jewels , two bird 's bones were found at the site , thought to have come from a blue - headed parrot			0
the parrots made popular pets because of their bright plumage and ability to mimic human speech , but this is the first time the remains of one have been found in a shipwreck			1
another glimpse of everyday life in the early modern world comes from a tortoiseshell comb for lice apparently made by a member of the ship 's crew			0
jar : the artefacts found by the @entity117 expedition have not been seen for nearly 400 years @entity118 : this was used to navigate by the stars but did not help the ship avoid a devastating hurricane riches : but the empire was deep in debt and the wreck of its ships contributed to its downfall examination : an archaeologist holding silver retrieved from the wreck 400m deep in the @entity6 the @entity8 @entity133 y @entity8 was one of a fleet of 28 @entity2 merchants hit by a hurricane on september 5 , 1622			1
eight were sunk , killing 500 people on board and hiding their treasure for nearly four centuries			0
the @entity2 economy had been relying on the boost it would have received from the ships ' arrival , and the disaster contributed to the eventual downfall of the formerly all - powerful colonial empire			0
to the rescue : the @entity150 moored over the site of the shipwreck delicate : cutting - edge technology was used to retrieve the valuable treasures from the seabed handle with care : team members examine containers full of ceramic jars from the @entity133 machinery : this filtration system designed to sift small finds was specially designed for the expedition excavations at the site of the wreck have been going on for more than 20 years , using deep - sea technology developed by @entity168 engineers to drill for oil in the @entity170			1
they were carried out by @entity172 , whose president @entity173 told @entity175 : ' this is the major find of our time			0
' the objects excavated from the @entity8 are going on display at the company 's headquarters in @entity183			0
@entity117 , a book on the shipwreck and its contents , is published today by @entity187			0
find : the site of the shipwreck is around 400 miles away from the @entity46 dark legacy : an early modern engraving of african slaves at work in the silver mines of @entity194			0

@entity196 destroyed during storm in 1622
