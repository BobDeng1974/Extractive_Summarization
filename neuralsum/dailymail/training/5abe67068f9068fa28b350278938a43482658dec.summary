by @entity0 when you think of feminist literature , @entity2 's works or @entity4 ’s recent hit @entity5 might spring to mind			0
you may be less likely to consider a publication that ’s pink all over with puppy dogs on the cover and hearts and flowers on every page			0
but that ’s exactly the format of the latest feminist offering , hoping to make a positive stamp on the malleable minds of our nation ’s young girls			0
new direction : girl talk has reevaluated its content after ' unsettling ' survey results role model : @entity29 was voted the most admired celebrity by @entity25 readers @entity25 magazine , which is aimed at 7 - 10 - year - olds , has re-launched with a new feminist ethos in response to a new poll carried out by the magazine to mark their 500th issue			1
the results , which tapped into the mind - set of the magazine ’s 376,000 readers , are described by the magazine 's editor @entity43 as ‘ unsettling , if not surprising ’			1
with the exception of children ’s writer @entity46 , the top 10 most admired celebrities were all singers or actors			1
the latest issue of @entity51 , which launches their # girlsareamazing campaign , which carries with it an underlying editorial proimise sportswomen , politicians and businesswomen barely registered on the list			1
@entity60 @entity29 was voted ‘ most admired celebrity ’ by readers , followed by fellow chart regulars @entity64 in second place , and @entity66 in third position			1
the survey also revealed an overwhelming 80 per cent of young girls wanted to be referred to as ‘ pretty ’ , ‘ kind ’ and ‘ funny ’ , with only 20 per cent choosing ‘ clever ’ , ‘ strong ’ or ‘ brave ’ as important attributes			1
more than a third of girls aspired to jobs in showbiz and their top 10 career choices were either artistic , performing or caring – all in roles traditionally thought of as feminine			2
the poll prompted the magazine to reevaluate its content and launch # girlsareamazing campaign , which aims to broaden ambition in young girls			2
‘ so much is said about the media having a bad effect on girls , so we had to really look at ourselves and make sure our influence is positive , ’ @entity43 told @entity82			0
‘ i would like readers to feel inspired and confident that they really can achieve anything that they like -- and that they are perfectly normal if they do n't feel dainty , girly and sweet			2
’ as a result , all scantily clad pop - stars are banned from their pages			1
instead you ’ll find a broader range of role models			0
‘ in every issue we have career profiles of women with less typically female jobs			0
so far we have had a woman pilot , a nuclear safety scientist , comic book artist , racing car diver and in the next issue a female coder , ' @entity43 says			0
positive change : @entity113 , pictured after winning gold at @entity112 , will be featured more in @entity25 girls rock ! : readers ( left ) and @entity25 editor @entity43 ( right ) model # @entity117 t - shirts in support of the campaign to empower young girls and broaden their ambitions ‘ our posters have changed too - instead of just one direction and @entity64 , we now have sportswomen and powerful characters from films and tv			1
‘ every issue we have a full page profile of our hero of the fortnight - people like children ’s writer @entity46 and sportswomen @entity134 and @entity113			1
‘ we also have stories about girls who have done amazing things , like @entity138 , and opinion pieces from readers			2
' equally important to the type of content the magazine is planning on upping is the type of content they promise to exclude			1
inspiring : the magazine will feature more stories ' about girls who have done amazing things ' such as @entity138 - pictured being applauded by members of the @entity152 new leaf : @entity25 's pages will now include more images of ' positive role models ' such as @entity134 the mantra , which appears on the first page of every issue , reads : ‘ we do n't talk about boyfriends , sex , puberty or anything inappropriate for our age group			1
‘ our core readers are 9 - 10 years old , so we have to be really careful that our editorial is just right for them , ’ says @entity43			1
‘ you wo n't find anyone who is unsuitable for our age group in @entity25 , so that 's @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 do n't feature at all			2
‘ and they are n't really aiming their products at our readers either			2
pretty much anyone who persistently rolls around in their underwear or sings songs with rude lyrics wo n't feature in the magazine			0
' @entity25 ’s aim is to instil a well - balanced , healthy outlook amongst readers			2
‘ we want to encourage girls to achieve and break away from limiting and old - fashioned beliefs about what they can do , ’ explains @entity43			0
‘ we want to make different kinds of women visible to them ; women whose success is not based on looks			0
city girl chic : @entity64 , who came second in the @entity25 poll , steps out in @entity198 ' the survey was inspired by a feeling that there was something very wrong with media for girls , ’ she explains			0
‘ there are lots of news stories and statistics about the lack of good female role models , the pressure to look pretty , sexualised pop stars , low self - esteem , girls ' narrowing ambitions and the fear of them growing up too quickly			1
‘ we wanted to see if this was true of our readers and to find out more about their lives			0
so we asked about the women they admire , what worries them , careers they aspire to and whether they believed they could reach those goals , ' she says			0
@entity25 have vowed to ban pop stars in favour of stronger role - models for their pre-teen readers @entity43 said she feels confident the magazine can have a positive impact			1
‘ when i was a child i read magazines voraciously and they had a huge influence on me ; what i wore , what i wanted to be when i grew up and what kind of girl i was , ' she says			0
one @entity25 fan , @entity240 editor @entity239 , even wrote to @entity43 to say her daughter has started a blog because @entity25 suggested it .			0
