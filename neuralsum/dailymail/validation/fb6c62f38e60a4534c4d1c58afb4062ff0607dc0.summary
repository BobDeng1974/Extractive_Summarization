@entity0 believes @entity1 must spend big again this summer if @entity3 's tactics are to bring success to @entity5			1
@entity1 were dumped out of the @entity6 by @entity7 on monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks			2
and former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 , who has two season tickets at his old club , is unconvinced that @entity14 's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad			1
@entity3 gives instructions to @entity19 during @entity1 's defeat by @entity7 @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 ( @entity24 ) look dejected at @entity5 @entity25 was right ! i would have loved to have played with @entity27 ... but only if he always performed like he did at @entity5 writing in his column for @entity29 , @entity0 said : ' watching @entity1 at @entity5 on monday , i know what @entity3 is trying to do with this team			1
i do like the concept			0
i just question whether he has the players to do it			0
' in recent weeks , @entity14 has tried what i would describe as a more @entity38 - style approach to games			1
his centre backs push wide , the full backs push on and the team pass the ball			0
it has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides , starting with @entity48 and the high - pressing game they play , that you have to wonder whether it will be found out			2
' to play this way , you really need to be exceptional			0
@entity38 can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years			1
@entity1 have spent around £ 220m in the last three transfer windows and yet i would question whether they have the players to operate this system			1
' @entity14 has been criticised for utilising @entity21 's height and physical presence at times this season former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes the club must buy more new players this summer @entity1 were known for their relentless attacking under sir @entity65 and @entity0 , who was an integral part of the @entity68 's midfield , wants to see fluid football back at @entity5			1
' i understand what @entity14 is trying to do , ' @entity0 wrote			1
' i like that he is playing with the wide players			0
i also know that as former players we can not harp on about the old days for ever			0
things change , although i believe that certain principles , of attacking , entertaining football , should always be protected			0
' like any other match - going fan – i have two season tickets for @entity5 – i want to see the team play well and win			2
i just do n’t think this system is the best for these players			0
' @entity84 has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a £ 60million deal from @entity87 former @entity89 midfielder @entity88 has found himself out of favour under @entity14 in recent months @entity14 's men are fourth in the @entity93 table ahead of sunday 's clash with @entity48 but they could drop out of the @entity96 places if they suffer defeat and rivals @entity99 win at @entity100 on monday night			2
despite the club 's precarious position , @entity0 is adamant that the @entity103 has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window			1
he added : ' i still believe that @entity14 is the right man for the job			2
i do n’t think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play			0
he is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football			0
but i am afraid to say that if he wants to play this @entity38 style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it			1

@entity0 believes @entity3 is trying to play a ' @entity38 style '
he feels @entity1 do not have the right players to make it work
@entity0 wants @entity14 to spend big to *improve* his squad this summer
season ticket - *holder* @entity0 also wants @entity1 to attack and entertain
