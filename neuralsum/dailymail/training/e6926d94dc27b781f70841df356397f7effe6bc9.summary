some of @entity1 ’s best stories are not always as they seem , in fact sometimes they 're simply a myth			1
from remote outback cattle stations to bustling cities and coastal havens , @entity7 author @entity6 has interviewed some of the most interesting people to bring back some truth to what we think we know			0
‘ @entity1 ’s best unknown stories ’ brings an impressive collection of hilarious and quirky yarns and furphies that share and capture the heart and soul of the @entity1 spirit			1
@entity6 believes there are always going to be more things you do n’t know than things you do know			2
it hailed from @entity35 , based on a @entity35 designed , but previously rejected , post-war chevrolet the ashes vase ( pictured ) does not contain anything to do with cricket but the ashes of a lady 's hat veil the patriot chant @entity44 actually hails from the @entity45 , from a pastie ' as @entity48 ( or was it @entity49 ? ) reminded us a few centuries ago , there are more things in heaven and earth than we can dream of			1
' @entity7 author @entity6 says there are plenty of stories we have believed for years that are in fact a myth ' what is sometimes very strange , however , is what we do know and what we do n’t			2
even more fascinating , to me at least , is what we think we know , but what may not be true at all			0
' @entity6 , who has been a radio announcer for @entity66 for 13 years admits he has a great passion for @entity1 and loves the quirky but interesting stories			1
‘ hardly ground breaking world events but they just interest me because we tend to believe what we ’re told and the truth is something else altogether			0
’ ‘ i tried to think about what would interest readers , we ’re always fascinated by stories , ’ he said			2
‘ if you want people to get interested in something you tell them a story			0
’ he says in life there are always nice stories but sometimes they ’re simply not true			2
‘ we get told this stuff but it ’s really nothing of the kind			2
’ ‘ sometimes its publicity stunts , sometimes we just want to believe something			0
’ ‘ but these days with social media , people are far more aware , a little more sceptical			0
’ ‘ people like to believe the dramatic , i find knowing the truth is even more interesting , quite amazing to know			0
’ ‘ the quirky real stuff is far more interesting than the dramatic spin			0
’ so to start with one of the most obvious myths …			0
. the @entity29 ( pictured ) has long been a national legend ‘ the first car specifically designed for @entity1 conditions ’			1
well , it 's not a legend , it ’s a myth according to history @entity1 ’s car it has long been a national legend that the @entity29 was ‘ the first car specifically designed for @entity1 conditions ’			1
well , that ’s not a legend , it ’s a myth			2
during @entity110 the government , along with both @entity109 and @entity29 , explored the possibility of a locally produced affordable motorcar			1
the @entity113 began life in 1856 as saddle and harness makers			0
in 1908 the company moved into the automotive field before becoming a subsidiary of @entity35 @entity120 ( @entity121 ) in 1931			0
after the war @entity29 continued to pursue the idea			1
managing director @entity124 wanted a local design , while the company preferred to see an @entity35 one			0
the final design for ‘ @entity1 ’s @entity129 ’ was based on a @entity35 designed , but previously rejected , post-war @entity130			1
the name ‘ @entity29 ’ was chosen , incidentally , in honour of sir @entity133 , the company ’s first chairman			1
other names considered were ‘ @entity136 ’ , ‘ @entity137 ’ , ‘ @entity138 ’ , ‘ @entity139 ’ , ‘ @entity140 ’ , ‘ @entity141 ’ and ‘ @entity142 ’			0
contrary to what @entity1 believe , and what we have been told for more than a century , the tiny @entity147 vase ( pictured ) , which is actually a ladies ’ scent bottle , does not contain the ashes of stumps , bails , balls or anything vaguely connected with the game of cricket the ashes contrary to what @entity1 believe , and what we have been told for more than a century , that tiny vase , which is actually a ladies ’ scent bottle , does not contain the ashes of stumps , bails , balls or anything vaguely connected with the game of cricket			1
it contains the ashes of a lady ’s hat veil			1
when @entity167 lost at home for the first time to @entity1 , in 1882 , a mock obituary was inserted in the @entity170 , which read : in @entity171 of @entity173 cricket , which died at the @entity174 on 29th august , 1882 , deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances @entity178 — the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to @entity1			1
this was the beginning of the @entity147 legend			1
when the @entity185 , @entity186 , led the @entity173 team to @entity1 in the following @entity173 winter , the @entity173 press joked that he was going to ‘ bring back the ashes ’			1
when his team won two of the three official tests , a group of @entity196 ladies , including @entity186 ’s future wife , @entity198 of @entity199 in @entity200 , and @entity201 , who had , along with her husband , entertained the @entity173 team in @entity196 , made a joke presentation to him of a terracotta scent bottle , which contained some ashes			1
@entity205 of @entity206 presented the urn to the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) after her husband ’s death			2
she died in august 1944			0
replicas of the urn are used as trophies for the @entity147 but the original remains with the @entity208 in @entity215			1
in 1998 @entity206 ’s 82 - year - old daughter - in - law said the ashes were the remains of her mother - in - law ’s hat veil			1
@entity208 officials , however , still persist with the nonsense that they are ‘ 95 per cent certain ’ that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail , most likely one used in a social game between the @entity173 team and a team chosen by sir @entity229			1
while ‘ bail ’ and ‘ veil ’ are very close in sound and a misunderstanding is plausible , anyone understanding the nature of the joke presentation ( and how hard it is to actually cremate a cricket bail and recover the ashes ) will realise that ‘ the ashes ’ in all likelihood , derived from something much easier to incinerate than a wooden bail and leather ball			1
at least that ’s my opinion the chant @entity44 comes from the @entity248 pastie , an oggie			1
@entity251 sellers would push carts along the docks and call oggie oggie oggie and the miners would reply oy oy oy if they wanted to purchase one @entity44 ! oy ! oy ! oy ! while this is a perfectly fine patriotic chant , and i am not suggesting for a second that we stop using it to inspire our athletes , it 's about as @entity1 as a @entity248 pastie - literally			1
like the cornishmen who are famous for their pasties , the @entity45 have a long history of working underground industry and also have their own local version of the miners daily lunchtime pastie - the ' oggie '			2
the original idea of the pastie was that it contained an entire meal , meat and vegetables , or often meat and vegetables at one end and jam or fruit and custard at the other , all wrapped in a baked pastry cover			0
the miners ' wives would make the pasties with a ridge of crust along one side so that the miners could hold them in their filthy hands while eating their lunch underground			0
the crust was the discarded for the rats which lived in the mines			0
this kept the creatures attacking the men while they were eating			0
@entity251 sellers would push carts along the docks and working areas of @entity304 and other @entity45 cities and call ' oggie , oggie , oggie ' to advertise their wares			2
the reply ' oy , oy , oy ' was a response to anyone wishing to purchase			0
it was a signal for the oggie salesman to stop and wait until the customer could catch up and make a purchase			0
@entity7 author @entity6 says ‘ people like to believe the dramatic , i find knowing the truth is even more interesting , quite amazing to know ' famous entertainer @entity317 based his entire act on ‘ being @entity45 ’ with @entity45 songs , jokes and anecdotes about rugby and mining			2
@entity317 was hugely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and adopted the call of the oggie salesmen as a gimmick to use with his audiences			0
@entity1 entertainer @entity329 was touring the theatre circuit in @entity331 with @entity317 in the 1970s and saw how @entity317 had made the call a rallying cry for audiences			2
it was also used at rugby matches and in other contexts as a light - hearted method of asserting anyone ’s ‘ welshness ’			0
when i lived in a @entity45 - speaking college at @entity344 , it was often used between songs when spontaneous singing occurred in the dining hall ( often rather ‘ anti-english ’ satirical songs or @entity350 rebel songs )			2
while following @entity317 around the theatre circuit , @entity329 decided to tease audiences with a version of the chant which asserted his @entity1 nationality			1
‘ i did it as a joke , just for fun , ’ says @entity329			0
‘ knowing that @entity317 had used his ' @entity251 , oggie ! ' chant to warm up the audience , i ’d parody the chant by yelling ' @entity44 , @entity44 , @entity44 ! ' to get the same response			1
it was just light - hearted fun			0
’ so , there you have it			0
our fine patriotic chant is , genuinely , about as @entity1 as a @entity45 miner ’s lunch			1
not only are there many things we do n’t know , we should never be too sure about the things we are sure we do know ! this is an edited extract from @entity375 by @entity6 , published by @entity376 , @entity377 $ 32.99 , out now .			0
