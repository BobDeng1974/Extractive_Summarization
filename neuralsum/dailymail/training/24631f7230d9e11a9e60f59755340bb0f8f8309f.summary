a female @entity0 minister made a spoof commons speech on animal welfare in order to say an obscene word after a dare at a dinner with @entity7 officer friends			1
communities minister @entity8 said ‘ c * * k ’ six times , ‘ lay ’ or ‘ laid ’ five times and mentioned the names of at least six officers during a debate on poultry welfare			1
her speech , recorded in full in @entity19 ’s @entity18 official report and broadcast on television , received a formal reply from a fellow minister , who believed her interest in the subject was genuine			1
speaker @entity25 was also duped , making copious notes as @entity27 ms @entity8 addressed the @entity28			1
after making the speech , she proudly contacted the @entity51 to tell them she had done it			2
ms @entity8 , who took part in @entity58 ’s diving contest splash ! earlier this year , was accused last night of trivialising @entity19			1
former labour minister @entity59 said : ‘ she should realise that the @entity28 is not a tv reality show			1
‘ the public expects debates in the chamber to be on matters of serious concern			0
it is sad that she has misused it in this way – it sets a bad precedent			0
’ but ms @entity8 , 41 , remained apparently unconcerned , saying : ‘ if i have offended anyone i ’m sorry			2
feel free to beat me up over it			0
’ while ms @entity8 was entertaining her bawdy friends , other mps used the same debating session to raise grave issues such as the @entity46 massacre in @entity47 and the @entity49 hospital scandal the publicity - seeking mp confessed to the stunt while receiving an award last week at @entity82 ’s @entity81 at @entity84 ’s @entity83			1
her prize was for a speech earlier this year during which she uttered the words ‘ penis ’ and ‘ testicles ’			2
explaining how the ‘ c * * k ’ speech came about , she told the @entity92 event : ‘ some of my @entity51 training officers at @entity94 thought it would be a good idea to break my ladylike persona by getting me to yell particular rude words during the most gruelling part of our training			1
making a splash : ms @entity8 , pictured with @entity102 , also said the words ' penis ' and ' testicles ' in another speech this year ‘ they failed , but during our mess dinner at the end of the course , i was fined for a misdemeanour			1
the fine was to say a particular word , an abbreviation of cockerel , several times during a speech on the floor of the @entity32 , and mention all the names of the officers present			2
’ ms @entity8 , who is divorced , took up the challenge and a few weeks later settled the bet in a debate on @entity19 ’s @entity124			1
‘ the cause of hen and cock welfare is raised with me by many constituents , ’ she declared with a straight face as she delivered her @entity32 speech			2
‘ one strutting coxcomb will lead to many chicks and what is to become of the male contingent with not a layer among them ? ’ she could not suppress a grin when she said ‘ c * * k ’ for a third time			0
she went on to discuss the plight of ‘ end - of - lay birds ’ and ended with a smutty pun disguised as a genuine call for action : ‘ let us have no more cock - ups on hen welfare			0
’ ms @entity8 ’s references included ‘ cock crow ’ , ‘ cock welfare ’ , ‘ cock - a - hoop ’ , ‘ cockerel ’ and ‘ cock - ups ’			1
her references to ‘ lay ’ included ‘ laying hens of pensionable age ’ , and ‘ end - of - lay bird ’			0
ms @entity8 ’s @entity51 pals would have been able to watch the speech , on march 26 , 2013 , live on the @entity160 tv channel , where it is still available			1
the mp was criticised last night by @entity163 ’s @entity162 , who has genuinely campaigned to improve poultry welfare			2
‘ it is an issue that many people , including me , take seriously			0
mps are entitled to a sense of humour but this kind of thing trivialises @entity19 , ’ she said			0
at the @entity92 awards , ms @entity8 suggested it was obvious her ‘ poultry welfare ’ speech was a prank , saying her main political interest was the @entity7			1
however , she changed her tune last night , claiming she had ‘ done quite a bit on animal welfare ’ , adding : ‘ i did n’t make the speech just to make those remarks			0
’ the @entity185 runs in the blood of paratrooper ’s daughter ms @entity8 , who was named after @entity7 frigate @entity189			2
she was given a ministerial post in july after @entity192 called her a ‘ parliamentary star ’			0
ms @entity8 , pictured arriving at @entity194 , became a minister in july this year @entity8 first tested the boundaries of @entity197 in june when she became the first woman ever to mention testicles in the @entity200			1
ms @entity8 , who at that stage was still best known for being voted ‘ @entity202 ’s sexiest mp ’ and taking part in @entity58 ’s celebrity diving contest splash ! , brought the house down with a riotously successful ‘ loyal address ’ – the thank you motion to the @entity209 following her speech to open @entity19			1
mps roared with laughter as the mp told an anecdote about her naval training which included advice on ‘ how to care for your penis and testicles in the field ’			0
the sub-lieutenant in the @entity222 , who was elected mp for @entity224 in 2010 , is the daughter of a paratrooper - turned - teacher			0
her mother died of breast cancer when ms @entity8 was 15 – the same year her father was also diagnosed with cancer – turning her into a ‘ child carer ’			2
she took a job as a magician ’s assistant to fund her way through college , which involved her being ‘ sawn in half ’			0
in interviews to publicise splash ! , she told of a ‘ life - changing ’ year working in @entity241 orphanages , before going to university to study philosophy , and that she has a gay twin brother			0
the only mention of her personal life was that she lives with her partner @entity247 – a classical singer , @entity250 cat breeder and director of an it firm – and eight cats			0
a marriage certificate unearthed by @entity255 this year showed that when she was 26 she had a brief marriage to @entity257 , whom she met while they were students .			0
