a man wearing a military uniform and pretended to be a decorated @entity3 soldier at a @entity5 ceremony in @entity6 is now the subject of a police investigation			1
when interviewed by reporters at the ceremony , @entity9 spoke of honouring those who had fought for the country 's freedom while wearing a beret , military uniform and medals			1
but when an eagle - eyed warrant officer viewed the footage , he realised something was not right			0
" ' i did n't know him , so i said to my wife : " something 's not right here "			1
' and his suspicions have now lead to @entity44 confirming that mr @entity9 is not a member of the @entity46			1
mr @entity28 revealed there were a number of small but significant details which gave away his ruse			2
mr @entity9 should not have been wearing a paratrooper 's pathfinders badge , nor the exclusive advanced reconnaissance award			2
among other inconsistencies were that his beret was too small for his head and he should have been wearing a red sash			0
the revelation he was posing as a soldier on a day meant to honour those who fought and died for their country sparked outrage across @entity3			1
it has now led to a police investigation , announced yesterday , that will focus on whether he falsely impersonated a member of the @entity46			1
yesterday @entity69 spoke to mr @entity9 ' wife , who said she and her husband felt trapped			0
she told the broadcaster the couple had been receiving death threats and said she could n't comment on why he was wearing the uniform at the ceremony			1
he was filmed wearing medals and beret , but the @entity3 @entity44 has said he is not a member of the @entity46 @entity9 was pictured at the ceremony wearing an army dress uniform with sergeant 's chevrons and the cap badge of the @entity85			1
to the everyday viewer , there was no indication that anything was amiss			0
however , a number of details in his presentation - mostly undetectable to civilians - gave away the charade			0
mr @entity9 was wearing an airborne pathfinders torch and advanced reconnaissance award			0
these are given to members of an exclusive unit that secure drop zones , gather intelligence and carry out dangerous ambushes and reconnaissance behind enemy lines			0
the course to gain entry is extremely difficult to pass			0
a real soldier would not be wearing a beret as tight fitting as mr @entity9 ' was			2
he should also have been wearing a red sash , as all infantry senior ncos are required to during official occasions			0
mr @entity9 was wearing the @entity112			0
this is an extremely rare award handed out for heroic acts , with most recipients usually well known and celebrated publicly as having earned it			0
finally , as a general rule the @entity46 does not permit its members to grow beards during active service - let alone maintain and groom a @entity121			0
an estimated 50,000 people lined the streets for the public ceremony where a man named @entity9 was later found to be impersonating a soldier members of the public lay poppies on the @entity130 at the @entity131 thousands gathered for @entity5 ceremonies at @entity3 's war memorial on tuesday , the same site where a soldier was shot dead three weeks ago in an attack on parliament			1
the annual november 11 @entity5 honoring @entity3 's war dead took on increased significance this year after two soldiers were killed in separate attacks in october that police said were carried out by radical recent converts to @entity145			1
the crowd , an estimated 50,000 , was bigger than usual at @entity6 's cenotaph and security was tight at the event attended by prime minister @entity150			2
princess @entity152 and her husband sir @entity153 , @entity3 prime minister @entity150 , his wife @entity155 , and veteran affairs minister @entity151 watch the ceremony together in silence the prime minister cut short a trip to the @entity161 ( @entity161 ) bloc summit in @entity162 to participate in the ceremony			2
in a statement , @entity150 said the recent attacks on the two soldiers ' who were targeted simply because they proudly wore this uniform , only strengthens @entity3 's resolve to keep fighting against those who would deny our liberties and freedoms			1
' on october 22 , corporal @entity173 , 24 , was standing an unarmed , ceremonial watch at the war memorial when he was shot by a man who then ran into the @entity178 building , exchanging fire with security officers before he was killed .			2
