@entity1 's predatory instincts and a late goal by substitute @entity3 ensured @entity4 qualified for the @entity6 semi-finals			1
@entity4 had one foot in the next stage of @entity9 's second tier cup competition thanks to @entity11 's all - important away goal during the closing stages of last thursday 's first leg encounter in @entity14			2
the @entity16 outfit knew they were in for a hard task at the @entity18 as they faced the likes of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity1			0
@entity4 ace @entity1 scored the opening goal of the game in the 43rd minute to help his side qualify the home side celebrate after @entity1 's fortunate shot lands in the back of @entity29 's net @entity31 's @entity30 was given his marching orders shortly before the interval for an apparent dive @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 ( @entity41 79 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 84 ) , @entity44 ; @entity21 , @entity1 , @entity20 ( @entity3 88 ) subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 goal : @entity1 43 , @entity3 90 @entity31 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 69 ) ; @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 63 ) , @entity62 ; @entity63 ( @entity64 45 ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 booked : lens sent off : @entity59 40 referee : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) and their mission to seal a spot in the next round was made near enough impossible due to an incredibly rash decision by @entity79 referee @entity72			1
the @entity81 official ruined @entity31 's hopes of upsetting the @entity83 by brandishing a red card in the direction of @entity86 international @entity30			1
@entity72 showed @entity59 a second yellow card as he decided to penalise the former @entity88 forward for diving inside the penalty area			1
the wrong call was made as replays showed @entity59 was slightly clipped when he made his way towards goal			0
it was one of those occasions where the referee should have simply let play continue			0
@entity31 manager and former @entity102 striker @entity100 was forced into taking off striker @entity63 moments before the interval , which subsequently minimised the away side 's goal threat during the second half			2
@entity20 , who has proven his doubters wrong since swapping @entity109 for @entity4 in february , almost doubled his side 's lead when he managed to jiggle his way past several defenders before shooting at goal			0
the @entity117 international 's shot appeared to be heading into the back of @entity29 's net until @entity54 used his hand to intercept			0
@entity31 , despite their best efforts , failed to really threaten @entity4 after being reduced to 10 men as @entity125 's side elected to play the passing game			2
late substitute @entity3 put the result beyond doubt when he ran down the left wing before smashing the ball past @entity51			1
@entity4 will face either @entity132 , @entity133 or @entity134 for a place in this year 's @entity6 final in @entity137			0
referee @entity72 shows @entity86 international @entity59 a second yellow card in the 40th minute @entity20 , who joined @entity4 on a loan deal from @entity109 , came close to doubling his side 's lead late substitute @entity3 came off the substitutes ' bench to ensure progression for his side @entity3 runs away in celebration after doubling his side 's lead in the closing stages of the @entity6 clash			1

@entity4 forward @entity1 opened the scoring in the 43rd minute
@entity31 's @entity30 was sent off before the half - time interval
referee @entity72 brandished a harsh second yellow card for dive
late substitute @entity3 doubled *scoreline* with just seconds to go
