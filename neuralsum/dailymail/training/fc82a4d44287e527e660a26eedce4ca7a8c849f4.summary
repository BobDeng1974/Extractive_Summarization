for all of @entity2 ’s qualities — smart movement , a neat first touch and the stamina of a long - distance runner — he is without a @entity8 goal in a year			0
@entity2 has featured in 30 top - flight fixtures since he last found the net in a 4 - 2 win at @entity12 365 days ago			0
it is , therefore , testament to the esteem that he is held in by @entity16 that he was trusted to lead the line amid a spate of injuries that have decimated @entity21 ’s strike force , with @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 all out of contention			2
@entity2 struggled up front by himself for @entity21 against @entity27 on saturday @entity2 ( right ) outjumps @entity28 as he wins a header during the match on saturday @entity22 is out injured for @entity21 right now and they are having to find goals from elsewhere @entity21 , for their part , do not view it as the crisis that others might			1

a quick brainstorm reveals that @entity2 has now played up to seven positions in a @entity21 shirt - in both full - back positions , across the midfield , behind the frontman and now as an old - fashioned no 9			2
it would be an exaggeration to say that the @entity2 plan was bulletproof and in truth , it is an experiment that did not entirely convince in a first - half in which a direct @entity27 side provoked anxiety among the @entity94 crowd			2
the build - up play which led to @entity97 's second goal for city on saturday @entity97 's ( right ) deflected shot put @entity21 ahead at the @entity94 on saturday @entity2 ( right ) jumps to try and compete for the ball with @entity27 's @entity77 on saturday @entity2 provided an assist for @entity102 during the match at the @entity94 on saturday @entity2 tries to cut inside @entity104 during the saturday lunchtime @entity8 encounter @entity2 slides behind @entity107 to steal the ball from the @entity27 midfielder			1
