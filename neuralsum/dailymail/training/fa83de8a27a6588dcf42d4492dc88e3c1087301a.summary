earthquakes that rattled @entity1 last month were concentrated along a fault line that runs through @entity3 into @entity4 , according to researchers			1
initially , the locations for the series of earthquakes were mapped centered on the former @entity10 stadium			0
however , they have been found to run in a two - mile line north - by - northeast from @entity13 to @entity14 along the @entity15			1
the subsurface fault , which is ancient and has been reactivated , was narrowed down by researchers from @entity18 ( @entity18 ) after they surveyed data from earthquake monitoring devices			1
the earthquakes were relatively shallow and concentrated along a narrow two mile line extending from @entity3 into @entity4 , the preliminary findings revealed			2
the fault line was discovered after @entity18 researchers reviewed data from 20 portable earthquake monitors they installed near the earthquake sites			1
seismologists said earthquakes have been felt in @entity1 because of their location near the surface in the granite basement , according to @entity48			2
the largest earthquake to date measured 3.6 in magnitude and there have been five earthquakes measuring over a magnitude of 3			2
earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel			0
from april 17 , 2014 when the earthquake sequence began in @entity3 and @entity4 to january 23 , there have been 46 reported earthquakes			1
the @entity60 @entity59 plotted the epicenters of the first four of nine earthquakes ( above ) that occurred last month to northeast @entity3 , a @entity4 suburb in @entity1 the january series of earthquakes were mapped as being centered on the former @entity10 stadium ( above ) prior to enhanced data which revealed they run in a narrow line extending from @entity3 into @entity4 some of the earthquakes were located near two wells drilled for shale gas , as well as a wastewater injection well			1
the scientists have not drawn any conclusions from the location of the wells and the earthquakes			0
as scientists continue to investigate the cause of the earthquakes that occurred on january 6 , which were described as ' the largest ' since they started happening last april , it is the first step forward			1
@entity18 seismologist @entity26 , said : ' this is a first step , but an important one , in investigating the cause of the earthquakes			2
' now that we know the fault 's location and depth , we can begin studying how this fault moves – both the amount and direction of motion			0
' his colleague @entity96 added : ' then we can move on to what might have triggered it – examining factors both natural and man - made			0
' sometimes what triggers an earthquake can be very small , so all of these factors have to be considered when looking for that trigger			0
' some of the earthquakes were located near two wells ( above ) drilled for shale gas , as well as a wastewater injection well from april 17 , 2014 when the earthquake sequence began to january 23 , there have been 46 reported earthquakes ( above the earthquakes mapped during that time frame ) the mapping of the earthquakes from last month by seismologists will allow for city officials , if the fault remains actives , to know which areas of @entity4 and @entity3 might experience the worst shaking - as there is no prediction for how long the series will last			1
@entity4 mayor @entity126 has said he is looking at the city 's building codes and a separate discussion will take place on whether they need to be changed or not , according to @entity132			0
@entity18 plans to continue locating both felt and smaller earthquakes in the area , which will help to refine the geometry of the fault			1
the @entity3 area , with a population topping 250,000 , has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early september , according to @entity26			0
about 40 miles west of @entity3 , a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of @entity143 a year ago , causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations			0
residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending .			0

researchers from @entity18 said earthquakes run along fault line from @entity157 *114* to @entity14 along @entity15
20 portable earthquake monitors helped narrow down discovery
fault line is ancient subsurface fault that has been reactivated
@entity165 said 26 felt earthquakes were reported in january by @entity34
46 earthquakes have occurred between april 17 , 2014 and january 23
cause of earthquakes is still being investigated by seismologists
