by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 1 september 2012 fascinating fire maps tracking the shifting patterns of wildfires across the world reveal a continuous pulse of flame around the globe			1
the animation uses information from @entity11 satellites to show the annual shifts in the frequency and distribution of fires around the world over the past 12 years			1
the country has been plagued by wildfires this summer due to unusually dry weather the @entity11 maps - which incorporate blazes started by humans as well as wildfires - are based on observations from the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) on @entity11 's @entity50 satellite			1
the changing colours in the maps reflect the number of fires recorded within a 1,000 - square - kilometre area , with white illustrating the highest amount - as many as 100 fires in one area per day - and red the lowest , as few as one fire per day			2
identifiable patterns that emerge in the maps over time can be attributed both to natural causes and to human involvement			2
natural cycles of rainfall , dryness and lightning strikes are behind many wildfires , while other blazes can be triggered by burning campfires or even a tossed cigarette			0
uncontrolled wildfires can burn acres of land - and consume everything in their path - in a matter of minutes			0
global pulse : active fires are evident in @entity81 and other areas across the world in july 2011 flickering : pixels identify glowing flames in @entity28 , @entity81 and parts of @entity87 in the summer of 2010 satellite technology : the animation was created using information gathered by @entity11 satellites in space shifting patterns : wildfires can be triggered both by natural causes and human intervention havoc : wildfires raging out of control can consume everything in their path flames : the maps track the shifting patterns in the distribution and frequency of wildfires over a 12 year period space agency : @entity11 collated information gathered from 2000 to 2012 looking back : this map from july 2004 indicates less activity in @entity81 than in previous summers intense burning : the summer of 2003 again shows active fires in @entity81 and @entity28 , as well as smatterings in other areas past patterns : this map illustrates active fires around the globe a decade ago in summer 2002 high numbers : the areas of white indicate as many as 100 fires per day over a 1,000 - square - kilometre area annual trends : the animation begins with data gathered in 2000 fire swept through southern @entity24 this week as firefighters battled to bring a raging wildfire - suspected to have been caused by arsonists , under control			1
thousands of holidaymakers were evacuated from hotels and villas on the @entity23 as the fire blazed			0
the @entity28 has also been stricken by massive blazes , with 2012 on course to become the worst year on record for wildfires across the country			0
leaping flames : firefighters can be seen working to control a raging forest fire next to a road in @entity147 , southern @entity24 , in august danger : flames leap above a neighbourhood in the foothills of @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity28 in june 2012			0
