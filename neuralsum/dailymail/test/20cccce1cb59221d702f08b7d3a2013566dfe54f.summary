@entity0 had a good day on tuesday at the start of this second test in conditions that suited them			1
if they go on to bat themselves into a strong position , they can look at it in one of two ways			0
@entity0 can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here			1
if that ’s the case then carry on as you are , but a position of strength is often a good one from which to take a long hard look at yourself and say ‘ how can we improve ? ’ @entity24 needs something different to draw on in his same - same pace bowling attack @entity24 is frustrated after dropping a catch off @entity29 , who was on 32 and finished the day 94 not out @entity24 and coach @entity30 are under pressure to produce a result after drawing the first test the biggest reason @entity0 have not won away from home since 2012 is that they are lacking something different in their attack			1
the whole of @entity0 ’s bowling psyche is about containment , it ’s about bowling maidens and building pressure , as we saw for much of the first day here in @entity45 until @entity46 started to crack			1
that ’s fine and it has been very successful for them but with so much batting depth now , with @entity53 arguably the best @entity51 8 @entity0 have ever had , they can afford to pick someone who gives them an extra ingredient			2
there are those who feel it could have been provided here by @entity60 but by all accounts he has n’t been bowling well enough to warrant selection			0
@entity0 have a good spinner in @entity64 - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back - up in @entity66			2
so perhaps that trump card could come in place of one of the four seamers who all have similar attributes			0
leg - spinner @entity60 could offer what is needed but by all accounts he has n’t been bowling well enough @entity24 speaks with paceman @entity74 , who could be what is needed with comparisons to @entity77 the one i would keep an eye on is @entity74			1
from what i ’ve seen of him there is a bit of @entity77 about him and the @entity85 was a key element of @entity0 ’s best attack of the last 20 years - the 2005 @entity89 line - up			1
@entity77 learnt a lot of the skills that made him the 2005 trump card on the @entity94 tour a year earlier , for instance the ability to gain skiddy reverse swing on flat pitches , and @entity74 might have done that now			1
i do n’t like building players up before they have played test cricket and then quickly passing judgment on them when they are given their chance but @entity74 seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches			2
he is the sort of bowler who almost takes the pitch out of the equation - like @entity77 and like @entity110 and perhaps @entity111 from my day			0
@entity64 is a good spinner for @entity0 , even though he looked rusty after being recalled for @entity45 @entity74 seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches on which @entity0 struggle in @entity0 we do n’t produce enough of that sort of bowler and when we do get one we can hold them back a bit because they can be considered a luxury , or too much of a gamble			1
look at the championship game which has just finished at @entity121 between @entity122 and @entity123			0
wickets fell cheaply to medium - paced seam bowlers like @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
players like that will never have the attributes to take wickets overseas for @entity0			2
a bowler like @entity134 , a left - armer with real pace who moved on from @entity122 to @entity137 last winter , might			0
but will he be trusted to form part of a county attack in @entity141 conditions ? @entity142 was the pick of the bowlers for me on day one because of the fuller length that he bowled			2
i was a bit surprised at how ‘ back of a length ’ he was in @entity151 because i ’ve seen him play in county cricket , bowl full and reverse it			0
he was definitely searching for that fuller length			0
@entity142 , the pick of @entity0 's bowlers on day one , athletically fields a shot from his own bowling umpire @entity158 reprimands @entity0 's @entity142 after he exchanged words with @entity160 yes , at times @entity0 bowled a bit short			1
it might have been a case of coming from @entity151 , where it was certainly not a ‘ hit the top of off stump ’ pitch , to here four days later where they found conditions conducive to bowling			0
i would have done exactly the same as @entity24 and bowled first and even though @entity0 were not quite at their best wickets started to tumble			2
yet you have to remember that conditions and pitches change during the course of a test — @entity151 swung for three days and then did n’t for the last two — and sides have to aspire to a balanced attack			0
this @entity0 attack might be good enough for @entity45 on a day like tuesday but they must seek that little bit more .			1

@entity46 were *188* for five at the close of play on day one in @entity45
conditions suited @entity0 at the start of the second @entity189
@entity0 's biggest *weakness* is a lack of something different in their attack
@entity74 , who is in the @entity94 , could offer a new element
@entity24 's side has *n't* won away from home since 2012
