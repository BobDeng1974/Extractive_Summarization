@entity0 is hoping to emulate his former @entity2 team - mate @entity1 by training his way to a @entity5 cap			1
@entity0 , along with @entity6 , are the only new faces in @entity9 's squad for the @entity10 qualifying double - header against @entity12 and @entity13			1
the 18 - year - old signed for @entity14 in the summer while ex-flatmate @entity1 , 20 , moved to @entity16 side @entity15 in a £ 2.85million move , thus completing his meteoric rise in the game			1
@entity0 says he is aiming to train his way into @entity5 boss @entity9 's plans soon after moving from amateur outfit @entity23 to @entity2 in the summer of 2013 , @entity1 was capped at @entity5 under - 21 level			1
@entity9 was so impressed when he occasionally borrowed him for training sessions with the senior team that he handed the left - back his debut as a substitute in the away friendly against @entity13 in march and he is now an established squad member			1
@entity0 has yet to make a start for his new club and has only recently forced his way in to the under - 21 squad but @entity9 's assistant , @entity33 , hinted that impressive performances in training this week could go a long way to boost his chances of a senior debut			1
@entity0 was called up to the @entity5 squad by boss @entity9 for this month 's @entity40 qualifiers speaking at the @entity42 at @entity43 in @entity44 , the attacking midfielder said : ' it is huge encouragement			1
it showed with the likes of @entity50 , the first time he did really well in training			0
' he managed to come off the bench against @entity13 to make his debut and he has n't looked back since then			0
' i think it shows that if you get off to the right start and make a positive contribution , it can only stand you in good stead			0
@entity15 's @entity1 impressed @entity9 after training with the senior @entity5 side ' it is great to play along top players ( in training ) , it is a great opportunity to be able to do that			1
' @entity0 joked that @entity1 has already pulled rank			2
' he is telling me that he is one of the experienced heads now so i have to listen to him , ' he said			0
' obviously he is great to have around , he is a great friend of mine so to have a well - known face around me is good			0
' @entity5 's second @entity72 fixture - they lost 2 - 1 away to @entity73 last month - is against the @entity12 at @entity74 on saturday , followed by a trip to @entity76 for the game against @entity13 the following tuesday night			2
@entity0 joined @entity78 club @entity14 from @entity2 this summer for £ 3million @entity0 believes he is ready to make the ' huge step ' up to @entity9 's side			1
' i have had a good start to the season and i think i am ready to go in if called upon , ' said the @entity5 under - 21 player who claims his move to @entity86 has allowed him to ' develop further my technical abilities and also my tactical side of the game '			2
' we are spending the whole week preparing for a couple of big games and everyone has got to be ready in case they are called upon			0
@entity0 in action for @entity5 's under 19 team before being called up to the senior side ' it would the best thing to happen to me			2
as a young kid , everyone watches the @entity5 games whenever they are on so to be involved would be out of this world			0
' it is a huge step up , you can see that from the training but with a little time in the training and getting to know everybody that is only going to help me			0
' the manager said he wanted to get to know me and not to be afraid to do everything i can , and enjoy myself			0
' it has been a great experience for myself and @entity6 , something that we will both remember and learn from as well			0
