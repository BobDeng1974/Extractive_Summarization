the problem for @entity1 is that he does not talk a very good game			1
not in front of the media			2
no matter how strategically astute and psychologically persuasive he may be in the @entity7 dressing room , he comes across as dreadfully insecure in his public utterances			1
the desperation for professional respect is matched by an aching desire to be liked			2
@entity1 gets his point across as @entity7 train ahead of the @entity14 clash with @entity15 this week @entity1 also had plenty to say after watching his side draw 1 - 1 with @entity18 in the @entity19 in midweek hence , under interview , the mouth has a tendency to open before the mind has become fully engaged			1
the frantic leaps to the defence of the indefensible , take @entity29 , the glaring - eyed insistence that his team have played well when it is manifest to most observers that they have not , the trumpeting of his own tactical cleverness – all betray that anxious personality trait			2
they delve below the basic precept of a manager defending his players , deep into his own awkward psyche			0
nor is he simply saying what he supposes the @entity44 faithful want to hear			0
fiercely supportive though the residents of the @entity47 may be when anyone outside the red brethren dares to criticise , they are shrewd and analytical when debating their team and manager among themselves			0
to be fair to @entity1 , his side outplayed @entity18 at @entity44 with @entity53 ( left ) scoring for the hosts but the end result was a 1 - 1 draw and the @entity57 face a test in next week 's second leg at @entity60 this is not even as basic as a runaway ego - trip , even though there may be a certain arrogance involved			1
what @entity1 seems utterly unable to grasp is that , often , less is more			1
tuesday night was a classic example of when he would have been better letting his team do the talking			0
we had all watched as they soared above their recent performance level to give @entity18 a good old - fashioned @entity7 chasing in the first leg of their @entity74 semi-final			1
it would have been enough for @entity1 to say they were unlucky not to win and that if they play like this again they have a good chance of coming away from the return at @entity60 clutching a ticket to @entity83			1
he kept banging on about how wonderful they had been , how brilliantly he and they had run @entity18 ragged , that they are back to the form which can win any and every trophy this season			1
or words to that effect			0
@entity29 always had the full backing of @entity1 during the striker 's time at @entity44 so forcibly did he ram it down our throats that we barely had time to open our own mouths in praise of @entity7			1
by the time we could get a word out others were reminding us that the score was only 1 - 1 , after all			2
if this was not in character , we might have supposed that it was the presence of @entity105 in the opposite dugout which had made his tongue run away with him			2
can the gift of the gab rub off even more on an @entity110 , from either side of the border ? well , @entity105 is one of football ’s most animated talkers in front of a camera and the style may well have been somewhat contagious			0
the difference is that when @entity105 speaks there is a invariably a purpose behind what he has to say			0
be it to play mind games with rival managers , unsettle opposing players , galvanise his own team , affect the thinking of a referee or even disarm the fans of other clubs			2
is there some self - importance involved ? of course			2
but with @entity1 , whether he realises it or not , it seems to be even more about himself			1
at least , on air			0
those from within would assure us that this appearance is deceptive			0
@entity1 and @entity7 will wave captain @entity139 off at the end of the season even @entity139 – whose dropping from the last grand @entity143 occasion of his career @entity1 handled so clumsily – still insists that as a flexible coach and motivational man manager his boss is ‘ phenomenal ’ and ‘ blows me away			1
’ presumably , although @entity139 is being allowed to leave @entity44 for @entity148 at the end of this season , that last remark is not to be taken literally			0
it may be of some help to @entity1 to recount how the most beloved of all @entity7 managers also became the one with the most unforgettably brilliant one - liners			1
@entity139 , taking a break during thursday 's session at @entity158 , describes @entity1 as phenomenal the sayings of @entity160 are legend and the manner in which he delivered one of them makes it a favourite of mine			1
@entity168 had just torn @entity7 apart to inspire a @entity170 success at @entity44 and @entity171 was holding court as usual in the tunnel outside the @entity174			2
after some shuffling of feet someone ventured : ‘ well , @entity160 , what did you think of @entity168 ? ’ there was a prolonged silence as @entity160 bit on the knuckle of his right forefinger , as was his habit , and pondered the question			0
finally he answered : ‘ @entity185 , wee @entity186			0
he ’s the deepest tackler in the game			0
’ @entity160 had assumed that anyone with so much as a modicum of knowledge about football would know they had just seen a genius at work			0
so he doffed his cap to the physical courage which enabled best to defy the most rugged of opposing defenders so as to deliver performances like that			0
with those few words he implied sympathy for his own players in trying to cope with @entity168 at his greatest , while taking nothing away from @entity170			0
if @entity53 turns on the style again , we wo n't need @entity1 to tell us how good @entity7 can be @entity160 had also mastered the art of knowing when to speak with tongue in cheek			1
neither would have blurted out the risible remark which ranks as the most foolish spoken by @entity1 in praise of @entity29 – as well as in defence of his own reluctance to condemn the unspeakable behaviour with which the fang - man blighted his talent as a goalscorer			1
when @entity29 was voted @entity221 – mistakenly in my view since the historic @entity220 is supposed to be bestowed for exemplary conduct as well exceptional performance – @entity1 accepted the award on behalf of his absent player by saying : ‘ i am a better person for knowing @entity29			1
’ not all the laughter in that banqueting hall was successfully stifled			0
@entity1 is clearly a clever coach , one refreshingly willing to alter and adapt his tactics , deeply passionate about the game , honoured to have this job at @entity7 and by all accounts a rousing man manager			1
but it is for the rest of us , not for him , to say so			0
@entity238 was one of the greatest defenders of all time - man of the match in the 1966 @entity243 final at @entity83 - and remains the only @entity245 captain ever to raise that trophy aloft			2
so let me advise @entity1 , also , of what @entity238 had to say whenever he was asked about his fame : ‘ if you ’re quite good at something , you do n’t have to tell anyone			1

@entity1 comes across as dreadfully insecure in his public utterances
under interview , the mouth has a tendency to open before the mind has become fully engaged
we had all watched as they soared above their recent performance level to give @entity18 a good old - fashioned @entity7 chasing
it would have been enough for @entity1 to say they were unlucky not to win
not our @entity1 . he kept banging on about how wonderful they had been , how brilliantly he and they had run @entity18 ragged
