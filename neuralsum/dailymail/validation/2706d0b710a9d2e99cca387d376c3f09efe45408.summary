in an interview with @entity207 a friend of the couple , @entity210 , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , @entity16 , pot and heroin substitute @entity216			2
sounding eerily similar to @entity26 's mother and father 's drug - dependent relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on			2
' @entity26 and @entity0 would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had			1
it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs			0
' there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed			2

she was always covered in cigarette burns			0
' their relationship was also very volatile			0
' when @entity146 died @entity0 was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control @entity58 to get access to the money			2
she 'd do whatever he told her			0
' he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her			0
they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around			0
' according to @entity210 : ' but @entity58 really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother			0
she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her			0
