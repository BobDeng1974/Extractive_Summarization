they should have just stuck with the chicken			1
' his wife @entity45 , 84 , said : ' we tried @entity3 only once about a year ago			2

' we wanted to expand a bit quicker than that so i walked the streets of @entity130 to go to a bank			0
' we needed Â£ 100,000 trying to raise the money - but all the banks said there was no future in the business			2
' his company @entity137 , was eventually able to obtain a loan from @entity140 , a @entity74 company which at the time owned @entity142			2
he said : ' they saw how well we were doing and lent us the money on condition that we sold the business once we had opened 100 units			0
that was what we did			0
' mr @entity20 had started his @entity3 business in 1930 at a service station in @entity152 , @entity58 , where he began cooking for hungry travellers who stopped there for fuel , using a secret recipe for the coating of the restaurant 's fried chicken			1
it became so popular that by 1935 the governor of @entity58 made mr @entity20 a kentucky colonel in recognition of his promotion of the @entity74 state			1
