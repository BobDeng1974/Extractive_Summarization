@entity0 insists @entity1 should be targeting the @entity3 title , rather than @entity5 qualification this year			1
@entity1 made it seven wins from eight matches on @entity8 when they swatted @entity9 aside with an easy 3 - 1 win			1
despite the impressive recent run , @entity1 remain 10 points behind @entity13 and seven shy of second - place @entity14 , who have won their last nine matches in all competitions			1
@entity0 ( left ) in action for @entity1 in their @entity8 match against @entity9 @entity0 believes @entity1 can catch @entity13 and @entity14 and mount a title challenge this season @entity1 currently sit third in the table , 10 points behind @entity13 and seven behind @entity14 @entity13 and @entity14 have a far more - settled starting xi than @entity1 , who have suffered because of injuries this season , but @entity0 believes it is not unreasonable to think the @entity29 can catch them and top the table at the end of the season			1
' we ’re continuing to look up and will continue to try to catch them [ @entity14 and @entity13 ] , ' the midfielder told @entity1 ’s website			1
' we ’re not satisfied with third			0
it ’s obviously an improvement and we ’re getting better but we want to keep looking up			0
' it has not been lost on the @entity1 hierarchy that the team ’s resurgence has coincided with @entity0 ’s return to the starting @entity25 @entity45 celebrates opening the scoring for @entity1 in their 3 - 1 @entity8 victory over @entity9 @entity49 heads home @entity1 's third goal in their easy win over @entity9 @entity13 december 28 @entity53 ( a ) january 1 @entity54 ( a ) january 10 @entity9 ( @entity55 ) january 17 @entity56 ( a ) january 31 @entity14 ( @entity55 ) february 7 @entity57 ( a ) @entity14 december 28 @entity58 ( @entity55 ) january 1 @entity59 ( @entity55 ) january 10 @entity60 ( a ) january 18 @entity61 ( @entity55 ) january 31 @entity13 ( a ) february 7 @entity62 ( @entity55 ) @entity1 december 28 @entity54 ( a ) january 1 @entity63 ( a ) january 11 @entity53 ( @entity55 ) january 17 @entity64 ( a ) january 31 @entity65 ( @entity55 ) february 8 @entity66 ( a ) since @entity0 recovered from an ankle injury at the start of november , the @entity29 have dropped just two points - a fact not lost on sir @entity71 , who described the 33 - year - old as ' the best @entity74 player in the game ' this week			1
@entity0 prefers to think that @entity1 ’s upturn in form is partly due to the attacking options @entity79 now has at his disposal			1
on @entity8 the @entity1 boss started with an enviable attacking quartet of @entity45 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity49			1
' that ’s four world - class players you ’re talking about there , ' @entity0 said			2
' going in to a game with those lads in your team gives us a real threat and a lot of confidence knowing we can create chances and score goals			0
against @entity9 they clicked nicely and hopefully in the weeks coming up we ’ll see something similar			2
' @entity0 has been impressed by the contribution of @entity83 , seen here squaring for @entity45 to score @entity79 , who handed out @entity103 presents before the game , is seeing his plans come together @entity106 , ever the perfectionist , was not completely satisfied with his team ’s victory against the @entity110 , which came courtesy of a @entity45 double and a @entity114 header			1
the @entity1 manager was delighted with his team ’s attacking play , but was less than happy with @entity118 for clipping @entity119 in the area to give @entity9 a late consolation from the penalty spot			2
' we did a lot of bad things , ' @entity106 said			2
' did you see the penalty ? it was from our throw - in ... it ’s not possible to give that penalty away			0
' we can improve and we are improving every match			0
that ’s the most important thing			0
' it ’s a process not for one day , but for a year			0
' a penalty from @entity134 to make it 3 - 1 was the blemish on @entity1 's afternoon @entity0 shields the ball from @entity9 defender @entity138 during the contest at @entity140 @entity106 was also unhappy with the @entity3 for scheduling @entity1 ’s next game at @entity54 43 hours after the game against the @entity110 ended			1
@entity0 , who played for @entity54 for two years before signing for @entity1 , thinks he and his team - mates must not dwell on the inconvenience too much , though			1
' going to @entity54 is always a tough game and to go there two days after this match at 12 noon makes it very tough , ” he said			2
' but we have to get ourselves ready for that and it ’s the same for them as well			0
it ’s a game we look forward to and we go there confident			0
” @entity106 will rotate his team for the match in north @entity157			2
@entity160 record signing @entity158 is a big doubt because of a pelvis injury he suffered in training on @entity164			0
@entity165 and @entity166 are out through illness			0
@entity168 ( knee ) and @entity170 ( thigh ) are unavailable , but @entity172 took part in a post-match training session on @entity8 and could feature for the first time since november 22 , when he injured his ankle against @entity61 .			0

@entity0 believes @entity1 can challenge for the title
@entity79 's men trail *leaders* @entity13 by 10 points in @entity3
but @entity1 have won seven of their last eight matches
the latest of those was a 3 - 1 @entity8 win over @entity9
they travel to @entity54 next on *sunday*
@entity106 was *annoyed* with the tight scheduling of the two games
