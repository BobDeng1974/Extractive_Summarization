throughout @entity2 's presidency , @entity0 has served as a symbol of the nation 's real estate crisis and recovery			1
when @entity2 visited @entity0 within weeks of taking office in 2009 , the state was among the hardest hit by the housing collapse and the @entity10 was pushing multibillion - dollar programs to save homeowners from foreclosure			1
six years later , @entity0 's foreclosure crisis has evaporated			1
home prices have soared and are nearing pre-crisis levels			0
on thursday , @entity2 returns to @entity0 seeking to tackle lingering issues and unintended consequences of the recovery			1
he 'll announce a cut in mortgage insurance premiums on @entity23 loans , a move aimed at attracting new home buyers			2
the housing announcement is the first marker for @entity2 as he unveils new tenets of his economic agenda in the lead - up to the @entity45 on jan. 20			1
the economic recovery has been uneven through much of @entity2 's presidency , but officials say they feel more confident that recent signs of progress can be sustained given the stronger level of growth and increases in consumer confidence			1
like other areas of the economy , the housing market has rebounded from the depths of the recession			2
yet home sales nationwide slowed in 2014 , as rising home values pushed many would - be buyers to the sidelines			0
wage growth has failed to match the sharp increase in home prices since the market bottomed out in 2012 , leaving many @entity68 without the income level or down payment to buy a home			1
in @entity0 , home ownership rates have dropped by more than 6 per cent from their 2006 peak			2
new home construction in the state also remains well below what economists believe is a healthy level , with many buyers shut out of the market because of tougher loan standards , higher prices and the lingering fears from the foreclosure crisis			1
the rate cut @entity2 will announce thursday drops the @entity23 mortgage insurance premium from 1.35 per cent to 0.85 per cent			0
administration officials said the move would save the average home buyer $ 900 a year , help 800,000 who refinance their mortgages save money , and draw 250,000 new homeowners into the market over the next three years â€“ a modest increase in sales			0
the rate cut will go into effect by the end of the month			0
@entity0 - based economist @entity100 said the move would ' help on the margins , but it really is n't a game - changer			1
' @entity2 spoke at a @entity104 assembly plant in @entity105 , @entity106 on wednesday on the first leg of a three - city tour to talk up his economic achievements still , the savings would be meaningful for individual homeowners			0
the @entity113 estimates that a home buyer with 5 per cent down and a $ 175,000 mortgage would save $ 818 per year , or $ 14,079 over the life of a 30 - year mortgage			0
even with the reduction , the new 0.85 per cent premium is higher than historic norms			0
the rate was initially increased to raise @entity23 capital reserves , which took a hit during the housing crisis and are still not back to their required minimums			2
@entity128 @entity127 sen. @entity127 said the decision was ' bad news for taxpayers and is yet another irresponsible , head - scratching decision from the administration in regards to our nation 's housing finance system			2
' administration officials said that even with the rate cut , @entity23 will be able to replenish its reserves			0
officials also said the rate cut would do nothing to change the eligibility requirements for @entity23 loans			0
' our action is not a return to the past , ' @entity32 said			0
@entity2 is expected to tout thursday 's housing announcement in his @entity45 address			1
in a strategy shift for the @entity10 , the president is unveiling some of the proposals from the address ahead of the jan. 20 speech rather than follow the usual protocol of keeping policy announcements secret until @entity2 speaks to @entity158			2
the president is making his pre-state of the @entity45 pronouncements during a series of stops around the country			1
he visited @entity106 on wednesday and closes out the week in @entity128 , with additional travel expected next week .			0

@entity0 's foreclosure crisis has evaporated since the president took office
housing is a *bright* spot in an otherwise uneven economic recovery
housing starts have *slumped* nationwide and wage growth has n't kept pace with mortgage increases
@entity45 speech could focus on economic recovery since other *domestic* and *international* policies are the stuff of *scandal*
