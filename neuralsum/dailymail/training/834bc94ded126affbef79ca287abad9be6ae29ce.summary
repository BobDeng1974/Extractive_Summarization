by @entity0 axed former @entity2 skipper @entity1 insists @entity3 should not escape the blame for the club ’s humiliating relegation			1
@entity3 is under intense pressure after sunday ’s defeat to @entity9 but kick - started a major cull of his playing squad with 14 players shipped out of @entity13 just 24 hours later			1
the former @entity15 captain spent the day encamped at the club ’s @entity17 training base as he broke the news to players in a series of face - to - face meetings			1
speaking out : axed @entity2 skipper @entity1 says @entity3 must accept some blame @entity25 and fellow former skipper @entity26 were among 10 players not offered new contracts , alongside @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 were also jettisoned , while loan players @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 were told to return to their parent clubs			2
@entity43 understands current captain @entity44 has been told @entity2 wo n’t stand in his way if he can find a new club and it ’s believed several other under - contract players have been told to take ‘ substantial ’ wage cuts or find another club			1
as he made his way to the exit on monday , a clearly devastated @entity1 insisted it would be wrong to conclude that @entity2 ’ first relegation since 1998 was solely down to the players			1
clearing the decks : @entity3 showed the door to 14 players following relegation ‘ it ’s probably going to be coming out that it ’s all the players ’ fault – but you ca n’t blame it all on the players , ’ said the 29 - year - old			1
‘ there ’s no way it ’s entirely the players ’ fault ; the players had got the club to two @entity72 finals			1
admittedly , we got beat in the two cup finals but we got them there and we finished quite comfortably in the league last season			2
‘ so , yes , blame lies with the players			2
we got the club relegated – but you can ’ t entirely just look at the players			2
‘ the manager said he is looking for radical change but i do n’t know what he means by that			2
if he means the players i ’m not too sure the squad ’s as bad as him saying that but that ’s his opinion and that ’s why he ’s the manager and i ’m not			2
surplus to requirements : @entity94 and @entity32 were among 10 players shown the door ‘ the players backed the manager and wanted to win every game			2
before you back a manager you ’re going out for personal pride and your family , you ’re doing it for them before the manager			2
‘ there ’s no way anybody in that squad wanted that club to be relegated			0
i saw 20 grown men in tears			0
there ’s a lot of @entity2 fans in that dressing room as well			1
’ @entity1 was also critical of @entity3 ’s decision to throw kids like @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 into the pressurised play - offs			1
@entity120 missed the vital penalty to send @entity2 down while @entity119 was humiliatingly replaced after coming on as a substitute			1
dejected : @entity2 were relegated after their heartbreaking play - off defeat to @entity9 ‘ i feel sorry for @entity120 , @entity119 and @entity121			1
there was enough experience in the dressing room			0
that did not have to happen , ’ he said			0
@entity1 , who last played in october and missed a large chunk of the season with a back injury , insists he was fully fit for the last ten weeks of the season but was ignored by @entity3			1
and he said : ‘ i ’m gutted that i ’ve not been on the pitch to help			0
i ’ve been training and been fully available for the past 10 weeks			0
i do believe i could have helped the team out			0
i ’ve been desperate to help them out			0
‘ the manager just said he believed i was n’t fit enough			1
that ’s his opinion , but it ’s not an opinion i agree with			0
thrown in at the deep end : @entity120 ' penalty miss proved costly ' i believe i was more than capable of playing and i ’ll stand by that			0
i had the operation in december			0
there were no complications with my rehab and i ’ve felt as good as i have in the past two years			0
‘ 100 per cent i could have contributed			0
i ’m not saying i would definitely have made a difference – but i was fit enough			1
‘ i ’m gutted to be leaving @entity2			1
i loved playing for this football club			0
i had some good times and i had some very bad times too			0
but i ’m most disappointed that i did n’t get the chance to help this club stay in the @entity157			0
‘ sunday was a devastating day for everyone but we had enough chances to save ourselves			0
