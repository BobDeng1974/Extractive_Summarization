by @entity0 high court bid : terror suspect @entity2 , 27 , who is on the run after fleeing in a burka , has submitted a human rights claim @entity6 - wearing fugitive @entity2 provoked fury last night by demanding up to £ 1million in compensation from the taxpayer in yet another human rights fiasco			1
to astonishment at @entity12 , the @entity11 yesterday ruled the terror suspect can make a claim for civil damages using legal aid – despite being on the run			1
it came as sir @entity18 , the head of @entity19 , told a public hearing that the intelligence agencies had been ‘ sickened ’ by terrorists getting large payouts through unfounded compensation claims			0
@entity2 alleges he was ill - treated after his arrest in @entity26 in 2011			1
the jihadist , linked to the murderous @entity29 gang , is suspected of receiving terror training overseas and plotting attacks against western interests			0
but his lawyers claim he was mistreated by his @entity26 interrogators with the knowledge of @entity37 security agents and are demanding huge sums in compensation for breach of @entity42 ’s @entity41			1
the fact @entity2 is on the run – after cutting off his tagging device at a @entity47 mosque last friday – has not halted the case			1
the terror suspect was referred to in court papers as ‘ ma ’ but anonymity was lifted yesterday following his disappearance			1
a second compensation claim is being made by another alleged jihadist , known only by the initials @entity57 the case sparked incredulity at @entity12 and new demands for the scrapping of the @entity41			0
if @entity2 is ever caught , he will still be entitled to pocket any award of compensation			2
senior @entity66 backbencher sir @entity65 said the claim was a farce			0
‘ the abuse of the human rights legislation has now reached such offensive proportions that i think we will have to consider repealing it in this @entity74 , ’ he said			0
case : the fugitive was allegedly held in @entity26 , @entity77 , in 2001 , four years after he arrived there ( file picture ) he added : ‘ what are the courts doing ? some seem to live on another planet			0
’ @entity66 backbencher @entity83 said : ‘ the @entity37 public is fed up to the back teeth of @entity87 terror suspects trying it on with the @entity37 justice system			1
' it is yet further evidence of why we need to leave the @entity93 so we can properly seal our borders against such people			0
’ @entity97 , of the @entity98 ’ @entity96 said : ‘ it ’s important that @entity37 security services are properly scrutinised , but with @entity2 absconding this case should surely be halted before any further costs to taxpayers are incurred			1
’ @entity2 travelled to @entity26 to undergo terrorist training in 2007			2
@entity57 travelled there two years later			0
both were detained by authorities in @entity26 on january 14 , 2011 and held until their removal back to the @entity37 on march 14 that year			1
links : fugitive terror suspect @entity2 , 27 , pictured left , is said to be know the @entity111 , @entity111 , pictured right they say they were tortured and mistreated during their detention and claim the government is liable to pay them damages under the @entity41 for complicity in their alleged ill - treatment			1
@entity2 alleges that @entity37 authorities knew he was about to be arrested and that this was demonstrated by the home secretary ’s application for a control order against him ‘ as a precaution ’ prior to his detention			1
an order was sanctioned by @entity11 judge mr @entity126 on january 13 , 2011			2
@entity2 has lodged claims against the @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and the attorney general			2
an estimated £ 30million has already been paid to at least 16 terror suspects who claim the security services were complicit in their ill - treatment			2
the cases of @entity2 and @entity57 will be heard partially in secret , the @entity11 ruled yesterday			1
the government denies acting unlawfully in relation to their detention in @entity26 and says both men lack credibility , and no weight can be placed on their evidence			0
caught on cctv : @entity2 entered the @entity145 and @entity146 in @entity147 , west @entity47 , at 10am			2
he was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a burka ( right ) yesterday , in evidence to @entity74 ’s @entity151 , head of @entity19 sir @entity18 said intelligence agency staff had been ‘ sickened ’ by some of the compensation payouts made to terror suspects			2
he said the security services had been unable to defend themselves against the allegations , which they denied , in open court			0
the hearing was the first time the heads of @entity165 , @entity19 and @entity166 had given evidence in public			0
legal sources said legal aid for @entity2 could be withdrawn if he is not caught			0
solicitors must be able to show they are taking instruction from their client to be entitled to state support .			0

@entity177 - trained @entity176 gave police the slip after cutting off his tag and disguising himself with a full - body cloak in mosque
the terror suspect has been on the run from the authorities for a week
it has *emerged* he and another man is suing government at the @entity11
claim says @entity37 ' encouraged or directly caused assault and mistreatment '
questions remain over why authorities failed to act when he removed tag
@entity202 *reveals* *confusion* over whether police had @entity2 *'s* *passport*
