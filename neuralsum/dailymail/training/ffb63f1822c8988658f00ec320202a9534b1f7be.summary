the 10 most expensive signings of this year will cost their buying clubs a combined £ 1.2billion in fees and wages , with the staggering figures only going to get larger			0
but it ’s not always the eye - catching numbers or stellar names which make interesting transfer business in january or the summer			0
here , @entity10 takes a look at 10 players who could conceivably move on in 2015 and some clubs who would do their utmost to land them			2
@entity16 – @entity17 to @entity18 ( £ 120m + ) it ’s been made patently obvious by @entity18 that they are willing to spend even more money than was splurged last summer in the wake of @entity22 ’ disastrous spell in charge			1
@entity25 was n’t exactly cheap , but luring @entity16 back to @entity26 would cost an astronomical fee , blowing the £ 86million @entity17 paid for @entity29 ’s out of the water			1
@entity16 looks as if he ’ll return to @entity31 at some point – the two parties have been unashamedly making eyes at each other – and with the release of added funds by @entity38 , this is n’t beyond the realms of possibility , particularly if @entity17 won everything this season			1
@entity17 superstar @entity16 ( centre ) has publicly declared his love for @entity18 before @entity46 – @entity47 to @entity48 ( £ 15m ) does he owe anything to @entity48 ? maybe not , but there ’s no doubting that a hugely impressive six months on loan has seen @entity46 ’s stock rise markedly			1
the central midfielder had looked spent at @entity47 – a spare part , even making a gaffe when the @entity58 won @entity59 by thinking he was being asked to lift the trophy with captain @entity61 , and not cancer survivor @entity62 , despite only appearing fleetingly			1
but the way in which he ’s ran games since august suggests there is far more to come and it ’d be encouraging if he signed a deal with the @entity48 , especially given they are ready to move into the @entity70 ( and that @entity46 has been consistently asked about that by the club ’s in - house media team )			1
@entity48 midfielder @entity46 ( right ) has proved a hit at the club since joining on loan from @entity47 @entity29 - @entity17 to @entity18 ( £ 118m ) could @entity29 imitate his childhood hero @entity77 and become an @entity26 favourite ? the @entity80 international has set the world alight at @entity17 having helped the @entity83 giants to win the @entity84 , @entity82 , @entity85 and , this month , the @entity86 during his short time at the club already			1
the 24 - year - old has scored a staggering 33 goals in 66 games for @entity92 's side since his move to the @entity94 in the summer of last year , providing 24 assists in that time too			1
however , despite his form 54 per cent of @entity17 supporters revealed that they would be happy for the club to accept a bid in excess of £ 118m for their @entity100 in a survey conducted by @entity103			1
@entity29 dazzled during his @entity105 career and his qualities would provide @entity18 with one of the most potent attacks in world football			1
@entity111 boss @entity110 has refused to discuss reports of making a world record move for the @entity17 star , but @entity18 are n't adverse from spending heavily as they look to return to the summit of @entity116 and @entity118 football			1
@entity29 ( centre ) has scored a staggering 33 goals and provided 24 assists during 66 games for @entity17 @entity122 – @entity123 to @entity124 ( £ 8m ) come back to what you know , @entity122			1
@entity124 would surely embrace his return			2
@entity122 needs something to reignite a career that will – if he goes on at this rate – only be remembered for the barren years rather than the electrifying devastation he previously caused			0
his league record at @entity123 ( after they paid £ 50million for him , let ’s not forget ) was a goal every five games			0
while on loan at @entity140 it ’s one in 10			2
the weight of expectation appears to have become too much since leaving @entity143 almost four years ago , and @entity122 looks as if he needs familiar surroundings safe in the knowledge that he ’s adored by thousands			0
@entity122 ( left ) is currently on a two - year loan at @entity140 after a nightmare stint at @entity123 @entity148 – @entity17 to @entity149 ( £ 13m in january – free in july ) there is a conundrum for @entity152 here			1
does he wait and see , try and organise a pre-contract agreement with the @entity155 , or go all guns blazing next month and lodge a bid ? it ’s clear @entity149 are keen – and that @entity148 ’s future at the @entity160 is suspect at best			0
couple that with their obvious need to bolster in the middle of the park and this is a no - brainer			0
@entity148 is one of the best in the world in front of the back four and his capture would represent a show of ambition that has severely lacked at the @entity173 for years			0
tick him off and the @entity174 are only a goalkeeper , two defenders and a striker short			0
it ’d be a start , at least			0
@entity148 ( right ) has been linked with a move to @entity149 in the past and is available on a free in july @entity182 – @entity183 to @entity105 ( £ 12m ) no other @entity116 striker has scored more goals in the @entity186 than @entity187 up until now and he ’s the sort of poacher many are crying out for			1
none more so than @entity105 , who ’ve struggled going forward since @entity29 upped sticks to @entity17 in 2013			1
@entity193 has n’t kicked on as @entity194 , @entity195 or @entity196 would ’ve hoped and it ’s time to offload			0
@entity182 would n’t come cheap – thanks in no small part to the fact he ’s homegrown – but is a gamble worth taking			0
the old adage is that if a striker knows where the net is it does n’t particularly matter what division he plays in is certainly relevant where the 25 - year - old is concerned ; his record has been exemplary for years			0
it ’s worth noting that @entity187 ’s earned @entity183 10 points this campaign			0
@entity183 striker @entity182 scored a hat - trick as they came from behind to beat @entity214 3 - 2 on saturday @entity215 – @entity216 to @entity18 ( £ 30m ) sir @entity218 ’s biggest mistake was definitely allowing @entity215 ’s situation to escalate to such an extent that he decided it ’d be best to leave @entity26			1
not too many walk out of the exit door of their own accord – @entity215 must be commended for that – but the lure of @entity18 under a new regime , from top to bottom , could be all the persuading the @entity229 needs to return			1
united themselves have missed the sort of driving force in midfield that @entity215 brings and , now 21 but with a full two seasons under his belt at @entity216 , they ’d be signing a more refined product			0
@entity216 midfielder @entity215 ( left ) has flourished at the club since leaving @entity18 @entity239 – @entity123 to @entity216 ( £ 7m ) does @entity239 , at 32 , want to sit on a bench ? no , and he ’s said as much			1
would @entity123 want to allow the @entity241 a move to another @entity186 club ? no , because he ’s still too good			1
so it presents the goalkeeper – who has been the standout stopper in @entity116 since moving to @entity247 in 2004 – with a decision to make			0
he has never played in any of the other major leagues in @entity118 and may want to try his hand elsewhere			0
the rejuvenated @entity216 could offer him an attractive way out , but there ’d be a fair few from @entity254 and @entity155 who would n’t mind a look as well			0
@entity123 stalwart @entity239 has found first - team opportunities hard to come by this season at the club @entity259 – dortmund to @entity261 ( £ 30m ) @entity261 are getting to grips with the rigours of @entity264 nowadays and will look at @entity265 as the sort of major signing they need to make in order to supplement an attack which does at times lack in behind @entity272			2
they are probably one player short in that area in terms of consistently threatening the top teams home and away			0
the stumbling block , of course , is any interest from @entity254 but the opportunity to test himself in an infinitely more competitive league should sway @entity259 ’ decision			0
either way , it ’d make a refreshing change if he did n’t move straight to @entity289			2
@entity290 star @entity259 would provide another dimension to @entity261 's potent attack @entity293 – @entity294 to @entity295 ( loan ) the loan spell @entity293 enjoyed at @entity298 in 1999 kick - started the left back ’s career at @entity149 and if @entity295 were able to pull this off it ’d be quite the coup			2
@entity293 has made just 11 appearances for @entity294 – and none since the middle of november – while an immediate return to the @entity186 could appeal , even if the noises are that he ’s enjoying life in @entity307			2
going back to a club who ’ve done so much for @entity293 ’s career would be heart - warming , even if it were only until the end of the season			2
@entity293 enjoyed a successful loan spell at @entity295 during the formative years of his career			2

@entity17 @entity16 has been linked with a return to former club @entity18 in the past
54 per cent of @entity17 fans would allow @entity29 to move to @entity18
