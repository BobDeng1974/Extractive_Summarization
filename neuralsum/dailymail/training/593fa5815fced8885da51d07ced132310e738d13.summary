a very courageous decision : the inside story of @entity2 by @entity3 exhausted by all the horrors in the world , we begin instead possibly the most fascinating of all pub conversations : which is the greatest @entity11 sitcom there has ever been ? you might argue for porridge , or possibly @entity15			2
i ’m willing to hear evidence on behalf of @entity18 , and @entity20 ( second and third series )			0
but , as in all such debates , each of us has already made up his mind before a word has been spoken			2
my vote , as always , goes to yes minister and @entity27 , prime minister			2
( right to left ) @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in yes minister it ’s easy to forget just how different and ground - breaking @entity33 and @entity35 ’s series was			1
in 1979 , when the @entity38 commissioned it , the sitcom landscape was bleak			0
are you being served ? had bedded down and was in for the long - haul			0
if you wanted intelligent comedy , deftly written and skilfully acted , making jokes no one had made before , you might as well have looked out of the window , because there was n’t anything like that			1
@entity29 ’s @entity51 arrives at the @entity2 as its new minister , and something of an innocent but , as the prolific comedy historian @entity3 points out , there had been something of a tradition in @entity11 comedy of laughing at civil servants			1
on radio , @entity61 had worked this seam in the 1950s and 1960s , and i ’m sure i ’m not the only one to have fond memories of @entity66 and @entity67 as harassed @entity69 officials in the original @entity71 ’s films			0
what no one had done before was pit a civil servant and a politician against each other and use their battles to satirise the process of government			2
@entity31 ’ @entity80 , principal private secretary , sits in the middle of most parliamentary affairs , acting as referee and chorus @entity29 ’s @entity51 arrives at the @entity2 as its new minister , and something of an innocent			1
@entity30 ’s sir @entity86 is his permanent secretary , and runs rings around him from the start			1
@entity31 ’ @entity80 , principal private secretary , sits in the middle , referee and chorus			1
the dynamic between these three very different actors was perfect — but they were enjoying themselves as well : they had @entity33 and @entity35 ’s delicious scripts to work with			1
@entity33 and @entity35 had met in the 1970s through the @entity96 company @entity33 ran with @entity97 , making videos for companies to show their workforces			2
@entity33 had the current affairs background ( he worked on the @entity38 ’s tonight show in the early 1960s ) and the establishment contacts			2
@entity35 , a contemporary of the @entity105 , had the comedy chops			0
@entity33 was tall and right - wing , @entity35 short and left - wing			0
their scripts benefited from remarkably thorough research , assisted by several well - placed moles at the heart of government			1
as @entity35 told @entity3 : ‘ we exaggerated a bit , sometimes , to enhance the comedy , but we told the truth			0
we found that when we invented things , they had usually happened , or happened subsequently			2
the dynamic between these three very different actors was perfect — but they were enjoying themselves as well because they had delicious scripts to work with ‘ most gratifying and astonishing of all , our inventions of “ @entity86 ” and “ yes , minister ” seem to have entered the language as shorthand for @entity127 obstruction and absurdity in government			1
no writer could hope for more			0
’ the story goes — and @entity3 confirms it — that @entity29 thought the @entity86 part was the better one , and wanted it for himself			1
reasoning that @entity51 needed @entity29 ’s warmth and vulnerability , @entity33 and @entity35 persuaded him that @entity51 ’s character would develop over time , while sir @entity86 could never change ; he had essentially emerged fully formed			1
but @entity3 puts to bed the notion that @entity29 was jealous of @entity30 ’s success , even though the latter won four @entity144 for best comedy performance to @entity29 ’s none			1
after all , what do awards committees know ? “ @entity86 ” and “ yes , minister ” seem to have entered the language as shorthand for @entity127 obstruction and absurdity in government @entity3 talks about @entity29 ’s mastery of the character , ‘ allowing [ @entity51 ] to hide behind a carapace of authority but still showing , through those wide , spaniel - like eyes and that gaping mouth , the mounting panic that lurked inside			1
@entity29 did not just show an idea entering into @entity51 ’s head : he also showed it bouncing about inside the skull			1
’ that seems , to me , a perfect description			2
@entity30 , by contrast , ‘ was as fascinating to watch for how he was doing something as he was for what he was doing			1
’ how he learned those long , tortuous sir @entity86 speeches remains a mystery			0
after that , @entity172 would be a doddle			0
my all - time favourite comes from the 1984 one - off episode @entity176 , in which sir @entity86 hears he is going to be made cabinet secretary			2
@entity30 ’s sir @entity86 is @entity51 's permanent secretary , and runs rings around him from the start back in @entity51 ’s office , he breaks the news to the minister : ‘ the relationship , which i might tentatively venture to aver has not been without some degree of reciprocal utility and perhaps even occasional gratification , is approaching a point of irreversible bifurcation , and , to be brief , is in the propinquity of its ultimate regrettable termination			1
’ two things to note here			0
first , the ‘ to be brief ’ is a touch of genius all in itself			0
the other is that , as you ’re watching this , you ’re laughing not just because it ’s brilliantly funny in itself , but because you ’re looking forward to the expression of absolute befuddlement on @entity51 ’s face			0
i must have watched it 30 times			0
if a funnier hour ’s tv has ever been made , i would be amazed			2
@entity3 has written books about @entity18 , @entity212 , @entity15 and @entity213			0
he is also a lecturer on social and political theory at @entity215 , @entity216 , so he knows both halves of this world			0
his book is exemplary , everything we could have wished for			0
as well as talking to everyone and doing the legwork , he offers a critical acuity rare to this sort of book			0
and his conclusions are powerful			0
yes minister and @entity27 , prime minister , he suggests , ‘ did more to engage and educate the general public about politics , in 38 short episodes , than most of the so - called “ serious ” means of enlightenment had done since the age of the great reform acts ’			1
suddenly , voters could see how government and administrators interacted , how policies were developed and how decisions were made			1
but none of this would have happened if the show had n’t also made us laugh suddenly , voters could see how government and administrators interacted , how responsibilities were divided and distributed , how policies were developed , how decisions were made and how successes and failures were defined , described and defended			1
but none of this would have happened if the show had n’t also made us laugh			1
@entity3 does n’t think yes minister changed politicians very much : they ’re still talking in daft soundbites and refusing to answer questions in interviews			1
he suspects civil servants are much the same , too			0
what it did change , though , was us			0
we did n’t know before , but we do now , and as a result , we are much better briefed to fight back			2
it ’s not the smallest of legacies .			0

“ yes , minister ” has become shorthand for absurdity in government
