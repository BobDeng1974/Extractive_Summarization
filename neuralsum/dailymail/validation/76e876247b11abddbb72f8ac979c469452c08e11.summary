obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime , according to research			1
these weight - related cancers include bowel , post-menopausal breast , gallbladder , womb , kidney , pancreatic and oesophageal types			1
statistics released by @entity18 show that obese women have around a one in four risk of developing a cancer linked to weight in their lifetime			1
in a group of 1,000 obese women , 274 will be diagnosed with a bodyweight - linked cancer in their lifetime , compared with 194 women diagnosed in a group of 1,000 healthy weight women			1
approximately a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year			1
there are different ways that obesity could increase the risk of cancer			2
one possibility is that it is linked to the production of hormones by fat cells – especially oestrogen which is thought to fuel the disease			0
around 12 per cent of postmenopausal breast cancers – a total of 5,269 women – are blamed on obesity			1
it is the highest number of cases linked to obesity because the cancer is so common			0
last year a study found women were at double the risk of getting the disease because of their weight compared with men			1
researchers said 8.2 per cent of all cancers in women in the @entity62 were caused by being fat			1
the study found 4.4 per cent of all cancers in men were due to obesity			0
previous estimates claimed if @entity62 continue to pile on the pounds , it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026			1
dr @entity70 of @entity18 said : ' losing weight is n't easy , but you do n't have to join a gym and run miles every day or give up your favourite food			0
just making small changes that you can maintain in the long term can have a real impact			0
to get started , try getting off the bus a stop earlier and cutting down on fatty and sugary foods			0
a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year ' gradually build on these to achieve a healthier lifestyle that you can maintain			1
and find out about local services , which can provide help and support to make lifestyle changes			0
we know that our cancer risk depends on a combination of our genes , our environment and other aspects of our lives , many of which we can control – helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains crucial in tackling the disease			1
' lifestyle changes – like not smoking , keeping a healthy weight , and cutting back on alcohol – are the big opportunities for us all to reduce our cancer risk			2
making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer , but it stacks the odds in our favour			0
' breast cancer patients can raise their chances of survival by exercising , a study has found			2
tumours grew more slowly when mice being treated for cancer had an exercise wheel in their cage			0
it means that in future , breast cancer patients could be prescribed exercise as part of their treatment			2
as cancers grow , the blood vessels supplying them with oxygen become thin and tangled , making it harder for drugs to reach the tumour			0
but when @entity142 researchers from the @entity143 in @entity144 let mice with breast cancer run on wheels , their bloody supply improved			2
researcher dr @entity148 said : ' we were truly amazed by these findings			0
' @entity151 has previously described exercise as a ' wonder drug ' .			0
