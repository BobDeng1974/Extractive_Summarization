by @entity0 @entity1 is on course to overtake @entity3 and become the fifth biggest economy in the world , according to a former @entity7 official			1
@entity8 , who is now senior economic adviser at @entity10 , said the @entity1 could leapfrog @entity3 by the end of the year as the recovery picks up pace			1
the prediction came as a report by rival accountancy firm @entity16 showed business confidence is at its highest level for more than 20 years			1
senior economic adviser at @entity20 says the @entity1 economy could leapfrog @entity3 by the end of the year the survey found 83 per cent of senior executives in the @entity1 were optimistic about the future - up from 71 per cent at the end of last year , and the highest score since records began in 1992			1
in a further boost to chancellor @entity29 , who has staked his political reputation on the recovery , official figures are today ( @entity32 ) expected to show the economy grew strongly in the first three months of 2014			0
the @entity7 believes gross domestic product ( gdp ) - the total size of the economy - grew by 1 per cent in the first quarter , and expects the second quarter ' to be only a little weaker '			0
the last time the economy grew by around 1 per cent for two quarters in a row was in mid- 2007 before the meltdown at @entity44			0
meanwhile , the pound surged to as much as $ 1.6856 yesterday - its strongest reading against the @entity48 dollar since 2009 - as the brightening outlook pushed the currency higher			0
@entity51 , managing director of currency trading firm @entity53 , said : ' there is a simple explanation for the pound 's appreciation and that is the @entity1 economy is exceeding nearly every economist 's expectation			2
' the @entity7 believes gross domestic product ( gdp ) - the total size of the economy - grew by 1 per cent in the first quarter mr @entity8 said that the @entity1 economy is currently the sixth largest in the world but will overtake @entity3 ' in the next couple of years ' based on forecasts by the @entity65			1
but he added that it could happen even sooner given the pace of the recovery in the @entity1 and the weakness of the @entity3 economy			1

' all these economies have bigger populations than us - so fifth place in the world will be as good as it gets for @entity1 in the modern global economy			2
' with the @entity3 economy struggling , and the pound appreciating against the euro , the @entity1 should resume its fifth position soon , quite possibly by the end of this year			1
that should be a cause for national celebration			0

' mirroring the uptick in optimism across other parts of the world - particularly the @entity48 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 - suggests the major global economies are back on track and headed in the right direction which bodes well for @entity1 exporters			2
