one of @entity59 's flowers pictured in a natural habitat , where is looks delicate framed against the larger tree a flower is made from around 100 mice bones and sometimes it takes more than a month to dissect one rodent @entity6 said that he never whittles or alters the bone but only uses its natural shape to create his sculptures ' so i have feelings of resistance toward touching dead bodies at first			1

@entity59 uses a skeleton to create this spidery image of a flower against a black background he uses only real fur , skin , bones and glue so that the materials return to nature after they have been used up the delicacy of @entity6 's work is emphasised by contrasting the white flower with a grey urban backdrop ' i often bring up the image of a flower from the bone 's shape , i never whittle and manufacture bones , i just use the natural characteristics of the bone			2
' i only use real bones , fur skin , and glue			0
because for all stuff will be able to return to the earth			0
