more mothers have weighed in on the debate over whether being bored playing with your children makes you a bad parent			1
@entity6 and @entity7 appeared on today 's @entity8 to reveal their conflicting views			1
mother - of - two @entity6 , a freelance journalist based in @entity11 and @entity12 , said it 's natural for adults to find the repetitive nature of children 's games a complete bore			1
small children love repetitive games			1
it might be delightful to play @entity28 at first but not 300 times later			2
' @entity6 , whose children are now 10 and 12 , said she 's glad the issue is finally being debated as it 's something she never felt she could not admit when hers were small			1
' i felt guilty when my children were babies as i assumed everyone else was having a wonderful time , ' she said			0
she added : ' one of my son , @entity35 's , favourite games when he was little was to stand up in a tube which he wanted me to hold up - i defy anyone to find that interesting			2
' but mother - of - two @entity7 said she would			2
arguing the other side of the case on the @entity45 daytime show , she said : ' i find the different ways my children interpret things so interesting			2
the way they can see something different in a pen or a piece of paper or a cardboard box			0
duty to play along : repetitive games is when children learn and develop ' i 'm fascinated by what my child does on an @entity60 , they play games on there i do n't know how to work			1
' @entity7 , 44 , from @entity12 , who has a six - year - old daughter @entity64 and son @entity65 , 19 months , said parents should put aside how they feel about ' boring ' games because taking part is helping their child learn and develop			1
she said : ' it 's boring from the perspective of an adult but our children rely on us to nurture them and move them forward			2
' she added that if mothers are bored playing with their children at home , there are plenty of playgroups and activities on offer in communities to give them a change of scene			2
@entity6 , left , said it 's natural for adults to find what children enjoy dull but @entity7 disagreed saying she find 's her children 's view of the world fascinating the mothers debate with presenters @entity97 and @entity99 who have a son of their own presenter @entity97 admitted she did find it difficult to say no to playing with her son , @entity102 , 12 , who she has with husband and co-presenter @entity99			1
' as he 's an only child , i feel i should play with him when he wants me to , i 'd find it hard to say i 'm bored , ' she admitted			1
but @entity6 argued that parents should not feel bad about this , as it 's only natural			1
' you are a grown up , you do n't need to fold a piece of paper a 100 times , children can do it themselves , ' she said			0
the show asked viewers to vote on whether there have there been times they 've been bored by their children			0
they said ... definitely : 37 per cent sometimes : 32 per cent never : 31 per cent @entity6 's views echo those of @entity126 columnist and mother - of - four @entity128 , who made her position clear earlier this week			1
she said : ' once you â€™ve kissed all their delicious fatty bits , sniffed the top of their heads and taken comedy pictures of them in adult sunglasses , babies and young toddlers are boring if you spend all day every day with them			0
' the editor of @entity143 said she made an effort with her older two children but soon learnt that it ' drained the joy out of being with them and made me short - tempered and impatient			0
' those were foolish times			0
when the next two arrived , i drew up a shortlist of stuff i was - and was n't - going to do			0
i stopped being an " over-involved mummy pleaser " and started being me			0
i like a bit of glitter - sticking , an hour or so of @entity156 and the occasional bake - off			0
' i do not like @entity158 , putting on a play , pretending to be a fairytale creature , or watching musicals			0
i loathe hide - and - seek and bike - riding			0
