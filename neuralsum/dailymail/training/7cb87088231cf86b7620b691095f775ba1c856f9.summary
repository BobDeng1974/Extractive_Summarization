@entity1 officials are fighting back against giant hornets which have killed 42 people and left 1,600 injured			1
in @entity1 's northern @entity6 province , whole cities have been terrorised by the world 's largest hornet which has started attacking people			1
now government officials have started fighting fire with fire - literally - by burning and gassing the thumb - sized bugs out of their hives			2
horrific pictures have emerged of wounds the size of bullet holes left in the arms of victims after being stung			1
over the past three months the cities of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 have been worst affected			1
experts have suggested the high number of attacks this year could be down to a growth in habitat or unusually warm weather making the hornets more agitated one specialist wearing a protective suit is attacked by a swarm while trying to eradicate the hornets which victims say can chase people for up to 600ft after attacking firefighters and residents had been left to battle the bugs alone but now the government has sent in special eradication teams one victim told local media that ' the more you run , the more they want to chase you ' and some victims described being chased about 200 metres ( 656 feet ) by the deadly insects			2
authorities have mobilised a special medic team and trained more medical personnel to treat victims			2
the insects ' highly toxic stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and renal failure			2
one of the victims , named only as @entity75 , said she has spent two months in a hospital undergoing 13 dialysis treatments			0
until government specialists arrived today locals have had to tackle the wasps themselves with no protective clothing , brave residents have used whatever means they can to exterminate the pests the aggressive animals will feed on honeybees , severing their heads , wings and legs before carrying the body back to their young she has 200 stitches , but still can not move her legs			0
she told @entity96 , the @entity1 state - run news agency : ' the hornets were horrifying '			1
' they hit right at my head and covered my legs			0
all of a sudden i was stung and i could n't move			0
' even now , my legs are covered with sting holes			0
' attacks on humans are rare and specialists are unable to fully explain why this year has seen so many more cases			0
theories include increased plant growth boosting the number of the insects , and unusually warm weather making the creatures more agitated			0
victims of the hornets have been left with bullet - hole sized wounds in their arms and legs the poison in the stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and kidney failure at high doses september and october is the breeding season for the big bugs , meaning now is when they are most active			1
the insects are an aggressive and predatory animal , however , and will send out scouts to look for honeybee hives for them to colonise			0
when one is found the scout will leave a pheromone trail which other hornets will then follow , before using their jaws to decapitate the bees			0
after slaughtering thousands of the much smaller creatures , the hornets will then take over the nest for themselves			0
the species has already spread to @entity144 and fears are growing that giant @entity147 hornets are headed for @entity148			1
the thumb - sized insects have been attacking people and experts struggle to explain why there are fears the insects could head to @entity148 after spreading to @entity144 in 2004 in a delivery of pottery the hornets use their powerful sting , jaws , and superior size to kill up to 30,000 bees an hour the deadly species are four times the size of @entity148 honeybees and have been known to wipe out entire hives as they look to claim the nest as their own the species is four times the size of our native honeybees which are already struggling due to a mysterious syndrome which wipes out entire nests			1
the dark invaders with yellow feet are thought to have arrive in @entity144 in a delivery of @entity1 pottery from the @entity178 in late 2004			1
the insects have colonised huge swathes of @entity144 , spreading along waterways , and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in a couple of hours , honey production has plummeted			1
it has so far colonised 39 of @entity144 â€™s 100 administrative departments .			2

@entity1 authorities have sent exterminators to @entity6 province
cities have been terrorised for three months by giant insects
there have been 42 deaths and 1,600 have been left with bullet - like wounds
species is already in @entity144 and could spread to @entity148
