by @entity0 an eco-warrior has made his home in an apple tree to prevent developers chopping it down			1
@entity6 has spent most of the past week in the 150 - year - old tree , in the heart of @entity10 country in @entity11			1
his efforts have drawn comparisons with those of @entity15 – real name @entity15 – the campaigner who hit the headlines in 1996 when he dug tunnels under the proposed routes of major road projects			2
shall not be moved : @entity6 has been camping out in the boughs of this apple tree for the past week happy camper : mr @entity6 has constructed a bed and brought up other essentials he has garnered overwhelming support from residents , who have been bringing him soup , sandwiches and water			1
but the protest was almost ended yesterday when the 44 - year - old climbed down at 3am to try to sneak a few hours ' sleep in a bed			1
by 5am contractors had moved in and begun lopping the 20ft tree			1
mr @entity6 raced back , evaded police and scaled the tree again , joined by a second protester , @entity39 , 39			1
they want to protect the tree – and a thriving colony of badgers beneath it			1
prime land : the apple tree is part of a site set to be turned into luxury homes support : locals of @entity51 , @entity11 , have shown their support for the protest supplies : enthusiastic local supporters have been supplying mr @entity6 with soup , sandwiches and water teamwork : mr @entity6 was far from alone in his efforts developers want to build 14 luxury homes on the one - acre site at @entity51 , near the childhood home of @entity10 author @entity65			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ this is an old tree and the badger sett is unusually large			1
there ’s a growing movement in @entity70 to save orchard trees and i personally want the badger sett fenced off as mini nature reserve rather than moved			2
' or why ca n’t they incorporate it as part of the houses ’ gardens ? ‘ just because something has been given planning permission does n’t mean it ’s correct			0
if more people did what i ’m doing more often , councils would get a bit tired and change the rules so they can retract their decision			0
’ poised : developers are waiting to chop the tree down and continue building the peculiarly @entity92 stand - off is happening on the edge of @entity51 , @entity11 , on a patch of land which was in years gone by an orchard and a market garden , then became a much - loved green space which planning officers called the ‘ last breathing space for local people ’			1
but planning permission to build the 12 three - bedroom and two four - bedroom houses in terrace blocks was granted to developer @entity105 after he bought the land - despite more than 100 letters of objection about his controversial plans to @entity110			0
the site is just two miles from @entity113 , the village where @entity65 lived and around which he based his famous novel about his bucolic childhood , ‘ @entity10 ’ , and in this little corner of the country feelings run high particularly about protecting the countryside and conserving nature			0
contractors began clearing the site a fortnight ago , but at first the 20ft apple tree remained intact thanks in no small part to mr @entity6 ’s tree - scaling prowess			1
opposition : the local council received more than 100 letters opposing the development a steady stream of locals have been supporting his cause by coming to the site with supplies for him and banners saying ‘ @entity51 apple town ’ and ‘ houses out , badger in ’			1
some children have made t - shirts with the logo ‘ paws off our setts ’			0
@entity146 , 35 , a landscape architect , whose home borders the site , said : ‘ i ’m not against building homes , we need homes , but there should be space for wildlife as well - human habitation and precious wildlife should find a way to live together			0
‘ this was a wildlife haven and the apple tree was part of our heritage			2
it was so peaceful here before			0
since the work began it feels like we ’re under siege			0
’ under the planning permission , mr @entity105 must leave a 2.5m wide dedicated ‘ wildlife corridor ’ along the western and southern boundaries of the site			2
he has also been granted a licence from @entity168 for the badgers to be moved			0
this is likely to be done by installing one - way gates over the 22 entrances to their sett so they can get out , but ca n’t go back in again			0
' battle ground : neither side had showed any sign of relenting it is expected they will then wander off and make a find a new home with another nearby colony			0
mr @entity105 ’s planning agent @entity182 , of @entity183 , said : ‘ he is doing everything in accordance with the policies and has the necessary planning permissions and consents			2
‘ the trees were looked at as part of the planning application and no preservation orders were put in place			0
' an ecologist was appointed to deal with badger relocation and is on site to make sure that everything is done correctly			2
’ after yesterday ’s early morning drama , the contractors stopped working temporarily and a single bulldozer sat idle on the site			0
a @entity203 spokesman confirmed that contractors started taking the apple tree down early yesterday when no one was in it , but two - thirds of the way into their work a protester climbed back up the tree			1
he added : ‘ no one was arrested or threatened with arrest			0
the chief inspector responsible for @entity51 is meeting with the owner of the land and we believe that no action will be taken against any of the protesters because the contractors what things done as low key as possible			1
’ developer @entity223 said : ' i hope we can have a reasonable discussion with the guys up the tree and persuade them what we 're doing is the best that could be hoped for from any developer on this site			2

@entity6 , 44 , has been camping out in the tree all week
he wants to stop builders chopping it down and displacing a badger family
locals in @entity51 , @entity11 have supported his protest
but the tree was nearly *felled* when mr @entity6 climbed down to sleep in a proper bed
