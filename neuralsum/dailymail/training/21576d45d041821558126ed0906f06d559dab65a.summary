gun enthusiasts are up in arms over a video game			2
not over a violent game such as @entity4 , where players regularly kill prostitutes , shoot innocent bystanders and thieve cars			0
no , the @entity9 is fired up over a game based on the beloved animated family @entity12			1
the @entity12 : tapped out is a video game for @entity15 and @entity16 that has proved wildly popular			1
in a press release from @entity21 , makers of the game , it 's described as ' life - ruiningly fun '			1
gamers can create their own virtual @entity24 , collect characters and go on missions such as ' partying down with the @entity27 at the @entity28 ' and ' growing @entity29 on @entity30 '			0
taking aim : gun enthusiasts are angry at the blatant lampooning of the @entity9 and gun enthusiasts in the last level of @entity12 : tapped out so far , so unpolitical			1
the problem for gun - toting game critics comes when they reach level 30 and get a free content update for the game			1
according to @entity43 , level 30 is at present the highest level players can reach			1
at level 30 , a storyline involving @entity47 store evolves that contains some fairly clear commentary on gun laws in the @entity51 and takes some cheap shots at the organization			1
@entity43 pulled some quotes from the level that has the @entity9 gunning for the game			1
' you ’re the perfect gun owner ! step inside ! ' says @entity58 to @entity59 who has just told him how poor his vision and aim are , and how he often mistakes loved ones for intruders			0
' hey , @entity66 , want to go check out the new gun shop in town ? ' @entity65 asks @entity66 ' of course ! after all , the @entity9 says it ’s the safest place for kids , ' @entity66 replies			1
' they also say us kids should sleep under a blanket made of loaded guns			1
you know - for safety , ' @entity65 says			0
virtual @entity24 : @entity59 enters @entity80 's shop to buy a gun too close for comfort : @entity59 is sold a gun in the game satire : the game 's jokes have been deemed boorish by some gamers ' i eat my cereal every morning with a gun instead of a spoon			2
because more guns everywhere means safer kids			0
thanks , @entity9 ! ' says @entity66			0
police chief wiggum : ' i ’d like to purchase this @entity97 , please			0
will you need to run a background check on me ? ' @entity58 : ' of course not			0
that would infringe on your constitutional right to never be inconvenienced - even in the tiniest , most reasonable way - when guns are involved			0
' @entity105 to @entity106 : ' you do realize it ’s now illegal to operate a store that does n’t sell firearms ? it ’s all part of the “ how else may we serve , @entity112 and @entity9 ? ” act			0
you ’re going to jail ! ' gun control : police chief @entity115 buys a gun without a background check in the game the @entity12 has long used satire as a means to ridicule elements of society , and it 's certainly not the first time the show 's creators have had their characters comment on guns			1
the episode @entity128 , during which @entity130 eventually realizes his folly in buying a gun to protect his family , contains lines such as ' i do n't have to be careful			0
i have a gun ' , and this exchange : @entity130 : ' i 'd like your deadliest gun please			0
' clerk : ' @entity141 to the sympathy cards ' the show has been more evenhanded than the game appears to be , though : in that episode , @entity130 was ejected from the @entity9 for not following gun safety rules			1
the show : in the episode @entity128 , @entity130 acquires a gun the satire on the show is often slightly more subtle than that in level 30 of @entity153 , which is loud and clear about current gun laws			1
the accusation of ' hidden messages ' implies there 's something secretive or underhand , or even subliminal in the game 's handling of gun issues , which could n't be more off - target			2
comments about the game on a post on @entity165 called ' the @entity12 : @entity166 is @entity167			2
very @entity167 ' express unhappiness with the game 's treatment of the @entity9			2
@entity171 wrote , ' is anyone shocked that these people , who at every turn , bash all things that are upright & decent [ ? ] they are condecending ( sic ) of churches , as an example , blapheming ( sic ) even the almighty @entity183			0
i stopped watching this show a long time ago			0
i ’m sorry i ever did to begin with			0
' @entity186 wrote , ' the only gun owners i ’m afraid of are so - called “ adults ” who watch cartoons			2
they ’re supposed to be stupid			0
' level 30 : @entity58 's @entity195 is the setting for the game 's contentious gun statements issues : the @entity12 cartoon has always addressed issues in a light - hearted satirical way , without pushing any agenda - unlike level 30 of tapped out it 's not known how much involvement the creators of @entity12 had with the game , if any			1
a forum on the @entity21 site set up for the game has players pondering the out - of - character indelicacy of the level			1
' [ is anyone surprised ] at how political this new questline is ? the @entity12 , when political , has always seemed gently so , but this is pretty rough stuff			2
not surprised the writers feel this way , just surprised to see it so nakedly displayed in the game , ' wrote shaygitz			0
@entity221 wrote : ' this quest is pretty much how people in the @entity224 view the lunacy of the @entity51 's right to bear arms			0
' according to @entity230 , the game 's makers never expected gamers would play long enough to get to level 30			1
' sorry about level 30 , guys			2
if you promise not to gripe to @entity21 too much , everybody can have three donuts , ' @entity115 tells players at the end of level 30 .			1

the game *includes* such quotes as ' [ the @entity9 ] also say us kids should sleep under a blanket made of loaded guns . you know - for safety '
makers of the game , @entity21 , say they never expected gamers to reach level 30
