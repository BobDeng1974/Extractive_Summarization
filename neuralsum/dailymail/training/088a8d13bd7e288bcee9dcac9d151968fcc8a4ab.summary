a possible split between old and new @entity2 executive committee members has emerged ahead of the vote on friday on whether the @entity5 report into @entity7 bidding should be published			1
it follows a suggestion by @entity2 president @entity10 at the previous @entity12 meeting that only those members who were on the committee for the 2010 vote should have a say on the report 's publication			1
that would rule out more than half the current members and if @entity10 tries to resurrect the move at the meeting in @entity23 on friday he is likely to face sustained opposition			0
@entity2 's executive committee members are due to vote on the publication of @entity5 's corruption report one @entity2 member said : ' if it is raised again i would strongly oppose it			1
' @entity33 lawyer @entity5 's resignation as @entity2 's ethics investigator has put further pressure on the world governing body , and the executive committee will vote on whether his report should be published but with names redacted			1
at the previous @entity12 meeting in september , several members confirmed that @entity10 suggested those members elected since the december 2010 vote should not have a say on the @entity5 report 's publication			1
only 13 of the 22 members who awarded the 2018 and 2022 @entity49 to @entity50 and @entity51 respectively remain on the @entity52 - there are now 25 members plus a further two co-opted members			2
@entity10 said only older ( pre 2010 ) members should be allowed to vote on the publication of the report not all the older members would support such a move by @entity10 however - it is understood @entity62 president @entity61 , who has previously backed publishing the report , would be in favour of a free vote involving all members			1
another intriguing aspect of the meeting is that the three @entity2 members understood to have been under investigation by @entity5 for potential ethics code breaches are expected to be permitted to take part in the vote			2
@entity76 's @entity75 , @entity78 's @entity77 and @entity80 's @entity79 were all under investigation by @entity5 for either alleged code breaches during the 2018/2022 bidding process or for failing to comply with his investigations			0
he had also opened proceedings against former @entity12 member @entity87 , the former @entity89 player and manager , and @entity91 , the head of @entity2 's inspection team which compiled a technical report on the bidding countries			1
@entity5 's report was only published as a summary by @entity2 , something @entity5 himself quickly denounced @entity5 resigned as chairman of the investigatory chamber of @entity2 's independent ethics committee on wednesday after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear @entity50 and @entity51 to host the @entity49			1
@entity5 issued a hard - hitting statement criticising @entity2 's ' lack of leadership ' and saying he can not change the culture of the world governing body			2
@entity111 's @entity2 vice-president @entity110 said @entity5 's resignation was ' damaging '			2
@entity110 told @entity113 : ' i am totally shocked			0
@entity5 is someone of the very highest credibility			0
he must feel very , very strongly about certain things when it has got to this stage			0
' i have always said that as much of that ( @entity5 ) report , as legally possible , should now be put in the public domain			0
i honestly feel that this has got to a stage now where people are absolutely fed up with it			0
we need to bring it to a conclusion			0
' until this situation is completely resolved , and brought to a head , i 'm sorry , but @entity2 's reputation is always going to be damaged			2
