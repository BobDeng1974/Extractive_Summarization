by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 20 june 2013 @entity1 of @entity3 's penchant for smart , feminine maternity wear has sparked a nationwide trend among @entity7 's other mothers - to - be , according to a new report today			1
department store chain @entity9 has seen sales of sophisticated dresses and smart styles in their maternity collections increase by more than 500 per cent compared to this time last year , and is attributing this to pregnant women wanting to emulate the @entity1 ' well - documented elegant look			1
with not a pair of dungarees , leggings or a smock in sight , the @entity19 has continued to paint a picture of elegance throughout her pregnancy			2
for her , maternity style has meant neatly tailored coats that skim her burgeoning bump , smart dresses with empire line or wrap styling and just a hint of a higher hemline to emphasise her still - slender legs			1
there was no hint of dowdy maternity wear as the @entity1 watched the @entity40 last week in her last royal engagement before the birth , wearing a pale pink coat with pearl buttons and matching hat @entity19 managed to combine high - fashion with comfort in the later stages of her pregnancy in a dalmatian print coat and black fascinator hat when she named the royal princess at @entity53 last week @entity19 has favoured chic tailored coats throughout her pregnancy to add class and comfort to her outfits and @entity9 has reported that its customer is following suit			1
no more do pregnant young women want to shroud themselves in yards of fabric , nor do they want to forgo fashion for nine months			0
as a result , the store has seen an increase in sales of the very sort of clothes the duchess has been favouring			2
clothing items proving popular include printed blouses in cool cottons and satins ( sales up 36 per cent ) , smart coats and kimono - sleeve dresses ( sales up 127 per cent )			1
@entity9 spokeswoman @entity79 said : ' details such as embellishment and soft fabrics are important to our customers , as they want to get the @entity19 look even whilst pregnant			0
' women seem to be shunning more stereotypical , casual types of maternity wear such as jersey trousers and leggings , and instead want to look and feel their best			0
' dresses with a kimono style ( right ) and angel sleeves ( left ) have seen a huge increase in sales as pregnant women aim to emulate the @entity1 's elegant maternity style @entity19 's fun and fresh take on her style through her pregnancy has clearly inspired other expectant mothers to forgo the usual baggy elasticated look and embrace a more fashion conscious range of maternity wear women are also emulating @entity19 's off - duty look , with pretty woven tops and cropped capri trousers selling well , with some lines up more than 500 per cent			1
due to the popularity of elegant maternity wear styles and shapes , @entity9 is dubbing the trend ' @entity1 effect '			0
ms @entity79 added : ' we have done a lot of work on our maternity ranges to ensure we are offering customers what they want			0
clothes still need to be comfortable , but not necessarily baggy and made from 100 per cent elastic			0
' sales suggest that mums - to - be are waving goodbye to leggings and dungarees , and opting for timeless , stylish maternity wear			2
' @entity9 is planning to roll out more formal and occasion maternity styles to keep up with the trend , and cope with customer demand as the season moves into autumn .			0
