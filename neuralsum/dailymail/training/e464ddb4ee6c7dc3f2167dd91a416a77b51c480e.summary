the thick pea - soupers that hung over @entity2 cities until the 1950s live on in the memory of those who experienced the life threatening smogs			1
but a new collection of photographs featuring @entity10 in the 1940s and 1950s show people living in the @entity14 industrial city suffered just as badly			1
pollution was once so bad in @entity10 that it could block out the midday sun. the scale of the problem is revealed in pictures from the @entity20 at the archives of the @entity22			2
danger : crowds of people in @entity10 go about their business with a thick smog visibly filling the air and clouding the tops of surrounding buildings daylight : the smog in 1950s @entity10 was so thick at times that it could block out the midday sun , but for decades people were unaware of the dangers the thick clouds of coal smoke and industrial pollution posed to people 's health in the @entity14 city danger : clouds of choking pollution once shrouded the skyscrapers of @entity10 before authorities took action by banning the burning of coal in the @entity14 city the problem in @entity10 had been a long standing one with victorian - era @entity2 novelist and @entity56 @entity55 writing that @entity10 was ' without exception is the blackest place which i ever saw '			1
despite his grimy review , the lack of alternative fuels in the 19th century made introducing smoke controls difficult			0
also lots of people thought that high smoke output was a sign of high productivity and that coal smoke was good for the lungs and helped crops grow			0
the photographic collection was put together to highlight the history of the city 's smoke control laws which were first passed in 1941 , but then delayed by the @entity76 leaving residents choking in the fumes for more than a decade longer			2
looming : as cars and pedestrians go about their daily business the thick clouds of smog cut down visibility , leaving the view between the city 's tall buildings hidden even during the day horror : the collection of @entity10 smog pictures has been put together by the @entity14 city 's university to show how bad the problem was and how laws were eventually introduced to restrict the burning of coal to tackle the dangerous problem past : the smog which engulfed @entity10 for decades was initially thought to be good for crops and a proud symbol of the city 's industrial progress and energy an essay called @entity105 by @entity106 which first appeared in the @entity108 's january 1868 edition detailed how the problem had been plaguing the city since the 19th century			1
he described conditions in the city , where 230,000 people lived at the time , by writing ' walking up a long hill to @entity116 in @entity105 , and looking over into hell with the lid taken off			0
' he said : ' the town lies low , as at the bottom of an excavation , just visible through the mingled smoke and mist , and every object in it is black			0
smoke , smoke , smoke - everywhere smoke			0
' industry : this picture shows a factory chimney spewing out smoke in the city , adding to @entity10 's intense air pollution problem which was once so bad the midday sun could be blocked out visibility : the @entity10 smog hides a huge building even at close range , with the upper floors invisible and the buildings outline blurred by the combination of industrial pollution and coal fire smoke while air quality in @entity10 have improved greatly since the 1950s , the thick pea soupers which can kill young and elderly people , remain a problem in newly industrialised countries			1
in @entity150 last week foreign embassies were warned by a senior official that issuing air pollution readings were illegal and interfering in its internal business			0
official forecasts in the @entity150 capital @entity158 , which is home to 20 million people , often predict light pollution - even when the city is shrouded in haze			2
life : car exhaust fumes added to the @entity10 smog which was a problem in the industrialised @entity14 city for decades until new laws on burning coal were introduced in the 1950s shroud : @entity171 brought wealth to @entity10 , but the resulting smog became to high a price to pay with officials eventually realising action was needed to tackle the longstanding problem			1

the pea - souper problem was once so bad that clouds of smoke and pollution would block out the midday sun
photographs from the 1950s show just how badly the @entity14 city suffered before laws on coal burning were introduced
