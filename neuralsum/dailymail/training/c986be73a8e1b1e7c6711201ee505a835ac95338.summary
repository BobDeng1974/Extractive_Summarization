by @entity0 industrial action may be taken by staff at the @entity3 if a proposed extension to their working day goes ahead			1
formal action is yet to be taken , but on monday afternoon the @entity3 is expected to put forward a proposal that could require workers to be at their desks for an additional nine minutes each day , for no additional pay			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity3 told the @entity12 that ' the day ends at 4.51 according to enterprise agreement			0
' staff at the @entity15 could have their work days extended from 4.51pm to 5pm the spokeswoman said this is due to the fact that core working hours are stated as 7.21 per day in the agreement			2
however , @entity23 , secretary of the @entity25 branch that represents workers at the @entity3 told the @entity12 they are ' strongly opposed ' to any push from the government that could see staff finishing closer to 5pm			1
he said the extra minutes staff could be asked to work per day ' is equivalent to cutting five and third days in annual leave per year '			1
the @entity3 spokeswoman said they are keeping staff informed and currently working through a range of options			0
' the @entity3 will negotiate in good faith with the @entity37 , the @entity25 and individual employee representatives on its enterprise agreement			2
according to the @entity3 enterprise agreement , the working day currently ends at 4.51pm ' we will be discussing a range of employment conditions as part of that process , but as part of our commitment to good faith bargaining we will not be publicly commenting on the negotiations prior to bargaining discussions			1
' there are many hoops the unions need to jump through before industrial action can be taken , but mr @entity23 said it was unlikely the @entity3 would change their minds unless they put up a big fight			1
' industrial action ca n't be taken in the immediate future as the fair work act lays down a process to be followed			2
' ( but ) they have little incentive to change their position if they [ the unions ] do n't take action			0
' ' the last time they tried this was in 2006 and we campaigned strongly against it then , and the tax office withdrew their position			0
' on monday afternoon the @entity3 are expected to formally hand down proposed changes mr @entity23 also said there would be no compromise from the union on working hours , and the government was trying to implement the changes for their own benefit			1
' the government is n't prepared to share the productivity savings which are expected from the tax office over the next few years			0
' ' the purpose behind that from their perspective is to finance a minimal pay rise			0
' the exact proposed changes will be formally revealed early next week , and if the tax office are n't prepared to cooperate industrial action could take place in the coming months .			0

the @entity3 are expected to extend the working day beyond its current end at 4.51pm
@entity25 will fight the changes with industrial action if necessary
@entity25 branch secretary @entity23 said the changes are equivalent to cutting over five days in annual leave
