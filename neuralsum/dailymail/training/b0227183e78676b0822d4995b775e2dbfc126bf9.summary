by @entity0 last updated at 3:49 pm on 4th january 2012 dozens of clinics have come forward to admit that breast implants they gave to women have ruptured – but health secretary @entity5 has revealed much of the data filed is incomplete			1
he has given clinics until friday to submit full data on the implants and the results will be published next week			1
but he told @entity10 today : ' some of the private providers , as of yesterday , had not provided any data at all , many had , some had provided what on the face of it looks quite good data , others what appeared to be very poor quality			2
' there is growing concern about the safety of the cheaply made implants , which used low - grade industrial silicone designed for mattresses at least 50 clinics have reported burst , perished and broken implants made by @entity32 firm @entity31 to the medical watchdog since friday			1
the total number of women whose implants have ruptured is not known , but even conservative estimates suggest it could be as high as 1,000			2
the government still insists there is no need to remove them en masse			0
yesterday , consultant plastic surgeon @entity44 , who is sitting on the panel investigating the implant scandal , said there were no firm figures in the @entity49 on what proportion of devices have ruptured			0
the president of the @entity53 , who is advising mr @entity5 , added : ‘ the point is not so much the rupture rates but that the quality of the silicone in these implants is not of medical grade			1
@entity5 , left has ordered clinics to produce data on the implants and shadow health secretary @entity64 , right , has criticised the cosmetic surgery industry for poor after - care ' when things go wrong ' surgeons can take out most breast implants in around an hour , going in through the original 5cm scar under the breast			1
all implants create scar tissue around them once inside - known as the scar capsule - and this can be removed at the same time as the implant			2
however , if an implant ruptures , scar tissue can build up to a greater degree , causing hardness , and can be more difficult to remove			0
while most women have no symptoms when a silicone breast implant ruptures , the leaking gel can cause pain and result in changes to the contour or shape of the breast			0
the gel may cause inflammation and the layers of extra scar @entity92 of a breast implant can be confirmed by mammogram , ultrasound , ct scan or @entity98			0
@entity99 , consultant plastic surgeon said if an implant ruptures the ' goo ' must also be taken out			0
operations of this type also carry the risks of anaesthetic and a small risk of infection			0
' recovery is also about two weeks - that is you should allow two weeks to get back to day to day activities , ' he added			0
' therefore , the implants are not fit to be implanted into humans			2
they are substandard , they are defective			0
' the government must make sure that women who have these implants are not caught in the middle of an argument over who 's going to pay for their removal			2
' i think we have reached a point and the level of anxiety is such that there should be clear advice over what is the right course of action for women to take			0
' @entity134 , a former president of @entity53 , said : ‘ it would be sensible for the government to say , “ take them out ” and then sort out the funding later			2
’ @entity139 said that the public had been ‘ left in the dark ’ and called for the £ 2.3billion private cosmetic surgery industry , which carried out 95 per cent of the operations , to take responsibility			1
shadow health secretary @entity64 said : ‘ i get a sense that these individuals are very good at the sales pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at after - care and facing up to responsibilities when things go wrong			1
’ but the trade body for private medical clinics , @entity154 , said it would be ‘ irresponsible ’ to remove all implants as any surgery carries risks , and , in any case , clinics could n’t afford to foot the bill			1
it said that an audit of thousands of cases by its members suggests the true rupture rate lies between 1 per cent and 2 per cent and so is ‘ within the industry standard ’			1
as many as 50,000 women in the @entity49 , including thousands of breast cancer survivors , have the fragile implants , so even a 2 per cent failure rate would take the number of ruptures to 1,000			0
@entity32 health minister @entity174 , pictured , has ordered a full investigation into the ' truly contaminated ' implants at the weekend , figures from private chain transform suggested the true rupture rate to be 7 per cent			1
but a spokesman said the figure was based on seven cases out of just 108 patients – too small a sample for robust statistics			0
in @entity32 , between 5 per cent and 10 per cent have ruptured and the state is to fund removal from 30,000 women			1
last night , @entity32 health minister @entity174 ordered a full investigation into the ‘ truly contaminated ’ implants .			1
