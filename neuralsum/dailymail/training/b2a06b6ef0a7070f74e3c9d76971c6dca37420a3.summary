by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:40 est , 1 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:40 est , 1 february 2014 as statements go , last week ’s assertion by the mayor of @entity7 that there are no gays in the resort hosting the @entity11 deserves a gold medal in gibberish			1
ridicule was immediately heaped on @entity15 , a burly @entity16 supporter , after his views were broadcast on the @entity20 ’s @entity19 programme , prompting yet more concern over @entity23 ’s fitness to host the @entity11 – the ‘ @entity24 ’ – which open in five days ’ time			1
now , one local gay man has written a scathing open letter to the 53 - year - old mayor , making it clear that he is definitely not the only gay in the @entity30			1
' there are many gays in @entity7 ' : @entity33 , co-owner of the @entity35 gay club in @entity7 , with two drag queen cabaret stars			1
he says that mayor @entity15 is aware of his club , despite denying knowing any gays ‘ the absurdity of your statement is similar to the old canard that there was no sex in the @entity47 , ’ said 24 - year - old tour guide @entity39			1
‘ you are mistaken or simply pretending when you say you do not know one single gay person			2
' believe me , there are enough of them in your own administration , and you probably often share meeting rooms or offices with them			0
’ how could the mayor , born and bred in @entity7 , not notice ? take @entity57 , one of several night clubs aimed at gays in the city			1
offering a male striptease show among other entertainments , it is situated in the shadow of the mayor ’s office , making his apparent ignorance even less explicable			1
‘ i ’ve been here a few times , ’ said @entity1 , 31 , a lesbian , who has lived with her partner in @entity7 for two years			2
this city is cool , definitely more relaxed than many places in @entity23			1
’ then there is the @entity74 , which promises ‘ fun , hedonism , old friends and new faces ’			0
it is nine miles from @entity16 ’s palatial @entity7 residence , from where he has overseen the £ 31 billion @entity83 constructions , the costliest ever			2
‘ this gay hotel is run on a high @entity89 level			2
i ’ve travelled all around @entity89 , and while i do n’t like the tone of the @entity23 debate on homosexuality and the persecution people can face , this place is somewhere you can relax , ’ said @entity84 , 27 , an entrepreneur from @entity85 who stayed here last summer			2
@entity96 : a poster for the @entity35 gay club pokes fun at the forthcoming winter games another more famous gay club – @entity35 – offers nightly drag shows for up to 400 customers in a dimly lit , one - storey building close to the seafront			2
there is no sign outside because it has been ripped down so often by homophobic youths			0
the dancers include a @entity111 former butcher , an @entity112 who also owns a strip club , and a @entity115 who loves to sing like @entity116 and dress like @entity118			0
misrepresented ? a spokesman for @entity15 's office said the mayor 's comments were taken out of context by the media in a gold sequin dress , drag queen @entity125 , 44 , is well known in @entity7			1
he powders his cleavage before risking a joke about @entity16 : ‘ our president has sensual lips and such a toned body			0
’ the mayor ’s strange lack of knowledge is tackled by @entity33 , co-owner of the @entity35			0
‘ there are many gays in @entity7 , more than in most @entity23 cities , ’ he said			1
‘ our mayor knows this			0
he is fully aware of our club , and was in touch with us long before this tv programme			0
’ mr @entity33 , openly in a relationship with another man , said he had attended meetings with the mayor over improving the gloomy lighting outside his club			0
‘ he invited us to his office			0
the major knows we are a gay club and there was no problem about it			0
we have discussed matters of safety and tolerance with him			0
about a month before this @entity20 story , there was a meeting in @entity7 when the mayor invited representatives of all ethnic communities for a discussion on tolerance towards gay people who attend the @entity11			1
’ so how did the mayor come to make his claim ? mr @entity33 ’s explanation is that the @entity20 mangled the meaning of the politician ’s words			0
he has been told mr @entity15 was under the impression he had been asked whether there were gay activists or gay organisations in @entity7			1
a source in the mayor ’s office said : ‘ the phrase was taken out of context , because the next thing he said was that naturally there are gay people in @entity7			1
' he was saying that we do n’t parade it – for example , we do n’t have gay parades			0

@entity7 is host to several well - known gay clubs and a gay - friendly hotel
locals say there are many gays in the city , more than elsewhere in @entity23
source in the mayor 's office says his comments were taken out of context
