research undertaken at the @entity1 shows that dope cheats such as @entity3 could still be benefiting from taking banned substances years after initial usage			1
the experiments carried out by by scientists in @entity8 show for the first time that muscles could retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids for decades after they were first used			2
the 2004 @entity14 100 metres champion @entity3 was banned for a maximum of eight years by the @entity16 after testing positive for testosterone at the @entity18 in @entity19 in 2006 - his second failed drugs test			1
@entity3 ( left ) powers ahead during the @entity23 meeting at @entity24 in july @entity3 ( right ) attempts to chase down @entity25 as the @entity26 claimed bronze at @entity28 professor of physiology at the @entity1 @entity31 and his team studied the effect of steroids on mice and believes that the same mechanism is at work in human muscles and that other performance - enhancing drugs would have similar long - term effects			1
@entity31 told @entity41 : ' i would be very surprised if there were any major differences between humans and mice in this context			0
' the fundamental biology of muscle growth is similar in humans and in mice , and in principle any drug that builds muscle mass could trigger this mechanism			0
' i think it is likely that effects could be lifelong or at least lasting decades in humans			2
our data indicates the exclusion time of two years is far too short			2
even four years is too short			2
' thirty - two - year - old @entity59 served a four - year ban after appeal to arbitration and - after his return to the sport in 2010 - he ran the fastest 100 metres in the world in this year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the @entity67 in @entity68 last month			1
but @entity71 400 metres hurdles champion @entity69 said : ' he 's over the hill as far as sprinting is concerned - he should never be running these times for the 100m and 200m			1
gatlin in 2006 , the year he was was banned for a maximum of eight years by the @entity16 @entity69 ( centre ) says @entity3 's phenomenal times this year suggest the steroids he took still have an effect ' but he 's still doing it , and you have to look at his past , and ask how it is still affecting him now , because the average person would n't be able to do that			1
' those are incredible performances			0
not many people have run that fast separately , ever			0
to do it on a damp friday night ? i could n't believe those times			0
' it shows one of two things : either he 's still taking performance - enhancing drugs to get the best out of him at his advanced age , or the ones he did take are still doing a fantastic job			1
' because there is no way he can still be running that well at this late point in his career			0
@entity3 celebrates winning the men 's 100m sprint in @entity110 , @entity111 in september to continue his superb year ' after having years on the sidelines , being unable to train or compete , it does n't really add up			1
9.77 is an incredibly fast time			0
you only have to look at his performances			0
i do n't believe in them			0
' the new data casts a further shadow over formerly - banned athletes such as @entity3 , his compatriot @entity123 and @entity71 's @entity124			1
in his defence , @entity3 's agent @entity125 said : ' @entity3 would have run these times , and faster , had his over-zealous ( former ) coach @entity128 not tried to get him there sooner than he would 've naturally gotten there			1
' so , what @entity3 is doing right now , i 'm not surprised by that			2
' his body is rested for four years , so he was n't racing			2
and he was the talent that i always knew he was			0
' hear more on 5live @entity135 , tuesday 7 october , 20.30 - 22.00			0

@entity1 research shows effects of steroids can be long - lasting
the study shows that muscles can retain advantages from banned substances years after they were used
@entity3 was banned for taking drugs in 2006 but is in *excellent* form and has ran the fastest 100 metres in the world this year
@entity71 400 metres hurdles champion @entity69 says @entity3 's *current* speed *supports* the @entity1 's *hypothesis*
