but miss @entity1 said she has been left without a further reply and still has her life on hold			2
the only option left to her now is to convince the @entity46 in @entity47 that she is genetically linked to her mother , and therefore automatically a @entity9 citizen			1
the aspiring nurse , who is in talks with lawyers , said : ‘ i ’m frustrated and angry			0
i happen to have been born in @entity10 but i have lived in @entity4 almost my entire life , but proving it seems to be a problem			1

‘ i want to work and go to university and support myself but i ca n’t			0
i will do whatever it takes and if i have to go to court to prove i exist then that ’s what i ’ll do			2

but when she applied to the @entity85 to study nursing she was refused as she did not have the documentation			0
her desperate struggle has led her to @entity91 msp @entity89 , former @entity3 mp @entity92 , the @entity19 and the @entity93 in @entity94			2
but embassy staff could find no record of her birth and sent her back to the @entity98			2

pictured as a two - year - old , left , in 1989 with her older brother @entity72 while living in @entity10 where she was born ‘ it ’s ridiculous			1
i just want the consulate to recognise my birth so i can do all the things that everyone else takes for granted			0
‘ it ’s not fair on my parents			0
i want to move in with my boyfriend but we ca n’t afford to because he does n’t earn enough to support me			0
‘ i hate asking for money to do the simplest thing but it is all i can do			0
i want to earn my own			0
’ @entity34 said : ‘ the government should be giving her benefits to live until it is sorted			0
‘ people who move here from other countries are entitled , but my daughter , who is @entity4 , is n’t			2
‘ it seems she has fewer rights than everyone else and it ’s not fair			0
’ @entity134 , an immigration lawyer at @entity4 law firm @entity135 , said the only option left is to apply for a declaration of parentage at the @entity46			2
‘ @entity1 ’s mum would have to prove to the court that @entity1 is her daughter using a dna test and from that @entity1 ’s nationality is inferred , because her mum is @entity9			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity145 said : ‘ while we sympathise with ms @entity1 ’s situation , the @entity145 can only issue @entity9 passports to @entity9 citizens			1
‘ we are offering advice to help her provide alternative supporting documents when she applies for her passport			0

@entity1 , 25 , was born in @entity10 to @entity9 parents and moved to @entity4 when she was four
