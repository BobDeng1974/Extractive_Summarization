they are two of the richest and most famous men in @entity2			0
but it appears that sir @entity4 and sir @entity5 may be about to have a falling out with each other			1
the pair are at loggerheads over a farm in the @entity10 which breeds turtles for food			2
the pair are at loggerheads over a farm in the @entity10 which breeds turtles for food last month sir @entity5 threw his weight behind a campaign to end the breeding of sea turtles at @entity24 in the @entity25			1
but after visiting the islands sir @entity4 has now controversially said that he backs the turtle farm			1
a @entity30 ( @entity30 ) investigation has accused the facility of cruelty and former @entity33 sir @entity5 believes there is no humane way to farm turtles			1
but sir @entity4 has now come out in favour of the farm despite saying that his view will attract criticism from the @entity42 group which looks at addressing world problems			1
in an interview with @entity46 news channel sir @entity4 said : ' i have n’t actually visited the farm but i have asked an awful lot of questions while i have been here			1
' from afar i was against the farm			0
i have listened to people locally and i personally think the farm is a good idea and the reason i think that is you are one of the few countries that ban the killing of the turtles in the ocean so turtles are protected in the ocean			0
campaigner : last month sir @entity5 threw his support behind a campaign to end the breeding sea turtles for food ' in the @entity68 you can catch turtles and drag them out of the sea and the turtle farm avoids that having to happen			1
' the second thing is the turtle farm is one of your biggest tourist attractions			2
it does supply a little bit of food for the people who traditionally have liked to eat turtle meat and i think there are some improvements that can be made to the farm but all in all i think it serves a positive need rather than a negative need			0
' i am sure i will get some criticism from the @entity42 when i go back for taking that stance but that is what i believe from being here			0
' on his blog he added : ' what i ’ve learnt from my visit is that unlike many other islands in the @entity10 , the government have banned the hunting and killing of turtles in the sea			2
' by breeding the turtles on land , they ’ve created the biggest tourist attraction in the @entity25 and satisfied the few locals who continue to eat turtles as part of their age - old tradition			0
' obviously for many of us around the world we ’d prefer that did n’t happen but in my opinion it ’s certainly better than taking them from the sea			0
' i 've met the chief minister about the farm and he agrees there are some improvements that need to be made			0
' there are still too many kept in one tank at a time and the farm needs to ensure there are regular checks of the water quality and also monitor the health of the turtles			0
' the local experts assured me changes were happening and the farm also releases a lot into the ocean which is building up the numbers in the wild			0
' all in all i believe the @entity25 do a fine job protecting their oceans , as well as the turtles and other species in them			0
there is still more to do but there are many bigger battles for the @entity144 and @entity30 to fight			0
' last month sir @entity5 threw his support behind a campaign to end the breeding of sea turtles for food			1
the facility in the @entity25 was identified by officials at the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) as the world ’s last surviving commercial turtle farm			1
staff at the base breed the endangered marine reptiles for human consumption , and @entity33 star joined the @entity30 ’s campaign to end the trade			2
in a post on his official website , @entity5 wrote : ' the @entity24 is the last place on @entity164 that breeds endangered sea turtles for food			1
on @entity167 , he added : ' there is no humane way to farm sea turtles			1
