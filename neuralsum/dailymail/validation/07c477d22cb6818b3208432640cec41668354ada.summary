@entity0 was likened to @entity2 propagandist @entity1 last night as he was forced to backtrack over a call to scrap most of @entity5 ’s race relations laws			1
the @entity7 leader prompted a storm of controversy by suggesting he wanted to reverse legislation dating back to the 1960s which bars discrimination at work on the grounds of race or colour			1
his remarks were condemned by the leaders of the other three main parties			2
@entity20 said mr @entity0 appeared ‘ desperate for attention ’ , while @entity21 said the comments were ‘ wrong , divisive and dangerous ’			1
@entity24 said mr @entity0 created fear by confusing ideas			2
@entity35 - born conservative mp for @entity36 - on - @entity38 @entity37 , a member of the no 10 policy board , told @entity40 : ‘ the remark i found most difficult , and certainly hurt by , [ is when ] he talks about employers being able to discriminate in favour of @entity5 - born citizens			1
‘ i was n’t born in @entity5 , but i feel equally @entity5 to @entity0 or anyone else			1
these remarks make me feel very frightened that a man like @entity0 , who aspires to lead the country , who says that he ’s leading a serious party , actually takes the attitude that if you are not @entity5 - born , you ’re not equal			1
it ’s a dog whistle			0
' it ’s a remark @entity1 would be proud of			1
his remarks are deeply racist			0
he should withdraw and apologise			0
’ last night the @entity7 leader claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he did not want to scrap anti- discrimination legislation			1
instead , he focused on less controversial suggestions that firms should be allowed to favour @entity5 job applicants			0
he said : ‘ what i am saying is very simple : i ’m saying that i think @entity5 companies should be allowed the presumption of favouring @entity5 applicants for jobs over those from southern and eastern @entity68			0
’ both @entity70 and @entity71 politicians , notably former prime minister @entity72 , have made similar proposals of a system of ‘ @entity5 jobs for @entity5 workers ’			0
the row erupted after mr @entity0 , interviewed by @entity78 , the former chairman of the @entity79 , for a @entity81 documentary to be screened next week , said @entity5 faced an ‘ especial problem ’ with some @entity84 immigrants			2
@entity35 - born @entity71 mp for @entity36 - on - @entity38 @entity37 compared the @entity7 leader to @entity1 while @entity20 said he was ' desperate for attention ' ‘ people do see a fifth column living within our country , who hate us and want to kill us , ’ he said			1
mr @entity0 then suggested that race and other anti-discrimination laws could be abolished on the grounds that people were now ‘ colour blind ’			1
pressed on which legislation he would get rid of , the @entity7 leader said : ‘ much of it			1
’ asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour if @entity7 were ever in power , mr @entity0 added : ‘ no … because we take the view , we are colour blind			1
we as a party are colour blind			0
‘ i think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who she or he employs			0
i think the situation that we now have , where an employer is not allowed to choose between a @entity5 - born person and somebody from @entity117 , is a ludicrous state of affairs			1
‘ i would argue that the law does need changing , and that if an employer wishes to choose , or you can use the word “ discriminate ” if you want to , but wishes to choose to employ a @entity5 - born person , they should be allowed to do so			1
’ in the @entity81 interview : @entity78 : ‘ in @entity125 there would be no law against discrimination on the grounds of nationality			0
would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour ? ’ @entity0 : ‘ no. we are colour blind			2
we as a party are colour blind			0
’ yesterday : @entity0 : ‘ i did n’t mention race at all – it was no part of that interview with @entity78 at all … i am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws in @entity5			2
’ challenged later about his remarks , the @entity7 leader appeared to reverse his position , insisting : ‘ i did n’t mention race at all			1
i am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws			0
i ’m talking about lightening employment legislation so that small employers – and do n’t forget , there are nearly five million in @entity5 – are less fearful of taking on young @entity5 workers			0
’ mr @entity0 suggested his critics were racist , rather than him , since they assumed he meant ‘ white ’ when he talked about ‘ @entity5 ’ workers , while he insisted his proposed changes would help ‘ young black and white @entity5 people ’			2
last night the prime minister said : ‘ what @entity0 has said is completely wrong and , frankly , pretty appalling			2
the reason these laws are in place is to stop people being discriminated against on the basis of the colour of their skin			0
’ @entity160 , @entity70 ’s shadow justice secretary , said : ‘ this is one of the most shocking things i have ever heard from a mainstream politician , and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance			0
‘ we have made huge progress on tackling racial inequality and discrimination in this country , but things are still far from perfect			0
‘ when my parents moved to @entity173 [ from @entity174 ] they frequently saw signs saying “ no blacks , no dogs , no @entity178 ”			0
what @entity7 is suggesting would take us back to those days			2
