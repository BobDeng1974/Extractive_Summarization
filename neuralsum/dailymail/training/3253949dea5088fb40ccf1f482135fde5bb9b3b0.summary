scientists have long wondered if life really does exist on @entity2			1
and a new set of pictures released by @entity5 could appear to confirm conspiracy theorists ' claims that we are not alone in the universe			1
the images taken by a @entity5 navigation camera have been released and appear to show a human - like figure working on the @entity13 , which is scanning the @entity2			1
the shadow formed shows what looks like a male figure , who is n't wearing a helmet as his short spiky hair is visible			0
it also looks like the figure is wearing an air tank on his back and a suit covering most of his body			0
the pictures have been reported to the monitoring website @entity38 sightings daily , and have sent conspiracy theorists into overdrive , with some claiming it is proof life does exist on @entity2			1
it comes after @entity44 , an alleged computer hacker , who reportedly obtained classified documents from the @entity48 government , claimed he found files showing the existence of ' extra-terrestrial officers '			0
it is claimed the pictures show a man , without a helmet is looming over the probe fixing it , wearing a full body suit and wearing an air tank on his back however , others have claimed that the @entity13 might not even be on @entity2 and that it has remained on @entity61 with humans cleaning it and performing maintenance			1
but some insist the shadow is just coincidence and that conspiracy theorists are only seeing the figure because it confirms their expectations and hopes			0
@entity72 , author of the @entity73 , said : ' this underlines the fact that such things literally lurk in the shadows and play with our imagination			0
' it comes after it was announced in december that an instrument on the @entity13 had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface of @entity2			2
the @entity13 , which is currently probing the @entity2 to try and determine if there has ever been any life forms there the new discovery , reported in the journal @entity92 , followed studies of gas samples by @entity13 's @entity95 ( @entity95 ) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis			1
it revealed a low background level of methane , which spiked 10-fold over a period of just 60 @entity2 days			0
while there are non-biological explanations , experts suggested that its finding may be a sign of life on @entity2			0
the @entity13 , is a probe designed to help with long - term exploration of the @entity2			2
its aim is to assess whether the planet has ever had an environment , which has been able to support small life forms and to determine whether the planet could be habitable .			2

new pictures have been released by @entity5 showing @entity13
the probe is currently on the @entity2 scanning for signs of life forms
the images appear to show what some have called a ' human - like ' figure
they say it shows a workman leaning over the space probe and fixing it
add that it shows that there is proof that life on @entity2 does exist
but scientists say the shadows are just a play on theorists ' imagination
