by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham for newly - promoted clubs the start of the @entity2 season brings with it a mixture of excitement and nerves			1
after a year of winning regularly , the celebrations at the end of the campaign and optimism over the summer , they will generally face a very different prospect over the proceeding eight months			0
here , @entity13 gives you a run - down on the three sides promoted from the championship and how they could fare			0
manager @entity30 described it as ‘ historic ’ after they finished eight points above third - placed @entity34 with a threadbare squad			0
players in : @entity37 , from @entity38 , £ 1million @entity39 , from @entity40 , free @entity41 , from @entity42 , free @entity43 , from @entity44 , £ 500,000 @entity45 , from @entity46 , free @entity47 , from @entity48 , £ 1.5million players out : @entity49 , to @entity50 , free @entity51 , to @entity46 , free @entity52 : £ 3m new boys : @entity54 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) are two of six summer signings at @entity25 one player they need : they desperately require a centre - back			1
their pairing of @entity61 and @entity62 were solid last year but noway near @entity2 quality			2
anyone with some top flight experience will help their cause			0
@entity68 : @entity69 – the hit - man netted 26 times in 45 games last season and remains with @entity25 despite interest from other top - flight clubs			1
finishing position : 20 word on the @entity77 : @entity78 worked miracles to get them promoted , spending money on just one player from when he joined the club in 2012 to helping them finish second			1
it is going to take something even more special to keep them up on a comparatively minuscule budget again			0
one reason to be cheerful : the squad – with only 22 first - team players last season – has been bulked up with six new signings			1
making @entity37 ’s move permanent is a great piece of business and he could be a real attacking outlet for them this season			0
one reason to be fearful : do the rest of the signings have the quality to keep them up ? @entity43 has failed to make an impact in the top flight in the past and the the likes of @entity41 and @entity45 are merely unwanted by other clubs			0
@entity111 ask : @entity78 will do well to keep @entity25 in the @entity2 after guiding them to promotion @entity21 ended their 10 - year absence from the top flight by running away with the @entity117 title			1
they were promoted by the beginning of april with a club record 102 points and 31 victories , nine points clear of second - place @entity25			1
players in : @entity125 , from @entity126 , free @entity127 , from @entity128 , free @entity129 , from @entity126 , free @entity130 , from @entity128 , £ 8million players out : @entity131 , to @entity34 , free @entity132 , to @entity44 , free @entity133 , to @entity134 , free @entity52 : £ 8million pressure : @entity130 ( centre ) will be expected to score goals after arriving from @entity128 for £ 8million one player they need : another quality striker is essential			1
the club are interested in @entity141 , but @entity142 are holding out for a sum similar to the one paid for @entity130			1
@entity68 : @entity144 – has the potential to be one of the best goalkeepers in the league next season and could be crucial to keeping out the opposition while sustaining heavy pressure			0
predicted finishing position : 17 word on the @entity77 : after securing the services manager @entity22 and sensational stopper @entity144 on new deals , fans are optimistic about survival			2
however , significant transfer funds have been splashed out on a striker with no @entity2 experience and they will be relying on him to start firing quickly			1
one reason to be cheerful : the way they stormed to the @entity117 title should give the players huge confidence going into the @entity2 campaign			2
they must maintain that momentum if they want any chance of staying in the league			0
one reason to be fearful : if they fail to stay up , top - flight clubs will be all over their best players and the likes of @entity144 and @entity175 could move elsewhere , making it even harder to get back up again			2
safe hands : goalkeeper @entity144 has the ability to play a crucial role in @entity21 's survival bid @entity181 they did it the hard way			1
@entity19 ’s side , full of players with @entity2 experience , were expected to run away with the league , but they finished fourth and eventually won promotion via the play - offs			1
players in : @entity192 , from @entity126 , free @entity193 , from @entity194 , £ 8million @entity195 , from @entity194 , £ 6million players out : @entity196 , to @entity197 , free @entity198 , to @entity128 , free @entity199 , to @entity200 , £ 2.1million @entity52 : £ 11.9million defensive duo : @entity192 ( left ) and @entity193 ( right ) have both been brought to @entity202 one player they need : a striker to partner the prolific @entity204 who can score goals in the top flight but is not prone to injury			1
if @entity19 can convince @entity208 to stay and integrate him back into the side , he could well be the answer to their problems			0
@entity68 : @entity204 – scored 20 goals in 37 appearances last year despite struggling midway through the season with injury			0
his raw instinct as a striker means he has been crying out for a chance in the @entity2 and could well surprise many teams			2
finishing position : 14 word on the @entity77 : @entity192 and @entity193 are superb acquisitions to create a formidable partnership at the centre of their defence			0
fans are wary of their relegation in 2012 , when they were not expected to go down but crashed out of the league , but more quality recruitments will settle their nerves			0
one reason to be cheerful : they have a manager with huge top - flight experience and the foundations of a @entity2 team are already in place			2
provided @entity19 can get the balance right , and bring in a few more faces , they should comfortably stay in the league			0
one reason to be fearful : they were never supposed to get relegated in the first place			0
although @entity19 was not in charge for the whole season he still did n’t manage to keep them up and they were one of the surprise departures the season before last			2
video new teams wo n't break into top seven - @entity19 experienced : manager @entity19 will be well prepared to keep @entity181 in the top - flight next season			1

all three clubs are preparing for the new @entity2 season
@entity21 and @entity25 earned automatic promotion last season , while @entity181 came up via the play - offs
@entity19 has spent £ *14million* on new players this summer
@entity22 bought striker @entity130 for a club record £ 8million
@entity78 has signed six players for just £ *3million* so far
