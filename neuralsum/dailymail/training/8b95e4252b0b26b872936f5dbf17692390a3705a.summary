this the final photograph of poisoned spy @entity1 , taken as he was dying in hospital shortly before he lost consciousness for the last time			0
the public inquiry into his death heard today that mr @entity1 agreed to have pictures taken during his final days , so that the world could see how ' he was poisoned by the @entity8 '			1
his friend @entity9 told the hearing that the image , which shows him gaunt and obviously gravely ill , was the last ever taken before he died from radiation poisoning at @entity13			1
the inquiry was also told mr @entity1 had a ' feeling ' that two @entity17 men were planning to murder him during the meeting in which he drank tea laced with plutonium			1
he met the two men at the @entity36 in central @entity37 on november 1 , 2006 , and drank a few sips of tea which later turned out to be poisoned , the hearing was told			1
@entity40 , a now - retired @entity41 , told the long - awaited public inquiry today that he interviewed mr @entity43 , 43 , over three days in @entity13 , where he died three weeks after the hotel meeting			1
mr @entity1 said he drank tea from a silver teapot in the presence of @entity31 , without @entity32 , but it was ' nearly cold ' and he did not like the taste so only took three or four sips			1
@entity31 then left the hotel with his family to watch a football match between @entity54 and @entity56 match at the @entity57 in north @entity37			1
suspects : @entity32 , left , and @entity31 , right , have been accused of murdering the @entity17 spy fatal : mr @entity1 drank polonium - laced tea during a meeting at the @entity36 , pictured evidence : former police officer @entity40 , pictured , interviewed mr @entity1 three times while the former @entity17 spy was dying in hospital ' when i left the hotel i was thinking there is something strange , ' mr @entity1 told police			1
' i had been feeling all the time i knew that they wanted to kill me			0
' the @entity17 dissident , who was apparently working for @entity74 after fleeing his home country , later described how he rapidly fell ill and worked out that he was a victim of poisoning			1
' the vomiting did n't stop and i started having foam out my mouth and also bits of stomach with blood started coming out , ' he told police			2
' and i realised i had been poisoned			0
' mr @entity1 was also asked about a meeting he had with an unidentified man at @entity87 branch on october 31 - the day before the suspected poisoning			2
it is now understood that man was ' @entity90 ' , an @entity74 officer to whom mr @entity1 reported			2
the @entity17 dissident , who fled to the @entity91 in 2000 and claimed asylum before becoming a @entity91 citizen , drank hot chocolate and ate three pastries , while the man drank a coffee , the inquiry heard			1
mr @entity40 said that mr @entity1 's health had ' very clearly ' deteriorated during the three days of police interviews			0
the inquiry also heard that @entity101 cut the amount of money he was paying to support the @entity1 family after hearing that the spy was working for @entity74			1
family : mr @entity1 's son @entity107 and widow @entity109 outside the @entity110 @entity111 is an ultra-rare radioactive element which was discovered by @entity113 and @entity114 in 1898 , and named after @entity114 's home country of @entity116 , which was not then an independent state			1
in the natural world it occurs as a part of uranium ore , and must be extracted through a laborious process in which many tonnes of ore may be needed to produce just a few milligrammes of polonium			0
even a tiny amount costs tens of millions of pounds to make - around the world , no more than 100g of polonium is produced each year			0
the radiation emitted by polonium is in the form of alpha particles , meaning that handling the substance poses little danger because the particles can not pass through human skin			0
however , once polonium is ingested it spreads throughout the body causing acute radiation syndrome , which leads to severe illness and eventually death			0
@entity1 is the only person ever known to have been poisoned with polonium - he ingested the element 's most common isotope , polonium - 210 , dissolved into a pot of tea			0
mr @entity9 , a dissident who was close to both mr @entity1 and the billionaire tycoon he was once ordered to assassinate , said that mr @entity101 had paid $ 130,000 ( Â£ 85,000 ) to bring the @entity150 to the @entity91			0
he continued to fund mr @entity43 once he had settled in @entity37 , but halved the money he gave his friend when the @entity74 connection became apparent , mr @entity9 said			2
he added that @entity74 were ' not happy ' about mr @entity1 's friendship with mr @entity101 , who was found dead at his @entity156 mansion two years ago in an apparent suicide			2
mr @entity9 , a molecular biologist who became a political activist , claimed that he had been ' barred from entering the @entity91 ' after helping to expedite mr @entity1 's flight from @entity17			0
yesterday mr @entity1 's widow @entity160 told the inquiry , which opened last week eight years after his death , that the last words she ever heard him say were ' i love you so much '			0
she said that during mr @entity1 's illness his hair was so thin that when she stroked his head clumps were coming off in her hand			0
the couple 's son @entity107 , 20 , also gave evidence , saying that he never believed his father would die despite his rapid illness			0
@entity31 and @entity176 have both refused to give evidence to the inquiry at the @entity110 , insisting they had no involvement in mr @entity1 's death			1
the inquiry has previously been told that the spy was one of @entity184 's fiercest critics , and had allegedly been told that the @entity17 government was planning to murder him			2

@entity1 drank tea laced with polonium while meeting @entity31 and @entity32 at a @entity37 hotel
fell ill later that day and died of radiation poisoning three weeks later
he later told police ' i knew they wanted to kill me ' as soon as he left hotel
two @entity17 have refused to give evidence to public inquiry
