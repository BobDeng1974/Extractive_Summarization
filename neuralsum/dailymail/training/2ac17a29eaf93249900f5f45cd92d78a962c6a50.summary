a mother - of - three diagnosed with an ' inoperable ' brain tumour has defied medics after undergoing radical surgery in the @entity4 to have it successfully removed - and could now live another 15 years			1
@entity6 was just 37 when she was given the devastating diagnosis after developing pains in her neck			2
the nurse was told the tumour was benign but that it was too deep within her brain to operate - and she had between just three to 12 months to live			1
an attempted biopsy also caused her to have a bleed on the brain , temporarily paralysing her down her right side @entity28 doctors in @entity29 and @entity30 told her the tumour was like a ' spider wrapping round her brain ' and warned her there was nothing more they could do			1
instead , they tried to manage her condition with chemotherapy and radiotherapy - which proved unsuccessful			1
but the now 39 - year - old refused to give up for the sake of her three boys and researched alternative treatments not provided on the @entity28 or privately in @entity41			1
mrs @entity42 , and husband @entity14 , 41 , a police officer , found a pioneering treatment available in the @entity4 for £ 80,000 called ' awake craniotomy with mapping '			1
without hesitation , she flew to @entity50 two weeks ago			0
last wednesday she underwent the procedure - which involved cutting open a slice of skull - while awake			1
incredibly , to avoid injury to her language , motor and sensory functions , she had to recite her children 's names and birthday 's so during surgery			0
@entity28 doctors in @entity29 and @entity30 told mrs @entity42 the tumour was like a ' spider wrapping round her brain ' and warned her there was nothing more they could do instead , mrs @entity42 , and husband @entity14 , 41 , a police officer , found a pioneering treatment available in the @entity4 for £ 80,000 called ' awake craniotomy with mapping and after the five hour operation at @entity73 she was delighted to be told doctors had successfully removed 100 per cent of the enhanced tumour			1
doctors say the surgery could have extended her life by up to 15 years			1
mrs @entity42 , from @entity79 , near @entity80 , @entity81 , said she was desperate to survive so she could be there for her children she said : ' it was a choice of giving up or fighting and i am not a defeatist			0
' i could n't just give up when i have three young children who need me to be there for them			0
' i think anyone in my position would do the same and fight as hard as they can to stay alive			0
' she and her husband said they were left with no option after a 42 - day course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed to get her condition under control			1
an attempted biopsy caused her to have a bleed on the brain and temporarily paralyse her down her right side			2
a scan then showed the tumour 's progression had not slowed			0
after meeting a doctor at the @entity73 , in @entity50 , she took the brave decision to undertake the radical surgery last week after the five - hour operation at @entity73 she was delighted to be told doctors had successfully removed 100 per cent of the enhanced tumour - which could extend her life by up to 15 years consultants admitted they had run out of ideas and encouraged her to look for more radical treatment elsewhere			1
after meeting a doctor at the @entity73 , she took the brave decision to undertake the radical surgery			0
mrs @entity6 added : ' i had private healthcare , so it was n't about taking money out of the @entity28 , just about their belief in my chances of survival which they thought were virtually nothing			2
' i have to admit it was a risk and i was really scared because i had to remain awake throughout the surgery so they could check my brain was functioning normally			2
' but you do what you have to do to survive			0
' mrs @entity6 is now fundraising to pay for treatment , not covered by health insurance she is now recovering in hospital and is expected to return to the @entity41 soon			1
but the family is now left with a crippling bill of £ 80,000 for @entity4 surgery , not covered by @entity41 private healthcare			1
mr @entity6 has been forced to stay in the country to look after the couple 's three children - @entity16 , 8 , @entity17 , 7 , and @entity18 , 4			0
he said : ' you ca n't put a price on life			0
nowhere else does this kind of procedure because it is so tricky and risky - but i could n't be prouder of how brave she has been			2
' she was awake the whole time while they sliced open her skull and removed the tumour			1
' the whole time they asked her to count and recite the boy 's birthdays and names , so that they did n't disturb a part of the brain that deals with her memory			0
' but she 's speaking fine and they said they had removed it ok , so it looks like its been successful			2
' me and the boys just want her back home now			0
' to meet the steep cost of surgery , @entity6 's local community has begun a @entity179 campaign entitled £ onebravemummy to raise awareness of her situation and raise money to help the family			0
they have helped raise more than £ 7,000 online in a matter of days as the campaign gains momentum			0
any donations to help pay for @entity6 's treatment can be made via the @entity192 page when a tumor is near critical speech areas of the brain , it may be important to determine the exact location of these speech - related areas although functional @entity200 ( @entity201 ) can show the various areas of activation during speech functions , it does not pinpoint the most important areas			1
these critical areas must be located using special speech mapping techniques while the patient is awake in the operating room			2
awake speech mapping involves applying mild electrical current to the surface of the exposed brain while the patient performs various tasks , such as reading			1
if the stimulation hinders the task , then that area of the brain is marked and preserved			0
how a sleep - awake - sleep craniotomy works the operation is begun while the patient is deeply asleep under general anesthesia ( on a breathing machine )			1
this is for the comfort of the patient and is safer			0
when the brain is exposed and the neurosurgeon is ready to begin mapping the speech areas , neuroanesthesiologists carefully lighten the sedation , and then remove the breathing tube and allow the patient to talk and interact with the neuropsychologist			2
typically , the patients feel minimal or no discomfort while awake once the speech mapping is complete , often the tumor is removed while the speech testing continues			2
the procedure lessens the risk of undercutting the white matter fibers connecting speech areas			0
when appropriate , the anesthesiologist skillfully places the patient back under general ( deep ) anesthesia , allowing the neurosurgeon to complete the operation safely with no discomfort to the patient			0

@entity256 was just 37 when she was given the diagnosis
told tumour was benign but too deep within her brain to operate
chemotherapy and radiotherapy proved unsuccessful for mother - of - three
instead , @entity28 doctors *advised* her to try other radical treatments elsewhere
last week underwent £ 80,000 ' awake craniotomy with mapping ' in the @entity4
procedure was successful and removed 100 *%* of the tumour , ' doctors say
her life *expectancy* could now be extended by up to 15 years
is now fundraising to pay for treatment , not covered by health insurance
