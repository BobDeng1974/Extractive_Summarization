by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 28 may 2013 an international field of daredevils today defied health and safety zealots to tumble down a hill as they took part in the annual @entity9 competition			1
rebel rollers again staged their own unofficial event after the world - famous competition , which sees thrill seekers chase an 8lb piece of @entity16 down a steep hill , was cancelled in 2010			1
organisers behind the event at @entity9 in @entity20 , @entity21 , had this year replaced the cheese with a lightweight foam version in order to make the downhill race safer			1
the bizarre annual event attracts participants , spectators and media from across the world			1
around 4,000 spectators basked in the blazing sunshine to watch around a dozen daredevil athletes pursue the ‘ cheese ’ 200 metres down the 1:2 gradient slope of grass , brambles and nettles			1
competitors slip , somersault and tumble their way to the bottom in spectacular fashion during the bone - crunching races - and the first person to grab the cheese wins			1
ouch : an enthusiastic roller loses control of her limbs as she hurtles down the hill in pursuit of the elusive @entity16 do n't look now : one man shuts his eyes as he falls down the hill			1
competitors try to stay on their feet for as long as possible in the race @entity81 : competitors brace themselves as they hit the ground on their descent of @entity9			2
many are injured during the event last week it was revealed police had warned cheesemaker @entity89 not to supply the @entity90 for the race because she might be held liable for any injuries suffered by chasers			0
but although today 's races did finish with an ambulance being called to a man with a suspected broken leg , there were no other serious injuries			0
@entity100 , whose soldier son @entity101 could not defend his chasing crown today because he is on a military training exercise in @entity104 , said the police should not have spent money on a helicopter to watch the event			0
watching on : spectators line the slope for the annual @entity9 event at @entity111 near @entity20 winner : @entity113 ( left ) celebrates victory in the first race of the event , which was a fierce battle ( right ) in front : @entity118 from @entity20 leads the field in the ladies race of the annual @entity9 event ‘ they are probably up there filming everything so that next year they have ammunition to try to get the cheese rolling banned , ’ he said			1
‘ but although there are far more people here than there have been at the unofficial races last year and the year before there is nothing for the police to worry about			0
‘ everyone is behaving themselves			0
it shows that this event can take place without marshals , security men , emergency services and expensive insurance			0
’ @entity145 , 25 , has been the main winner of the races over the last five years and has claimed 13 cheeses in that time			0
he intended to defend his record today , watched by his platoon from 1 @entity151			1
on his way to victory : the first downhill pursuit was won by jubilant @entity155 @entity113 ( right ) , 27 on the ground : a man falls down the steep gradient of @entity9 during the annual @entity160 tradition fancy dress : competitors take part in the annual @entity9 event at @entity9 in @entity21 but mr @entity165 said his son was ' gutted ' that a six week training exercise in @entity168 had been brought forward from mid-june and he could not take part			1
it left the races wide open to challengers and the first downhill pursuit was won by jubilant @entity155 @entity113 , 27 , from @entity173 , @entity174			0
the estate agent , wearing a morph costume with his hair dyed to match , said : ‘ i 've come especially for this and it feels great to win			0
dangerous : around 4,000 spectators basked in the blazing sunshine to watch around a dozen daredevil athletes pursue the ' cheese ' 200 metres down the 1:2 gradient slope of grass , brambles and nettles challenging : competitors slip , somersault and tumble their way to the bottom in spectacular fashion during the bone - crunching races - and the first person to grab the cheese wins popular : three years ago the official cheese rolling event was cancelled when about 15,000 people tried to attend - causing widespread traffic jams and concern about public safety on the treacherous hillside ' i 've been training a long time for it - running up and down the ski slopes in @entity174			1
as soon as i saw this event on tv i put it on my bucket list to do			0
‘ we are celebrating @entity211 today , remembering all soldiers who have given the ultimate sacrifice for their countries , and i want to dedicate my win to them , to all the soldiers everywhere			0
‘ i got a great start at the top of the hill and i just kept going			2
as far as i know i am the first @entity155 to hold a cheese high here			2
’ three years ago the official @entity9 event was cancelled when about 15,000 people tried to attend - causing widespread traffic jams and concern about public safety on the treacherous hillside			1
the @entity226 disbanded and it appeared the tradition was at an end			0
but locals thought otherwise and have kept it going			0
helping out : paramedics tend to an injured man who broke his leg at the @entity9 event at @entity9 treatment : although today 's races did finish with an ambulance being called to a man with a suspected broken leg , there were no other serious injuries rescuers : an injured man who broke his leg at the annual event is helped down the cliff on a stretcher since then interest has been growing and today there was the biggest turnout yet for the unofficial races - partly fuelled by publicity about the police telling mrs @entity89 not to supply cheeses			2
despite the police intervention , there were plenty of cheeses for competitors to chase today			2
wearing a t - shirt bearing the message ' and we roll again 2013 ' , an organiser who gave her name only as @entity259 said : ‘ we 've made some dummy cheeses out of sponge to roll down the hill so they are lighter and less dangerous			1
‘ but we have real cheeses for the winners			0
you do n't have to tell someone selling cheese what you want it for , do you ? ‘ we are determined to keep this traditional event going every year and we 're very grateful to all the people who have turned out to support us			2
