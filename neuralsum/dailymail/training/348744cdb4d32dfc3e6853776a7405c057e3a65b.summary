@entity0 will step up their search for a new head coach on sunday morning after caretaker boss @entity3 and his team were booed off following defeat at @entity6			1
@entity3 , who took over in temporary charge from @entity8 on monday , insists he still wants the job full - time			1
but the fans ’ reaction to saturday ’s dismal defeat will not have helped his case and it is believed @entity15 and @entity16 are front - runners to fill the vacancy			1
but he said : ‘ i ’d be a fool if i did n’t want to be head coach of this club			2
obviously results dictates that happens but i do n’t feel any different			2
i still want to be head coach			2
‘ i ’ve not spoken to @entity34 and my only communication has been with [ managing director ] @entity43 on monday night and a short conversation last night just about the game today			0
‘ it will be confusing [ to fans ] but the only thing i will say is that the position is not now as a manager — it ’s now a head coach ’s job			0
so the head coach ’s job is to get the team ready and prepared for the next game and that ’s all i ’ve been thinking about			0
’ the likelihood is that the 49 - year - old will still be in charge for next saturday ’s trip to @entity60 but the manner of the @entity25 exit could accelerate the process of finding a permanent successor			1
@entity15 , who has done an excellent job at @entity66 , is likely to be at the top of any shortlist , alongside @entity16 and former @entity70 boss @entity69			1
@entity71 manager @entity16 , who has @entity73 experience with @entity74 and @entity60 , is in the frame former @entity76 manager @entity15 has been working wonders with @entity78 former @entity70 manager @entity69 is also said to be under consideration by the @entity0 board but @entity15 on sunday tried to distance himself from the vacancy following his team ’s 1 - 0 win against @entity84			1
‘ i ’ve dismissed that link and i ’m sticking to that , ’ he said			0
and @entity78 chief executive @entity87 issued a hands - off warning on saturday : ' there is no question whatsoever of him leaving			0
' he is one of the highest - performing managers in @entity93 football , so he is going to be linked and admired by others			0
but we have had no approaches			0
' @entity3 said @entity0 fans were within their rights to protest so audibly , with some also furiously gesturing for the players to go away rather than applaud			1
‘ it ’s hugely embarrassing but they ’re entitled to do that , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 are searching for a new boss following @entity8 *'s* departure
@entity3 *dented* his chances by crashing out of the @entity25 to @entity6
