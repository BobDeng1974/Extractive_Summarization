' heartbroken ' : @entity8 claims her dreams of motherhood have been ruined after she got food poisoning from chicken bought at @entity7 mrs @entity8 , a travel agent , and her husband believe the campylobacter gastroenteretis caused by eating the rotisserie chicken was responsible for her failure to become pregnant			1
and they fear that after having now used both her @entity27 cycles available free on the @entity28 they have lost their last chance to start a family because they ca n’t afford to pay for private fertility treatment			0
the couple had been hopeful of success after their fertilised eggs were transferred successfully to her womb in june 2012 , as the previous cycle of @entity27 had resulted in mrs @entity8 becoming pregnant , though she later miscarried			1
mrs @entity8 began to feel unwell after eating the chicken on july 2 , bought from @entity7 ’s store at @entity41 , near @entity42 , two days after the @entity27 treatment			1
soon after , she suffered severe diarrhoea			0
a couple of days later her gp sent her to @entity47 where she was placed on a drip for two nights			0
days later she was told she had lost the embryos			2
dashed hopes : mrs @entity8 , 41 , was overjoyed when doctors successfully transferred two embryos into her womb			1
but two days later she became severely ill after developing food poisoning caused by the chicken bought from @entity7 after contacting @entity58 law firm @entity56 issued a civil claim against @entity7			1
the supermarket admitted liability in relation to the food poisoning last summer but has not admitted that this resulted in the loss of the embryos			1
the couple are now pursuing a compensation claim			0
' it is just devastating for us , ' said mrs @entity8 , from @entity42			0
' we had suffered years of heartache and frustration and believed we would finally be able to start a family of our own			0
' it was such a crushing blow for us , as realistically it was our last chance			0
' we are no longer entitled to @entity27 on the @entity28 and we can not afford to pay for it privately , so we hoped @entity7 would help - but they turned us down			2
' when they told me the embryos had failed i was heartbroken , i knew it was my last chance as we simply can not afford to do it privately and at 41 , my chance of success are plummeting every day			2
' an environmental health officer from @entity80 visited the chicken counter at the @entity7 store in @entity41 and noted a number of potential health concerns including poor handling of raw chicken and insufficient cleaning practices of preparation surfaces			2
once she knew the cause of her illness , mrs @entity8 decided to write to @entity7 and in the hope that the supermarket giant would cover the cost of a new cycle of @entity27			1
despair : days after suffering food poisoning , she was told the fertility procedure had failed mrs @entity8 said : @entity8 said : ' there is no way we can afford the £ 3,000 to have another round of @entity27 so i hope that @entity7 will do the decent thing and pay for it for us			1
' @entity105 is not on our side so i hope something can be resolved as soon as possible before our dreams of having a family have gone for good			0
' but dr @entity110 , a consultant gynaecologist in the @entity28 and at the @entity111 and @entity112 , said it is unlikely the food poisoning affected the success of mrs @entity8 's @entity27			1
he told @entity116 : ' it is impossible to prove what effect the food poisoning had			1
but it is very unlikely to have affected it , in my opinion			0
' the vast majority of women at her age who have embryos put back in would have a negative pregnancy test			0
' at 41 , there is only about a 20 - 25 per cent chance she would have a positive pregnancy test - and a 15 to 20 per cent chance of taking home a baby			0
claim : mrs @entity8 is now hoping @entity7 will fund another round of @entity27 , as she has used up her allowance on the @entity28			2
but doctors have warned her age is against her ' as a woman ages , there is a higher chance of the embyros being abnormal and not implanting			0
' @entity143 , personal injury lawyer at @entity144 , who is representing @entity8 , said : ' this has been a harrowing experience for @entity148 and her partner			0
' their expectations of a pregnancy running to full term were cruelly destroyed by @entity7 ’s simple failure to follow straightforward food hygiene requirements			2
' they can take some comfort though from @entity7 ’s final acceptance of their wrongdoing and we are now focused on getting them the best compensation settlement to allow them a chance of fulfilling their dream of having a child			0
' a spokesperson for @entity7 said : ' providing safe food is our absolute priority , and we have thorough cleaning routines to maintain the highest standards in our stores			2
' we listen carefully to any complaint that we failed to meet our very high standards and as soon as we became aware of mrs @entity8 's complaint we took urgent action to check our hygiene and cleaning routines			2
we are working to resolve her complaint			0

@entity8 had two embryos successfully transferred into her womb
but two days later became severely ill from food poisoning
days later was told the fertility procedure had failed
she firmly believes the poisoning from rotisserie chicken is to blame
but doctors argue her age is the most likely reason the procedure failed
she is now taking legal action after @entity7 refused to pay for more *ivf*
