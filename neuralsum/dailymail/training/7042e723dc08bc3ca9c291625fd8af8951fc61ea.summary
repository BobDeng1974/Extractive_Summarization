despite being on air almost continuously since the 1950s , @entity13 is still a tv favourite because children are bored of watching tv shows that ‘ preach ’ and ‘ moralise ’ , its latest boss has claimed			2
@entity18 , who took over @entity1 and his sidekicks sweep and @entity20 in 1999 , said the teddy bear ’s mischievous character appeals to toddlers who are bored by more ‘ health and safety conscious ’ shows			1
the 44 - year - old said : ‘ @entity1 has a niche			1
it works because of the old fashioned slapstick humour			1
the gunk and the custard pies			0
most children ’s programmes nowadays are very health and safety conscious			2
‘ we get away with stuff others ca n’t			0
@entity1 is naughty and impolite			1
' and while other shows are worried about setting a good example to the young , we just want to make children scream with laughter			2
i ’m not trying to preach or moralise			0
there is too much of that			0
children get bored of that			0
’ @entity1 ’s character was first created by @entity49 in 1948 , after he bought an old glove puppet for 7s 6d ( 37.5p ) at a novelty shop in @entity53			1

classic : @entity18 , who took over @entity1 and his sidekicks @entity20 and @entity62 in 1999 , believes the character will never get outdated entertaining : mr @entity18 says modern children 's programmes are too ' health and safety conscious ' after a tv production company made a disastrous attempt to turn @entity1 into a cartoon animation , mr @entity18 bought the rights for £ 700,000 and has brought it back to mainstream tv			1

@entity80 – who still regularly speaks to mr @entity18 about the show - said his father loved the character so much he would drill airholes in the box he was kept in while travelling			1
saying @entity1 could go on ‘ forever ’ , he added : ‘ i think the reason for @entity1 ’s success is the simplicity of it , especially in an era where so much television is computer - generated			1
’ mr @entity18 agreed , saying : ‘ children do n’t mind that you can sometimes see a piece of string or someone ’s arm			1
they know @entity1 is not real , but they still want to stroke him and say hello when i do live shows			2
we do it all very frugally , and that is part of the charm			0
@entity1 's character was first created by @entity49 in 1948 , after he bought an old glove puppet for 7s 6d at a novelty shop in @entity53 after making his tv debut in 1952 , @entity1 went on to have the longest running children 's tv show ever ‘ it is a classic old double act , with @entity62 as the slightly foolish sidekick who always gets the blame			1
it was inspired by @entity116 originally			0
@entity20 is the serious older sister			0
lots of children can relate to that			0
’ mr @entity18 revealed there have been more than 6,000 @entity1 puppets in total , used in both the live theatre shows and the tv programmes			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 gets up to so much mischief he does get worn out			2
i go through almost one puppet every episode			0
