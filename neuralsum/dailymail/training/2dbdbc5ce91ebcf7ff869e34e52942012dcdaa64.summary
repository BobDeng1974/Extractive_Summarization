by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 05:30 est , 13 november 2012 while all eyes were on the ipad mini launch launch night , @entity1 tried to steal @entity5 's thunder by allowing the first reviews of its supposed @entity3 killer , called @entity8 , to be published			1
however , the tactic may have backfired			0
the surface tablet , which will cost between £ 399 and £ 559 ( $ 499 to $ 699 in the @entity11 ) when it goes on sale on thursday , was met with a lukewarm response , with reviewers criticising its lack of apps and branding it ' a compromise '			1
the surface is @entity1 's first foray into computer hardware			1
based on a @entity29 chip designed by @entity30 , the @entity8 will run a simplified version of @entity32 that is not compatible with old @entity1 applications			2
however , the tablet will feature new app - style versions of @entity39 mainstays such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , and will include @entity44 games , video and music apps			1
the surface , with two cameras and a usb port , will be @entity50 only			0
even the most positive review , from technology magazine @entity51 , would only go so far as describing the tablet as ' quite good '			0
the price is the same as the cheapest @entity3 , and will put the two firms into a head to head battle			1
@entity60 's @entity59 and @entity63 's @entity62 tablet are also set to be launched or receive updates this week as manufacturers prepare for what many predict will be a ' tablet @entity67 '			2
the surface will go on sale the same day @entity1 releases @entity71 8 , the new version of its desktop computer software			1
experts have described the software as make or break for the company , but say the @entity8 will struggle against the @entity3			1
' it is priced the same as the @entity3 , even though the @entity8 has a higher spec with 32gb rather than the @entity3 's 16gb , ' said @entity80 of gadget website @entity81			1
' however , the consumer is unlikely to understand that - they will simple see that it 's a straight choice between an @entity3 and @entity8 , and i think the majority of people will choose an @entity3 - they just wo n't be aware of a spec fight			1
@entity1 's contribution : the new surface tablet computer has a case that doubles as a keyboard mr @entity80 said the tablet could appeal to owners of @entity1 powered mobile phones			1
' if you 've used @entity99 is easier to use , but not many people have - and people love or hate it			0
' @entity104 : ' @entity105 : this is @entity107 ' ' we had n't looked forward to something this much in a long , long time			0
' now it 's here : and it 's been just as long a time since a gadget has been so disappointing			0
should you buy it ? no. ' the @entity116 ' ( 7/10 ) ' the promise of the @entity8 was that it could deliver a best - in - class tablet experience , but then transform into the pc you needed when heavier lifting was required			2
' instead of putting down my tablet and picking up my laptop , i would just snap on my keyboard and get my work done			0
' but that 's not what the @entity8 offers , at least not in my experience			0
' it does the job of a tablet and the job of a laptop half as well as other devices on the market , and it often makes that job harder , not easier			0
' instead of being a no - compromise device , it often feels like a more - compromise one			0
' @entity138 : ' where are the apps ? ' ( no score ) ' it needs a bigger pile of apps and games to make up for that and , while we 're sure they 're coming , we do n't know when			0
' if gaming and music and movies and reading are what you 're looking to enjoy , then we might advise sitting this one out for a few months just to make sure that all your bases will indeed be covered			0
' if , however , you 're looking for an impeccably engineered tablet upon which you can do some serious work , a device that does n't look , feel or act like a toy , then you should get yourself a surface with @entity159 ' @entity51 : ' @entity1 has surfaced a hit ' ( 8/10 ) ' this is a great device			1
' it is a new thing , in a new space , and likely to confuse many of @entity1 ’s longtime customers			2
people will have problems with applications — especially when they encounter them online and are given an option by @entity171 to run them , only to discover this wo n’t work			0
' but overall it ’s quite good ; certainly better than any full - size @entity175 tablet on the market			2
' @entity177 : ' @entity178 , @entity179 ' ( no score ) ' what lets the @entity8 down is supposedly @entity1 ’s specialty : software			1
" @entity184 : ' @entity185 '' @entity186 is a tablet with some pluses : the major office apps and nice , optional keyboards			2
' if you can live with its tiny number of third - party apps , and somewhat disappointing battery life , it may give you the productivity some miss in other tablets			2

@entity1 tablet will cost between £ 399 and £ 559 ( $ 499 to $ 699 in the @entity11 ) when it goes on sale on thursday - the same price as an @entity3
