@entity1 team principal @entity0 has hailed @entity5 's @entity4 @entity3 victory as a ' classic ' performance			1
@entity0 and @entity1 were forced to bid farewell to @entity5 at the end of last season as the 27 - year - old decided to pursue his dream of driving for @entity12			1
despite winning four world titles and 39 grands prix with the @entity16 - based marque , @entity5 felt the time was right to try pastures new			2
@entity5 celebrates emerging victorious at the @entity4 @entity3 with @entity12 on sunday @entity1 team principal @entity0 praised @entity5 's performance , saying ' he drove brilliantly ' @entity5 celebrates taking victory in his @entity12 in the immediate aftermath of the @entity4 @entity3 on the back of his triumph at the @entity26 , it would appear to be an inspired move as @entity1 are floundering , whilst @entity12 are clearly back with a bang			1
acknowledging @entity5 's display , @entity0 said : ' on a personal note it 's great to see him win			1
i 'm pleased for him			0
he looked a happy chap			0
' i thought he drove brilliantly			0
he got his head down at the front , managed the tyres and managed to make a two - stop strategy work			0
' the @entity12 did look very gentle on its tyres in the heat and temperature ( 33 degrees centigrade )			0
' @entity42 has clearly got a good feel in the car , it has good driveability and he 's very good at looking after the tyres , and in that situation he is quite often unbeatable			2
' looking at the bigger picture , @entity0 added : ' although it was n't a great day for us , it was at least a good day for @entity51 in that in a straight race @entity12 managed to beat @entity54			1
' the start to the new season has so far been disastrous for @entity1 for after complaining vociferously about power - unit supplier @entity57 after the season - opening @entity60 @entity3 , it was brake issues that proved the team 's undoing in @entity4			1
@entity64 and @entity65 could only manage ninth and 10th respectively , even finishing behind the rookie pairing from ' sister ' team @entity67 in @entity69 and @entity70 who were seventh and eighth			2
holding up @entity12 's turnaround as an example of what can be achieved , @entity0 added : ' they have done a good job			1

@entity51 stats provided by @entity86 @entity64 was @entity1 's highest finisher in @entity4 , crossing the line in ninth position @entity0 wants his @entity1 team to use @entity12 as an example of the level of turnaround that can happen ' as soon as we started to run into traffic , temperatures started to get out of control , in particular managing the brakes , and then we did n't really have any pace			1
' it was then about trying to manage our race to make sure we got to the end , so a frustrating afternoon really			0
' we need to go away and understand some of the issues from the weekend and make sure we address them , hopefully in time for the next race in @entity106			0

@entity0 says @entity5 's @entity4 display was ' classic '
@entity1 could only take ninth and tenth in the @entity4 @entity3
