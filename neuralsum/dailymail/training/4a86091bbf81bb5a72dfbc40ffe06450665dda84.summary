by @entity1 reporter published : 12:21 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 14:15 est , 19 january 2013 explorer : @entity3 buried whisky bottles when he abandoned his desolate hut in the @entity6 to set off on an expedition three bottles of rare 19th century scotch whisky left behind by @entity6 explorer @entity3 have finally been returned to his desolate snowbound base			1
they came home today after a distiller first flew them to @entity15 to recreate the long - lost recipe			1
but not even @entity18 prime minister @entity17 , who personally returned the stash , got a taste of the contents of the bottles of @entity24 's whisky			1
they were discovered 102 years after the explorer was forced to leave them behind and buried them under floorboards ' i think we 're all tempted to crack it open and have a little drink ourselves now , ' mr @entity17 joked at a ceremony handing over the bottles to @entity37 officials at @entity18 's @entity6 base on @entity39			1
the whisky will be transferred in march from @entity39 to @entity42 's abandoned hut at @entity43 and replaced beneath it as part of a programme to protect the legacy of the heroic era of @entity6 exploration from 1898 to 1915			2
bottled in 1898 after the blend was aged 15 years , the @entity24 bottles were among three crates of @entity53 and two of brandy buried beneath a basic hut @entity3 had used during his dramatic 1907 @entity58 excursion to the @entity6			1
the expedition failed to reach the @entity60 but set a record at the time for reaching the farthest southern latitude			0
@entity42 was knighted after his return to @entity64			0
the bottles of rare 19th century whisky , pictured , were discovered 102 years after the explorer was forced to leave them behind a crate of the rare @entity24 's whisky found under the floorboards of @entity3 's hut @entity74 home : the interior of @entity3 's hut at @entity43 , where he buried the crates of whisky under the floorboards @entity80 : @entity3 's ship , the @entity82 , stuck on ice during his @entity84 of 1914 - 1918 @entity42 's stash was discovered frozen in ice by conservationists in 2010			1
the crates were frozen solid after more than a century beneath the @entity6 surface			2
gravestone : the final resting place of explorer @entity3 at @entity93 , @entity94 but the bottles were found intact — and researchers could hear the whisky sloshing around inside			1
@entity6 's minus @entity98 ( -30c ) temperature was not enough to freeze the alcohol			0
the bottles remained unopened as they were returned saturday - if @entity3 could n't have a dram , no one could - but their contents nevertheless formed the basis for a revival of the bend			1
@entity109 , which now owns the @entity24 brand , chartered a private jet to take the bottles from the @entity6 operations headquarters in the @entity18 city of @entity115 to @entity15 for analysis in 2011			2
the recipe for the whisky had been lost			2
but @entity109 recreated a limited edition of 50,000 bottles from a sample drawn with a syringe through a cork of one of the bottles			0
the conservation work of the @entity37 has received £ 5 for every bottle sold			0
the original bottles had flown in two combination - locked containers with the @entity18 prime minister to @entity6 in a @entity133 @entity132 transport plane from @entity115 on friday			0
@entity37 manager @entity134 , who was part of the team that found the whisky , recalled its pleasant aroma			0
' when you 're used to working around things in that hut that perhaps are quite decayed and some of them do n't have very nice smells , it 's very nice to work with artifacts that have such a lovely aroma , ' @entity140 told the ceremony by radio from explorer @entity152 's @entity6 hut which she is restoring			0
' and definitely the aroma of whisky was around very strongly			0
