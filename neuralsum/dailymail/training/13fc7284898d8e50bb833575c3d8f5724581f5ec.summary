@entity1 ’s connections are praying for better luck on saturday when the gelding defends his title in the @entity6			2
the eight - year - old , a six - length winner of the @entity9 marathon 12 months ago , was strongly fancied for the @entity11 but , after jumping away on terms first time in what was judged a false start , he missed the kick second time round prior to making an early error which left him detached			1
jockey @entity20 pulled up on the first circuit ensuring he is fresh and ready for a repeat bid on saturday			0
trainer @entity23 said : ‘ @entity1 is perfect and it ’s almost like he is asking us “ when am i going to race again ? ” @entity1 ( right ) ridden by @entity20 races to the finish in the 2014 @entity6 trainer @entity23 said that @entity1 is in perfect condition ahead of the @entity6 @entity1 ( left ) ploughs through the last fence and goes on to win ahead of @entity30 ( right ) ‘ @entity31 was a nightmare as he jumped away perfectly first time but never had a chance after the second start			1
‘ you never mind being beaten when you ’ve had a fair crack of the whip — that is racing — but when something like that happens it is massively frustrating			0
‘ he never saw the second fence , where he made a mistake , but perhaps it was better he did that early on in the race rather than gallop round and make the mistake four fences from home			2
at least that way we still have a fresh horse with a great chance on saturday			0
