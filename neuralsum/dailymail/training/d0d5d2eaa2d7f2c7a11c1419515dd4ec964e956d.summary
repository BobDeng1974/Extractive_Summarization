around three to seven per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity2 more children - and adults - than ever are being diagnosed with @entity1 ( @entity1 )			1
yet many of those may not have the behavioural disorder but could instead be suffering from sleep deprivation , says a leading @entity12 doctor			1
he estimates more than a third of children and a quarter of adults diagnosed with @entity1 actually have sleep problems			1
sleep deprivation , especially in children , does not - as might be expected - cause lethargy , but very similar problems to @entity1 , including hyperactivity , an inability to focus , aggression and forgetfulness			1
the similarity between the symptoms , coupled with many doctors ' poor understanding of sleep disorders , is what is causing the confusion in some patients , says @entity32 , a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the @entity34			0
' while there is no doubt that many people have @entity1 , a substantial proportion of cases are really sleep disorders in disguise , ' he says			1
@entity1 is characterised by problems with attention , concentration and impulsiveness			2
around 5 per cent of @entity2 children are thought to be affected , with prescriptions for drugs to treat them rising by 70 per cent between 2005 and 2011			0
prescriptions for @entity49 , the most popular drug for @entity1 , have quadrupled in the past decade , with children as young as three taking the powerful medication			1
@entity1 is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of three and seven and is four times more common in boys than girls			1
in around half of cases , the disorder continues into adult life			0
but now some experts are questioning whether the real problem is poor quality sleep			1
numerous studies have shown that many children with @entity1 also have breathing problems during sleep such as snoring and apnoea - where breathing becomes slow or interrupted by the muscles and soft tissue in the throat collapsing , causing a blockage - and are more likely to have disrupted delta sleep			1
this is the deep , rejuvenating kind which starts about 30 to 50 minutes after we fall asleep			0
children need delta sleep for proper growth and development			2
one study , published in 2004 in the journal @entity85 , looked at 34 children with @entity1			1
every one showed a deficit of delta sleep , compared with only a handful of the 32 children in the study who did n't have the disorder			2
meanwhile , a study of more than 11,000 @entity2 children published last year found those who suffered breathing problems during sleep in infancy were more likely to have behavioural difficulties later in life			2
no ' off ' button : the distraction of 24 - hour tv , computer games and mobile phones is a major factor in child sleep deprivation these children were 20 to 60 per cent more likely to have behavioural problems at the age of four , and 40 to 100 per cent more likely to have such problems at seven			1
tellingly , when sleep problems are resolved , the behavioural problems attributed to @entity1 can disappear			1
a study published in the journal @entity116 in 2006 found that removing tonsils to improve sleep seems to banish adhd symptoms			2
a year after the surgery , half of the children who had previously been diagnosed with @entity1 no longer had it			1
professor @entity32 's theory is supported by @entity2 sleep experts , who say it is no coincidence that the rise in @entity1 diagnoses in the @entity129 came at a time when people were getting less sleep			1
the latest figures suggest that the number of adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night has risen from 2 per cent in 1960 to more than 35 per cent in 2011			0
according to dr @entity137 , a @entity2 sleep expert , children today get at least an hour less sleep than they did 100 years ago			2
many ten - year - olds do not get the recommended ten hours a night			0
the distraction of 24 - hour tv , computer games and mobile phones is a major factor because they not only stimulate the mind but suppress levels of melatonin , a hormone that helps to regulate sleeping and waking cycles			0
the light - sensitive cells at the back of the eye are more sensitive to the light emitted by screens - which tricks the body into thinking that it 's still daytime , so it disrupts the production of melatonin			0
' ask any parent to describe a sleep - deprived child and the characteristics are not dissimilar to @entity1 , ' he says			2
' some children do have adhd , but others are sleep - deprived and we are calling it @entity1			1
' some perfectly normal children who , for whatever reason , are chronically sleep - deprived , are being diagnosed with adhd by their gps			1
many doctors also have very little knowledge of sleep disorders			0
' slee - pea children : ' some perfectly normal children who , for whatever reason , are chronically sleep - deprived , are being diagnosed with @entity1 ' more controversial is his belief that it may also be easier for doctors to tell parents their child has a medical condition rather than that he or she needs more sleep , with the parenting implications that involves			1
' for some children it may be a diagnosis of convenience			0
yet by misdiagnosing sleep - deprived patients as having @entity1 , we are not only doing a disservice to those who really have adhd but may be treating thousands of patients with poor sleep with medications designed to control or modify daytime behaviour			1
' furthermore , drugs for treating @entity1 can have side - effects , including poor appetite , stomach pain and , in rare cases , heart problems , chest pain , liver problems and suicidal thoughts			2
professor @entity32 's interest in the link between adhd and sleep disorders was prompted by his own experience after being diagnosed with @entity1 as an adult			1
for nearly a decade he suffered from profound cognitive lethargy and difficulty focusing - he needed a daily nap and spent much of the weekend sleeping			0
initially he was told that the problems were the result of psychological issues			0
then , in 2005 , he was diagnosed with @entity1			2
not convinced , he underwent a sleep study which showed , at the age of 33 , that he had an unusual form of narcolepsy , a neurological disorder which usually causes intermittent , uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep			0
' i 'd never fallen asleep while eating or talking , but it turned out that just 5 per cent of my sleep was delta sleep			0
with the proper treatment my cognitive problems came to an end			0
my daytime focus is remarkably improved			0
' professor @entity32 says there is more going on in our nocturnal lives than we realised			0
' however , it is impossible to know how well you sleep unless you undergo tests - that 's because sleep is partly biological and partly behavioural , ' he says			0
' even if parents and children do all the right things to make sure they get enough sleep , they may be getting too little quality sleep			1
' limiting time on devices , especially in the evenings , is a good first step for children with these types of symptoms			0
' if that does n't work , parents should ensure that their child gets enough sleep for their age ( ten to 11 hours for school - age children , seven to eight for adults )			2
if that does not help , seek medical help and consider undergoing a sleep study .			0

sleep deprivation in children causes similar effects as adhd
some experts think kids diagnosed with @entity1 really suffer from *bad* sleep
children get much less and poorer quality sleep now than they used to
