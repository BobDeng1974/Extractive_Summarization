by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 11:45 est , 7 september 2012 a medieval silver penny found at the site gives further hints that the lost body of @entity5 may soon be found archaeologists from the @entity7 , who are leading the search for the lost grave of @entity5 , have announced that they have made a new advance in their quest			1
they have uncovered evidence of the lost garden of @entity15 - where , historically , it is recorded there was a memorial to @entity5 now the ‘ time tomb team ’ , as they have become to be known , has discovered paving stones which they believe belong to the garden			1
the @entity7 is leading the archaeological search for the burial place of @entity5 with @entity26 , in association with the @entity28			1
in 1485 @entity5 was defeated at the battle of @entity30			1
his body , stripped and despoiled , was brought to @entity26 where he was buried in the church of the @entity33 , known as the @entity34			0
over time the exact whereabouts of the @entity34 became lost			0
he project , which began two weeks ago , has involved digging of two trenches at a council park - and this week a third trench was excavated			0
earlier this week , the archaeologists confirmed they had found the church of the @entity34 and now they have found the garden outside the church			1
@entity45 , of the @entity28 , said : ' this is an astonishing discovery and a huge step forward in the search for @entity5 's grave			1
' @entity15 is incredibly important in the story of @entity5 's grave , and in potentially helping us get that little bit closer to locating it			1
' a stone frieze , which the university believes may be from the @entity58 stall closer and closer : fragments of what could be the east end window of the church in the early 1600s , @entity63 @entity15 , a mayor of @entity26 , bought the land of the @entity34 and built a large mansion house with a garden on the site			1
in 1612 , @entity68 , father of the famous architect , was visiting @entity15 and recorded seeing a handsome three foot stone pillar in @entity15 's garden			2
inscribed on the pillar was : ' here lies the body of @entity5 sometime @entity74 '			1
this is the last known record of the site of @entity5 's grave			1
@entity5 is historically recorded as being buried in the choir of the @entity79			1
a lead window came ( a section of leading that supports stained glass windows from the @entity34 church the earliest surviving portrait of @entity5 in @entity86			1
archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in @entity26			2
the 69p stamp featuring @entity5 born in 1452 , @entity5 was @entity74 of @entity91 for two years , from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the @entity30			1
according to another tale , @entity5 consulted a seer in @entity26 before the battle who foretold that ' where your spur should strike on the ride into battle , your head shall be broken on the return '			2
on the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the @entity106 ; legend has it that , as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse , his head struck the same stone and was broken @entity114 was the last @entity91 king to be killed in battle he was the last king of the @entity117 and the last of the @entity120 dynasty			0
although @entity5 has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a hunchback and a withered arm , most historians now claim such an image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by @entity127			2
thereafter , in 1711 , @entity15 's descendants sold the mansion house and garden			2
after passing through various owners the mansion house was eventually pulled down sometime in the 1870s and the municipal buildings were built			0
however , @entity15 's garden seems to have remained a garden , or wasteland , up until the 1930s - 40s when it was tarmacked over to become a car park			0
mrs @entity45 added : “ the discovery of @entity15 's garden is a major step forward and i 'm incredibly excited			0
' in locating what looks like one of the garden 's pathways and , potentially , its central area which could have once held the three foot stone pillar marking the location of @entity5 's grave , we could be that bit closer to finding the resting place of @entity155 's last warrior king			1
” mr @entity156 , co-director of @entity157 , said the area of paving was found at its southern end , composed of re-used medieval tiles laid in a haphazard pattern			0
“ the tiles were also extremely worn and of many different sizes			0
' although the date at which the paving was laid has yet to be confirmed , we suspect that it relates to the period of @entity15 ’s mansion			0
' interestingly , the 18th century map of @entity26 shows a formal garden with a series of paths leading to a central point			0
“ the paving we have found may relate to this garden , but it lies outside the church to the south			0
' inside the church in this third trench , further investigation has revealed some large fragments of window tracery which could well relate to the east window , behind the high altar			2
if so , this may show that we are in the extreme east end of the building – near the choir where @entity5 is said to have been buried			2
“ having overcome the major hurdle of finding the church , i am now confident that we are within touching distance of finding the choir – a real turning point in the project and a stage which , at the outset , i never really thought we might reach			0
” work at the site will stop for a public open day between 11 - 2 on saturday september 8 and will resume next week			0
the dig is being filmed by @entity201 for a forthcoming @entity203 documentary to be aired later this year			0
a depiction of the carnage during the @entity30 by 18th century painter @entity206 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity30 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity208 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity117 and @entity211			0
one of the most important clashes in @entity91 history , it saw the death of @entity5 , ushered in the @entity217 dynasty and gave @entity127 one of his best known quotations			2
the leading role has been played by @entity221 and sir @entity222 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity117 king @entity5 and his challenger @entity217 , @entity229 and @entity230			2
the seeds of @entity5 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity234 in 1483			1
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity234 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity5 was involved in the death of his wife			1
@entity217 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity203			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity91 from his base in @entity244 , @entity217 arrived on the coast of @entity246 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity5 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity217 's army south of @entity250 in @entity251			1
after @entity5 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity217 and became the first @entity91 monarch of the @entity217 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			1

team say dig is ' exceeding *expectations* ' , and now plan to look for the monarch 's burial site
archaeologists have identified the *franciscan* friary known as @entity267 from window and tile fragments
if remains are found , they will undergo *dna* *analysis* at the @entity7 to confirm that they are those of @entity5
