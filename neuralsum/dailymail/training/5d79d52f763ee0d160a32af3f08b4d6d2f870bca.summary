’ the chancellor branded mr @entity4 ’s speech ‘ a turkey ’ and mercilessly ribbed him over his decision to cancel a grade three piano exam because it clashed with the @entity58			1

one labour mp went further , saying : ‘ he f * * * * * it up			1
i was watching it thinking “ we are f * * * * * ”			1
‘ he ’s supposed to be a bright bloke , but there was no analysis of the @entity58 in what he said			1

another @entity33 insider said mr @entity4 would keep his job but should change course			2

‘ but what is concerning people is not just the performance			2

it ’s probably too late to move him now but today was a reality check			1
’ one @entity119 said @entity5 were likely to demand a rethink of @entity33 ’s economic policies in the coming days			2
‘ i ’ll be amazed if you do n’t see the @entity33 elements start to say that we need something more than cost of living issues			2
’ mr @entity4 tried to put a brave face on his performance			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve got a bit of a sore throat			0
it was very , very loud			0
