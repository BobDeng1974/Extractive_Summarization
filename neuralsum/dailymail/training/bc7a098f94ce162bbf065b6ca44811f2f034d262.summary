what better way to prepare for a @entity2 title defence than sparring with a boxing legend ? well @entity2 light heavyweight champion @entity4 has done just that , posting a video on @entity7 with former heavyweight boxing champion @entity8			1
luckily for @entity4 the quick box was n’t in the ring as @entity8 , an avid mixed martial arts fan , still showed he ’s still pretty good with his hands			0
@entity4 , 23 , became the youngest champion in @entity2 history in 2011 and recently underwent surgery to repair his knee , which forced a planned title defence against @entity40 back to january 2015			1
during his rehab @entity4 has also been seen dabbling in the world of @entity44 wrestling but will look to prepare in time for his much anticipated seventh title defence against @entity40			0
the pair brawled in @entity47 at the beginning of the month and will certainly be a bout to watch out for in january			0
champion : @entity4 became @entity2 's youngest ever champion in 2011 with the light heavyweight title title defence : @entity4 will defend his title against @entity40 in january next year after knee surgery @entity56 and @entity40 speak following media day incident			2
