freedom of movement : @entity1 has agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the @entity4 it is a controversial and flagrant display of discrimination that has plagued one of @entity9 ’s most august institutions for decades			1
but now the 208 - year - old @entity1 has caved in to public pressure – and finally agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the @entity4			1
officials had previously been accused of taking a snobbish attitude to the ornaments , which many deride as ‘ tacky ’			0
but this year , on the 100th anniversary of the show , gnomes are not only to be allowed into the grounds – but will be positively celebrated			1
celebrities will be invited to decorate the diminutive gentlemen ... and a parade of 150 of them will be lined up for official inspection by the @entity25			1
the u-turn marks a victory for green - fingered rebels who had taken to smuggling gnomes into their displays at the prestigious event			2
@entity1 director - general @entity32 admitted ‘ there were a few raised eyebrows ’ when the rules were overturned last month , explaining : ‘ we are a learned society and a purveyor of excellence in horticulture			1
’ but she said that the society ’s 17 - member ruling council was unanimous in voting through the change , adding : ‘ it is important for people to realise we have got a sense of humour and we do n’t take ourselves too seriously			1
there was not one gnomophobe on the council			2
’ previous years have seen placard - bearing protesters at the gates of the flower show , demanding ‘ equal rights for gnomes ’			1
the most high - profile dissident was @entity59 , a 13 - time @entity4 gold medallist who was rebuked for sneaking her 8in lucky mascot , @entity61 , into her display in 2009 , defying the ban on ‘ brightly coloured creatures ’			2
once unloved : @entity66 protestors outside the @entity67 after being denied access to the 2005 @entity4 on hearing the rule had been overturned , a delighted mrs @entity59 said : ‘ it ’s great news			2
i am so excited i ’m going to give @entity61 a new jacket			0
it ’s beige at the moment but it ’s going to be bright green with pink spots			0
there ’s no need for camouflage any more			0
‘ it really shows how far the @entity1 has evolved			1
when @entity82 was spotted in my garden , it caused a real stir and i was met with a lot of stony silences from colleagues			0
but it really is harmless fun			0
at last the @entity1 has grown up and recognised that garden gnomes are for all			1
’ @entity91 , who owns 2,000 gnomes at her @entity93 in @entity94 , added : ‘ it ’s about time @entity4 allowed them			2
i ’ve seen plastic windmills at @entity4 , so why not gnomes ? they ’re much nicer			0
some people are so snobbish about gnomes			0
’ @entity1 officials were previously branded ‘ stuffy old gits ’ for the ban			1
the official explanation was that the ornaments might distract from the horticultural displays – although the suspicion was always that they were considered too tacky			0
@entity66 celebration : on the @entity4 's 100th anniversary of the show gnomes will be positively celebrated however , gnomes were not always held in such low regard			1
when first introduced to @entity9 they were expensive collectors ’ items			0
they are believed to have been brought to @entity9 in 1867 , when gardener sir @entity116 brought 21 earthenware figurines from @entity118 for the grounds of @entity120 in @entity121			0
sir @entity116 was a spiritualist who believed they had protective powers			0
but gnomes lost their cachet when they were made from plastic			0
although the @entity1 has relaxed its ‘ no gnomes ’ rule for this year ’s flower show – which runs from may 21 to 25 – other items will remain on its prohibited list , including fairies and pixies , balloons and flags			1
stars decorating gnomes at the show include @entity141 writer @entity140			2
they will be sold in aid of the @entity1 campaign to install more gardens in schools .			2
