since giving birth to her daughter @entity2 four months ago , @entity0 has become the victim of cruel taunts about her size 12 post-pregnancy body			1
but the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down			1
speaking to fabulous magazine , the 28 - year - old former x factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight , and questions about when she 'll ' drop the post-baby pounds ' , have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself			2
' @entity0 , who has never named the father of @entity2 publicly , also has two other children called @entity46 , aged 10 , and @entity47 , nine , with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart @entity49 , 29			1
and the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids			0
describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years , the @entity55 singer said , ' when i look back , i think i should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny			2
' i 'm curvy , i 've got thighs , but i 'm not big			0
i eat healthily and i 'm breastfeeding , so i know the weight will come off naturally			0
' @entity0 pictured with her two older children @entity46 , ( left ) and @entity47 , nine , ( right ) currently promoting her new album @entity64 , it would be easy for @entity0 to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews			2
but while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth , @entity0 says she 's not feeling that pressure this time around			1
instead , she 's standing up for new mums everywhere , by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight			0
the former @entity79 contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics , but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined ( pictured left : in concert at the @entity86 , @entity87 , last month , and right : on this morning last week ) she said : ' women 's bodies are amazing , what our bodies can do is incredible so it 's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny , be this , be that , they 're all distractions			1
' they rob us of what we should be focusing on and that 's sad			0
' though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics , she has revealed that they 're a lot closer home than she ever imagined			0
' i just want to enjoy @entity2 , ' said @entity0 , who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible ( @entity0 pictured with her newborn ) @entity0 also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview , when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with @entity2			1
she revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again , she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum			0
the star has n't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner @entity47 pops by regularly to help look after the children			0
and while @entity0 admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together , and she is open to the idea , she is enjoying being on her own for the time being			2
@entity0 flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the @entity128 last month and says she 's proud of her womanly shape			1

critics have made cruel taunts about @entity0 's post-baby body
but singer is refusing to *bow* to pressure to ' snap back into shape '
she wants to enjoy being a new mother to four - month - old @entity2 instead
