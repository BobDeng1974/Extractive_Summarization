this was the white wedding to end all white weddings , with even the guests being asked to become matching accessories to the bride			1
but that dress code was about as modest as @entity8 ’s raunchy , bacchanalian wedding feast was to be			1
but then with a £ 2.5 billion fortune , courtesy of her @entity12 supremo father @entity11 , her marriage to disgraced @entity17 stockbroker @entity15 was always going to be a little less than discreet			0
just married : @entity8 and @entity15 down rose champagne on a boat on the @entity20 on wednesday introducing mr and mrs @entity22 ! @entity15 and new bride @entity8 were seen celebrating their marriage at a beach party on wednesday following their tuesday nuptials a stumble here and there : @entity8 looks a little unsteady on her feet as the couple head down to the shore that , of course , is not her style			1
@entity8 subscribes to the ‘ if you ’ve got it , flaunt it ’ philosophy , and she decided to mark the occasion with all the flamboyance money can buy			1
the trouble is , of course , that you ca n’t buy taste			0
yesterday , the famous @entity46 , once a byword for @entity49 glamour , was surrendering to @entity8 ’s new - money crowd			1
from the bridegroom pulling on a large cigar to the muscled , tattooed guests and superannuated models , it was excess all areas			2
the pictures barely do justice to the extraordinary scenes of yesterday ’s beach party , which followed the sumptuous wedding of the previous night			1
it - girl @entity62 , a former fancy of prince @entity64 , who was among the guests , tweeted : ‘ still partying , @entity67 style			2
’ there was plenty of laughter , of course , but perhaps the biggest smile came when the groom , who appeared to be wearing a platinum band on his finger to match @entity8 ’s wedding ring , declared of his new wife : ‘ i admire her enormously			1
she does not show her wealth			0
it ’s not what attracted me to her			0
’ yet from the moment the two had touched down in the @entity86 , where one @entity87 was waiting to whisk them away , and another to take their luggage , money was at the heart of the celebration			0
on tuesday , @entity8 , 28 , was sheathed in a couture @entity94 gown complete with 30 ft train and crystals on the bodice			1
and she took her first dance as mrs @entity22 to a cover of @entity101 ’s @entity100 , performed live by @entity102 — hired for £ 2.5 million			0
miss @entity102 also sang her new single beautiful			0
sir @entity104 also played an hour - long set on monday night , dedicating his song @entity106 , from the soundtrack to @entity110 film @entity111 , to the happy couple			1
it is thought the singer was paid £ 1 million to attend			0
some guests claimed that @entity8 had been irritated over absent guests of honour @entity117 and @entity119 and their mother , @entity121 , @entity122 — who failed to turn up			1
a source said : ‘ @entity8 was livid that @entity122 and her girls did not attend			2
for her fairytale wedding she wanted royalty to attend			0
’ but yesterday the bride was on the beach and turning up the volume			0
cheeky ! @entity15 gives his new wife an affectionate bottom pinch strict dress code : it looked like everyone had adhered to the white theme although it was undeniably lavish , exceeding its £ 5 million budget ( the hotel rooms alone cost £ 600,000 and some observers put the total cost at around £ 7 million ) , some complained the three - day event failed to live up to expectations			1
some suggested that mr @entity15 ’s guests behaved like ‘ chavs ’ , jostling at the free bar , exposing their behinds and being sick after drinking too much alcohol			1
former financier mr @entity15 , 31 , was banned for insider trading last year			0
the @entity152 reduced his fine from £ 160,000 to £ 30,000 due to his ‘ financial circumstances ’ and a ‘ debilitating illness ’			0
he proposed within a month of meeting miss @entity8 in january this year			2
in a 15 - minute speech after the wedding ceremony , he explained how they fell in love , and praised her charity work , adding : ‘ she owes her character to both her very remarkable parents			2
’ miss @entity8 helps fundraise for @entity164 in @entity165 — by auctioning off her old clothes			2
your carriage awaits : after grabbing a towel , @entity8 joins her husband on the boat you may kiss the bride : @entity8 and @entity15 struggled to keep their hands off each other during the party mr @entity15 joked about his bride ’s notorious shopping habits			1
in the same evening , she wore three couture gowns — the @entity94 dress , another long , white gown believed to be designed by @entity182 , and a short sequinned ‘ flapper ’ dress , thought to be by @entity185 , for the dancing — but he denied she was ‘ shallow ’ , saying : ‘ @entity8 is the most caring and sensitive person i know by a mile			1
' she is incredibly faithful and loyal , and is an incredible sister , daughter and friend			0
i love you with all my heart			0
’ mr @entity15 has reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement , meaning he will not take any of miss @entity8 ’s wealth if they divorce			2
but as her husband , he is now free to enjoy her opulent lifestyle to the full			0
miss @entity8 ’s sister @entity199 , 24 , who also gave a speech , and her 55 - year - old mother @entity201 — who is divorced from @entity11 — arrived on sunday to help with preparations			1
loving the party : @entity8 certainly seems like she is enjoying her time celebrating her big day mr @entity15 ’s friends from @entity67 mingled with miss @entity8 ’s celebrity guests , who included model and tv presenter @entity208 , former it - girl @entity209 , @entity214 singer @entity213 , actor @entity211 and his girlfriend , model @entity209			1
by day , the younger guests partied next to the @entity217 ’s 50 m infinity pool			0
the women had white dresses , the men white shorts and bare chests			0
as the guests sipped on strawberry daiquiris and snacked on squid and oysters , nearby ramblers were heard complaining that the blaring music had disrupted the peaceful setting			0
yesterday , the wedding party dressed in white for a relaxed barbecue on @entity232 , a mile away from the hotel			1
however , some guests complained the event did not quite match up to the grandeur expected of the @entity237 , one of the most exclusive stretches of the @entity20			1
one said : ‘ it felt like a free - for - all			2
it was all very informal and relaxed , and guests were left to go up and get their own drinks			2
‘ it was almost too informal			0
there were around 150 guests in total and around 40 to 50 were @entity15 ’s friends			1
‘ it was very chavvy			0
during the three - day event , some of them were mooning — and one was seen throwing up after over-indulging			0
a lot of @entity8 ’s friends thought there might be eligible bachelors they could meet , but many could n’t wait to leave the party			1
’ one figure remained above it all — @entity8 ’s billionaire father @entity11			2
despite reports to the contrary , the wedding was not funded by the deep pockets of mr @entity15 ’s new father - in - law , 82 - year - old mr @entity266 , who arrived late after attending the @entity267			2
‘ he ’s not paying a penny towards it , ’ says a close friend			0
‘ @entity8 has paid for it all herself			1
