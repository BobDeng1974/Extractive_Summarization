by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 05:30 est , 13 july 2012 the security firm @entity1 was reportedly paid a staggering £ 284million to provide up to 17,500 personnel for the @entity3			1
but yesterday , in a major humiliation for company bosses and @entity8 organisers , it admitted it would fall well short of the target , forcing ministers to pull in thousands of military personnel			2
the company was contracted to provide a minimum of 15,400 security staff , with a target of 17,500			2
a soldier on duty at the olympic park in @entity19 on thursday			0
he 'll soon be joined by 3,500 other troops yesterday , as the government confirmed the call - up of 3,500 extra troops , @entity1 claimed it would be able to bring in 13,800			1
however , with 14 days to go to the @entity3 , question marks remained whether it would meet even that target , as just a small fraction of that total is available for deployment			1
only 4,000 are ‘ boots on the ground ’ , working as ticket checkers and bag searchers at the @entity33 in @entity19 , east @entity34			0
another 9,000 are still in the training and vetting process – raising fears even the more reduced target might not be achievable			1
the armed forces now make up the overwhelming majority of the security staff likely to be deployed during the @entity3			1
the original plan for 7,500 military is bolstered by a special contingent of 5,000 , plus the 3,500 announced on tuesday , making a total of 16,000			0
in addition , there will be 3,000 unpaid volunteers			0
the number of staff needed to guard the @entity8 venues more than doubled last december after the organising committee @entity54 wildly underestimated the total required			0
originally @entity54 contracted @entity1 to provide 2,000 security guards , but in december the firm agreed to increase that number massively			1
falling short : the @entity41 are to provide up to 3,500 extra troops for security duty at the @entity3 after private security firm @entity1 admitted it could not supply the 10,000 guards it promised to deliver yesterday @entity62 insisted there would be financial penalties for the firm for failing to meet the contract			1
but @entity54 refused to comment on the nature of any fines , claiming it would breach commercial confidentiality			0
that is despite taxpayers coughing up at least £ 9billion for the cost of the @entity3			1
insiders said the company had repeatedly claimed until last week that it would meet its obligations			2
a @entity77 source accused the firm of ‘ abysmal ’ failure and said it had delayed completing training and vetting processes to save money by not having too many staff on the books before the start of the @entity3			1
the source said : ‘ until yesterday officials from @entity1 were turning up and assuring us that the figures were getting better and going to be ok			2
‘ then we learn there ’s not as many as we need			0
they did n’t want to be throwing money at the problem six months ago because their staff would be sitting around doing nothing			0
’ home secretary @entity96 was hauled to the @entity97 to try to explain the shortfall			2
she insisted : ‘ there is no question of @entity8 security being compromised			2
’ but @entity103 mp @entity102 , who called for the emergency statement , said : ‘ @entity1 has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops			1
’ but @entity103 mp @entity102 , said : ¿ @entity1 has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops			1
¿ mr @entity102 , chairman of the @entity109 , has written to @entity110 , chief executive of @entity1 , demanding he give evidence before @entity112 next week			1
the debacle is the latest blow to the reputation of @entity116 , while relatively unknown to the public , is one of the world ’s biggest security companies			0
in recent years its tentacles have extended into swathes of @entity125 life which used to be the preserve of the public sector , including running prisons and police custody suites			0
from headquarters in @entity131 , @entity132 , company bosses run a sprawling multinational company with interests in more than 125 countries			0
they provide security at @entity137 and other major airports , and for vans transporting cash on behalf of banks and other financial institutions			0
under its previous name @entity144 it had a contract for transporting prisoners , but in 2004 the company ‘ lost ’ two prisoners , sparking a major investigation			0
it runs six jails in the @entity125 including @entity152 , where an inspection report in october 2011 said drugs were regularly being thrown over the prison walls			0
three @entity1 guards are on police bail over the death in october 2010 of @entity160 national @entity159 , who was restrained while being deported from the country			1
in november last year , company bosses pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion - pound takeover of @entity165 , a @entity167 catering and cleaning firm , after a shareholder revolt			2
only yesterday , the company ’s failure over the @entity8 was cited as @entity173 police pulled out of a huge privatisation deal for which @entity1 was in the running			2
a spokesman for @entity1 said : ‘ this is an unprecedented and very complex security recruitment and deployment exercise which is being carried out to a very tight schedule			1
‘ we have encountered some delays in progressing applicants through the final stages but we are working extremely hard to process these as swiftly as possible			0
