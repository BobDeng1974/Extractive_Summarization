@entity1 's hopes of becoming president of @entity3 suffered a huge blow tonight as her @entity5 was beaten into joint second place in regional elections			1
the far - right party was predicted to make massive gains , but early exit polls put @entity13 's conservatives out in front			1
it is a huge boost for the 60 - year - old former president who - despite facing a string of corruption charges - is convinced he can become head of state again in 2017			0
the figures made a mockery of ms @entity48 's claims that her fiercely anti-immigration and @entity50 party could mount a serious challenge for power			1
' we 'll get stuck into the regions and then we 're off to invade the @entity56 , ' the 46 - year - old had said before the vote			2
at stake were 101 departments - or administrative regions - and 4,100 regional government seats			0
ms @entity48 was certain that she could do better than the opposition conservatives and the ruling socialists , who are performing appallingly because of the hapless government of president @entity65			2
ms @entity48 had positioned the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) away from its overtly racist and anti-semitic roots , and won 25 per cent of the vote at local and @entity69 elections last year			1
@entity13 immediately ruled out any alliances between his party and @entity5 candidates in next sunday 's second round			1
' to those who voted @entity5 , we understand your frustrations , ' the @entity41 chairman told supporters at party headquarters			0
' but this party will not solve @entity3 's problems - it will only make them worse , ' added the ex-president , who came out of retirement last year and hopes to secure the 2017 presidential ticket for his bitterly divided party in primaries next year			2
@entity89 , the @entity90 prime minister , has also attacked the @entity5 , claiming it is a huge danger to @entity3			2
conservative leader @entity13 delivers a speech after his party came first in the local body elections ' i fear for my country , i fear it will split apart when confronted with the @entity5			1
its policies would be a disaster for the country , ' said mr @entity89			0
' do you think a @entity5 scoring twenty five per cent in @entity69 elections , perhaps thirty per cent in local elections , and so on , can not win the presidential election ? ' he asked			1
while the vote means she can no longer argue the @entity5 is @entity3 's most popular party , @entity108 said the result was still a gain for a party almost totally absent from the departements at present , and a slap for @entity65 's prime minister @entity89			1
' @entity89 must now hear the message of voters and have the decency to hand in his resignation to the president , ' she told supporters of the centrist reformer , who @entity65 already said will remain in post whatever the final vote outcome			0
although ms @entity48 was always unlikely to become president in 2017 , it was thought she could come runner up , as her father @entity127 did in 2002			0
@entity129 's limited victory sent shockwaves round the world , even though he eventually lost to @entity132			0
@entity3 president @entity65 casts his vote in the elections for local councils across @entity3 @entity65 today acknowledged that the key issues of the elections would be abstention ' and the score of the @entity5 ' today , @entity5 candidates were fielded in 1,909 out of a total of 2,054 constituencies for the first round of voting			1
the second round is next sunday			0
for the first time , candidates appeared on ballots in pairs - one male , one female - to ensure that 50 percent of council members will be women			0
those that voted today was estimated at just under 43 per cent of all those eligible - a figure which is up almost six points from the cantonal elections of 2011			0
the green vote also seemed to have collapsed in today 's poll , with the environmentalists receiving just two per cent of the national poll , according to the @entity38 poll			1
mr @entity13 had a single term as president , between 2007 and 2012 , but was defeated by mr @entity65 's @entity165			1
within a week of mr @entity13 leaving office , the @entity167 home he shared with his third wife , the former supermodel @entity168 , was raided by anti-corruption officers			0
mr @entity13 denies any wrongdoing , but is still facing a number of enquiries , including one into allegations that he received millions in illegal cash from the late colonel @entity176			0
prime minister @entity89 emerges from a voting booth after casting his vote in the first round of the @entity3 departmental elections			2

@entity13 's conservatives made gains in today 's @entity3 local elections
@entity5 leader @entity1 claim to ' invade the @entity56 ' in tatters
exit polls show her anti-eu party came second with 23.5 percent of vote
@entity65 's *deeply* *unpopular* socialists came joint second on same figures
the elections will determine *political* makeup of 2,000 local councils
