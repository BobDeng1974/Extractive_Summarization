the political truce that helped save the @entity1 collapsed last night as @entity2 promised ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ’ once @entity3 is handed new powers			1
the prime minister sought to seize the initiative after winning the biggest gamble of his premiership , the @entity3 independence referendum			1
his promise to ban @entity3 @entity14 from voting on @entity6 - only issues at @entity16 is also an attempt to head off a @entity19 revolt over extravagant promises of more powers for the @entity22 in the event of a no vote			1
’ but his plan , requiring draft laws to be put before @entity22 by january , was opposed by @entity38 , which condemned it as ‘ a back of a fag packet solution ’			1
there was also a growing revolt in @entity19 circles over a separate , last - ditch funding ‘ bribe ’ to the @entity3 made by the prime minister			1
@entity48 , tipped as mr @entity2 ’s successor , accused him of a ‘ slightly reckless promise ’ to keep the generous public spending formula for @entity3 that dates back to 1979			1
rattled by a nationalist surge in the opinion polls , the @entity53 parties have put forward a timetable for change : yesterday @entity58 called for a ‘ constitutional convention ’ at the end of 2015 involving mps , councillors and voters in each region , as former deputy prime minister @entity65 attempted to revive his vision of regional assemblies			0
mr @entity2 ’s move , including a pledge to consider devolving powers to major @entity6 cities , leaves @entity38 opposing the same rights for @entity35 that it promised to @entity3			1
the party will be permanently weakened if its 40 @entity3 mps are stripped of the right to vote on issues controlled by the @entity22 , which will include tax , welfare , health and education			1
@entity3 mps would be excluded from voting in the rest of the country ’s key decisions and @entity3 and @entity35 could end up with different income tax rates			1
there are doubts over whether an mp representing a @entity3 seat could be prime minister or chancellor , as they would have no say over laws their government proposed			1
a @entity38 government with anything other than a landslide majority would also struggle to get measures such as mr @entity58 ’s proposed new 50p top rate of tax through @entity22			2
shadow chancellor @entity100 is said to have warned colleagues @entity38 ’s ability to pass a @entity103 is at risk if plans for fast - track devolution of more powers are implemented			2
mr @entity2 ’s move to seize the mantle of @entity6 nationalism was also designed to spike @entity112 ’s guns			2
leader @entity113 had been preparing to make the cause of @entity6 nationalism his latest battle cry			0
the prime minister insisted : ‘ the question of @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws , the so - called @entity120 question , requires a decisive answer so just as @entity3 will vote separately on their issues of tax , spending and welfare , so too @entity35 as well as @entity127 and @entity128 should be able to vote on these issues			1
home rule : the prime minister said @entity3 mps should be banned from voting on @entity6 - only issues ‘ all this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace as the settlement for @entity3			1
’ the prime minister will , however , reject calls from some @entity138 for a new @entity6 @entity22 and @entity38 ’s suggestion for new swathes of regional government			2
instead , the voting rights of @entity3 mps will be curtailed – though exactly how is to be hammered out by a cabinet committee headed by commons leader @entity144			1
clauses are expected to be added to a draft @entity147 on devolution to @entity3 to be unveiled in november and introduced in january			2
@entity149 suggested they will support some form of ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity14 ’ at @entity16 , as long as power is also devolved to the @entity154 ’s big cities			0
sir @entity155 , former @entity149 leader , said that although he was a @entity3 mp it would be unfair if he was able to continue voting on matters ceded to the @entity22 which no longer affect his constituents			2
however , there are doubts over the proposed breakneck pace of reform , given that the future of @entity3 mps at @entity16 once power is devolved – the @entity120 question – has been posed but unanswered for decades			1
in the closing days of the referendum campaign , mr @entity2 , mr @entity58 and @entity167 signed up to a ‘ vow ’ drawn up by former prime minister @entity170 , including the ‘ continuation ’ of the @entity173 formula			2
@entity31 sources said the funding agreement – devised by @entity173 in 1979 to adjust block grants to @entity3 , @entity127 and @entity128 – would become increasingly redundant as more responsibility for tax is given to the @entity22			2
on tuesday , in their desperation to secure a no vote , @entity2 , @entity58 and @entity167 made a ‘ vow ’ of greater powers for @entity3 in a letter to the @entity183 newspaper ( right )			1
they wrote : ‘ the @entity22 is permanent and extensive new powers for the @entity22 will be delivered by the process and to the timetable agreed and announced by our three parties , starting on 19th september			0
’ a timetable has been agreed – but not which powers will be handed over			0
the three parties have each put forward ideas			0
@entity38 would put @entity3 in control of 40 per cent of cash it raises			1
@entity200 could vary income tax rates by up to 15p			0
the @entity19 want to devolve all control of income tax			0
@entity3 ’s @entity22 would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget			2
the @entity149 would hand over inheritance tax , income tax and capital gains tax			0
@entity3 would control 60 per cent of its total revenue			2
the vow goes on to say that , whatever the new powers : ‘ we can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the @entity213 will be a matter for the @entity22			0
’ it says the @entity173 formula will still be used to divide tax revenue between @entity35 , @entity3 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
under this formula , @entity3 gets more money per head than @entity6 regions			2
@entity48 leads the @entity19 rebellion against @entity3 ' bribe ' @entity48 last night put himself at the head of a growing @entity19 mutiny over @entity2 ’s funding ‘ bribe ’ to @entity3			1
the @entity228 mayor , a contender to succeed mr @entity2 , said the prime minister had made a ‘ slightly reckless promise ’ to maintain the @entity173 formula – the arrangement drawn up by a @entity38 peer in 1979 that ensures generous funding for @entity3			1
the @entity228 mayor said the prime minister had made a ‘ reckless promise ’ to maintain the @entity173 formula in the closing days of the referendum campaign , mr @entity2 , @entity58 and @entity167 signed up to a vow drawn up by former prime minister @entity170 that included the continuation of the deal			1
anger on the conservative benches has been increased by the role of mr @entity170 , who appeared to be dictating the terms of eleventh - hour commitments to @entity3 from the three @entity16 parties			2
mr @entity48 was backed by other senior @entity138 as he called for ‘ fairness all round ’ in terms of public spending			0
the mayor , who will seek to return to @entity22 in next year ’s general election , insisted : ‘ you ca n’t have a situation where subsidies are given without some measure of fairness all round			0
what ’s sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander			0
‘ we ca n’t just go on with a system that even @entity265 himself thinks is outdated			0
’ he suggested that @entity173 , 91 , be asked to redesign the system so that the ‘ slightly reckless promise ’ to keep it could be honoured by maintaining its name			0
former environment secretary @entity272 demanded a recall of @entity22 to discuss the implications of the promises to @entity3 , a proposal rejected by commons leader @entity144			0
mr @entity272 welcomed the referendum result but said the ‘ chaotic manner ’ in which the no vote had been won had ‘ undermined the strong and resilient @entity154 on which we all depend ’			0
he added : ‘ it is unacceptable that an @entity283 leader was allowed to make rash promises ... to the @entity3 people with the endorsement of all three @entity154 party leaders , but with no mandate from @entity22			0
’ he said the @entity173 formula led to a ‘ lopsided ’ constitutional settlement and if it was not resolved fairly for all parts of the @entity154 , it ‘ will fall apart ’			0
@entity292 , the @entity19 chairman of the public administration select committee , said that what was ‘ right for @entity3 is also right for @entity35 ’			1
he expected further disputes with @entity3 nationalists ‘ because we ’ve really no idea what these promises of extra powers actually are or what is meant by honouring the @entity173 formula ’			1
a @entity31 source said : ‘ at no point have we said we intended to axe the formula			0
‘ we have talked this week about its continuation but that is in the context of devolving responsibility to the @entity22 to raise much more of the tax they spend			0
‘ the block grant will shrink from two - thirds of @entity3 spending to less than a half			0
so the @entity173 formula will be less and less significant in terms of funding			0

@entity2 made the promise hours after resounding no vote
it would bar @entity3 mps from having a say on issues in @entity35
@entity38 condemned the idea as a ' back of a fag packet solution '
@entity48 hit out at generous *pre-election* offer to the @entity3
