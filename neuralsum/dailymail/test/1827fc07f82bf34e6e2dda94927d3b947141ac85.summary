die - hard fans of the hit @entity2 series @entity3 are n’t just flocking to @entity4 as tourists , as interest in the programme has spurred demand for holiday homes along the county ’s picturesque coastline			1
a beachfront property with spectacular views has gone on the market for £ 3million , and it is already drawing interest from viewers who are enamoured with the series ’ stunning setting – and actor @entity19 ’s chiselled looks			1
since the series started airing last month estate agents said they have seen a rise in enquiries about the cottage , overlooking an ancient smugglers ’ cove on @entity4 ’s north coast , and other properties where the title character , @entity30 , plies his trade			1
boasting seven bedrooms , six reception rooms and seven bathrooms , the property has direct access to the beach and an amazing view of uninterrupted coast and open sea			1
the summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four , and they can be used separately to provide lots of space for a family			2
mr @entity52 said : ‘ the fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it 's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years			1
’ the scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline , but interest in the programme , based on @entity84 ’s @entity3 historical novels , set in the 18th century , is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost			1
boasting seven bedrooms , six reception rooms and seven bathrooms , the stunning property has direct access to the beach one of the larger bedrooms in the summer cottage offers amazing views of @entity40 on the northern coast of @entity4 the summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four , with uninterrupted views of the sea @entity97 is located just a few miles from some of the series ’ filming locations , including nearby @entity101 , which doubles as @entity102 , part of the @entity30 family estate , in the show			1
there are lots of ' @entity3 experiences ' now on offer in the county – with kayak , horseback and walking @entity3 tours			1
mr @entity52 added : ‘ i certainly think the @entity3 series has heightened @entity4 's appeal			1
there are lots of ' @entity3 experiences ' now on offer in the county – with kayak , horseback and walking @entity3 tours @entity97 is located just a few miles from some of the series ’ filming locations , including nearby @entity101 the show ’s popularity is coupled with the county ’s stunning scenery and history in making @entity4 a desirable destination ‘ there are more people coming down here more regularly and expressing interest in buying a second home			1
‘ properties on the coastline with these breathtaking views have got a lot of appeal and are incredibly popular , which the series has made people more aware of			2
’ the show ’s popularity is coupled with the county ’s stunning scenery and history in making @entity4 a desirable destination			1
estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in @entity4 since @entity30 began airing last month smuggling was rife in the 18th century , when @entity30 is set , and @entity4 's coast is full of hidden coves and tucked - away inlets			1
it was popular with smugglers because it had a long expanse of rocky , virtually uninhabited coast			2
with few revenue men to patrol it , goods like tea , brandy , rum and tobacco were smuggled in			0
all four of @entity160 's public toilets are out of service just weeks before summer @entity3 fans and thousands of other holidaymakers who are planning to visit a popular seaside town in @entity4 may have nowhere to go when nature calls			1
located in the heart of @entity3 country , the town of @entity160 is locked in a bizarre and long - running wrangle over public toilets			2
all four of the main public conveniences in @entity160 – where a @entity3 exhibition is being planned in may – are closed and with the summer tourist season fast approaching , there ’s no sign of the wee wrangle being resolved			2
the town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from @entity181 at the start of 2013			0
but more than two years later , the details of the transfer of ownership of three of them - @entity188 , the main car park and @entity190 – are still being worked out by the county council while the fourth block , at the @entity193 , is shut for refurbishment			0
town clerk @entity195 said : ‘ there is nothing more the town council can do to push it on ... it is still in the legal loop			0
‘ i am hopeful it will be completed soon			0
‘ the town council is really pleased to be able to take on the ownership of the toilets			0
‘ as a town council we feel we need to get the @entity193 toilets up and running and then go from there			0
it 's important that @entity160 has these facilities			2
’ the @entity193 toilets were already owned by the town council but leased to @entity181 , which has meant the handover could be completed more quickly			0
refurbishment work started last week and it is hoped they will be open within eight weeks , with the toilet for the disabled being available to use while work is done on the others			0
when they reopen , visitors will have to pay 20p per use to offset the cost to the town council of running them			0
mrs @entity195 added : ‘ the cost of running toilets is astronomical			0
‘ the town council simply does n't have the money to do it for nothing so it was felt that if we charge 20p it would be something towards it			0
’ @entity181 figures suggest it will cost a minimum of £ 26,000 a year to run the four sets of toilets , with the town having to cover insurance costs and business rates as well as cleaning , maintenance and consumables			0
until the transfer of ownership on the three blocks at the main car park , @entity190 and @entity188 , is completed , the responsibility for opening the toilets will rest with @entity181 .			0
