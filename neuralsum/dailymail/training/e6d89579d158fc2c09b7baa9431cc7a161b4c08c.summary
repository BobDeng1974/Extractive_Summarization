by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 9 august 2013 a shark scientist has found a 200lb sea lion inside the stomach of one of nature 's largest predators			1
the animal was lunch for the a gigantic 12 - foot mako shark that was caught off the coast of @entity12 by commercial fishermen			1
dr @entity14 has dissected over 2,000 stomachs in a bid to unravel mysteries of aquatic food chains , but the mako shark 's is her biggest yet			1
the shark 's blanket - sized stomach lining is pictured along with its last recent meals including the remains of a sea lion , which are laid out on the table dr @entity14 at the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) found a sea lion weighing 200lb ( 91 kg ) that was largely intact but had a flipper missing and multiple puncture - like bites to its body , inside the shark 's stomach			2
the stomach also harboured other bones that she plans on cleaning and identifying , according to the video which shows the dissection			0
to date , ms @entity14 has dissected more than 200 from mako shark stomachs to work out what the ' apex ' predators eat at the top of the food chain , @entity44 reported			1

while parts of the animal have been bitten off , it appears that the majority of it was swallowed whole the huge sharks regulate the populations of mid level predators , such as sea lions by mainly eating old and sick animals , which keeps the overall population healthier			0
consequently if the sharks disappear , there is a negative knock - on effect to their local ecosystem and the food chain			2
according to the @entity32 , up to 100 million sharks are killed each year for their meat - particularly their fins , which are used to make shark - fin soup and can fetch up to £ 380 a pound			2
here the scientist examines the sea lion 's head , which is remarkably intact considering it has been eaten by a shark and has been sitting in the digestive juices of its stomach the soup is a delicacy in @entity89 and can cost up to £ 108 a bowl despite containing high levels of toxins such as mercury			0
some species of shark such as the @entity96 , are also at risk of ' livering ' when their liver is removed by fisherman and their carcass tossed overboard as waste			0
shark livers are in demand as their livers and specifically a substance found in them called squalene , that helps control their buoyancy in water , is used in some luxury beauty creams			0
ms @entity14 spends time washing bones and straining gastric juices from the shark 's stomach to build up a thorough picture of the animal 's recent meals the premium substance costs up to £ 18,000 a ton			2
@entity24 eat anything but are partial to fish , squid , sea birds , other sharks and of course sea lions			0
ms @entity14 spends times washing bones and straining gastric juices to build up a thorough picture of the animals ' recent meals and said ' you can find all sorts of things in there			0
' this is the shark 's stomach before the contents are emptied and examined			0
ms @entity14 described the stomach lining as similar to a ' blanket ' in size and said some of the strangest things she has found in sharks ' stomachs include 24 pork steaks wrapped in paper , a soggy salad and even a bullet she described the stomach lining as similar to a ' blanket ' in size and said some of the strangest things she has found in sharks ' stomachs include 24 pork steaks wrapped in paper , a soggy salad and even a bullet			1
commercial fishermen caught the giant shark , which weighed 600 kilograms , and donated its organs to science			1
ms @entity14 's research is important as it gives scientists a picture of how the food chain works and the ecology and biology of sharks , which she believes is essential in order to work out a way of managing fisheries and helping species in the future			2
commercial fishermen caught the giant @entity24 shark , which weighed 600 kilograms and measured over 12 feet long , off the coast of @entity12			1
