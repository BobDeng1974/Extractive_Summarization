dramatic : the stand - off saw the antelope refuse to back down when the beast approached her calf - and at one point even clashed horns with it coming together : the antelope , @entity16 , kept her baby @entity18 behind her at all times as she charged at the massive rhino , @entity21 keepers say @entity16 , a scimitar oryx antelope , was being overly defensive of her baby on her first outing in the park following a difficult birth			1
this saw the calf , who lives at @entity40 near @entity41 , brought back to life by mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			2
@entity44 , a keeper at the park , said : ‘ @entity18 is @entity16 's seventh calf but her birth was not an easy one			2

’ taking him on : keepers say @entity16 , a scimitar oryx antelope , was being overly defensive of her baby in the park following a difficult birth coming together : the calf , who lives at @entity40 in @entity8 , was brought back to life by mouth - to - mouth resuscitation after birth but he added : ‘ happily @entity18 made a full recovery and that was why she was allowed out in to the park properly			1
‘ however , it may be that @entity16 was even more protective than usual as a result and decided to stand her ground			0
@entity21 was almost certainly just being inquisitive and meant no harm at all			0
