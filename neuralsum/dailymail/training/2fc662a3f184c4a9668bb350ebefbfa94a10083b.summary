man city must dominate in europe to keep @entity2 @entity3 , gayle and @entity5 deserve @entity7 recognition in may 2013 @entity8 left the @entity10 pitch having captained @entity11 against the @entity12			1
he said this : ' it ’s a very proud moment for me and one i ’ll never forget			0
i wanted to be captain , it was a dream come true			0
i ’ve lived a little boy ’s dream today			0
' less than a year on @entity8 has retired from international football , after he got the dreaded call from @entity22 , telling him he would n’t be going to the @entity23			2
where did it all go wrong ? i blame @entity26 – he ’s had a detrimental effect on @entity8 ’s career twice now , and that ’s sackable in my book			2
he was sometimes the @entity49 ’ biggest threat – here ’s one example : he was described as @entity47 ’s ' most menacing attacker ' when he got the winner at @entity54 in september 2004 , which is incredible when you think that @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 were all playing that day			0
@entity8 claimed @entity47 went back on a promise so off he went to @entity44 where @entity26 barely let him go over the halfway line			1
he regularly got into the opposition box at @entity47 – he has never scored for a @entity26 team			0
@entity8 ’s game changed – he won medals at @entity44 of course , but his development has n't reached a high level - he should have gone on to be the very best attacking full - back in the world for a decade			1
danger man : @entity8 was described as the ' most menacing attacker ' on the field when @entity47 won 1 - 0 at @entity54 back in september 2004 ( pictured ) on the rampage : @entity8 in action for @entity11 during a @entity23 qualifier with @entity76 at @entity77 in 2004 forward thinker : @entity8 takes on the @entity80 defence in a @entity23 qualifier back in march 2001 @entity26 returned and single - handedly wrecked any chance @entity8 had of going to another @entity23			1
he picked a right - back at left - back , leaving @entity8 out in the cold			1
sure , @entity87 had a good season , but ultimately @entity44 had an unsuccessful season			2
was it worth it ? what point was @entity26 making by leaving @entity8 out ? @entity8 played over 50 games in 2012 - 13 , and ended the season as @entity11 captain			1
he had no reason to think a year on he would n’t be a @entity44 regular , and would n’t be going to the @entity23			2
competition : @entity8 's place at left - back has been taken by @entity87 this season , a natural right - back solid : the @entity104 has adapted well to the @entity105 and @entity8 has been unable to regain his place when he looks back on his career , @entity8 will be able to count a lot of medals – he has won everything the club game can bring			1
but he will also realise @entity26 ruined his career not once , but twice			0
i ’m gutted for @entity8 , i ’ve interviewed him a few times but i do n’t know him as a person			0
as a footballer he has amazing talent			0
@entity26 has robbed him of the chance to be the undisputed best player in his position in the world by not allowing him to express himself on the pitch			0
and now the @entity44 manager has robbed @entity8 of a chance to play at another @entity23 .			1

@entity8 announced his retirement from @entity11 duty
@entity44 defender was left out of @entity22 's @entity23 squad
left - back has been *shackled* by @entity26 's *tactics*
@entity44 manager has *favoured* right - back @entity87 in @entity8 's role
