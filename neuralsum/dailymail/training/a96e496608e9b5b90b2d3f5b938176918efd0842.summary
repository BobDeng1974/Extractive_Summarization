@entity0 has welcomed the prospect of @entity4 ’s @entity3 challenge receiving help from above but warned there will be no preferential treatment for star names			1
with the under - 21s having stylish secured a trip to the @entity11 next summer , @entity4 have already started preparing for the tournaments by lining up two demanding friendlies in november , at home against @entity16 and a trip to @entity18			1
a debate is raging , though , as to which players @entity20 should select			1
if , for instance , @entity4 included all those who were eligible , from players such as @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , they would have to be considered favourites			1
@entity0 ( centre ) insists any senior players that drop into @entity4 's under 21s are not certain of a start defender @entity36 ( left ) played both @entity38 play - off legs against @entity39 loading the squad with high - profile individuals is not something @entity20 will do			1
@entity4 will certainly travel with a strong squad but the identity of who goes will be decided by @entity20 , @entity46 and @entity47 , the @entity48 ’s technical director			1
@entity20 and @entity47 put individual cases forward to @entity46 for those in the seniors who are eligible to play for the under - 21s and that , for example , is what happened this month with @entity56 left - back @entity36			1
@entity46 agreed that it would be better for @entity36 to play two games against @entity39 , rather than spending time on the bench against @entity60 and @entity61 , and he would also have released @entity62 , had @entity65 defender @entity63 not damaged his ankle ligaments			1
@entity36 slotted back into @entity20 ’s group effortlessly and took nothing for granted and @entity0 , the under - 21s ’ captain , says that is an example others would have to follow if it is decided @entity4 ’s novices would benefit from taking some who have been with the seniors			1
@entity77 midfielder @entity76 ( left ) celebrates his winning goal against @entity39 on tuesday with @entity79 @entity29 is one of a number of players who could drop down to play at the @entity83 at this early stage , it would be no surprise if @entity65 midfielder @entity87 ended up heading to the @entity11 , but , for once @entity4 are not short of options			1
‘ that is why it is good being a player not a manager picking this squad , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we have a fantastic amount of talent in this 22 of players			2
we have had players who have gone up and come down			2
@entity36 has come down and it is like he never left			2
‘ we are confident whoever it is , we will get on really well			0
we will welcome anyone in			0
first of all we have to continue play the way we do			2
if people come down for the seniors it does n't mean they run things			2
everyone works for their position			0
that is the mentality we have had			0
‘ everyone fights for their place so they deserve it			0
we have to keep that next summer			2
we have got to carry that forward now to the bigger stage in the summer			0
losing and going out was not an option because we have too much talent			0
now we need some really tough friendlies			0
‘ playing against teams who will push us to the limit			0
but we have got to learn to play against the top teams			0
that is the only way we will be prepared for the finals next summer			0
then we will assess where we are at			0
’ senior squad regular @entity27 ( centre ) will also be eligible to play for the @entity130 next summer maintaining the balance and harmony of a group that has won 10 consecutive games and is undefeated in 13 matches will be essential if @entity4 are to stand any chance of winning the tournament , something of which @entity20 is well aware			1
he has explained at great length recently what he will be looking at when it comes to picking his final 23 , as while some big names could feasibly be picked – like @entity29 and @entity27 – @entity20 has questioned what they would gain from dropping down to the under - 21s			1
it will not , however , stop the discussion			0
@entity149 , @entity20 ’s predecessor , has consistently spoken out that @entity4 will never progress as a football nation until they get into the habit of naming their strongest possible squad for these tournaments			1
‘ i love him because he fights my battles for me ! ’ @entity20 said with a telling smile			2
‘ but i set out from the start saying i am not going to worry about who i ca n’t have			2
some of those things will be taken out of our hands with injuries and things like that			0
‘ i still think if a young player is first choice in the senior team – like @entity29 – then it is hard for a development coach to deny them that opportunity			1
there is a different debate if they are not in the team			0
myself and @entity46 have talked about that a lot and that will be ongoing			0

a number of senior players are eligible to play for @entity4 under 21s
@entity29 , @entity27 and @entity87 are among those who could play at the @entity83 next summer
but @entity0 insists anyone who drops down will not take over
@entity36 is back in the under 21 squad after going to the @entity187
@entity20 says he wo n't worry about who he ca n't pick
