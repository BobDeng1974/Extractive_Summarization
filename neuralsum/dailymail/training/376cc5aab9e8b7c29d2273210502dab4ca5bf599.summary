’ ‘ i feel i have been out there in @entity66 , in press conferences fully answering the questions , fully transparent , very clear about what needs to be done – making sure that @entity57 gets to the bottom of what has been a terrible episode in terms of what newspapers have done , and also some very big questions about potential police corruption			1
we need to get to the bottom of those			0
’ mr @entity3 insisted the cases of mr @entity17 and mr @entity25 , the former deputy editor of the @entity159 , were ‘ really quite different ’			0
