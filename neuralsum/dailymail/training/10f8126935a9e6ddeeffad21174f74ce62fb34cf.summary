by @entity0 last updated at 4:53 pm on 10th january 2012 one woman died and at least 20 other people were seriously injured in a stampede today when around 5,000 prospective students rushed to register at a university in @entity6			1
officials at the @entity8 said two of the victims were fighting for their lives in hospital after being caught up in the crush at around 8am			2
the institution 's vice-chancellor , @entity16 , said the tragedy happened as hopeful students and their parents pushed to get through the university 's main gates for the chance to secure late registration for the new academic year , which starts later this month			1
' the outcome was that there was a lady who was the front who was crushed and she passed away			0
' two other people suffered very serious injuries and we fear for their lives			2
' prof @entity16 identified the dead woman as the mother of a male prospective student who came to the university today to apply for a place to study			2
he said : ' the situation was particularly tragic as the young man was inside the registration tent and had no idea that this had happened			0
' we are offering counselling and support to those who have been affected by this			0
' help at hand : paramedics treat an injured woman among discarded clothing , shoes and litter			2
the full scale of situation remains unclear melee : some students fall to the ground as others desperately try to make room for themselves amid the chaos the university 's security manager @entity83 said several thousand students and their parents formed a long queue outside the institution 's city centre campus from the early hours of this morning			1
he said several people were injured in the stampede after officials opened the gates to ease pressure on those stuck at the front			1
he said : ' at around 7.30am , we noticed a crowd outside the main entrance			0
' we deployed security officers outside the campus , but those at the back started pushing forward and pushing people in front of them			2
we at that stage had no choice but to open the gate			0
' but at that stage , it was too late for three people who were trampled			1
' discarded shoes , clothing and blankets today lay at the scene of the tragedy by the gates of the university 's @entity119 campus in @entity123 's central @entity122 suburb			1
meanwhile , officials confirmed they had suspended the registration of prospective students while they decided how best to proceed following the incident			2
keen learners : aspiring students queued for hours this morning in the hope of gaining a sought - after place for next year patient : places are highly competitive , leading some critics to call for tougher raise the standards of entrance criteria @entity123 emergency services spokeswoman @entity137 said the number of people injured in the stampede had risen to 20			1
she added that emergency personnel would remain at the scene all day to ensure the situation remained calm			0
she said : ' the situation is that there are currently three people in critical , but stable conditions and 17 who suffered minor injuries			1
' it is a hot day and we are worried that people might collapse as they wait outside to enter			0
' meanwhile , paramedic spokesman @entity153 confirmed at least one woman was put on a ventilator at the scene and said another eight suffered injuries			0
he said : ' the full scale of the situation remains unclear , but we can confirm that one woman remains in a critical condition after she suffered severe head and chest trauma			0
' officials said today 's stampede was caused by a desperation to access limited places at @entity6 's universities			1
like universities in @entity171 , most students apply for places months in advance			1
however spaces on courses at some institutions are offered at the last minute , usually to students from poorer backgrounds who achieved well in their final school examinations			0
the lack of widespread internet access and poor careers advice in rural or township areas means thousands of prospective applicants are forced to turn up in person to register their interest in further studies			0
moving on up : hundreds of thousands of students received the results of the country 's school - leavers exams last week experts believe the problem is symptomatic of a higher education system which has failed to expand adequately to @entity6 ' growing demand for university places following the end of apartheid			1
before the advent of democracy in 1994 , university places were limited largely to the white population and a tiny black elite			1
however , students from all backgrounds are now able to apply for further studies , with many choosing to do so in a country where poverty and unemployment remain common			2
some critics argue that standards at @entity6 universities have fallen in recent years and suggest entrance criteria should be raised			0
the @entity8 describes itself as a ' comprehensive ' institution which offers courses ranging from diplomas to degrees			0
last year , it received more than 85,000 applications for fewer than 12,000 places on its undergraduate courses			0
it is situated across several campuses in @entity123 , the country 's largest city .			1

at least 20 people injured , three critical , in crush in @entity123
students and parents surged through gates to secure late places
*frenzy* symptomatic of country 's failure to meet university demand
