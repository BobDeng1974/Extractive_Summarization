by @entity0 published : 03:03 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 26 august 2013 @entity3 piers across @entity4 are under threat from rising maintenance costs and rocketing insurance bills , new research has claimed			1
too many piers are trapped in a cycle of neglectful ownership with only periodic attempts at conservation , according to @entity13 , the author of the @entity16 ’s @entity15 report published today			2
she believes that a new option of taking piers into community ownership , which is being pioneered for @entity21 , could be the answer to the problem			1
popular attraction : despite around six million people visiting @entity4 's piers , including @entity27 , pictured , many could fall into disrepair ( @entity31 photo ) the report claims that 57 seaside piers are under threat , not only from corrosive sea water but from owners who fail to make provisions for the high maintenance costs and insurance bills , estimated at around £ 33m over the next five years			1
the study , published by the trade association @entity41 , examines the ownership , usage and future of @entity4 ’s piers			1
it highlights the crisis , offering a blueprint for their future revival as co-operatively owned assets for the benefit of the community			2
@entity3 piers remain as popular as ever , with six million people a year visiting them , according to the research			1
@entity21 , which was ravaged by fire in october 2010 , has been returned to local ownership ahead of a £ 14 million project to revive the battered @entity60 structure			2
most of the money has been raised by the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , with help from the @entity65 , the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
work will start this month on the @entity72 - listed pier in @entity73 and will be completed by spring 2015 , turning it into the ' @entity75 ' , officials said			0
wreck : the @entity76 in @entity67 , @entity73 , was one of many piers to have been hit by disaster when it was destroyed by fire in october 2010 but has been saved as part of a £ 14 million restoration project up to 95per cent of the pier was left a burnt - out eyesore when it was almost destroyed in an arson attack three years ago following years of neglect			0
two men , then aged 18 and 19 , were arrested shortly afterwards but the @entity89 later said there was not enough evidence to bring charges			0
@entity93 , the @entity95 - registered owners , failed to do anything to the structure and when they could not be contacted @entity67 sought a compulsory purchase order so the pier could be handed over to specially set up trust called the @entity101			0
salvation : @entity15 could be saved for the nation if more are taken into community ownership , the study claimed ( stock picture ) now it is in their hands , work will begin to renovate the substructure , refurbish the only pavilion still standing and to build a new visitor centre , a spokesman for the trust said			1
at present 56 per cent of piers are privately owned , with 39 % in local authority hands and 5 % in community ownership , the report said			1
it is calling for a fast - track compulsory transfer process to rescue important community and heritage assets and a presumption in favour of local communities taking ownership			2
ms @entity13 said : ' more people live by the seaside than live in @entity129 and 10 % of our national heritage assets are within a mile of the sea			0
' @entity3 piers make us smile			0
but too many piers are trapped in a cycle of neglectful ownership with only periodic attempts at conservation			0
' we believe that there is a new option , now being pioneered for @entity21 , which is to take piers into local community ownership			1
' @entity144 , @entity145 until 2012 , said : ' for piers across the country , exposed at all times to sea and weather , there is a real challenge in meeting the high financial costs of upkeep and insurance			2
' i applaud the search for new solutions to our national assets that can harness the passion and commitment that comes with co-operative and community models			0
' communities secretary @entity165 said : ' the complete turnaround in @entity21 ’s fortunes is yet another great example of what is happening across the country when government gives power back to communities to decide how best to run things locally			0
' a host of important local assets , from football stadiums to shops and pubs , are now being listed as community assets and i ’d encourage seaside communities to nominate the piers they care about with their local councils as a first step to securing their future			1

57 piers across @entity4 could be *closed* *forever* , study finds
high maintenance costs and insurance bills many owners are allowing them to fall into disrepair , according to report
