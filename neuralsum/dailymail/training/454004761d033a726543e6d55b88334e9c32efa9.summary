an olympic gold medal , comparisons to @entity2 and even praise from teen heartthrob @entity4 - not a bad way to spend the summer vacation before your senior year of high school			1
but @entity10 is taking it all in her stride			1
after qualifying for a record seven races in women 's olympics swimming events , @entity13 has already nabbed a gold and a team bronze - fast propelling her into the hearts of @entity20 and sports fans			1
despite her amazing feats , @entity13 has refused to accept cash prizes or sponsorship deals			2
instead she is holding on to her amateur status so she can swim for a college team - when she is old enough			1
@entity20 's golden girl : @entity10 poses with her gold medal for the women 's 100 - meter backstroke and her aggressive performances in the water could not be further from her gentle demeanor when she climbs out , reverting back to the modest school girl who looks almost surprised to be there			1
' i dreamed about this moment my whole life , ' @entity13 gushed after winning the gold medal in the women 's 100 - metre backstroke on monday			1
' i finally got one after 17 years ! ' @entity13 , an only child from @entity42 , @entity43 , credits the unwavering support of her parents , @entity47 and @entity48 , for her success			0
it was thanks to encouragement from her father , a former senior executive of @entity57 who now works for a non-profit environmental company , and his wife that @entity13 pursued the sport , she said			2
young talent : @entity10 , pictured , began swimming lessons as a toddler after he parents spotted her talent at home : @entity10 is the only child of @entity13 , pictured , and her husband @entity48 patriotic : her parents are @entity70 but @entity10 , dressed in patriotic colours , left , chose to swim for the @entity20 ' they have been the best support in the whole world , ' she told @entity76 's today show			1
' i know that no matter what i do at any meet , if i do my best they are going to be proud of me			0
' when @entity13 was two years old , she was in the sea with her mother when a fish caught her eye and she paddled after it - leaving her mother behind in the 12 - foot deep water			2
and so the love affair began : home movies show @entity13 paddling frantically towards her father , barely able to keep her head above water - but celebrating with her parents when she got there			2
this determination torpedoed @entity13 to the 2008 @entity97 when she was just 13 , and later to the @entity99 as the youngest @entity20 team member at 15			2
early days : she swims with her mother , who says @entity10 has smiled since the day she was born always ahead : a home video shows her beating her classmates during a elementary school meet at home : @entity13 shocked her parents when she swam alone , aged two , and took her to swimming lessons by 16 , she had achieved a world record in short - course metres in the 200 backstroke and won five medals , including three golds , at the 2011 world championships in @entity115			1
height 6 ft 1 with such height - the average girl her age is 5 ft 4 - @entity119 has less wave drag and is able to glide easier through the water			1
she can take turns faster as she reaches the wall long before the centre of her body does @entity126 6 ft 4 the lengthy measurement from fingertip to fingertip means she can pull her body further feet size 13 her large feet , which are five sizes larger than the average @entity20 woman 's , act like flippers through the water hands 8 1/2 inches from wrist to fingertip like her feet , the large hands act as paddles			0
with greater surface area , she has more thrust through the pool shoulders 18 inches her shoulders mean her torso is wider at the top than at her narrow hips , which makes a more streamlined shape through the water the teen is built for success , with a powerful 6 - foot - 1 frame , size 13 feet that act as flippers and a 6 - foot - 4 - inch wingspan			1
her hands measure eight - and - a - half inches from her wrist to her longest fingertip , which she uses as a paddle to power her through the water			2
it is the frame she hopes can help her win an unprecedented seven medals at the @entity165 - one of the reasons she is often referred to as the female @entity2			2
as her parents are @entity70 , they offered their daughter the option to swim for @entity70 , but their daughter refused , pointing out the support she has had from her hometown and high school			1
@entity13 manages to squeeze hours of training around her schoolwork , exam prep and social life at @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity43 , but admits it 's not always easy			0
' swimming - there 's so much energy you have to put into it and i want to go to practice and work hard , so there 's days when i ca n't stay out late , i ca n't go out with my friends , ' she said			2
in a recent interview with @entity76 , she burst into giggles over @entity4 and boyband @entity194 - reminding audiences of the @entity196 's young age			2
and the admiration is mutual , as @entity4 tweeted on tuesday : ' heard @ @entity198 is a fan of mine			0
now im a fan of hers too			0
congrats on winning gold ! # muchlove ' thankful : @entity10 , an only child , credits the support of her parents @entity47 and @entity206 , for her success encouragement : a younger @entity10 with her parents , who travel with her to competitions across the globe normal teen : @entity10 , who will start her senior year of high school this fall , also manages to maintain a normal life as a teen			1
here , she is pictured with her date for her prom earlier this summer @entity13 tweeted in response : ' i just died			0
thank you ! ' amid the high pressure of @entity223 races , high school exams and teen boybands , @entity13 has also found time to think of others , paying tribute to the victims of the recent @entity43 shootings			1
the teen attends school and trains in @entity180 - the town where a gunman slayed 12 and injured 58 in a shooting spree during a screening of @entity236 on july 20			1
' every single race i ’m going to have that in the back of my mind , ' she said before the @entity223			1
' hopefully , i can make @entity43 proud and bring a little bit of light there			0
' with her all - american image and outstanding performances in the pool , there is a fair buck for the youngster to make			2
but although companies are offering lucrative sponsorship deals and the country 's top coaches and high - profile agents have been banging at her door for years , @entity13 has turned them away			1
spirit : @entity10 , who says she particularly loves the team aspect of the @entity223 , celebrates a school win popular : @entity10 , with friends from her school swimming team , attends a @entity265 high school in @entity43 night out : the swimmer , pictured with a school friend , said she often has to skip socialising to train @entity269 , the executive creative director at a @entity271 advertising firm , said she may be giving up the chance to make more than $ 1 million in endorsements if her success continues			1
' if you use @entity2 as a gauge and how much he ’s made , it ’s maybe in the low seven figures that she could be leaving on the table , ' @entity269 told @entity280			0
she has already given up $ 115,000 in prize money ; the @entity282 pays gold medallists $ 25,000 and @entity20 adds a $ 75,000 bonus			1
her bronze would have earned her $ 15,000			1
but @entity13 remains firm about turning down the cash in exchange for an amateur career and a place swimming for a college			2
' swimming in college has always been a dream of mine , ' she said			2
' it just seems amazing			0
i want to be a part of it			0
' famous fan : @entity299 @entity4 tweeted his praise to @entity10 - who responded : ' i just died ! thankyou ! ' @entity301 : @entity13 , pictured on monday , said she swims because she loves it - not because of the money to be made camaraderie : she hugs @entity306 's @entity305 , right , after they took first and second place in the race whether she can maintain such resistance as the races - and hopefully trips to the podium - continue , remains to be seen			1
' right now i 'm doing what i love , ' she added			0
' that 's honestly the reason why i 'm doing it			0
' and that love is paying off			0
@entity13 stunned spectators when minutes after swimming a 200m freestyle semifinal heat , she climbed back in the pool to win gold in the 100m backstroke on monday			0
' i am , so happy , i knew that tonight was definitely going to be difficult , with that double , but i had a blast tonight , ' @entity13 said afterwards			0
she appeared in disbelief as she was awarded her medal , every emotion dancing in her eyes as the national anthem played			0
teamwork : @entity10 , right , also took a bronze medal in the women 's 4x100 - metre freestyle relay on saturday			1
she is pictured with , from left , @entity338 , @entity339 and @entity340 advice : she has been called the female @entity2 , right , as she is also in line for numerous medals smile of a winner : @entity10 's next chance at a medal is on tuesday night in the 200m freestyle swim ' i was trying to sing , ' she said			1
' but i was crying at the same time and i forgot the words because i did n't know what i was doing			0
i was just a huge mess			0
' but seeing that flag being raised was so incredibly unbelievable			0
i could have never dreamed it would feel like that			0
' she still has a fair few battles on her hands to achieve her dream of securing seven medals , placing her ahead of @entity361 , the first @entity20 woman to win six medals in one @entity223 in @entity363			1
her next shot at a third medal comes at tuesday night 's 200m freestyle swim			0
' i know that it 's going to be tough , ' she said			0
' but like @entity2 [ @entity2 ] said , it 's all mental and i think that i 'm prepared to do it			0
