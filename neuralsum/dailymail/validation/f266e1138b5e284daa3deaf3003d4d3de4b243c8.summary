@entity0 today announced its annual profits were up 12 per cent to £ 5.5billion in 2014			1
ceo @entity2 took a £ 1.1million bonus , taking his overall pay package to £ 5.5million , as he said the bank is in its best position since the 2008 financial crash			1
but mr @entity2 also revealed @entity0 has set aside another £ 750million to pay fines for rigging foreign currency rates , taking its total bill for the scandal to £ 1.25billion			1
his payout will prove controversial after a year in which @entity0 slashed 14,000 jobs - with another 5,000 to go by 2016 - and closed a net 72 branches			2
this morning shares were down around 5p to £ 2.58 each when the @entity18 opened this morning			0
@entity0 boss : @entity2 has accept his first bonus since taking the helm in 2012 , as his bank enjoyed £ .5.5billion profits for 2014 the @entity25 bank is braced for huge penalties from @entity27 and @entity29 regulators after refusing to reach a settlement in november			1
today it was announced @entity0 also added £ 200 million to provide for the ongoing compensation programme for customers mis - sold payment protection insurance			1
@entity2 had assured investors that the 2014 bonus round would be ' less controversial ' after a bitter row last year			1
shareholders were furious that bonus payments reached £ 2.4billion in 2013 despite falling profits			2
this year , with improved results , the bonus pool is around £ 1.8billion			1
calling his own bonus ' appropriate ' he said today : ' @entity0 today is a stronger business , with better prospects , than at any time since the financial crisis			1
' he added : ' you have to look at the very significant progress that we have made in @entity0 in the two - and - a - half years that i have been chief executive			2
' i completely understand that i am very well remunerated for what i do			0
but i think it is appropriate that i accept my bonus			0
' it is not a decision i take lightly and i declined it in the previous two years			0
when i come to 2015 , i will do the same careful thinking about whether i should accept it given the progress the bank has made			0
' mr @entity2 ' bonus is his first since taking the helm in 2012 and will be justified because @entity0 ' profits rose this year and were around £ 300million better than expected			1
but it remains in trouble after its bankers were found to be rigging foreign currency rates			2
@entity0 drew fire from investors last november after it declined to be part of a settlement reached between six banks – including @entity72 and @entity73 – and the @entity74 and @entity29 watchdog the @entity75			2
banks , including @entity0 , face fines from a range of regulators , including the @entity80 and the @entity81 , for manipulating the £ 3.5trillion - a - day forex market			2
contrast : after a year @entity0 has described as its best since 2014 , it recorded a rise in pre-tax profits and reduced its bonus pot to a five - year low but when the other five banks involved settled last , @entity0 did not , so could face a higher fine as a result			1
it said today it was seeking a ' more general co-ordinated settlement ' - with other authorities in the @entity29 still investigating the scandal			0
@entity0 said it is reviewing its foreign exchange trading over a several - year period and continuing to co-operate with relevant bodies , and that these probes could result in ' substantial monetary penalties '			1
mr @entity2 said : ' we remain focused on addressing outstanding conduct issues , including those related to foreign exchange trading			1
' i regard the behaviour at the centre of these investigations as wholly incompatible with our values , and i share the frustration of colleagues and shareholders that matters like these continue to cast a shadow over our business			0
' but resolving these issues is an important part of our plan for @entity0 and , although it may be difficult , i expect that we will make significant progress on this issue in 2015			2
' finance director @entity120 said : ' we will take action where that is required up to and including termination of employment			0
' staff involved in the scandal could also see bonuses clawed back , he added			0
the bank has not disclosed information about employees being fired or suspended over the affair			0
changes : in 2014 @entity0 slashed 14,000 jobs - with another 5,000 to go by 2016 - and closed a net 72 branches the results come after a year in which @entity0 shut 89 branches while opening 17 amid an increasing push for customers to contact it via @entity141 or by telephone , or to use post office banking or new sites in @entity146 stores			1
mr @entity120 said : ' we have no target for branch closures			0
it is really a reflection of how our customers choose to bank			0
' @entity155 analyst @entity154 described the statutory result after accounting for one - off charges as ' weak '			0
but @entity159 's @entity158 said : ' despite the earnings shortfall versus our estimates ... we believe that the company is making good progress towards reshaping the business and improving balance sheet strength			0
' @entity168 general secretary @entity167 said : ' profits have fallen at @entity0 and they have had to make huge provision for fines			0
' the chief executive rightly recognises that the bank 's culture must change , but it is hard to have a positive view of any organisation that pays its boss £ 5.5 million in a single year - a sum that would take a full - time worker on the minimum wage 465 years to earn			1

@entity0 ' results are best since the 2008 financial crisis , bank says
ceo @entity2 took £ 1.1m bonus - taking his pay to £ 5.5m for 2014
@entity189 says average @entity0 worker would take 465 years to earn money
extra £ 750m set aside to pay £ 1.2bn bill for foreign exchange rate - rigging
