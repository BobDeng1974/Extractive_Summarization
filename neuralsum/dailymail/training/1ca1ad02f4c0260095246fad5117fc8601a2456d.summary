a young mother is asking the @entity2 court to overturn a state - imposed do - not - resuscitate order for her baby daughter , who , in a medical miracle , came out of a coma after she was placed in her mother 's arms to die			1
the one - year - old , @entity9 , is brain - damaged and blind after her 22 - year - old father @entity11 allegedly violently shook her on december 21 in an apartment he shared with her 17 - year - old mother @entity13			1
the baby was placed under state custody because of the alleged child abuse , but @entity13 's parental rights have not been terminated , and she 's fighting the state 's imposition of a do - not - resuscitate ( @entity22 ) order on the girl			1
the child went into a ' deep coma ' after the alleged shaking incident and doctors informed the mother that she was ' neurologically devastated , ' reports @entity29			0
@entity13 agreed to the @entity22 order after being informed of her daughter 's grave condition			1
however , after @entity9 was removed from a ventilator and put into her mother 's arms to die , she began breathing on her own and opened her eyes			1
she eventually became alert and the parents canceled the @entity22 order			1
however , medical personnel wanted to reinstate the order because the baby girl 's still - grave condition			2
the @entity43 @entity42 then obtained authority to do so , without terminating the mother 's parental rights			0
the judge said that it was in @entity9 's ' best interest ' not to ' endure a cascading series of events that would inevitably lead to her death			2
' the @entity54 attorneys and several other groups have filed a friend - of - the - court brief in support of @entity13 , saying that state officials do not have the constitutional right to make the choice for @entity13 's child			1
right to life : @entity9 's mother wants to overturn a state - imposed do - not - resuscitate order for the baby ' even when a state agency believes the parent ’s decision to be incorrect , that does not permit it to interfere in the parent ’s right to make medical decisions for her child , ' the brief reads			1
' the state is effectively arguing that this mom is n’t fit to make medical decisions for her child simply because she wants the child to live			0
no one has declared this mother an unfit parent , yet the government wants to take her place , ' @entity54 senior counsel @entity79 told wnd			0
' the @entity86 should reaffirm @entity87 ’ interest in life , parental rights , and the integrity of the medical profession by reversing the lower court and restoring this mom ’s full rights to make medical decisions on her daughter ’s behalf			2
' according to @entity85 , @entity11 ran a stop sign with @entity9 in the car and was pulled over by police			2
they noticed the child needed medical help and drove the father and daughter to hospital			0
@entity9 was bailed out of jail in january after pleading not guilty to felony assault and felony aggravated assault			0
' everyone deserves a fighting chance to live			0
all this mother is doing is fighting for that chance for her baby , ' said @entity54 senior counsel @entity79			0
' this mother ’s parental rights should not be ignored ; no one has the authority to deny her the right to save her daughter ’s life			0
