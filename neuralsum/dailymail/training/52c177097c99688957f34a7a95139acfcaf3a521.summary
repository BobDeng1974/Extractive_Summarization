critical : dr @entity21 attacked the mental health centre his daughter @entity23 visited the day before her death for missing opportunities to save her her father , dr @entity21 , told the court that staff at the crisis centre should have made more effort to contact her doctors after she left , adding : ' there were so many opportunities to help her at this point and they were not taken			1
' her body was discovered by her partner mr @entity37 at her £ 350,000 two - bedroom rented flat in @entity39 , north @entity8			1
miss @entity7 had stayed at @entity40 , a rehabilitation centre on @entity42 in @entity43 , in may 2009 , after being signed off from work with stress in may 2009			1
the £ 10,000 - a - week @entity40 , whose former patients also include singer @entity48 , has since been shut down after it was discovered to be operating as an unlicensed hospital			1
but she left the following september because she struggled to cope with the methods being used to treat her			0
while there she argued with staff about her care and harmed herself , and the day before she left she made an apparent suicide attempt			2
dr @entity7 said : ' she was rejected , in my view , by the @entity40 and the manager , a hotelier by trade , who said she had to leave in 20 minutes			1
happier times : @entity7 , centre , aged 16 with her parents @entity21 and @entity64 ‘ i am not quite sure of the clinical basis of that decision , but this preceded the crisis			1
’ miss @entity7 found the therapy at @entity71 was largely focused on addictive patients , and struggled to get the treatment she wanted , the court heard			1
she was given a combination of drugs , including anti-depressants , and underwent @entity77 , a form of psychotherapy used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder			0
after the treatment started , miss @entity7 's family said she contacted them less frequently			2
her mother , @entity64 , discovered when she later visited that her daughter had been self - harming , and was burning her arms with cigarettes			2
dr @entity7 said his wife had been ' aghast ' when she saw her daughter , describing her as ' extremely thin , lifeless and medicated at that point in time '			2
miss @entity7 also told her mother she had become extremely distressed following the @entity77 sessions , and was left in a ' dissociative state '			2
a friend who visited complained about the medication she was given , as did miss @entity7 , and in september 2009 she was told to leave the centre			1
mr @entity37 , left , found miss @entity7 's body after she overdosed at her £ 350,000 rented flat in @entity39 but one of her psychiatrists called her a ' narcissist ' who thought she was a ' superior human being , ' the inquest heard			1
consultant psychiatrist dr @entity104 , who treated miss @entity7 during her stay at @entity71 , said she took an instant dislike to him and was difficult to help			1
he told the court : ' she told me she was wary of doctors			2
i do n't think she had a very high opinion of the abilities of the doctors treating her			2
' she was polite but frosty and had a veiled aggression towards me			0
she could be curt , dismissive			0
' she would n't discuss her suicidal thoughts with me as she was frightened if she did she would be sectioned			0
' he added : ' she was narcissistic			0
she had a high opinion of herself and her own intelligence and ability to control her mental state			0

dr @entity7 said : ' we find it absolutely incredible that no one - after @entity23 had stormed out in an obviously deeply distressed state - no one at the crisis centre had impressed on the gp centre the importance of the situation			1
' she was known to be suicidal , and she had said at @entity40 she would not commit suicide on the premises			0
the importance of that to me is quite clear			0
‘ her doctor said if someone had contacted him , he would have been in touch with @entity23 straight away			0
’ the court heard miss @entity7 , who was born in @entity148 , had been ' delightful , intelligent and articulate ' , studying at @entity149 before gaining a master 's degree at @entity151			2
she was a commissioning editor at @entity4 , in charge of making top programmes like @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0

her father said : ' she became at first extremely stressed and then psychologically unwell			0
