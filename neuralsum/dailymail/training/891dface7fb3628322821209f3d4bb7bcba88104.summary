the @entity9 faced legal claims from 1,700 women who suffered pain and distress after being fitted with defective @entity15 implants			1
but last week , the cosmetic surgery chain appointed administrators after its management complained that legal action could put the firm out of business			1
outrage : protesters targeted the @entity24 premises over the scandal the @entity26 has learned the group has transferred all of its doctors and clinics to a new company to allow it to continue performing cosmetic treatments – but without the threat of legal action by the damaged women			1
it was revealed last year the @entity38 - made @entity15 implants could rupture and leak industrial - grade silicone into the body			0
there were fears the substance could be toxic and cause cancer , although there is no evidence for this so far			0
last night there was cross-party support for an investigation into the company 's actions			1
health minister @entity53 said : ' it is extremely disappointing that the @entity24 has chosen to do this			0

we will be looking into this as a matter of urgency			0
' still operating : @entity9 founder @entity67 with specialist cosmetic surgery nurse @entity68 shadow health secretary @entity70 said he would today write to health secretary @entity71 to ask for the @entity72 and @entity73 to look at the issue			1
mr @entity70 said : ' it 's an example of capitalism at its most irresponsible and unethical			2
it 's a straight - forward breach of the duty of care that any doctor – public or private – owes to a patient			1
' it raises questions about their fitness to practise			0
all avenues should be explored , including an appeal to the @entity72 in terms of their registration , and to the @entity73 in terms of whether any practitioners have broken professional codes			0
to wash their hands of this is not acceptable			0
' @entity24 , set up in 1984 by @entity96 entrepreneur @entity67 , has played a controversial central role in the @entity15 scandal			0
the chain supplied more of the implants than any other @entity1 firm , fitting them in 13,900 women between 2001 and 2011			0
manufactured by @entity38 firm @entity104 , which went into liquidation , the rupture rate was far higher than for other implants , and some contained non-medical silicone normally used in mattress production			0
faulty : defective silicone gel breast implant manufactured by @entity111 ( @entity15 ) removed from a patient the government agreed to remove and replace those that the @entity115 gave to 3,000 women , and claimed private clinics had a ' moral duty ' to offer the same service			2
however , in january , chief executive mr @entity67 announced the company could not afford to meet the cost and claimed the government should foot the bill			2
many of @entity9 's patients complained they could not get through to the company by phone , while the firm said it would only remove for free those implants that had ruptured			1

on thursday the @entity153 revealed administrators @entity155 had been appointed by the company on november 9			2
@entity157 , from @entity158 , acting for the company and the administrators , said : ' they are still functioning as before , still providing surgery and honouring bookings			2
' it 's the same directors , surgeons , premises and website but under a different holding company			1
' the liabilities will not be transferred			0
the liabilities resulting from the class action die with the previous company			1
' women scheduled to have @entity176 removed by @entity9 will still have that done			1
the only difference is that legal claims against @entity9 will no longer be able to take place			1
' there are 3,000 women involved in a @entity15 class action , being led by solicitor @entity183 at @entity184			2
the majority are taking action against @entity9			1
bankruptcy : the @entity24 deliberately went into administration to avoid a possible multi-million pound legal payout a legal source said : ' lawyers are in discussions with administrators with a view to exploring the other remedies that are available			2
' women who have paid for surgery with a credit card will be able to pursue claims against their credit card companies			0
' and it may still be possible to take action against individual doctors rather than the clinic			1
' a spokeswoman for @entity206 @entity1 said : ' the company has failed to ensure the victims are suitably compensated so that women can draw a line under this distressing situation			2
' @entity212 , chief executive of the @entity213 , added : ' it 's deceptive and deceitful and it 's letting patients down			2
' a spokesman for @entity24 said : ' @entity24 has always put patient care at the heart of everything we do			0
' moral duty ' : @entity67 said the company could not afford to meet costs of removing and replacing implants ' the situation with @entity15 implants was n't of our making ; it arose as a result of a sophisticated fraud by the suppliers of these implants , perpetrated over a long period of time that went undetected by regulators for 12 consecutive years			2
' in response to this we have acted in the best interest of our patients and we will continue to do so			0
despite being a victim of this fraud , we were faced with liabilities arising from a class action we simply would n't have been able to survive			0
' that 's why we took the decision that it was in the best interest of our patients that we restructure our business , allowing us to continue to care for patients who have medical issues arising from @entity15 implants , and to continue the rest of our business as normal			1
' mother of three @entity252 , right , felt ' completely let down ' by @entity24 after she had @entity15 implants fitted in july 2009			0

let down : @entity252 , 36 , was part of the class action against @entity263 , which fitted her pip implants in 2009 she said : ' i got a letter this week saying @entity9 was going into administration			1
it said that was the end of my claim			0
i ’m angry and gutted			0
all those weeks of worry and additional surgery was an awful experience			0
for the rest of my life , i ’ll worry what it might have done to me			0
