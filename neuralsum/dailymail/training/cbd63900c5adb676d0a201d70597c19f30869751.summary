by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:32 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 01:28 est , 10 september 2013 @entity2 will today try to repair his battered relationship with union barons by insisting they are not ‘ the enemy within ’			1
the @entity8 leader , who owes his job to union voting power , will laud their 6.5million members as ‘ the people who make @entity13 what it is ’			1
but he will acknowledge that his party reforms could mean as few as one in ten union members who currently contribute to @entity8 coffers will do so in future			1
the changes will ensure members have to specifically opt in for their fees to go to the party			1
friends : @entity2 's @entity26 speech on tuesday will be centered around defending the @entity13 workers unions @entity30 leaders lambasted the plans at the weekend , saying mr @entity2 was a ‘ schoolboy ’ who lives in ‘ cloud cuckoo land ’			1
addressing the @entity26 conference in @entity35 today , mr @entity2 will launch a trenchant defence of trade unionism , rejecting @entity39 ’s famous description of parts of the movement as enemies			1
he will accuse @entity43 of devaluing millions of ordinary workers through his attacks on the unions			1
‘ we have a prime minister who writes you and your members off , ’ he is expected to say			2
‘ who does n’t just write you off , but oozes contempt for you from every pore			0
what does he say about you ? he says your members are a threat to our economy			2
back to the enemy within			0
‘ six and a half million people in @entity13			0
who teach our children , who look after the sick , who care for the elderly , who build our homes , who keep our shops open morning , noon and night			0
they ’re not the enemy within			0
they ’re the people who make @entity13 what it is			0
@entity65 : @entity67 business secretary @entity66 supports @entity2 's union reforms saying it is needed to take the ' big money out of politics ' ‘ how dare he ? how dare he insult people , members of trade unions , as he does ? how dare he write off whole sections of our society ? ‘ one nation conservatives , would be turning in their graves if they could hear the nasty , divisive , small - minded rhetoric of the leader of their once great party			1
' we know from recent experience what happens to political leaders who write off whole sections of a country			0
‘ that ’s what @entity90 did when he talked about the 47 per cent of people who would never vote for him			0
and look what happened to him			0
’ under the current system , union members automatically pay an annual fee of £ 3 to the @entity8 unless they specifically opt out – swelling party funds by millions of pounds a year			1
mr @entity2 has unveiled plans to force trade unionists to actively opt in to the funding of @entity8 , with the reward that they will become full party members			1
he will tell delegates he believes his changes could see his party ’s membership increase by 300,000 – a figure critics say will make him a hostage to fortune if it does not come about			2
but the target number is far fewer than the three million union members who currently contribute to @entity8 coffers because they have not opted out			1
@entity8 is likely to head off the threat of a huge loss of funds by charging those who opt in more than the current £ 3 a year			1
critics say the reforms could actually strengthen the unions , because it could see them hanging on to more money designed for political campaigning			1
mr @entity2 will say : ‘ it will be a massive challenge for the @entity8 to reach out to your members in a way that we have not done for many years and persuade them to be part of what we do			1
‘ and , like anything that is hard , it is a risk			0
but the bigger risk is just saying let ’s do it as we have always done it			0
’ @entity66 , who is @entity8 ’s business spokesman , said it was important to ‘ take the big money out of politics ’ even if it hit the party ’s finances			1
but backbencher @entity143 said @entity8 faced ruin and meltdown as a result of the ‘ ill thought through ’ reforms			1
yesterday @entity149 , general secretary of the powerful @entity151 union , called on mr @entity2 to be even stronger in his defence of union links			1
‘ trade unions have always been a force for good in our society , ’ he told a fringe event at the conference			2
instead of attacking , people should look to try and unite the nation			0
’ @entity162 celebrating the death in april of @entity39 are on sale at the @entity26 conference			1
bearing the legend ‘ @entity169 ’ , they are available alongside t - shirts and mugs with the slogan ‘ @entity172 are lower than @entity173 ’			2
conservative politicians said the merchandise highlighted the nasty side of the @entity177			0
@entity178 , mp for @entity179 , said : ‘ she said they could n’t forgive her because she won and they lost			0
’ unions and left - wing campaign groups are planning a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on @entity188 as part of their campaign against the government ’s austerity programme			2
yesterday @entity26 delegates approved the call for unions to co-ordinate a programme of strikes			1
the union - backed @entity197 had already organised a protest , which was planned to take place on november 5			2
however this is now set to be directly supported by the unions themselves			2
key workers – from nurses to firemen , teachers to postmen – could cause chaos if they decide to join the walkout			0
the plan raises the possibility of firemen and nurses striking on @entity188 night , a move which could force people to cancel parties due to health and safety fears			0
unions are legally allowed to ‘ co-ordinate ’ their strike action , or organise walkouts on the same day , as long as they have each successfully balloted their workforce on separate trade disputes			0
this is not the same as organising ‘ sympathy strikes ’ where workers walk out in support of other striking workers without having held a legal ballot			2
these were outlawed during the 1980s			0
yesterday @entity151 ’s executive director of policy @entity233 said he believes the ‘ yes ’ vote has committed the union to a policy of ‘ fighting back , industrially where possible ’			0
he added : ‘ but more than that , it commits us to organise a mass mobilisation			0
