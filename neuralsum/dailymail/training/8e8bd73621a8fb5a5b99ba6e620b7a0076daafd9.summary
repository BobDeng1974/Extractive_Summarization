waiting lists for potentially tests which can detect cancer have doubled in a year and are at a six year high , new figures show			1
crucial procedures such as colonoscopy - used to detect bowel and stomach cancers - and @entity10 and @entity11 scans used to find tumours , are supposed to be undertaken within six weeks of a gp referral			1
but the latest figures show in may this year alone more than 18,000 patients waited longer than that - more than double the number at this point last year			1
crucial procedures such as colonoscopy and @entity10 and ct scans are supposed to be undertaken within six weeks of a gp referral it is five times higher than the number of patients forced to wait longer than six weeks back in 2010			1
experts said the delays - which are partly blamed on rising number of patients and the ageing population - would alarm those potentially at risk			1
yesterday @entity31 , chief executive of the charity @entity32 , said the delays were ‘ unacceptable ’ given the huge risks of late diagnosis			0
he said : ‘ when cancers are diagnosed early they are treatable and outcomes improve significantly			0
with bowel cancer more than 90pc of people diagnosed at an early stage survive for at least five years compared to less than 7pc of those diagnosed at a late stage			0
‘ the period between being told you may have cancer and finding out whether you have or not is an extraordinarily worrying time for patients			2
to wait any time for a diagnosis is hard enough but to wait for more than 6 weeks is not something anyone should be expected to go through			1
' these waiting times must be improved in order to ensure that patients ’ health and well - being is paramount			2
’ the figures from @entity59 show 18,664 people waited longer than six weeks for diagnostic tests in may 2014 , compared with 6,899 in may 2013 , and 3,495 in may 2010			1
the figures from @entity59 show 18,664 people waited longer than six weeks for diagnostic tests these tests can detect life - threatening illnesses such as cancer and heart disease at an early stage and save lives			1
in just one month 3,870 patients waited over six weeks for tests for bowel and stomach cancers such as colonoscopy , cystoscopy – a telescope into the bladder - and gastroscopy , 1,611 waited too long for a ct scan , 6,839 for an ultrasound not related to pregnancy , up from just 1,181 last year , and 1,960 saw delays for an mri scan			1
@entity82 mp , @entity83 ’s @entity82 ( pls keep ) who unearthed the figures , said : ‘ patients are waiting longer for crucial tests – causing stress and real anguish for worried families			1
‘ last month , the @entity59 missed the cancer treatment target for the first time ever and these delays have clearly played a part in that			0
all the progress made on cancer care in the last decade is now at risk			0
’ @entity99 , of @entity100 , said it was ‘ alarming ’ that the proportion of people who face delays in receiving vital tests which can diagnose cancer has doubled since this time last year			2
he said : ‘ the @entity59 is under strain and cancer risks being overlooked and not given the focus it needs			0
each individual hospital has a responsibility to meet these targets , or they risk putting a patient ’s best chance of survival at risk			0
’ the @entity119 say only 2.3pc of people wait more than six weeks			2
the @entity59 is carrying out an extra 10,000 diagnostic tests a day – or 350,000 a month - compared with 2010			2
it is understood five trusts are responsible for 25pc of all the overlong waiting times – @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
a spokesperson said : ‘ we know parts of the @entity59 are under pressure because of unprecedented demand – the service is performing nearly 10,000 extra tests every day compared to 2009/10 , and there are recovery plans in place to deal with any local dips in performance			0
‘ we ’re also providing extra support for more operations , doctors , nurses and beds , and investing £ 750 million to support early diagnosis of cancer and better access to treatment			0
