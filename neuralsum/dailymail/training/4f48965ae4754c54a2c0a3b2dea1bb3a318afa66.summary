@entity1 ’s elite special forces have been ordered to soften their gruelling entry tests by the government ’s @entity4 watchdog			1
endurance exercises for those hoping to win places in the @entity9 and @entity10 have been made easier following a damning report by the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) into the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed during a 20 - mile march over the @entity15 last year			1
the move has sparked fury among officers and troops in the tough fighting units , who fear the calibre of soldiers winning places will decline , lives will be put at risk and the regiments ’ fearsome reputation will be undermined			1
test of endurance : the @entity9 has been ordered to soften their gruelling entry tests by the government 's @entity4 watchdog			1
above , soldiers take a breather on a 50 - mile march over the @entity15 last year victims : the changes follow a damning report by the @entity4 into the deaths of corporal @entity38 ( right ) , 31 , trooper @entity39 ( left ) , 31 , and lance corporal @entity40 , 24 , last july until now potential recruits would have to go without food if rations ran low and find streams if they ran out of water – skills @entity9 officers say are essential to survival in combat			1
candidates who had to be ‘ rescued ’ automatically failed			2
but new rules , to meet @entity4 demands , include providing extra rations , giving troops time to rest on marches , making sure safe drinking water is always available and introducing marshals to help stragglers cross the finishing line			1
tragic : the three soldiers , including @entity61 ( pictured ) , collapsed during a 20 - mile march over the @entity64 mountain range in the @entity15 , recruits are expected to march up and down the 2,900ft @entity66			1
instructors use two routes , the steep and inaccessible ‘ @entity69 ’ and the easier partly cobbled ‘ @entity70 ’			2
now , if candidates are struggling on the climb in adverse weather , they will use the ‘ @entity70 ’ to avoid any emergency arising			0
and in the jungle section of the two - venue test , held in @entity77 , if several recruits suffer heat exhaustion marches will be shortened or cancelled so they can recover and receive medical treatment			1
@entity9 sources say the pass rate has more than doubled since the changes were made in january ahead of the winter selection course			2
the @entity85 refused to confirm this			0
the @entity87 has been told that on the winter 2013 course , only 20 candidates out of 250 were successful			0
of the 250 who started the winter 2014 course , 46 passed			0
last night , an @entity9 source said : ‘ this caused a massive spike in the number of candidates completing the marches inside the time limits and thereby qualifying to serve in @entity9 units			1
‘ the @entity9 and @entity10 can not afford to accept candidates whose fitness , mental aptitude or military skills are in any doubt			0
the inspectors have no idea of the risks to soldiers ’ lives when they ’re in battle should training be compromised			2
‘ so even though the @entity9 and @entity10 have been struggling to fully staff their squadrons in recent years , there is no benefit to having a larger pool of guys as a result of the last course			0
question marks will remain over their capability			0
’ the @entity4 imposed the changes following the deaths of corporal @entity38 , 31 , trooper @entity39 , 31 , and lance corporal @entity40 , 24 , after an endurance march last july			1
tough : in the @entity15 ( pictured ) , recruits are expected to march up and down the 2,900ft @entity66			0
instructors use two routes , the steep and inaccessible ' @entity127 ' and the partly cobbled ' @entity70 ' the soldiers set off at around 6am carrying heavy packs up and down @entity66			2
as the temperature peaked in the early afternoon at @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , they ran out of water			2
@entity61 was declared dead on the mountain while @entity135 died that evening in hospital			0
@entity137 died two weeks later from multiple organ failure			0
it was the biggest loss of life in the history of @entity9 selection			0
afterwards , @entity4 inspector @entity143 launched an inquiry			1
in october , she sent a @entity145 , a document stating that the selection courses breached the @entity148			0
the notice casts blame on @entity9 instructors			0
scene : @entity9 sources say the pass rate has more than doubled since the changes were made in january ahead of the winter course			2
the @entity85 refused to confirm this			0
above , the @entity15 in @entity158 the inspector added that as the emergency unfolded , with at least six recruits showing signs of severe heat sickness , these instructors ‘ failed to review risk assessments ’			0
special forces chiefs were ordered by the @entity4 to present new risk control measures and to ensure that , in future , sufficient quantities of hot rations and safe drinking water would be available			1
the @entity4 confirmed last night that regulators had accepted new risk assessments and safety measures presented by the military			1
the @entity85 said : ‘ we have co-operated fully with the @entity4 inspectors and are implementing all the recommendations in the @entity145			1
’ a police inquiry into the deaths is continuing , with more than 100 instructors and soldiers being interviewed .			2

gruelling entry tests for @entity1 's elite special forces have been made easier
troops provided with extra water and food rations , and given time to rest
endurance marches will also be shorter - with marshals to help stragglers
follows report by @entity4 into deaths of three soldiers
