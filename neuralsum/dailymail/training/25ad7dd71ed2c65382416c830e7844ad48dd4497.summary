mr @entity240 told @entity246 's today programme : ' i think there are many areas of employment where , when you 've committed a crime like that , you are not allowed to be employed in that form of employment , and i think football is one of them , because you are a role model within a community			0
' i know this is sad for @entity0 , who 's been to prison and paid a price , but i think that in these circumstances it 's not appropriate to have someone with that record in a profession where you are idolised by young people			2
