@entity1 will be plunged into a deeper economic crisis than the 2008 crash if it breaks away from the @entity4 , @entity0 warned			1
the @entity6 treasury minister said the devastating financial collapse which took @entity8 to the brink would be ' dwarfed ' by the impact of independence			1
it came amid claims @entity1 will lose its £ 300million - a - year share of the @entity4 's @entity16 rebate if it votes for separation			1
@entity6 treasury minister @entity0 warned the 2008 economic crash would be ' dwarfed ' by the impact of independence with barely 50 days to go until @entity1 have their say in the independence referendum , warnings about the economic impact have escalated			1
mr @entity0 , the chief secretary to the treasury , said @entity1 would face a devastating combination of falling @entity26 oil revenues and an ageing population which would imperil the economy			2
he told @entity29 : ' if you 're a @entity31 and you 're worried about public expenditure and austerity , if you vote for independence you ai n't seen nothing yet			0
' the financial pressures that an independent @entity37 would face would dwarf what i 've had to do in the last four years			0
' it follows a similar warning earlier his month from former @entity44 chancellor @entity43 who said the risks of @entity1 going it alone ‘ are colossal ’ and there will be no going back			2
mr @entity43 , who was chancellor in the @entity44 government when the banking crisis hit in 2008 , said the ramifications of independence would be even greater			0
first minister @entity52 is under growing pressure with barely 50 days to go until the independence referendum the @entity4 taxpayer spent £ 66billion bailing out failing banks , including @entity8 and @entity57			1
‘ being told the world 's largest bank has three hours before it collapses does provide a shock to the system , ’ mr @entity43 told @entity58			0
‘ but the decision on @entity1 is forever			2
it 's irrevocable , irreversible			0
if we get it wrong , it will have a profound effect , not just on @entity1 , but the rest of the @entity4			1
the stakes in the banking crisis were big ; this is so much bigger			0
’ the economic challenge an independent @entity37 would face were laid bare with a fresh warning about its £ 300million - a - year share of the @entity16 rebate			1
professor @entity75 of the @entity76 in @entity77 said @entity52 has no right to the @entity4 's hard - won windfall			1
the first minister had claimed the rest of the @entity4 and a newly separate @entity1 would share the rebate in the event of independence			1
but professor @entity75 has become the latest expert to dismiss the idea			0
' there is no right to a rebate			0
it is just something the @entity4 has negotiated , ' he said			2
@entity93 has warned that losing the rebate would cost the @entity95 £ 20billion over seven years			0
an independent @entity1 may also have to contribute to the money the @entity4 gets back , which would cost £ 540million , also over seven years			1
that would be a major blow to @entity1 's finances , with the country £ 12billion in the red last year - a proportionately higher deficit than the rest of the @entity4			1
despite this , the @entity103 has promised to continue high public spending , which finance secretary @entity106 plans to bankroll with £ 3.6billion of borrowing over two years			0
there was at least some good news for mr @entity52 , as professor @entity75 predicted @entity1 would be allowed to rejoin the @entity16 if there was a @entity111 vote			1
he admitted other member states - any one of which could block an independent @entity1 - were concerned about a domino effect among separatist regions of their own countries			2
but he expects them to admit @entity1 - then close the door to those who try to follow			2
former chancellor @entity43 has warned the risks of independence are ' bigger ' than the banking crash professor @entity75 said : ' @entity1 has a very good position because it is the first one in the line			2
but there is real fear of a domino effect across @entity130 , and not just in @entity133 's @entity132 or @entity131			0
' there are other member states which fear @entity1 independence might trigger claims in their own territories			1
@entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , for example , have minorities			0
' after @entity1 , you may expect moves to prevent other member states splitting apart			2
even if @entity1 gains recognition and becomes a member state , other countries will want to close this option			2
' a @entity95 spokesman said : ' @entity1 has a huge amount to offer the @entity16 , including almost 60 per cent of its oil reserves and around a quarter of @entity130 's wave and offshore wind energy potential , which is why we will be in a very strong negotiating position - and why it will be in other countries ' interests for @entity1 to continue in membership			1
' the current @entity16 budget has been agreed until 2020 and prior to then @entity1 's share of the @entity4 rebate will be a matter for negotiation between the @entity1 and @entity4 governments			1
for subsequent budget rounds , an independent @entity1 will be in a position to negotiate the best deal for @entity1			0
' a beleaguered @entity52 is failing to convince @entity1 on separation as the country approaches the last 50 days of campaigning before the referendum , a major study shows			1
the @entity176 ( @entity177 ) of about 6,000 @entity1 - a far higher number than other polls - shows 51 per cent plan to vote no. the @entity111 campaign is winning over more undecided voters , but not enough to close the gap			1
the @entity177 also becomes the latest observer to say that mr @entity52 's failure to deliver a credible economic case for separation - with no answers on currency and start - up costs - will cost him			0
it says the economy is the biggest issue among undecided voters considering a @entity111 ballot			0
according to @entity177 , 51 per cent of @entity1 plan to vote no , 39 per cent yes , and 10 per cent remain undecided			0
the @entity177 asked 5,896 people how they intended to vote in february and march , and another 6,182 in may and june			0
the results show some undecided drifting towards @entity111 , but not in high enough numbers			0
the @entity199 group said it was another encouraging survey showing most @entity1 want to stay in the @entity4			1
but @entity201 , chief executive of @entity37 , said : ' @entity202 is solid and as we move into the final eight weeks of the campaign we will be working hard to continue the flow of undecided voters to our side			0
