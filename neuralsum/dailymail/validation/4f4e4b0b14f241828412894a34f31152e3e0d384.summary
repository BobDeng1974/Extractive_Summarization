her profile is one of the most famous in the world and is seen every day on coins , stamps and bank notes , but now , the @entity7 is to get a new look			1
a new coin portrait of her majesty has been unveiled by the @entity11 and will be used on currency from this year			1
the effigy , which was designed by engraver @entity14 , is only the fifth official coin portrait made during the @entity7 's 63 - year reign and replaces the current one , which first appeared in 1998			1
commissioned in 1820 by @entity26 , the diadem , which is most often seen during the @entity37 , has 1,333 diamonds and 169 pearls , arranged in rose , thistle and shamrock designs to represent @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
like its owner , the diadem also has a long history of appearing on coins and bank notes , having appeared on currency belonging to the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity51 @entity55 territories among many others			2
the new portrait was chosen from a selection of anonymously submitted designs , with creator @entity14 becoming , at 34 , the youngest engraver ever to create a royal coin portrait			1
likeness : the new portrait is an updated version of the @entity63 design , created in 1997 creator : 34 - year - old engraver @entity65 , from the @entity64 , created the winning design new look : the new coin portrait is only the fifth to be produced during the @entity7 's reign , with the first in 1953 ' i really liked the four previous coin portraits - each one is strong in its own way , ' says a delighted mr @entity14			1
' i hope that i ’ve done @entity79 justice and captured her as i intended			0
' the news that my design had been chosen was quite overwhelming , and i still ca n’t quite believe that my royal portrait will be featured on millions of coins			0
' speaking about the decision to award mr @entity14 the job , @entity85 , director of the @entity86 , said the judging panel ’s decision was ' pretty unanimous '			0
mr @entity14 , who is originally from the @entity64 , says his family are ' really proud ' , adding : ' they ’ve had to keep quiet about this			0
' it ’s going to be hard to top this			0
it ’s going to take a while to sink in			0
i ’m really happy with how it ’s turned out			0
i can only hope everyone appreciates it			0
' the first coin portrait of the @entity7 's reign appeared in 1953 , shortly after she took the throne , and was designed by @entity104			1
heading for your wallet : the new coin will be introduced this year although the four subsequent designs show her wearing a crown , her first portrait showed a fresh - faced young queen wearing nothing more than an evergreen wreath			2
that all changed when a new coin portrait entered circulation in april 1968 , which showed a sterner version of the @entity7 in the @entity26 diadem			1
the image , which was designed by @entity122 , was replicated on stamps and remains one of the most famous portraits of the @entity7 ever created			2
in 1985 came another new coin portrait , this time by @entity127 who once again showed the monarch in the @entity26 diadem			1
unusually , the new portrait proved controversial with @entity127 accused of making the effigy ' flatteringly youthful '			0
unimpressed , he swiftly hit back at critics , telling them his intention had been to create something ' regal and ageless '			0
for the fourth coin portrait of the @entity7 , which replaced @entity127 's design in 1997 , @entity79 chose to wear the magnificent girls of @entity140 tiara			1
the gem , which was made for @entity142 on the occasion of her wedding in 1893 , is one of the most spectacular in the @entity146 and features 13 brilliant - cut diamonds as its centrepiece			0
along with its appearance on the 1997 coins , it was also worn by the @entity7 to marry the @entity153 in november 1947			2
in charge : @entity11 chief executive @entity11 in front of the five royal coin portraits famous : the 1968 portrait on the left is used on all stamps while the one on the right was introduced in 1997			2
