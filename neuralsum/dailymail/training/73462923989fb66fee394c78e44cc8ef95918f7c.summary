by @entity0 there ’s nothing worse than getting a headless pint of beer at the pub. no one wants to be forced to consume a beverage that ’s best served with a head of foam			1
but one company has the solution – they ’ve crafted a device that will artificially give your beer the topping it needs for the ultimate refreshment			0
the @entity16 can give your beer a head at the touch of a button called the @entity16 , the device uses ultrasonic waves to create a head on any beer			1
it uses six aa batteries which , according to manufacturer @entity27 ’s website , can provide you with ‘ 3,000 foams			1
’ they promise their beer rescuer , available for $ 34.99 ( £ 20.89 ; € 25.37 ) , ‘ will not flatten the beer			0
’ it is believed man first learned to make a basic gruel from barley			0
then natural yeast , perhaps supplied by insects , would have fermented the gruel and created a basic type of beer			0
beer was actually easier to make than bread			0
after discovering this , humans would have started cultivating grain , settling to tend the crop			0
when a button is pressed , vibrations are produced at the bottom of the device			0
this creates waves that evenly open up the beer as they travel through it			1
the uniform bubbles then create a head of foam when they reach the surface			1
this also releases the beer 's aromas			2
but @entity27 warn you should ‘ remember to leave room for the head or you ’ll be mopping			1
’ nonetheless , beer lovers everywhere will surely delight at being able to enjoy their drink as intended whenever they want			2
before and after : @entity27 say one set of batteries can provide 3,000 foams			2

@entity27 's @entity16 can create a head on any beer
at the touch of a button ultrasonic waves travel up the *liquid*
they create foam without making the drink go flat
