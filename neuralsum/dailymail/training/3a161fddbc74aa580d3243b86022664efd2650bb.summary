by @entity0 ineffective : researchers have said that crash dieting does not work because it destroys muscle rather than fat it ’s a disheartening cycle that crash dieters know only too well			2
you cut down on calories , the pounds rapidly fall off and you are finally the size you want to be			2
but as soon as you go back to normal , all that weight piles back on again – often with a little bit more			1
but now scientists have got to grips with why crash dieters struggle to keep the pounds off long - term			2
research shows that rapid weight loss leads to much more muscle being lost than slow , steady slimming			1
muscle is better at burning off calories than fat which means that if you have less muscle , less energy will be used and so the weight will begin to creep up again			2
the theory , discussed yesterday at the @entity25 on @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , is based on evidence from @entity31 researchers – who put one group of people on a very low calorie diet for five weeks and another group on a less strict diet for 12 weeks			1
the eating plans were designed so that both groups lost the same amount of weight – just over different timescales			1
the scientists measured the volunteers ’ free fat mass – all the tissue in the body apart from fat – at the start and at the end of the diet			0
this is a way of measuring how much muscle is lost , as other parts of the body - organs , blood and bones - are not affected by dieting			0
both groups lost similar amounts of weight – but those on the very low calorie diet lost much more muscle			1
even a month after coming off their diet , they had lost almost three times as much muscle as those who had lost weight more slowly			0
it is normal to burn off some muscle on a diet , because as you get lighter you do not need as much muscle mass to move around			0
but it is thought that on a crash diet , the body is forced to break down extra muscle to create the protein and sugar that is missing from meals			0
shot - term : the study said highly restrictive diets , such as those centred on cabbage soup , lead to particularly rapid muscle loss lead study author , @entity86 researcher professor @entity85 , is now tracking the two groups for nine months to see if the crash dieters regain more weight than the slow dieters			1
however , she suspects this will be the case			0
she said : ‘ it is not so much reaching a certain weight loss that ’s difficult , it is maintaining that weight loss over a period of time that is the real challenge			1
’ professor @entity100 , president - elect of the @entity101 for the @entity102 , warned that highly - restrictive diets , such as those in which people eat cabbage soup and little else , are usually so low in protein that the body has no option but to generate its own protein by breaking down muscle			0
as a result , crash dieters can lose 50 per cent of their strength within just a fortnight			0
this can leave them feeling so weak that they feast on the foods they have denied themselves – and they rapidly put on weight			1
the experts also discussed other reasons why crash dieting does not work in the long term			0
they included the idea that most of the ‘ weight ’ that is lost is water which is replaced on eating normally ; and fast slimmers do n’t learn how to eat healthily day in , day out , so as they return to normal , unhealthy diets they simply start gaining weight again .			2

theory was *unveiled* at @entity131 @entity132 in @entity27 , @entity28
@entity31 researchers put two groups on diets designed for equal weight loss
one group spent 12 weeks losing the weight , while another just took five
the rapid losers are thought to pile the pounds back more quickly
