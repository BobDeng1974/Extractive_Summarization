by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:37 est , 26 february 2014 saggy , wrinkly knees are , along with translucent , aged hands , are one of the biggest indicators of age , and one that even a-listers such as super-fit @entity10 and @entity11 fall prey to			0
now a new procedure aims to turn back the march of time by firming up sagging skin and reducing fat , all in the space of your lunch hour			0
while previously the only sure - fire way to lift skin that had lost its elasticity was through surgery , which can be both painful and expensive , the new ‘ knee raiser ’ treatment aims to offer similar results using a combination of infrared light and vacuum therapy			1
even super-fit stars such a @entity11 , 51 , right , and @entity10 , 44 , left , ca n't avoid kninkles the non-surgical procedure uses a combination of the infrared light , vacuum and bi-polar radio frequency to cause deep heating of the fat cells and the surrounding connective and underlying collagen fibres			1
this is designed to increase circulation , lymphatic drainage , cellular metabolism , resulting in skin firmness and a lifting effect			1
one of the major plus points of the @entity49 procedure is that it usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half , and requires little to no down time , meaning you could even fit it into a long lunch break			1
no matter how healthy a person , the natural progression of time takes a toll on the appearance of the legs , with older knees ( right ) tending to have less elasticity than younger legs ( left ) some surgeons say the only sure - fire way to lift skin that has lost its elasticity is through surgery , which can be both painful and expensive and unlike many other non-surgical procedures that promise results with no negatives , the @entity49 technique , which is available in clinics across the @entity71 , has been favourably studied in peer reviewed medical journals			1
however , at £ 350 a treatment , with up to three treatments needed to banish severe sagging , this method of correction is not kind on the wallet			1
additionally many plastic surgeons have reservations as to its efficacy			1
speaking to the @entity87 , plastic surgeon and @entity90 member @entity89 warns that the costly treatment may leave people expecting the same results as surgery but failing to deliver			2
' if you want change your knees altered , liposuction can be quite effective and removing pockets of fat around them , and on very rare occasions , where there is a large amount of baggy skin , a skin excision can be performed to lift it			0
' with these sort of treatments people should n't expect too much , and they should n't be saving up for this for this kind of procedure			0
' respected plastic surgeon professor @entity114 says : ' the @entity49 is a great machine for temporary skin tightening and smoothing but there is no evidence that i am aware of that it produces effects equivalent to surgical skin excision and lifting			2
' nor is it permanent			0
it is an expensive treatment that has to be repeated six times and is best combined with weight loss and exercise			2
sadly the reality is never as convincing as the hype			0
' realistic expectations on the patient 's part will produce a happy client			0
unrealistic claims will end in disappointment			0
