if you 're a little squeamish you may not want to watch the video accompanying this column			0
it features the most persistently savage treatment i have ever seen a footballer receive on a pitch			2
you may hear more of the name @entity9 in the future , but only sheer luck has allowed him to get a move into the @entity13 and a step up to @entity16 level as he chases his dream of making it in the professional game			1
@entity9 has joined @entity16 @entity20 on loan from @entity23 side @entity22 @entity9 ( no 8 ) goes in for a tackle with @entity26 's @entity25 at @entity27 @entity28 international @entity25 goes studs - up on the talented 22 - year - old but does n't get booked the 22 - year - old technically gifted talent was rejected by @entity32 and has had to make his way through non-league football to earn another shot at the big time			1
on monday he made a loan switch from @entity38 to @entity16 @entity20 , with the deal set to be made permanent when the transfer window opens in january			1
he 's a lucky boy – not because he 's getting a shot in the @entity13 , his performances have earned him that chance with 45 goals in 130 conference games from midfield			1
he 's lucky because he was sliced to pieces by brutal , @entity49 players in saturday 's @entity23 game , which @entity38 won 2 - 1 against @entity26			1
when you see the succession of vicious challenges aimed at @entity9 you wonder how he survived without breaking any limbs			1
in almost 40 years of watching football at all levels of the game i have never seen a player receive such horrendous treatment			0
maybe i am naive , but i did n't think this sort of nasty thuggery still happened on the pitch			0
@entity9 , pictured in his post-match interview , was fortunate to finish the game without a serious injury @entity26 's @entity69 ( second from right ) launches himself at @entity9 by the corner flag @entity69 misses the ball and smashes into the @entity38 midfielder during the second half @entity9 , who has now joined @entity20 on loan , is sent flying by @entity69 ' challenge @entity77 5 @entity25 , who was eventually red carded for stamping on @entity9 , actually played for @entity28 – the @entity79 international side - last month in @entity80			1
will the @entity81 do anything about his behaviour ? he committed most of the fouls shown in the video , which was put together by www.footballcameraman.uk			0
@entity25 's main aim is clearly to take @entity9 out , he has very little interest in the ball			1
it 's disgusting to watch			2
the first one sees @entity25 's studs aimed at @entity9 's knees			1
incredibly the referee did n't even give him a yellow card			0
the foul by the corner flag – the third foul on the video - is sickening			2
a delicious piece of skill sees @entity9 , flying down the right wing , drag the ball back while at full pace			1
but the defender , @entity69 , is already sliding in and recklessly takes out @entity9 's standing leg			1
it 's amazing he does n't break his leg			2
@entity69 , who was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend three years ago - hours after being sent off in an @entity109 tie for violent conduct - appears to lean over the victim as he lies on the ground and say something to him			0
it 's clearly not a question about whether he is feeling ok			0
@entity9 is wrestled to the turf in another exchange with @entity26 midfielder @entity25 @entity25 earned a deserved red card after stamping out at talented 22 - year - old @entity9 @entity69 tweeted after the game that he thought it was a fair challenge , and he defended his view by pointing out that the referee did n't even award a free - kick			1
but for me @entity69 has no control over his body as he flies full force into @entity9			1
he shows no care towards his fellow player			0
i think it 's a horrible challenge , a potential leg - breaker , and the referee got it badly wrong			2
but you take a look and decide			0
@entity137 ends up being booked by clueless referee @entity138 for having his own shirt pulled			0
i can not believe this happened this weekend in the fifth tier of @entity143 football			0
@entity144 , the referee , and in particular @entity26 's @entity28 international @entity25 should all face consequences for what happened to @entity9			1
good luck to him in his career , if there is any football justice , his skills will be rewarded with success , not injuries			0
as for @entity26 , shame on the @entity155			2
they were called ' brave ' after their narrow @entity109 defeat to @entity158 earlier this month			0
i only saw cowards in @entity161 shirts at @entity38 at the weekend			2

@entity9 came under attack in @entity38 's win against @entity26
the 22 - year - old was persistently fouled and was lucky not to get injured
the talented midfielder has now joined @entity20 on loan
some of @entity26 's players should be *ashamed* of themselves
