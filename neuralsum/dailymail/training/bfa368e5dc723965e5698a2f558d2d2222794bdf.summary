@entity101 spokesman @entity100 insists the rig , owned by @entity1 state - run oil company @entity103 , is in @entity1 's territorial waters and therefore drilling is ' normal and legal			1

' @entity1 seems intent on putting down its footprint squarely in contested waters and force @entity14 's hand , ' he said			1
' it appears a critical juncture has occurred and one would expect @entity14 to be weighing its options			0
' @entity14 's back is against the wall , though @entity1 's policies - which according to virtually everyone except @entity1 are baseless legally - have brought about this situation			2
' @entity1 occupied the @entity164 40 years ago , and 74 soldiers from the then @entity124 - backed @entity166 died trying to take them back			0
