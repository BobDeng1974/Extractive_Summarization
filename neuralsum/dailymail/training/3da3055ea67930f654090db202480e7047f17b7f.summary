the next two or three , i feel these could be the best years of my career			2
' i 'm at a stage , especially after playing at this club for 10 yeas , where i 've picked up a lot about the game			2
' i now know exactly what i want to do on the pitch and i 'm fit and ready to do it			0
' @entity0 insists he has matured as both a man and a footballer , leading to his appointment as captain for both @entity8 and @entity9 this season , but he showed both sides of the coin in saturday 's match with @entity16			1
after scoring a delightful goal to set @entity8 on their way to a 2 - 1 victory at @entity60 , he let himself down with a petulant kick on @entity28 and earned a straight red card			1
it is a decade since @entity0 arrived at @entity60 as an 18 - year - old and announced himself with a hat - trick on debut against @entity67 in the @entity68 @entity0 has lifted the @entity70 title six times during his decade at @entity60 @entity0 celebrates after @entity8 beat @entity73 on penalties to lift the @entity68 in 2008 @entity0 lifts the @entity75 after @entity8 defeated @entity76 in the 2010 final at @entity78 1			1

@entity82 40 ( 89 ) @entity0 's goal against @entity16 took him to 218 in a @entity8 shirt and he is in striking distance of @entity31 ( 237 ) and @entity29 ( 249 ) at the top of the club 's all - time list			1
@entity0 also needs another nine goals to overtake @entity91 as @entity9 's all - time leading scorer and could well achieve it before the next @entity93			1
but while it would be preferable to play in a forward position in order to chase down these records , @entity0 acknowledges that his future may eventually lay in midfield			1
he said : ' [ @entity102 ] goes into so much detail about the opposition and there 'll be times i 'll be needed to play deeper or wider , which i 've no problem doing			2
@entity0 knows that @entity8 manager @entity102 may want him to play in midfield in the future ' but in the main i feel i 've still got at least two or three years up front			1
i know i 've got the qualities to play in midfield			0
i 've done it comfortably			0
' there 'll come a time when i move to a deeper position for good and that could be this week , it could be in a couple of years			0
it 's down to the manager and i 'll accept it			0
