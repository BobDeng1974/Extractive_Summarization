for many people , heartbreak can lead to drowning your sorrows in comfort food and piling on the pounds			2
but when @entity6 split up with her husband she decided it was time for a positive change			1
the 31 - year - old from @entity11 , @entity12 - who claims her unhappy marriage transformed her from a contented size 12 into a frumpy size 20 - embraced life as a single girl , losing seven stone in just one year ... and dropping to a slender size six			1
now that @entity6 has lost all the weight and is a size six she is enjoying life as a confident single girl , and believes the reason she was fat was because she was married she says : ' it was like i woke up one morning after i had been married a couple of years and suddenly realised that the old me was gone			1
this big , fat , miserable person was left in her place ' the senior credit controller said : ' being a wife made me fat - but being single made me sexy again			1
i was always happy with my figure until i got married			1
' after the wedding , my life totally changed			1
but when i left my husband , i did n't even have to try to diet			2
incredibly , the weight just fell off because i was single again			1
i wo n't get married again in a hurry - it made me fat			2
' @entity6 was a size 10 when she met her market trader husband - who does not wish to be names - in a nightclub at the age of 23 , and in true whirlwind romance style the couple moved in together just weeks later and married the following year in 2006			1
@entity6 walked down the aisle in a size 12 dress weighing 9 stone , but after settling into married life her figure dramatically changed			1
@entity6 was a size 10 when she met her market trader husband in a nightclub at the age of 23 , but her weight quickly ballooned because she was miserable as a wife she says : ' i wanted to show my husband i was trying to lose weight and look sexy again			1
but in secret , i was still eating pizza and chocolate when he was out because i was so bored and lonely ' she says : ' it was like i woke up one morning after i had been married a couple of years and suddenly realised that the old me was gone			1
this big , fat , miserable person was left in her place			2
' at first i just did n't understand why			2
i had n't had any children and i did n't have any major issues with food			2
but it was when i sat and thought about how much my life had changed that i realised why i was fat			0
' i 'd gone from being an independent , fun - loving girl who enjoyed partying to staying in all the time , watching tv and eating takeaways			2
life revolved around sitting on the sofa and deciding what to eat for dinner			0
' @entity6 as a healthy size 12 on her wedding day , before she began eating out of ' boredom ' during her marriage @entity6 said married life made it impossible to diet : ' before our wedding , i found it easy to lose a few pounds			1
i would just skip a few meals and the weight would drop off me			2
' but as a married woman , i had my husband to think about			1
i could n't simply not cook a meal - sitting down to eat was pretty much the only thing we did together			0
' fearing her marriage was already in trouble , @entity6 felt prioritising her diet would only cause more problems			1
she says : ' the only thing we really looked forward to was a bottle of wine , a movie and takeaway at the weekend			0
' i was worried that if i gave that up , we would have no connection at all so it was easier to push the upset about my weight aside and carry on as normal			2
' @entity110 was the glue keeping us together because we both loved our takeaways			0
it became my comfort - my way to get through the boredom			2
' as the cracks in her marriage grew , @entity6 turned to food even more			1
she regularly treated herself to family - sized pizzas and garlic bread to forget about her unhappiness			0
@entity6 admits : ' neither of us wanted to say the marriage was n't working			1
it was easier to buy a slab of chocolate and get stuck in to that than face the truth			0
' but the bigger @entity6 got , the worse her relationship became			1
she says : ' i was sure my husband did n't find me attractive any more so i avoided being physical			2
' i started dressing in baggy , frumpy clothes and felt like an old , middle - aged woman			0
' when she reached 15st , @entity6 joined a slimming club in a last - ditch attempt to shift the pounds			1
she says : ' i wanted to show my husband i was trying to lose weight and look sexy again			1
but in secret , i was still eating pizza and chocolate when he was out because i was so bored and lonely			2
' i was nothing like the woman i had been before - it seemed impossible to get below a size 20			1
' fearing the old @entity6 was gone for ever , she joined a gym and started working out four times a week			1
but because her marriage was still failing , she regularly turned to junk food to soften the pain			2
she says : ' i was just going round in circles			0
i knew i desperately wanted life to change but was n't sure how to make it happen			0
' @entity6 had been married for six years when the turning point came in january last year			1
breakfast : two bacon and egg @entity158			0
lunch : leftover takeaway or @entity165 foot - long roll			0
dinner : takeaway or a large home - cooked meal of pasta or jacket potato			0
snacks : chocolates , crisps and dips			0

@entity6 admits : ' neither of us wanted to say the marriage was n't working			1
it was easier to buy a slab of chocolate and get stuck in to that than face the truth ' @entity6 made the effort to reconnect with her old friends and soon found that a busy social life had a dramatic impact on her diet : ' because i had things to do , i would just grab something healthy to eat on the way ' she explains : ' it was a typical night			1
i had just got in from work and my husband had got up after a night shift and headed straight out the door			2
' we barely looked at each other			0
i was home alone not knowing when he would be back and i had two choices - i could either open the fridge and start scoffing or pack a bag and leave			0
' she chose the latter			0
she says : ' i called a friend who agreed i could stay with her			0
then i packed as much stuff as i could and called a taxi			0
i was scared but also relieved because i knew nothing would change otherwise			0
to me , our marriage had already been over for a long time			2
' @entity6 made the effort to reconnect with her old friends and soon found that a busy social life had a dramatic impact on her diet			1
she says : ' because i had things to do , i would just grab something healthy to eat on the way , like a sandwich or a wrap			0
food was no longer the only focus of my life			0
' after just a few weeks of single life , @entity6 was surprised to notice her clothes getting looser			1
she says : ' it was crazy			0
i 'd not gone back to the slimming club or gym since leaving my husband but for the first time in years , i was actually losing weight			1
' when people started noticing her weight loss , @entity6 would say it was because she had gone from being married to single			1
