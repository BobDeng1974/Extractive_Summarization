@entity0 changed his story following the immediate aftermath of the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen @entity4 to include events about which he initially denied all knowledge			1
evidence presented to the grand jury and reviewed by @entity9 has revealed a crucial difference between the officer 's first account of events given to his squad supervisor on the scene and his second statement to @entity18 detectives investigating the shooting			1
in @entity0 's now very public account of his encounter with @entity4 and @entity22 on august 9 he has claimed that he asked @entity23 and @entity0 to move to the sidewalk rather than walk in the street			1
when they walked on , @entity0 has repeatedly stated , he realized they matched the description of two suspects wanted in connection with the robbery of nearby @entity33			1
a youth matching @entity23 's description had stolen a box of @entity38 cigarillos			2
but the sworn testimony of @entity0 's squad supervisor directly contradicts this account			1
@entity0 's supervisor was the first officer to speak with the 28 - year - old cop following the shooting			1
the men spoke before @entity64 had even been notified of the incident and before the medical examiner or investigating officers had arrived on the scene			0
at that time , the supervisor said : ' he [ @entity0 ] did not know anything about the stealing call			1
' when pressed by the attorney questioning him , the officer reiterated that @entity0 , ' did not know anything '			2
asked , ' he told you he did n't know about there being a stealing at @entity77 ? ' the officer responded , ' @entity79			0
' nor did he make any mention of reversing his police car back towards the youths			0
in fact the squad supervisor stated that , in several subsequent conversations , @entity0 said ' he did not have that call			1
' yet two hours after speaking to his supervisor , 28 - year - old @entity0 gave a very different account to the @entity64 detective assigned to conduct a cursory interview with the cop			2
in his testimony the @entity18 detective , whose name has been redacted in the transcripts that are among the thousands of pages of grand jury evidence made publicly available by prosecutor @entity98 , recalled : ' he tells me he was leaving an unrelated sick case call and was driving , it would be west on @entity102			1
' as he 's driving he hears a call that was not assigned to him for a stealing in progress at 9101 @entity106 and he provides us with that address and the nature of the call was a stealing			0
' he said that the call comments indicated the suspect description was a black male wearing a black shirt and brown shorts , and that an additional call comment indicated that taken during the stealing were @entity118			0
' it is a marked discrepancy from @entity0 's admission minutes after the shooting that he had no knowledge of that incident			1
in the time between that denial and this detailed recollection of the suspect 's description and goods stolen , @entity0 had driven himself back to @entity129 on the city 's @entity130			2
he had washed his hands clean of any blood and he had been permitted to bag up his own gun as evidence - acts entirely contrary to @entity18 procedure			2
and in the course of an hour , he had spent time in the company of the lieutenant colonel , his chief of police @entity46 , as well as an attorney from the @entity143			0
looters robbed @entity42 businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict @entity0 , which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue latest protests : student activists at @entity161 in @entity18 yesterday as a nationwide debate about race and policing continues to boil @entity0 was sitting with all three when the @entity18 detective arrived to interview him			1
before he could , @entity0 's lieutenant colonel made the decision to take the officer to hospital for treatment			2
medical records show that what @entity0 described as a struggle for his life left scant physical injury			0
@entity0 was diagnosed with bruising and given medication described by his treating physician as ' essentially prescription strength @entity179			0
' it is now also known that the decision to x-ray @entity0 was not a clinical one made by his medic but in response to the chief of police 's direct request			0
what he told his squad supervisor ' he [ @entity0 ] did not know anything about the stealing call			1
' what he told @entity194 detective ' as he 's driving he hears a call that was not assigned to him for a stealing in progress at 9101 @entity106 and he provides us with that address and the nature of the call was a stealing			0
' what he told the @entity204 ' he heard over the radio a call for a stealing in progress … he heard it was at a market , he did n't hear which one and he heard a description over the radio saying the subjects were walking towards the @entity215 , stole @entity216 and one subject was wearing a black shirt ' what he told grand jury ' when i start looking at @entity23 , first thing i notice is his right hand , his right hand is full of @entity216			1
and that 's when it clicker for me because i now saw the @entity228 , i looked in my mirror , i did a double check that @entity22 was wearing a black shirt , these are the two from the stealing			0
' it was chief @entity46 who released @entity236 footage of the @entity77 robbery showing @entity23 swiping the cigarillos and squaring up to a clearly intimidated store keeper			2
his actions drew harsh criticism from those who saw it as an attempt to smear @entity23 and shift focus from @entity0			2
chief @entity46 's claim that he released the tapes in response to media requests was subsequently shown to be untrue			0
in his interview with the @entity18 detective @entity0 recalled @entity23 handing something to @entity22 and saying something like , ' here take these			1
' but he said he could not see what was handed			0
by the time officer @entity0 gave his account to the @entity204 agent assigned to interview him on 28 august his power of recall had grown ever more impressive			2
the federal agent told the @entity260 that @entity0 stated , ' he heard over the radio a call for a stealing in progress … he heard it was at a market , he did n't hear which one and he heard a description over the radio saying the subjects were walking towards the @entity215 , stole @entity216 and one subject was wearing a black shirt			1
' officer @entity0 's attention was then drawn to @entity4 and he noticed that @entity4 's hands were full of @entity216			1
he looks in his rear view mirror and also saw that @entity22 was wearing a black t - shirt			0
' crucially , the @entity204 agent continued , ' thinking back on the call , @entity4 was wearing a gray t - shirt and the call was they stole @entity216 and one was wearing a black shirt			0
' so kind of putting tow and two together or thinking that these might be the two guys , he puts the car in to reverse			0
' @entity0 got out of the car to give chase following the struggle for his gun that saw the first shot fired , because , the agent stated , ' @entity4 was a fleeing felon			1
and he was just doing his job , those were his words			0
' none of the interviews - not the first account given to his @entity296 , or the cursory interview conducted within hours of the shooting by the @entity18 detective or the @entity204 's own interrogation - were recorded			0
asked why he had not recorded nor noted down @entity0 's vital first account , his squad supervisor said , ' number one , i did not have a recorder			1
number two , i did n't take notes because at that point in time i had multiple things going through my mind besides what @entity0 was telling me			0
' @entity0 who resigned without severance this week has never filled out an incident report , nor has he written a ' use of force ' report or been asked to provide a formal statement to anyone other than his attorney .			2

@entity0 told the first officer to question him on the death that he did not know about a radio call about two teenagers being wanted for robbery
but he later told @entity18 detectives that he had matched @entity4 to the description of wanted suspects
he also did not initially reveal that he backed up his car towards @entity4 and his friend , which he said subsequently
grand jury evidence from his squad supervisor who was first to ask him about shooting discloses discrepancy
@entity0 has now resigned from force but *controversy* over death of @entity23 still rages
