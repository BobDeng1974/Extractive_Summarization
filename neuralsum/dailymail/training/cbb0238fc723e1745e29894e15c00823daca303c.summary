this fully - functioning house is made entirely from recycled materials - including 20,000 toothbrushes which are used to fill cavities in the walls - instead of teeth			1
the recycled home is cleverly constructed using compressed plastic bags , discarded carpet tiles , dvd cases , video tapes , old jeans and other waste offcuts by students from @entity14			1

the house is open for the public to view			2
