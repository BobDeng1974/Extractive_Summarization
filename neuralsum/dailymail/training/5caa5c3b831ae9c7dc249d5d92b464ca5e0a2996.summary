prime minister @entity0 says the process of bringing home the @entity4 victims of @entity5 has started in @entity6 the first stage in bringing home the 37 @entity4 citizens and residents who died on @entity5 has started with the bodies of 282 victims arriving by train in @entity6 's @entity13 where they will be prepared to be formally identified			1
prime minister @entity0 said @entity14 would be headed up by former defence chief @entity15 , who also coordinated @entity4 search efforts for @entity17			1
the refrigerated train carrying the dead has arrived in @entity13 - in @entity6 's east - where @entity4 and @entity21 representatives will prepare them for transport to the @entity21 for the identification process			1
the transportation and identification process in @entity6 and the @entity21 will involve consular officers , @entity29 experts and air safety investigators			1
an @entity4 c - 17 globemaster plane will help transport the 282 victims ' bodies to the @entity21 city of @entity34			1
despite tuesday 's progress , mr @entity0 warned there was ' still a long , long way to go '			1
' after the crime comes the cover - up , ' he told reporters in @entity41 on tuesday			1
' what we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale , and obviously that has to stop			2
' mr @entity0 said he understood the families ' frustration at the lengthy process , but it was something that needed to be done			1
' i need to caution that this is necessarily a painstaking and methodical process that will take some weeks , ' he said			2
' it would be terrible to compound families â€™ grief by risking the misidentification of their loved ones			0
' mr @entity0 also stressed the @entity69 's main objectives were ' to ensure the bodies are returned , the site is secured , the investigation goes forward and justice is done '			1
also on tuesday , mr @entity0 signed a condolence book for the victims on behalf of the nation , writing : ' twenty - three million @entity4 share the sadness of those who mourn			1
' carriages of death : a train carrying the remains victims of the @entity83 @entity5 disaster arrives in the @entity6 government - held city of @entity13 journalists follow the train as it arrives in the city of @entity13 , where the victims will be flown to the @entity21 mr @entity0 said @entity14 would be ' painstaking ' but necessary as it would prevent wrong identification the train arrived in @entity13 on tuesday night , carrying the bodies of @entity5 victims from the crash site the bodies will be flown to the @entity21 from @entity13 to be formally identified by forensic and identification experts @entity14 started just hours after foreign minister @entity96 helped secure a unanimous vote in the @entity99 @entity98 to allow ' safe , secure , full and unrestricted access ' to the @entity83 crash site for international investigators in a move to find out who is responsible for the tragedy			1
' there must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site , ' ms @entity96 told the @entity98			0
' the victims must be treated with dignity , brought back to their homes and laid to rest			1
' all parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts			0
' @entity115 must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this			0
@entity115 must also use its influence to bring the conflict in @entity6 to an end			1
' @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 - aged 12 , eight and 10 - were among the @entity4 victims @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) were another two victims of the @entity5 crash mr @entity0 's formal message of condolence to the victims ' families on behalf of the nation former defence chief @entity15 has been charged with the job to bring the bodies of @entity4 home to their families retrieving the bodies has been an arduous task , which took five days to secure after @entity143 rebels finally agreed to release them			1
they will now be flown to the @entity21 , where the doomed @entity83 flight took off to @entity147			1
@entity21 prime minister @entity148 said the first bodies would be flown to @entity34 - in the south of the country - to begin a torturous identification process he warned could take months			1
after arriving in @entity34 , the bodies will be taken to the @entity155 military barracks in @entity156 , about 100 kilometres away			0
' as soon as a victim is identified first and foremost the family will be informed and no one else			0
that can take weeks or months , ' mr @entity148 said			0
in the central @entity21 city of @entity164 , a team of 150 investigators has been pulled together to begin the grisly and painstaking task of trying to identify the victims			1
they include police officers , military personnel , forensic dentists and other medics , who have been tasked with collecting samples from close relatives around the country to help identify the 193 @entity21 victims			1
@entity176 , the team leader of the @entity177 ( known as the @entity178 ) , told the @entity179 : ' we have been collecting dna samples , hair , fingerprints , information about scars or tattoos or moles			0
' he said this information would then be handed the @entity189 ( @entity190 ) which will use sophisticated software called @entity192 to match those samples to the victims			1
an employee from the @entity21 airline company @entity196 reaches out into a sea of flowers at @entity199 in @entity199 , where the doomed flight @entity5 took off on thursday tensions running high : an armed @entity143 separatist stands guard as monitors from the @entity205 and a team of @entity208 air crash investigators inspect the crash site painstaking : @entity208 experts check debris at the main crash site of the @entity214 flight the @entity190 said this process was completed in about 30 days during an investigation into a 2010 crash in @entity218 which killed 104 people			1
but with nearly three times as many bodies to examine - and others yet to be found - it suggests this investigation could take many months			0
mr @entity176 said the identification process had been so distressing , even for experienced investigators , that the team is being assessed by a psychologist on a daily basis			2
the investigation has been all the more challenging after rebel militia were accused of allowing the crash site 's desecration and obstructing the process of recovering the bodies of the 298 victims			2
in some cases , remains have been left out for more than two days in sweltering heat and to compound matters the refrigeration unit on the train carrying them to @entity244 reportedly broke down			1
@entity6 officials said 282 corpses have been found , along with 87 fragments from 16 bodies			1
but there are fears some body parts may have been incinerated as aircraft wreckage exploded , making identification even more difficult			2
@entity208 prime minister @entity254 said , in reference to his own citizens , that following any necessary forensic work , the remains of @entity208 citizens will then be flown home to @entity208			0
the same process is expected to follow for the citizens of other countries			0
pro-russian separatists - who stand accused of bringing down the aircraft , possibly with a missile supplied by @entity268 - bowed to a furious clamour for the bodies and black boxes to be handed to investigators five days after the crash			0
mr @entity254 said the boxes were handed over to the @entity208 team in @entity244 at 9pm @entity6 time on monday			1
the small handing over ceremony has finally solved the question as to what had happened to the two vital devices			0
it was not immediately known what the @entity208 team would do with the black boxes , but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data			2
forensic experts at the crash site of the @entity294 777 , near the village of @entity296			2
all flight recorders undergo tests to be able to survive accidents , as well as forceful entry			0
this includes drop tests , as well as fire and pressure tests			0
the law requires all flight solid - state recorders can survive these conditions tragic : a toy is placed at the crash site of @entity311 near the village of @entity313 , eastern @entity6 @entity315 foreign secretary @entity314 said all the evidence currently available indicates that the surface - to - air missile which destroyed the @entity5 was supplied by @entity115 mr @entity254 revealed that in recent days the team had been working quietly behind the scenes to establish contact with ' those ' - a reference to the rebels - in charge of the @entity5 crash site			1
the contact was finally made - but he made it clear it had not been easy			0
' under difficult and fluid circumstances , we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all - securing vital evidence from the aircraft , launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives			0
' the prime minister said that in another breakthrough an independent international investigation team would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site			2
' i must stress that although agreement has been reached , there remain a number of steps required before it is completed , ' mr @entity254 said			2
' there is work still to be done , work which relies on continued communication in good faith			0
[ @entity352 leader ] mr @entity352 and his people have so far given their co-operation			0
' i ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this agreement is honoured ; that the remains of our people are returned , that the black box is handed over , and that the international team is granted full access to the site			2
' only then can the investigation into @entity5 truly begin ; only then can the victims be afforded the respect they deserve			2
we need to know what caused the plane to crash , and who was responsible for it , so that justice may be done			0
' in recent days , there were times i wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that the @entity208 people feel			0
but sometimes , we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome			0
' i understand that for the families , nothing can undo this damage			0
the lives taken can not be given back ; the dignity lost can not be regained			0
' my heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on @entity5			0
we hope and pray that the agreement reached tonight helps bring them a clear step towards closure			2

the train carrying the victims arrived at @entity13 on tuesday night
@entity4 and @entity21 representatives will then send them onto the @entity21
an @entity4 @entity398 is flying over to the @entity6 to assist
international experts will carry out the formal identification proces
@entity0 says there is a ' long , long way to go ' before a resolution is reached
