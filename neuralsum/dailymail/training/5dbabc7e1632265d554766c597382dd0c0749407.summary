by @entity0 this year , 41 - year - old @entity1 let slip a little beauty secret			2
her famously flawless complexion is not just the result of good genes and an organic diet but has been given a helping hand by a cosmetic procedure called @entity9			1
dubbed ‘ the ironing treatment ’ , @entity1 says the procedure has taken years off her face and suits her much better than rival wrinkle - busting treatment @entity13 which the actress claims made her look ' crazy , like @entity16 '			1
designed to tighten and smooth skin by promoting collagen production in its lower layers , @entity9 smooths out wrinkles , tightens saggy jowls and reduces hooding around the eyes			1
furthermore the treatment has no down time			1
fans say it is the ultimate lunchtime beauty fix			2
before : @entity0 complained she had deeper wrinkles since turning 40 after : @entity0 has noticed that her skin is less crepey and more elastic after two sessions of @entity9 i am almost exactly the same age as @entity1 and share her blonde hair and pale skin ( although sadly that ’s where the similarity ends )			1
i figure if @entity9 can take years off @entity1 then it might work for me too			1
since turning 40 i have noticed that the skin of my neck and eyelids has got slacker while the folds running between my nose and the corners of my mouth have deepened			2
the skin under my chin is also beginning to sag			2
i would give anything for @entity1 ’s dewy complexion			2
and so i present myself at the @entity52 clinic of dr @entity53			0
trusted by stars including @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , dr @entity53 , it is a leading light in the world of ‘ non-surgical facial rejuvenation ’ , in other words she can make you look younger without using a knife			1
' the demand for @entity9 is massive since @entity1 talked about it , ' she confirms			1
' i ’ve got people flying in from all over the world for it			0
' as dr @entity53 prepares the treatment room , she tells me that @entity56 ( a year older than me yet looking a least a decade younger ! ) is a fan of @entity9			1
' she is part of that generation of women who want to look their best but do n’t want that very " done " look , ' she explains			0
' what women tell me time and time again after having @entity9 is that people comment on how well they look but never guess that they ’ve had any kind of cosmetic procedure			1
' as @entity9 fan @entity85 puts it : ' for me , it ’s for enhancement , like hair colour or make - up			1
' i confess , however , that i am nervous about the treatment			2
friends who have undergone the procedure tell me that it is very painful and @entity1 herself describes it as “ a laser ” that feels as though ' someone ’s smacking your face with a rubber band that has an electric shock in it			0
' that does n’t sound good			0
dr @entity53 starts off by tackling the science bit			0
@entity1 , she tells me , is in fact wrong about @entity9 being a laser			1
@entity1 swears by ' @entity9 ' and says that @entity13 makes her look ' crazy ' the treatment actually uses radio frequency ( @entity110 ) energy			1
when the @entity110 pulse from the hand - held @entity9 tip hits the skin , the energy travels into its deepest layers where the plumping collagen is found			1
the energy actually damages the collagen making it recoil , tighten and then repair			0
the effect at the surface of the skin is both a tightening and a plumping one			0
and yes , acknowledges dr @entity53 , early forms of @entity9 were quite painful because of the heat produced			1
it did indeed feel a little like being shocked or burned			0
however a new tip for the hand - held device through which the @entity110 is delivered ( called a ‘ @entity127 ’ tip ) means energy can be delivered very effectively to the lower layers of the skin without any associated discomfort			0
i lie back in the treatment chair			2
before we begin , a grid is drawn on my face ( i look a bit like an extra from @entity138 ) , which allows dr @entity53 to make sure the heat is spread evenly			0
to begin with , she says , we will use a low setting and once she establishes how sensitive i am to the treatment , she can up the intensity			2
as the treatment begins , repeated passes are made over each area of my face and with each pass of the hand - held tip i feel heat followed by cold ( the cold is from cooling gas built into the treatment head )			2
i can honestly say that dr @entity53 is right - the procedure is almost completely painless ( other than a sensitive spot reaching from my jaw line down my neck )			0
in fact i ’m so relaxed that as she glides the @entity9 device across my face , we begin discussing the many benefits of the treatment			1
in addition to having no recovery time , dr @entity53 tells me , in some people the treatment produces a tightening effect immediately , which then develops over the following six months			2
the effects of the procedure can still be seen two and even sometimes three years later particularly if a top up treatment is given at around six months			2
' i have been variously told that i look slimmer , fitter , younger and more rested			0
however , none of my friends suspects that i have had cosmetic assistance ' she does , however , add that the effectiveness of @entity9 very much depends on the condition of the skin in the first place			1
heavy smokers or those with excessive sun damage are likely to see less satisfactory results as the tone and elasticity of the skin is so compromised			0
moreover , says dr @entity53 , @entity9 works as well on the body as on the face			1
aged hands , baggy knees , saggy tummies , drooping bottoms and wobbly cellulite can all be improved using the technique			0
it is also suitable for use on any skin tone whereas some rejuvenating lasers can not be used on darker skins			0
so why is n’t everyone having @entity9 ? after all @entity13 now seems to be available at virtually every beauty salon and dentist ’s surgery			1
dr @entity53 explains that not only would a @entity9 machine be extremely dangerous in non-skilled hands ( incorrect use could result in facial burns and scarring ) but also the technology itself is very expensive			1
consequently a session of @entity9 ( lasting around an hour depending on the surface area of skin involved ) costs £ 2,990 for the lower face and neck and £ 3,990 for full face and neck			1
and yet , says dr @entity53 , her clinic is not simply filled with an endless stream of actresses , tv stars and footballers ’ wives			0
ordinary women with modest incomes are coming to her in greater and greater numbers seeking facial rejuvenation			0
' yes these treatments are expensive but you ’ll get results lasting years ' many women will save hard and spend the money that they would have spent on face creams , cosmetics and the like each month on @entity9 instead			1
if you think of it as less than £ 100 a month then you begin to see where women find the money			0
' and nine months later ( after one top up session at six months ) can i see a difference ? well , everyone else certainly can			0
in fact i got a very satisfactory tightening effect in the days immediately after the treatment but it has been over the last few months that the effects have really started to show with my jaw line and jowls much improved and my skin less crepey and more elastic			2
i have been variously told that i look slimmer , fitter , younger and more rested			0
as dr @entity53 promised , however , none of my friends suspects that i have had cosmetic assistance with my newly freshened appearance			0
none of them has compared me to @entity1 yet but i live in hope .			0
