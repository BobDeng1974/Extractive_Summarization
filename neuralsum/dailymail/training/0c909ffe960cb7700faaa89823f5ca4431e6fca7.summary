' i have never been of the view that if you are a member of the royal family somehow you have to enter into some sort of @entity125 vow of silence , ' he told @entity127			0
' i think he is entitled to his views , but do n’t know whether those were his views because i just do n’t think providing a running commentary on private conversations is useful to anybody			0

the two sides were edging towards a ‘ significant joint declaration ’ , including military plans , although @entity10 sources said they had so far failed to agree on gas prices			0
as relations between @entity10 and the @entity146 deteriorated rapidly , @entity229 issued a friendly statement on @entity83 to @entity92 and the nations conducted a joint naval exercise			1

’ what is unusual , however , is for a senior royal to express an opinion publicly on such a clearly sensitive diplomatic issue			0
@entity2 is often criticised for meddling in domestic affairs of state as well as the infamous ‘ black spider ’ memos – so called because of his scrawling handwriting – that he is said to frequently write to ministers on issues close to his heart			1
