worst hit by jams in the @entity3 are drivers in @entity21 where last year motorists lost 72 hours of their lives in gridlock – equivalent to three whole days or nine working days			1

however , this is seven hours less than in 2011 – a drop of 19 per cent			0
one of the biggest drops is in @entity40 which encompasses @entity41 and @entity42 , where hours lost to jams are down 38 per cent - or 14 hours – to 24 hours in a year			2
in @entity45 gridlock delays are down by nearly a third ( 32 per cent ) or ten hours a year to 21 hours			0
those in @entity47 are down a quarter ( 25 per cent ) or by seven hours to 21 hours			0
by comparison , @entity21 has one of the lowest fall of nine per cent - or seven hours to 72 hours			2

the researchers found jams have actually eased over the last year as cash - strapped motorists hit with rising fuel prices have cut their driving across @entity5 , the @entity3 has the fifth highest level of gridlock in @entity5 averaging 29 hours a year behind @entity63 ( 59 hours ) , @entity64 ( 52 hours ) , @entity65 ( 37 hours ) and @entity66 ( 37 hours )			1
it is equal to @entity68 ( also 29 hours ) , but worse than @entity69 ( 25 hours ) , @entity70 ( 25 hours ) , @entity71			0
@entity21 ( at 72 hours is the third most congested city in @entity5 behind @entity72 ( 83 hours ) and @entity73 ( 77 hours ) but ahead of @entity74 ( 71 hours ) , @entity75 ( 65 hours ) and @entity76 ( 63 hours )			2
the @entity15 report says : ' overall motorists in the @entity3 spent less time in traffic than fellow drivers in @entity65 , @entity66 and the @entity64 and a massive 30 hours less than travellers in @entity5 's most congested country @entity63			1

' it tells us if people are employed and driving to work , going out to eat or doing some shopping , as well as whether or not businesses are shipping products			0
' he added : ' considering unemployment hit record highs in 2012 and @entity5 household wealth dropped 13.6 per cent it 's hardly surprising that traffic levels have dropped significantly			0

' the report says : ' drivers in @entity21 spent a full three days of 2012 sitting in traffic , that 's over a day more than the @entity3 's second most congested city @entity26 , where drivers spent 45 hours in congestion			1
' @entity26 also climbed the @entity5 ranks moving from 20th to 18th place			0
even with the jump in @entity5 rankings , all 18 @entity3 cities analysed showed declines in traffic congestion throughout the year indicative of the impact of rising unemployment and fuel prices combined with declines in consumer spending			0
