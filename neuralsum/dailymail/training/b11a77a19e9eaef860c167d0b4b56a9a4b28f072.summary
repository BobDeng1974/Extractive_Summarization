by @entity1 reporter published : 11:48 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 20 july 2012 an interactive map that plots life expectancy and child poverty by @entity7 station has revealed the stark inequalities that exist in the @entity10 's capital city			1
children who live in the salubrious surroundings of @entity13 can expect to live to an impressive 90 - years of age , yet their peers who reside just a few stops down the @entity18 line in @entity19 can only expect to reach 79			1
the largest contrast is between @entity21 , where youngsters are predicted to live to 96.38 , and @entity23 on the @entity24 , where the life - expectancy is 75.3 years			1
see the @entity26 ... the map was designed by @entity28 and @entity29 from the @entity30 at the @entity31			0
the pair hoped to reveal how widely children 's outlooks differ even though they live just minutes from eachother in the same city			0
the map covers zones 1 , 2 and most of zone 3			0
writing on his @entity40 , @entity28 , said : ' it was my intention to create a memorable impression of the persistent inequalities along ( and between ) the routes travelled by millions of @entity47 each day			0
' to create the map , the researchers drew circles with a 200m radius around each station and looked at existing life expectancy data from each city ward			1
if the circle covered more than one @entity58 ward an average was taken and all values were then rounded			2
the map found startling disparities all over @entity58			0
for instance life expectancy decreases by 12 years on the 20 minute ride on the @entity64 between @entity65 and @entity66			2
meanwhile simply crossing the @entity67 from @entity68 in the north to @entity70 in the south sees life expectancy drop by six years .			2

life expectancy *varies* from 75.3 years near @entity23 station to 96.38 at @entity21
@entity77 and @entity78 in @entity58 are among the areas with the lowest life expectancy
residents of the salubrious @entity13 can expect to live to 90
