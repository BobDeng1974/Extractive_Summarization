skillful : @entity2 is one of the most gifted players in the @entity22 staying put : despite a lot of uncertainty about his future @entity2 looks set to remain at @entity5 for now @entity2 's contract expires next summer and @entity5 are keen to offload the 27 - year - old , with @entity10 deeming him surplus to requirements			1
the 13 - cap @entity8 star is understood to favour battling to win back his first - team spot at @entity5 over any transfer			2
@entity2 has previously been a target for @entity5 's @entity22 rivals @entity36 and @entity37 , but interest has waned in this transfer window			1
@entity40 are thought to have expressed their interest to @entity5 , but @entity2 is not keen on leaving the @entity22 or returning to his first senior club			1
@entity2 joined @entity5 in 2010 and established himself as one of the most creative forces at @entity12 , but his relationship with current boss @entity10 remains strained at best			1

@entity10 revealed he could turn to teenager @entity97 for saturday 's home clash with @entity99 after the 18 - year - old impressed at @entity49			1

' there 's a good chance he could play on saturday the way he played			0
' @entity5 signed @entity97 from @entity109 in 2012 , with @entity10 revealing the flighty winger has edged ahead of home - grown youngster @entity111 during the summer			2
