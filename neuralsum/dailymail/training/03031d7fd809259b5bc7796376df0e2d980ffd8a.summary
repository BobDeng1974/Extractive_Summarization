an @entity1 agent testified thursday that former @entity3 gov. @entity2 and his wife , @entity4 , spent many nights together in the governor 's mansion - even though their lawyers claimed the couple were barely speaking to one another			1
the revelation about the @entity13 ' cohabitation calls into question the defense team 's central argument that the couple 's failing marriage made a conspiracy between them implausible			1
the agent was the final witness jurors heard from in the @entity13 ' public corruption trial			1
they will return friday morning for closing arguments before beginning deliberations on 14 charges punishable by up to decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines			1
the defense claims the marriage was so strained that the @entity13 could not have pulled off a criminal conspiracy			1
they are charged with accepting more than $ 165,000 in gifts , free vacations and loans from former @entity55 ceo @entity54 in exchange for promoting his company 's supposed panacea , the tobacco - derived anti-inflammatory @entity60			1
outside the courthouse in @entity41 thursday , @entity2 told @entity64 that he forgives @entity54			2
the former governor also said he is not concerned about the outcome of the trial			2
' i ’m 60 - year - old , i ’ve done a lot of living , ' @entity2 said			0
' i ’ve got amazing faith in @entity72 and my family and the ability of the jury to find the truth			0
' @entity54 testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the @entity13 only to get their help as he sought credibility for the product and state - backed research on its effectiveness			2
@entity84 's attorney said the first lady developed a ' crush ' on @entity54 , but he testified they were n't even friends — that the relationship was strictly professional			1
the last witness was @entity1 agent @entity91 , who analyzed the @entity13 ' cellphone records and calendars and concluded that they spent 90 per cent of their nights together during the 22 months that were the focus of the investigation			0
the testimony was intended to undercut the marital discord theory promoted by the defense			0
wandering eye : an attorney for @entity84 , left , pictured thursday with her son , @entity40 , center , said the former first lady had a ' crush ' on entrepreneur @entity54 growing apart : @entity2 ( center ) testified that he got into the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his @entity4 's anger most of the nights together were in the governor 's mansion , @entity91 testified , but some were on trips			1
@entity2 's attorney , @entity116 , challenged @entity91 's methodology and conclusions			0
he rattled off 20 occasions when @entity2 did not arrive at the governor 's mansion until 11pm or later , implying that the couple could n't have had much time together on those nights			2
@entity116 also pointed to several blank daily calendars for @entity84 , which the @entity1 agent counted as nights at the mansion			0
in response to the attorney 's question , @entity91 said she was not aware that @entity84 sometimes spent the night at the couple 's private home in suburban @entity41			1
daughter speaks : the @entity135 ' eldest daughter , @entity134 ( right ) testified that her parents ’ marriage had been troubled for 20 years and her mother ( left ) developed ' a mild obsession ' with businessman @entity54 prosecutor @entity140 suggested that the few instances raised by @entity116 did not substantially alter the overall picture of how often the @entity13 were together			1
@entity2 had testified that he got into the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his wife 's anger , and that he and his wife are living apart during the trial			2
on wednesday , the jury heard from the @entity135 ' eldest daughter , @entity134 , who also testified that her parents ’ marriage had been troubled for many years and her mom developed ' a mild obsession ' with @entity54			1
@entity154 said her parents rarely spoke to each other in private , going back decades			0
she said as far back as 20 years ago , her father was rarely home and her mother was left largely alone to raise the couple ’s five kids			2
@entity154 said she believed , even as a child , that her mother was depressed and that she took long baths and threw herself into soap operas to counter her loneliness			0
when the @entity13 were able to create family time , she said , @entity2 devoted himself to his children , and his wife received lowest priority			0
it got worse as @entity2 ’s career advanced from state delegate , to attorney general , to governor , and then in 2012 when he became a chief surrogate for @entity175 presidential candidate @entity174			0
still , @entity154 said , her parents were adept at putting up a good front in public			0
' any time they went in a public setting , it was like a switch flipped and they turned it on , ' she said .			0

the defense argued the couple 's broken marriage made a criminal conspiracy implausible
@entity135 ' eldest daughter testified her parents have been on *bad* terms for years , and her mother had a ' mild obsession ' with ceo @entity54
