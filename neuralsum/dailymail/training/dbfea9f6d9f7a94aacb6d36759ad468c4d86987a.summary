facing redundancy : every regiment in the army will be hit by the cuts that will see 8,000 soldiers lose their jobs eight thousand @entity7 soldiers – many serving on the front line in @entity10 – will be told days after @entity11 that they are to lose their jobs			1
redundancy notices will be sent to servicemen and women telling them their careers are over as part of sudden speeded - up cutbacks by the @entity18			1
the @entity19 has already been shaken by the announcement of a swathe of cuts , which included the loss of historic regiments and the prospect of a gradual reduction in personnel over the next eight years			1
but now @entity28 has discovered that the @entity18 will make a single devastating cut of 8,000 servicemen and women , reducing the @entity19 to 86,000 – its smallest size since the 1700s			1
a further 4,000 soldiers will go before 2020			1
the axe will fall across every branch and regiment of the @entity19 , with only @entity38 ringfenced			1
thousands of soldiers will disappear from regiments such as the @entity41 , the @entity42 , the @entity43 , the @entity44 and the @entity45 , which includes prince @entity46 among its officers			1
the @entity48 is expected to lose 600 of its most skilled personnel , while the @entity50 will also be badly hit			2
last night serving officers , military experts and mps condemned the drastic measure as a stab in the back for soldiers and a blow to the @entity19 ’s capability			1
former commander @entity60 , who led the @entity61 into @entity62 in 2003 , said : ‘ this is meltdown			0
we ’re still fighting in @entity10 , the world is changing rapidly and looks increasingly dangerous yet the government is crippling our operational capability			0
‘ the sheer size of the redundancies in a single hit will devastate morale and send totally the wrong message to soldiers on the front line			1
in the new year they could find envelopes on their doormats with bad news inside			0
the job cuts across the @entity19 can not sit alongside @entity7 ’s commitments to its operations against the @entity80 and terrorist organisations appearing in other countries			1
’ in another move , @entity84 officers would be forced to retire at 45 – ten years earlier than at present – in a radical proposal by a @entity88 member of the @entity89			1
outspoken : former commander lt colonel @entity60 , pictured in @entity62 , described the cuts as ' crippling ' drastic : a further 4,000 soldiers will go by 2020 - leaving the @entity19 at its smallest size since the 1700s @entity93 mp wants to pare down the number of senior officers , leaving just a small cadre to fill specialist positions advising politicians			1
the plan , called ‘ @entity100 ’ , represents the most drastic change to the structure of the @entity19 since the @entity103			2
under his proposal , which could become policy by 2015 if it is approved by the government , thousands of senior officers will be forced out			1
currently the @entity19 has just over 7,000 senior officers holding the ranks of @entity110 , lieutenant colonel , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , lieutenant general and general			1
their starting salaries at these ranks range from £ 47,760 to £ 148,000			0
controversial : conservative mp @entity93 , on the @entity89 , has proposed that all @entity84 officers be forced to retire at 45 the majority of these officers are 45 or older and reducing their numbers by half would save £ 144 million a year			1
mr @entity93 believes the top end of the @entity19 is ‘ over-commanded ’ and ‘ over-administered ’ and wants the money saved on salaries to be used on benefits such as housing for serving officers			1
but former commander of @entity130 in @entity131 @entity88 , now a @entity88 mp , said : ‘ if the “ career to 45 ” scheme is introduced many of the most talented officers will leave in their early thirties			2
why would they hang around to 45 , by which time they might struggle to find really good jobs in the major industries ? ’ the sending out of 8,000 sacking letters after @entity11 has stunned senior personnel			2
one major , who expects to be among those selected for redundancy , accused the prime minister of ‘ cowardice ’			0
speaking on condition of anonymity , he said : ‘ the government and the prime minister want the redundancies out of the way in 2013 so their disgusting treatment of frontline soldiers is forgotten about by the time of the next general election			2
‘ they do n’t care what this reduction in @entity7 ’s fighting capability will do to morale or to our combat effectiveness			0
all they care about is what is on voters ’ minds the year after			0
this is a most cruel example of political expediency			0
the redundancies and the commitment to shrink the @entity19 to a strength of 82,000 could have been met by natural wastage , a slowing down of recruitment and cherry - picking those who are the most keen to leave			1
‘ some really good people are going to be chopped , some of them who are serving in @entity10 now – their post-operational tour holiday periods will end just in time for the government to hand them a @entity180 will take a skydive			2
’ more cuts : the news comes after defence secretary @entity184 announced the loss of 17 units back in july in july , defence secretary @entity184 announced the total loss of 17 units			0
at the time no schedule for the redundancies was confirmed			0
only those soldiers about to deploy to @entity10 and those serving on the front line that month will be safe from the january cull			2
no redundancy notices will be posted to @entity195			0
the @entity18 said last night : ‘ there are no plans to make any further reductions beyond the changes announced last year			0
the size and timing of any future redundancies has yet to be determined , however we aim to remove uncertainty for @entity19 personnel and their families as soon as possible			2
difficult decisions have had to be taken to deal with the multi-billion - pound black hole in the defence budget			2
’ it added that it had no plans to change the retirement age for senior officers			0
since publication of the above article and a comment piece in the @entity28 , mp @entity93 wrote this response : your article ... did not take into account my proposals for pensions and the prospects for redundancies			0
you claimed my support for the brilliant general sir @entity228 ’s blueprint of moving from a three quarter career to a half career would reduce pensions for many			0
in fact i stated it would require a generous boost to pension rights and , obviously , those following a proper second career will have many years to add to their pension pots			0
my proposals offer a route to a larger deployable force , and protect essential benefits			0
i have repeatedly defended @entity19 pension rights in @entity244 and am campaigning to get justice for a group of officers made redundant just before their earliest pension date			1
also , if an 8,000 reduction really is planned , far more of those people would be leaving through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy than compulsory discharge			0

the cut will reduce the @entity19 to 86,000 - its smallest since the 1700s
a further 4,000 soldiers will go by 2020 in the huge cutbacks
every regiment of the @entity19 will be hit with only the @entity38 protected from lay - offs
under a controversial new proposal , @entity84 officers will be forced to retire at 45 – ten years earlier than at present
