by @entity1 reporter published : 20:04 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 14 february 2013 the attorney general has launched an investigation after photographs purporting to show killer @entity5 were allegedly posted on the internet			1
the image , uploaded to @entity11 on tuesday , the 20th anniversary of the murder , allegedly showed @entity5 at a birthday party			1
it has prompted an investigation by the attorney general ’s office over fears its publication broke laws protecting his anonymity			1
@entity5 , pictured left aged 10 in 1993 , shortly after his arrest for the murder of @entity5 , right last night a spokesman said they had been alerted to a ‘ possible contempt of court ’ but refused to disclose whether the picture was in fact @entity29			1
@entity29 and @entity30 were ten when they murdered two - year - old @entity32			0
they were given new identities aged 18 , at a cost of millions to the taxpayer			0
the pair are protected by an injunction granting them lifelong anonymity for fear of revenge attacks			0
but the picture purporting to be of @entity43 was republished by more than 100 @entity11 users and could have been viewed by thousands			1
it was originally uploaded by a user who wrote : ‘ obviously no one can officially confirm it , [ but ] the pics are clearly him and while drunk he himself told people his real identity			2
’ abduction : @entity55 footage showed @entity32 being led by the hand away from the @entity57 a spokesman for the attorney general 's office said : ' the ago has been alerted to a possible contempt of court			1
we are liaising with the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) and others to establish the facts			0
mugshot : @entity30 at the time of his arrest in 1993 , when he was aged 10 ' we can neither confirm nor deny whether the pictures in question are of @entity5			1
it should be noted , there is a worldwide injunction in place which prevents the publication of any images or information purporting to identify anyone as @entity5			1
' @entity29 and @entity30 became notorious in 1993 , when they abducted @entity32 from a @entity81 shopping centre and tortured him before leaving him for dead on nearby railway tracks			0
the toddler 's disappearance launched a widespread manhunt , and the revelation that his killers were themselves children led to widespread revulsion			2

@entity30 has not been heard from since his release , but in 2010 @entity43 was returned to prison for violating his parole			0
it was later revealed that @entity29 had downloaded child pornography and shared images with others			0
