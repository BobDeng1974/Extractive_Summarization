by @entity0 @entity2 eat more than any other nation when they set sail on fancy cruise holidays , it has been claimed			1
@entity7 - based travel writer @entity6 learned some ships actually stock up on more food when they know a large bunch of @entity2 are coming on board			1
@entity6 made the discovery in december 2013 while holidaying in the @entity13 on @entity14 , a @entity16 ship			1
@entity6 ( left ) was told @entity2 eat more than any other nation when they come on board cruise ships speaking with a tour guide on board , she was told they always had to ' order more ' food when @entity2 come on board			1
' the cruise i was on had more @entity2 on than ever before			1
we were going out of @entity7 , ' @entity6 told @entity27			2
it was the first time the experienced traveller had cruised out of an @entity2 port and travelled with a group of @entity2			2
' it 's all inclusive			0
you pay for alcohol prices but they are often better than on land and it 's so easy the food is there all the time			0
' ms @entity6 was allowed into the kitchens of @entity14 to see the fine food being prepared ' i enjoyed the omelette and club sandwich so much that i ended up having them both in my cabin twice , and did n’t get around the rest of @entity50 menu , ' ms @entity51 said she explained ' cocktail happy hours ' were her weakness , with low cost prices meaning she was only spending $ 6 or $ 7 for a cocktail			2
' it was cheaper than a beer in @entity7 , ' she laughed			0
ms @entity6 said she develops ' cruise curves ' , while another passenger told her they take scales on board to monitor any weight gain			1
' we were all laughing about how much we were overeating , ' she added			0
writing on her blog ms @entity6 explained : ' there 's something about stepping on board a cruise ship that makes normal eating – and drinking – patterns just fly out the stateroom window			1
sure , there are those who nibble on salads and actually go to the gym , but for the rest of us it 's a case of " i 'm on holiday , i should enjoy my food " to the power of a curvy 10			0
' @entity6 travelled the @entity13 in december 2013 on @entity14 , a @entity16 ship ' second or third helpings at breakfast followed by a three - course lunch , an afternoon tea or ice cream ( or both ) and then a four - course dinner with a cheese chaser are perfectly acceptable			1
in fact , it feels like it would be a waste not to take advantage of such a bounty of food			0
especially when so many of your fellow cruisers ( or should that be enablers ? ) are doing the same , ' she added			0
amused by the idea that her fellow countrymen were making a name for themselves as the greediest guests , the travel writer did some further research and found that coffee , salmon and gin and tonic are some of the particular items that ships stock up on when they know @entity2 are travelling			2
cruise ship company @entity115 claimed in 2013 that ' when they have @entity2 on board coffee orders are up 500 per cent compared to @entity117 , ' ms @entity51 remarked			1
the chefs preparing one of the many dishes on offer to hungry @entity2 ' there ’s something about stepping on board a cruise ship that makes normal eating – and drinking – patterns just fly out the stateroom window , ' ms @entity51 explained ' they make lots of flat whites , ' she laughed			1
' when they are coming out of @entity2 the @entity133 also has to put 10 kg of salmon a day on extra			2
' and the number of gin and tonics drunk also goes up 200 per cent over the @entity117 , ' she said			0
ms @entity51 documented her trip on @entity16 's @entity14 on her blog adventures all around , where she posted examples of the food she devoured on board			0
' there was this insane desert , this crème brulee , it was super fancy , ' she said			0
one of the many courses being prepared for the cruise ships guests enjoying their all inclusive feasts ' everything on there was insane , you pay 10 dollars for lunch and 25 dollars for dinner , ' she explained			0
ms @entity6 ' @entity13 cruise visited exotic places such as @entity157 and @entity158 and she then had ' the joy of coming into @entity7 harbour '			1
' everyone gets up at 5.30am in the morning as you come in to the harbour when the sun is rising through the heads , ' she said			0
a spokesperson for @entity16 told @entity27 : ' the comment that was made on the galley tour was very anecdotal and was n't based on any official fact			2

@entity6 made the discovery while on a @entity13 cruise
tour guide told her the ship always orders more food for @entity2
she said the all inclusive food means you eat way more than normal
