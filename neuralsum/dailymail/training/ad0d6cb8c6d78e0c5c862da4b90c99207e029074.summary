by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:14 est , 7 february 2014 when one geologist stumbled across a massive mound 65 years ago , he had no idea his discovery would spark one of the world ’s strangest scientific mysteries			1
the site in @entity13 , @entity11 was discovered in 1949 and is a huge convex cone with a funnel - shaped recess and a rounded hill in the middle , which looks a little like an eagle ’s nest with an egg nestled inside it			1
the origin of the @entity23 crater has baffled scientists for decades and theories for its existence have ranged from a nuclear blast to a secret gulag mine and even a meteorite strike			1
the site in @entity13 , @entity11 was discovered in 1949 and is a huge convex cone with a funnel - shaped recess and a rounded hill in the middle , which looks a little like an eagle 's nest with an egg nestled inside it the mysterious crater - also known as the ' eagle 's nest ' - was discovered 65 years ago in @entity13 , @entity11 , by a @entity41 geologist			1
the cone is 80 metres tall from the lowest point of its base and measures 150 metres wide			0
it is thought to be just 250 years old , although estimates differ widely			1
scientists previously suggested it was a slagheap , but now think there were not enough people living in the area to create it			0
some people believe it was made by aliens			0
scientists threw out the idea that the mound was made as the result of a uranium ore explosion as the site has low background radiation			2
they have floated the idea that it could have been made by a volcano , but none have been found nearby			0
an impact made by a meteorite is the favourite theory but no evidence of fragments has been found			1
it is thought there is something with a high iron content over 100metres below the crater , which could be a meteorite			1
the crater is ' alive ' and changes shape - by rising and falling - constantly			2
trees nearby the site are reported to grow abnormally fast			0
the current thinking is that the site was indeed created by a meteorite strike , but no evidence has been found to support the theory			1
the cone is 80metres tall and has a diameter of 150metres at its widest			0
the depth of the inner circle ditch is around 10metres			0
it was named @entity91 after a nearby river and was discovered by a geologist called @entity94 who tried and failed to arrange a scientific trip to examine the site , but numerous expeditions have taken place since and one last year collected samples			2
theories that the mound is a giant slagheap have been thrown out as there were not enough people living nearby when the crater is thought to have formed to create such a pile			2
and there were never labour camps or gulags in the region			0
half a tonne of samples were taken from the site and removed by helicopter last year			0
the samples led scientists to dismiss ideas of a uranium ore explosion as the background radiation at the site is low and no uranium has been found nearby either			2
this left them with two main theories – one of a volcano and another of a meteorite			0
however , the mysterious site has not given up any meteoritic material and the area is not thought to be volcanic			2
in fact there are no volcanoes within thousands of kilometres of the @entity23 crater and it also seems to be relatively new			1
the origin of the @entity138 crater has baffled scientists for decades and theories for its existence have ranged from a nuclear bomb blast , a secret @entity145 mine and meteorite strike the cone is 80metres tall and has a diameter of 150metres at its widest			2
the depth of the inner circle ditch is around 10metres scientists thought the crater was only between 100 and 500 years old and could be the result of the @entity156 , which fell in the @entity158 region in 1908 , but whose crater has never been discovered			1
it is thought the meteorite was sighted just 70km away from the ‘ eagle ’s nest ’ and that distance is a mere 10 to 15 seconds of flight			0
as the tunguska event occurred in 1908 , the age coincides , but modern tests have shown that the crater is actually 250 years old – so it could have been formed by a previous meteorite that fell when the area was virtually unpopulated			1
the strange mound was found in @entity13 , @entity11 ( pictured ) was discovered in 1949 but it was only last year that scientists took samples from the site the crater was named @entity138 after a nearby river and was discovered in @entity11 ( pictured ) by a geologist called @entity94 who tried and failed to arrange a scientific trip to examine the site			1
the first expedition only took place last year scientists now think that there is something with a high iron content and ferromagnetic materials buried between 100 and 150 metres underneath the crater			0
they believe it could be a meteorite or another incredibly dense object , but they are not certain			0
the fact that the crater is ‘ alive ’ as its shape changes constantly - by rising and falling - and that the trees nearby the site are reported to grow abnormally fast , adds to the mystery			1
