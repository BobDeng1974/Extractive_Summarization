@entity0 says he is feeling stronger than ever after a full summer of rest and is ready to lead @entity4 ’s quest to win six trophies next season			1
if they are to pull off the grand slam they will have to become the first team ever to retain the @entity11 but @entity0 , who goes back to @entity12 next month to compete for the first of those cups , believes anything is possible after another summer of spending in the @entity18 capital			1

it will be special playing the @entity24 in @entity12			0
that ’s the first one we can win but we will be fighting for everything			0
i do n’t know if that will mean more pressure this season but we certainly have more hunger than ever			0
we want to retain our @entity11			2
' asked about the advantage of not having played in the @entity52 he added : ' it was disappointing not being in @entity54 but i have had seven weeks of rest and i can now have a full pre-season			1
' i want to have an even better season than last year : i want to give more assists and score more goals ; i want to improve in every aspect			0
' last year as @entity0 ’s transfer from @entity62 dragged on beyond the start of the season and he was left playing catch - up with his fitness			1
there were even doubts over whether he had been worth @entity4 ’s huge investment			2

it was a massive change for me but in time i have become very comfortable here			0
' this year it is the turn of @entity83 to fit into his new surroundings			2
@entity0 said : ' he showed what a great player he is at the @entity52			1
hopefully he can repeat that form for us next season			0
' the @entity18 league is the most exciting at the moment			0
the best players are playing here and @entity108 and @entity4 are always fighting for the @entity11			1
it ’s an honour to play in this league			0
' @entity4 will win six trophies if they retain the @entity11 , win the @entity112 and @entity27 , and lift the @entity113 , the @entity114 and the @entity115 to be played in @entity12 on august 12 .			1
