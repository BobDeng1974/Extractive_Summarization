by @entity0 the doctors and therapists who worked with a little girl from @entity4 knew the prosthetic arm they gave her would change her life			1
what they did n't anticipate was that within weeks of strapping on her new limb , seven - year - old @entity8 would be using it to pick up a brush and begin carving out a new life â € ” of abstract painting			1
' what color would you like ? ' asked artist @entity17 as he sat next to her at a table at the @entity20 on @entity21 in the heart of @entity23 on wednesday afternoon			1
bright future : @entity8 , seven , who lost her arm and right eye after picking up a grenade in her native @entity4 , is seen painting with her new prosthetic arm during a private session with artist @entity32 in @entity23 , @entity33 ' that one ! ' the normally reticent girl responded with a determined voice as she pointed to a tube of blue acrylic			1
then , before her mentor could fetch it , she grabbed it with her new prosthetic hand , unscrewed the top with her other hand and began squeezing the tube 's contents onto a palette			2
as her friends from the @entity48 and the @entity50 @entity49 looked on with delight , @entity8 proceeded to put a series of broad brush strokes across a piece of art board @entity32 had provided			1
soon there were shades of blue , green and bright orange laid out across little stickers of fish , bunnies , a flower and sky that @entity32 had showed her how to place on the board beforehand			0
at one point she giggled with embarrassment as she accidentally squeezed a tube of orange paint onto the painting rather than the palette			0
but @entity32 quickly assured her that accidental art sometimes makes the best abstract art. ' you 're going to do a @entity76 , ' he quipped			0
the finished result , the artist said afterward , ' was pretty mind - blowing			0
' @entity8 , he said , not only handles a brush well but has an impressive grasp of matching colors			2
' she kind of has a facility for it if she wants to pursue it , ' added the artist whose own work is the subject of a large exhibition on display at @entity20			0
talented : @entity8 shows off her latest masterpiece			2
@entity32 ( right ) has described her work as ' mind - blowing ' industrious : @entity8 gets to work on her next painting while artist @entity32 ( far right ) and @entity20 owner @entity100 ( center ) look on less than a year ago , @entity8 was back at home in @entity4 when she went outside one morning to play with her brother			1
there had been a violent battle pitting @entity108 fighters against @entity110 military forces the night before , but that was nothing residents were n't used to			2
their village had been a cauldron of violence since the @entity4 war began			1
' there was what looked like a rock that she picked up and threw on the ground and it exploded , ' said @entity123 , a @entity125 member who brought her to the @entity110 , where @entity50 treated her for free			1
the explosion had destroyed her right eye , taken off most of her right arm , put a few scars on her face and killed her brother			1
she was a little frightened the first time he saw her , said @entity135 , a prosthetist who helped fit her with her new arm			2
but she quickly warmed to the people around her and impressed them with how quickly she learned how to use it			0
life - changing : the youngster shakes hands with her doctor , @entity144 certified prosthetist @entity143 , who was born without his left arm she 'll return to her family next week , but @entity147 plans to bring her back next year to fit her with a prosthetic eye and attend to her scars			1
fluent in the @entity4 languages of @entity152 and @entity153 , she 's also picked up a good deal of @entity155 since arriving in the @entity110 late last year			1
also an affinity for @entity110 culture			2
decked out in a pretty dress and a pair of @entity161 shoes , she sometimes sang along to the song ' let it go ' from the @entity164 film ' @entity165 ' as she painted			0
afterward she was a bit quiet but still all smiles as she wandered the gallery with an @entity169 , snapping pictures of the paintings , the sculptures and the people			0
and also a few selfies to take back home			0
fond memories : @entity8 takes a selfie with @entity123 , the @entity125 member who brought her to the @entity110 where she could be treated for free creative inspiration : young artist @entity8 uses an @entity169 to snap a bronze sculpture at @entity20 but before heading home to her host family and then @entity4 there was still some unfinished business			1
as the afternoon grew longer and the gallery crowd thinned , @entity32 asked if she might like to do another painting			0
' yes ! ' came the exuberant reply			0
and the pair got back to work			0

@entity8 , seven , lost her right eye and arm while playing in her @entity4 village less than a year ago . she picked up what she thought was a rock which exploded , severely *injuring* her and killing her brother
the youngster was helped by the @entity48 which brought her to the @entity110 , where @entity50 in @entity49 treated her for free
