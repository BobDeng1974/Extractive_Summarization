@entity1 customer @entity0 , who discovered he had been secretly signed up by the firm to make monthly donations to @entity4 bungling @entity1 workers secretly signed up a broadband customer to make monthly donations to @entity4 despite never having asked for his permission			1
@entity0 , from @entity9 - in - @entity10 in @entity11 was shocked to see that when he checked his internet bill , he was signed up to make monthly direct debits to the firm 's ' supporters group '			1
the 45 - year - old married sales manager says the bill showed he had already paid three donations to the supporters fund without even realising			1
only when he did an online search for the @entity1 supporters fund did he realise the cash was going to the @entity24 's appeal @entity4			2
he then challenged the company , who could have taken donations worth £ 36 a year from his bank account without permission			1
mr @entity30 said : ' i was never asked whether i wanted to make charity donations through my @entity1 account			1
' their nominated charity is the @entity24 ’s @entity4			0
i have nothing against the money - raisers at the @entity24 but it was shocking not to have even been asked if i wanted to donate			2
' i challenged the bill and was told by @entity1 that it would take a week for them to listen to a recording of my phone call at the time i signed off for the broadband package			1
' when contacted , a spokesman for @entity1 said today that they wished to apologise to mr @entity0 and added that they had repaid the charity donation money wrongly taken out of his account			1
but mr @entity0 added : ' i got the impression @entity1 did not really care about their mistake while i was trying to get them to correct the error			1
however , once the media took up my case , there was instant success			0
the @entity24 's appeal which was presented by sir @entity61 and @entity62 , pictured , was broadcast last week			0
mr @entity0 was unaware he was signed up to donate to the charity ' it makes you wonder how many other customers are inadvertently paying charity donations without even realising it			1
when a direct debit arrangement is in place , customers should receive advance notice confirming when payments will be taken and how much they will be – it is advisable to check this to confirm the details are correct			0
if a direct debit payment has been taken which is not what was agreed – for example , too much has been taken or the payment has been taken on the wrong date - you are entitled to an immediate refund of the amount debited from your bank under the direct debit guarantee			0
if you can not get the company - which in this case was @entity1 - to sort out the problem , contact your bank			2
the guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay direct debits			0
he now says he will be keeping a close eye on his statements after the mix - up which he claims happened when he renewed his contract			0
he said : ' as you can imagine , i was most perturbed			0
i had renegotiated my contract with @entity1 about a month earlier and nothing whatsoever was mentioned about a direct debit			2
' something was very clearly wrong			0
it was theft from my bank account because they were taking money i have n’t agreed to			0
' if i had n’t noticed that , it would have been £ 36 a year , which may not seem a lot , but in these times that ’s a lot of money for some people			0
' i am sure there are many others who are blindly giving away cash because they have n’t noticed			0
i probably would n’t have noticed if i had n’t been looking at my bill so closely			0
' @entity1 was supporting @entity4 at the time but it could be another charity , i do n’t know how regularly it rotates , and customers could be giving money to charities they do n’t especially wish to support			2
mr @entity0 says @entity1 often rotate the charity they support and at the time he was donating , the cash was going to @entity4 , whose mascot is @entity132 bear , pictured with sir @entity61 ' people are being left out of pocket by this and it ’s not on			1
@entity1 has a responsibility to make people aware of what they are signing up to			2
' a spokesman for @entity1 explained : ' @entity1 customer services have removed the donation charge and put a £ 12 credit on to mr @entity0 ’s account as an apology			1
' customer services have not been able to speak to mr @entity0 but have left a voicemail and emailed him			1
