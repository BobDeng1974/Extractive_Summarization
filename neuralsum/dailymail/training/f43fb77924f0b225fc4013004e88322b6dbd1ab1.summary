by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 10 june 2013 they faced harsh reviews when they dropped the @entity3 and the calligraphy - style font during a major rebrand			1
and now @entity8 giant @entity7 come under fire again - this time for extraordinarily high pricing			0
first it was revealed last month that the luxury fashion house reportedly priced a jacket at £ 40,420			1
and now it has been discovered that the embellished babydoll dress @entity16 wears in its latest @entity18 campaign is being sold for an eye - watering £ 48,830			1
the mindboggling price was reported by @entity21 in an article about the opening of a new @entity24 in @entity26 's @entity25			2
the jacket cost £ 43,000 , and the cut is based on the @entity30 suit style form the 1960s a photograph of an original vintage @entity30 look suit - approximately sold for £ 349 altogether at the time the jacket was available to buy on the @entity37 saint laurent site up until three weeks ago before it disappeared			1
after the price was reported on multiple fashion sites , reporters from the @entity40 say that they made contact with @entity7 's personal shopper service and were told the jacket was not in stock anywhere in @entity48			2
they were not able to find a record of the garment ever having been sold in the @entity51 , and it was not known whether the jacket was removed , or had simply sold out			2
the item description for the expensive leopard print jacket calls it an ' open jacket in grain de poudre wool ' - the luxe wool @entity60 use to make their @entity30 suits			1
but the item contains only 10 per cent of this fabric			2
the rest is made up of 80 per cent polyester and 10 per cent satin			1
@entity7 currently sells @entity30 tuxedo trousers made entirely from grain de poudre wool for less than £ 1,000			2
the jacket , while composed of fancy sequin embroidery in @entity7 's signature babycat leopard print , is made almost entirely of synthetic fibres			0
one web user , named fashionista - ta said in the @entity40 's forum thread : ' i can understand needing to cut costs on this piece , but what about non-virgin wool instead of polyester ? ? even ( perhaps especially ) filthy rich people sweat			1
' @entity16 , wearing the £ 40,000 dress , lets out her inner grunge rock chick in the new campaign showing off the embellished dress , the three minute advert focuses on this item in particular recent reports say prices at luxury brands are determined by analysts whose interest lies in creating giant profit margins , sometimes even against a designer 's wishes			1
they decide on costs to consumers according to what they think customers are willing to spend on high fashion , not what it costs to produce it			0
and with shoppers willing to pay the price , it looks as though these kinds of high price points might just be the new norm at the fashion house			0
@entity115 fashion expert @entity114 told the @entity116 : ' obviously , the average person could never afford a £ 43,000 dress ( are we sure those 000 's are n't a typo ? ! )			0
' that said , the artistry that has been put into high - end designer pieces is what makes them so unique , and is why i am so inspired by the fashion that comes out of the high - end designer labels			0
' the @entity40 enquired with the @entity7 press office for information on the production of the jacket and how the brand determined the price , but have not heard back			0
we contacted @entity7 this morning with similar questions and are yet to hear back from them			0
@entity139 , the journalist who wrote deluxe : how @entity141 , an exposé about how luxury became a global , multibillion dollar industry , answered some of the @entity40 's questions about how brands determine price : ' when it comes to brands in major groups , the sole motivating factor is profits			0
the designers can dream up beautiful designs , but the number crunchers will cut costs wherever they can to raise the profit margin			1
' i also know that at times , designers like to use cheap fabrics not because they do n't cost much but because of the effect they cause creatively			0
but even if the fabric costs $ 2 a metre , and the dress costs $ 50 to produce , the number crunchers will price it at $ 3,000 retail			1
' one designer told me a case where this happened and he even protested the high price			0
and the number crunchers did n't care			1
their argument : consumers will pay it			0
