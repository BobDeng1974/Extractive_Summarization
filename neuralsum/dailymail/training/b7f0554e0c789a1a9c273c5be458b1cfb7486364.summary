the biggest surprise about that charming bunch of so - called @entity3 fans shoving a @entity4 off the @entity5 just because he was black is that so many people found it surprising			1
do we really believe incidents like this are not occurring whenever and wherever football crowds gather ? come off it			1
it just so happens that this one was caught on film			2
the man attempts to board but is refused entry by fans travelling to the @entity20 tie in @entity21 the amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident these particular yobs fell foul of the technology which is revealing more and more of the horrors of the world in which we live			1
by way of extreme example , there would be no global revulsion and no condemnation of the atrocities being committed in the perverted name of @entity39 were it not for those videos of hostages being decapitated and burned alive , homosexuals being thrown off roofs , women whose veils slip being stoned to death and non-believers being converted to the @entity39 faith by amputations of their arms and legs			2
no military intervention by the western powers , either			2
barbaric monstrosities are nothing new			2
except that now they appear on our television screens			2
there are parallels , albeit mercifully less graphic , with hooliganism			1
the advent of closed circuit cameras has done more than any other measure to minimise violence in our football stadia			1
but genuine supporters and innocent passers - by are still being terrorised on their way to and from the grounds , be it in the surrounding streets , on railway platforms or at motorway service stations			1
the authorities tell us the curse has been cured			1
the reality is that football - related violence has merely been suppressed			1
of course , in large measure , that is because an undercurrent of these angry , brutal tendencies continues to course through our society			0
we still are a warrior nation , after all			0
@entity3 fans are kept back by police after the final whistle of the @entity20 match on tuesday night a map showing where the incident occurred at the @entity96 station and where the stadium is ( left ) @entity98 , presenter and ex footballer : ' just saw the video of the @entity3 mob 's deplorable behaviour and racist chants			0
sickening , embarrassing , moronic , disgraceful			0
' @entity104 , @entity3 's first ever black footballer : ' i watched it and i was in disgust , i was so angry and ashamed			1
we ’ve done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it ’s brought it all right back down			0
i do n’t care if it ’s the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention @entity3 this will be the response			0
i ca n’t believe this has come about			0
' @entity121 , pundit and ex footballer : ' @entity3 fans			0
save your spite for those on the train , i 'm sure you 'll want to see them banned from holding season tickets at your club			1
' @entity131 , pundit and ex footballer : ' i hope that every black @entity133 watches that			1
' @entity135 , @entity136 president : ' i also condemn the actions of a small group of @entity3 fans in @entity21			0
there is no place for racism in football			1
' @entity144 , pundit and ex footballer : ' @entity3 what you gon na do ? your club has been linked to racism for so long ! what have you done ? put a couple of signs up in your ground ? those guys on the train remind me of my childhood			0
@entity158 you with their mates ! but when alone and confronted , i 've seen them cry			0
' it manifests itself in road rages , pub brawls , rapes of inebriated women and gratuitous physical harm inflicted during robberies and muggings			0
and in truth it is getting worse			0
those of us who bore dismayed witness to the riots which shamed our nation and its game in the 70s , 80s and early 90s – and who mourned at such fatal tragedies as @entity182 and @entity183 – have welcomed every innovation , from those cameras to all - seater stadia , which has put the lid on this scourge			2
and the most recent evidence indicates that hooliganism is on the rise again			1
such is human nature that complacency is pretty much inevitable when something like heavy policing appears to have solved a problem			0
and there have been glimpses of late of disturbances returning to the stands and incursions onto the pitches			0
complacency mushrooms into negligence when government starts paying heed to campaigns for a throw - back to so - called ‘ safe standing			1
’ mr prime minister , consider yourself warned that the activists are all too aware that moving , shoving crowds have long provided the cover for hooligan rampages			2
@entity3 , the @entity217 and @entity218 have condemned what happened on the way to the @entity222 ’s @entity20 match in the @entity223 on tuesday night			0
they and they victim are calling for arrests , charges , perhaps prison sentences			0
but the reaction of other responsible bodies – @entity232 and to some extent the @entity234 – has been to abdicate responsibility for any outrages taking place in the city rather than the stadium			0
that is not just disingenuous			0
the @entity243 game has done more than most in trying to kick out racism but it is not good enough simply to boot the thugs out of the ground , onto the streets			0
if you organise big , money - making football matches you have a duty of care as to what happens on the way to and from those events			1
football hooligans crawl out of the holes created by the burial of heads in the sand			2
there was a belief back in football ’s darkest days that hooliganism was incited by the violence of players on the pitch			1
if that still holds true , it is reasonable to suppose that in addition to the man - handling of a black @entity5 passenger on the way to @entity3 ’s @entity20 game at @entity21 on tuesday night there was more trouble in the city later that night which went unrecorded			1
the way the @entity280 team queued up to kick @entity281 was nothing short of disgraceful			1
hazard ’s controlled response – riding the assaults and restraining his emotions – was noble , putting to shame the opponents trying to kick him out of the match and the referee who failed to protect him			2
@entity281 appeared to be targeted by players of @entity280 in their @entity20 tie on tuesday night the @entity295 forward is sent tumbling by @entity296 during the 1 - 1 draw at the @entity223 @entity3 forward hazard is surviving at the moment thanks to his stocky build and solid bones thus he played a major part in enabling @entity3 to come through a fraught assignment by bringing home to the second leg at @entity305 the 1 - 1 draw which included that precious away goal			1
but in truth hazard is being treated almost as scandalously here every week			1
that is the price which referees and the ruling bodies of the game appear to think he should pay for being the best player in the @entity234			0
@entity281 is surviving at the moment thanks to his stocky build , solid bones , nimble evasion of some of the more malicious lunge and considerable courage			1
since he could well have used this as an excuse to go seek safer and more enriching employment at @entity322 or @entity323 , @entity3 and their fans should be deeply grateful that he has signed a two - year extension to his contract			2
the least we can do by way of rewarding this electrifying young footballer is for we writers to elect him as @entity331 and his peers honour him as their @entity333 .			0

the biggest surprise abut the so - called supporters shoving a man off the @entity5 because he was black , is that so many found it surprising
the authorities tell us the curse has been cured *...* but the reality is that football - related violence has merely been suppressed
most recent evidence indicates that hooliganism is on the rise again
@entity281 has been treated scandalously by opponents this season
