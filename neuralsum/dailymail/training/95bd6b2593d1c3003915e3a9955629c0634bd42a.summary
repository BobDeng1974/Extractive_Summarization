and if @entity10 's prime minister @entity9 was half - hearted when she welcomed the @entity11 to her country last month , she certainly did not hold back with @entity13			1
the pair exchanged a warm embrace on the tarmac at @entity17 as the president flew in for a whirlwind visit before heading on to @entity20			0

@entity29 troops and aircraft will operate out of the tropical city of @entity42 , only 820 kms from @entity20 , able to respond quickly to any humanitarian and security issues in @entity44 , where disputes over sovereignty of the @entity47 are causing rising tensions			1
' with my visit to the region , i am making it clear that the @entity29 is stepping up its commitment to the entire @entity36 , ' mr @entity13 said			1
' it is appropriate for us to make sure ... that the security architecture for the region is updated for the 21st century and this initiative is going to allow us to do that			0
' biggest fan : mrs @entity9 smiles up at mr @entity13 during a press conference in @entity17 partnership : mr @entity13 revealed that @entity29 troops are to be stationed in @entity10 for the first time since @entity63 light touch : the pair exit the stage after holding the press conference mr @entity13 said he was deeply concerned about the euro zone crisis and warned that market turmoil would continue until @entity70 has a concrete plan to deal with its sovereign debt worries			1
his comments came as equity markets fell in response to a sell - off in euro zone bond markets			0
' until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that @entity70 is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes , we are going to continue to see the kinds of market turmoil we saw , ' he said			0
he added that while there had been progress in putting together unity governments in @entity91 and @entity92 , @entity70 still faced a ' problem of political will ' rather than a technical problem			0
' we 're going to continue to advise @entity70 leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down			0
it is going to require some tough decisions on their part			0
' ultimately , what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal - we stand behind the @entity70 project , we stand behind the euro			0
' the @entity29 deployment to @entity10 is likely to add to @entity111 's concerns that @entity112 is trying to encircle it with bases in @entity115 and @entity116 and now troops in @entity10			1
but mr @entity13 stressed that @entity111 was not being isolated			2
' the notion that we fear @entity111 is mistaken			2
the notion that we are looking to exclude @entity111 is mistaken , ' he said , adding @entity111 was not being excluded from the planned @entity120 ( @entity121 ) on trade			2
' we welcome a rising , peaceful @entity111 , ' he added before saying that the country 's rising power means it must take on greater responsibilities to ensure free trade and security in the region			1
' it 's important for them to play by the rules of the road and , in fact , help underwrite the rules that have allowed so much remarkable economic progress , ' he said			0
the @entity29 deployment to @entity10 , the largest since @entity63 , will start next year with a company of 200 - 250 marines in @entity42 , the ' @entity138 of @entity10 ' , mrs @entity9 said			1
more bombs were dropped on @entity42 during a surprise @entity115 raid than on @entity138 , @entity141			1
a total of 2,500 @entity29 troops would eventually rotate through the port city			1

@entity111 has already expressed concern about the plan			2

pomp and ceremony : the pair attended a parliamentary dinner in @entity17 to mark mr @entity13 's visit sharing a joke : the pair appeared to be enjoying themselves during the evening pledge : mrs @entity9 watches as mr @entity13 sings the @entity29 national anthem dinner : president @entity13 and @entity10 prime minister @entity9 walk to their table at @entity170 mr @entity13 landed in @entity10 amid a security alert after it emerged documents indicating possible locations he could visit were left in view			1
documents detailing places that @entity29 secret service agents had visited in order to check out possible locations the the commander in chief could visit while in the city were left on the front seat of an unmanned old van - visible to anyone who peered in			1
there could have been major security problems if the papers had been viewed by terrorists who could have targeted the buildings should they have been chosen as places to visit by the president			0
a team of local drivers employed by the @entity29 secret service was asked to drop their time sheets , detailing schools and others buildings they had taken agents to , through the window of the van which was parked at the rear of a hotel			2
one local driver claimed he was sacked for refusing to send timesheets - showing where a @entity29 agent from the @entity29 @entity207 had been - unaccompanied in a taxi to the hotel car park where the papers were to be dropped through the van 's window			1
that particular time sheet detailed suburbs and buildings that the agent had visited last week , @entity214 's @entity213 reported			0

@entity111 stands for ' peaceful development and cooperation '			2

' we also believe that the external policies of countries in the region should develop along these lines , ' @entity223 told a regular news briefing in @entity233			2
some @entity235 nations are likely to welcome the @entity29 move as a counterbalance to @entity111 's growing military power , especially its expanding maritime operations , and a reassurance that @entity112 will not scale back its engagement in the region due to a stretched @entity29 military budget			1
' the @entity29 hopes to militarily strengthen alliance relations with @entity115 in the north and with @entity10 in the south , with the clear intention of counter-balancing @entity111 , ' @entity244 , the director of the @entity245 at the @entity246 in @entity233 , told the @entity152 , a popular @entity111 newspaper			1
the winding down of wars in @entity255 and @entity256 has opened the door to greater @entity29 attention to simmering tension over the @entity47 , a shipping lane for more than $ 5 trillion in annual trade that the @entity29 wants to keep open			2
@entity13 plans to raise maritime security in the @entity47 at a regional summit on @entity262 this week , defying @entity111 's desire to keep the sensitive topic off the agenda			1
@entity111 claims the entire maritime region , a vital commercial shipping route rich in oil , minerals and fishery resources			0
it insists that any disputes be resolved through bilateral talks and says @entity112 has no business getting involved			0
@entity274 , the @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 hold rivals claims to at least parts of the sea and tension occasionally flares up into maritime stand - offs			0
