mayor @entity0 has slammed a group of @entity3 officers as ' disrespectful ' for turning their backs to him during a pair of funerals for slain police officers			1
in his first remarks on the officers ' protests , @entity9 said that the actions were hurtful to the families of the two cops killed in an ambush last month			1
the public rebuke , he said on monday , was an offense to the city at large			1
police commissioner @entity20 also condemned their actions			1
however , he is ' disappointed ' by ' some individual officers ' who did turn their backs			2
' they were disrespectful to the families involved , ' @entity0 said			1
' they were disrespectful to the families who had lost their loved ones			1
i ca n't understand why anyone would do such a thing in the context like that			2
' the rift between the police unions and @entity0 has created the biggest crisis of his mayoralty			1
the unions have blamed @entity0 for fostering an @entity60 atmosphere they believe contributed to the murders of the officers			1
thousands of police turned their backs on sunday as @entity0 eulogized an officer shot dead with his partner , repeating a stinging display of scorn for the mayor despite entreaties to put anger aside			1
the show of disrespect came outside the funeral home where officer @entity76 was remembered as an incarnation of the @entity79 dream : a man who had emigrated from @entity81 at age 12 and devoted himself to helping others in his adopted country			2
@entity85 mayor @entity0 and police commissioner @entity86 prepare to depart the wake of slain @entity85 police officer @entity76 at the @entity88 in @entity89 honored : despite moving to name a street in honor of detectives @entity92 ( left ) and @entity76 ( right ) who were shot to death last month , @entity0 has failed to appease thousands of @entity3 officers his young widow @entity95 , who married @entity76 just months earlier , paid a tearful tribute at the funeral , saying she had lost her ' soul mate ' and a ' wonderful husband '			1
' @entity100 will always be in my heart			2
i love you , i love you forever , ' she told him			2
' we spoke about work often and how much respect he had for the law , how he applied the law ... with courtesy , with respect and with the highest professionalism			0
' the gesture among officers watching the mayor 's speech on a screen added to tensions between the mayor and rank - and - file police even as he sought to quiet them			1
' let us move forward by strengthening the bonds that unite us , and let us work together to attain peace , ' @entity0 said at the funeral			1
last saturday , the @entity3 buried a hero			0
tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade @entity92			0
his family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display			0
but for the last seven days , the city 's and the country 's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers			2
it was not all the officers , and it was not disrespect directed at @entity151			0
but all the officers were painted by it , and it stole the valor , honor , and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective @entity92 's life and sacrifice			0
that was not that intent , i know			0
but it was the result			0
on sunday , we will gather together again , with the rest of @entity85 and law - enforcement officials nationwide , to mourn for detective @entity167			2
we gather to support his parents , his widow , and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short			0
the assassination of @entity175 and @entity92 was an attack on us all			0
as a cop , one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s , i understand that emotions are high			0
i issue no mandates , and i make no threats of discipline			0
but i remind you that when you don the uniform of this department , you are bound by the tradition , honor , and decency that go with it .			0

on monday , mayor @entity0 made his first remarks about the protests
he said it was disrespectful to the families and an offense to the whole city
police commissioner @entity86 also condemned the action on sunday
