@entity0 is finally on the reforms path once again			0
the @entity2 has boldly bitten the bullet for the sake of the nation ’s future after @entity0 got rid of the unpardonable policy paralysis of the previous @entity8			0
on saturday , the government under @entity10 kicked - off the much - needed reforms yatra by deregulating the diesel price , besides approving a new gas price policy and ensuring that the benefit of the lpg subsidy in cash directly reaches the consumers			1
with that the @entity9 has proved that it will do everything to usher in a higher growth plane			0
@entity21 finance minister @entity20 ( right ) with minister of petroleum and natural gas @entity22 during a press conference in @entity25 the good news of reforms came from @entity21 finance minister @entity20			1
“ henceforth , like petrol , the price of diesel will be market determined , ” @entity20 said after a @entity29 meeting			1
“ we have decided to reduce prices and in @entity25 the price of diesel will go down by rs 3.37 per litre from saturday midnight , ” said @entity34 , chairman of the @entity35 , the country ’s biggest fuel retailer			2
retail prices of diesel will now reflect international movement in oil prices which are currently down to a four - year low			2
this is the first reduction in diesel price in over five years			1
diesel rates were last cut on january 29 , 2009 when they were reduced by rs 2 a litre to rs 30.86			0
diesel prices were last raised by 50 paise on september 1 and cumulatively raised by rs 11.81 per litre in 19 instalments since january 2013			0
the @entity53 also approved a hike in the natural gas price to us $ 5.61 per @entity56 ( million @entity58 thermal unit ) with effect from november 1 , but @entity60 will continue to get current us $ 4.2 rate till it makes up for shortfall in output from @entity66 - @entity65 block			1
“ the @entity29 has modified the @entity68 formula approved by the previous @entity69 to bring down the increase in rates from @entity72 $ 8.4 to us $ 5.61 , ” @entity20 said			0
the new formula will be effective from november 1 and the rates will be revised every six months with the next revision being on april 1			1
“ this price takes into consideration the provision of a sufficient incentive for oil and gas exploration by the companies and is also not excessively burdensome for the consumers , ” @entity20 pointed out			2
the new formula excludes some of the international hub prices such as @entity84 , included in the earlier @entity68 formula used by the @entity69 to arrive at the higher price of @entity72 $ 8.4 which was to be implemented from april 1 , but was put on hold by the @entity89 due to the @entity91 elections			2
the private sector companies which were lobbying for a higher price appeared disappointed after the decision but @entity96 chairman @entity95 welcomed the hike saying he was “ enthused by the increase in gas price ”			1
for @entity60 's flagging @entity100 and @entity102 gas fields in kg - d6 block — where output should have been 80 mmscmd but is languishing at less than 8 mmscmd — the @entity29 decided the current rate of @entity72 $ 4.2 per @entity56 will continue to apply			0
consumers will , however , pay the revised increased price but @entity60 will get only us $ 4.2 with the difference being deposited in an escrow account			0
@entity60 will get the higher rates if it is legally able to prove that it did not deliberately cut production and output fall was a result of geological reasons as it claims			0
@entity20 said that the @entity29 had also cleared the direct benefit transfer ( @entity119 ) scheme for @entity121 in which cash subsidy will be directly transferred to the bank accounts of consumers			1
earlier the scheme was linked with the @entity128 numbers			0
the finance minister said 6.02 crore accounts have been opened so far under the @entity131 , and the new scheme to transfer cash subsidy to the consumers would start from november 10 .			1

diesel price cut and linked to international market
approves raising of natural gas price from november 1
@entity121 subsidy in cash *toreach* consumers directly
