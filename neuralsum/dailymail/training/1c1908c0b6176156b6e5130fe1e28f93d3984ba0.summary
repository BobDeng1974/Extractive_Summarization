it might be gaining popularity among retailers , but @entity4 ’s reputation as a secure digital currency has taken a hit in recent months			1
only last week , up to two million @entity8 computers were compromised after hackers infected them with malware from adverts on @entity12			1
in a well - timed move , @entity14 - based @entity13 has today launched the world ’s first insured @entity4 storage service in the @entity18			1
@entity14 - based @entity13 has today launched the world ¿ s first insured @entity4 storage service in the @entity18 named @entity21 , the service claims to use ‘ deep cold storage ’ techniques to secure the digital currency			1
deep cold storage refers to storage techniques where both strong encryption and secure physical locations are used			1
a simple example of deep cold storage is opening a safety deposit box and putting a usb stick containing an encrypted wallet file in it			1
‘ securing your @entity4 involves implementing advanced encryption and even then you are still at risk of losing them , ’ said @entity33 , co-founder of @entity13			1
@entity4 is a distributed peer - to - peer digital currency that functions without any central authority , such as the @entity40 @entity4 is a distributed peer - to - peer digital currency that functions without any central authority , such as the @entity40			2
the currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers			0
@entity4 can be bought with near anonymity , which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy			0
but critics say that also makes @entity4 a magnet for drug transactions , money - laundering and other illegal activities			2
a @entity4 investor , @entity56 @entity55 , recently made more than half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £ 17 of currency four years ago			1
the current price of @entity4 is $ 840 ( £ 511 )			0
however , its value rose to over $ 1000 ( £ 613 ) last year			0
the dramatic rise has left many early - adopters with digital wallets worth millions of pounds sitting on their hard drives			0
it has also prompted increasingly sophisticated techniques from cyber criminals hoping to ‘ mine ’ @entity4			2
for instance , the security breach on the @entity12 homepage last week used malware infected adverts to make computers into @entity4 slaves			1
other than a slow computer , those infected with the maleware were unaware that their machines were being used to mine @entity4			2
experts estimate that these criminal networks generated as much as $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) each day over the four day period the malware was active			0
@entity83 is the underwriter for the @entity21 service which charges a flat fee of two per cent of the value of a user 's deposit			0
this means if you want to store £ 10,000 worth of coins , it will cost £ 16.67 per month			0
the company added that it has seen some demand for the storage of other crypto - currencies , including as litecoin , and is currently looking into expanding the service			0
in november , @entity98 revealed he had lost 7,500 @entity4 when he unintentionally threw away the hard drive they were stored on			0
but he is now ruing his decision – after he realised his stash would now be worth £ 5 million			0
the @entity4 , that could make him a millionaire , are now buried under four feet of rubbish and mud in a landfill site			0
as @entity4 ’s value continues to rise , hackers have found increasingly sophisticated ways to illegally ‘ mine ’ the virtual currency			1
now a new method has been uncovered which uses malware infected adverts on @entity12 to make computers @entity4 slaves			1
@entity12 has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts now believe as many as two million @entity8 users could have been affected			2
in this recent attack , the hackers used malware to exploit something known as ‘ @entity4 mining ’			1
the mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million @entity4 hidden across an internet - based network , which are expected to all be found by 2040			1
to unearth @entity4 , computers have to solve the complex processor - intensive equations which hold them			2
the more powerful the machine the better it is at solving the riddle			0
@entity4 mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to collect the virtual currency , without using their own high - powered computers			1
other than a slow computer , those infected with the maleware be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ‘ bitnet ’			2
experts estimate that these criminal networks could be generating as much as $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) each day .			0

@entity14 - based @entity13 will use ‘ deep cold storage ’ to secure the currency
the technique uses both strong encryption and secure physical locations
the move comes after news that two million computers were last week made into ' @entity4 slaves ' after being infected by @entity12 malware
