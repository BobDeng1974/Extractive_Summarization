a woman has been found guilty of murdering her baby who she mistakenly believed had dwarfism and did not fit in with her ' obsession with perfection '			1
the six - month - old baby girl was discovered by paramedics floating face down in the bathtub of her home in @entity11 's inner west , on november 18 , 2010			1
the @entity11 mother , who can not be identified , was deemed unfit to stand trial and had faced a special hearing earlier in the @entity15 this month			2
but in a marathon judgment handed down today , justice @entity16 found that although the mother was clearly suffering some disturbance of the mind at the time of the girl 's death , he said it was not at a level that stopped her functioning			2
instead , he found she had murdered the baby girl by intentionally drowning her			1
a @entity11 woman has been found guilty of murdering her baby who she mistakenly believed had dwarfism ( file picture ) describing the 39 - year - old as a mother ' obsessed with perfection ' , the court heard she had raised concerns with doctors soon after the girl 's birth about skin tags on her ears			1
noticing some possible limb shortening , the pediatrician tested for achondroplasia , the medical term for dwarfism			0
the tests came back negative			0
despite further testing and repeated assurances by doctors over the following months that the girl was healthy and ' normal ' , the mother became increasingly anxious that she was ' seeing the signs of a dwarf '			1
to friends , the mother confided she ' did n't want her perfect husband and perfect life ' to be ruined by the baby and that it was likely the girl would need ' head surgery '			2
two days before the murder , she told a friend she wanted to be ' rid ' of her baby by jumping off a cliff with her or ' throwing her in a bin '			0
the court heard she raised concerns with doctors about the baby 's skin but tests revealed she was healthy ( file picture ) justice @entity16 said those statements , in combination with a raft of other circumstantial evidence , had led him to dismiss the mother 's claim her baby had fallen out of her bath seat into the water and drowned in a ' tragic accident '			1
he also dismissed the alternative partial defences to murder of infanticide and substantial impairment			0
the woman , who at times raised her arms in objection and at other points cried throughout the judgment , remained expressionless as her bail was revoked and she was taken into custody for the first time			0
the matter was referred to the @entity97 and will return to court later this month to discuss what the mother 's limiting term should be			0
a limiting term represents the maximum amount of time she could be detained .			0
