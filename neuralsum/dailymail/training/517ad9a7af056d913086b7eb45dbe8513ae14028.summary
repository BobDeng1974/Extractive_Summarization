by @entity0 researchers have claimed that allowing employees to surf the internet at work could boost their productivity			2
the results suggest that for those with jobs that do n't involve sitting at a desk , a quick jaunt online can make them more productive			1
workers who took the online breaks had a quick chance to unwind , but the researchers warned that if surfing was undisciplined it could result in ‘ cyberloafing ’ - those who spend too much time doing other things online when they should be working			1

however spending too much time online turns people into cyberloafers			1
this means they spend too much time doing other things online when they should be working the study 's lead author dr @entity34 of the @entity36 at the @entity22 said : ‘ employees reported benefits on going online to balance their work and personal responsibilities , such as checking on their children			1
’ using phones and tablets to access work email outside office hours can dramatically increase stress levels , researchers have warned			0
the research could have major implications for those who work away from the office			0
however , those who worked remotely also rated the quality of their lives as being better than those stuck in an office			0
a @entity60 poll found nearly half of workers who ' frequently email for work outside of normal working hours ' reported experiencing ' a lot of ' stress , compared with the 36 per cent who experienced stress but never emailed out of work			0
‘ after reassuring themselves about their children , they were better able to focus on their work			0
’ dr @entity34 added that people going online for industry news or research saw it as part of their professional development and improved satisfaction at work			2
he suggested this was perhaps because of the freedom to be able to occasionally check in on their personal life			0
the researchers added that they found three consequences to these breaks : ‘ momentary recovery , learning , and satisfaction			0
’ however , the potential benefits of the online breaks should come with a warning to bosses , according to the study			1
researchers suggested that if taken in an ‘ undisciplined manner , ’ these breaks could turn into cyberloafing , resulting in the excessive loss of time and productivity			2
dr @entity34 said that previous research has focused on breaks during off - job hours such as evening , weekend and vacation periods , or on traditional ‘ offline ’ breaks taken during working hours , such as lunch or coffee breaks			2
however , the team decided to research online breaks during work hours and held extensive interviews with 33 professionals from a variety of industries and occupations about the practice			1
the research shows that the tactic is most effective for people with active jobs			1
people taking online breaks with desk jobs were less productive , however ( stock image shown ) the researchers examined several factors including triggers that prompt online work breaks , conditions that lead to taking an online break rather than an offline break , different online break activities and consequences of these actions			1
the study discovered that workers engaged in online work breaks when they reported a high need for recovery , such as feeling tired from an intense work period , or recovering from a reported significant loss of physical or emotional energy			0
triggers also included breaking monotony or boredom , checking on demands at home and other personal demands , or emotional work - related events that triggered anger or frustration , according to the researchers			0
the scientists said that workers whose jobs required extensive computer time or sitting at a desk for prolonged periods were less likely to find online breaks rejuvenating , compared to jobs that required a good deal of physical activity or a lot of face - to - face interaction , when employees relax with some ‘ alone time ’ online			1
the research , which is to be presented to the @entity168 in @entity169 , found that the company policy affected employees ’ likelihood of taking these breaks			0
some of the employees reported that their workplace had strict policies on the personal use of workplace computers			0
dr @entity34 added that older workers who had spent years in the workplace previous to the birth of the internet frowned on online breaks , stating that they were being ‘ paid to work			2
