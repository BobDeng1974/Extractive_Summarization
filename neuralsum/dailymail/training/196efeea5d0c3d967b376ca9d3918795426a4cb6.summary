evidence for a giant glacier that once existed in the deepest canyon on @entity3 has been found			1
a type of mineral 1.2 miles ( 2km ) up the side of the canyon wall suggests that a huge glacier once passed through			1
while the idea of a glacier is controversial , the scientists say such a theory is the best explanation for their latest findings			0
research led by dr @entity16 from @entity17 in @entity18 suggests that part of @entity20 may have played host to an ancient glacier			1
evidence comes from a mineral called jarosite found half way up the cliff wall ( shown ) , which may have been the top of an ancient glacier that has long since disappeared the research was led by dr @entity16 from the @entity30 at @entity17 in @entity18			1
evidence for the glacier comes in the form of the mineral jarosite being spotted in the wall , a sulphate that forms in highly acidic water with low temperatures - such as the top of a glacier on @entity3			1
while evidence for glaciers on @entity3 has been spotted before , this is one of the first times evidence for one has been found in @entity20			1
named after the @entity44 @entity3 orbiter of 1971/1972 , @entity20 is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system			1
at more than 2,500 miles ( 4,000 km ) long , 120 miles ( 200 km ) wide and up to x miles ( 7 km ) deep it is among the largest canyon in the solar system			2
it is located on the @entity3 equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet ’s circumference			1
if it was located on @entity58 it would stretch across the entire @entity59			0
one of its largest sections is the @entity62 , which is about 938km long , in which this latest discovery was made			2
several theories for its formation have been proposed , including water erosion and a tectonic ‘ crack ’ in the @entity3 crust			2
the canyon itself is thought to have been formed by tectonic stresses , but dr @entity16 tells @entity75 the best explanation for the discovery of jarosite here is that a glacier once filled half the canyon			1
the jarosite was found in a thin layer 330ft ( 100 metres ) along part of the cliff wall , suggesting it was once the boundary of the top of an ancient glacier			1
‘ the canyon wall starts at about zero metres elevation and descends to about -4,000 metres [ 2.5 miles ] , ’ she explains			2
‘ we see the jarosite at -1,900 to -2,000 metres [ 1.18 to 1.24 miles ] , so about half - way down the canyon wall			1
’ she continued : ‘ we found [ jarosite ] in a few places on @entity3 before , but the exciting thing here is we found it half way up a 3 - mile [ 4.8km ] high cliff face in the @entity102			1
‘ all previous jarosite deposits have been found in low - lying deposit areas , places where water would cool			1
’ @entity107 usually forms in wet and acidic locations like rivers and groundwater , but dr @entity16 explains that could n’t have happened here			0
' it would have required half the valley to be filled with water , which would have left huge indicators and evidence that there had been water there , and there ’s no evidence , ' she says			2
‘ so we think the only viable way you see jarosite is if there was a glacier			0
’ if true , this would be among the first mineralogical evidence for glaciers in the @entity62 - one of the largest portions of @entity20			1
the mineral known as jarosite must have been desposited by highly acidic water at low temperature - and a glacier is the best explanation			1
dr @entity16 says it could not have been a regular water flow such as a river as it would have had to fill half the deep canyon ( @entity62 shown in image ) the discovery was made using instruments on @entity143 's @entity142 ( left ) and @entity145 's @entity144 ( right ) spacecraft			1
further observations in future will be used to verify the findings on average , @entity3 lies 141.6 million miles ( 227.9 million km ) from the sun. with a diameter of 4,222 miles ( 6,795km ) , it ’s around half the size of the @entity58 and has an average temperature of -65 ° @entity155 )			1
the gravity there is much weaker than on @entity58 - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			0
the atmosphere is also desperately thin - one per cent of @entity58 ’s pressure - and 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			0
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain – @entity165 , a dead volcano			0
this measures 335 miles ( 540 km ) across and rises to a height of 88,000ft ( 26,800 metres ) , which is almost three times higher than @entity170			0
@entity3 has two natural satellites - the moons @entity173 and @entity174			2
the planet 's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			1
@entity3 has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps			0
if they melted , the resulting liquid would cover the whole planet in water 36ft ( 11 metres ) deep , according to @entity143			0
the team used data from two spacecraft , @entity143 's @entity142 and @entity145 's @entity144 , to make the findings			0
dr @entity16 admits the theory that this canyon played host to a glacier remains controversial in the scientific community			0
but she says other explanations for this feature just do n’t make sense			0
one possibility was that this jarosite came from a water table but , as it is not near the surface , dr @entity16 says this would require the water table to be slanted , ‘ which is a very strange thing for a water table to do			0
’ she continues : ‘ if it was a glacier , it would be the top point of the glacier			0
' the mineral jarosite would form at the top of the glacier , where the ice melts , and be deposited on the cliff wall			1
one other theory is that this jarosite was deposited by an acid fog			0
acid fog is essentially water vapour that is highly enriched in sulphur , which can be released during volcanic emissions			0
however , with no volcanic vents nearby , this theory looks unlikely			0
‘ we are continuing to map @entity62 , and will map the surrounding wall surfaces to see if we can find this same mineral elsewhere , ’ dr @entity16 adds			2
‘ it ’s very exciting			0
’ named after the @entity44 @entity3 orbiter of 1971/1972 , @entity20 is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system			2
it is located on the @entity3 equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet ’s circumference			2
this image of @entity20 was taken by @entity143 's @entity238 in june 1992			0

study suggests part of @entity3 ' @entity20 had an ancient glacier
this giant canyon stretches across a quarter of the red planet 's surface
evidence for an glacier comes from a mineral found half way up the cliff wall on one of the canyon 's largest segments called @entity62
the mineral known as jarosite must have been deposited by highly acidic water at low temperature - and a glacier is the best explanation
this would have meant the ancient river was 1.2 miles ( 2km ) deep
