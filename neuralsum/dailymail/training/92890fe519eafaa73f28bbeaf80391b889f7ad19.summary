prosecutor @entity33 also told jurors that he habitually carried a knife and was very reclusive			1
he said : ' to those who came in contact with him , he seemed to be a very quiet , shy individual , something of a loner			0
' however , he owned and habitually carried a range of weapons , including knives , about which he had an obsessive interest			1
' he said that @entity9 ' savagely killed ' @entity5 inside a dark alleyway on january 18 , 1993 - just four days after her birthday - because he got a ' warped pleasure ' out of her murder			1
he told jurors : ' her assailant had stabbed her no less than nine times in what can only be described as a frenzied and remorseless attack by someone having nothing less than the intention of killing her			2
' make no mistake , this was a killing for the sake of killing , carried out by a ruthless and predatory armed killer , who attacked his chosen victim rapidly and stealthily , allowing her no time for defence or escape , and who fled the scene just as efficiently as he had arrived			0
' @entity9 was photographed at @entity5 's funeral just a month after he allegedly killed her			1
the court heard that he carried out similarly brutal knife attacks on other women - and plotted more			1
he also allegedly bragged about his attacks in journals which contained details of his ' @entity76 '			0

@entity9 was just 20 when he attempted to murder his first victim ' by strangling her , and by stabbing her several times in the back , and he had attempted to rape her			1
' she had been lucky to survive , ' said mr @entity90			0
five years later he allegedly pounced on @entity5 , who he knew through family ties with the local @entity93 club			2
' the killing of @entity5 did not end his spree , because two and a half years later in october 1995 , when he was 27 , the defendant attacked and stabbed another local woman some 360 metres as the crow flies from where the prosecution say he attacked @entity5			2
' he said that , like the schoolgirl 's murder two years before , the attack was ' seemingly motiveless ' and it was also ' a rare and exceptional event '			2
@entity9 pleaded guilty in 1996 to these other attacks			2
flowers laid at the scene of @entity5 's murder off @entity108 ( @entity109 ) in @entity23 , @entity24 while in prison for the other two attacks he ' befriended a fellow prisoner to whom he confessed he was @entity5 's killer ' , mr @entity90 added			1
jurors heard that @entity5 had been taking her mock gcse exams around the time of her ' dreadful murder '			1
that evening , she left home at about 6pm to visit her friend @entity118 who lived less than a mile away , and who she was going to talk to about college choices			0
but in a decision ' that was to cost @entity5 her life ' she took a quick detour to buy some cigarettes			2
she never arrived and was stabbed to death in an alleyway before staggering out bleeding onto @entity108 in the small town of @entity23			0
mr @entity90 said : ' people thought she had been run over by a car but they soon came to realise that she had been the victim of a terrible crime			0

' @entity135 and another man , @entity136 , were the first on the scene that evening			0
mr @entity139 said : ' she was on her knees facing [ a ] low wall with her left arm draped over it			0

' mr @entity136 thought the person had been a victim of a road accident			0
when he saw that she was covered in blood he ran across the road to summon and ambulance			0
' pathologist reports at the time varied in whether @entity155 had been attacked from behind or in front and detectives remain unsure of how @entity9 allegedly pounced			2
mr @entity90 said : ' what may never be known , except to the man who attacked her , is whether @entity5 had entered the alleyway first and was then stabbed , or whether her attacker had dragged her in there and then stabbed her to death			2
' whichever it was , this was a brazen attack by someone with the confidence and resourcefulness to carry out a rapid , frenzied and ultimately murderous attack just off a busy main road			0
' the court heard that @entity172 launched a massive and long - running investigation to hunt down @entity5 's killer , but @entity9 has always denied her murder			1

mr @entity90 said that in those notes ' he had written about the attack in 1988 as well as other planned attacks that he had not completed '			0
he said @entity5 's killing was an ' entirely motiveless attack ' , and @entity9 got a sick thrill out of her killing			1
he said : ' there was no sexual interference and nothing was stolen from her			0
' but to her killer @entity5 was a target for a completely senseless slaughter of an innocent young teenage girl , you might think for no better reason than the warped pleasure he derived from attacking a lone woman and the ultimate power and control it gave him			1
' at the time of the alleged killing he lived with longterm girlfriend @entity213 , who married in him in prison in 1997 but later divorced , and has since died			0
mr @entity90 said : ' they went out together and she found him controlling , but despite this the relationship continued and eventually they lived together			0
