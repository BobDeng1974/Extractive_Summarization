by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 17:50 est , 26 july 2013 ' embarrassed ' : archbishop of @entity3 @entity2 has vowed to clean up the @entity5 's portfolio the archbishop of @entity7 is to review the @entity5 ’s investment strategy , after ‘ very embarrassing ’ revelations that it has holdings in firms that profit from payday lending , and may have invested in companies involved in arms dealing and pornography			1
the most reverend @entity2 said he was irritated and embarrassed to discover that the @entity5 has indirectly invested in payday loan firm @entity18 , which earlier this week he vowed to drive out of business			1
it also emerged that the @entity5 ’s ‘ ethical ’ rules allow it to invest its £ 5.2billion assets in firms involved in gambling , tobacco and alcohol			1
even firms involved in arms dealing , pornography and human cloning are not barred from receiving @entity5 investment			1
the archbishop confirmed the @entity5 had a £ 75,000 stake in @entity35 venture capital firm @entity34 , which injected capital into @entity18 in 2009			1
the disclosure came less than 48 hours after he revealed he had told @entity18 chief executive @entity38 that he wanted to drive the firm ‘ out of business ’ by supporting not - for - profit credit unions			1
the archbishop said : ‘ what ’s clear is that this is an embarrassment			0
' we think that the payday lenders charge vastly excessive amounts for the loans they make , that there is a totally inadequate range of choice for consumers in deprived areas			0
‘ it should n’t happen			0
it ’s very embarrassing , but these things do happen			0
we have to find out why and make sure it does n’t happen again			0
’ @entity58 said an independent inquiry would be launched into the @entity18 investment to uncover how ‘ this serious inconsistency ’ occurred			1
the @entity5 ’s investment portfolio is managed by the @entity63 , who are not directly controlled by the archbishop			2
under the @entity68 ’ rules , they can invest in firms who make up to 25 per cent of their money through payday lending or gambling , up to 10 per cent through arms dealing or up to 3 per cent from pornography			1
irritated : @entity2 was irritated to find that the @entity5 had invested indirectly in payday loan firm @entity18 , which he had vowed to drive out of business earlier this week the archbishop said these thresholds should be revisited , adding that the @entity5 ‘ should n’t be investing in @entity18 ’			1
he said : ‘ i think we have to review these levels and make sure we are consistent between what we ’re saying and what we ’re doing			0
’ @entity85 , spokesman for the campaign group @entity86 , said revelations about the @entity5 ’s investments were ‘ extraordinary ’			2
' i think we have to review these levels and make sure we are consistent between what we ’re saying and what we ’re doing			0
' archbishop @entity2 mr @entity85 said : ‘ it is complicated			0
of course , no one is expecting @entity2 to have every figure from the church accounts in his head			2
‘ but there is this issue of percentages			0
the @entity5 can invest in a company that sells arms , as long as arms are less than 10 per cent of its business – which in the case of a big company can still be millions of pounds			2
‘ i think it ’s a problem , and with payday lenders it is n’t even 10 per cent , it ’s 25 per cent – a sizeable chunk of any company ’s business			0
’ but the @entity2 said it was a ‘ complex ’ issue , and warned it was difficult to invest in firms that had no controversial operations , such as hotel chains who made money from pornography sold in their rooms			1
the @entity5 needed to be realistic in accepting that the ‘ complexity of the markets means that a lot of companies get involved in things at a very small level , indirectly ’			2
he said it was a ‘ valid question ’ whether a ‘ little sin ’ was tolerable , adding : ‘ @entity131 is a bad thing by definition			0
just for the record , i ’m not in favour of sin			0
’ the archbishop revealed that the @entity5 was examining whether it could invest directly in rivals to firms such as @entity18 , which have been blamed for driving desperate families into debt by charging annual interest rates of more than 5,500 per cent a year on loans .			1

@entity2 to review @entity5 's investment strategy
it emerged earlier this week that @entity5 invests indirectly in loan firm @entity18
church rules allow it to invest in gambling , tobacco and alcohol firms
