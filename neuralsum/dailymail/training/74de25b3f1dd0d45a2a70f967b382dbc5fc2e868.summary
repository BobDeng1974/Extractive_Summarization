many animal lovers are familiar with the nuisance caused by cats interrupting their work by climbing across their papers or computer keyboard			2
but this is not a new phenomenon , as this extraordinary photograph of a medieval manuscript proves			0
the 15th - century book is marked with four pawprints , which appear to be the result of a cat jumping on to the paper			1
age - old problem : this 15th - century manuscript has been damaged by a cat walking across it the animal also seems to have stepped in ink of some kind , leading to the exceptional clarity of the marks even five or more centuries later			1
the picture was taken by @entity26 , a scholar working in the @entity27 in @entity28			1
after he sent it to historian @entity32 last year , the image took on a life of its own as web users shared it as a poignant proof of how cats have been beloved pets for half a millennium			0
the book is part of the ' @entity41 ' , an official record of the activities of the @entity45 government throughout the @entity46			1
@entity47 : the animal had apparently just stepped in a pot of ink before jumping onto the book document : the book contains medieval records from the city of @entity45 , now in @entity28 these days , if a government document was disfigured by an animal it would probably be destroyed and replaced - but back then writing was such an elaborate and expensive exercise that the book could not be wasted			1
this week , mr @entity26 went online to give his own interpretation of the image 's success			0
' you can almost picture the writer shooing the cat in a panicky fashion while trying to remove it from his desk , ' he wrote			0
unique : the mishap is an extraordinary glimpse into the daily life of a scribe in the @entity46 ' despite his best efforts the damage was already complete and there was nothing else he could have done but turn a new leaf and continue his job			2
in that way this little episode was " archived " in history			0
' this is not the only incident of a cat vandalising a manuscript - one item in the @entity89 archive features a page left half - blank because an animal had urinated on it when it was left out overnight			2
cats were often allowed to live in monasteries and scriptoria because they chased away mice which might otherwise nibble at the manuscripts .			0

unique document comes from @entity27 in @entity28
