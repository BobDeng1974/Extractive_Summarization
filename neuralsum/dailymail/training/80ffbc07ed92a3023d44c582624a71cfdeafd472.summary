by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:34 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:46 est , 30 december 2013 a crackdown on taxpayers ’ money being used to fund union work by civil servants is today exposed as a dismal failure			1
the cost of ‘ facility time ’ in @entity11 shot up by almost a third in two years , according to official figures			1
what has been dubbed a ‘ scandalous subsidy ’ increased from £ 18.3million in 2010/11 to almost £ 23.6million in 2012/13 - a rise of 29 per cent			1
limits : fifteen government departments failed to meet a cap set by the @entity20 fifteen government departments failed to meet the cap set by the @entity20 of 0.1 per cent of the wages bill being spent on union time			1
facility time allows trade union representatives to take paid time off to participate in union duties			1
but critics say it means taxpayers are providing unions with a huge activist base to support strikes and freeing up resources for political campaigns			2
before the curb was introduced in 2010 , there was no monitoring of the subsidy among civil servants – with some working full time on union duties and others even receiving promotions without actually doing the job for which they were paid			0
@entity45 mp @entity44 , who uncovered the figures under freedom of information laws , said : ‘ with so many facing the disruption of strikes led by militant union leaders , taxpayers will be alarmed to learn their subsidy to the unions has shot up by almost a third in two years			1
' having pledged to cut the millions of pounds of public money siphoned off for union business , it is vital that the government delivers on its promise			0
’ uncovered : @entity44 mp found out the figures using freedom of information laws the figures are based on data from 16 @entity11 departments and 37 executive agencies			1
as 20 departments were sent requests , the estimate is almost certainly below the actual spend on facility time			1
the biggest spenders were the @entity73 , which charged taxpayers almost £ 6.5million			1
the @entity75 spent £ 6.1million , while the @entity76 topped £ 3.3million			0
the @entity75 also saw one of the biggest rises in spending over the two years , with a £ 5.68million or 1,350 per cent increase			2
@entity73 expenditure leaped by £ 726,610 - 13.4 per cent - while spending by the @entity83 rose by £ 646,786 ( 25.9 per cent )			2
at present , 0.26 per cent of the @entity85 ’s pay bill is spent on union work			0
the equivalent figure is just 0.04 per cent in the private sector			0
the @entity89 ’ @entity91 campaign group has led calls for a cut in the subsidy , which it claims is actually worth £ 80million to unions across the entire public sector			2
but the @entity98 said facility time saves taxpayers ’ money by preventing conflicts and tribunals , and promoting training and development			1
the @entity106 says the public and private sector save £ 2million a day			0
a @entity20 spokesman said newer figures will show costs falling ‘ dramatically ’			2
a @entity20 spokesman said : ' before 2010 there was no monitoring of taxpayer - funded union representatives and too many civil servants worked full time on nothing but union work			0
' some civil servants were even promoted without doing the job for which they were employed			0
that is not fair to the taxpayer or other civil servants			0
' our policy now limits the amount of time civil servants can spend on trade union work			0
' we will be looking closely at this data as it seems totally at odds with the recent numbers reported by departments			0
' because there was no systematic monitoring before the last election , in some cases reported numbers have seemed to increase but what actually happened is that departments more accurately monitored their workforces as a result of our policy			0
' our newest figures , which will be published shortly , show the cost of facility time has fallen dramatically			1
