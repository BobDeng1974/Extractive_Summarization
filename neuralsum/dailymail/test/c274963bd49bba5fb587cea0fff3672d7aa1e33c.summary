this is the brilliant young honors student who was brutalized by @entity2 star @entity2 in a sadistic fraternity hazing ritual			2
seen here for the first time , @entity4 was beaten with a paddle , dragged around a room by his genitals and had his pants set on fire			0
@entity13 winner @entity12 was one of seven @entity15 brothers who tormented and humiliated @entity4 when he was a young pledge at the @entity17			1
the young man was hit so hard during the warped 1990 initiation that he suffered a fractured spine and nearly lost a kidney			1
but after he graduated high school in 1988 he entered the @entity17 and pledged the @entity15 fraternity			1
that 's when he met @entity2 and his hazing hell began football hero : @entity2 the year he graduated from @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 and one year before his admission to @entity17 partners : @entity2 and @entity37 attended the " girls " season four series premiere after party at @entity41 on january 5 , 2015 in @entity42			1
@entity4 subsequently withdrew from the university and sought counselling to cope with the shameful episode which resulted in a police inquiry and the fraternity chapter being disbanded			0
@entity12 , a sophomore , was identified as a ringleader and arrested in 1993 , long before he became one of @entity52 's most recognizable actors playing boozy advertising exec @entity53			2
an assault charge was dismissed , however , and he completed a period of probation instead of receiving a conviction for hazing			0
our exclusive photos show @entity4 in his senior year at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity26 where he excelled in his studies , played for the basketball team and was treasurer of the school council			0
despite his ordeal at @entity17 he was able to resume his education at @entity72 , before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine			0
the 45 - year - old lives now with his wife @entity77 , 41 , and their two children in @entity26 , where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury			1
he has declined to speak publicly about his ordeal but the harrowing details are laid bare in court documents dating back more than two decades			0
in a 1991 interview transcript obtained by @entity89 , @entity4 tells investigators with the @entity92 's @entity91 how he suffered ' repeated beatings and assaults ' at the hands of @entity15 ' actives '			1
he also alleged that he and his fellow pledges were subjected to ' repeated confinements ' in a series of tiny compartments carved into the frat building 's foundations - including ' the pit ' , ' the hole ' and ' the grave '			1
@entity4 listed @entity12 as one of his chief tormentors , recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six - page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the ' bulls * * * list ' when @entity4 forgot the last of @entity12 's nicknames , which included @entity115 and @entity116 , he recalled how @entity12 got " mad , i mean really mad ' @entity4 told officials the worst of the hazing happened in the early hours of november 10 , 1990 when he was summoned to the house and warned by @entity12 : ' it â€™s going to be a long night			1
' the junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity			0
@entity24 in his 1988 high school yearbook from @entity63 in @entity64 he listed @entity12 as one of his chief tormentors , recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six - page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the ' bulls * * * list '			1
when he forgot the last of @entity12 's nicknames , which included @entity115 and @entity116 , he recalled how @entity12 got " mad , i mean really mad '			2
@entity12 and his frat cohorts ' retribution was to spank @entity4 repeatedly with a paddle			1
' i 'm hurting bad , i mean being hit right where the kidney is , it 's killing me , ' @entity4 told his interviewers			1
@entity12 and another fraternity member then lifted @entity4 up by his underwear , pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion			2
' i do n't know how far underwear stretches , i do n't know how far i was off the ground , ' he recalled			0
' i was hurting really bad and i remember i was looking up at the ceiling and i was gritting my teeth and squinting my eyes ... it was sawing and it was hurting			0
' @entity4 told investigators how @entity12 then led him to ' the pit ' where he ordered him to do press - ups and pushed his face into the ground			1
the distraught pledge felt someone , possibly @entity12 , standing on his back			2
@entity12 is then supposed to have set fire to @entity4 ' pants and refused to let him pat the flames down , instead making him blow them out			2
finally he was led upstairs to the ' party room ' when @entity12 hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his testicles and pulled him around the room ' for at least a minute '			0
suave @entity53 has had to his own dark past on the hit show @entity172			2
but for @entity2 , ' the hazing incident was an isolated incident , ' said a friend despite his ordeal , @entity4 was able to resume his education at @entity72 , before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine			1
the 45 - year - old lives now with his wife in @entity26 , where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury in the wake of the hazing , @entity4 fled to a friend 's room to escape further brutality before eventually showing his bruises to fellow students			1
he later claimed to have suffered nerve damage to his ribs , kidney spasms and a lineal spinal fracture @entity4 ' horrified mother @entity199 reported it to @entity17 authorities , triggering a police investigation and prompting the fraternity to permanently close its @entity17 chapter			1
university records show @entity12 , now aged 44 , left the college at the end of the semester without a degree and returned to his hometown in @entity34			0
@entity4 later launched a lawsuit against @entity15 seeking ' unspecified actual and exemplary damages for willful and wanton misconduct '			2
it was dismissed with the agreement of both parties , however , in 1993 , possibly signalling that an out - of - court settlement had been reached			0
that same year @entity12 was arrested by the @entity218 but court documents show that in 1995 he received deferred adjudication , allowing him to avoid a criminal conviction by serving a period of probation			0
his hazing shame went unreported for two decades until @entity225 broke the story last week in the midst of the final @entity172 season airing on @entity228			2
@entity12 is yet to comment but a friend told @entity225 : ' the hazing incident was an isolated incident in @entity2 's life			1
since then , he 's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person			0
