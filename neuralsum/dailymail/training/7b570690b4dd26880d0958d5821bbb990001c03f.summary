by @entity0 the end of the @entity3 chemical weapons crisis and the stronger pound sent wholesale prices tumbling with soaring energy bills and the cost of living rising , there is finally some good news for @entity11 households - petrol prices have tumbled			1
drivers are paying the lowest average price for petrol in more than two and a half years , according to a study			2
the @entity16 found the average pump price of petrol fell from 132.16p per litre last month to 130.44p			1
it had risen to a high of 138.38p in the second week of september before the end of the @entity3 chemical weapons crisis and the stronger pound sent wholesale prices tumbling , the motoring organisation said			1
the cheapest price for supermarket petrol in built - up areas ranges from 126.7p in towns with strong competition to 131.9p in those without , usually small market and coastal towns like @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			0
last week , however , some non-supermarket fuel stations in @entity38 's @entity36 and @entity37 areas were able to sell petrol at 124.9p a litre			2
the cost of diesel also continued to fall , down from an average of 139.12p a litre in mid october to 137.78p now			1
it had also hit a late summer high in the second week of september , reaching 142.88p			0
at about 7p a litre more expensive than petrol , diesel 's differential is largely consistent with the november price gap over the past two years			1
a family with two petrol cars was spending the equivalent of £ 252.54 a month on fuel in september , now it 's £ 238.05 @entity57 , the @entity16 's president , said : ' on average , 28 per cent of @entity16 members buy a set amount of fuel each time they go to a petrol station			2
' this rises to 40 per cent for younger drivers and 44 per cent for lower - income ones			0
in september , a £ 30 spend bought them 21.7 litres and now it buys them 23 - a boost equal to a free 10 - mile round trip to work			0
' a family with two petrol cars was spending the equivalent of £ 252.54 a month on fuel in september , now it 's £ 238.05			0
' a company with 100 @entity76 was spending typically £ 10,000 to fill them up with diesel in mid september , now it 's around £ 9,640			1
' last week , it was officially recognised that lower pump prices helped to bring inflation down to 2.2 per cent			0
' you can not understate the importance of lower pump prices			0
that is why , when the independent retailers say they would get significant savings from delaying the payment of fuel tax , the @entity16 wholeheartedly supports the move if it helps the remote rural and other small petrol stations to survive			0
' he added : ' but in the many towns where our members and other drivers complain about pump prices being 5p a litre higher than a few miles up the road , extra relief for the retailers should be reciprocated with fairer pump prices			1
