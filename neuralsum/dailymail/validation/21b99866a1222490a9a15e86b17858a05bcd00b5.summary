as well as the players from @entity25 , their supporters were unimpressed with the mistake and boos rang out across the field			1
@entity4 is home to one of the largest @entity1 communities outside of @entity40 and their followers outnumbered the @entity43 support			2

' the organization understands and regrets the unfortunate incident with the @entity25 national anthem at yesterday 's friendly match at @entity54 , ' it said			1
confusion : the stunned players look at each other as they try to figure out what is going on having listened to the wrong anthem , the @entity59 head for the handshakes with their heads down ' @entity63 takes full responsibility for this honest mistake and values all feedback from loyal fans , the @entity59 community and partners affected by this incident			0
' this was not done with malicious intentions and the company will be sure to address this with the right parties to ensure it does n't happen again			0
' but the damage was already done			0
