she ca n't sit up on her own and she certainly is n't swinging fearlessly through the trees just yet			0
but right now the only thing @entity4 the baby orangutan wants is a mum			2
she was abandoned at birth six weeks ago when her 11 - year - old mother rejected her			1
now , like any young orphan , she is looking for a grown - up to adopt her			0
in different circumstances , @entity4 would be spending her formative months clinging to her mother and learning the ways of an orangutan tribe			1
like any baby , she needs her nappy changing , suckles from a bottle and makes squeaking noises when she wants attention			0
she even has a snuggly blanket to comfort her			0
but it 's no substitute for a mother 's love			0
four keepers at @entity19 in @entity20 take it in turns to look after her so she does n't get attached to just one of them			1
soon , however , she will be introduced to adult orangutans in the hope that she can find a family – and someone to ape			1
@entity4 was moved on monday to the sanctuary from @entity47 , where she was born on january 12 weighing just 4lb			2
she slept for most of the 17 - hour journey , a feat few children could manage without whining : ' are we nearly there yet ? ' rehomed : @entity4 was moved to @entity19 from @entity47 where she was born on january 12 weighing just 4lb endangered : orangutans are considered the most intelligent of all ape species but some experts believe they could go extinct within 25 years the zoo wanted her to grow up in as natural an environment as possible – and @entity19 already cares for a tribe of 18 orangutans , one of which , it is hoped , will become her stepmother			1
crucially , there is also another orangutan orphan there to play with – @entity69 , a five - month - old whose mother died after giving birth to him at a zoo in @entity74			2
yesterday the pair were said to be bonding perfectly			0
having a big brother to show her the ropes will be a huge advantage in @entity4 's development			2
orangutans are the most intelligent great apes and are critically endangered in their @entity84 homelands – some experts believe the species could be extinct within 25 years			1
@entity19 , set up in 1987 , currently has 250 rescued primates from 20 species ... plus one little girl that just wants to be loved .			0

six - week - old @entity4 rejected by her 11 - year - old mother at birth
she has been cared for by humans who change her nappies and feed her
keepers at @entity19 rotate shifts so she does n't get attached to one
she will soon be introduced to adult orangutans so she can find a family
experts believe the *highly* intelligent *animals* could go extinct in 25 years
