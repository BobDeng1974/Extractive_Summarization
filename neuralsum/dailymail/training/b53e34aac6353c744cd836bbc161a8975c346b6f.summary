as a teenager , @entity0 was taunted by bullies for weighing 27 stone and having to wear a custom - made size 32 school uniform			1
those same tormentors were stunned this year to see that she is now a size 10 , having lost 16st 7lb – more than half her body weight – in just over 12 months			1
miss @entity0 , now 22 and a striking 6ft mother of two , said it was ‘ such an amazing feeling ’ to shock the girls who made fun of her			1
transformed : @entity0 , 22 , has lost 17 stone on the @entity16 weightloss plan ‘ i was verbally and physically bullied for years , all the way through secondary school , ’ she added			1
‘ the whole school had a nickname for me			2
i was known as “ @entity21 ” – because everyone said i was built like the @entity24			0
i had a specially made man ’s blazer , as my mum could n’t buy one big enough for me			2
it was a 50 - inch chest , the same size as a bodybuilder			0
but since i ’ve lost weight , i ’ve seen some of the girls who made my life hell and they did n’t even recognise me			1
‘ it was the best feeling in the world to go over and introduce myself			0
their jaws hit the floor when they realised who i was			0
’ miss @entity0 , from @entity41 in @entity42 , said that although she enjoyed showing off her new size , her main motivation for losing the weight was her children , @entity46 , three , and @entity47 , 15 months			1
then : @entity0 has struggled with her weight from a young age and was bullied at school because of her size now : the school bullies did n't recognise her now she 's a slim size 10 she was horrified when she saw pictures of herself cradling @entity46 after his birth , saying she wanted to ‘ rip them up ’			1
any weight loss was put on hold when she got pregnant again , but after having @entity47 she began the strict @entity16 weight loss plan , which she read about and had cleared by her doctor			0
the diet restricts slimmers to soups and shakes for a period , before slowly reintroducing ‘ real ’ food in a measured way			0
miss @entity0 , who is studying music at the @entity68 , then transformed her diet , swapping dinners of takeaway pizzas and crisps for chicken salads and grilled meat			2
no longer fits : as a size 32 school girl , she had to have a specially - made uniform whereas she used to drink ten cans of the soft drink @entity79 a day , she now has eight glasses of water			1
by her daughter ’s first birthday , she weighed 10st 9lb and could fit into a size 10 party dress			1
miss @entity0 , who has separated from her children ’s father , said : ‘ i ’ve been hugely overweight my whole life and never in a million years did i think i ’d be able to go clothes shopping in a normal shop , let alone buy a size 10			1
' amazing feeling ' : the mother - of - two said she 's delighted she can now be more active with her children ‘ i lost weight so quickly , and once it started coming off it was easy to keep going			1
i used to be so embarrassed to be seen by other people , i ’d avoid going out			0
‘ i did all my shopping online			0
now , i love going shopping – especially for new clothes			0
i love being able to take my baby out for long strolls in her pram and not be out of breath			0
‘ my family and friends even struggle to recognise me in a crowd sometimes			0
’ miss @entity0 said she has now forgiven the bullies			2
‘ they could n’t apologise enough for how they treated me , ’ she said			0
‘ but i lost the weight for me and my children , not for them			2

@entity0 , 22 , from @entity42 , lost more than half her body weight
she 's dropped from 27st , dress size 32 , to 10st 9lb , dress size 10
school bullies who made her life ' hell ' no longer recognise her
