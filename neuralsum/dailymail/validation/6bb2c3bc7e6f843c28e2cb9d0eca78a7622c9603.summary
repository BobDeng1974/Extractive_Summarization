@entity1 to 30 babies and mothers died at a scandal - hit hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors , a damning report is expected to reveal			1
the independent inquiry into baby deaths within @entity10 will show that the scale of the scandal was much worse than previously feared			1
it had been thought that 16 babies and two mothers had died as a result of shambolic care over nearly ten years at a maternity ward within @entity19 in @entity20			1
tragedy : @entity22 was nine days old when he died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics at @entity19 , @entity20 but after highlighting concerns in around 50 cases , investigators are expected to conclude that neglect contributed to even more deaths			1
health officials have tried to cover up their failure to properly investigate poor patient care on the unit			0
despite multiple warnings about failings between 2001 and 2012 , the @entity34 gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010			1
the failure to strike off any nurse , doctor or midwife working at the hospital has enraged victims ’ families			2
concerns were first raised in september 2008 when @entity22 , who was nine days old , died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics			1
his father @entity50 said it was ‘ appalling ’ that nobody has been disciplined for the failings that led to the deaths and described the accountability process as ‘ ridiculously slow ’			2
up to 30 babies and mothers died at @entity19 because of failings by midwives and doctors , a damning report is expected to reveal mr @entity22 said : ‘ it ’s been six years since @entity22 died and we have should been finding out about [ the care failings ] at the time			1
it ’s a sign of how closed and secretive the @entity67 was			0
‘ we were faced with obstacle after obstacle which is an indictment of how the @entity67 was run at the time			0
‘ what happened to protecting mothers and babies ? the timescale is a disgrace			1
’ he said there was no reason why culpable nurse and doctors could not have been held to account before the report was published			0
a number of midwives from the hospital are due to face the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) later this year in relation to deaths at the hospital			1
grief : @entity50 and @entity91 lost their baby son @entity22 in 2008 mr @entity22 added : ‘ for @entity22 to have died in 2008 and the @entity86 ’s processes to still be ongoing is absolutely appalling			1
how can that be protecting mothers and babies ? ‘ there has been a real failure in the way the professional regulators have worked			1
’ the independent inquiry into the trust , expected to be published next month , was finally ordered by ministers due to mounting concerns over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies			1
while officials continued to cover up the extent of the hospital ’s problems , a police investigation was eventually launched after repeated complaints from victims ’ families			2
the report is expected to lay some of the blame on the ‘ dysfunctional ’ relationship between midwives and doctors on the ward , according to the @entity121			0
the widespread ‘ loss ’ of medical records that contained vital medical information , such as in the case of @entity22 , will also be highlighted			1
an internal review published in march 2010 highlighted concerns about the maternity unit including the relations between staff			2
the @entity34 , however , failed to read the report and passed the hospital as ‘ safe ’ a year later			2
when a @entity34 official produced a dossier showing the inspection was flawed , bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission ’s reputation			0
the extent to which officals have tried to deflect attention from the failing hospital has been branded ‘ rotten ’ by ministers and likened to the @entity146 cover - up			2
the cqc and the parliamentary and health service ombudsman are also thought to be in line for criticism in dr @entity152 ’s report			0
it will raise more questions about how medical staff and those tasked with inspecting the quality of care provided are held to account			0
a string of senior staff at the trust have ‘ stepped down ’ from their jobs with lucrative pay packets - but nobody has been sacked			0
others linked to the alleged cover - up have also left their roles , with families expected to continue with legal action against the trust following the report ’s publication			0
former chief executive of the @entity175 , @entity176 , left in march with a £ 225,000 pay - off and has since moved to the private sector			0
@entity179 , former deputy chief executive of the @entity34 , was awarded £ 60,000 for distress after she was accused covering up a @entity34 report			0
she always denied the allegation			0
the @entity183 however has refused to say whether it has taken any action against any staff members or whether the nurses are still employed .			0

up to 30 babies and mothers died at @entity19
concerns first raised in 2008 when @entity22 died of infection
baby should have been treated with antibiotics at hospital in @entity20
new inquiry will conclude that neglect contributed to even more deaths
