hundreds of patients are being given potentially deadly organs from drug addicts , cancer sufferers and the elderly			1
at least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved ‘ high - risk ’ organs that could be damaged or infected			0
one surgeon was even put under pressure by officials to give livers to patients from donors dying from liver failure			1
@entity16 , who worked for @entity17 before emigrating to @entity18 , warned the @entity19 drive to increase donations was flawed			1
@entity21 , 42 , left , and @entity22 , 67 , right , both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis - causing parasitic worms earlier this month , it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm			1
the relatives of @entity21 , 42 , and grandfather @entity22 , 67 , say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at @entity35 in @entity36			0
the figures obtained from @entity38 , the authority which oversees donations , show that last year , 333 patients were given high - risk organs			1
this represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts , cancer sufferers or those aged over 71			2
mr @entity22 and mr @entity21 both underwent the operations at the @entity48 in @entity36 ( pictured ) last year and died within three weeks the 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers , the obese or the very sexually active who may have @entity54 or other infections			2
the numbers of ‘ marginal ’ organs has almost doubled in three years – there were just 181 in 2011/11			0
a planning document published by the transplant authority last year stated : ‘ as the number of marginal donors increases , surgeons are working increasingly at the extremes of what is acceptable			2
’ experts say organs are declining in quality with more now coming from the elderly or those damaged by lifestyle			0
mr @entity16 , who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist , said : ‘ we were regularly offered donors that i considered to be very high risk			1
we were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis ( blood infection )			1
‘ i was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer , which has a high risk of transmission			2
‘ we were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure			1
the vast majority of transplants that do take place in the @entity92 are successful and that ’s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community			0
‘ but this drive to increase organ donation is fundamentally flawed			1
the idea is that every patient dying in hospital should be a potential donor but there are too many ‘ ands ’ or ‘ buts ’ about a lot of patients who are dying in hospitals			2
’ although his transplant unit refused high - risk organs , they may well have been accepted by other hospitals , mr @entity16 added			1
he said hospitals were under pressure from the transplant authority to accept as many organs as possible			0
those that frequently turned them down were ‘ named and shamed ’ in monthly league tables and threatened with closure			0
the figures from the investigation – obtained by @entity124 5 ’s 5 @entity125 – relate only to donors who died and do not include living kidney donors who can survive with just one			2
one unnamed trust rejected 72 per cent of kidneys compared with another that turned down 28 per cent			0
the @entity19 is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants			1
last year – 2013/2014 – there were 4,655 transplants , an increase of 10 per cent on the year before			0
professor @entity140 , a medical director for the transplant authority , said : ‘ hundreds of people each year benefit from transplants from organs or donors that could be considered higher risk			1
‘ risks are considered against a background where many people die without a transplant and where transplant outcomes are improving			0
it ’s the responsibility of transplant surgeons and the transplant team to discuss the risks associated with a transplant with their patients and to gain consent for procedures			2
’ @entity21 and @entity22 died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic			1
disabled father of six mr @entity21 , 42 , and 67 - year - old grandfather mr @entity22 were not told about the lifestyle of their donor at a @entity19 hospital			2
they died within weeks of receiving the kidneys in november last year			0
the organs belonged to a 39 - year - old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in @entity176 and @entity177 before they were accepted by the @entity35 in @entity36			0
the man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in @entity184 , @entity17 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 from accepting his kidneys			1
it later emerged that the meningitis had been caused by the halicephalobus worm – which lives in soil and is found in horses – infecting his kidneys and brain			0
mr @entity21 ’s father @entity196 told an inquest into the two men ’s deaths at @entity200 earlier this month that the families were under the impression the donor had died in a car accident			0
both families say the men would have been happy to stay on dialysis for the rest of their lives if suitable kidneys had not been found .			0
