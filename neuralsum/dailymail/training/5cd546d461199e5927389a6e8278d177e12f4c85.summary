it was probably not the best moment for @entity2 to discuss @entity4 ’s problem attracting the female vote			1
posing on a tank after downing three pints of beer yesterday , he admitted his party ’s ‘ blokeish ’ image may put women off			2
digging himself deeper into a hole , he asked : ‘ what do you want me to do ? go sell flowers ? ’ @entity4 's @entity2 posed on a @entity18 mk 10 battle tank at the @entity19 , as he campaigned in the @entity20 by - election he hopes @entity4 candidate @entity22 can defy the odds and overturn a @entity25 majority of almost 6,000 mr @entity2 also inspected the inside of an armoured personnel carrier during his visit to the museum the @entity4 leader was campaigning in @entity20 and @entity31 ahead of tomorrow ’s by - election			1
his party ’s candidate in the @entity25 stronghold near @entity36 is attracting only half as many votes from women as from men			1
a poll showed that if only men were voting , @entity4 would win the by - election , triggered by the death of @entity25 mp @entity45			1
some 41 per cent of men said they would vote @entity4 , compared with 38 per cent for @entity25			2
in contrast , only 21 per cent of women said they would vote @entity4 , compared with 58 per cent for @entity25			0
@entity25 is predicted to retain the seat it won in 2010 with a 6,000 majority			0
but @entity4 is expected to come a close second and mr @entity2 posed on the @entity51 owned by one of his supporters to demonstrate his claim that the party has its tanks on @entity25 ’s lawn			2
@entity4 has faced claims of sexism , particularly after one of its meps said last year that a group of female activists were ‘ sluts ’			0
mr @entity2 had at first denied yesterday that his party had ‘ a women problem ’			0
but he added : ‘ i am not going to pretend to reach out to female voters or voters of all different denominations			0
during his campaigning , mr @entity2 made his now traditional visit to a local pub , @entity74 @entity4 have stepped up their attacks on @entity25 in an attempt to prove they are not just able to take votes from the @entity80 ‘ the problem with female voters and @entity4 is that , over the last five to ten years , at times , on a very bad day , we ’ve looked a bit blokeish , a bit like a rugby club on a day out and i ’m probably the most guilty person of all			0
’ he insisted there had been a ‘ sea change ’ in 2014 which had seen a boom in women candidates and senior party figures			0
@entity4 is expected to win tomorrow ’s other by - election , in @entity94 , sparked by the defection of @entity97 mp @entity96			1
embarrassingly for the @entity97 , @entity99 mayor @entity98 yesterday forgot the name of his party ’s candidate in the @entity104 seat , former bread actor @entity105			0
last night it emerged that mr @entity2 has been elected unopposed as @entity4 leader for another four years			1
but that means that if he does not win a seat in next may ’s general election and mr @entity96 holds @entity94 , it would lead to an uncomfortable situation where the party ’s leader is outside the @entity115 even though it has an mp inside .			1

@entity4 leader *climbs* on to @entity18 mk 10 battle tank to pose for *cameras*
if only men voted in @entity36 by - election , @entity4 would romp home
@entity4 is expected to win tomorrow ’s other by - election , in @entity94
insists he is not a politician but ' an *ordinary* chap who wants change '
