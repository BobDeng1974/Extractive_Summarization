it should be straightforward : @entity3 head to @entity4 in top form , @entity1 have been struggling , so @entity7 , in all likelihood , will land that elusive trophy			1
@entity10 finals never play out as smoothly as you hope			1
tensions and anxieties have a habit of affecting performances and @entity7 will be aware that the biggest threat to his ambitions comes from within			1
in many ways , @entity3 are the ones who will stop @entity3 winning			1
complacency , more than anything , is their biggest opponent now and the comfortable 3 - 0 win they recorded at @entity1 last month might actually jeopardise their chances , rather than providing a pointer to success			1
reason to be cheerful : @entity3 are big favourites to beat @entity1 at @entity4 and win the @entity10 relaxed : @entity30 were all smiles in training ahead of the final at @entity4 head up : @entity7 hopes to end @entity3 's nine - year wait for a trophy on saturday @entity36 were in a similar position in 2006			1
we went to the last @entity10 final at the @entity40 in @entity41 as long odds - on favourites to brush aside @entity44 and the vast majority who tuned in thought it would be a formality			1
nobody said anything like that in our dressing room			0
there was no sign of cockiness or arrogance but , deep down , maybe we believed that would be the case , too			0
after all , we had enjoyed a strong finish to the @entity60 campaign , including a comfortable 2 - 1 win over @entity44			1
@entity62 made a number of changes that night at @entity65 but , even though we finished with 10 men after @entity67 was sent off , we were never seriously pressed			0
with our strongest team out in @entity41 three weeks later , it should have been a breeze			0
for some reason , we never got going and paid the heaviest price for a dreadful start , trailing 2 - 0			2
maybe subconsciously we were overconfident and only an extraordinary performance from @entity75 helped save the day , as we scrambled over the line on penalties			0
so the warning signs are there			0
what also prevents you having unshakeable confidence in @entity3 is previous games of this nature : the ghosts of the 2011 @entity87 final against @entity88 still haunt @entity7 , while they struggled to get past @entity89 in this year ’s semi-final			1
they needed penalties to win then , having looked at one point as if they would crash out			0
it should also be remembered @entity3 have yet to win a game outright at the new @entity4 , having lost a 2009 @entity10 semi-final to @entity98			1
if this were a @entity60 game , you would n’t foresee anything other than an @entity3 win as @entity7 ’s side have been ruthlessly efficient in dispatching inferior opponents , but the stage , the stakes and the pressure mean there have to be doubts on saturday afternoon			1
nightmare : the last time @entity3 reached a @entity4 final , they lost 2 - 1 to @entity88 in the @entity87 underdogs : @entity88 lifted the @entity87 to extend @entity3 's trophy-less stretch rounded : @entity116 scores for @entity98 against @entity3 in the 2009 @entity10 semi-final at @entity4 for @entity1 to win , they need to make it a physical game , as @entity3 still fail to deal with such demands			1
they will miss their cup - tied strikers , @entity122 and @entity123 , but perhaps it will give @entity125 the chance to spring a surprise with his tactics			1
he has used a three - man defence at times this season but will he change to accommodate whoever plays up front ? @entity125 will have @entity133 and @entity134 , two former @entity136 men , sitting in the engine room , trying to orchestrate a win			2
if they can launch counter-attacks , @entity3 might find themselves in difficulty			2
if @entity1 were to open the scoring , it would really test the character of @entity7 ’s men			1
@entity3 are guaranteed to have plenty of possession , but if @entity1 get everyone behind the ball , it wo n’t be easy for the favourites to find a way through — @entity4 is a slow pitch and requires patience , which is why the first goal will be crucial			1
any doubts @entity3 have about themselves will surface if they go behind			2
back to fitness : @entity157 was on the scoresheet as @entity3 cruised past @entity1 in their @entity60 clash making plans ? a sign in @entity162 of road closures the day after the @entity10 final in charge : @entity1 manager @entity125 has led his team to @entity60 safety and the cup final however , with @entity157 back and in great form — where would the title have gone had he stayed fit ? — @entity3 should win and it would be nice to see @entity7 lift a trophy once more after all he has done for our game			1
i have the utmost respect and admiration for him and his reign needs another moment to savour before he moves on			0
equally , there are few @entity184 managers in the game with trophies on their cv			0
looking at the final @entity60 table , it was alarming to realise that of the 20 managers who finished the season , only five were @entity184 and none has lifted a major honour			2
delight : @entity36 were given a huge scare before beating @entity44 on penalties in the 2006 @entity10 final @entity199 and great : @entity75 's injury - time strike rescued @entity36 as they won on penalties pushed aside : @entity1 will be without cup - tied striker @entity122 at @entity4 end of season : striker @entity123 will also miss the showpiece in north @entity204 @entity125 , who has done an excellent job this season , now has a glorious opportunity to put that @entity208 the influx of foreign owners and coaches , it would be fitting to see him hoist the trophy and join a select group who have won the @entity10 as a player and manager			1
there is no doubt @entity125 has been deeply disappointed with the way @entity1 ’s form has tailed off			2
@entity4 has clearly been a distraction			2
should @entity3 take their eye off the ball , though , they will be wound up to take advantage — and make sure it is anything but straightforward			2
engine : @entity134 ( left ) and @entity133 ( right ) will be at the heart of @entity1 's midfield on board : @entity230 leads the @entity1 players onto their flight at @entity233 farewell to the peerless @entity234 the curtain comes down this weekend on the career of @entity234 , one of the all - time great defenders			1
@entity234 ’s retirement will be a blow to everyone at @entity241			0
the club are losing an icon , his team - mates are losing a leader and the supporters are losing a player who represented their values			2
@entity249 is the term you associate with @entity241 but you would n’t necessarily use that to describe @entity234 , who is tough , uncompromising with an indomitable spirit			0
those qualities , however , are what i believe made him special			0
playing as a central defender for @entity241 can not be easy			0
yes , they are a great team , but the way they attack leaves defenders exposed and it speaks volumes for his ability that he was as important to @entity267 ’s all - conquering team as @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270			0
he was the man of steel who led them into battle			0
goodbye : @entity241 will bid farewell to @entity234 at the end of this season glittering : @entity234 won six @entity278 titles and three champions @entity279 with the @entity281 having won almost every major honour in football — the @entity284 is all that is missing from what would be the perfect set — @entity234 bows out with one of finest cvs you could wish to see and he is the perfect example to every player of what you can achieve if you have desire , persistence and are prepared to work			0
he always had a ferocious will to win and determination — and do n’t underestimate the influence he had on the magicians around him			0
as someone who played in my position , @entity234 will forever have my respect .			0
