the announcement effectively ends ms @entity6 ’s tenure as @entity4 ’s first lady			2
her split from mr @entity3 also means she loses her office with five staff , and numerous other perks including chauffeur - driven limousines and homes across @entity4			2
yesterday ’s statement came as 48 - year - old ms @entity6 set off on a ‘ humanitarian ’ visit to @entity40 , where she is expected to speak for the first time since the scandal broke			1
last night she tweeted her first reaction , writing : ‘ all my gratitude goes to the extraordinary staff at the @entity46			1

‘ this is the kind of problem which has held up a formal announcement of a separation , ’ said one			0
as the farce descended to new depths , senior journalists were briefed yesterday morning that mr @entity3 would announce his separation from ms @entity6 ‘ imminently ’			1
leading newspaper websites and satellite tv channels ran the news as their main item until about 2.30pm			0
it was then that an @entity46 spokesman backtracked and said : ‘ there will be no announcement today			2
there are false rumours circulating in the @entity4 media			0
’ @entity4 president @entity3 , pictured left meeting @entity75 at the @entity77 yesterday , has split from his partner @entity6			1

ms @entity6 is increasingly being viewed as a ‘ loose cannon ’ who may attempt to humiliate mr @entity3 for dumping her just one - and - a - half years into his term of office			1
mr @entity3 , who has never married , is now set to concentrate on his relationship with ms @entity14			1
on january 10 , photographs appeared in @entity82 showing @entity3 sneaking in and out of their @entity91 love nest , trying to disguise his identity with a crash helmet			0
the notoriously volatile ms @entity6 , who is twice divorced , first flew into a rage and then checked herself into a @entity91 hospital for eight days , suffering from emotional shock			2
she is said to have thrown valuable @entity46 property at mr @entity3 , although claims that she caused £ 2.5 million worth of damage to antiques , including a vase dating back to the reign of @entity105 , have been denied			1
the announcement came as a new opinion poll confirmed that ms @entity6 was by far the most unpopular first lady in the recent history of @entity4			2

situated in @entity132 , west of @entity91 , it comes complete with a heated swimming pool and one of the best stocked wine cellars in the country			0
this caused huge embarrassment to mr @entity3 , a socialist who claims to ‘ dislike the rich ’ but who has been blamed for his country ’s spiralling unemployment rate and cost of living			0
up until today , ms @entity6 had been desperate to salvage her relationship with mr @entity3 , telling friends she ‘ forgave him ’ and wanted to get back to work			1
she was particularly keen to accompany mr @entity3 on a trip to @entity150 in february , when the couple were due to stay with the @entity152 at the @entity153			0
meanwhile , the delighted ms @entity14 is already said to have held a party for close friends and family to celebrate her relationship with mr @entity3 being made public			2
a photograph of the smiling actress , who has appeared in more than 50 @entity4 films , is splashed across the cover of the latest edition of @entity113			0
