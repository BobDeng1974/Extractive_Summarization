under - fire : the state - backed bank conceded it had ¿ over corrected ¿ its policy on lending to small business on the same day , it also emerged that the bank ’s lending to small businesses has collapsed by £ 17billion since it was rescued by the taxpayer in 2008			1
at its peak , @entity1 lent £ 55billion to small firms			1
now , it is £ 38billion , according to a report by sir @entity40 , former @entity39 deputy governor			1
business secretary @entity41 said he was ‘ appalled ’ by mr @entity25 ’s study while chancellor @entity42 described the claims as ‘ shocking ’			1
sir @entity40 ’s report also revealed a string of embarrassing facts about the bank , including : * six in ten loan applications to @entity1 are ‘ screened out ’ even before customers formally request a loan , more than in the rest of the industry ; * of those who submit an application , just a third are successful ; * the majority of @entity1 managers admit they only submit an application if they are ‘ 100 per cent sure ’ it will be approved by bosses			1
they are not incentivised to lend to small firms			2
probe : businessman @entity25 compiled a damning report on the bank 's activities the bank ’s recently appointed boss , @entity65 , said it had ‘ over corrected ’ since its days of reckless lending			0
in a letter to sir @entity40 , he said : ‘ in many cases , the pendulum of risk aversion has swung too hard to one side			0
’ meanwhile , mr @entity25 concluded : ‘ the findings of the report do clearly show heavy - handed , profiteering and abhorrent behaviour of some of the banks			0
‘ the evidence received does			0
indicate a far darker situation than just the existence of conditions which could lead to the mistreatment of businesses			2
‘ it is undeniable that some of the banks , @entity1 in particular , are harming their customers			1
’ the two reports come three years after the @entity88 launched its make @entity91 campaign in july 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms			0
at the time , lord king , then @entity39 governor , discussed the ‘ heartbreaking ’ way in which banks treated small firms			0
yesterday liberal democrat @entity97 said the report was ‘ a damning indictment of @entity1 ’s failure to lend ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity102 ’s small businesses do n’t need another inquiry			2
they need our @entity105 - backed bank and the funding for lending scheme to focus on real growth and jobs , not forcing up house prices to ever less affordable peaks			0
’ @entity113 , of the @entity114 , said banks ’ ethics ‘ continue to astound ’			0
he said mr @entity25 ’s claims of ‘ artificially distressing businesses to gain more fees and assets before making them insolvent would be contemptible , if proven true ’			2
@entity122 , of business network the @entity124 , said : ‘ economic recovery will be secured by small and medium sized firms who have the confidence to take on new staff , expand their business and invest in the future			2
‘ we are deeply concerned by reports @entity1 , a state - owned bank , is behaving in a way that appears to put their short - term objectives over the interests of @entity102 ’s small businesses			1
’ small and medium - sized firms employ 60 per cent of @entity102 ’s private sector workforce			0
sir @entity40 ’s review looked at relationship managers and credit officers at the bank – the people responsible for lending decisions			0
business secretary @entity41 said he was ‘ appalled ’ by mr @entity25 ’s study while chancellor @entity42 described the claims as ‘ shocking ’ he found that after the crisis , bonuses became less directly linked to the number of loans agreed , while there were sanctions imposed for approving applications that went on to be rejected			1
the changes made staff less likely to give businesses a chance , even when it was a fair risk , he said.the review adds that a complex and flawed credit process is also to blame for the low number of loans taken up by @entity166			1
many who were approved refused the loans because they were not offered the terms they wanted			2
sir @entity40 said three sources had spoken about ‘ extreme allegations ’ of mistreatment			2
mr @entity65 pledged to improve @entity166 lending by writing to thousands of firms about loans , starting a website on the lending process , promising to make most decisions in five days , training staff and improving the appeals process			2
by @entity181 @entity182 with daughters @entity187 ( right ) , @entity184 ( top left ) and @entity185 ( bottom left ) @entity182 says his life was ‘ utterly devastated ’ when @entity1 pulled funding from his hotel business 11 days before it was due to open			1
the father of three said the stress of his firm ’s collapse took its toll on his wife @entity195 , who died from lung cancer in may			0
‘ her last words to me were “ promise me you will never give up this fight ”			0
so that ’s why i ’m taking legal action now - they just ca n’t get away with this			0
’ ‘ the stress of our finances certainly contributed to her death and i do n’t know how i ’ll ever recover from that			0
’ mr @entity182 , 48 , began refurbishing the @entity211 hotel in @entity212 , @entity213 , in 2008 with a £ 5.4million loan from @entity215 , which is owned by @entity1			1
with just £ 120,000 of work left to do on its car park , he had hired staff and fully stocked his 79 - bedroom luxury hotel			2
but within the space of a week , he said his business , which had been valued at £ 7.7million in 2010 , had been snuffed out when @entity215 said they would no longer support him			1
‘ despite the fact we had only drawn £ 4.2million of our loan , we were told we had run out of money and they would n’t back us any more			2
all of a sudden , we were forced to go into administration because they got someone else in to value the business at £ 2.5million - a third of what @entity232 [ the property firm ] said it was worth just four months before			1
’ mr @entity182 is now working part - time as a labourer to support daughters @entity185 , 13 , @entity184 , 16 , and 19 - year - old @entity187			0
