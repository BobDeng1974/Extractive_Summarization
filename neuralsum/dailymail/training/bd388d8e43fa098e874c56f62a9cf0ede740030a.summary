by @entity0 published : 02:21 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 03:07 est , 12 june 2012 police are 37 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person , latest research has shown			2
human rights group , @entity5 ( @entity6 ) , investigated what are known as section 60 stops , where officers detain people without suspecting them of being involved in any particular crime			1
the researchers discovered that while overall use of the power had fallen , excessive use against ethnic minorities had continued or in some instances increased			0
racial profiling : black people are 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people ( file picture ) three quarters of all section 60 stops were carried out by the metropolitan police , a total of 258,000 between 2008 and 2011			1
the next highest was @entity27 where officers conducted 40,940 section 60s in the same time period			0
some forces barely used the power at all			0
( file picture ) between 2008 and 2009 @entity35 officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area according to the @entity6 , between 2008 and 2009 , @entity35 officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area			1
although this fell by more than half between 2010 and 2011 to 32.8 per 1,000 , in the rest of @entity43 the figure was just 1.2 per 1,000			0
however the highest rates of racial disproportionality were outside @entity46 with an officer in the @entity48 28 times more likely to search a black person than a white person			2
overall black people were found to be 37 times more likely to be stopped under @entity52 that white people			1
@entity55 people were 10 times more likely to be stopped			2
the effectiveness of the searches has also been called in to question as it was revealed that between 2008 and 2009 only 2.8 per cent of @entity52 searches resulted in an arrest falling to just 2.4 per cent between 2010 and 2011			1
in most cases police officers are required to have what is referred to as ' reasonable suspicion ' that someone is involved in a crime before conducting a search			0
however the @entity52 power , which is part of the 1994 @entity69 introduced as a response to the rise in illegal raves , gives an officer the power to stop and search a person simply because they might fear violence or disorder			0
response : a spokesman for the @entity35 defended its use of section 60 searches saying : ' these powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife , gun and gang crimes ' a spokesman for @entity6 told the @entity91 newspaper : ' black youths are still being disproportionally targetted and without a clear explanation as to why , many in the community will see this as racial profiling			1
' moreover , police data itself questions the effectiveness of this practise			0
some forces are using 200 or 300 stops before arresting an individual over a weapon			0
' a spokesman for the @entity35 defended its use of @entity52 searches saying : ' these powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife , gun and gang crimes			1

between 2008 and 2009 @entity35 officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area
human rights group question legality of ' racial profiling '
@entity35 spokesman claims ' powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife , gun and gang crimes '
