politicians ' living quarters are under close inspection in order to establish just how human and how like us they really are			1
it is the current prime minister 's kitchen that has got everyone talking more than any of the other political leaders ' – perhaps because he is a known ' toff ' , and @entity11 , despite protests from the left and now the right , really still are obsessed with class			1
score one point for each - the more points you get , the more upmarket your house must be			1
the kitchen a @entity39 those pesky middle - middle classes have fallen hook , line and capsule for these sleekly designed , all style and no substance coffee machines , but those of true upmarket stock know that you ca n't beat freshly ground coffee in a cafetiere			1
you will probably own a few of these , in different sizes , to cater for varying numbers of drinkers			1
a cookery book shelf of little - known authors if your kitchen shelves are teaming with works by @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 then you 're in trouble			1
those of better stock will stick to tired , faded old works – think @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 ( the latter only if you have @entity70 blood the family )			1
@entity28 says that there are several items that you are required to own for your home to be ' posh ' @entity77 's books are all right so long as they are the @entity78 ones and you are able to talk at length about her terribly helpful cooking instructions for @entity82 alongside each recipe			1
an aga a little hackneyed now but still a good sign that you 're in a house of good standing			1
the older and rustier the @entity89 the better and preferably oil or gas			2
a bonus point for each dog found lolling in front of this classy cooker			2
a cling @entity98 too many kitchen gadgets and you 're on thin ice but one of these terribly clever dispensers for cling - film is a ' godsend ! ' ( shout this ) and saves so much time as you 're covering the leftovers of the pickled pears			1
very few people know about them or have them and they always impress when friends use it			2
@entity114 very few people will see these – but that does n't matter as you 're upper - middle class or above and so do n't care whether people see it or not – but a good , solid bin bag is heavenly and you ca n't imagine going back to the cheap ones now			2
deduct a point if you call them some lower - middle euphemistic name like ' refuse sack '			2
proper tea and coffee cups no politician has been seen with anything but a mug when snapped in their own home since 1997 , but tea or coffee from the proper vessel ( i.e. one that requires a saucer ) is a must for better houses			1
an extra point if you know the difference between a coffee cup and a demitasse cup			2
cloth napkins for kitchen @entity147 most people will know to get out the nice napkins ( never ' serviettes ' ) for guests but those of better breeding will ensure cloth napkins are set for even the most simple of suppers for one			1
knock off a mark if you have ever given a guest a piece of kitchen roll in lieu of a proper napkin			1
old fashioned it may be but @entity28 says that an @entity89 is still a good status symbol @entity28 says that a posh household should opt for a cup and saucer ( right ) over a mug ( left ) for a hot drink bathroom a @entity170 there 's no better smell than fresh air , but for city - dwelling upmarket folk this may not be to hand ( or a bathroom may have no windows )			1
a reed diffuser is now just about passable as bathroom décor , but from certain brands only , naturally ( @entity181 : yes , @entity182 : no )			2
a citrus smell , always , for the upstairs bathroom			2
never , under pain of death , an @entity185			2
when it comes to seating @entity28 says that fabric sofas are the only way to go @entity28 says that a leather sofa is seen as ' a tad suspect ' among the middle classes @entity195 the upper classes would sooner use sandpaper than quilted lavatory roll			1
your loo paper must be plain white and un-textured			0
three - ply , mind			0
@entity204 bathrooms in smart old houses will have two taps rather than a ' mono ' alternative			0
these new funky taps are fine for a pied - à - terre but if your house is older than 1980 then two taps it must be			0
there are even rules when it comes to toilet roll , according to @entity28 it should always be white and under no circumstances whatsoever should it be quilted sitting room ( never ' @entity227 ' ) books to @entity229 you may award yourself a point if the number of books you own and that are on display outweighs the number of dvds			1
buy 1p copies of the classics online if your shelves are bulging with far too many films ( which normally means to have far too much free time , too )			0
a fabric sofa leather sofas are always seen as a tad suspect amongst the upper - middles and uppers			0
@entity248 is the only way to go , frankly			0
@entity250 there should be lots of these , ideally ones that have been handed down or given to you or family members for landmark birthdays and anniversaries			0
an extra point if the picture of you meeting @entity261 is in one of the smaller ones an tucked away somewhere so discreet you may as well not have it on display			0
television the rules have shifted for ' the telly ' ( fine to call it that in an ironic way )			0
naff tv cabinets to hide the thing are definitely lower - middle and now no - one makes them to fit modern flat screens anyway			1
loud and proud , that 's what we now want			0
yes that 's a big old tv and you 're not afraid to show it … although anything over 42 inches is ostentatious			0
just up your prescription if you ca n't see the screen			0
deduct a mark , if not four , if you have a cinema room			1
@entity288 ? 18 - 14 : upper class in the words of @entity291 , you ’re the top ! give your self a good hearty pat on the back and relax with satisfaction ( although do n’t undo your hard work and go about boasting about this ! ) 13 – 9 : upper middle close , but not quite			0
you can still hold your head up high when inviting pretty much most of the population into your house , but best offer to meet your upper friends in a restaurant or café somewhere until you sort a few things out			0
8 – 5 : middle - middle nothing to feel ashamed about , although of course you will inside feel deeply anguished at your insecurity within the class food chain			0
go and have a soothing cup of tea ( from a mug ) to calm yourself down			0
4 – 1 : lower - middle let ’s say no more about this			0
