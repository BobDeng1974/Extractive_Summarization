by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 13:24 est , 13 march 2013 this is the toe - curling moment a wealthy motorist surveyed the scene after his £ 180,000 sports car was struck by a runaway old banger			0
the @entity6 was parked at a petrol station yesterday afternoon when the tiny pink @entity8 lost control going round a roundabout and careered onto the garage forecourt			1
it smashed into the 190mph @entity6 - a favourite of @entity14 - as its owner stood filling it up , shunting it into a petrol pump			1
onlookers watched in horror as the little pink runabout crashed into the £ 100,000 @entity6 yesterday after the accident at @entity25 's @entity24 garage , the @entity6 's owner , who asked not to be named , said the car was damaged beyond repair			1
he said : ' i was filling up and then i saw the car coming towards me			0
' she drove out of the petrol station onto the roundabout , lost it and came over the kerb and straight into my car			1
my car moved into the pump and bumped the pump off			0
' he told the @entity42 : ' my car will be a write - off			0
they wo n't fix that			0
' a passer - by , who saw the incident , said : ' she lost control on the roundabout and span around and into the petrol station			1
' it all happened so fast in front of me			0
' paramedics and police attended but neither driver was hurt in the incident which happened just before 3pm			0
the petrol station was closed while staff worked to repair the damaged pump			2
hitting the road sign might have been cheaper : the @entity62 hit the well - polished @entity6 squarely on its side shaken not stirred : neither the owner of the @entity6 nor the @entity8 was injured in yesterday 's accident a spokesman for @entity67 said : ' we were called at 2.55pm to reports of two cars colliding on the forecourt of the @entity24 petrol station			1
' one of the cars had gone into a pump			0
there was no fire but there was a strong smell of fumes			0
' @entity6 sportscars have been featured in several @entity14 films , with the @entity6 appearing as 007 's car in both @entity84 and @entity85			1
a spokesman for @entity6 said : ' the dbs is not of the understated elegance of a @entity88 , nor the youthful agility of the @entity90			2
' it is explosive power in a black tie , and has its own unique character which will equal that of @entity14			2
' when the @entity6 went on sale in 2007 , prices started from £ 180,000 , but the model was discontinued last year			2
powered by a 6 - litre v12 engine , the 510bhp @entity6 is capable of 0 - 62mph in just 4.3 seconds , and boasts a top speed of 190mph			1
in real life , @entity14 actor @entity100 , who drove the @entity6 in @entity84 , is a fan , too			1
earlier this month the star , who turned 45 on march 2 , was pictured taking delivery of a bright red £ 150,000 @entity104 , leaving neighbours wondering if the convertible @entity6 was a present to himself			2
@entity109 star @entity108 described the @entity6 as a model which is ' as close to perfect as a car can be ' .			0

the sportscar , a favourite of @entity14 , was filling up at @entity25 garage
