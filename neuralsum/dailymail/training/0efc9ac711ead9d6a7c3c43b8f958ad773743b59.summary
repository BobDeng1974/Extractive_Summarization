by @entity0 bending down for those household chores was causing her elderly mother some pain			0
but rather than employing a carer , @entity4 found another way to help 94 - year - old @entity7 - of the four - legged variety , that is			1
and mrs @entity4 , 66 , has trained her dog @entity10 to lend a hand - or , rather , paw - whenever her aging mother comes to stay at her house			1
@entity4 and her @entity14 , @entity10 who are both appearing in @entity15 on @entity16 it means mrs @entity7 , whose 95th birthday is not far off , need n't stoop to pull a load out of the washing machine			1
nor should she fret if she forgets where she left her keys is - a simple call to @entity10 will see the missing item come running			1
and in those moments when the television remote control is just out of reach , the gentle - natured dog is there to help and stop her stretching to the point of pain			0
of course , it was never planned this way			0
and mrs @entity4 and her husband @entity34 first got the four - year - old labradoodle as company for their lonely @entity37 after another dog died			1
but when the inquisitive pup kept on sticking his head in the washing machine , and slobbering over household appliances , it dawned on mrs @entity4 that she could put him to good use			1
@entity10 the labradoodle has been trained to take washing out of the machine for his owners ' my mum is elderly and i thought actually he could , say she was staying here and i 'd gone to work he could do things for her , ' the retired probation service worker explained			1
' she 's almost 95 so some things are a bit difficult so i thought it would be a real help if he could do things like empty the washing machine			0
' so she set to work , and with some gentle coaxing - in the form of chicken - flavoured nugget treats – she taught him to pull socks and pants from the bowl and drop them into a laundry basket			0
inspired , no doubt , and sensing an opportunity for more , mrs @entity4 tried it out with some keys , this time coating them in cat mint - a special scent that is familiar to hounds			1
low and behold , @entity10 was soon able to delve into her handbag and find them , at the simple command of ' keys '			1
@entity10 means that @entity4 has n't had to get a carer for her mother @entity81 and his skills transferred to remote controls , newspapers and slippers , which @entity10 will place - slightly slobbered - into an outstretched hand			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' she could say " i 've dropped my paper , @entity10 , bring it " , and he 'd bring it to her			1
or if she needed the remote passing or could n't find her slippers or keys , she could ask @entity10 for them			2
' of course , whetting @entity10 ' appetite for household objects has had its ups and downs			2
and curiosity got the better of him one day last year when he happened upon a mobile phone in mrs @entity4 's bag , while she was getting ready to visit her daughter			2
' he went into the handbag , took my mobile out , and when i came back in it was open , the whole thing , ' she said			0
' so i snapped it shut , put it in my bag and drove off			0
' @entity110 is presenting @entity15 on @entity16 at the time she did n't think anything of it , and it was n't until the phone failed to function the following day that mrs @entity4 discovered the battery was missing			1
when she returned home to search for the lost piece , however , it appeared to have vanished			2
but a trip to the vets soon solved the mystery - fergus had swallowed the battery			0
' thankfully , before i 'd even realised that he 'd swallowed it , it had passed through him , ' mrs @entity4 said			2
' otherwise it would have been an extremely big operation			0
' since then , however , @entity10 has learned his lesson			2
and his seemingly endless appetite – which has seen him reach 35kg - is now reserved for the treats he gets for the successful completion of a trick			0
and in recent weeks he has scoffed even more than usual , learning new skills as part of @entity15 - a tv show seeking to find the country 's most able hound			0
the show , which started last week on @entity16 , is sponsored by @entity141 and hosted by former @entity142 actor @entity110			2
the series will see dog pairs compete in events such as swimming , jumping and agility			0
the successful dogs will go through to the semi-final and final next week to compete for £ 1,000 in reward money .			0
