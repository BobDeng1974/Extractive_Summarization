by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:46 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:58 est , 24 december 2013 an independent report which found there was evidence that @entity7 mp @entity6 ' made unwelcome sexual advances ' towards a vulnerable female constituent , has been branded ' one - sided ' by the former @entity10 the report , seen by the @entity12 , found there was ' prima facie evidence ' the backbencher , who resigned from the party over the allegations , had made the ' sexual approaches '			1
the mp was arrested in 2010 in connection with the allegations but @entity22 police decided there was not enough evidence to mount a criminal case			1
@entity27 mp @entity6 has today claimed an independent report which claims there is evidence he sexually assaulted a ' vulnerable ' constituent is one - sided as his accuser sues him in the @entity33 he was accused of making repeated sexual advances towards the woman , who had contacted him for help in dealing with her ' noisy neighbours '			1
it is alleged that mr @entity6 sexually assaulted the woman despite knowing she suffered mental health problems and had been sexually abused as a child			1
his accuser is taking civil action , suing mr @entity6 through the @entity33			1
but the mp has vowed to clear his name , vehemently denying the allegations			0
@entity47 instructed @entity48 , a leading barrister specialising in sexual crime cases , to interview the alleged victim after the council said it received a standards complaint against the @entity54 councillor			1
in june mr @entity6 , 67 , stood down from the @entity10 after a meeting with the party ’s chief whip , @entity56			2
in an exchange of letters , the mp wrote : ‘ i have decided to temporarily withdraw from the parliamentary party in the @entity61 until the civil court case against me has been concluded			2
he added that he would ‘ vigorously defend my position and that i completely refute the allegations made against me ’			0
but in august , mr @entity67 's report , seen by @entity68 and @entity69 at the @entity12 , concluded there is evidence of sexual approaches made by the mp			1
the inquiry goes on to conclude that mr @entity6 was aware of the woman 's mental health problems			1
the @entity12 reported mr @entity67 said in the 49 - page report : ' i consider that the prima facie evidence of his unwelcome sexual approaches remains unquestionably a very serious matter in the light of the position which he holds and his knowledge from the beginning of the vulnerability of ( the alleged victim )			1
' the mp stepped down from the @entity10 party in june vowing to clear his name in the @entity33 the report is based on mr @entity67 's investigation of a seven - month period from november 2009 , the @entity12 said			1
the leading barrister also looked into text messages sent by mr @entity6 to the alleged victim			1
in the messages , the mp refers to his accuser as ' my princess ' , and tells her she is ' special and sexy ' to him			0
the woman , who was 35 at the time , claimed mr @entity6 touched her breast , exposed himself to her and kissed her without consent			1
it is also alleged the mp took the woman 's son , aged 12 at the time , to parliament for dinner , bought her a teddy bear named @entity6 and sent her numerous text messages			2
the report was compiled following two interviews with the alleged victim , and mr @entity67 's examination of her mental health history , @entity12 said			1
it says the woman is ' convincing and truthful ' but also ' angry and hurt ' by what she claimed had happened			0
' making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of [ the alleged victim ] , i have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by mr @entity6			1
' i am of the clear view that her account is credible and merits both compassion and respect , ' he wrote in the report			0
' i found [ the alleged victim ] to be a straightforward and vulnerable person , angry and hurt by what she said had happened to her … indeed , at no point did i form the view that she lied to me , ' he said			2
mr @entity67 added mr @entity6 had shown kindness towards the woman , which had not been reflected in the media			1
he said : ' there is clear evidence that he sought to help her wholly properly as her local councillor in a detailed way which was commendable			0
mr @entity67 says he did approach mr @entity6 but sources close to the council told @entity12 the mp declined to meet the barrister			1
a spokesman for mr @entity6 today accused the report of being ' one - sided ' adding the mp looks forward to the case coming before the @entity33 so he can ' strongly and utterly refute ' the accusations made			1
the spokesman said : ' these matters have twice been looked at by the police , first in 2010 , and in conjunction with the @entity158 , they have found that there is no case for mr @entity6 to answer and have taken no further action			1
when a person complains to police they are the victim of a sexual offence , they are immediately granted anonymity for life			0
the @entity169 , 2003 , includes numerous crimes including : those convicted of a sexual offence will be forced to sign the @entity173 for a length of time dictated by the sentencing judge			0
once a police force has gathered the evidence , they present their findings to the @entity158			0
it is the @entity158 who review the evidence and determine whether there is enough evidence to bring a case to court			0
where they decide the evidence is insufficient , the case is dropped			0
but the alleged victim is entitled to take civil action , suing the alleged perpetrator for damages			1
in criminal proceedings the prosecution has to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty			0
but in civil court the @entity199 standard is only to prove guilt on the basis of a balance of probability			0
' @entity6 looks forward to the civil case coming to court so that he can bring forward evidence to strongly and utterly refute the allegations made			1
' the independent legal advice to @entity47 noted that the @entity33 was a better place to establish matters of fact - not least because it could take evidence under oath which the council can not			2
' @entity6 asked to meet with the council 's independent investigator to explain this and this was denied him despite the city council 's solicitor asking the investigator to meet mr @entity6			2
' he therefore believes the report which he has not seen is likely to be one - sided			2
' the most suitable place to settle a civil case is in court and not in the newspapers			0
' as this is an on - going legal case , it not appropriate for @entity6 to give a running commentary			2
' in the meantime he will continue to work hard to serve his constituents as an mp and councillor			0
' following the completion of the report in august , police officers re-examined the claims made but announced in november that they required more evidence and dropped the case			2
a spokesman for @entity47 , told @entity241 their inquiry into the allegations have been suspended until the conclusion of the civil case			2
the council 's solicitor , @entity246 , said : ' the council 's procedure for dealing with complaints against councillors makes no provision for a copy of a report to be provided to a complainant or to be published			0
' we have therefore been unable to release it			0
we anticipate that we will be reviewing our procedure once the investigation of this complaint is over			0
' after legal advice , the council sub-committee running the investigation decided on november 15 that it could be unsafe to deal with the complaint using our internal disciplinary process when the same allegations were due to be tested in the @entity33			2
' it therefore postponed the process until the @entity33 action was concluded			0
' it felt there was a risk of inconsistency between a decision the council could reach and one which the @entity33 might reach			0
' in deciding to postpone , it also considered the greater suitability of the @entity33 for determining contested issues of fact , including its ability to compel the attendance of witnesses , and provision for cross-examination while on oath			0
