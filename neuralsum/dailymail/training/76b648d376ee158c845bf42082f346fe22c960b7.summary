a grovelling @entity0 hugged and kissed @entity2 president @entity1 in a show of contrition after nobody important from the @entity6 joined a solidarity march in the wake of the terror attack on @entity10			1
the secretary of state even brought back - up for his visit in the form of singer @entity15 , who patched up the @entity17 's oldest diplomatic relationship with a rendition of ' @entity19 '			1
arriving at the presidential @entity20 , @entity0 reached out his hands for @entity1 , embraced him closely , then appeared to kiss him on the cheek in an awkward display for the cameras			2
he later gave a message from the @entity17 people , delivered in almost - fluent @entity2			1
left , @entity0 watches the performance with @entity10 mayor @entity49 @entity1 and @entity0 made sure to present a very public display of togetherness during the visit , with this awkward hug outside of the @entity20 '' you 've been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on september 11 @entity0 told @entity1 : ' i wanted to tell you personally of the horror and revulsion that all @entity17 felt at these cowardly and despicable attacks against innocent victims and fundamental values			1
' but despite his best efforts , he stumbled when pronouncing ' dégoût ' - the @entity2 word for revulsion			2
@entity0 was not available to personally join @entity1 and leaders from dozens of other @entity69 nations last week when they marched in solidarity with the victims of an armed terrorist massacre			2
the @entity6 later admitted it was a mistake not to send a high - profile representative , and said @entity76 would have liked to go to honor the deaths of staff at the satirical magazine @entity41			2
@entity81 officials denied that @entity0 had apologized for @entity17 absence at the march - or that the current event was his way of saying sorry			2
but @entity2 officials said he had already apologized in private			0
singer - songwriter @entity15 was @entity0 's weapon of choice for the public make - up with the @entity2 , often lauded as the @entity17 's ' oldest ally '			1
at an acoustic performance in @entity10 's city hall , @entity15 strummed @entity2 national anthem @entity45 , then serenaded @entity0 , @entity1 and the mayor of @entity10 with his 1971 hit ' you 've got a friend			1
' hero : also present at the @entity20 was @entity99 ( pictured ) , the man who saved several @entity101 shoppers during a hostage situation in @entity10 last week honoured : the @entity104 immigrant , pictured here greeting @entity17 secretary of state @entity0 , is being granted @entity2 citizenship in light of his heroics @entity17 's absence has received widespread criticism , although @entity0 has contended @entity17 officials had been ' deeply engaged ' with @entity2 authorities since the @entity41 terrorist attack			1
he said attacking the @entity76 administration was ' sort of quibbling a little bit ' - despite the @entity6 's backpedaling			0
' our assistant secretary of state @entity120 was there and marched , our ambassador was there and marched , many people from the embassy were there and marched , ' @entity0 stated			0
@entity0 - who could n't attend because of existing commitments - told a news conference on thursday : ' i do n't feel any other exigencies , other than continuation of our friendship and our responsibilities as good friends and the longest ally in our history , and that 's why i am going			0
' but @entity2 foreign minister @entity137 - who accompanied @entity0 to view wreaths laid outside the @entity101 supermarket targeted in last week 's terror attacks - said today @entity0 had ' apologised '			1
while the two were getting close outside the @entity20 , one of @entity10 's main stations had to be evacuated after a bomb scare the @entity17 secretary of state certainly made good on his promise to give a ' big hug ' to @entity10 during the visit @entity0 was joined by @entity2 foreign minister @entity137 on a trip to see the wreaths outside the @entity41 offices twelve were killed in last wednesday 's brutal attack by brothers @entity154 and @entity156 - who were angry at the satirical magazine 's cartoons of the @entity159 sunday 's march , attended by leaders from across the world , was a show of unity with the magazine and a rally for free speech @entity0 also met with @entity1 , who thanked @entity0 for his country 's support as the two undertook a very public show of togetherness outside the @entity20			1
' you 've been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on september 11			0
you know what it means for a country			0
... we must find together appropriate responses , ' @entity1 said			0
meanwhile , just less than three miles away from the @entity10 , police had shut and evacuated @entity184 train station after a bomb threat			0
the station , one of several main terminals in the @entity2 capital , serves cities in eastern @entity10 and countries to the east			2
@entity0 also visited the @entity197 offices in @entity10 , the funeral of its late editor , @entity194 , was taking place some 17 miles away			0
the funeral of @entity41 editor @entity199 also took place this morning @entity2 cartoonist @entity202 , aka @entity203 , juggles with a clementine as he arrives for the funeral in @entity206 , outside @entity10 his funeral is one of several taking place today , while more took place yesterday - including the funeral of cartoonist @entity212 , 57 crowds gathered in @entity206 , north of the @entity2 capital , where the cartoonist known as ' @entity215 ' was honoured with speeches and music , including some provided by @entity219 bagpipes			1
two large screens were placed outside @entity221 in @entity215 's home town , so people could watch what was happening			0
the cartoonist @entity225 , 74 , and @entity226 , a 60 year - old @entity41 copy taker , were also set to be buried today .			0

contrite @entity229 arrived in @entity10 for belated show of unity
followed @entity6 choice not to send anyone important to @entity10 march
