by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 15:23 est , 4 december 2012 the forensic expert who has scientifically forecasted how the @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity5 's little boy or girl could look said it is sure to be ' adorable '			1
@entity9 based @entity8 has taken all the best features of the royal couple and morphed them together			1
and with their piercing blue eyes , clear complexion and @entity3 's thick dark locks , the child could be a royal beauty			1
but , boy or girl , it is unlikely to have the blonde hair of it 's paternal grandmother , @entity23 , he said			1
the boy shares @entity32 's thin hair and ears , but also his blue eyes and @entity3 's darker colouring			1
the girl shares @entity3 's beauty with a heart - shaped face , striking blue eyes , and long dark hair good looking : @entity32 and @entity3 are an attractive couple and @entity9 based artist @entity8 has used computer - generated imagery to show how their best features could combine in their child mr @entity8 studied recent photographs of the couple and used the latest computer technology to predict how the child may look during their formative years			1
if the couple have a son , the boy is expected to inherit many of @entity32 's features			2
@entity8 has included the famous @entity58 ears and @entity32 's slightly receding hairline			1
a daughter is predicted to closer resemble @entity3 , with a high forehead , heart shaped face and long brown hair			2
the @entity58 ears : if the couple have a son , artist @entity8 says he will inherit @entity32 's features , including his hairline and slightly large ears			1
but mr @entity8 has also imagined him with @entity3 's colouring and complexion			2
the controversial image bears little resemblance to the prince as a baby ( right ) there are some similarities between mr @entity8 ' mock up of the couple 's child as a girl ( left ) and @entity3 as a child ( right ) , most markedly the face shape , piercing blue eyes , and rosy cheeks in the past he has taken the faces of other well known couples and imagined how their children may look , and has carried out magazine work where he ' ages ' celebrities such @entity92 and @entity91			1
but it seems some people are not so hopeful for the couple 's offspring			2
popular website @entity100 creator @entity99 has taken @entity32 and @entity3 's more ' unique ' features and morphed them into what they would look like combined			2
and less flattering images are a far departure from the glossy @entity107 images released by mr @entity8 - showing a child with thinner hair and slightly protruding ears			1
while they are not as polished as those produced by the @entity107 artist , they do still bear a striking resemblance to the couple as children			2
less flattering : the @entity119 take on the couple 's child uses some of their more unique features , but still has porcelain skin and deep blue eyes			1
this interpretation appears to bear more of a resemblance to @entity32 the @entity2 and @entity3 had been hoping to keep the news they were expecting a baby to themselves until christmas day			2
but after @entity3 was admitted to hospital with extreme morning sickness , sparked by a rare condition called @entity132 ( @entity133 ) , they had little choice but to make the announcement			0
@entity3 , 30 , who is thought to be between six and eight weeks pregnant , was taken to the hospital just after lunch on sunday by her husband and put on a drip to stop her becoming dehydrated			0
but the news delighted millions around the world – including their own families			0
sources say she appeared to be responding well to treatment and there was ‘ no cause for alarm ’			0
however , doctors at the @entity150 in central @entity151 have taken the precautionary step of keeping her in for the next few days			0
@entity8 is a highly respected forensic artist based in @entity9			1
he trained as a graphic designer before joining police doing both age progressions of missing children and facial reconstruction from the skull			0
his work has helped trace countless missing children over the 11 years he has worked in forensics			0
but when he is not hard at work in the serious day job , he enjoys creating ' fun but scientific forecasts ' forecasting how celebrities will look when they are older and how their children might look			0
mr @entity8 said he took recent pictures of the @entity2 and @entity3 , and took account of their colouring , and predominant genes and outstanding features , such as @entity3 's olive skin , @entity32 's ears , and their clear complexions			1
while he tries to make then as ' cute as possible ' he says it is all highly scientific			0
he said the future king or queen of @entity182 was bound to be ' adorable ' and added : ' for @entity3 and @entity32 's baby - i think there is a lot of good genes in the mix there			2
' there is a science behind the process			0
the darker features are more dominant with @entity3 's olive skin and dark hair			1
i would say you are not going to get a fair skinned baby with blonde hair and blue eyes - like @entity23			1
' he added : ' over the years i have done lots of different celebrities			0
' i did @entity204 and @entity92 when they were married and i have done a few of @entity91			0
' when i did @entity206 and @entity207 i did the child as a boy , but the image actually does look a lot like @entity212			2
' my day job means i have acquired a skill which means it is always in the ball park			0
' i was inspired after seeing some other versions of celebrities children that were done			0
i remember thinking ' those things look scary			0
i could do something more accurate			0
' my interpretation of @entity222 's son @entity221 ( son from her first marriage to @entity225 sinegr @entity226 ) was pretty much spot on			0
' it 's all forensic art based on family hereditary going backward to make these fun baby images or forward to depict what children will look like now and get them back home to where they belong			1

@entity8 takes best features of @entity238 couple to imagine child 's face
images *suggest* boy or girl will have dark hair , blue eyes and olive skin
@entity9 - based artists *suggest*s child could be royal beauty
but baby boy will not escape ' the famous family ears ' , he says
