by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson former @entity2 midfielder @entity1 will leave @entity4 champions @entity3 next month and wants a @entity6 swansong at @entity7			1
the 33 - year - old midfielder was an integral part of @entity11 ’s side this season but his contract is up and @entity3 feel they already have the next big thing in @entity4 football ready to step into his place			1
@entity18 is an under - 19 @entity19 champion with @entity20 and @entity3 already have him tied to the club until 2017			1
last year they sent him out on loan at @entity24 but next season he will return to take his place in the centre of midfield ousting @entity1			1
moving on : @entity3 midfielder @entity1 is set to leave the club on a free transfer next month @entity31 bound ? @entity1 is keen on a return to @entity2 , where he spent one season under @entity34 in 2004 - 05 but the @entity36 midfielder who played for @entity34 in the 2004 - 05 season could make an emotional return to @entity31 having shown this season he still has plenty to offer			1
he was in tears when he left @entity2 for @entity41 in 2005 for £ 6.5million having decided , against his coach ’s wishes , to look for more regular first team starts elsewhere			2
' @entity34 is someone who knows exactly what to say to his players in any given moment			2
he never consults the players because he is the one who takes responsibility ; he is the figurehead and it ’s a role he plays better than anyone , ' said @entity1 about his former coach earlier in the season as he prepared to face his old club in the @entity58 semi-finals			2
' there are a lot of similarities between him and @entity11			2
in fact in terms of the winning mentality that comes through every day they are not similar they are identical			0
bright future : @entity3 youngster @entity18 has been tipped to step up and replace @entity1 next season reunion : @entity1 would relish the opportunity to work under @entity34 again ' i had an unforgettable year at @entity2			1
my departure was a little bit sad			0
it was my decision to leave			0
i felt it was best for me			0
it was a little bit against what @entity34 and the rest of the team wanted but @entity80 in @entity41 wanted me and was ringing me every day telling me to come to @entity41			0
it was a chance to go somewhere where i would be playing every week			0
' if @entity1 does make a return to @entity7 it could boost the number of @entity3 players arriving at the club this summer to three with @entity87 likely to return from his loan spell and @entity89 also wanted by @entity34			1
@entity1 has no doubts what @entity2 will be getting if they can take @entity87 as their number one keeper for the next campaign			1
he said : ' he ’s the best in the world at the moment as far as i ’m concerned			0
he transmits an incredible sense of security to the team			0
he ’s just a kid but you look at him filling the goal and it just puts you at ease			0
' wanted man : @entity2 are keen to sign @entity3 striker @entity89 ( left ) this summer			2

@entity1 is out of contract and will leave the @entity4 champions
@entity11 *believes* 19 - year - old @entity18 can take @entity1 *'s* place
