by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 07:34 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:19 est , 25 february 2014 among the high - profile launches at this week ’s @entity6 , a security firm disrupted the event with a smartphone built entirely around encryption			1
the @entity10 is an @entity12 - based handset built by @entity14 manufacturer @entity13 alongside security experts @entity15 and @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
everything , from the custom - built @entity19 to web browsing and apps , are encrypted , or have been fitted with an extra layer of security			1
when the phone boots up it asks for a password and pin before a wizard guides users through the security options			1
for example , it shows users which apps want access to which data			1
the @entity10 owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share			1
@entity54 , chief architect from @entity10 told @entity55 the smartphone was designed to have ‘ the benefit of security without having to have an in - depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure			1
’ the company says that it is ' anti-personal data from the ground up '			1
they say the phone will appeal will appeal to those who do n't want any data collection , those who agree with principle of collecting data and businessmen @entity54 continued that there are existing products , such as @entity74 , that lets customers communicate securely to each other , but ‘ @entity10 extends this concept to everyone			2
’ ‘ we 're anti-personal data from the ground up			0
' there are a number of people this handset will appeal to ; there 's the people who do n't want any data collection			2
' there are people concerned about data collection for data collection sake			0
' then there are people concerned about secondary data collection , such as business men who want to communicate securely while travelling - they want to be as anonymous as they want to be			2
‘ today , once data is collected somewhere it 's only a subpoena away for the authorities			0
we explicitly do n't collect data and it 's architected so it ca n't fulfil subpoenas			0
’ the encryption on the @entity10 extends to voice calls , video calls , voicemail , texting , file transfer and storage , web browsing and apps			1
this encryption is done via the @entity15 and @entity112 privacy and security software			1
subscriptions are included for two years with the @entity10 , and they can then be @entity115 , customers can upgrade to the next - generation @entity10 handset			1
the phone costs $ 629 ( £ 376 ) plus delivery			2
@entity10 claims the price for all the individual services totals $ 1508 ( £ 903 )			0
the mobile has a 4.7 - inch hd ips display , although the precise resolution is yet to be announced			2
it also comes with a a @entity127 quad - core processor , @entity128 of storage , an 8 - megapixel camera and @entity131			2
everything , from the custom - built @entity19 to web browsing and apps , are encrypted , or have been fitted with an extra layer of security			1
internet access on the phone is carried out through a virtual private network ( @entity30 ) that sends and receives data in a way that ’s designed to keep it hidden			2
when the phone boots up it asks for a password and pin before a wizard guides users through the security options			1
for example , it shows users which apps want access to which data			2
the @entity10 owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share			0
@entity54 , chief architect from @entity10 told @entity55 the smartphone was designed to have ‘ the benefit of security without having to have an in - depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure			1
’ although the company touts the benefits of the device , there is the possibility handsets such as @entity10 will be used by criminals to hide their activity			0
when asked to address these concerns , @entity10 ’s managing director , @entity179 told @entity55 : ‘ the availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief			0
' if you ’re a bad guy , the fact [ @entity10 ] is making cryptography usable does n’t mean you ’re going to take that a step further ; you 're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either			0
’ @entity187 is the latest firm to launch a phone with a fingerprint scanner to improve security on its new @entity191 , following @entity193 ’s lead last year			1
@entity179 said that @entity193 made biometrics fashionable , but that does n’t mean it ’s the best way to protect your data			0
‘ we have plans for a whole family of @entity204 and we 'll see which security measures , such as biometrics , have legs and which are legitimate			0
we want to introduce something people can use , that ’s easy , simple and familiar			0
’ @entity54 added that the company decided to run the @entity208 on top of @entity12 because it means users can install any @entity12 app , and @entity10 will support private features with it			1
@entity214 , director of @entity215 , told @entity55 that the revelations that we are increasingly being tracked online , it was only a matter of time before companies started to promote themselves as being privacy friendly			0
' everyone from lawyers to people with sensitive illnesses are concerned about how safe their information is on their devices , so technology that enables both security and privacy will undoubtedly be popular , ' he said			0
' the longer the legal framework around surveillance fails to reflect the modern world , the more people will rely on technology to protect their privacy			0
' it is clear that previously trusted systems are far less secure than we thought , as encryption has been undermined and private companies secretly compelled to turn over information in bulk on users , so this phone is the first step to restoring the balance where people ’s data is not collected unless they are under suspicion			0
