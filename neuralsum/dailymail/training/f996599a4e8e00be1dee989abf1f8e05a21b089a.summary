a super-mall and tourism complex proposed for the @entity2 would include fast food chains , hotels , gift shops and a gondola to take those who do n’t want to hike or ride a mule to its bottom			1
one of the @entity10 , the @entity2 has a problem with bringing in cash from the millions of tourist who visit it every year			0
but the entrepreneurs behind the proposed @entity17 will give visitors greater access and ability to marvel at nature 's handiwork over the past two billion or so years			1
unspoiled : the @entity2 could soon have a mega-mall with fast food chains and hotels easy - access : a 1.4 - mile gondola could transport 4,000 tourists to the bottom of the canyon each day what where : elements of the designs currently up for approval by the @entity35 nation plans : hotels , restaurants , retail outlets and a cultural visitor centre are among elements of the proposal the project , currently being reviewed by @entity35 tribal government , would be built on 420 acres next to what is known as the @entity46 , where the @entity48 and @entity49 meet			1
developer @entity50 also plans a cultural centre , amphitheatre and an elevated 1,900ft - long walkway along the river 's edge			0
at present the routes down to the bottom include mule rides , hiking , rafts from other areas or helicopters for the well - heeled , but investors argue the development would bring a greater appreciation and access to the majesty of the place			0
their figures claim the majority of the canyon ’s five million tourists each year spending less than an hour admiring its edge before moving on – they say a 1.4 - mile tramway could transport about 4,000 visitors to the bottom every day where the layer of @entity79 is among the most ancient exposed rock on earth			2
cultural : the developers explain the virtues of the deluxe restaurant , cultural centre and art studios take a stroll : plans for the 1,900ft - long walkway along the river 's edge the proposal also says the project would bring 3,200 jobs in for the @entity35 , whose greatest cultural issue is unemployment			1
not surprisingly , there is fierce opposition to the plans with some opposed to any building on sacred land , the commercialising one of the world ’s most iconic natural landmarks and the potential damage additional tourism could do to the park ’s ecosystem			2
in 2007 , the less ambitious @entity109 at @entity109 , run by the @entity111 nation , faced a battle before they opened a controversial glass bridge that jutted out over the rim but it largely been viewed as a success and provided a financial shot in the arm for the area 's caretakers			0
overlooking : the skywalk on the @entity122 of the @entity2 was a controversial addition to the canyon do look down : the glass - bottomed ledge offers a unique attraction to visitors			0

@entity17 would keep tourists at attraction longer
developers say most visitor spend less than an hour at canyon
proposed complex would include shopping , dining and *accommodation*
plans are under review by the @entity35 nation , caretakers of the land
