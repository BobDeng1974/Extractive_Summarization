the @entity1 administration is drawing fire for suggesting that defeating @entity3 requires more of a jobs program for terrorists than a sophisticated approach to killing them			1
@entity10 spokeswoman @entity9 said monday night on @entity11 that ' we can not win this war by killing them , we can not kill our way out of this war			1
' instead , she said , the administration should ' go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups ' – including ' lack of opportunity for jobs			1
' ' we can work with countries around the world to help improve their governance , ' @entity9 insisted			2
' we can help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people			0
' the embarrassing gaffe aired as the @entity33 attracted new criticism for papering over religious aspects of a mass - beheading of @entity37 by the @entity3 terror army			1
@entity33 press secretary @entity64 issued a 192 - word reaction condemning the brutal killings as ' despicable ' and ' cowardly ' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims			1
the words ' @entity72 , ' ' @entity71 ' and ' @entity74			2
' were not included in @entity64 's statement			2
the video itself was titled ' a message signed with blood to the @entity80			0
' the slaughtered men , clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of @entity84 detainee garb , were described as ' crusaders			0
' one of the men was seen praying just moments before his throat was slit			0
the @entity33 convened a conference with representatives from more than 60 countries on tuesday on a subject it calls ' countering violent extremism			1
' like @entity64 's statement , administration officials connected with the event have studiously avoided any mention of radical @entity71 or its animosity toward @entity53 and @entity98			1
' we are not treating these people as part of a religion , ' a senior administration official said monday during a conference call with reporters			1
' we 're treating them as terrorists			0
we call them our enemies and we ’ll be treating them as such			0
' world leaders outside of @entity111 have leapt to connect @entity3 , the self - described @entity112 , with a religious battle that pits @entity71 against the world 's other great religions			1
the 21 copts , ' were killed simply for the fact that they were @entity53 , ' @entity54 said monday at the @entity118 , speaking in his native @entity119			1
@entity120 : the five - minute @entity3 video released on sunday was captioned : ' the people of the cross , followers of the hostile @entity125 church ' ; one of the terrorists ( center ) boasted that ' safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for ' @entity132 in @entity133 : republicans including @entity136 rep. @entity135 are growing more frustrated with a @entity33 that steadfastly refuses to frame the @entity3 battle in religious terms ' the blood of our christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out to be heard			1
it makes no difference whether they be @entity146 , @entity147 , copts or @entity149			0
they are @entity53 ! ' @entity152 prime minister @entity151 said he was ' appalled by the murder of @entity53 in @entity57 , a simply barbaric and inhumane act			2
' ' our efforts to defeat the monstrosity of @entity159 extremism must not waver			0
' a @entity162 / @entity161 poll found 57 per cent of @entity163 disapprove of how president @entity1 is handling the threat posed by @entity3			2
even among @entity165 , 46 per cent say @entity163 's battle with @entity3 is going badly			1
public approval of the administration 's @entity169 efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since september			0
part of that slide may be due to the @entity10 's focus on what conservatives deride as ' hashtag diplomacy ' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away @entity3 's glamorous appeal to would - be jihadis			1
the @entity183 reported monday that @entity112 is engaged in a broad effort through its @entity185 to coordinate all the government 's social media resources in response to nearly 100 @entity189 accounts blasting @entity191 recruiting messages into the @entity193 's digital ether			2
' we 're getting beaten on volume , so the only way to compete is by aggregating , curating and amplifying existing content , ' under secretary of state @entity194 told the @entity183			0
' these guys are n't @entity200 , ' @entity194 said			0
' they 're not invincible in social media			0
' but @entity205 director told a @entity207 hearing last week that ' the government is probably not the best platform to try to communicate with the set of actors who are potentially vulnerable to this kind of propaganda and this kind of recruitment			0
' ' we try to find ways to stimulate this kind of counternarrative , this kind of countermessaging , without having a @entity163 government hand in it			0
