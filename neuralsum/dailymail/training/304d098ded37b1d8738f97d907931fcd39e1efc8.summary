' what are you doing ? ' he exclaims as @entity13 narrowly misses his digits			1
' my fingers are there mate			0
' the dynamic kitchen duo then gently fry the raw ingredients in the pan , with @entity13 tossing the cooked ingredients as @entity22 adds generous spoonfuls of cumin and garam masala to the mixture			2

chefs in the making : @entity13 tosses the raw ingredients in the frying pan as @entity22 watches @entity22 and @entity13 dish up their respective tortilla stacks to their mystery dates the competition kicks up a notch when it 's time to assemble the tortilla stacks			1
@entity13 's precise stacking skills come to the fore as he carefully spreads his keema on the tortilla before sprinkling on the cheese			1
' tortilla down , ' he says , placing it on the baking tray			2
he then spreads the mince before laying another pancake on the top			2
' the trick to this is not to put too much filling , ' @entity22 advises as @entity13 carefully lays another pancake on his pile before starting the the process again			2
