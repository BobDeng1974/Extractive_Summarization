by @entity0 last updated at 2:24 pm on 13th july 2011 it ’s official in america - men diagnosed with cancer are more likely to die from most types of the disease than women			0
the difference in rates was due to a higher initial risk and later detection , according to a @entity12 government study			1
the @entity14 study found the highest male - to - female mortality rate ratios were for mouth , larynx and hypopharynx cancers			1
hospital : men diagnosed with cancer and more likely to die from the disease than women - due to a higher initial risk and later detection , an official study said the study looked at a database of 36 different types of cancer from 1977 to 2006			1
more than 5.5 men died from mouth cancer for every woman , 5.4 from cancer of the larynx and 4.5 for hypopharynx cancer , reported @entity36			1
for lung cancer , which is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women , the research found 2.3 male deaths for each female death			1
the main reason for the difference is that men are more at risk of developing cancer to begin with , the study 's lead investigator said			2
@entity51 is an investigator in the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the @entity14			2
the average lifetime chance a man will develop lung cancer is about one in 13 , or one in 16 for a woman , the @entity55 says			1
@entity12 men are more likely than women to have advanced disease by the time their cancer is diagnosed , mr @entity51 said			0
waiting line : more than 5.5 men died from mouth cancer for every woman , 5.4 from cancer of the larynx and 4.5 for hypopharynx cancer , the study showed he said gender differences in exposure to carcinogens - including tobacco smoke and viral infections - play a role in the rate disparity			2
‘ @entity83 ’ mechanisms , such as sex chromosomes and hormones , were cited and may contribute to observed sex differences in cancer incidence			0
the @entity14 researchers said there was no single root cause for the disparity			0
but influences include differences in behaviour of the tumour , cancer screening for people without symptoms and presence of other illnesses			0
a recent survey conducted by @entity100 found that 28 per cent of men do not visit the doctor regularly .			0
