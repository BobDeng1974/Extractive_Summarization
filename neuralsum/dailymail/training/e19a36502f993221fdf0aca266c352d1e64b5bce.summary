an eyewitness had been looking out onto the park when he saw the teenager being lured into some bushes by a stranger and went out to intervene			1
the man came across the girl 's father , who was already looking for her			2
they both went into the nearby park and saw the teenager and @entity0 , but he fled when the girl 's father chased after him			1
initially the girl said the stranger had just touched her			2
she later told police she had met a ' naughty man ' who told her to kiss him and take her clothes off before she was made to perform a sex act on him			2
police later established several people had seen the victim sitting on a low wall with a stranger at 8.24pm , shortly before she was seen on the playing field			0
judge @entity103 ( pictured ) told @entity0 : ' you lack remorse and any insight into the consequences of your offending on others ' the stranger on the wall was described as similar to the man the girl 's father had chased and eyewitnesses said he had been wearing a hi vis jacket and had been drinking beer			1
@entity27 captured @entity0 going in to a local shop to buy beer in his hi viz jacket			1
@entity0 was arrested on june 11 but claimed that after leaving work he had gone home , had a lot to drink and had not gone out again			1
mr @entity75 said : ' significantly , he adamantly denied he was wearing a yellow hi - vis jacket that day and maintained he had never been issued with that kind of jacket			2
' he was re-interviewed when officers received statements from several people who had seen @entity0 sat on the wall			2
he maintained he was n't the attacker but was later picked out by a witness during an identification parade			2
police then spoke to his workmates , supervisor and project co-ordinator			0
mr @entity75 told the court : ' they readily established he did have a yellow hi vis jacket and in fact was issued with it that day			2
' they also established his jacket had disappeared by the following morning by the time he arrived at work			0
it has never been found			0
' ' the defendant insisted it was n't him and ultimately tried to point the finger in the direction of what he described as " @entity154 gangs " hanging around in the area			0
' @entity0 's mobile phone and the laptop he shared with his mother were seized			2
when officers analysed the phone and computer , they found he had made extensive use of two messaging functions , @entity9 and @entity10			0
mr @entity75 said : ' in the early hours of the morning of the day the victim was raped , he sent really vast amounts of sexually themed messages to a wide range of women who were apparently strangers , or at most online acquaintances			1
' he had at least 10 specific sexual conversations , trying to meet for sex or have a webcam session and all of these exchanges ended in frustration			0
' about 15 minutes after the girl was raped , he resumed contact and carried on contacting numerous women to make small talk , but also to talk about sex			1
' @entity0 has 37 previous offences on his record dating back to 2004			1
at the time of the rape he was subject to a domestic violence suspended prison sentence for assaulting his partner as she held a baby			1
the court heard the probation service found him to have a ' poor attitude towards women			1
' @entity60 @entity60 , in @entity12 ( pictured ) heard the horrific ordeal has ' destroyed ' the girl 's family in mitigation defence counsel @entity195 said : ' the only major mitigation is that he has pleaded guilty			2
' he is facing up to the reality of the offences themselves			0
' this was an opportunist offence			0
it was committed within , what must be fair to say , a small window of opportunity			0
' it 's a terrible offence in itself , but it 's a one - off situation			0
' there 's no history or anything that would indicate that it 's likely to occur again , significantly			0
' there 's certainly a lack of maturity on his part , certainly in dealing with women			0
' there 's no doubt that there will follow a very substantial prison sentence and of course he knows that that will be the outcome			0
' passing sentence judge @entity103 told @entity0 : ' you lack remorse and any insight into the consequences of your offending on others			2
' it would have been immediately obvious to you that she was very vulnerable and that 's no doubt why you led her into the park and did what you did to her			0
' it 's clear at the time you were sexually frustrated as you had been seeking instant gratification over social media			0
' ' your offending has destroyed everything the victim 's family had been working for			0
' you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself			0
this is a long sentence and rightly so			0
