reading boss @entity0 has revealed he did not watch the @entity2 semi-final draw as he refuses to look beyond monday 's sixth - round replay against @entity4			1
the @entity5 will welcome @entity7 's side to the @entity8 on monday night , with the winner progressing into the final four to face cup - holders @entity10 at @entity11			1
a goalless draw at @entity13 in the original tie means the draw was made following @entity10 's win at @entity17 but before a replay could decide who would face the @entity20			1
reading manager @entity0 reveals he did not watch the @entity2 semi-final draw @entity5 and @entity4 played out a goalless draw in the @entity2 quarter - final last weekend and @entity0 , who made nine changes to his side that lost 4 - 1 at @entity25 in their @entity27 clash on saturday , insists he can not entertain the idea of a @entity11 date as he pays full respect to @entity4			1
' i did n't watch the draw , ' he said			1
' a friend texted me telling me we had drawn @entity10 , but i never intended on watching it			0
' i do n't think it ( the draw ) makes any difference whatsoever			2
i think the game against @entity4 is big enough in its own right and the reward of getting through to an @entity2 semi-final is big enough in its own right			1
so i do n't think the semi-final opposition makes a difference to either team			2
' before there is any talk of semi-finals you have to get through to the quarter - final and that 's what we intend to do			1
' what 's the point of thinking about a game that is not there ? you have to think about the game coming up and it 's a very difficult game for us against a very good @entity4 team			1
' @entity62 ( centre ) got @entity25 off to a dream start against @entity5 by scoring inside a minute @entity65 ( right ) also scored as @entity25 beat @entity5 4 - 1 on saturday afternoon despite a potential meeting with @entity68 's @entity2 winners , @entity0 believes his squad must be targeting their own success in this season 's competition rather than just hoping for a @entity11 day out against @entity10			1
' to get to @entity11 does n't excite me , to get to the @entity2 semi-final does , ' he said			1
that 's the key for me			0
one more step in the cup would be nice			0
to get to @entity11 is just another game , there are no prizes for it			0
' the final goal of any competition is to pick up the silver trophy at the end of it			2
this is just another step on the way to the final			2
that 's how you have to look at every round and that 's how we have looked at every round			0
' it 's not to get excited about a semi-final			2
in a semi-final there is no trophy , there are no medals			2
it 's much better to put down on your cv that you have got a cup winners medal or you 've lifted a trophy			0
' that has to be the ambition			0
the ambition can not be to reach the semi-final at @entity11 , it has to be to lift the trophy			0
' that is the mindset i have to give them			0
that 's the mindset you have to have			0
if you 're satisfied to reach a semi-final then that 's not correct			0
