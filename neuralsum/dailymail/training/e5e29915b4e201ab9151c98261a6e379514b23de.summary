by @entity0 yesterday , my baby son reached the grand old age of 40			1
how did that happen ? you know , one minute you 're looking at your first child and wondering what to do with ' it ' - and the next you 're watching him blow out a very large number of candles			1
we 've been through a lot together , my boy and i and , in truth , i owe the greatest gift of my life to him			1
all of us read a lot ( too much ? ) about the stresses and strains of motherhood , about mums who feel bored by the chores and long to get back to work			1
fathers and mothers are rightly concerned about what they can and should teach their children , and manuals for parenthood proliferate on the shelves			1
birthday boy : @entity0 with her son @entity33 on his 40th but what of those instinctive lessons our babies teach us ? it was my @entity33 who taught me how to be a mother before he could speak - and i rejoice that those lessons in love have never ended			1
i 'd be lying if i said i wanted to be pregnant			1
in fact , when i got the news , i felt like a plane that had been hijacked and was heading for an unknown , scary destination			1
back in 1973 , i 'd been married to my first husband , @entity48 , for five years already but was enjoying my life as a journalist - about - town , wild at heart and eager to pack a bag and travel when the story needed it			1
i 'd never held a baby and did n't want to			1
when i discovered i was pregnant , and on the hunt for tips , i watched my sister - in - law change her daughter @entity60 's nappy			1
i thought the whole business daunting and revolting in equal measure			1
refusing to acknowledge what was happening , i took risks			1
though pregnant , i still took a job as a presenter at the first @entity69 commercial radio station , @entity68			1
reluctant mother : but @entity0 embraced her role once @entity33 arrived it was very chaotic and i 'd never presented a live radio show before , but i accepted the stress because i refused to give in to the changes in my body			1
not for me relaxing into pregnancy : i drank wine because nobody told me not to , and stayed up as late as i ever had			1
how stupid i was ! unhappy , exhausted and irresponsible , i felt entirely unready for motherhood			1
@entity83 was born on january 8 , 1974 , weighing just 4lb 13oz			2
with his low birth weight and jaundice , he was in the @entity86 , keeping me ( somewhat weepy ) in hospital for 12 days			2
i believed it was all my fault , but remember wanting to do everything for him			2
i surprised myself , confidently bathing his tiny slippery limbs as if i 'd been doing it all my life			2
or perhaps the bookish girl turned tough - talking lady journalist had actually been practising in her dreams for the role that fitted with surprising ease			2
' nobody ever tells you how hard it is to bring up a child - and how anything that goes wrong feels entirely your fault ' i fell in love with my son in a way that was entirely new			2
you 've loved your parents and then that @entity111 and then the man you married ... but nothing like this ! the apricot smell of @entity83 's head melted my heart into a different shape , like wax in the hands of an artist			2
alone for much of the time , because my husband 's job as a television reporter took him far away for weeks on end , i became fascinated by nappies , bottles and baby clothes			2
each day i would put @entity83 in his carrycot and push him all the way across @entity133 simply to visit the good chemist and pore over dummies and jingling toys			2
who would have thought it ? i 'm not saying i never chafed , never wished i could meet friends to smoke and drink too much in a @entity141 pub in the old way , never wanted to kick over the traces and be free			2
but the rebellious voice was drowned by the coos and cries of my son			2
i felt somehow that i was getting it right with him - and that seemed as great an achievement as my degree or my first big byline in a national paper			2
his ready smiles were my reward , his first word - ' @entity159 ' - like music			0
even though i was unavoidably living like a single mother a lot of the time , thanks to my husband 's job , and missed him terribly ( he was as besotted with our son as @entity166 ) , i discovered that a baby can be a real companion			0
some days it felt like just @entity83 and me against the world			0
he was my consolation , too			0
in november 1975 i gave birth to my second son , who was stillborn after a long , grim labour			0
i 'd been hospitalised for two or three weeks and so my parents had taken @entity83			0
when my mother arrived after i had been released , i sobbed to her : ' i want my baby			1
' at that very moment , @entity83 , who was not yet two , toddled into the room and his face lit up as he said , ' @entity180 ! ' with an air of purest wonder			0
' here is your baby , ' said my mother			0
but nobody ever tells you how hard it is to bring up a child - and how anything that goes wrong feels entirely your fault			0
devoted : bel with her son when he was aged five i look back over the years of the adorable , smiling , trouble - free baby , the sweet little boy , the insecure 12 - year - old who was so helpful at home - and wonder how he became that rebellious teenager and even more wayward young man			1
gosh , they put you through it ! my beloved baby became a wild , bad , lazy creature and behaved appallingly at one time , yet somehow or other he 'd deliver that enormous grin and careless apology , and be forgiven			0
as the mothers of @entity208 gangsters might say : ' my boy was always good to ' is muvver			1
' not academic at all , he dropped out of university with various problems and this was a very tough time indeed , but his father and i were determined he should n't feel a failure			1
so he did a chef 's course , which led in time to a trial as a runner on the television programme @entity222			0
willing to take on the most mundane tasks with that ready grin , @entity83 worked his way up the ladder to become a producer - director , working with @entity228 among others			0
oh yes , mothers remember all the anxiety and some of the heartbreak , too ; you can still remember the anguish at failed relationships ; you can wax sentimental over treasured keepsakes yet still feel a spurt of angry frustration at his wasted chances and poor judgment			0
i can still feel irritated by his failings , like his inability to give up nicotine , but he is still impossible to be angry with but then you realise that all those stages created the whole person , transforming him into the man he is			0
and when my marriage broke up in 2003 it was my children who shared the grief and offered the most comfort			0
they took care of me - and that does n't come from nowhere			1
that 's a result of the whole miraculous process of mothering : the learning and loving that is a two - way street			0
therefore , i would change nothing			0
sometimes i tell @entity83 i am proud of him , and he looks amused and disbelieving as he wonders why			0
it 's because he 's always had the courage to remake his life - earning the love of a wonderful girl ( now his wife ) and becoming a devoted father , even though he once told me he did n't want children			1
through the years : mother and son when @entity33 was 17 when he realised that his life at the sharp end of tv was harming him and possibly his new relationship , he came up with a brilliant idea for reinvention			1
passionate about vws and food in equal measure , he located a very rare 1964 ice cream van and set up his own business			0
now he and his wife are the @entity281 , living a carefree but hardworking life serving delicious ice - cream at festivals , events and weddings , and expanding each year			0
and 40 years after that baby boy took over my life , he is still making demands			1
we share space at home , since he and his wife and baby son live next door to us in the countryside outside @entity297			0
i have to tolerate his growing fleet of vehicles , just as i once had to put up with the toy cars that littered the house			0
i can still feel irritated by his failings , like his inability to give up nicotine , but he is still impossible to be angry with			0
and , hearing the ice clink into the bucket and the corks pop , i know he is still the person with whom , apart from his sister @entity308 , i most like to party			0
what more can a mother say ? so happy birthday , @entity83 - and thanks for teaching me so much			0
and for the fun .			0

@entity316 had n't planned to fall pregnant
but she embraced motherhood once @entity33 arrived
he was a sweet boy who became a terrible teen
he and @entity0 have always been there for one another
