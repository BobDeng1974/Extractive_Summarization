' @entity0 scales ' could be the key to the rehabilitation of patients suffering from eating disorders			0
a recent study has found that 75 per cent of patients treated using the @entity7 method were free of symptoms one year later			0
the @entity10 method sees patients re-learn normal eating behaviour by using a feedback device attached to a scale			1
success story : the @entity15 weighs the food on the plate and tells the patient at what speed they should be eating			1
it also asks them to register how full they feel , re-training normal eating behaviour the @entity15 food scale is attached to a computer which tells the patient how much they should be eating and how full they should feel to achieve normal eating habits			1
the patient places their plate on the scale and puts their allocated food on the plate			1
as the patient eats , the computer registers the speed they eat and the patient puts in how full he or she is feeling throughout the meal			1
if the patient is eating too slowly , the computer registers this and tells them to speed up , aiming to finish the meal in 15 minutes			1
the registered feeling of fullness is shown as a second curve , with the aim of following a ' normal ' pattern			0
the goal is to re-train the brain , and to see the patient return to a normal eating behaviour within three to four months			2
good work : a recent study has found that 75 per cent of patients treated using the @entity58 method were in remission 12.5 months later once patients normalise eating patterns they no longer feel rewarded for eating less or purging , targeting the psychiatric symptoms behind the eating disorder			0
the new study , published in the @entity66 ' journal @entity67 , found that within 12.5 months on average , 75 per cent of all patients were free of symptoms and only ten per cent of patients relapsed over five years			0
‘ this follow - up on 18 years of work show that treatment on a neurobiological base is effective ’ , says @entity70 , professor of behavioural neuroendocrinology at @entity72 's @entity71			0
the device can also be used in reverse , teaching people who are overweight not to eat too fast			2
just three years ago , the @entity80 bought several @entity81 to use to tell people to eat slower and to remind them to think if they are feeling full .			2

@entity10 *invention* used to re-train the brain on how to eat normally
the @entity15 is a scale for your plate , connected to a computer
it registers how much food is on the plate and how fast you eat
it also asks you to register how full you feel , to *encourage* normal *satiation*
