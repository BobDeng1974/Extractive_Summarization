by @entity0 and @entity1 professor @entity2 carried out the ground - breaking research at @entity6 's @entity5 's hospital two men who were @entity8 - positive appear to be virus - free after bone marrow transplants , marking the first successful cases of @entity8 being cleared in @entity11			1
both men now register undetectable levels of the virus after treatment in @entity6 , according to the @entity18 's @entity17 director , professor @entity2			1
in a significant breakthrough for researchers , one of the patients cleared the virus without donor marrow containing a rare gene mutation that protects against @entity8			1
the human immunodeficiency virus , which causes @entity27 , became undetectable in both patients about three years after their transplants , prof @entity2 said			2
the men , who were treated at @entity6 's @entity31 , in partnership with the @entity17 , remain on antiretroviral therapy			1
' we 're so pleased that both patients are doing reasonably well years after the treatment for their cancers and remain free of both the original cancer and the hiv virus , ' he said			0
the work was presented on saturday at the @entity42 an @entity43 , which is part of the 20th @entity45 in @entity46 , which opens on sunday			0
the patients ' success echoes that of @entity51 man @entity50 , the famous @entity52 patient , who has shown no signs of virus resurgence since he received a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare gene mutation conferring resistance to @entity8			1
the 20th @entity45 is set to begin in @entity46 on sunday this rare gene mutation , called @entity59 , makes stem cells naturally resistant to the virus			0
it is found in less than one per cent of @entity63 , mostly northern @entity64			0
in @entity66 , two other patients underwent similar bone marrow transplants in 2012 but the transplanted cells did not contain the rare gene mutation			1
in both cases , the virus returned after antiretroviral treatment was stopped			0
the first @entity6 patient underwent a bone marrow transplant in 2010 for non-hodgkin lymphoma			1
his donor had the mutation			0
however , the second man who underwent a procedure in 2011 for acute myeloid leukaemia was matched with a donor that did not have it			0
both men no longer showed any trace of the virus after a series of tests , prof @entity2 said			0
' this is another example of where the transplant can drive the amount of virus to levels that we simply can not detect , ' he said			0
@entity50 , known as the ' @entity94 ' , is currently the only person to have been cured of @entity27 ' but if we stopped the antiretroviral therapy , there would be a very strong chance that it would come back			2
' we 're trying to understand this strong @entity100 effect and understand where the virus might be hiding			0
' the @entity6 cases could lead to new approaches to treating , and ultimately eradicating @entity8 , he said			2
' @entity107 research is looking for a way to move forward and my view is that this is a very important clue , that an immune response produced by bone marrow transplantation has such a strong @entity100 effect , ' prof @entity2 said			1
' we 're going to use this as a model for cure research and see if we can develop some therapies that mimic what were doing with bone marrow transplantation			2
' the stem cell transplant procedure , however , is not a practical strategy for the majority of @entity8 patients , and the risk of mortality is up to 10 per cent , prof @entity2 says			2
' for someone with @entity8 , you certainly would not transplant them when they 've got an almost normal lifespan with antiretroviral therapy			1
' the men , who were treated at @entity6 's @entity31 , in partnership with the @entity17 , remain on antiretroviral therapy between two and five @entity8 positive patients required bone marrow transplants for cancer each year in @entity11 , he said			1
' it is very difficult to find a match for bone marrow donors			0
' and when a donor and recipient match was found , the chances of then having the one per cent of donors who had the protective gene was going to be very small , he said			0
prof @entity2 said there was a movement in the @entity8 cure community to try to identify these donors with the mutation and ask them to volunteer for bone marrow transplants for hiv - positive people			1

two hiv - positive men were treated at @entity6 's @entity160
they had bone marrow transplants and their @entity8 is now undetectable
professor @entity2 said these are the first successful cases of @entity8 being cleared in @entity11
both patients remain on antiretroviral therapy to *prevent* @entity8 coming back
