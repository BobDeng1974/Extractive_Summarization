by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 14:11 est , 3 march 2014 with her killer cheekbones , party girl demeanor and elusive personality , @entity2 has become a @entity7 icon			1
but what 's her secret to supermodel success ? her close friend and business partner sir @entity13 seems to think he has the answer			1
' the bottom line is this : she manages herself well , ' the entrepreneur told the @entity17			0
' she 's been smart , she understands the fashion business , she does n't go talking everywhere			1
and she has n't run off and put her name on everything			0
' power of knowledge : sir @entity13 has revealed @entity2 's secret to success , saying she does n't ' put her name everywhere ' perhaps sir @entity13 , who has once again got @entity2 on board to collaborate with his beloved @entity27 , has n't taken note of @entity2 's recent projects			1
she may have just hit the big 4 - 0 but @entity30 clearly is n't letting her age get in the way of her career if her recent work is anything to go by			0
the blonde was recently unveiled as the face of @entity40 's @entity39 campaign , @entity42 's @entity39 campaign , as well as the @entity44 campaign for @entity45 at the end of last year , she was announced as the face of @entity48 and even designed a range of smartphone accessories for @entity51			1
bigger than ever : at the age of 40 , @entity2 is still going strong and one of her most popular campaigns was with @entity48 last year a lucrative four year partnership with sir @entity13 at @entity27 , reported to have earned her more than £ 3million , ended in 2010 but she is back on board to design a new collection to be sold in 40 countries this year			1
and her hard work is certainly paying off			0
after twenty stellar years dominating the industry , @entity2 saw her earnings triple in 2012 alone			2
her total earnings as of october 2012 for the preceding year totalled £ 11.72 million - that 's nearly three times the amount she earned in 2011			0
@entity65 , senior lecturer and fashion expert at @entity67 , said : ' when @entity2 first appeared in magazines , she was a quirky antidote to the long legged doe eyed , perfect in every way type models that consumers were previously bombarded with			1
' @entity2 is unique and distinct in appearance preventing look - a- likes and making her stand out from the usual cloned models			2
' she has a natural " imperfect " yet unmistakable beauty which makes women relate to her and men believe her to be a more approachable ' girl next door ' than the unobtainable supermodels of old			0
busy year ahead : @entity2 , pictured with sir @entity13 , has also announced she will design a new collection for @entity27 she 's still got it ! @entity2 , who turned 40 this month , has been unveiled as the face of @entity40 's @entity39 campaign ' the shelf life of a model is short but @entity2 is more than a model : she is a brand , a @entity7 brand			1
' all good brands provide a security in the purchase ; you have bought the right thing			0
age and time only adds strength to the brand			0
this will ensure that while other models retire when the inevitable wrinkles start to appear ; the brand km continues to grow			0
' some would argue that @entity2 has put her name to too many products			2
one glossy magazine recently had four adverts featuring @entity2 in the first 25 per cent of the publication ' ' some would argue that @entity2 has put her name to too many products			2
one glossy magazine recently had four adverts featuring @entity2 in the first 25 per cent of the publication			0
' however , she is incredibly strategic in her choice of brands			0
they range from low - cost cosmetics ( affordable to young girls ) to mid-price tanning products ( attractive to all ages ) , then high - price luxury brands ( affordable to only a few - but aspiration to many ) , the one thing they have in common is that they are all credible brands			0
' this ensures that the brand @entity2 continues to be reliable to customers and reaches a broad spectrum of the market resulting in her longevity as a fashion icon			2
' sir @entity13 's comments came as he helped the secretary of state for education @entity130 unveil a scheme whereby 15 state schools will enjoy special treatment from his company @entity134			1
' he 's the only person i know who has both @entity136 and @entity2 on speed dial , ' @entity130 told the @entity17 of @entity13			1
