scorned : @entity1 , 45 , outside @entity3 's @entity2 , who has been told to pay her billionaire ex-husband 's £ 100,000 legal costs even though he was already married when they wed a woman who claims she was duped into a wedding with a billionaire who was already married has been ordered to pay him £ 100,000 , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity1 believed she married shipping magnate @entity13 in an elaborate ceremony in @entity15 where her feet were washed by village elders and a dowry was paid for her as a ‘ bride price ’			2
the couple had twins together , but mrs @entity1 then spent a decade pursuing the tycoon for financial support through the @entity25 courts – only to be told she would not get a penny because their wedding ceremony was invalid			0
instead , the 45 - year - old of @entity29 , @entity3 , was ordered to pay 80 per cent of mr @entity13 ’s legal costs for a series of complex court hearings , leaving her with an estimated £ 100,000 bill for lawyers ’ fees			1
mrs @entity1 went to the @entity36 yesterday in a bid to get the order overturned			0
the court heard she had ‘ limited means ’ while her ‘ husband ’ owned a string of @entity3 properties			0
the pair ‘ married ’ in 2002 and had twins , but mrs @entity1 discovered soon afterwards that mr @entity13 had already married a woman in @entity47 , @entity48			1
the court heard that having more than one wife is allowed under @entity15 law , but mrs @entity1 applied to the @entity25 courts in 2003 to have her marriage dissolved because of her husband ’s behaviour , and to force mr @entity13 to pay maintenance for their children			1
the @entity2 ordered she should be given £ 300,000 a year – but mr @entity13 went to the @entity15 courts and successfully argued that their wedding was invalid , because of his church marriage in @entity47			2
the court ruled that mrs @entity1 ’s was a ‘ non-marriage ’ , which meant precisely nothing in the eyes of the law			0
the @entity2 then ruled it could not hand over any of mr @entity13 ’s fortune because he was never legally married to mrs @entity1 , and that she should pay most of his legal costs			1
her lawyers branded that decision ‘ incomprehensible ’ and said she should be entitled to a payout			0
new life : mr @entity13 , left , has now married a third woman , @entity74 , right , with whom he has quadruplets barrister @entity76 , for mrs @entity1 , said : ‘ the wife says she was duped			1
she should be permitted to apply for financial relief in @entity79 by virtue of that marriage ceremony			0
’ since his split from mrs @entity1 , mr @entity13 has ended his 1974 @entity47 marriage and wed another woman , @entity85 , with whom he has quadruplets			1
ruling on mrs @entity1 ’s case , @entity88 judge @entity87 said he had ‘ real sympathy ’ for her position , adding : ‘ all the time the wife considered that she was married to her husband he was in fact married to another lady			2
’ however , he said he could not allow her to appeal over a divorce payout because ‘ there was no marriage on which @entity79 law could bite ’			0
he said he would allow her to appeal against the order that she should pay mr @entity13 ’s costs			2
lord @entity87 said it was arguable that the sum was unfair , adding : ‘ she has the sole care of the parties ’ children and is a lady of limited means			0

@entity1 claims she was ' duped ' into marrying magnate @entity109
mother of two of his children later discovered he already had wife from 1974
billionaire had marriage struck - out in @entity15 and @entity2 wo *n't* overrule
mrs @entity1 must pay his £ 100,000 costs after legal *battle* for cash support
mr @entity13 has ended both marriages and has now married for a third time
