sacked : @entity0 , 65 , claims she lost her £ 184,000 a year job and objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife a @entity7 lawyer who objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife to staff claims she lost her £ 184,000 a year job at ‘ chauvinistic ’ @entity12 because she refused to act like a woman who ‘ knows her place ’ , a tribunal heard yesterday			1
@entity0 , 65 , objected when @entity12 ’s head of portfolio management @entity18 showed junior women colleagues photographs of the full - frontal painting of his wife , @entity24 don dr @entity22			1
the asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the @entity30 and @entity31 economist , which was featured in an exhibition			1
but miss @entity0 told the @entity35 employment tribunal : ‘ many people found the picture awkward			1
the women did not know how to react or not to react			0
' it is unusual for a male boss to send to women on his staff a nude portrait with no context			1
’ @entity12 insists the almost life - size painting – which received publicity when it was shown at @entity35 ’s @entity47 last year – was meant as a ‘ challenge against the objectification of women ’			1
miss @entity0 denies suggestions by the firm that she was too aggressive and was always looking for issues to complain about			1
‘ some of the men in the office could not countenance the fact i was a woman who was assertive and forthright , ’ said @entity54 , who is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination			2
‘ they ignored or tolerated male behaviour which could perhaps be described as blameworthy			0
‘ i was seen as a woman who did not know her place			2
‘ the senior management team was overwhelmingly male			2
it was deeply hierarchical and highly respectful of authority			0
' when i thought something was important i would raise it , i could n’t fall into line regardless of the hierarchy			0
‘ i was forthright while being caring and considerate of others , i had a strong personality and was respected by members of staff and was a mentor and adviser to more junior members of staff			0
’ sacked lawyer 's claim : @entity18 is said to have shown junior women colleagues photographs of the full - frontal painting of his wife miss @entity0 joined @entity12 in 2007 as head of the investments legal team and within four years was earning £ 135,000 a year and picking up annual bonuses of £ 49,000			1
she said she was perceived as aggressive because she was forthright in her emails , using red and capitals , which she did not realise until later was considered shouting			0
she complained of victimisation last year after alleging she had not been given a proper chance to apply for a promotion			0
but she was fired after an independent investigation ordered by the human resources department found no evidence of sex discrimination or bullying , the tribunal heard			0
miss @entity0 , who lives in @entity105 , said : ‘ that was at the end of my career			2
i was 65 and believed i could have worked until 70			0
‘ it hurt me very deeply i was dismissed when i had gone out of my way to treat people with respect and dignity			0
’ @entity114 , head of human resources at @entity12 , denied the men were sexist or treated her differently			2
she said miss @entity0 ’s emails were ‘ often very blunt ’ and carried a ‘ negative undertone ’			1
‘ her approach would often be directly critical and would frequently focus on the negative , ’ she said			2
‘ she also frequently overstepped the mark from professional interaction to personal attack			0
things would never have worked out unless @entity0 altered her style and approach , something for which i had seen little or no evidence of her being willing or capable of doing			2
' @entity0 seemed ultra-sensitive – always looking for issues and ultimately it was as though she was almost expecting there to be a problem with any change			0
controversial : the asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the @entity30 and @entity31 economist , dr @entity22 ( left ) which was featured in an exhibition ‘ i was sorry when , ultimately , my efforts to help @entity0 to make a success of her role failed , but looking back i ’m not sure there was any way we could have ultimately succeeded given the approach she took			1
’ miss @entity0 was accused by one boss of ‘ playing the woman card ’ when it suited her , the tribunal heard			1
@entity155 , head of investment trusts at @entity12 , said she was told by executive director @entity157 that ‘ when ms @entity0 did n’t like the outcome of a discussion or an outcome of a decision that she could then say this was because she was a woman rather than the fact that it was a business decision			1
‘ and so he said she will use and first play the woman card ...			0
( and ) would state at that point that it was because she was a woman rather than there was a difference of view as to how things could proceed			0
’ the tribunal continues .			1
