did they not worry the phone had been stolen ? @entity45 : one of the photos taken by @entity7 in @entity10 's @entity15 snap happy : @entity7 took lots of photos on her trip to @entity10 but had no idea she was running up a phone bill totaling £ 3,800 by uploading her pictures onto the social networking site @entity5 ' she was only using it for the normal teenage stuff , updating her friends with what she was up to and this and that			1
' it was an experience - we visited the @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity62 and the @entity63			0

big phone bill : @entity7 could n't wait to show off her holiday photos so she uploaded them on @entity5 which cost £ 3,800 thousands of pounds were taken out of @entity7 's father 's bank account to pay for the bill she ran up in @entity10 four days into the trip the teenager received a text from @entity30 warning she had gone over her internet data limit - and her bill had gone from its usual £ 50 to £ 320			1
the company barred the teen from sending any more text messages or making calls - but did not block her data roaming			1

' to be honest , i would n’t understand what a data cap was , and i do n’t think a lot of teenagers would , ' she said			0
' this is about the extortion of a 14 - year - old , and @entity30 is completely refusing to budge on the bill			1
' the rates that are charged are ridiculous and i just do n’t understand why another message was n’t sent after the one that said the bill had reached £ 320			0
why was n’t one sent at £ 500 or £ 1,000 ? ' her usual bill is around £ 50 - were n’t @entity30 concerned that her phone had been stolen ? anyone could press a button to say they wanted to continue using data			2
' we are just going to have to pay it			0
i ’m going to give her dad half of the money , but neither of us can afford it			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity30 said : ' all @entity30 customers have a number of protections in place - customers are even automatically opted - in to a roaming data cap , which limits their charges to £ 49 for a set amount of data			1
' customers receive warning texts to alert them of their data usage and we have an app that helps them monitor data usage , and opt - in to a data bundle if needed			0
' in this instance the customer received numerous text alerts which updated them on the roaming costs for the @entity163 , and also updated them on their data usage			0
' once they had reached the limit of their data bundle , the customer actively opted out of our roaming data cap so that they could continue to use data , effectively removing the in - built protection from large data roaming bills			1
