with one small tweet designed to have maximum effect , @entity0 showed in the early hours of this morning that continually he has the capacity to surprise			1
finally he has held true to what he said after winning @entity5 , that he would have his say on @entity8 independence , having spent the whole time in between making excuses for not doing so			1
some of us have wearied of listening to his various reasons : ' i ca n’t vote anyway ' / ' who cares what i think ' / ' it is n’t going to happen anyway ' have been among his methods of batting away inquiries on the subject			0
@entity0 poses with the union jack flag after winning gold and silver at the @entity25 @entity0 pictured with the @entity8 @entity27 flag ahead of the @entity29 exhibition event in 2006 every hint he has dropped – and there have been plenty – suggested that he was a no sympathiser , reluctant to break his cover for fear of alienating some of his fellow @entity8			1
and then he comes out on the actual day of the referendum to endorse the breaking up of the @entity38 based , he says , on the negativity of the @entity41 campaign of the past few days			1
his intervention happens to come on the day that @entity43 were drawn against @entity44 at home in the first round of the @entity48 next season			1
@entity0 ’s desire to see the end of @entity43 in its present form calls into question whether he will make himself available for the tie , even if the outcome of the referendum is , as most pollsters and bookmakers predict , a rejection of independence			1
among the many contradictions in all this is that @entity0 has rarely played better than when wrapping himself in the @entity62			2
he has only ever lost two singles rubbers in the @entity48 while he was brilliant in the @entity25 in being carried to the singles gold medal on a tide of patriotic support			2
@entity0 celebrates after winning a gold medal in the men 's singles at the @entity25 @entity0 signs a @entity8 flag during his homecoming parade in @entity71 in september 2012 @entity0 tweeted his support for the @entity74 campaign in the early hours of thursday morning it was the summer of 2012 when his relationship with the wider @entity38 public became distinctly warmer			1
first there was the raw emotion he showed after losing the @entity5 final to @entity81 , and then there was his considerable part in the incomparable surge of national pride that accompanied @entity86 2012			0
suddenly many people started to believe what they may have read or heard in the media that he is a far more personable fellow than his often surly demeanour on court or in set - piece interviews would suggest			0
he was a willing part of the public relations effort around him to nurture this effect after the overblown reaction to some silly joshing about the @entity99 football team all the way back in 2006			0
so it is hugely admirable from one angle to stand up for his principles and throw all that to the wind in a probably doomed attempt to help secure victory for @entity108 , with the resulting chill in public attitudes towards him			0
@entity0 ( 6th left ) celebrates with the rest of the @entity114 team after victory over @entity116 in 2013 @entity0 holds aloft the @entity5 gentlemen 's singles trophy in july 2013 as hundreds take photographs first minister @entity108 waves a @entity27 flag behind @entity123 after @entity0 's @entity5 victory @entity0 ( 2nd left ) joins @entity126 ( left ) , @entity123 ( 3rd right ) , @entity128 ( 2nd right ) and @entity130 during a cross-party reception at @entity132 to celebrate his @entity5 triumph in 2013 slightly confusing , too			2
@entity0 stated that his mind had been swayed in the last few days by the ‘ negative ’ campaigning of the no campaign , yet the one politician he has spoken of in glowing terms before is @entity139			2
on wednesday @entity139 gave what was described as the most passionate speech of his career in defence of the @entity62 , the centrepiece of the no side ’s late push			0
even political commentators who have spent years haranguing the former prime minister praised it as the most inspiring of his career , yet it seems to have swayed @entity43 ’s tennis number one in the other direction			0
his brother @entity153 also endorsed the @entity74 cause on thursday morning while mother @entity155 is of a similar persuasion , despite being @entity158 captain of the @entity38 team			1
@entity0 and brother @entity153 ( right ) speak at a @entity161 press conference ahead of the @entity25 @entity0 's brother @entity153 also tweeted his support for the @entity74 campaign on thursday morning but it is the far more celebrated younger brother who now faces the collateral damage from suddenly making his views known			1
his representatives are currently negotiating a new clothing deal worth around £ 3 million per year whose value is unlikely to be enhanced by alienating so many , especially at a time when he is struggling to recapture previous form on the court			0
the @entity161 ticket is a big selling point			0
you wonder how anti-independence @entity177 or their thousands of employees – facing being moved south or losing their jobs in the event of a @entity74 vote – will feel about their company spending millions on sponsoring an athlete who supports that outcome			0
@entity0 now finds himself a social media hero among the separatists , while in the infinitely more trivial world of @entity38 tennis there will be trepidation over whether , regardless of the referendum outcome , he will turn out for @entity161 again in the sport ’s premier team competition .			2

@entity0 tweeted his support for the @entity74 campaign in the early hours of thursday morning
@entity0 had long kept his thoughts to himself on the @entity8 independence referendum
it comes on the same day that @entity43 were drawn against @entity44 at home in the first round of the 2015 @entity48 @entity48
older brother @entity153 also endorsed the @entity74 cause on thursday
