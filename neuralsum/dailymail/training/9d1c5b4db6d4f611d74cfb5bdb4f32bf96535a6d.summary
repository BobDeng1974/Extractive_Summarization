in 12 months ’ time , maybe less , @entity0 will no longer be the manager of @entity1			1
how supporters remember him as a man matters greatly			1
‘ the most important thing for me and how i handle this situation is that i can look myself in the mirror , ’ said @entity0 yesterday			1
‘ i think of the great people that used to be here ; the @entity11 , the @entity12 , the @entity13 and the @entity14			1
and i ’ve got a job to do not to let them down			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 says he intends to run out his notice after announcing his decision to resign it was business as usual as @entity0 was all smiles as he lead a @entity1 ' training session at @entity22 @entity0 intends to speak with new chief executive @entity23 about the future of the club ‘ everyone will have a different opinion but the only thing that matters is that the @entity1 supporters felt that i did everything i did for them and for the club			1
that will be the only thing that matters to me			2
‘ how people remember means more to me as a person than anything else			2
that is the important thing for me			2
’ until a few months ago his legacy was secure			2
with 355 goals to his credit , @entity0 was and remains a @entity1 icon			1
a popular , gregarious character who showed a steely , resolute side to his personality during the bleak winter days of february 2012			2
yet the events of recent weeks have begun to alter perceptions			2
supporters – one or two directors as well - see the results and ask why , if he cares for @entity1 this much , @entity0 doggedly clings to office ? there is no joy in the criticism			1
it pains @entity1 supporters to question the man most still regard as @entity0			1
legally , many accept he is entitled to every penny he receives			2
morally , however , some openly ask now if @entity0 should n’t recognise the plight the club are in and ‘ do the decent thing			1
’ if he should n’t walk away and let someone else deliver value for money – and promotion - on the football pitch			1
@entity1 captain @entity65 in hysterics as he did n't seem to be too affected by his manager 's decision ‘ i ’ve been trying to do my best for the club and hope people realise that , ’ he countered			1
‘ that means more than anything to me			2
‘ people will have different opinions on my management skills and techniques , but i would hope that even the people who are justified in criticising me would appreciate that the mistakes i have made have been honest ones			2
‘ as a player , assistant manager and then manager i ’ve always had a fantastic relationship with the supporters			2
that ’s something i value as much as anything			2
there will be ones who thought i was hopeless as a centre forward or as a manager but the most important thing is that they know that all i ’ve tried to do is do my best for them and for the club			2
’ @entity93 is always the healer with these things			2
the closest parallel to @entity0 is @entity96 , the greatest living ranger who endured a dismal spell as manager before resigning in 1983			1
yet in the years since they have built a statue to his memory , even if @entity96 – like @entity0 - has been sickened by the events of the last three years			1
inevitably , legends are remembered for what they did on the pitch			2
in time , the travails of @entity0 over the last two years will be forgotten and his relationship with supporters repaired			1
distancing himself from the mayhem of recent times was essential for that to happen			2
‘ i have to be truthful and say that once i made the decision there was a sense of relief there , ’ he said			0
‘ i think probably just the last three years or so probably has certainly been taxing and difficult at times			0
so there is probably relief that i will definitely be able to spend time with my family and things like that			0
do things that i want to do myself			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) shares a joke with former player @entity127 during the training session at @entity22 nevertheless , the magnitude of the decision can hardly be overestimated			1
he spoke with trusted allies , @entity132 amongst them , before making it			0
the departure of long - term , low - earning club employees was also a factor in the tendering of his resignation			1
‘ it was one of the hardest decisions of my life , without doubt			0
but it is the right decision , ’ he said			0
when it ’s over , he wo n’t turn his back on football			0
few doubt a long - running dispute with the @entity149 will be put to one side because he is a television natural			1
another crack at management is not out of the question , but there is a caveat			0
‘ not in @entity157 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t know where			0
i would hate to say something and then it comes back to haunt me			0
but i do n’t think i could manage or coach any other team in @entity157			0
‘ i love the game			0
whether it is coaching somewhere else , or managing somewhere else or being involved in some other capacity , i could n’t see myself not being involved in football			0
’ his curriculum vitae features successive promotions from @entity157 ’s lower leagues			0
at any other club , sitting second in the promotion race would be grounds for celebration rather than dismissal or resignation , but @entity0 knows better than most how unique the demands of @entity1 can be			1
‘ i probably think top of the @entity177 would be “ can handle management under stressful situations , ” ’ he grinned			0
‘ that would be top of the list			0
that would be up there in bold print			0
that would be all i could say really			0
‘ as i have said before , i think it has been very difficult			0
everybody will have their own opinions , which everyone is entitled to , but it is not just as clear cut as that because there has been a lot of differing and varying factors that have affected my management and would affect anybody else ’s management			0
’ some of the opinions expressed have come from unexpected quarters			0
@entity1 messageboards buzzed this week with claims that the relationship between @entity0 and his old strike partner @entity205 had cooled after the @entity206 allegedly began briefing against him behind his back			1
@entity205 denies the allegations furiously , but has been unable – so far – to explain himself personally			0
@entity209 ( centre ) looks to close down the ball during the team 's training session on friday ‘ i ’ve not had a chance to speak to @entity205 , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but i will			1
it ’s another thing but i ’ve got to tell you lads i ’m not annoyed and i ’m not bothered			0
@entity205 and i have been through a lot together and we ’ll sit down and have a chat			0
‘ we ’re both big boys and , as i say , we ’ve been through an awful lot together			0
’ @entity205 – and @entity96 – were able to put their status as @entity1 favourites to use when they stopped playing			1
@entity0 owns a million shares , but is unable to say how his own relationship with the club will develop when the ill feeling of recent weeks abates and he is gone			1
‘ i have n’t thought about that			0
but i would imagine i will be taking a seat in the stand with my sons and watching the games			0
’ the plan is to be watching a @entity1 team back in the @entity237			1
whether that happens on his watch as manager depends to a huge extent on how the players respond to his resignation in the coming weeks			1
the early signs in @entity245 were unpromising			0
‘ i can understand people thinking standards might drop among players when they know a manager is leaving , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but i can assure the supporters we wo n’t allow that to happen			0
‘ the standards did drop for the first time last friday night			1
there is absolutely no excuse for the level of performance we put in last friday			1
so we need to reassure people that standards at our club will be as high as possible			0
’ at @entity1 , an ongoing football circus , it ’s been some time since anyone was able to say that .			1

news of @entity0 's resignation from @entity1 came last friday night
