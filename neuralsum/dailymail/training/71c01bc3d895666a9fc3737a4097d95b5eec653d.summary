from the top of the world to the exit door in seven short months , it has been an unstoppable slide for @entity4 as he was caught up in @entity6 ’s new reality			1
as @entity4 he adjusts to new targets as a @entity9 player he may stop to wonder what has happened since his two goals in the @entity12 semi-final and @entity14 ’s glorious month in @entity15			1
he returned in confident mood and scored in @entity6 ’s opening game at @entity18 what remains one of the best goals of this season , but things can change quickly in football and he has made way for @entity25			1
@entity12 winner @entity4 struggled to impress @entity26 at @entity27 schurrle trains in the snow following his big money move to @entity9 @entity4 was not @entity26 ’s selection , which is never a good starting point for a relationship between player and manager , although it does not mean it is doomed to fail			1
he was identified by @entity37 ’s scouting network before @entity26 returned to @entity27			1
@entity6 had tried to sign him when @entity38 was in charge , soon after winning the @entity40 , and stayed on his trail , but @entity26 gave the transfer his blessing and the @entity45 striker , fast , versatile , direct and industrious seemed a good fit for his tactical style			1
when he first arrived in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity4 ’s coach and mentor through the youth ranks to the first team at @entity54 , was certain he would excel in the high - pressure environment of the @entity56			1
@entity6 unveil new winger @entity25 as a replacement for @entity4 who moved to @entity9 “ he is an excellent team player who will dedicate his speed and skills to defending and able to decide matches with his offensive abilities , ” said @entity49			1
“ you can be fast but he also has quick anticipation			0
he is half a second quicker in deciding and sees the situation before defending			0
” there were memorable contributions : a hat - trick at @entity70 , the first in a second - leg comeback against @entity73 and that delightful goal at @entity75 on the opening day			0
it was the clinical finish the approach play deserved			0
he also scored on his final appearance , as a sub in the 5 - 0 win at @entity83			0
by then his fate had been sealed			0
perhaps his biggest obstacle was the fact he performed best from the left wing , a role with belongs to @entity89			0
@entity4 was always going to struggle to oust the impressive @entity91 winger @entity89 at @entity6 he was a useful substitute to have but that did not appeal			1
having started the season in the team , opportunities were drying up			0
at @entity97 , @entity96 spoke of motivational problems he felt after the @entity12 triumph			2
at @entity6 , they pointed to a virus which knocked @entity4 ’s fitness in october			1
unlike @entity97 ’s three world champions , he had reported back for pre-season after a truncated break and was flying at the start of the season			0
@entity4 rejects the idea that this illness was anything other than a brief interruption			2
there have been no questions about his motivation			0
@entity26 simply seemed to have lost faith , hauling him off at half - time following a poor 45 minutes in @entity117 in at the start of november			2
@entity6 new boy @entity120 shields the ball from @entity123 's @entity122 while playing for @entity124 the manager blamed the virus for a poor display , but the @entity45 has only started one @entity56 game since , at @entity129 during the fixture congestion around @entity131			1
he has started only five times in the @entity56 this season and @entity4 is not the type to sit happily on the bench			2
he was not homesick – he loved @entity48 – and there was no big bust - up			0
but , at 24 , he wanted to play every week			0
he met with his father @entity138 and agent @entity139 in november and decided to stick it out until the end of the season and then look for a transfer if nothing had changed			0
a month later , the trio met again			0
the situation seemed to have worsened and they agreed to accept a january move if the right one became available			2
@entity26 has made a habit of selling players ( like @entity152 ) for big money in order to shape his @entity6 squad they were aware of interest from @entity14 and ambitious @entity9 is a challenge which appeals to @entity4			1
he will not play tonight at @entity159 but he will be in contention at home against @entity162 on saturday			0
was the situation contrived by @entity26 ? was he deliberately unsettled ? it is conceivable			2
but this is the way football operates			0
@entity26 wanted @entity120 and would have been aware of a buy - out clause in his @entity124 contract which @entity6 could meet if they balanced the @entity170 figures by selling a player			1
@entity4 , a world champion in his mid-twenties on the fringe of the team , fitted the bill			2
@entity176 was another big money player that was allowed to leave @entity27 for a sizable fee @entity6 wanted £ 30m , @entity9 paid £ 24m with add - ons and @entity4 joined @entity176 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 and players to leave @entity27 in their prime to generate big money to reshape the team			1
privately , @entity26 had reservations about all of them , either in terms of their character or their tactical suitability within the style he wants to play , which supports the idea for the time being that the manager ’s opinion is prevailing in regard to who comes and goes at first - team level			2
this was not always the case in the years between his first spell and the club and his return in 2013			0
as a footnote to the deadline - day departures from @entity6 , it is worth mention that the three players – @entity4 , @entity211 and @entity212 - who infuriated @entity26 by joining @entity97 players for their @entity131 night out , 14 months ago , are no longer at the club			1
@entity212 infuriated @entity26 14 months ago and joined @entity129 on deadline day			1

@entity4 won the @entity12 with @entity14 just seven months ago
yet @entity4 was only ever a bit part player under @entity26
the @entity221 boss let the *midfielder* seal a £ *24million* to @entity9
@entity124 ace @entity25 replaces the @entity45 following his move
