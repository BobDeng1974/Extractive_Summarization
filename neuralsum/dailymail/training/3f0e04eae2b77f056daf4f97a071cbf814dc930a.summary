by @entity0 it could mean the end of the washing machine - and a lot less hassle			2
a @entity7 student has revealed his concept for a ' washing ball '			2
it can be placed directly into a laundry basket , and clean clothes without ever having to remove them			1
the @entity15 concept is a metallic sphere with a small amount of water			1
it creates a cloud of fine particles of steam electrostatically charged , which comes out through pores of the metal surface , vibrations and pulses then scrub and shake farbic , removing dirt			1
the @entity15 concept is a metallic sphere with a small amount of water in it			1
it creates a cloud of fine particles of steam electrostatically charged , which comes out through pores of the metal surface			2
it then rotates and moves between clothes through vibrations and pulses designed to scrub and shake tissues , loosening dirt			1
the metallic surface of the sphere acts as a magnet : electrostatically charged , it attracts dirt particles impregnated with steam and sucks these towards the core of the sphere			1
finally , @entity15 dries with hot air the residual damp in the tissues			1
the idea has already been selected as a finalist in the prestigious @entity53 contest			0
@entity15 is an electrostatic spherical washing machine			1
' the idea is not to put the clothes into a washing machine , but rather , the washing machine between the dirty clothes , ' says @entity60 of @entity61 , who developed the design			2
he claims consumers will be won over by its ease of use , but also the environmental advantages			0
' users are increasingly aware of the care of the planet			0
' @entity15 renews the fabric care experience , in a simple , elegant and sustainable way , he said			1

' these are the reasons why @entity15 will be part of the lives of the users of the future and of the transformation of the homes , in healthy homes			1
' the luna design turns the laundry basket into a washing machine - all owners have to do is drop the metallic ball in to get their clothes cleaned the competition is conducted in stages , allowing the applicants to develop their concept throughout the process			1
