by @entity0 author @entity1 admitted that she suffered many of the same misfortunes as her creation @entity5 she created one of one of the most calamity - hit heroines of contemporary fiction			1
now @entity1 has revealed that she is more like @entity5 than she would care to admit , and is constantly getting herself into embarrassing scrapes			1
whether it ’s melting her kettle , sending round - robin emails by mistake or accidentally stealing petrol , the author admitted her day - to - day life is not too dissimilar to that of her scatter - brained heroine			1
speaking at the @entity20 in @entity21 yesterday , @entity22 , 56 , said ‘ things seem to happen ’ to her despite being a world - famous novelist			1
she said : ‘ i have always denied it but think actually maybe there are some things in common			1
’ she recounted one incident in which she received a call from her agent saying that a policeman had called and asked if she was the owner of a @entity35			2
‘ it turns out that i had driven away from a petrol station without paying for the petrol , ’ she said			1
‘ there was some criminal charge going on			2
’ in another , she accidentally left a kettle on a hob and came back to find it melting and giving off ‘ acrid smoke ’			1
she said although she was ‘ very disorganised ’ , she kept a file of the messes she had got herself into which could provide inspiration for her novels			2
she said : ‘ it started when i had my daughter , and i was having her via c - section			2
so i decided to do a birth announcement , saying what she was going to be called , when she was going to be born and so on			2
‘ so i prepared this email to send to everyone before i went into hospital			2
but then i accidentally pressed “ send all ”			1
‘ so then i had to then say , “ sorry , i have n’t actually had the baby			2
” so then when i did have the baby i thought , “ i ca n’t send another one			2
” it all got into a terrible mess			0
’ ms @entity1 has written three novels featuring @entity5 who was played by @entity67 actress @entity66 , pictured she also admitted that , like her heroine @entity68 , who is always chopping and changing outfits , she worried what to wear for to speak for the event			1
‘ i worried a lot about whether it was ok to wear these boots , ’ she said			0
‘ i was infected with the concept of effortless festival chic			0
this morning i was very confused about what to wear			0
’ @entity22 , whose novel @entity77 and the sequel @entity5 : @entity80 were published in the 1990s , said she hoped the stories had helped single women feel more comfortable about themselves			1
the books , which were both made into films starring @entity66 and @entity85 , tell the story of a single girl in her 30s and her quest for happiness in love , life and work			1
she hit out at the idea that when a woman comes ‘ of a certain age ’ they were expected to ‘ fade away and say , “ never mind me ”			0
’ ‘ the truth is , that we do not actually really change , ’ she said			0
‘ that mentalness and that sense of hope and joy and the ability to be childish and be silly and keep exploring life and keep having adventures and keep having sex and keep seeing what ’s round the corner is part of being a person , a woman			1
’ she added : ‘ life is for living			1
we live longer , and especially women , we should carry on and give ourselves a new identity			0
especially thirty - something women , do n’t think of themselves as tragic barren spinsters now			0
’ she also lamented the fact that societal expectations were so high for women to be perfect in every aspect of their lives			0
she said : ‘ the bar now is so high in terms of what we ’re supposed to be like			0
in terms of what we ’re supposed to look like , what we ’re supposed to wear , what we ’re supposed to be like as parents , and what we are supposed to have achieved professionally			0
’ ‘ i think it ’s huge and it ’s really sad			0
if @entity68 has done anything to change that , and make people think it ’s alright to muck up , it ’s alright not to be perfect , it ’s alright to be fat , it ’s alright to sometimes say the wrong thing , as long as you ’re kind and you can laugh along with your friends			0
’ she said that the problem was so ingrained that it was filtering down to children			0
she added : ‘ i ’ve yet to meet a woman who does not obsess about her weight			0
there might be some , but i think we ’ve looked at too many airbrushed pictures			0
‘ with the children aged seven saying “ i ’m fat , ” , it ’s really difficult			0
’ @entity22 , from @entity153 , started her career as a newspaper journalist and @entity77 began its life as an anonymous column in @entity158 in 1995			1
her latest novel , @entity5 : @entity160 , tells the story of @entity68 as an older woman who is widowed and decides to get on the dating scene again			1
@entity22 said she thought most people were meeting online now rather than in person , adding : ‘ it ’s no longer a sign of desperation			1
