two @entity1 models suffered an awkward fashion mishap last night when they turned up to @entity5 's @entity4 gala wearing the same dress			2
@entity8 , 24 , and @entity9 , 26 , both looked stunning - albeit unoriginal - as they arrived at @entity10 in their matching teal cut - out @entity12 gowns , which retail for $ 2,395 , and even accessorized them with similar black clutches			1
the @entity17 - based label , launched in 2008 by designers @entity19 and @entity20 , is clearly proving popular			1
on the previous night over in @entity24 , @entity25 , models @entity21 and @entity23 sported an identical frock by the same designer - this time a $ 1,495 orange number - at the @entity29 bash			1
oops ! @entity8 , 24 , ( left ) and @entity9 , 26 , ( right ) both looked stunning - albeit unoriginal - as they arrived at @entity10 in their matching @entity12 gowns , which retail for $ 2,395 both ms @entity8 and ms @entity9 stand at 5ft 11in , are represented by @entity36 and are based in @entity17			1
@entity37 - born ms @entity8 , whose ample bosom better filled out her dress , wore her hair tied back and teamed her smoky eyes with red nail varnish ; while @entity44 - born ms @entity9 wore her blonde hair loose and opted for pale make - up and nails			0
both models have worked for @entity1 in the past			0
ms @entity9 has appeared in several of the lingerie giant 's ads and walked in its 2006 fashion show			0
face - off : @entity37 - born ms @entity8 wore her hair tied back and rocked smoky eyes ( left ) while @entity44 - born ms @entity9 wore her blonde hair loose and opted for pared - down make - up ( right ) double trouble : @entity21 ( right ) turned up at the @entity29 bash on wednesday night in the same $ 1,495 orange @entity12 dress as @entity23 ( left ) ms @entity8 has also shot a number of campaigns for @entity1 , and walked the 2010 , 2011 and 2013 shows			1
she was scheduled to appear in the 2012 show too but sprained her ankle during rehearsals and had to pull out			0
had the girls been lent their @entity12 gowns directly from the designers , whose label is favored by the likes of @entity72 and @entity73 , they likely would have been warned they would be matching			0
it is possible , therefore , that they hired the dress from @entity77 , where it is currently available costing $ 300 for a four - day rental			1
lingerie ladies : ms @entity8 has appeared numerous times in the annual @entity82 , pictured ( left ) in december 2014 , while ms @entity9 walked the 2006 show ( right ) @entity84 indeed ! the slinky floor - length @entity12 frock was also worn by model and cookbook author @entity88 , 44 , in @entity17 last october ( pictured ) the slinky floor - length frock was also worn by model and cookbook author @entity88 , 44 , in @entity17 last october			2
as for model and @entity21 star ms @entity21 , 23 , inadvertently matching her dress with ms @entity23 , yet another @entity96 's @entity95 model , this duo embraced their fashion faux pas with open arms			2
the brunettes spent most of the night posing side - by - side , with ms @entity21 joking on @entity102 : ' @entity103 were # twinning ! decided to rock it together and be each other 's dates ! ( sic ) '			0

both models sported a $ 2,395 teal cut - out dress from the *increasingly* popular @entity17 - based label
the previous night , @entity21 and @entity23 wore an identical orange frock , also by @entity19 et @entity12 , at the @entity29 bash
the teal gown is currently available on @entity77 costing $ 300 for a four - day loan
