a simple chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce the damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack survival rates after a heart attack or stroke could be significantly boosted after a breakthrough by @entity12 scientists			1
a simple chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce the damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack			1
a team led by doctors and biologists at @entity20 think that if the substance is injected following an attack , it could reduce long - term injury to vital organs			1
the breakthrough , published in the journal nature tonight , came about after the team established the mechanism by which damage is done to organs after a heart attack or stroke			1
while much of the harm is suffered during the attack itself , injury is also done when blood floods back into the organs afterwards			2
when surgeons clear the clot that caused the attack - a process vital for survival - blood and oxygen rushes back into the heart or brain , in a process called reperfusion			1
doctors have long been frustrated by the fact that by saving the patient ’s life , they do further damage to the body			0
but until now that process had been a mystery			0
the new study , carried out on computer models and confirmed in mice , revealed that the damage is done by a chemical called succinate which occurs naturally in the body			0
the researchers , from @entity20 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , found that succinate builds up to abnormally high levels in tissue starved of oxygen during an attack			1
when the blood flow returns , the succinate interacts with oxygen , combing to release destructive new molecules which kill off cells in the heart or other organs			0
the injury means that in months and years after a heart attack , there is an increased risk of heart failure or other problems			2
crucially , the researchers discovered they could reduce organ damage in mice by injecting simple chemicals called malonate esters			0
injected during the treatment of a stroke or heart attack , the chemical could stop the build - up of succinate and the resulting release of destructive molecules			2
malonate esters are cheap , readily available and are found naturally in fruits such as strawberries , apples and grapes , although not in high enough volumes to be beneficial by eating alone			2
dr @entity101 of @entity20 said : ‘ this research explains how organ damage occurs during the first few minutes of restoring blood supply after a heart attack or stroke and , importantly , how to stop this damage			1
a team led by doctors and biologists at @entity20 think that if the substance is injected following an attack , it could reduce long - term injury to vital organs ‘ we have used simple chemicals found in everyday fruits like apples and grapes that had never been suspected as being therapeutically useful before			1
amazingly , these chemicals worked very well			0
’ professor @entity120 , medical director at the @entity121 , which funded the study , said : ‘ we have no way of knowing how much damage is caused during a heart attack and how much during reperfusion			2
' but it is a reasonable assumption to say that if we could reduce reperfusion damage we could reduce the risk of later heart failure			0
‘ there are reasons to be optimistic that we could see this move quickly towards a treatment now that the basic findings have been made			0
‘ drugs companies are certainly very interested and we could see clinical trials within a few years			0
