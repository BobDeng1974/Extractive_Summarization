the tv presenter has unveiled a range of bedding for @entity6 , so @entity7 caught up with her for some serious pillow talk			1
' i was asked if i would be interested in doing a homeware range and immediately said yes because something that i love doing in my own life is making my home look nice , ' she explained			1
in bed with @entity3 : miss @entity3 has unveiled a range of vintage inspired bedding for @entity6 ' people always say " what do you do in your home life ? " and i do n't really have anything , all i do is work and be a mum but if there was one hobby i have , it 's decorating my home			1
' @entity3 , who juggles motherhood , tv presenting , fashion designing for very and modelling duties , has been very hands on with her @entity6 range			1
the 32 - year - old spent two years putting together mood boards from her inspirations and she could n't be happier with the final result			1
' from goodness knows what age , i 've always bought home magazines , taken out cuttings and kept scrap books			2
so it 's quite natural to do this and i wanted to make bedrooms that i 'd want to sleep in , ' she explained			2
hobby : the 32 - year - old , who has been working on her designs for two years , says that she 's always had a passion for decorating while there 's plenty of vintage - inspired lace , feminine prints and eye - catching pearl fringes , @entity3 has ensured that her range appeals to men too			1
' i have a husband that has a pillow phobia , he hates that i put cushions and pillows everywhere			2
so i have added nautical and masculine touches to my range			1
i like things to be really beautiful but really practical to use			2
' so what 's @entity3 's own boudoir like ? ' my bed is my favourite place to be in the whole world			2
i have candles everywhere and laundry sprays so when i get into bed it smells nice , ' she said			0
low maintenance : @entity3 , whose face greets the nation every day on @entity78 , explains that she swears by make - up wipes much to the disappointment of her male fans , @entity3 - who regularly tops @entity81 polls - takes a ' comfort first ' approach when it comes to bedroom attire			1
' what do i sleep in ? well , i 've got a onesie , it 's definitely onesie weather , ' she said			1
but you wo n't see her pulling on a ' twosie ' - a the two person onesie - with her husband @entity91 anytime soon			1
' i 'm not sure about twosies , i like my onesie for myself , there 's no room for anyone else in it , ' she laughed			2
@entity3 also shared her pre-bedtime beauty regime with us - and you 'll be surprised to know that , despite her glossy and polished looks , she 's a low - maintenance girl			1
' @entity104 wipes are my saviour			0
i used to be useless at taking my make - up off at night , i 'd wake up with a print of my face on the pillow			2
' you can get away with that when you 're younger but i 'm at the point where i think " @entity3 , it 's time to grow up "			0
' @entity116 do some great wipes , they 're really nice and organic			0
i tend to use lots of @entity116 stuff and love her day moisturiser , ' she said			0
so how does she keep her skin looking so flawless despite early morning stints on this morning ? ( earlier in the day she had mediated between @entity122 and @entity123 , who argued over parenting in a debate that carried on after the cameras stopped rolling , revealed @entity3 )			0
' i am one of life 's big sleepers , i could sleep anywhere , any time			0
welcome to @entity3 's boudoir : ranging in price from £ 15 - £ 100 , @entity3 's range is feminine and @entity133 vintage inspired fresh : @entity3 wanted her designs to be pretty yet practical and spent two years pulling together inspiration ' i go to bed early unless i 'm out			1
i am a sneak into bed at 9pm gal. i 'd go earlier , but it 's wrong to miss out			0
' most mornings i wake up and go " it 's ok , you 'll be getting into bed again tonight "			0
' left to my own devices i would just sleep and sleep , that 's why having kids was such a surprise			0
i 'm like " what do you mean they wake up in the night ? do i really have to get up now ? ! " , ' she laughed			0
aside from juggling young children , early mornings and new projects ( she has also recently released a children 's book with her sister ) , @entity3 could n't be happier right now			0
' i 'm in a really good place at the moment with work and life			0
i 've had afternoons off which is unheard of and i can spend time with my daughter when she is n't at nursery , which is really nice , ' she said			0
it seems like life is a sweet dream for tv 's favourite face			0
