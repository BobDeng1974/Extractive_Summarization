by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:39 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 04:53 est , 22 july 2013 good neighbours ? @entity3 and her husband @entity4 reacted angrily to claims they kept neighbours up with a house party her good girl image was somewhat diminished after she wore a very revealing black dress on the final of @entity12 last month , prompting 139 complaints to the @entity14			1
so an ugly neighbourly dispute is the last thing that tv presenter @entity3 will have wanted – not least because she has been accused of ‘ keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour ’			2
the accusation was made in an anonymous letter delivered to the £ 3million home she shares with her tv executive husband @entity4 and their two young children			1
mr @entity4 , 37 , reacted angrily to the letter by emailing 50 neighbours , many of whom the couple have never met , seeking help in tracking down the letter - writer			1
he denies creating any such noise , saying he and @entity34 were watching @entity35 – a @entity37 drama set in the world of country music – and that they want ‘ an explanation ’ from their critic			1
and to assist their hunt , mr @entity4 attached two images of the woman who delivered the letter , obtained from the cctv cameras bristling from his luxury home			1
now one furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy , saying that the couple have unleashed ‘ utter building chaos ’ on the area over the last year			1
@entity57 , 55 , said : ‘ we have been shocked by this vicious intrusive email , in which they make themselves out to be good neighbours , when we have had enormous trucks blocking the pavement six days a week			2
’ the row has disrupted the usual calm in the well - heeled area of south - west @entity68 , where @entity34 and her husband bought their house 18 months ago			2
since then they have lavished hundreds of thousands more on the house , which already boasts an impressive garden and balconies overlooking the @entity76			0
they have made a series of planning applications , including bids to build a large extension , a garage complete with ‘ staff accommodation ’ , and a large swimming pool			2
it seems the neighbours have tolerated the work – but somebody must have snapped on saturday morning , when the letter was delivered			1
the streets around ms @entity3 's home : one furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy , saying that the couple have unleashed ' utter building chaos ' on the area over the past year in the afternoon , mr @entity4 sent out his email , headed , ‘ your help – our neighbourhood ’			1
it read : ‘ @entity102 , this morning this lady left a letter on my doorstep			0
the letter was extremely rude and overly aggressive ( i ’ll save you from the gory details )			0
mystery critic : @entity110 footage of the mystery woman who delivered the letter to ms @entity3 's £ 3million home sent out by her husband ‘ it wrongly accused us of “ keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour ”			1
‘ in fact the whole house was in bed by 10.30pm – after two episodes of @entity35 ( please do n’t judge me on this ! )			2
‘ the letter had no name or house number so i ’d very much like to explain this to the lady on the picture and i ’d like an explanation from her on the letter ’s contents			0
‘ her photo , from our @entity110 footage is attached			2
any help clearing this up would be hugely appreciated			0
‘ i ’d like to think that we live in a neighbourhood where we can freely knock on our neighbours doors and have a civilised chat about any concerns / worries / issues			0
’ mr @entity57 , who works in the @entity145 , added : ‘ they think that they are decent neighbours , but at no point have they apologised for the disruption			0
' the trucks and other stuff associated with their building works regularly block the pavement , and those who are elderly , disabled or pushing a pram have to take their life into their hands and walk in the road			0
‘ just when we thought it was nearly finished , they have got planning permission to build a big pool in their garden			0
’ mr @entity4 and @entity34 , who also presents @entity167 ’s @entity166 , refused to discuss either their email , or the complaints about the work on their home			0
the woman in the @entity110 image could not be tracked down for comment last night			1
