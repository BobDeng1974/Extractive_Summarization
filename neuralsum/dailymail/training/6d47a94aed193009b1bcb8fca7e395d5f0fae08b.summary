as ' @entity3 ' banner appears amid a darkened , stormy sky , a @entity1 voice sounds , ' football , bloody hell			0
what the hell was that all about ? '			0
a woman then has her say , ' i was ashamed of them '			0
the on - screen text is equally damning , ' following a season of discontent ' it reads			0
the banner , wearing the face of @entity16 , crumples to the backdrop of thunder and lightening			1
' trust me , we 'll be back , ' a foreign voice adds as the @entity23 players emerge from the clouds with the message ' a new storm is breaking '			0
@entity21 then has his say , ' keep supporting us and the good times will come back soon '			2
while the statues of sir @entity48 and sir @entity49 stand guard , @entity21 and new boss @entity46 are cast in the troubled sky , ' @entity52 '			1
the neon , red lettering of ' @entity23 ' breaks through the gloom , ' start to rebuild a dynasty '			0
the message is clear : @entity16 brought down the empire , @entity20 and @entity21 will rebuild it			1
@entity25 makes no attempt to mask its appraisal of @entity16 ' efforts last season , the use of the word ' ashamed ' proving particularly barbed			1
statuesque : the promo also features the looming former managers sir @entity49 and sir @entity48 the new regime : the clouds reveal new boss @entity46 and club legend @entity21 having succeeded @entity49 – whose decision it was to appoint his compatriot – the @entity73 led the champions to a sorry seventh in the @entity76 , missing out on @entity78 football for the first time since 1995			1
each passing week saw the collection of another unwanted record ; it was @entity23 's worst season since the birth of the @entity76 in 1992			0
@entity16 paid with his job before the end of the campaign and @entity86 boss @entity20 was appointed			2
axed : former @entity23 boss @entity16 is disparaged in the advert on the club 's channel @entity25 are evidently keen to get behind the new regime and the trailer is a bold production given its setting on an in - house station			1
but in an age where we criticise clubs for the propaganda - like offerings from their official websites and tv channels , @entity25 should at least be applauded for refusing to ignore their disastrous last campaign			2
we 're not too sure @entity16 will agree with that sentiment , however .			2

@entity25 advert shows a crumpled @entity16 ' @entity107 ' banner
*voiceover* slams regime - ' i was ashamed of them '
paints @entity46 and @entity21 as ' master and apprentice '
