it is just something i did in my downtime			2
it may surprise people to know that i am not an mp 24/7			1
i wrote the first book in recess last year and am half - way through the second			1
i have had time to do it since my daughters have flown the nest , nobody is dependent on me			2
’ she dismissed critics who queried how she had the time to pen novels between her parliamentary and constituency duties			2
‘ lots of male mps have written books , including @entity60			2
why does no one ever ask how they manage it ? ’ high profile : miss @entity3 became one of the best known politicians in the country after taking part in @entity69 born in in 1957 , one of three daughters , @entity3 grew up in @entity72 , attending @entity73 before training as a nurse			1
writing for the @entity17 in 2010 , she revealed her childhood memories which will form the basis of her novels : ' i spent 25 years in a council house , and whenever i think of my childhood in @entity72 the memories are set in relief against the backdrop of my family home			2
i think of thursday nights , when the week ’s pay had run out and how the mothers in my street used to group together and cook a pan of scouse and feed the streets kids , in one kitchen			2
the pan was big , having at some time , i am sure , fallen off the back of a ship moored in @entity72 docks			2
we were the originators of the @entity101			0
we lived and breathed it			0
i may have lived on a council estate but i also lived in a neighbourly community			0
it came as a shock , when i reached my teens , to discover that all the neighbours i had referred to as auntie and uncle were not in fact related to me			0
our council house was our home and it meant as much to us as @entity114 does to the @entity115			0
an @entity117 ’s home is his castle but castles come in all shapes and sizes			0
@entity122 of @entity123 said the novel , called @entity125 , is one of three ‘ set in 1950s @entity72 about @entity128 families struggling against poverty , hardship and abuse ’ , and will be published in april			1
editor @entity132 said she ' had to have ' the book on her list of new releases : ‘ i absolutely adored this novel from first word to last			0
@entity3 is one of the most naturally gifted storytellers i have ever come across , with a magical ability to create characters you believe in and a heart - stopping way with words			1
mrs @entity3 has often spoken of her life growing up in @entity72 in the 1950s and 1960s , living in a council house which formed the backdrop of her childhood memories			1

she said at the time : ' if that is where sixteen million people are , it 's where politicians need to be too			1
' instead she was pictured performing jokes with @entity166 from @entity167 and eating camel toe and ostrich anus in a challenge against @entity172 star @entity171			0
it took until may until @entity4 bosses were satisfied that she would fall into line , and she had the whip restored in time for the @entity177			0
a former nurse , she worked in business and as an adviser to @entity4 mp @entity181 before being elected to @entity35 in 2005			1
in recent years she has been a constant critic of the prime minister and chancellor			0
last year she declared : ' the problem is that policy is being run by two public schoolboys who do n't know what it 's like to go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because they ca n't afford it for their children 's lunchboxes			1
' what 's worse , they do n't care , either ' a month later she stepped up the attack , claiming : ‘ not only are @entity27 and @entity28 two posh boys who do n't know the price of milk , but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse , no contrition , and no passion to want to understand the lives of others - and that is their real crime			1
' however , amid claims she could defect to the @entity211 @entity210 , the @entity4 leadership agreed to let her return to fold as long as she agreed to toe the line			0
in june she announced she would stop claiming parliamentary expenses and insisted all mps should be paid one flat - rate fee			1
in a posting on her website , she said her decision would mean she would effectively be working for her constituents for free			0
' i have long said that under the present system , before long , @entity221 will be a place of millionaires or paupers			0
i loathe the expenses system and believe it should be scrapped and @entity214 paid one flat - rate fee , ' she said			1
' whilst i draw personal expenses , i can not argue for reform of the system or put forward the case to scrap expenses			0
not drawing expenses puts me in a stronger position to be able to do this			0
