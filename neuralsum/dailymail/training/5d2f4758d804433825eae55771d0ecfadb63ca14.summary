@entity0 is looking slimmer and happier than ever before she looked like a new woman			1
slimmer than ever and bursting with an exuberance they have n’t seen for years			1
@entity5 of @entity6 has lost almost four stone			1
that much was clear to party - goers at @entity11 who helped her celebrate a double birthday : the 21st anniversary of her charity @entity15 and @entity0 reaching the age of 55			1
she was her old self			1
when the @entity20 offered her favourite home to her former daughter - in - law for the dinner it was more than just a symbolic gesture			1
she knew how happy this would make prince @entity27 , under whose royal roof the @entity5 continues to live 18 years after they divorced			1
and what an occasion it was ( even if a little brash ) as dinner was served in the @entity34 to 200 , including @entity35 and prince @entity36 ’s on - off girlfriend @entity37			1
other guests included rich business friends such as property developer @entity41 and mobile phone tycoon @entity42			1
naturally , @entity44 and @entity45 were there with their boyfriends			1
there was opera from @entity50 , the runner - up in @entity53 ’s @entity52 , and several other musical acts including singer - songwriter @entity55 and the all - girl @entity57 classical quartet @entity59			1
@entity0 loved it all , sitting in the castle immediately beneath a bust of @entity20 @entity63			1
she was next to millionaire businessman sir @entity65 and on the same table as her former husband , who was beside the broadcaster sir @entity69 ’s widow @entity68			1
‘ @entity72 looked so at home , ’ says one of the guests			1
‘ she had lots of diamonds flashing around her throat and looked really fantastic , better than i ’ve seen her for years			1
‘ her face was a picture , a huge smile , as everyone sang happy birthday			1
she was so happy you could almost think the @entity20 had given her back her @entity86			1
’ but there was something else that people noticed about @entity0			1
one guest called it a ‘ calmness ’ that was quite new			1
perhaps this is not so surprising			2
for the fact is that something really is up — it ’s the rebranding of @entity0			2
and where better to signal it to the world than at @entity11 ? the resurrection of @entity0 is a crucial element in secret talks she has been having in the @entity104 to endorse healthy food			1
it ’s a brave move			2
who would have thought she could be galvanised to risk launching a new business after what happened the last time she tried ? seven years ago , she set about turning herself into a household brand name , endorsing products from jewellery and scented candles to fashion and food			2
her @entity104 company , @entity118 , also encompassed earnings from her children ’s books , after - dinner speaking and tv appearances			2
but with lavish offices overlooking @entity6 ’s @entity125 and a large staff , its spiralling costs — plus @entity0 ’s extravagant spending — were soon outstripping her earnings and plunging the operation into debt well beyond £ 3 million			1
it was at that time , four years ago , that a desperate @entity0 offered ‘ access ’ to prince @entity27 for £ 500,000 to an ‘ @entity134 business tycoon ’ , who turned out to be an undercover journalist at the now defunct @entity137			2
she is pictured sporting a fuller figure in 2010 ( left ) and 2009 ( right ) this was a new low point for someone who ’s had so many low points			2
but the former chalet girl @entity140 does seem to have a knack of being able to rise from the ashes			2
and there are still investors — in the @entity104 at least — who feel the duchess of @entity6 ’s title retains enough royal cachet to make a buck			1
some believed she made a big mistake when , for £ 1.4 million a year , she became an ambassador for @entity164 , with whom she eventually parted company			1
chief among those who thought a lot more money could have been made was handsome @entity172 banker @entity171 , a one - time business adviser and president of the @entity175 charity , which closed two years ago			2
so keen was @entity0 on his money - making ideas that when he flew to @entity183 for business talks with her to impress him she sent her chauffeured @entity187 ( a £ 160,000 gift from an admirer , the @entity179 @entity178 frozen food magnate @entity180 ) to collect him from @entity190			2
seven years ago , she set about turning herself into a household brand name , endorsing products from jewellery and scented candles to fashion and food as well as raking in money from her children 's books where this would have led , we can only speculate			2
but @entity171 , a happily married man with three children , highly ambitious and very sensitive about his image , was horrified to learn people were wrongly suggesting he and the @entity5 might be having an affair			1
he backed away immediately from @entity0 and the project never got off the ground			2
but was @entity171 right about the @entity5 ’s selling power ? the fact that others think he was , indeed , right has had an electrifying effect on her ambition , says a friend			1
and now , it seems , she is determined to stand on her own two feet			2
her first step towards commercial reincarnation was to become ambassador for the @entity219			2
‘ she realised that if she was going to be an ambassador , she was going to have to do something about her own weight , which has always yo - yoed , ’ says a friend			2
she set herself a target ‘ to lose 50lb by my 55th birthday ’			1
it was clear to everyone at the @entity11 party that she has achieved it			1
these were just the first moves in the ultimate resurrection of the @entity140			2
they set the stage for a major commercial onslaught in which she will endorse schemes to help people with eating problems			0
an announcement about her new business enterprise is likely in the @entity242			0
‘ @entity0 really has one ultimate objective , ’ says a close figure			0
‘ she wants to be financially independent enough not to have to rely on @entity27 ’s generosity			0
she wants to do it within two years			0
’ just what could this mean — would she remain under @entity27 ’s protective royal custody or go ? for the past eight years , she has luxuriated in the @entity252 ’s home , @entity253 , the @entity255 ’s gracious old house in @entity256			0
he has spent more than £ 8 million on refurbishments , thanks largely to the £ 15 million ( £ 3 million more than the asking price ) he received from a @entity262 billionaire friend for @entity263 , their former marital home nearby			0
he did n’t share these proceeds with @entity0			0
after the house sold , it is understood that when the @entity20 asked what she wanted , @entity0 replied : ‘ your friendship , @entity271			0
’ living permanently , and apparently contentedly , with @entity27 — though , they insist , not as ‘ man and wife ’ — she is very much the mistress of the house			0
@entity0 has said her greatest pleasure of being there is walking in the woods and ‘ meditating on the bluebells ’			0
in her 2011 memoir , finding @entity72 , she described her perfect man : ‘ someone who is good - looking			0
with a good sense of humour			0
believes in old - fashioned chivalry , is confident , sophisticated , intelligent and athletic			0
who has integrity , honesty and is family oriented , and who knows me better than i know myself			0
’ since their divorce prince @entity27 has supported his former wife financially and allowed her to live in his home she added : ‘ i realise i have just described @entity27			0
’ a pity she did n’t seem to see him in quite that light when she was married to him			0
since the publication of the book , she has been keeping a relatively low profile , avoiding any outrageous gaffes and even declining tv appearances			0
meanwhile , she is working on a film project about @entity301 and regularly attends meetings of the trustees of her two main charities , the @entity304 and @entity15			0
she ’s also made quiet visits to @entity306 twice in the past year to see charity staff at work			1
last year ’s move to @entity6 by her youngest daughter , @entity45 , to work for an online auction house gave @entity0 a reason for monthly visits to the @entity104 at the same time , she was keeping up her old business contacts			1
when someone suggested a commercial rebirth , she did not need much persuading			0
but the old @entity0 that cut such a swathe across @entity104 was viewed as dead			0
as one of her former public relations advisers said : ‘ she threw away the golden opportunities that were presented to her when she left the @entity324			0
who on earth would buy anything with the @entity140 ’s name backing it now ? the revamped @entity0 is proof , say experts , that you can still make a comeback ‘ but times change and memories fade			0
a revamped @entity0 can sell herself as proof that , however down you are , you can still make a comeback — that ’s a very powerful selling message in @entity104			0
’ the rebranding began , quietly , in the summer when @entity27 arranged for her to stay at @entity340 with the @entity20			1
the visit was inevitably picked up by @entity104 social commentators			0
you could almost feel the excitement of investors in @entity0 ’s name that she was no longer the royal outcast			0
and there she was again , in @entity11			1
slim , full of exuberance , turning back the clock			0
as for @entity27 , four years ago on his 50th birthday , he made a comment that some of her friends thought in rather poor taste			1
the father of two drew laughter when he described himself as a man ‘ with three children ’			0
no such jest on this occasion			0
instead , his affection for @entity0 , despite all the scandal that has gone before , was clear			0
as for the way she looked at him : ‘ well , maybe she really does see him now in the way she described her perfect man in her book , ’ said one guest			0
the inevitable chatter among close friends is on the continuing topic of whether they might remarry — after her implacable opponent @entity377 , 93 , is gone			0
no one , probably not even the @entity20 , knows the answer .			0

@entity5 of @entity6 looks more put together now than ever before
she recently celebrated her 55th birthday with a party at @entity11
in the summer she was invited to stay at @entity340 with the queen
she has *due* to announce work *promoting* healthy foods in the new year
