i had a good cv , but getting into work was hard			0

’ mrs @entity3 , who returned to her work as a barrister after the birth of each of her four children , has been a frequent proponent of flexible working			1
last year , in an article calling for employers not to ‘ squander the talents of modern mothers ’ , mrs @entity3 wrote that bosses had to set a ‘ personal example ’ in adopting ‘ family - friendly policies ’			1
she wrote : ‘ we need to think about what we can do to support parents who want to prioritise full - time caring for a period when their children are young ... ‘ we all need to do more as individuals , as employers and as a community to make space for people to make these choices and rejoice in diversity in family life ’ she said stay - at - home mothers should get government funded training and subsidised salaries to encourage them to return to work and boost the economy			2
she suggested they should be given ‘ returnerships ’ – apprentice - style programmes for parents after long breaks from the workforce spent caring for their children			0
and in an interview in november last year , mrs @entity3 added : ‘ flexible working is really important but it ’s really important that firms do n’t look on this as “ the mummy track ” , i.e. , for those who are not going to make it			1
they need to acknowledge that part - time workers can make a real contribution			2
’ mrs @entity3 said the state could subsidise salary and training for the first six months that a parent , either a father or a mother , returned to work			1
she also argued that employers should be encouraged to create more part - time , family friendly jobs to tempt women back into employment			1
last night a spokesman for mrs @entity3 said : ‘ @entity3 ’s office is very small , but she does try where possible to offer part - time jobs to women with young children , indeed there are two other part - timers with children who continue to work there			1
