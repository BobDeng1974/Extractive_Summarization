' i ducked down and saw blood was streaming down			0
i screamed , " you shot me ! you shot me ! " ' i would liken it to somebody hitting you upside the head with a baseball bat , and you did n't expect it was coming , ' he said			2
mr @entity0 , who has served 28 - years with the sheriff 's office and also teaches classes on turkey hunting safety , was scouting private land in @entity47 for an upcoming turkey hunt when hit			1
he says he does n't know the shooter , identified as 27 - year - old @entity30 of @entity50 , and is n't sure whether the man was trespassing on the land or firing from off the property			2
all that confusion is what led him to immediately fear for his life			0
' i thought , " i 'm not going to die here			0
... i 'm getting out of here , ' " he recalled			0
mr @entity0 got up from the path he was walking on and drove himself to a nearby farm before he was transported to @entity62 in @entity63			1
