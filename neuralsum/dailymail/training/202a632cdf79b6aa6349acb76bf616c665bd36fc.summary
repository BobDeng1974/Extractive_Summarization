loose women returned for its 19th series today with a new look set and anchor presenter			1
but while the face may have been new to the show , it was a familiar one to tv viewers - as @entity9 , 74 , has taken the helm			1
the @entity12 show , which has been running since 1999 , also had a new logo and opening credits			1
but it did n't go down well with all of their viewers			0
@entity32 wrote : ' @entity34 show			2
' @entity36 added : ' i did not like the new set ... table too small ...			0
did n't like the changing colours behind special guest ... the tune has changed ...			0
unforgivable ! ! ! ! ! ' meanwhile @entity43 , who was a member of the live audience today , wrote : ' really thought that i would like to see the show live but not after today 's show			2
bring back the old girls they were entertaining			0
' revamp : returning for its 19th series , the show also has a new set and logo @entity53 agreed			1
she wrote : ' i much prefer the original panel , wo n't be watching as much ... do n't see @entity9 as a @entity56 sorry			1
' the ' old girls ' include former presenters @entity58 , 54 , @entity60 , 56 and @entity61 , 51			0
while they had a loyal following , they were often accused of ' ranting ' on screen			0
and sometimes their off - screen behaviour was talked about more than the news of the day			0
in a bid to reviving flagging viewing figures , it seems the show 's new editor , @entity72 has decided to turn to safe hands in the form of @entity9			1
he 's also hired former @entity76 legend @entity75 , 66			2
unlike some of their @entity56 predecessors , they both have wholesome reputations as devoted mothers and epitomise ageing gracefully			2
special guest : @entity83 appeared on today 's lunchtime show starting as they mean to go on : it is hoped viewing figures will go up thanks to the new presenter , set and star guests - but not all viewers were impressed with the changes tempting @entity93 back to tv is a particular coup after she has been focused on novel writing in recent years and once swore she was finished with presenting			1
she said last week that she was excited about joining @entity56			2
' i know i said i would n't go back on the telly , but actually i 'm looking forward to occasionally contributing to lively conversations between a group of outspoken and intelligent women , ' she said			0
when he revealed the new line up last week , @entity72 said : ' i 'm delighted we have been able to confirm more of @entity108 's best loved , successful , assertive and , let 's face it , downright smart women to join our loose women team			0
' at a time when many tv programmes have been accused of being ageist for ditching older stars , the @entity12 show has embraced veteran presenters			1
new additions : @entity75 , left , and @entity116 are also joining @entity56 also on board is former x factor judge @entity116 , 61 , while model @entity118 , 43 , represents a younger demographic			1
@entity9 said that she thinks the age range of the panellists will enhance the debate on the topical show			2
she said : ' i am a great fan of the show and i 'm really thrilled to be joining the team			0
i love a good debate and it 's such a great challenge to be discussing the important issues of the day with women that span different generations - our opinions will certainly be very diverse ! ' the show is also very joyful and i 'm looking forward to having lots of fun with the @entity56 - a girl could n't ask for more ! ' the hosts and panel will rotate based on the presenters availability , so on today 's show , @entity9 was joined by @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity25			1
the topics up for discussion included @entity146 ' payrises and the plight of @entity148 , while they welcomed special guest @entity83 , 81 .			0

@entity9 , 74 , has taken the helm of @entity56
@entity75 , 66 , is also to join the panel of @entity12 lunchtime show
veteran presenters brought in to revive viewing figures
19th series returned today with new set and opening credits

they said show has been too americanised
