are they friends or foes ? best of enemies ? it did n’t look that way when @entity5 and @entity6 shook hands before kick off at @entity8 ’s			1
the pair previously worked together at @entity10 and @entity11 , and much of the build - up to the game centred on their apparent feud			1
but there was a cordial exchange between the technical areas when the teams made their way out on to the pitch			0
@entity6 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) had a cordial exchange before the game @entity5 ( left ) did appear more friendly with @entity23 though , before meeting old foe @entity24 afterwards @entity24 ( left ) watches on as @entity5 makes his way past the rest of the @entity29 backroom staff to his dugout christmas day truce remembered respect to the @entity32 initiative between the @entity33 and the @entity34 because it has been warmly received by supporters up and down the country over the weekend			1
@entity39 and @entity29 players stood together before kick off , just the way it should be at this time of year			0
before the game , as with all matches over the weekend , the players paid respect to the @entity47 truce @entity48 @entity39 's cheeky programme editor recreated a @entity51 - style comic strip of the infamous afternoon when @entity29 were 3 - 0 down in their grey shirts at half - time down at the old @entity54			2
they changed to blue at the break after @entity29 players complained they could n’t make each other out			0
they still lost 3 - 1			0
@entity60 joins injury list @entity60 's 19th minute injury means he joins @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 in the bulging treatment room at @entity70			1
@entity60 ’s injury means @entity72 , who replaced him on monday , will start against @entity73 on sunday			0
@entity60 ( left ) had to come off after 19 minutes , adding his name to the long @entity70 injury list @entity60 looked disappointed to leave the pitch after such a short amount of time after his injury tough fixture list the fixture list has certainly been cruel to @entity5 and his team , but the @entity33 will maintain that successive games against champions @entity83 , @entity86 winners @entity85 and @entity29 in the league is random			1
whatever it is , it has n’t suited @entity39			0
@entity39 's fixture list has proved difficult , and monday night was no different as they lost 2 - 1 to @entity29			2
