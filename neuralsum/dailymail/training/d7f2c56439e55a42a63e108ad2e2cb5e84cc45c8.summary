@entity0 has launched a pilot scheme selling strangers access to users ' inboxes			1
the social networking website has introduced a fee , believed to be $ 1 , to guarantee that messages are routed to a recipient 's ' inbox ' and not their ' other ' folder , where they are likely to be ignored			1
@entity0 has billed it as giving users the chance to hear from people they do not know but who have an ' important ' message for them			2
it argues the fee will actually cut down on the amount of unwanted messages			1
networking : @entity0 will guarantee a message is routed to a user 's inbox but the trial , which began yesterday , has sparked fears that businesses will be happy to pay such a low charge and bombard people 's inboxes with advertising			1
@entity0 previously only allowed messages into an inbox if the recipient was ' friends ' with the sender			1
it also uses algorithm calculations to let ' relevant ' messages through , such as those sent from a ' @entity39 '			2
all other messages are routed to the other folder , similar to a junk or spam email filter			1
@entity44 : @entity0 allows friends to message each other instantly @entity0 said the @entity48 pilot involves only a ' small number ' of individuals and is limited to one message a week for each inbox			1
a statement on its website said the ' experiment ' is also limited to ' personal messages between individuals '			1
experiment : the pilot is running in the @entity48 and open to a ' small number ' of people @entity0 is testing a new look layout for its users ' profile pages			1
tabs replace the ' friends ' and ' photos ' thumbnails to make a cleaner looking menu towards the top of the page			0
the user 's name is lifted into the cover photo , while the timeline has also been given an overhaul			0
the chronological updates appear in a single line on the left of the page , with photos and friends information running down the right			0
this replaces posts appearing on the left and right of the page , which often makes it difficult to follow the chronology			0
a @entity0 spokesman told @entity93 : ' this is a new design @entity0 is testing with a small percentage of people to make navigating timeline even easier			0
' users also do not have to navigate away from a profile page to view a person 's friends or photos			0
they instead scroll down to below the ' about ' information			0
it continued : ' several commentators and researchers have noted that imposing a financial cost on the sender may be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and facilitate delivery of messages that are relevant and useful			2
' ' if you want to send a message to someone you heard speak at an event but are not friends with , or if you want to message someone about a job opportunity , you can use this feature to reach their @entity121			0
' for the receiver , this test allows them to hear from people who have an important message to send them			0
' writing on allthingsd.com , technology journalist , @entity127 , highlighted that users can not opt out of receiving the paid for messages			2
he also said @entity0 will look to ' tinker ' with the $ 1 fee over time , but added : ' the one - message - a - week cap , combined with the $ 1 fee , will prevent your inbox from filling up with spam			1
' @entity0 has also tweaked its message settings , with users able to select a ' basic ' or ' strict ' filter			0
the latter means a person will receive ' mostly ' messages from friends in their inbox			2
anyone who previously selected the ' friends ' setting will automatically have their messages set to ' strict '			2
