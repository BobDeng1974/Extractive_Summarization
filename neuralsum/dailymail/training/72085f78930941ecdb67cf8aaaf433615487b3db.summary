@entity16 , the chief constable of @entity15 , first raised the alarm when he reported the sighting on @entity18			1
' one of our officers was flagged down by a bus driver today , claiming to have seen a 6ft crocodile under @entity47			1
we ca n't find it , ' he wrote on the social media site yesterday			1
when asked by one @entity18 user whether there was a crocodile on the loose , mr @entity16 replied : ' it may mean precisely that , madam			1
no need to stay indoors - but you may want to think twice before you go water - skiing			1
' today , officers in @entity59 posted a photo of the river on @entity18 and said : ' we have seen the reports & searching @entity64 and @entity65 in full riot gear as we speak			1

sighting : the reptile was reportedly lurking below @entity75 in the city centre raising the alarm : @entity16 wrote about the alleged sighting on @entity18			1
he advised people against ' water - skiing ' a leading reptile expert has revealed that a crocodile could survive in @entity5 's waterways but it would be a struggle			1
dr @entity86 , is an @entity87 zoologist who works in @entity88 , @entity89 , home to some of the world 's largest saltwater crocodiles			0
the scientist , who studied for his @entity95 in @entity5 , said a number of people in the @entity98 do keep the deadly predators as pets , but while it could survive in the wild in @entity98 , it would n't last for long			0
he said : ' assuming it is a genuine sighting it would almost certainly have to be an escaped or released pet			1
quite a few people in the @entity98 keep crocodilians			0
' let 's say it was a crocodile			2
crocodiles are resilient creatures , they can tolerate a wide range of temperatures , and can even survive brief periods of freezing temperatures			0
' some species like alligators can find shelter to stay warm when it freezes , or even remain underwater to act as a temperature buffer			2
' the animal would be extremely lethargic under those conditions			0
it 's a challenge for any crocodile to survive those conditions and it 's unlikely to last long			0
' in terms of food , if it 's stressed it probably wo n't eat very much , especially not when it 's so cold , but if it were to survive into the warmer months it would take a variety of small mammals , fish , amphibians , even birds			0
i do n't rate its chances though			0
' dr @entity86 revealed that if it was a six - foot crocodile , it would only be a few years old			1
but a six - foot caiman , which is a species of alligator , would be closer to full size			1
he added : ' another possibility is that it was misidentified , in which case it could have been something like a monitor lizard or possibly even an iguana , which to the untrained eye could look a bit crocodile - like			2
' both monitors and iguanas can swim to add to the effect			0
it 's also possible of course that it was nothing of the sort , but you 'll have to speak with the guy who spotted it to learn more about that			0
at large : staff at @entity35 confirmed the animal had not escaped from one of their enclosures mr @entity20 first spotted the creature under @entity47 , in @entity5 , at around 9.05am at the beginning of february ( stock picture ) even though the animals are normally found in warmer climates such as @entity89 and @entity171 , it is not there has been an alleged siting of a crocodile or alligator in the @entity98			1
