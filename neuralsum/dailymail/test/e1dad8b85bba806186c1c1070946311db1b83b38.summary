@entity0 looks set to come under renewed pressure to explain herself after a letter revealed she had been asked about her use of private email by a @entity7 committee two years ago - but refused to answer			1
representative @entity8 asked then secretary of state @entity9 whether she , or any of her senior staff , had used a personal email account ' to conduct official business ' in december 2012			1
but @entity8 , who wrote as chairman of the @entity6 , was ignored until more than a month after @entity9 had stepped down in february 2013			2
and even then , the reply did not answer the question - instead going into detail over the @entity18 's email policy			1
silence : representative @entity8 ( left ) asked the @entity18 about the use of personal email for official business in december 2012 , but did n't receive any answer until @entity9 ( right ) had left the department the leaked letter , obtained by the @entity26 , casts a further shadow over @entity9 just days into her bid to become the @entity31 's 2016 presidential candidate			1
the former first lady found herself at the centre of a storm in recent months after it was revealed she used her personal address during her time as secretary of state			0
even her @entity39 profile picture was dragged into the row : it showed her on her @entity41 apparently sending emails while en route to @entity43 in september 2011			0
but there is no record of any emails on her official account that day - and she has since removed the picture from her account			0
@entity9 has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account , calling it a matter of ' convenience ' , admitting to deleting thousands of emails			0
@entity9 , however , has insisted every relevant email was now in the hands of the @entity18			1
but critics say by using her personal email account , she has avoided scrutiny			2
the presidential hopeful handed over 55,000 emails sent from her personal email account between 2009 and 2013 - her time as secretary of state - but it is not yet known what they contained			1
however , it has already been claimed that the documents have ' huge gaps '			0
shadow : @entity9 is likely to want to play down this latest revelation as she begins campaigning in @entity71 campaigning : @entity9 is hoping to win over voters with a more personal approach than in 2007 @entity9 is likely to want to play down these latest revelations , as she begins a campaign for nomination which is set to last until the end of june next year			1
a @entity9 aide told the @entity26 on tuesday ' her usage was widely known to the over 100 department and @entity83 government colleagues she emailed , as her address was visible on every email she sent '			0
@entity9 is currently on a two day tour of @entity71 , opening her 2016 campaign with visits to a family - owned produce company and speaking with small - business leaders outside @entity92			2
the decision to focus on smaller , more personal interactions during the campaign is in stark contrast to 2007 , when she spoke to huge crowds			0
