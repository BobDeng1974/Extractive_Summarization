click here to read the full match report @entity3 's future at @entity4 was in fresh doubt on sunday night after @entity6 axed the @entity8 star from his squad against @entity10			1
the move backfired as @entity4 suffered their first defeat at home to @entity10 in the league for 27 years , and failed to have a single shot on goal at @entity17 for the first time since may 2009			1
@entity3 ’s omission was a major surprise and will inevitably raise questions over his prospects of persuading @entity4 to spend £ 52million to turn his loan from @entity24 into a permanent move at the end of the season			1
@entity3 was not included in @entity6 's squad to face @entity10 on sunday @entity3 trains ahead of @entity4 's clash with @entity10 on friday @entity30 ( centre ) strips off to celebrate his goal in @entity10 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity34 @entity4 players trudge off at @entity17 after failing to register a single shot on target the former @entity39 and @entity40 striker , who earns £ 280,000 - a - week at @entity17 , had started the previous five games and scored twice			1
but he was left out of the 18 - man squad altogether with @entity43 choosing to name teenage striker @entity44 and no fewer than three centre - backs on the bench			1
@entity4 ended the game with @entity48 up front alongside @entity49			1
it is understood that the @entity4 boss had not explained the reasons for his decision to @entity3 , and the player then watched the 1 - 0 defeat from a private box			1
‘ @entity3 is n’t injured he ’s just not selected in the squad , ’ said @entity43 , who admitted beforehand that one of his star forwards would have to miss out now they are all fit			1
‘ it ’s much more difficult selecting a side but that ’s the task of the manager and i have a staff who advise me as well			2
‘ we have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row			2
then i have to compare players with each other			2
@entity10 boss @entity73 ( left ) would have enjoyed getting the upper hand over @entity6 @entity3 was a surprise loan signing with @entity4 given the option to buy him outright at the end of the season the on - loan @entity24 striker has spoken of his desire to remain at @entity17 beyond this season the @entity82 international has only started eight @entity84 games since his arrival ‘ now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment			1
next week is another moment			2
‘ when you see the composition of my bench i do n’t have ( room ) for a second striker			1
‘ you have to compare players before the match , and after the match you can say you could have won if a player had participated but you shall never know			2
‘ it is a bad result			2
when you are dominating the game like we did , you have to create more chances			1
@entity10 came for a draw , i believe , and they go away with a victory and that is disappointing			1
we gave the goal away			2
’ @entity3 appeared to be settling into @entity107 football after regaining full fitness following a serious knee injury and a calf problem			1
@entity10 boss @entity73 admitted that he expected to see the striker in @entity4 ’s starting line - up			1
‘ i was surprised but i do n’t know the reason , ’ said @entity73			0
‘ if he is injured , it is normal			0
maybe it is a good question to mr @entity43			0
’ @entity30 ’s 69th minute goal ended @entity4 ’s 11 - game unbeaten run in all competitions and saw @entity10 move above @entity43 ’s side into third place in the @entity84			1
@entity3 has reportedly taken time to adapt to @entity4 manager @entity6 's precise philosophy the 28 - year - old celebrates scoring his first @entity84 goal against @entity126 in october @entity73 believes that his team are capable of staying there for the rest of the season to qualify for the @entity131			1
‘ if we keep the spirit and the organisation , we can keep in front in the table , ’ he said			0
‘ we got a point against @entity138 and the three points against @entity140			0
that makes belief in the players			0
that is what you need if you are not a big club , not to be afraid of the name or the stadium			2
i am not surprised we won today			0
we have 11 clean sheets in 21 games			0
‘ they ( @entity4 ) did n’t create much			1
the second half was more comfortable			0
they put @entity48 up front , played the long balls and it was difficult			0
but we defended well and the spirit was unbelievable			0
’ @entity73 was unhappy with @entity30 after he was booked for taking off his shirt in celebration when he scored just six minutes after coming off the bench			2
the @entity160 ’s introduction was delayed because his @entity162 jersey was back in the dressing - room and he had also lost his shin pads			2
@entity73 celebrates with @entity10 goal scorer @entity30 after the final whistle on sunday the former @entity167 manager issues instructions to his team during the match at @entity17 @entity30 and his @entity10 team - mates celebrate after he scores in the 2 - 0 win against @entity140 ‘ it is a yellow card and a stupid fault , ’ said @entity73			1
‘ your second and it is a red			0
when it is the last minute of the season and you have qualified for @entity179 , it is not problem			0
but i do n’t like that			0
’ @entity30 defended his actions , saying : ‘ when you score a goal you do n’t think about celebrating			0
you do what you feel in the moment			0
i do n't know why i took my top off , i never do that			0
but there is always a first time			0
‘ in the first half i put the shirt and shin pads there and then in the second half i wanted to come on and they were not there			0
i do n’t know what happened			0
’ @entity4 skipper @entity49 insisted that they only had themselves to blame after suffering a first defeat since the @entity201 derby in early november			1
‘ i think we deserved to win the game today , ’ said @entity49			2
‘ overall we had the better chances , played the better football and deserved to win but we ’ve been punished for not taking our chances			0
‘ i ’ve seen @entity10 play better , to be honest			1
we stopped a lot of their threats but we got punished with the goal they scored			0
‘ we ’re not fussed how big or small a day it is for @entity10 , we ’re focussed on us and we have to move on			1
