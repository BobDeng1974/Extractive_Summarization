by @entity0 - jones published : 05:20 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 05:58 est , 15 january 2014 blunder : @entity3 has apologised after accidentally sending out results of its worst - performing students in an email an @entity9 college has upset its students after accidentally sending out a list of the worst performers to hundreds of their fellow undergraduates			1
the embarrassing leak revealed the names and grades of students at @entity3 who had the lowest marks in the pre-christmas exams			1
known as ‘ collections ’ , the exams are used to check whether pupils are on track to a good final grade , but do not go towards their degree mark			2
but almost 50 who achieved a 2:2 grade - a mark below 60 per cent - or worse in the @entity30 collections had their results sent to fellow students			1
the information was contained in an @entity35 document accidentally sent out by @entity36 , an academic administrator at @entity3 , which counts @entity37 and @entity38 among its alumni			1
it showed the worst - performing students in the college , as well as their percentage mark and their degree subject			1
officials have not revealed how many students received the email but it is thought it was sent to hundreds at @entity3 - known as ‘ @entity3 ’			1
staff quickly asked students to ' please delete the email previously sent out as it contained inaccuracies '			1
one of the students affected , who did not wish to be identified , told student newspaper @entity52 : “ i do n’t ever want to do collections again			2
' i was pretty gutted after my results last term , but did n’t realise i would be publicly humiliated			2
i ca n’t even go into college any more			0
' i want a full explanation from the college			0
i would sue but there are apparently no decent lawyers at @entity3 ' exam ' humiliation ' : students were left dismayed after the worst performers had their results included in an email to fellow undergraduates ( file picture ) @entity70 , a second - year law student said : ' i personally find it quite funny but i understand why some people might be upset			1
' another student said : ' of course , everyone on the list is just trying to laugh it off			0
' but in reality , no one feels comfortable with having something so personal shared with the entire college			0
' it ’s hard not to feel everyone ’s talking about you			2
' @entity83 , head of the college 's @entity84 , apologised to students after a meeting with senior tutor dr @entity88			0
she said : ' dr @entity88 has assured me that the document was sent accidentally and that the disclosure of results was not intentional			0
' the member of staff responsible is apparently mortified			0
the senior tutor has also told me that action will be taken with the academic office to insure that an incident like this never occurs again			0
