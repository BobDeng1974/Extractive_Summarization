by @entity1 reporter published : 09:52 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 02:01 est , 29 july 2013 @entity3 's plans for an island airport on the @entity5 might sound ambitious , but these drawings prove the idea has been at least 80 years in the making			1
vintage architects ' designs unearthed today show how floating hubs like ' @entity12 ' , with at least four runways , were already being planned in the 1930s			2
the mayor of @entity16 has been demanding the grand idea of an island airport made out of landfill with superfast links to @entity16			2
brave @entity22 world : this 1931 design for the centre of the @entity25 shows how airport docks should be built for the metropolis eye opening : the wonderfully named @entity29 argued for an airport to be built on @entity16 's roofs while in @entity33 they argued it should be in top of a @entity36 but it appears @entity39 architects had ideas even more dazzling and ahead of their time , which included placing an airport on top of city centre buildings in @entity16			1
designers in @entity22 also argued for a huge transport terminal in water , with an airstrip on top and a shipping port below			1
in @entity33 planners suggested a an airport was built in the sky above their @entity36			2
this month the mr @entity3 underlined his commitment to a futuristic estuary airport , either on the edge of the @entity5 or right in its heart			0
revolutionary : this spinning airport conceived by a @entity62 designer was planned so it could sit on the top of any major city , this plan said very similar : this one from @entity22 even looks like current plans for an estuary airport in @entity16 , while @entity67 off @entity68 would have had four runways too his first choice is sir @entity73 ’s plan for an airport on @entity76 's @entity75			1
mr @entity3 says it would be able to support more than 375,000 new jobs by 2050 and add £ 742billion to the value of goods and services produced in the @entity82			0
planes would fly in over the sea into the four - runway ' @entity85 ' , which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers and include an international railway station , which would include a service to @entity90 in 26 minutes			2
the @entity12 plan , designed by @entity94 firm @entity92 , would be artificially created from landfill in the heart of the estuary , and would be two miles north of the @entity98			0
ferries would link the site to @entity76 and @entity101 while a railway bridge could connect it to the mainland			0
vision : @entity85 ( pictured ) on the @entity75 has today been backed by the @entity105 above his own @entity12 plan because of its proximity to @entity16 new favourite idea : @entity3 has backed the four - runway ' @entity85 ' ( pictured ) in the @entity111 airport , which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the @entity75 in @entity76 elaborate plan : the @entity75 's proposed international railway station , which would include a service to @entity90 in 26 minutes the final ' compromise ' idea is an enlarged @entity119 , as the mayor is desperate to stop a third runway at @entity122			1
he is so bent on preventing it , that he 'd like to buy the west @entity16 site for £ 15billion to create a new borough for 250,000 residents			0
the mayor of @entity16 , @entity3 , said : ' the @entity82 needs to take a bolder approach than ever before to respond to our shortage of world - class hub airport capacity			1
and a four runway hub airport in either the outer or inner estuary or at @entity119 is both credible and deliverable			0
it is necessary to ensure that @entity16 and the @entity82 can continue to compete at the highest level in the world			0

designs from 80 years *ago* reveal ideas for revolutionary airports
one for @entity16 was proposed built on top of *housing*
in @entity22 architects *discussed* a hub - half airport - half sea port
