@entity6 ’s side have yet to concede a goal this pre-season and , despite a number of high - profile departures this summer , already look to be picking up where they left off last season			1
the @entity0 quickly asserted themselves of their @entity14 rivals and took the lead in the 20th minute when @entity16 headed home from a cross in the 20th minute in a well - worked attack			1
the visitors dominated their hosts immediately after the goal , creating a couple of good chances , including a wonderful opportunity for @entity44 , who impressed on the night , to double the advantage but the @entity48 ’s shot was blocked by the @entity3 goalkeeper			2

@entity3 ’s only real effort in the first half came in the 39th minute when @entity55 ’s cross looped awkwardly off @entity0 defender @entity64 but @entity61 scrambled the ball away from the danger area			2
left back @entity96 impressed in his bid to make the position his own since the departure of @entity100 to @entity101			0
the @entity102 thought they had equalised late on when an @entity104 free - kick was flicked past @entity61 but the linesman 's flag saved the visitors ' blushes			0
