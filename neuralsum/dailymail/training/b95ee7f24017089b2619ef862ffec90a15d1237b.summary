@entity0 has finally responded to claims she made up a story about being raped by an acquaintance in college , detailed in a passage from her new book @entity8 , and she 's sticking by her story			1
the star and creator of @entity13 's girls , wrote an essay on @entity15 to address reports claiming to have identified a man named ' @entity18 ' who matched the descriptions of the man who raped her after a party when she was attending @entity23 nearly a decade ago			1
the man interviewed by @entity25 and the @entity26 denied the claims , saying he never even met @entity0 during their time at the @entity31 liberal arts college			1
@entity0 has now clarified that ' @entity18 ' was just a pseudonym she designed to protect the identity of her attacker , who she never meant to identify in the story			1
instead , she says she wrote the essay to bring comfort to other victims like herself and that she intends to continue raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault on college campuses			0
while @entity0 admits her memory of the night is hazy , having been drunk and high on cocaine and @entity57 , she remains steadfast that she did not consent to having sex with @entity18 , who was aggressive and twice tried to pull off a condom during the assault			1
however , she says it took her a long time to process the attack as a rape , and reach a point in her life where she was comfortable enough to write about it and share it in her book			0
following the book 's release , some publications , including conservative websites @entity25 and @entity74 , sought to identify the @entity23 alumnus who raped the writer , using details from the book to narrow down the list of possible attackers			1
both @entity81 and @entity26 were led by their research to a man named @entity18 , who was a prominent campus @entity53 when @entity0 attended the institution			1
they looked for men named @entity18 , since @entity0 did not explicitly state that the attacker 's name was changed , as she did for other stories in the book			1
the man @entity25 identified as ' @entity93 ' ( to protect his real name ) vehemently denied ever meeting @entity0 , and says his reputation has now been tarnished because of the book			1
scene : it is believed the rape @entity0 describes in her book took place at @entity23 in @entity31 ( pictured ) in the winter of 2005 following a party he told the @entity26 that the experience of being connected to the attack was the ' most unfortunate coincidence of my life '			1
but in the @entity15 article published tuesday , @entity0 confirmed that ' @entity18 ' was not the name of her attacker , and that she 's sorry someone else has been falsely tied to the crime			1
' to be very clear , “ @entity18 ” is a pseudonym , not the name of the man who assaulted me , and any resemblance to a person with this name is an unfortunate and surreal coincidence			2
i am sorry about all he has experienced			0
' @entity0 went on to explain her reason for writing about the rape , saying she never meant for her rapist to be identified and she does not plan to press charges			1
' speaking out was never about exposing the man who assaulted me			0
rather , it was about exposing my shame , letting it dry out in the sun. ' i did not wish to be contacted by him or to open a criminal investigation			0
i am in a loving and peaceful place in my life and i am not willing to sacrifice any more of it for this person i do not know , aside from one night i will never forget			0
' while @entity0 says she expected the story might cause controversy , she did not think it would lead to assassinations on her credibility			2
@entity0 wrote tuesday 's response essay to stop the questions , which she believes have been ' used to cast doubt on other women who have been sexually assaulted '			1
@entity0 finishes the essay by saying she will continue to fight for change on college campuses , where rising rates of sexual assault have become a national concern			2
' @entity157 and response on campuses is only a small part of the problem with how we as a nation are handling sexual assault			0
but it ’s a good place to start			0
educational spaces must be made safe , so that we leave them stronger and poised to enact change , ' @entity0 writes			2
@entity168 , the attorney for the man named @entity18 , said he had received a statement from @entity171 promising to make clear that @entity18 is not a real name in any form - although the publisher has not made any public statement itself			1
' the statement ignores the fact they let my client hang out there for two months , he ’s been damaged , ' mr @entity168 said			0
' we are gratified that they put it out there my client is n’t that guy , but we 're not completely satisfied , ' we have n't heard from @entity0 herself , just the publisher and we want to hear from her at some point exonerating " @entity18 "			1
' @entity0 is the only person with first - hand knowledge who can truly clear my client ’s name			2
' mr @entity168 - who confirmed to @entity18 had never actually met ms @entity0 - added : ' my client reached out to ms @entity0 's literary agent as early as october 6			1
he had three reporters contact him within a 48 hour period and he noticed his @entity195 views skyrocketed into the hundreds			0
' he was called at work and at home			0
he was told by ms @entity0 's agent ' let 's not fan the flames ' , but then watched , to his dismay as she issued statements over @entity205 fanning the flames in a so - called ' rage spiral ' , adding more ambiguity as to the identify of this alleged rapist			1
' he added : ' until yesterday , we had really been treated with compete indifference			0
we are now in discussions with @entity0 and @entity213 to remedy this situation			2
' this book has already sold about 30,000 copies and will sell around a million copies , we need the book to be edited , so the confusion stops			0
' i believe the publishers are amenable to doing something like that			0
' the publisher acted as soon as it became public that @entity18 , with the help of his lawyer , had set up a legal fund to defend his reputation and has already raised nearly $ 24,000			0
@entity171 has also offered to pay @entity18 ’s legal fees accrued to date in the case			0
today , mr @entity168 released a statement saying while he welcomed @entity171 's offer to pay @entity18 's legal expenses , he found the publisher to have committed a ' grievous error			2
' and he added : ' our work , however , is not complete			0
@entity171 ’s offer to foot legal expenses already incurred fails to take into account the fact there are still ongoing legal expense because of their mistakes			0
' we will continue to keep the @entity247 campaign active to raise money for survivors of sexual assaults and for @entity18 ’s ongoing legal expenses until we receive an apology from ms. @entity0 and both ms. @entity253 and @entity171 have taken all appropriate steps to clear @entity18 ’s name and restore the damage caused to his reputation			2

@entity0 used her book to describe how ' @entity18 ' , a ' *flamboyant* @entity53 ' , raped her at @entity23
after the book was published this fall , some publications fact - checked @entity0 's account and found a man with the same name and descriptions
that man said he never even met @entity0 at *school*
@entity0 has now written an essay for @entity15 , saying she changed the name of her attacker and never meant to identify him
she also apologized to an @entity23 alumnus named @entity18 , who @entity25 and @entity26 said matched the rapist 's description
