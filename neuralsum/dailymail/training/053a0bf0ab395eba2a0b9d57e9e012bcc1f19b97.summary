by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 19:37 est , 3 november 2012 prisoners have been given telephones inside their cells despite ministers promising to crack down on perks behind bars			0
convicts at a young offender institution in @entity9 have become the first in state - run jails to be given personal landlines that they buy credit to use at any time of day or night			1
they can only ring numbers approved by the authorities and can not receive calls on the handsets , while the cost of installing them is being covered by @entity20			1
talk time : prisoners across the country could have access to a phone in their cell if a new pilot scheme is successful if the pilot scheme is deemed a success it could be copied in public sector prisons across @entity31 and @entity32 , having been used for several years in privately run institutions			1
but it is taking place at the same time as the new justice secretary , @entity36 , has vowed to stop prisoners spending all day in their cells watching television or playing video games			0
unions also fear that governors are putting phones in cells in order to reduce the amount of time that criminals spend on landings or communal areas , allowing them to reduce the number of guards required			0
@entity53 , director of the @entity54 , said : “ greater use of it could transform prison education , resettlement and family contact but as a complement to , not a substitute for , good professional staffing			0
“ no one wants @entity65 hi - tech prisons with everyone held behind their doors and no human interaction			1
” the deputy general secretary of the @entity71 , @entity72 , said : “ there must be safeguards that these phones are not used to contact , harass or intimidate victims			0
the same goes for drug dealing and organised crime			0
” justice secretary @entity36 wants to stop prisoners spending all day in their cells however he added that the move may reduce the number of mobile phones being smuggled into prisons			1
until recently inmates had to queue up to use phones on prison landings if they wanted to speak to friends or family , prompting a black market in mobiles brought in by visitors			0
many jails now allocate time slots for individual prisoners , who must give details of who they want to call , to use the public handsets			0
but some newly built jails run by private firms have started to feature phones inside cells , and now @entity101 has become the first state - run prison to install them			0
in the pilot scheme , selected cells on two wings have been fitted with telephones at the @entity110 institution , which is currently home to about 600 men aged between 18 and 21 who have been sentenced to up to four years behind bars			1
under the @entity20 system , they must set up a personal account that is accessed by a pin and give the authorities the names , addresses and phone numbers of the people they wish to call so a list can be approved			1
the calls are monitored and recorded by the authorities , and inmates are warned against saying anything linked to crime , escape plans , threats or coded messages			2
prisoners must buy credit to use the @entity136 and calls to landlines cost 9p a minute but ringing a mobile costs 20p a minute			1
there is no limit to how many calls they can make			1
inmates can also have televisions in their cells for £ 1 a week while those given “ enhanced ” status for good behaviour are allowed @entity150 consoles from home and can sleep on their own bedding			0
last month the prisons watchdog , @entity154 , said too many prisoners were “ lying on their backs in their cells watching daytime telly ” because of a lack of money and staff to give them useful activities			2
but some of the in - cell perks could be scrapped as ministers try to stop prisons being seen as “ holiday camps ”			2
a law is being passed that will allow jamming devices to block mobile phone signals in jails , while access to satellite tv channels could be removed			2
a spokesman for the @entity176 said : “ ministers are reviewing the policy around the incentives scheme for prisoners			2
it is crucial that these incentives are appropriately earned and that they have credibility with the public			0
“ a pilot scheme has been running at @entity187 which gives prisoners limited access to phones in their cells			1
in cell phones are subject to the same security controls that apply to phones on the communal landings , no prisoner can receive calls on this system			0
“ this pilot will be evaluated and the results considered along with the other benefits associated with the incentives scheme			1

the cost of the pilot scheme is being paid for by @entity20
if successful , it could be copied in prisons throughout @entity31 and @entity32
offenders buy phone credit but there is no limit to how many calls they make
