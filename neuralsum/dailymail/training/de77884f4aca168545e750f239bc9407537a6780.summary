@entity3 prices recorded their strongest monthly jump in three years in march as market conditions continue to blossom , property analyst @entity0 said today			1
the 0.3 per cent rise was driven by a boost to @entity10 house prices , with concerns over the crisis in @entity13 and the eurozone likely to send more cash flowing into the @entity16 capital in the coming months , the study said			1
the national increase in house prices this month marks the highest growth seen since march 2010			2
prices soared by 0.7 per cent month - on - month in @entity10 , showing the strongest uplift since february 2010			1

@entity10 has enjoyed strong demand from wealthy overseas buyers who see the capital as a ‘ safe haven ’ from the troubles of the eurozone			1
@entity35 , director of research at @entity0 , said that the latest crisis in @entity13 ‘ will only serve to further boost the flow of international funds into the capital ’			1
