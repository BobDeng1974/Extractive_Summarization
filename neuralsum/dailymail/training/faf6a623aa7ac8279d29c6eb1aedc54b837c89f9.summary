traditionally thought of as continental delicacy particular to @entity2 , it seems snails are crawling their way across the channel			2
according to food industry sources , @entity6 are demanding mollusc meat in ever increasing quantities - and @entity6 suppliers are struggling to keep up			2
@entity11 in @entity12 , owned by husband and wife team @entity15 and @entity16 , have expanded from indoor boxes to a 1,000 square metre field so they can increase supplies by as much as three times to meet demand , with the farm now housing around half a million snails			1
@entity24 at the @entity26 farm she owns and runs with her husband @entity27 the new ' free range ' fields will increase the snail harvest of the farm by up to three times to meet the growing @entity6 demand the farm has around half a million snails on it in both the indoor and outdoor pens the family - run farm supplies both snails and ‘ snail caviar ’ ( the snail ’s eggs ) to restaurants , brasseries , and retail - not forgetting individual customers for private consumption			1
though the traditional @entity2 way to serve escargot is to place them back into their shells after cooking , often marinating them in butter , garlic and parsley , @entity45 chefs are increasingly exploring the diversity of the humble snail in modern dishes			2
@entity11 owner @entity15 says the increased demand is due to people being more adventurous and more aware of their diet and what they eat			0
‘ people are buying tinned snails from abroad because @entity6 suppliers just are n’t meeting demands			1
snails breeding : the farm allows the snails to breed naturally by just placing them together the farm is run by @entity15 and her husband @entity27 ( left ) but their grand - daughter sometimes helps out with the harvest ( right ) ‘ @entity72 is a low fat , high protein meat , ’ she says , ‘ people nowadays are much more focused on their diet and eating healthily			1
‘ they are also much more aware of how their food is produced and where it comes from			2
‘ the new outside breeding area allows the snails to thrive as they are in their natural habitat			0
‘ our breeding methods are efficient and very sustainable and we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of care from hatch to harvest , keeping us at the forefront of fresh produce supply			0
’ the farm breeds @entity90 snails , which look very much like a garden snail			1
from eggs they are closely monitored until they morph into a tiny snail , at which point they are called hatchlings , taking a further four months to reach maturity			2
as well as three indoor breeding buildings , all of which are temperature and humidity controlled to suit the snails , the free range farm now runs from may to october , and will produce a harvest big enough to meet demand until the next harvest			1
snail caviar or ' @entity111 ' are the eggs snail lay and bury in the soil and are said to have a ' ferny ' salty taste @entity15 cleans and prepares the eggs ( left ) which are sold in 75 gram jars , costing £ 90 ( right ) the free range snails have a daily ‘ shower ’ via a sprinkler system and enjoy biscuits as well as their natural leafy food			1
from hatch to harvest is approximately 16 weeks at the farm			0
as snails are nocturnal and sleep during the day , harvesting them is relatively easy as they can simply be picked up			0
the snails are then purged to enable them to clear their digestive system - fed only water for three days - and hibernated prior to going out on order			2
as for the snail caviar ' @entity15 says : ‘ we have named them ' @entity111 ' , as they have a pearl - like appearance			1
‘ you could n’t compare them to sturgeon caviar as they are not at all fishy in flavour			2
‘ they have a slightly earthy , ferny taste and are fairly salty			1
‘ they are luxurious and add a glossy finish to a variety of dishes and also create a great talking point amongst diners , ’ @entity15 admits			0
@entity15 is one of the few producers of fresh snail caviar in @entity153 and like all caviar it is a tedious process to produce and to harvest and process just a few grams is a labour of love			1
the @entity111 are supplied in 75 gram jars , and are described as ‘ a luxury item with a price tag to match ' , costing £ 90 a jar			1
the snails themselves are gently braised by @entity15 before sale , and alongside the @entity111 , can be bought from their website , or at @entity167			1
snails lay around 100 eggs in each brood and bury them in the loose top soil by @entity24			1

most land snails are hermaphrodites with a full set of reproductive organs of both sexes , meaning they can all mate with any snail , and are prolific breeders			2
each fertilisation usually results in a brood of about 100 eggs which are buried in the topsoil , and will hatch , if not harvested , after 2 - 4 weeks			0
@entity26 owners @entity15 and her husband @entity27 collect the eggs from the soil and carefully clean them			1
@entity15 uses a fine - tipped paintbrush and magnifier to select the best ones , then cures them so they can be eaten raw			0
the white luminous eggs range in diameter from 3 - 6mm and are sold in 75 gram jars , for £ 90			1
these tiny eggs , which have a mineral finish can be marinated in herbs - the have a delicate taste			0
in the past they have been known as @entity222 ' for their supposed aphrodisiac quality			0
escargot pearls marry up beautifully with @entity225 , @entity226 , beef and many other protein dishes			0
they are also often used in canapes and as a garnish			0
look out for the @entity233 taste test of the @entity111 - coming soon ! the eggs , which have a ' woody ' salty flavour and have been known to have aphrodisiac qualities , are increasingly being used in restaurants as a garnish and to add a unique flavour			1
