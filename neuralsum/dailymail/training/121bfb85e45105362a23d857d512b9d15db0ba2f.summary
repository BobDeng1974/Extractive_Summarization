by @entity0 staying up all night and jumping over bonfires is probably not the best way to cleanse your body , but the ancient ritual of @entity5 is supposed to purify the soul			1
the pagan ritual is celebrated across @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 and originally marked the day of the summer solstice , but was moved to take place on the birthday of @entity14 after @entity15 became the dominant religion			1
today festivities include the traditional fire jumping , which is supposed to rid the soul of evil , with the highest jumper brought good luck for the rest of the year			1
girls also make wreaths of flowers and candles and the float them out across a lake to bring luck in love			2
the celebrations last all night and are supposed to ward off evil spirits and beings - including werewolves , witches and mermaids - who supposedly come out to prey on the souls of the wicked			0
@entity5 is a pagan ritual celebrated across @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 which used to mark the day of the summer solstice but was moved to @entity14 's birthday after @entity15 became the dominant religion the ritual involves jumping over bonfires to purify the soul , as it is believed witches , werewolves and mermaids come out at night to prey on the souls of the wicked unmarried women traditionally wear garlands of summer flowers in their hair during the day of festivities			1
tradition holds that whoever jumps highest over the flames will have good luck for the rest of the year after wearing flowers and herbs in their hair , girls float the wreaths out on to a lake with a candle			1
pictured right is a burning loop used to stoke the bonfires which represents the sun the girl whose candle burns the longest is supposed to outlive the others , while the girl whose wreath floats the longest is supposed to be lucky in love			0
boys often try to grab a wreath from the water , to attract the attention of the girl who floated it another tradition on @entity5 is trying to find the fern flower			2
it was rumoured that on this night only ferns could produce a bloom , and if somebody saw it , any wish they made would come true during the day women pick flowers which are woven into headbands or made into rings which are then floated across lakes			0
other traditions include playing pranks on one another , and swimming in rivers to cleanse the body @entity5 used to be a pagan tradition , but like many other ancient ceremonies such as @entity104 festivities , it was assimilated by the @entity15 faith @entity5 also marks an opportunity for couples to put their relationship to the test			1
partners leap over the flames holding hands , and if they fail to make the jump then their relationship is supposedly doomed romance was supposed to blossom around the time of @entity116 too			0
men and women would head into the woods to look for the fern flower , with unmarried women going first , followed by single men girls wearing traditional dresses from @entity10 jump over a bonfire near the town of @entity127 during ritual celebrations for @entity5 magic and mysticism still play a heavy part in @entity116 , despite its links with @entity15			1
festivities last all night as it is believed witches take their holiday at the same time , trying to cause as much harm to people as possible @entity5 used to mark the summer solstice on june 20 - 22 , but was changed to @entity14 's birthday , which used to be the june 23 on the old calendar			1
by the modern calendar , his birthday is on the 6th july , therefore breaking the link between festivities and the solstice the @entity116 festival is the opposite of the @entity150 festival , now held on @entity151 which involves walking house to house singing and collecting money - much like in @entity155 bonfire jumping forms part of the cleansing rituals held on @entity116 , with others including swimming in rivers and lakes , with the most purifying water believed to be had just as the sun comes up fire jumping can represent a test of couple 's love for one another , or a test of trust and courage for friends who decide to make the leap together @entity5 is a day - long celebration of fertility , fun , mischief and cleansing that is supposed to bring good luck and fortune to those who take part @entity5 is an ancient pagan ritual , which used to be known as just @entity116 - meaning to bathe			1
@entity5 - meaning @entity14 , as in @entity14 - was added after @entity15 came to the region and assimilated the festivities			1
the ritual was originally held on the summer solstice between june 20 and 22 , but was moved to the birthday of @entity14 , which was on june 23 by the old @entity192			1
the new gregorian calendar moved the date to july 6 , so the link with the solstice was lost			2
despite its associations with @entity15 , the festival still draws heavily on mysticism and folk - law			2
it is believed that witches also take a holiday on this day and come to do harm to people , and that werewolves and mermaids also emerge to roam around and attack the souls of the wicked			0
the day - long ritual is therefore designed around purity , supposedly cleansing the body and soul and providing protection , fertility and luck to those who take part			2
the main focus is fire - jumping , with the flames supposedly cleansing the souls of those who pass over it			2
couples who can complete the jump holding hands will have a strong relationship , while friends may also jump together to prove their loyalty to one - another			0
unmarried women also wear garlands of flowers and herbs in their hair during the day , and at night float the wreaths out on to a lake with a candle			0
the woman whose flowers float the longest will be lucky in love , while the longest burning candle denotes long life			0
it is also said that , on this one night , ferns are able to produce flowers , with whoever sights one of the blooms able to make a wish come true			0
villagers often take off into the woods in search of the blossoms , with unmarried women allowed to go first with single men following , in the hope that relationships might also blossom in the hunt			0
during the day , people play pranks on each other , bathe in rivers to cleanse their bodies , and pour water over each other			0
towards the evening fires are lit with poles with a flaming loop attached to the end , which represents the sun. these fires are then kept burning all night until morning to ward off any evil which comes near .			0
