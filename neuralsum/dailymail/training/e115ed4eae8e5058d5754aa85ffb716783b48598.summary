by @entity0 published : 15:45 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 02:45 est , 4 november 2013 how 's this for a line - up ? the guitarist has 78 fingers and 12 picks , the drummer has 21 sticks and six arms - and the keyboard player can flash multi-layered beams from its eyes			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 form @entity12 - a three - piece rock band made up of robots - and they made for a scary sight while performing at an art and technology event in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the group , who made their debut live performance in july , were created by a group of engineers and academics at @entity29 , who hope they will one day be able to perform in space			1
the band made their debut live performance last july rocker : guitarist @entity14 has a computer screen and cables coming out of its head - which give the impression of long hair when it moves its head back and forth			1
one video shows him playing at 1,184 bpm humans and robots : a man plays an electric guitar to control @entity14 during the @entity12 performance in @entity22 they were pictured today during the two - day @entity35 event at the @entity36 of @entity59 , four months after their first live performance in the same city			0
guitarist @entity14 has a computer screen and cables coming out of its head - which give the impression of long hair when it moves its head back and forth			1

and the idea behind keyboard player @entity68 projecting laser beams from its eyes is to give crowds a ‘ transcendental music performance ’			2
drummer @entity15 can play four times faster than humans			1
the robots – who have been sponsored by @entity77 , an alcoholic drink which rose to fame in the 1990s but is still popular in @entity22 - are programmed to perform based on the audiences ' reaction			0
also on display : a man wears the lightweight robot suit @entity85 which expands its users ' motions two times larger , during the @entity35 event at the @entity36 of @entity37 and innovation movements : the human powered robot suit , made of aluminum skeleton , is developed for the performance for screen and stage plays for example , in one concert , when audience members lifted up their bottles of @entity77 , the robots played harder			0
during that performance there were also dancers and singers on stage with the band			0
at their latest performance , @entity108 did not appear to be present , although it has played with the group on previous occasions			2

the human powered robot suit , made of aluminium skeleton , is developed for the performance for screen and stage plays			0
expectations : the scientists behind z - machines want @entity14 and his band - mates to play on the moon			2
