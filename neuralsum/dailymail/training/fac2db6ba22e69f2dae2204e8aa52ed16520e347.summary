@entity1 police have uncovered a huge ring operating on the ' dark internet ' - a seething matrix of encrypted websites allowing users to browse with complete anonymity			1
the year - long ' @entity8 ' uncovered a large haul of child pornography that had been made in @entity1 and was being distributed in four other countries			1
the operation has so far led to the arrests of 55 people , with police issuing a further 100 arrest and search warrants and suspects found in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity23 : the year - long ' @entity8 ' uncovered a large haul of child pornography that had been made in @entity1 and was being distributed in four other countries @entity8 was launched simultaneously in 18 @entity1 states and the federal district of @entity28 last year			1
during the year - long investigation , six children were rescued from suspected rapists and abusers			1
at a press conference in @entity34 , @entity35 of @entity36 do @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' we managed to identify people who were trying to distribute child pornography materials and also those who have abused children			1
' more than 90 people who shared the child porn images have so far been identified , with the majority of them known child abusers , he added			2
until now , only the @entity49 and @entity50 have managed to break into the dark internet , but @entity38 said @entity1 police have since been able to adopt the same investigative techniques			1
dark internet : normally , file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user 's unique ip address			0
the @entity60 on the @entity61 hides the ip address of the user @entity38 said a number of harrowing details emerged during the investigation , including one man who allegedly started planning the abuse of his child while his unsuspecting wife was still pregnant			2
the nature and extent of some of the abuse shocked and horrified even the most experienced officers involved in the investigation , he added			0
@entity8 is considered the latest example of @entity78 governments finally starting to address the problem of the sexual exploitation of children			2
earlier this week @entity20 broke up a child - trafficking operation in which children as young as 12 are believed to have been smuggled out of the country for sex			2
@entity60 - short for @entity60 - is a matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity			0
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online			0
normally , file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user 's unique ip address that can be traced back to an individual computer			0
the @entity60 on the @entity61 hides the ip address and the activity of the user			0
most of the @entity109 's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages do n't exist until created as the result of a specific search			0
an internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught , but a majority is deep and therefore missed .			0
