when a trio of @entity3 college students bought a smelly secondhand couch from a charity store for $ 20 they had no clue about its real value			1
but not long after roommates @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 got it back to their @entity15 home and nestled in , they discovered envelopes of cash - $ 41,000 worth - were stashed in every conceivable crevice of the pre-loved find			1
' when we were in the bedroom our neighbors thought we won the lottery or something cause we were just screaming , ' @entity11 said of the shock april discovery			2
but last month , after watching a movie , they said they felt crinkles in two side pillows built into the couch , according to @entity39 website			0
' it had these bubble wrap envelopes , just like two or three of them , ' @entity10 , a @entity44 geology major , told @entity45			1
' we ripped them out and was just like freaking out , like and inch and a half of hundred dollar bills			0
' perplexed by the discovery , the friends all but teared the couch apart looking for what else they could find			0
when all the envelopes were out , they eagerly counted the cash , taking pictures along the way			2
the grand total amounted to a staggering $ 41,000			1
' you keep counting more and more money and you get excited , like @entity10 was thinking about buying a car for his mom and a boat , ' @entity12 , a @entity44 graduate , said			1
pictures : the stunned friends took pictures with the loot as they went however , the students ' excitement turned to moral dilemma when they found that one of the envelopes had a woman 's name on it			1
' the entitlement very quickly went away with finding that notice with her name on it			0
because we did n’t earn that money , ' @entity11 , a @entity81 graduate , said			2
and so the hunt for the fortune 's rightful owner began , with the help of each of the students ' parents , who also warned them not to tell anyone else about the stash for fear it could get stolen			1
finally , @entity10 's mother found the woman in a phone book and the young man called her up			1
' i 'm like " i found something that i think is yours and she 's like " what ? ! " and i 'm like " i found a couch " and then she 's like " oh my @entity104 i left a lot of money in that couch , " ' said @entity10			1
the friends said the elderly woman , who wanted to remain anonymous , told them her sick husband had given her wads of cash in the years before he died , so she could have something to live off when he was gone			2
dilemma : however , the students ' excitement turned to moral dilemma when they found that one of the envelopes had a woman 's name on it not knowing where else to put it , she stashed it in the old couch in the room where she slept			1
she said she stored her savings int he couch for 30 years until she recently had an operation on her back and spent several months in a rehabilitation center			0
while there , her doctors recommended her children replace the old couch to aid her back pain , and that 's how it came to be at the @entity33			2
' we almost did n't pick that couch , ' @entity12 told thelittlerebellion.com			2
' it 's pretty ugly and smells , but it was the only couch that fit the right dimensions for our living room			0
' the trio said they do n’t regret doing the right thing , and are even planning to have dinner with the elderly woman they returned the money to and her family			0
' i think it ’s just that anyone can do good if they will themselves to it , ' @entity10 told @entity45			0
' i think it went the way it should and to be honest i do n't think about it that much , ' @entity12 added			0
but the good samaritans did n't go home empty - handed			0
the woman gave the three a thousand dollars to share as a reward .			0
