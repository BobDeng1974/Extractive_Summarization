the payout - which is likely to be around £ 6 million - will reignite the row over rewards at the state - backed bank following its £ 390m fine for rigging @entity16 interest rates			1
the jackpots will come from long term incentive schemes that were awarded in 2010 and are due to bear fruit in mid-may			0
in addition to sharing in a total of £ 6m worth of shares , the five are expected to receive an annual bonus for last year as well as their six or seven figure ‘ basic ’ salaries			1
@entity26 , the @entity28 peer , said : ‘ we put £ 45bn into @entity5 to get it lending again but it is still failing in its core purpose of lending to @entity32 business and it single handedly stopping the economy growing			2
‘ most long suffering taxpayers will find it quite wrong to see top @entity5 bankers collecting £ 1m plus bonuses when @entity5 is still failing to lend and failing the nation			1
’ the latest controversy comes hard on the heels of recent criticism heaped on chief executive @entity42 over a £ 780,000 delayed bonus award from 2010 that he is due to pocket next month			2
@entity5 has pledged to reduce its pay , bonus and incentive pot by £ 300m in order to cover the costs of its libor - rigging fine so that @entity32 taxpayers are not forced to pick up the tab for its misdeeds			1
it said it will also claw back bonuses paid in the past			0
but this will not include @entity57 ’s deferred bonus and nor has it derailed plans to make the lavish share awards to the five executives in his top team			2
@entity2 , who runs the bank ’s @entity64 operations , stands to receive the largest windfall of around £ 2.1m from two share awards granted in 2010 under long term incentive schemes			1
@entity69 , who is in charge of dealing with the bank ’s toxic loans , will bag shares worth £ 1.2m			1
chief executive @entity42 is due to receive a £ 780,000 delayed bonus from 2010 next month @entity75 , now in charge of the @entity5 ’s direct line insurance operation , stands to receive shares worth £ 800,000 while business banking supremo @entity79 will be awarded up to £ 900,000 worth			1
@entity80 , the group administrative officer who has announced he is leaving the bank , will get shares valued at £ 1m			1
@entity57 could in theory be awarded shares under the same long - term incentive plan			0
however , he is extremely unlikely to get any as he has not hit his targets for improving the bank ’s share price and its financial performance			0
finance director @entity91 is also thought to have failed these performance hurdles so will get no shares under these awards			0
the other five are in line for their shares because they had different targets from their bosses			0
@entity5 declined to comment but it is understood decisions are yet to be made on the exact number of shares that will be showered on the five executives			0
the bank ’s chairman sir @entity104 provoked outrage last week by telling the parliamentary banking commission that @entity57 ’s pay was ‘ relatively modest ’			0
@entity57 has agreed to give up his bonus annual bonus for 2012 because of the libor - rigging and the it meltdown that caused havoc with millions of customers ’ current accounts			0
the latest largesse to @entity5 executives comes amid speculation over the government ’s plans for its 82pc stake , currently worth around £ 13bn less than taxpayers were forced to shell out to buy it			2
options include a giveaway by chancellor @entity125 of free shares worth up to £ 400 for every taxpayer .			0
