@entity1 students tend to succeed because their parents invest time researching their education and encouraging their children into traditional jobs and not because of tough rules or habits introduced at home by so - called @entity10 , according to a new study 's findings			1
sociology professors @entity13 and @entity15 interviewed 82 adult children of @entity18 and @entity19 immigrants from @entity20 to better understand @entity1 ' success			1
the professors ' discoveries were a departure from the idea of @entity27 parenting – strict advice made famous by @entity29 in a 2011 column where she claimed @entity1 children succeed because of parenting rules among the community , including limiting free time , avoiding tv and subjects like gym and drama and ‘ insulting ’ her children until they reach top grades			0
the two academics found that though @entity1 parents aid their children , it comes from their determined research into the best schools and living in a community that prides traditional jobs and academic success above other achievement			1
no more ' tiger moms ' : the study 's found that socioeconomic factors may be the reason for @entity1 ' success -- as opposed to strict parenting techniques , like the ones made famous by @entity29 ( pictured ) this explains why @entity1 from poor families often succeed just as well as their richer counterparts , whose parents like @entity29 can invest heavily in extra-curricular activities like encouraging musical instruments and foreign languages			1
to do this , parents use the ' @entity67 ' : a whopping 1,500 - page directory that lists both @entity1 businesses in @entity70 as well as top high schools and universities			2
' doing well in school ' translates to ' getting straight a ’s , graduating as valedictorian or salutatorian , getting into one of the top @entity79 ( @entity79 ) schools or an @entity80 , and pursuing some type of graduate education in order [ to ] work in one of the ‘ four professions ’ : doctor , lawyer , pharmacist , or engineer , ' the researchers say			0
‘ so exacting is the frame for " doing well in school " that our @entity1 respondents described the value of grades on an @entity1 scale as " a is for average , and @entity99 is an @entity1 fail , " ' they add			2
@entity100 marks : professors @entity13 of @entity102 , left , and @entity15 , right , from the @entity103 conducted the study which casts doubt on ' tiger mom ' parenting it is not down to direct parent coercion but because as a member of the community they have their own measures of success and failure and tend to accord to them			0
these measures , though , may cause @entity1 students to feel alienated when they fail to meet them			0
separating ethnicity from achievement , the authors argue , would give @entity1 space to achieve success on their own terms			0
' @entity127 are increasingly departing from the success frame , choosing alternate pathways , and achieving success on their own terms , should give @entity1 immigrant parents and their children confidence that broadening the success frame is not a route to failure , ' @entity126 said in a press release for the study .			2

study interviewed 82 adult children of @entity18 and @entity19 immigrants in @entity20
found aid comes from parents ' researching and valuing academic success above other achievement
parents use ' @entity67 ' to find the best schools and universities
for children , ' @entity98 is for average and b is an @entity1 fail '
this explains why @entity1 from poor families often succeed just as well as their richer counterparts
