sources say @entity14 – who is incredibly close to @entity6 – could n’t handle @entity11 constantly going away with the pop star and living the high - life			1
the situation seemed to really start getting to the 27 - year - old in the days leading up to @entity6 ’s @entity53 arrest as she made a series of emotional tweets saying how unhappy she was			1
on january 16 she wrote ‘ this is all i need ’ and posted a longing quotation : ‘ i do n’t need a perfect one			0
. i just need someone who can make me feel like i ’m the only one ’			1
a week later @entity6 , 19 , was arrested in @entity61 , @entity62 , on suspicion of driving under the influence , driving with an expired license and resisting arrest without violence			1
@entity11 had accompanied his son on the controversial break			2
tattooed @entity11 – who has been jailed at least twice in the past – was heavily criticised in the wake of the incident with @entity6 ’s millions of fans accusing him of being a terrible influence			1
it was even suggested he was in an suv blocking the street to allow the drag race			0
the day after @entity6 was released from custody on a $ 2,500 bond , the father and son pair were pictured out partying			1
trouble : @entity6 with his father on the beach in @entity53 hours before his high profile arrest for drag racing under the influence : a source told @entity40 : ' if you look at a lot of @entity6 ’s controversial incidents over the past few months , @entity11 has been in the background			1
that is very worrying '			0
police yesterday released footage of @entity6 walking the line after his arrest and then on january 31 , @entity11 was present again when his son was accused of smoking marijuana on a private flight and verbally abusing a flight attendant			1
it seems everything got too much for @entity14 during that turbulent period and four days after the @entity104 arrest she wrote : ‘ hard to believe sometimes that things can get better ! trying to keep going ! ’ she followed that up with : ‘ ready for the next chapter ...			1
. wonder what it 's about ...			0
this is not the first time @entity11 ’s wild behavior has affected his family life for the worse			2
he split from @entity6 ’s mother , @entity113 , just 10 months after she had given birth to the future global superstar following a troubled on off relationship			2
according to @entity113 ’s autobiography , @entity117 , the teenagers were actually engaged , but called off the wedding when @entity11 cheated on her with a mutual acquaintance			0

a source told @entity40 : ‘ @entity11 has always been a bad boy			2
when he first got together with @entity113 he was a big drinker and loved to party			0
close : while @entity11 was not always around during his childhood , they seem to be inseparable recently blood : @entity6 and @entity11 got matching tattoos			1
those close to them say he 's more of a friend than a father ‘ he has always adored his son , but he was n’t mature enough to be a responsible parent and his lifestyle meant he could n’t be there for him like a father should be			1
‘ he got in trouble with the police and would often leave town , sometimes for months at a time			0
‘ and if the truth be told his attitude towards partying and living the high - life has never changed			0
again , he adores @entity17 and @entity145 , in fact they are incredibly important to him , but that has n’t altered his personality			2
‘ @entity6 hitting the big time in the way he has is an absolute dream come true for @entity11 and the temptation of being able to travel the globe , living like a superstar was too much to turn down			1
‘ @entity14 was always going to take second place to that			0
they are still on good terms for the sake of the children and she still has a great friendship with @entity6 , but their relationship has broken down			2
‘ @entity11 has the opportunity to party with beautiful girls in every city in the world			0
he was never going to let anything get in the way of that			0
’ the source added : ‘ the fact @entity11 can not seem to maintain a relationship is just another sign of how flaky he can be			2
he really is n’t the kind if role model @entity6 needs around him during this difficult time			1
party ! while @entity11 adores his children a source told @entity40 he has always been a wild child lonely : @entity14 and @entity11 have had an up and down relationship			1
they spent @entity45 last year together , but then around the time of @entity6 's arrest in @entity53 she began posting some emotional tweets looking for love : her postings made it very clear that she was no longer in a relationship ‘ @entity11 is more of a friend than a father			1
far from trying to keep @entity6 on the straight and narrow he is often the one encouraging him			0
’ throughout their relationship @entity14 has been referred to as @entity11 ’s wife , although it is unclear if they ever actually got married			1
they met around seven years ago in the @entity196 , @entity198 area , before @entity6 hit the big time			2

his father on the other hand is generally seen as a bad role model			0
