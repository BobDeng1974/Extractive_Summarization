by @entity0 payout : rugby league star @entity1 , 31 , pictured , has been awarded almost £ 150,000 in damages after @entity4 club @entity3 sacked him when a naked picture of his teammate was posted online a rugby league star has been awarded almost £ 150,000 in damages after @entity4 club @entity3 sacked him when a naked picture of his teammate was posted online			1
former prop @entity1 , 31 , was dismissed from the team on grounds of gross misconduct last october after a picture of a fellow player 's bottom appeared on @entity16			1
throughout the three - day @entity18 battle in @entity19 , mr @entity1 , who claimed wrongful dismissal , maintained his former club wanted to get rid of him because of his expensive contract and that the @entity16 picture was only a smokescreen			1
his honour judge @entity26 ruled in favour of the player and has now awarded him £ 146,000 in damages			1
after the hearing , mr @entity1 said he was going to @entity31 with his boxing friend @entity32 to celebrate			1
he said : ' it ’s been a stressful time and i ’m glad it ’s over			0
i will go away , enjoy myself , relax and re-charge my batteries			0
' i am still in great shape and training every day and i want to move on in my career			0
but first i ’m off to celebrate			0
' mr @entity1 , of @entity41 , @entity42 , was sacked a few weeks after a picture of then teammate @entity45 ’s bottom was posted on his @entity16 account where it stayed for around 48 hours			1
the court heard that the photograph was taken as the team celebrated after the final game of last season during a three - day ' communal bender ' known in the rugby league world as ‘ @entity55 ’			0
the club , even though it admitted it was posted without mr @entity1 ’s knowledge , said he brought them into disrepute by not deleting it soon enough			1
after playing seven seasons for the club , mr @entity1 was fired with nearly three years left on his contract			1
the player claimed he was sacked by the club to free up space in the salary cap for new signings			1
at the time of his dismissal the rugby ace was one of the team ’s highest paid players , with a yearly salary of £ 95,000			0
the total figure including legal costs will leave the @entity42 club - currently leading @entity4 - with a debt of around £ 400,000 - as mr @entity1 ’s legal fees are estimated to be £ 200,000			1
the club will also have to pay their own legal fees of at least £ 50,000			2
it was also revealed that mr @entity1 had offered to settle just days before the case went to court - for £ 100,000			1
but the @entity3 responded with a paltry offer of £ 5,000			2
dismissed : mr @entity1 , left , was sacked a few weeks after a picture of the bottom of teammate @entity45 , right , was posted on his @entity16 account where it stayed for around 48 hours ruling in mr @entity1 ’s favour last month , the judge said : ' when all is is said and done the claimant was employed as a rugby player			1
' i ’m not convinced that this tweet can been seen to be inextricably linked to the club			0
' i think it is very unlikely that anyone seeing this tweet would assume that the tweet is condoned by the club			0
' therefore i have no difficulty in finding the claimant has established on balance that this was a wrongful dismissal			0
' i am satisfied that the club was keen for the claimant to go			0
but this was not an unhappy player			0
he did not want to go , he wanted to stay			0
' the court hearing yesterday also heard that the @entity3 only disclosed vital documents by court order days before the case began			0
the documents related to who had made complaints about the @entity16 picture and about details of the signings of other players			2
sacked : after playing seven seasons for the club , mr @entity1 was fired with nearly three years left on his contract			1
this is the @entity124 where the @entity3 play judge @entity26 said the documents were ' clearly embarrassing ' and should have been handed over at the outset			2
he said : ' on balance i am entitled to assume that these documents were deliberately not disclosed and , if that ’s not the case , then significant efforts were not made ( to find them ) until the last minute			0
' @entity1 ’s counsel said he was entitled to ‘ indemnity costs ’ because of the club ’s “ dismissive attitude ” to the case			2
the judge ordered the club to pay mr @entity1 ’s £ 146,510 in damages within seven days			1
the club had previously been told to make a down - payment of £ 35,000 towards the legal fees but this was paid several days late			2
the judge ordered a further £ 5,000 to be paid			0
the exact costs have yet to be finalised			0
after the hearing , mr @entity1 ’s solicitor @entity147 confirmed his client had been on a ‘ no - win , no - fee ’ arrangement , which means a win bonus of between £ 75,000 and £ 100,000 payable on top of his £ 98,000 legal fees			1
mr @entity147 said : ' it has been a resounding win and @entity1 has been vindicated in taking the action he did			2
@entity1 has only done what he is entitled to do and i hope @entity3 comply with the court order			2
' the indemnity order sent a clear message that the judge was disatisfied with the way @entity3 conducted the case by trying to conceal significant documents			2
' @entity1 , who is coming to the end of a 12 - month deal at @entity167 , said he wanted to stay a @entity4 player			1
@entity3 managing director @entity169 declined to comment .			0
