by @entity0 hundreds of lives could be saved each year after @entity3 scientists worked out how to stop a potentially deadly outbreak of @entity5			1
they have managed to crack the superbug 's genetic code , enabling them to identify and destroy the source of the infection , stopping it in its tracks			1
it led to them finding one member of staff at @entity18 , in @entity19 , who may have unwittingly carried and spread the infection			1
this is the first time such testing has been used to identify and halt an outbreak			1
one expert said this would soon become ' standard practice ' in hospitals			2
scientists in @entity19 used the technology to identify a member of staff who may have been unwittingly carrying and spreading the infection @entity5 ( methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ) is an antibiotic resistant form of a common skin bug that can cause potentially deadly wound infections in hospitals			1
there were around 1,000 deaths from @entity5 and 4,000 deaths from @entity41 each year in the mid- 2000s			0
@entity42 rose significantly in the 1990s from just 100 a year to a peak of 7,700 in 2003 to 2004			0
following the launch of the @entity47 campaign in hospitals , rates fell steadily but more than 1,000 people still developed the infection in 2011 - 12			2
in an early test of the new technology , researchers halted an outbreak of the @entity5 superbug in a special care baby unit at the @entity18 in @entity19			1
by quickly identifying the bacterial strains from their genetic codes , or genomes , experts were able to target the transmission path of the infection and cut it off			1
a report on how the baby unit outbreak was brought under control appears in the latest issue of the journal @entity68			0
the scientists used a technique called rapid whole genome sequencing , which maps an organism ’s entire genetic code , to analyse @entity5 bacteria taken from 12 babies			2
standard procedures had not been able to show whether a genuine outbreak had occurred , or whether the babies had all coincidentally been exposed to @entity5			0
the team was quickly able to confirm that 10 babies were part of an @entity5 outbreak involving a previously unknown strain of the bug			0
it also became clear from swab tests of parents and visitors that the bacteria had spread outside the hospital into the community			0
measures were introduced to clear @entity5 from carriers and deep - clean wards , but two months later a new infection case was identified in the baby unit			2
in an early test of the technology , researchers halted an outbreak of the @entity5 superbug in a special care baby unit at the @entity18 in @entity19 dna sequencing showed it was caused by the same strain identified earlier , carried to the ward by one of 154 screened health care workers			1
co-author dr @entity108 , head of pathogen genomics at the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 , said : ' the staff member was decolonised and went back to work , and we believe this brought the outbreak to a close			1
' the scientists are now developing the concept into a simple system that can be used routinely by hospital staff who are not genetics experts			1
in future , it could be used to combat many kinds of infection outbreak , and also help doctors decide the best way of treating patients			2
the bug - busting ' black box ' is being developed that can rapidly identify the source of hospital infections and help staff to stop them spreading			1
the device , which combines sophisticated dna profiling and database analysis , could be available within ' a few years ' , say scientists			2
professor @entity142 , from @entity143 , who led the research team , told a news briefing in @entity146 : ' what we ’re working towards is effectively a ‘ black box ’			0
' information on the genome sequence goes into the system and is interpreted , and what comes out the other end is a report to the health care worker			0
' it could , for example , determine the species of the bacterium ; it could determine antibiotic susceptibility , and it could provide information about what genes are present that are often associated with poor outcomes in patients			0
' it will give information about how related that organism is to other organisms within the same setting , giving an indication of the capability of transmission from one patient to another			0
' dr @entity108 added that he expected the cost of whole genome sequencing of bacteria to fall from around £ 100 per sample to £ 50 , and ultimately just ' a few pounds ' in the near future			0
the @entity5 outbreak at the @entity18 , part of @entity184 , was estimated to have cost the @entity185 around £ 10,000			0
this was double the cost of the dna sequencing , said the researchers			0
dr @entity190 , consultant microbiologist at the @entity191 and infection control doctor at @entity193 in @entity19 , said : ' what we have glimpsed through this pioneering study is a future in which new sequencing methods will help us to identify , manage and stop hospital outbreaks and deliver even better patient care			1
' a @entity191 report in may said more than six per cent of hospital patients in @entity203 acquired some form of infection during their stay .			2

@entity19 scientists used the technology to identify a member of staff unwittingly spreading the infection
by identifying the bacterial strains , experts were able to halt the infection
