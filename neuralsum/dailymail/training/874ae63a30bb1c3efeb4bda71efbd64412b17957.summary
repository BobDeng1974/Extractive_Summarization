@entity0 put his recent woes behind him as he eased to victory in his first - round match at the @entity5 on monday			1
@entity0 's 2014 season had ended with defeat by 17 - year - old @entity8 in @entity9 and this year on tour began with a shock loss to world no 127 @entity13 in @entity14			1
but the @entity16 world no 3 was in fine form in his opener at the first @entity19 of the year in @entity20 as he took just one hour and 50 minutes to beat @entity21 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2			1
@entity0 salutes the crowd after winning his first round match against @entity21 @entity0 celebrates his straight - sets victory over @entity21 in the first round @entity0 said : ' it was a very positive result for me			1
i think a very good start is very important			2
' always before the first match you always have the doubts , especially in the situation i 'm arriving here			2
every match is very important for me today			0
it was a comfortable victory that gives me some confidence			0
' @entity0 has never lost a set in the first round here in @entity20 and never on monday did that run look like ending on the @entity40			1
@entity42 world no 49 @entity21 can be a wily opponent but the 32 - year - old has struggled in recent times to match the level of consistency he once had when he was ranked as high as no 8 in the world			1
@entity0 hit a total of 37 winners throughout the match and sealed the win with a volley before showing his clear delight in celebration , pumping his first after picking up his first official victory of the year			2
@entity0 of @entity56 plays a backhand on his way to his first round victory over @entity21 @entity60 's @entity21 had no answer as @entity0 brushed him aside in straight sets @entity0 had cautiously downplayed his chances prior to the tournament but there is no doubt that he has the benefit of a kind draw from this point until a possible semi-final meeting with @entity71			1
however , the 14 - time @entity19 champion still feels he needs to shake off the rust after only playing nine tour matches since july due to a wrist injury and appendix surgery			0
@entity0 said : ' you can practice a lot			2
i practised i think enough and with the right attitude , but at the end what you need is matches			0
you practice very well , but you do n't have matches under your shoulders			0
' you can not play with the right confidence , with the right competitive spirit , because you need to feel that			0
all the practices , you do n't get that			0
the only way to get that is having matches			0
' that 's why this victory today is very important , and every time that i am on court competing is a big help for me to try to be back on the right level that i want to be			0
' next up for @entity0 in the second round is @entity104 world no 112 @entity105 , who beat @entity106 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 .			1
