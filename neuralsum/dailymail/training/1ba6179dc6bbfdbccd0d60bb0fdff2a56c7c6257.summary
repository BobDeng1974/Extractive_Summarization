vital help for elderly people will be restricted to only those who need help with two tasks or more , the @entity0 said last night			1
councils have been told to provide home helps and other assistance only if people are unable to complete two or more essential daily tasks			2
if they are unable to do only one of the 10 appointed tasks they should receive no help from their council – meaning they would have to pay for care themselves or do without it			1
criteria : new rules say elderly people will need two or more ' care needs ' before qualifying for assistance charities said as many as 340,000 who need help would fail to get it under the new rules			1
@entity28 , of @entity29 , said the future looked ‘ bleak ’ for older people			1
‘ every day there is another horror story of an older person failed by the system and sadly things will not improve until the social care funding gap is filled ' , she said			1
' politicians in every party need to recognise this and commit to action as an urgent priority			0
’ the ten activities listed are : managing and maintaining nutrition , maintaining personal hygiene , managing toilet needs , being appropriately clothed , being able to make use of their home safely , maintaining a habitable home environment , maintaining family or other personal relationships , accessing work , using public transport , and looking after a child			0
under the present system , most councils restrict care to those with ‘ substantial ’ or ‘ critical ’ needs – meaning they are at risk of ending up in hospital without care			1
the @entity73 ’s new ‘ national eligibility criteria ’ – a minimum threshold of care that councils have to provide – says the elderly should get care if their needs arise from a physical or mental impairment , if they are unable to achieve two or more activities , and if this failure is likely to have a ‘ significant impact on wellbeing ’			1
warning : while many receive excellent care , charities said ' horror stories ' would continue ( posed by models ) @entity82 , chairman of the @entity83 , said : ‘ the @entity84 will only live up to its promise of a genuinely preventative system that promotes wellbeing , if the government re-thinks its plans to exclude so many older and disabled people from the system			1
‘ setting a high threshold for the care system is a bit like going to the doctor with a chest infection and being told to come back with pneumonia			1
‘ every day , our 76 organisations hear horror stories of older and disabled people who struggle to get the support they need to simply get up , get dressed and get out of the house			0
1 managing and maintaining nutrition 2 maintaining personal hygiene 3 managing toilet needs 4 being appropriately clothed 5 being able to make use of their house safely 6 maintaining a habitable home environment 7 developing and maintaining family or other personal relationships 8 accessing and engaging in work , training , education or volunteering 9 making use of necessary facilities or services in the local community including public transport , and recreational facilities or services 10 carrying out any caring responsibilities the adult has for a child ‘ the only long - term solution to the care crisis is an increase in funding , and – as the @entity129 experts rightly argue – as a country we can afford it			2
in fact we ca n’t afford not to			0
’ @entity137 - @entity136 , from the @entity138 , said : ‘ people were expecting a better deal from the @entity73 after all the promises			0
many older people and their families will be very angry and disappointed about this			0
‘ this is n’t about improving services and looking after people who desperately need support			0
‘ the whole thing is a con			0
the @entity73 said they were going to fix social care but they ’re making things worse			2
they ’re cutting money from social care , so they ’re restricting eligibility			2
’ a @entity158 spokesman said the new rules were designed to be the same as the ‘ substantial ’ threshold			1
‘ helping people to live independently and prevent them from becoming ill is what people want and is a better use of our resources , ’ she said			0
‘ the @entity84 and our £ 3.8billion @entity168 will focus on keeping people well , which can save money and prevent people needing more support			0
' we are clear that people , whatever their level of need , will receive help from their council to get support and information			0
’ she added officials had asked the @entity83 and @entity183 to come up with examples of people who only had one care need – and they could not come up with one .			2
