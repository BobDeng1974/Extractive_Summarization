mrs @entity26 said : ' it 's a nightmare			2
me and my daughter lie at the back and my husband and son sleep in the front of the car			2
@entity18 says the family does not meet criteria for a council house despite them sleeping in a car ' i ca n't remember the last time i had a good night 's sleep			1
we 're constantly bickering at each other			0
' the former carer and mother - of - four says she has a shower at her other daughter @entity63 's house and is picked up by her husband when he finishes work at around 1am			0
for the last decade mr @entity9 ( pictured right with his wife ) has lived in his minicab - but has no proof of residence she says the situation has taken its toll on their close - knit family , particularly her youngest daughter @entity7			1
she said : ' my husband 's quite used to it as he 's done it for the past 10 years or so but my son and daughter are getting really stressed			1
' they 're 21 and 20 but they act quite young for their age			0
' my youngest took an overdose of prescription pills about three months ago and she 's now waiting to go to counselling			0
' mrs @entity26 , who suffers from depression , says she ca n't work at the moment due to lack of sleep and not having a proper home			1

@entity14 , 21 , is training to become a hairdresser at the @entity98 in @entity99 and takes home £ 50 a week			0
the family lived together in @entity35 before the house was repossessed because they could n't afford to pay the mortgage after mr @entity9 was made redundant from his job at a magazine company in central @entity106			1
around six months later she moved to @entity107 where she lived until the summer of last year before getting back together with her husband			0
@entity18 said : ' the family is comprised of a husband , wife and two children aged 20 and 21 , both of whom are working			1
' the family approached the service in april this year and were advised that they should look to find private rented accommodation as they are unlikely to be classed as in priority need in light of the children being adults and both working			0
' the council has made a commitment to prioritise established @entity127 families in their allocations policy , which means having lived continuously in the borough for two years at the point of application			0
the couple got back together last year but the family have been sleeping in the car ever since ' as this is not the case with this family it is not possible to accept a housing application from them at this stage			2
' social housing is in short supply and the @entity18 must look at the evidence of each case very closely as things are not always as they seem			0
it is the @entity18 's duty to ensure that it gets value for money for its taxpayers and that those with the most need are prioritised			0
' in spite of the council 's comment , the @entity9 family say @entity7 is not in work .			2
