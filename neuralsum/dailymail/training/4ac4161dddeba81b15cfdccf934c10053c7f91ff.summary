by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 6 november 2012 biggest in @entity1 : the proposed brothel in @entity3 will ' cater ' for 1,000 guests every day , with 150 prostitutes on call around the clock an @entity10 businessman has unveiled plans to open @entity1 's largest brothel - complete with a round the clock supply of 150 sex workers and even parking space for coaches			1
the Â£ 12m project , known as the ' @entity19 ' , will be located near the capital @entity3 and have capacity for 1,000 ' guests ' a day across 147 rooms			1
it will be surrounded by a three - metre high fence to ensure privacy and offers traditional hotel features such as restaurants , gym and beauty facilities as well as sex services including ' swinger parties , gang bangs and porn stars			1
' the precise location of the new mega-brothel , expected to open its doors - or is that curtains - in 2014 remains a secret so as not to alarm local residents			1
the developers , @entity3 - based @entity42 , say the ' number of females ' and the ' affordable prices ' will ' ensure absolute satisfaction for male customers			2
' @entity48 , the businessman behind the project , said the ' four - star facilities ' will be the sex industry 's shift from ' grocer to supermarket			1
' he told the @entity10 newspaper @entity56 : ' we 've deliberately spread false information about the location to avoid trouble before we had the authorisation to go ahead			0
' but it will be situated in a location that does n't bother anyone			0
' all that is known is that the ' @entity19 ' will be located somewhere in @entity66 , the state which surrounds the capital			2
new @entity3 regulations requiring brothels to have official licences have meant locating the brothel in the city centre is impractical			2
local authorities and the police have already given their consent to the project			0
prostitution in @entity66 is both legal and regulated			0
red light : the brothel , which will be called the ' @entity19 ' already has the support of @entity3 police and local authorities ( file photo ) there has been a mixed response to the news			1
@entity87 , councillor for women 's issues on @entity3 's city council , said moving prostitution indoors ' was a priority because off the streets work is safe work			0
' however , @entity96 spokeswoman @entity95 said ' the women and their problems dissolve into thin air because they are no longer seen			0

four - star hotel and brothel complex will be located just outside @entity3 and combine sex services with traditional hotel facilities like a gym and beauty salon
the ' @entity19 ' has been *approved* already by local police and authorities , and is expected to open in 2014
