watch scroll down for ' @entity22 on his club 's ownership and potential stadium move ' moving : @entity2 have revealed it 's ' highly unlikely ' they will move into their new stadium in 2017 @entity28 capacity : 60,000			1
distance from @entity4 : 4.95 miles			2
likelihood : it fits the bill , but @entity2 ’ rivals @entity34 , who will move into the stadium in 2016 , would oppose the idea			1
distance from @entity4 : 40.05 miles			0
likelihood : the capacity is n’t much smaller than the 36,240 - seat @entity4 , but the distance between the grounds is even greater than that travelled by @entity46 fans to see their team play in @entity48 last season			1
and that went down very badly			0
on wednesday the @entity49 confirmed the stadium has already held 33 events this year — including @entity53 internationals , @entity55 semi-finals and the final , play - off finals , the @entity58 final and various others sporting events and concerts			0
spurs need a stadium that can host a minimum of 19 home games in the @entity66 and would also need it for the @entity55 , @entity58 and the possibility of @entity69 football			0
the old @entity0 was used as a temporary solution for @entity71 in the @entity72 between 1998 and 2000 because @entity74 ’s capacity was severely restricted for @entity69 nights			0
spurs , who are still wrangling with a local business over the final piece of land on the stadium site before work can start at @entity4 , have explored the possibility of a temporary home at @entity0			1
controversial : spurs will have to play away from @entity4 for one season it may be hard to swallow for @entity2 and @entity34 fans , but their teams wo n't be the first to find reasonable success with ground sharing			1
@entity92 and @entity93 : the west @entity13 clubs shared @entity95 for two season between 2002 and 2004 while @entity97 was being redeveloped			2
@entity98 / @entity100 / @entity99 : @entity98 shared @entity101 with @entity100 between 1985 and 1991 before playing hosts to @entity99 until their extinction in 2003 @entity104 and @entity105 : both called the @entity108 home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two @entity104 teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them			0
the stadium would be an easy sell to fans because it is a neutral venue and is located just 13 miles west of their current home			0
a stadium share with @entity71 would be the most logical alternative but this has been ruled out because of the animosity that exists between supporters			0
@entity38 , which is nearly 50 miles from @entity4 , is also under consideration			1
@entity2 officials were impressed with the 32,000 - capacity stadium during a visit to @entity131 for their @entity58 victory over @entity133 last month			2
@entity2 chairman @entity134 has secured a compulsory purchase order on the land surrounding @entity4 , but the last remaining tenant has been given leave to appeal to the @entity139			1
@entity140 , which is run by the @entity142 family , are refusing to leave until they are given adequate compensation for the inconvenience of relocating			0

options : @entity155 ' @entity38 has emerged as a likely temporary home for @entity2 they have been in discussions with @entity2 for seven years , but can not reach an agreement with the club			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ the club has revised its construction programme in order to take the shortest possible time to construct			1
‘ this now therefore involves the club moving away from the @entity4 during construction for a period of one season , to start at the beginning of a season in order to comply with @entity66 rules			1
we are currently undertaking due diligence on alternative stadium options			0
’ @entity4 was originally built in 1898 and @entity2 moved into their home a year later , but @entity134 has always dreamed of building one of the best stadiums in @entity181 in the area			2
the current capacity is 36,240 , but the @entity2 chairman is convinced they need a bigger stadium to generate more income and enable them to compete with the top clubs in @entity181			2
@entity2 previously bid to move to the @entity28 in @entity189 , but lost out to @entity34 in 2011 .			2
