this kitten 's life was saved by half a litre of vodka after yobs doused her with anti-freeze			1
@entity7 came home after the incident last week soaking wet and was seriously ill by the next morning			1
her owners @entity11 , 47 , and daughter @entity12 , 27 , took the four - month - old to the vets and were shocked when they were told that vodka would help break down the poison			1
the unusual treatment was administered via a drip and @entity7 was understandably pretty drunk after getting through half a litre of 39 % vodka over the course of two days			1
@entity12 said : ' when we heard about the treatment i was just shocked			1
i had no idea you could even give an animal vodka			2
' @entity7 was totally blind drunk after being fed the vodka on a drip			1
@entity7 's owner @entity12 , 27 , said the kitten was ' blind drunk ' after being given vodka to counteract the anti-freeze yobs had doused her in ' she was trying to get up and she just toppled over			1
her eyes were out of focus and when we took her home in a carry basket , her mouth has pressed up against the wire so it looked as though she had her teeth bared			2
' at one point she was lying down trying to swipe at a pen and she just kept missing it , she was that out of it			0
it was all just totally mad			0
' @entity7 was treated first at @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , and then taken to vets now in @entity52 , where her condition was monitored round the clock by staff			1
@entity56 , a vet at @entity48 , explained it is the ethanol in the spirit which neutralises the anti-freeze			1
he said : ' the vodka treatment is quite unusual but is commonly used on animals who have swallowed anti-freeze			0
the animals are fed the vodka through a drip and they do get quite drunk			2
' it is the ethanol used in this particular spirit which helps			2
the four - month - old kitten came home soaking wet and was given half a litre of 39 % vodka over two days ' anti-freeze is extremely toxic to animal 's kidneys , and we specifically use vodka because the ethanol in it neutralises the substance in the poison			1
' anti-freeze is life - threatening			1
sadly , not all animals we have seen who have swallowed the substance make it , but if seen quickly and if they are given the vodka to react to the anti-freeze , they have a good chance of surviving			0
' the kitten is now back at her home in @entity49 and being looked after by @entity12			1
she added : ' the change in her is amazing			0
she seems to be doing ok , although it is absolutely heartbreaking that someone could do this to an innocent little animal			0
' i do not understand why anyone would go out of their way to harm @entity7			2
she 's just a baby really , and has such a lovely temperament			0
you should be able to let your own cat out and not have to worry about this happening			0
' @entity7 left her house at 10pm last tuesday but when she returned she appeared unwell and was soaking wet			1
at first , @entity11 and @entity12 thought the liquid was water but by the next morning , they realised there was something seriously wrong and took her to the vets			1
and this is not the first time that the family 's cats have been attacked			0
just five weeks ago , four - year - old @entity115 was covered in tar and was left with a snare wrapped tightly around her neck			0
@entity12 said : ' she was almost screaming at the window to be let in , and when she was she was covered in tar and had a snare around her neck			2
' she had no claws from where she had obviously tried to stop herself from being dragged away by the person who attacked her			0
' i want whoever is responsible to be caught and brought to justice			0
' after this happened i tried to keep @entity7 indoors , but she somehow managed to get out			2
' another of the family 's cats , @entity133 , died after eating food laced with caustic soda four years ago			0
anyone who has any information about the attacks is asked to contact @entity139 on 101 .			0
