when pensioner @entity1 decided to clear the brambles from a footpath at the bottom of his garden , he was only trying to help			1
many of his neighbours stopped by to thank the former police officer for all his work – which saw him replace a dilapidated fence and build a seat for weary walkers			1
but not everyone was so delighted by the grandfather ’s efforts			0
soon @entity17 , the charity which owns the footpath , announced that they had health and safety concerns over his homemade bench			1
good deed : @entity1 and his dog @entity26 in front of the path he painstakingly cleared in @entity29 following a complaint from the charity , mr @entity1 , 65 , was called in to be questioned at his local police station in @entity33 , @entity29			1
he has now been told that he could be charged with the theft of the old fence			1
last night mr @entity1 said : ‘ i am worried sick that what i believed was a good deed for everyone in the village is going to end up with me having a criminal conviction			1
‘ i have nothing to hide , i admit i did it			0
but never did i imagine anyone would be anything but happy			0
i ’m finding it hard to sleep at night and am worried about the future			0
’ mr @entity1 – who lives with his wife @entity47 – has six children as well as two young grandchildren			1
he says he had already asked @entity17 to replace the broken - down fence			2
but he finally decided to take matters into his own hands after his dog @entity26 became impaled on one of its rusty spikes			2
he said : ‘ @entity26 did n’t see the spike , which had become buried by the overgrown vegetation , but it punctured her skull and it is only thanks to the skill of a clever vet that she survived			0
‘ but it was n’t only the fence that @entity17 had neglected and allowed to fall into disrepair – the footpath was a jungle of dangerous brambles that snagged horse riders , walkers and cyclists			1
’ when mr @entity1 spotted a couple of volunteers from @entity17 , he mentioned his plans to replace the fence			1
‘ they seemed pleased that i was offering to sort it out , so i ploughed on ’ , he said			0
labour of love : mr @entity1 and @entity26 with his homemade bench built for weary walkers after cutting down the brambles at the bottom of his garden , mr @entity1 removed what remained of the old fence and sold it for scrap to help pay for new wooden posts			1
meanwhile he got on with the back - breaking task of clearing away the brambles and started to fashion a homemade bench			0
‘ it took me the last month to clear it , ’ he said , ‘ but it was worth it to see people being able to use that path properly for a change			2
when a few people stopped me outside my house and said what a good job i ’d done , i felt really proud			0
’ neighbour @entity109 , 60 , said : ‘ everyone believes @entity1 has enhanced the footpath			1
it used to be an eyesore but now it looks lovely			0
we are all upset at the way he ’s been treated and horrified he could be prosecuted			0
’ @entity17 spokesman @entity117 said : ‘ @entity118 and safety is really important to us and we ask that people talk to us before doing anything on our land to avoid any risk to the public			2
we are waiting to hear whether the police wish to press charges			2
’ last night a police spokesman said : ‘ @entity128 are investigating allegations received from another party in relation to property being removed			0
‘ whilst this investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment .			0
