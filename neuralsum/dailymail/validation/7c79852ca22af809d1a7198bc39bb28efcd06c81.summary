a dolphin who was found dead in a river was shot with a shotgun , an autopsy has revealed			1
the body of the female adult bottlenose , named @entity7 , was discovered in the @entity8 , north of @entity9 before @entity10 last year , but was only examined this month by scientists			1
@entity13 senior research scientist @entity12 said four shotgun pellets were found in the dolphin 's body after she was found in the @entity18 area			1
' it appears @entity7 did not die immediately after she was shot , ' ms @entity12 told @entity20			2
one of the four shotgun pellets was found on the deceased body of female adult bottlenose named @entity7 @entity7 pictured a decade ago when she was first sighted in 1992 by a @entity24 and @entity25 group ' she was emaciated , and there were signs of disease that may have been related to the shotgun pellets entering her body			1
' we believe she died within weeks or even months			2
the shooting was n't a primary cause of death but it was a secondary - something else followed after she was shot			0
' dr @entity36 said there had been about 10 dolphins discovered dead after being shot in @entity9 waters since 1998 , despite all mammals are protected by law			1
' we 're more annoyed and concerned than sad , ' ms @entity12 said			0
' it 's distressing to think someone would injure one and we do n't know why they 're doing it - either intentionally or accidentally but it 's animal cruelty because it 's not really a nice thing to do			2
' it 's an illegal act			2
we 're more concerned and we want to make sure people are obeying the law			0
' i also understand that the local people have not been happy with it either so i suspect someone will make a report soon if they see anything suspicious			0
' @entity13 senior research scientist @entity12 ( right ) dissecting another dolphin ms @entity12 said it was animal cruelty for a dolphin to be shot with a gun whale and @entity64 dr @entity62 first sighted @entity7 in 1992 and had since followed her movements and monitored her behaviour ever since			1
' it is clear that despite the implementation of the @entity70 in the area , these dolphins are still under threat , ' he told @entity20			0
' it is important that more resources are put into the sanctuary to improve its effectiveness			0
' dr @entity62 said when he first identified graze , she had suffered a major wound across the top of her back but fortunately , she survived and went on to have a number of calves			2
but this was not the first time a dolphin was killed by a shotgun in the local waters			1
two dolphins were killed in the @entity18 in 1998 and the calf of one of these died shortly afterwards			0
the @entity13 has subsequently found shot gun pellets in dolphins collected in the @entity9 area on a number of occasions but the bodies were found just outside the sanctuary boundaries			1
anyone who kills or wilfully injures a dolphin ( stock image ) could face up to $ 100,000 or two years in prison the @entity13 government introduced the sanctuary in 2005 to protect @entity9 's resident bottlenose dolphins , and introduced heavy fines for those who attack the animals			1
in @entity109 , the maximum penalty for anyone who kills or wilfully injures a protected marine mammal could face a hefty fine of up to $ 100,000 , or two years imprisonment			0
@entity70 manager @entity115 told @entity20 these fines are issued under the @entity116 1972			0
' we would like to encourage anyone that may have information about the incident to contact us or the police , ' ms @entity115 said .			0
