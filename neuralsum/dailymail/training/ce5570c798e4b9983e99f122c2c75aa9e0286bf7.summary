@entity0 might have given his players a thumbs up at the end of another frenetic encounter , but it remains as much about crisis management as football management for the @entity8 at @entity9			2
he did his best to deny that at @entity11 yesterday , daring to suggest @entity12 received a red card for nothing more than ‘ a professional foul ’ and refusing to respond to the idea that it might have been a mistake to make him captain			1
it was neither a good question , nor a good analysis of @entity12 ’s challenge on @entity22 , the @entity8 said			1
even if @entity22 was deep in his own half , and 70 yards from @entity9 ’s goal , when @entity12 decided to plant his right foot in the @entity28 midfielder ’s thigh			1
@entity9 's @entity12 takes down @entity22 of @entity28 and receives a red card @entity9 striker @entity12 , centre , is shown a red card by referee @entity32 @entity12 received a straight red after a foul on @entity22 of @entity28 @entity9 captain @entity12 walks off the pitch after receiving a red card for a foul on @entity22 @entity9 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity38 6 ; @entity39 6 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 6 ; blind 7 ; @entity44 7 ( @entity45 74 6 ) , @entity46 6 ( @entity47 90 6 ) ; @entity12 4 ; @entity48 7 , @entity49 6 ( @entity50 65 6 )			1
@entity28 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity51 5 ; @entity52 6 ( @entity53 65 6 ) , @entity54 6 , @entity55 5 , @entity56 6 ; song 5 , @entity58 6 , @entity59 6 ( @entity60 61 6 ) ; @entity22 6 : @entity61 7 , @entity45 6			1
booked : @entity57 , @entity61			0
‘ @entity66 ’ was how many saw it , but not @entity65			0
no , like @entity12 , he somehow saw danger in @entity22 ’s run			1
he was taken down because he needed to be , @entity9 ’s manager essentially argued , with @entity12 ’s only mistake being the over-zealous nature of the tackle			1
more seasoned @entity12 watchers will have a different view of the sixth red card of his career			1
we have seen this before ; a senseless , seemingly unprovoked moment of madness that normally succeeds only in leaving a manager wondering if this hugely gifted footballer can be trusted			0
but even by @entity12 ’s standards this was extraordinary ; enough surely to alarm a watching @entity86 however blasé @entity65 might have claimed to be about it			0
in the end , in the isolated context of this game , it mattered not			0
the advantage @entity9 secured with first - half goals from @entity12 and @entity95 was enough to see off a spirited @entity28 side			1
@entity9 striker @entity12 opens the scoring in the fifth minute @entity9 's @entity12 , right , celebrates after scoring against @entity28 @entity98 miles @entity9 108.1 67.2 @entity99 90 11.8 7.3 @entity95 90 11.1 6.9 @entity100 89 10.6 6.6 @entity28 108.6 67.5 @entity22 90 10.9 6.8 @entity101 90 10.8 6.7 @entity57 90 10.7 6.6 but @entity65 must now prepare for three games , one at home against @entity105 and another against league leaders @entity107 at @entity11 , without his captain at a time when leadership on the pitch is almost as important as the guidance he continues to provide off it			1
it was already proving another uncomfortable spectacle for @entity65 as his side swung almost as violently between rapidly executed attacks and anxiety attacks at the opposite end of the field			0
but attacks of a purely physical nature are the last thing he needs , when @entity12 is so central a figure in a team still struggling to overcome the imbalance created by a brilliant forward line and an inexperienced defence			0
in fairness to those charged with the task of defending @entity9 ’s goal yesterday , they actually did rather well in the end			0
they were aided by the poor quality of @entity28 ’s finishing , but it was an improvement on last sunday ’s debacle at @entity141			0
@entity40 , a 19 - year - old from @entity142 , impressed on his debut in a back four boasting another debutant in @entity42 as well as a centre - half — @entity41 — making only his third appearance for the club			1
if anything , @entity40 looked more assured than the more experienced @entity149 and was responsible for a marvellous headed clearance late in the second half			2
going forward , of course , @entity9 remain excellent , with @entity12 outstanding at times in this game			2
it actually made his clash with @entity22 all the more bizarre			0
he should have been celebrating the 10th anniversary of his @entity9 debut with a fine performance as well as a goal that lifts him to third in the all - time list for the @entity161			1
@entity9 started , much as they did at @entity141 last week , with what amounted to a commanding attacking display that simply proved too much for their opponents			0
the move that led to @entity12 's goal vs @entity28 - click here for more stats in matchzone @entity9 striker @entity95 , centre left , scores second goal against @entity28 @entity9 's @entity95 celebrates after scoring against @entity28 they were ahead after only five minutes , @entity12 meeting a bouncing cross from @entity39 with a marvellous first - time strike that curled beyond the reach of keeper @entity51			1
no sooner had @entity9 ’s captain settled the nerves at @entity11 , however , than a defensive error very nearly led to an equaliser for the visitors			0
a poorly directed backpass from an otherwise impressive @entity99 suddenly invited @entity185 to strike , but the @entity28 forward blasted over			2
it was a combination of defensive errors that then enabled @entity48 to double @entity9 ’s lead in the 22nd minute			2
a poor clearance from @entity51 was compounded when @entity57 lost possession to @entity44			0
he passed to @entity49 , who in turn found @entity48 with a superb pass			0
even then , though , @entity55 was too hesitant in challenging @entity48 and the @entity8 beat @entity51 with a delightful right - foot strike			1
@entity28 striker @entity61 ( centre ) pulls a goal back with a close - range header @entity28 's @entity197 had the ball in the net but the effort was ruled out for offside defender @entity42 made his first start for @entity9 since his £ 30m summer move from @entity203 @entity9 manager @entity0 gives a thumbs up to the fans after a much - needed victory at @entity11 @entity207 impressed on his @entity9 debut and actually looked more assured than @entity41 @entity149 midfielder @entity100 was again at the heart of @entity9 's attacking prowess defender @entity47 also made his debut against @entity28 on saturday @entity9 's assistant manager @entity212 ( left ) talks to referee @entity32 after the final whistle @entity100 really should have made it 3 - 0 but sent an effort wide and the mistake was made to feel all the more costly when @entity61 seized on the mess @entity9 made of defending a @entity22 corner in the 37th minute			1
@entity219 was most at fault for flapping ineffectively at the ball under pressure from @entity59 , and after @entity45 saw his initial header bounce off the @entity224 was there to pounce with a more accurate effort			2
@entity227 made amends when he denied @entity61 after the break , and in the end credit should be given to a makeshift defence that just about protected that one - goal margin			2
but @entity65 will also know @entity234 ’s side were not as impressive as they had been against @entity235 the previous week			0
@entity28 ’s manager was also bitterly disappointed with his side ’s failure to take advantage of @entity12 ’s red card			1
afterwards @entity234 also blamed the match officials for ruling that @entity197 was offside when he converted @entity53 ’s cross from close range with little more than a minute remaining			2
it was certainly a close call from the officials which , on another day , could have gone in the visitors ’ favour			0
to be fair to @entity234 , his argument was nothing like as bizarre as his opposite number ’s .			0

@entity12 received a straight red card after he lashed out at @entity28 midfielder @entity22
@entity12 had put @entity9 ahead with marvellous first - time strike that curled beyond the reach of @entity51
@entity95 added a second in the 23rd minute with a delightful strike
@entity9 keeper @entity219 was most at fault when @entity61 pounced to give the @entity28 a *lifline*
@entity197 thought he had equalised in the last minute but his effort was ruled out for offside
@entity207 impressed on his debut and looked more assured than @entity41
