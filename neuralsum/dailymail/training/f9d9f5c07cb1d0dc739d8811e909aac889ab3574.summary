he was reported missing by his mother on april 11 after he failed to show up for work - but no trace of him was found despite public appeals and searches by mountain rescue teams			2
he was found at around noon on may 31 by @entity66 and his two children who spotted his body in shallow water within the ravine which had steep sided overgrown gullies			0
in mr @entity0 's rucksack , there was found to be medication from 2011 thought to have been for leg pain , a receipt for energy bars purchased on april 5 , a wallet and an empty bread wrapper			1

mr @entity0 's mother @entity100 said : ' he did n't always take his camera but often if he found any tracks he would go back and get his camera			1
' but she said she used to ' tell him off ' for not having a mobile phone despite his many walks over the moors			0
she added that he had complained of feeling dizzy three weeks before he went missing on april 5			0

coroner @entity146 , concluding an open verdict , said : ' i know he was somebody that very much enjoyed watching wildlife and nature			1
' we heard that going up towards the waterfall was quite spectacular			0
his rucksack was found on a branch on a tree that gives rise to the possibility that he fell from that tree			2
' it is equally possibly having put his rucksack safe he may have been walking along the stream intending to make towards the waterfall			0
it 's possible he fell , that he slipped , that he collapsed			0
' the post mortem does not give any clues , there 's no evidence he intended to cause himself any harm			0
' in fact evidence is that he was looking forward			0
