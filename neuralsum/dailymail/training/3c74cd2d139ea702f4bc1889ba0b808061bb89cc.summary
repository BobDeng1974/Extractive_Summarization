by @entity0 from the air , it looks little different from any other exclusive development in one of @entity6 ’s most affluent areas			0
set in tranquil surroundings , the upmarket crescent of multi-million pound houses in @entity9 overlooks an historic swathe of private parkland			1
little wonder that couples with the means to pay up to £ 3.5million for a newly built mansion were keen to put their deposits down when they came up for sale			0
' @entity19 ' : how the six houses in upmarket @entity21 in @entity9 could be sealed off from neighbouring homes			1
the identities of the new buyers are protected by a confidentiality contract ' stockade ' : this picture shows one of the large new fences which have been installed			1
the smaller fence in front had planning permission , the larger currently does not barricade : this tall fence seals off one of the houses - and does not have planning permission exclusive : the six houses bought by the mystery buyers cost up to £ 3.5million each but shortly before contracts could be exchanged , mystery @entity40 buyers were allowed to gazump the would - be owners by buying four of the houses for cash			1
then they bought another two neighbouring ones – and began to corral them all with fencing and barbed wire			1
now neighbours in @entity21 , in the grounds of a mansion formerly used as a technical research base for the @entity53 , fear they will be living next to a high security ‘ stockade ’ created by the @entity58 royal family said to be behind the purchase			1
or , as one described it , a ‘ @entity19 ’ in the heart of leafy @entity9			2
yesterday residents were embroiled in a fractious stalemate with the newcomers , whom they accused of ‘ riding roughshod ’ over planning laws and community spirit			2
difference : the fence is considerably larger than what was allowed before @entity73 issue : parts of the fence have been topped with barbed wire contacted by the @entity77 , an intermediary for the buyers described the complainants as ‘ uncivilised people ’			1
@entity6 - based @entity82 admitted planning permission for the fencing had been sought only retrospectively , but added : ‘ when i get it they will regret that they have confused matters			0
’ seven luxury houses forming a crescent called @entity91 were sold by development firm @entity92			0
objection : @entity94 , pictured , is a local president who objects to the plan to erect a stockade around the houses all were five - bedroom ‘ mini palaces ’ bedecked with marble and high - quality fittings			2
@entity92 was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement when the new cash buyers stepped in			1
although the homes were officially sold to a @entity106 - registered firm , @entity105 , it is believed @entity105 was acting on behalf of four members of a @entity109 royal family			2
so why might fabulously rich @entity40 , whose normal playgrounds are multi-million pound homes in @entity112 , wish to set up camp in an already well - established community in @entity9 ? the answer might be that it ’s the perfect place from which to visit the @entity116 once a year at nearby @entity117			1
included in the sale at the 11th hour was a road the new owners want to seal off , effectively turning the site into a @entity109 - style compound			0
none of this was in the minds of three couples who paid £ 10,000 each to reserve three of the four homes in question			0
just before contracts were to be exchanged , they were told all four had been sold			0
octagon chief executive @entity131 refused to discuss the purchase			0
but one ‘ gazumpee ’ said : ‘ it all stank a little bit – that somebody pitches up with a bag of cash from the @entity109 and it becomes a confidential thing , and everybody sucks up to them			0
’ @entity94 , secretary of adjoining @entity144 residents ’ association , said : ‘ we fear this is actually the start of something rather worrying			0

six houses in exclusive @entity21 , @entity9 bought up by mystery buyers - gazumping *prospective* owners
the newcomers are thought to be @entity40 with royal connections - but are protected by confidentiality agreement
they are locked in stalemate with locals after they began building huge fences with barbed wire around houses
