just one month after @entity1 unveiled the ability to translate conversations between @entity4 and @entity5 in real time , @entity0 has announced its own voice translation service			1
the mobile translation app will automatically recognise speech in a number of widely - spoken languages to translate it into text in a user ’s native language			1
the move builds on @entity0 's translate feature , which offers written translation of 90 languages as well as enabling people to hear spoken translations in a handful of languages			1
@entity0 is tipped to extend its @entity25 app ( logo pictured ) by adding a feature that automatically recognises speech in a number of popular languages and translates conversation into text in a user 's native language , potentially making awkward mis - communication problems on holiday , a thing of the past the @entity39 app will let people converse in different languages , offering a running commentary on what is being said on the screen of a smartphone or computer , the @entity37 reported			1
when the update will be rolled out and how the technology works is unknown , but @entity49 has contacted @entity0 for comment			0
@entity0 told the newspaper that its translate app has been installed 100 million times on @entity39 handsets and that most of these apps will get the speech update			1
@entity57 , the engineering director of @entity25 said : ‘ we have 500 million active users of @entity60 every month , across all our platforms			0
’ users of @entity0 's text translate service which works with 140 languages will be familiar with this screen , but the new app will let people converse in different languages by offering a running commentary on what is being said , instead of a quick translattion in a ' box ' rumours of the @entity0 update come a month after @entity74 released a preview of @entity76 ( shown )			1
it lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls			2
the software translates @entity4 or @entity5 into text and speech , using a @entity85 8.1 device @entity86 uses augmented reality to translate text including road signs , menus , newspapers , and more by pointing a phone ’s camera towards it			1
supported languages include @entity95 , @entity4 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
@entity0 bought the technology by acquiring @entity102 - based developers @entity103 in may last year			0
' with @entity86 , we 've seen the beginnings of what 's possible when we harness the power of mobile devices to ' see the world in your language , ' the firm said			0
' by joining @entity0 , we can incorporate @entity103 's technology into @entity25 's broad language coverage and translation capabilities in the future ' available on @entity117 , @entity39 and @entity118 , users choose the language they want to translate to and from , before holding a camera up to text , such as a road sign or menu			1
@entity86 automatically translates the text and overlays it on the same image on the phone 's display			2
he believes that because 80 to 90 per cent of the web is written in 10 languages , being able to interpret different languages is a critical learning tool for millions of people			2
@entity0 will also launch a freshly branded app that translates foreign text into a user ’s native language using a smartphone camera			2
the ability to do this already exists via an app called @entity86 , whose parent company , @entity103 , was acquired by @entity0 in may 2014			0
users can hover their smartphone camera in front of text – a street sign for example - to see a translation magically appear on their screen			0
last month , @entity74 's @entity1 released a beta version of its live translation tool , which translates speech instantly into both text and spoken translations			1
while it currently only interprets between @entity5 and @entity4 , it will eventually offer 40 languages , which will mean people from different countries will be able to converse with ease			1
‘ @entity1 is now removing another barrier to make it possible for people to communicate irrespective of what language they speak , ’ @entity74 ’s @entity160 wrote in a blog post			2
‘ @entity76 relies on machine learning , which means that the more the technology is used , the smarter it gets			0
’ initial reports from @entity1 's beta version ( shown ) say it is good , although not perfect			1
‘ for @entity76 to work properly , there is a little mental conditioning involved , ’ reported @entity171			0
they say you need to speak slowly , and now ' um ' or ' ah ' too much ‘ we are starting with @entity5 and @entity4 , and as more people use the @entity180 preview with these languages , the quality will continually improve			1
’ initial reports about @entity1 's beta version say it is good , but not perfect			1
‘ for @entity76 to work properly , there is a little mental conditioning involved , ’ reported @entity171			0
‘ for one , you must speak slowly			0
@entity76 's speech recognition is good , and plenty fast , but that accuracy decreases as you speed up in words per minute			0
‘ " hey , how is it going ? " can change to " hey is going ? " pretty quickly			0
’ it ’s also recommended that the speaker does n’t ‘ um ’ and ‘ ah ’ too much , as this can confuse the translation tool			2
a breakthrough by the @entity1 and @entity74 translator teams in neural network - based speech recognition reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent , meaning that it is more accurate than ever before			1
@entity0 will also launch a freshly branded app that translates foreign text into a user ’s native language using a smartphone camera			2
the ability to do this already exists via an app called @entity86 , in which users instantly see a translated sign , for example ( pictured ) , on the screen of their phone @entity74 first unveiled the technology ( shown ) two years ago			0
at the time , though , it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public			0
but a breakthrough by the @entity1 and @entity219 teams in neural network - based speech recognition reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent			2

@entity39 app will automatically recognise speech in a number of languages
real - time text translation will let people converse more naturally without understanding each other 's mother *tongues* , rumours *suggest*
will build on @entity0 's translate feature , which offers written translation of 90 languages and spoken translations in some cases
app follow 's beta version of @entity74 's @entity1 speech translation tool
it translates a video conversations between @entity5 and @entity4
