a slaughterhouse boss at the centre of the 2013 horsemeat scandal has been fined £ 8,000 after failing to provide paperwork for horse carcasses he sold			1
@entity6 admitted one count of failing to abide by @entity9 meat traceability regulations after being unable to back up claims he had sent nearly 40 carcasses to @entity14 restaurants			1
another 12 horses from his slaughterhouse in @entity17 in @entity18 were sold without any records ever being kept			1
the 65 - year - old claimed that rather than sell them on without knowledge of where they were going , many were purchased by caterers in the market for horsemeat			2
@entity6 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) have become the first people sentenced over the 2013 horsemeat scandal			1
the pair worked together at an abattoir in @entity18 where records of more than 50 carcasses were lost @entity6 and his slaughterhouse manager @entity28 were involved in the 2013 scandal which saw hundreds of people mistakenly sold the meat			1
they were both sentenced at @entity38 today , the first of anyone involved in the furore , with @entity28 given a four month prison sentence suspended for two years			0
the court heard how @entity6 did not produce adequate paperwork for 55 horse carcasses he had sold and accepted 17 animals into his abattoir without the appropriate documents			1
when questioned , he told officials that 37 had been sold to two @entity14 restaurants in @entity51 and @entity52			1
investigators could not verify his story , claiming neither of the establishments existed			0
' when inquiries were made of the relevant councils , nothing was found that confirmed the existence of businesses with those names , ' said prosecutor @entity62			0
the court heard how in 2013 , @entity64 requested paperwork for carcasses that passed through the slaughterhouse in 2012			1
at the time @entity28 admitted much of their business was done ' cash in hand ' and without a detailed paper trail			0
days later he forged an invoice requested as a result of the meeting			0
@entity38 heard how the 65 - year - old claimed almost 40 of the carcasses were sold to @entity14 restaurants but this was never verified while investigators could not tell exactly when and where the animals had been slaughtered , mr @entity62 said there would have been no cause for dishonesty if they had worked to the rules			1
@entity6 was fined £ 8,000 for breaching @entity9 rules on the traceability of food			1
general @entity90 states that ' food and feed business operators shall have in place systems and procedures to identify the other businesses to which their products have been supplied '			0
however , @entity6 could not back up claims he had sent 40 horse carcasses to @entity14 restaurants			1
after admitting one charge of failing to abide by this traceability law , the maximum sentence @entity6 could have faced was a two - year sentence and an unlimited fine			1
' there would be no cause to cover up the provenance or destination of horsemeat unless there was something underlying wrong with that horsemeat , ' he said			0
' it ca n’t be said where they were slaughtered , when they were slaughtered , whether it was on site - but horsemeat passed through @entity6 ’s slaughterhouse without being properly documented			2
' he admitted while critics could point to the slaughterhouse for the supply of horsemeat involved in the scandal , doing so was purely ' speculation '			2
there was no proof to suggest either @entity6 or @entity28 tried to pass off horsemeat as anything else which was the basis for public outcry in 2013			1
sentencing judge @entity132 emphasised this , but noted the importance of properly documenting meat for health and safety reasons			0
@entity28 told investigators much of the slaughterhouse in @entity17 in @entity18 was done ' cash in hand ' ‘ accordingly i must sentence each of you not on the basis you were complicit in putting horse meat into the human food chain			1
‘ what i do however sentence you for in your case , @entity6 , is for the failure to keep proper records and , in your case @entity28 , for committing an act of forgery to frustrate the investigation			2
’ judge @entity132 added : ‘ there may be those who may say , " well why does this matter ? " ... well people do care and they care for good reason			0
‘ the traceability of food products , here meat , is of critical importance in relation to public health			0
‘ if meat causes ill health then it is important that those responsible for investigating the cause and trace it backwards and backwards and backwards to find where the problem lies and to prevent the problem escalating and those who keep poor records frustrate that very important public interest and interest which touches on public health and public safety			0
‘ it matters so because the pubic are entitled to be confident in that process to know that if something does go wrong , ’ he said			0
products by @entity187 were among those to have traces of horse found in them in january 2013 , it emerged @entity192 and other major retailers had been selling burgers which contained large proportions of horse			2
the contaminated meat was found to have come primarily from a factory in @entity199 , which apparently sourced its ' beef ' from @entity201			2
as well as @entity192 , @entity202 , the co-op , @entity204 and @entity205 scrabbled to repair their public image and withdraw tainted products from shelves			0
the scandal escalated in february when it was revealed that frozen - food firm @entity187 had produced beef lasagne which was almost entirely made up of horse meat			1
in response to traces of the animal being found across @entity216 , the @entity64 instructed 2,501 tests to be carried out in @entity218			2
twenty - nine positive results were found in seven products which had , by the time of testing , already been recalled			0
these included some @entity187 lasagne as well as some @entity205 lasagne and spaghetti bolognese - all made by the @entity229 food processing company in @entity230			0
some of the products were found to contain up to 100 % horsemeat .			0

@entity6 sold 55 horse carcasses without keeping record of the sales
abattoir boss from @entity18 claimed 37 were sold to @entity14 restaurants
but @entity64 investigators could not back up his claims
he was found *guilty* of failing to produce proper paperwork for carcasses
there is no proof to suggest @entity6 tried to pass off horsemeat as beef
it is *impossible* to know where meat ended up because rules were broken
he and a *colleague* are the first involved in 2013 scandal to be sentenced
