a local council has been criticised for banning an @entity2 food stall from a @entity4 event because it ' only wanted @entity6 food '			1
@entity9 - born stall - holder @entity7 , 27 , was asked by @entity10 if she wanted to run a stand at the celebration later this month			1
but when she asked to be counted in she was told her stall , @entity15 , would not be allowed because it is not ' @entity6 - themed '			1
' discriminatory ' : @entity7 received a letter from @entity10 telling her it would not accept her offer to run a food stall at a @entity4 event because it ' only wanted @entity6 food ' the council has now apologised after their response sparked a backlash from locals - who pointed out that chicken tikka masala is a @entity9 - made dish			1
ms @entity7 , of @entity26 , @entity27 , was one of many food stall - holders who applied to take part in the event planned for sunday , april 26			1
when her application was rejected , she was sent a response she has branded ' discriminatory '			0
it read : ' it has been decided that @entity4 will be @entity6 themed food only			2
' ms @entity7 said : ' when i received the email my initial reaction was ' am i reading this right ? '			2
i could n't believe it			0
' i consider myself to be @entity6 - i was born in this country			1
how far does it go ? can only @entity6 people attend the event ? u-turn : the council has since apologised for the letter and reversed their decision by inviting ms @entity7 to run a stand on the day ' it is the utter ignorance of it all that makes me most upset			1
why should i not be allowed to trade on @entity4 ? ' it is a day celebrated all over the world			0
the whole thing has been very upsetting			0
' questioning the wording of the letter , she added : ' in all respect , with @entity6 cuisine in modern day @entity6 what can we actually define to be @entity6 food ? ' to say that one food is @entity6 cuisine and another is n't , i beg to differ			1
to think @entity2 food itself plays a huge part in @entity6 day food , it seems silly not to have it there			2
' @entity71 is the nation 's favourite dish and @entity73 himself was born in @entity75			1
i just thought they can not be serious			0
' she added : ' @entity78 is one of the most multi-cultural towns in @entity81			0
for them to turn around and say they do n't want my food there because it is n't @entity6 enough is discriminatory			1
' miss @entity7 posted the council 's email on her @entity89 page , which was criticised by her followers and friends			2
street party : an image captured at last year 's @entity94 in @entity78			0
the annual festival takes place in @entity97 on sunday @entity98 said : ' i wonder if they 'll be checking passports and heritage on the day to make sure the crowd is positively @entity6			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity10 said the authority ' never intended to be racist '			0
@entity106 , deputy city clerk , said : ' @entity107 acknowledges that the email sent to ms @entity7 was poorly worded			0
@entity107 never intended to be racist			0
' the theme of the @entity4 event in 2015 was olde worlde traditional @entity6 with @entity112 and dragon fighting			2
' ms @entity7 has raised some very interesting points about modern @entity6 and the council will wish to reflect upon these issues when setting the theme for the @entity4 in 2016 and onwards			1
' the council is delighted to offer ms @entity7 an opportunity to trade at the @entity4 event as part of our apology to her			1
defence : a spokeswoman for @entity10 said the authority ' never intended to be racist ' ' the council is sorry for any offence caused and looks forward to seeing @entity15 trading in @entity78			0
' ms @entity7 has stated she will now reluctantly accept the council 's offer of the stall			2
she said : ' when they offered us a stall my first reaction was to say no because they did n't want us there to start with , but the people seem to really want us there so we will be there			0

but then @entity146 told her food was n't @entity6 enough for event
