the bargain beaches of @entity1 lead @entity2 and @entity3 are the best value winter sun escapes for @entity5 this year , according to a new survey			1
despite price swings for tourists in many countries , the @entity8 island province and @entity9 's ' @entity2 ' have remained steady over the past 12 months , according to the annual @entity14 survey			1
a basket of 10 items , including an evening meal for two , will cost just £ 40 in @entity1 this winter , a nine per cent drop due to the weak @entity8 rupiah , the study of long - haul destinations showed			1
in @entity3 , which has moved up to third from fifth place in the same survey last year , the same items cost just under £ 50			1
these figures are less than a third of the most expensive locations with the 10 items costing £ 161 in @entity56 , where prices have skyrocketed to make it the most expensive of the 34 destinations reviewed			1
@entity56 prices for the items have risen 64 per cent since last year while @entity62 ( £ 155 ) , @entity63 in @entity64 ( £ 133 ) and @entity65 in @entity66 ( £ 126 ) are also at the priciest end of the spectrum			1
@entity69 overlooks @entity71 beach in @entity2 , number two on the tourism affordability scale 1 @entity1 , @entity8 - £ 40 ( -9 % ) 2 @entity2 , @entity9 - £ 47 ( -6 % ) 3 @entity3 ( various ) - £ 50 ( -9 % ) 4 @entity74 , @entity75 - £ 51.33 ( -26 % ) 5 @entity76 , @entity77 - £ 54.90 ( +1 % ) 6 @entity78 , @entity79 - £ 56.19 ( -47 % ) 7 @entity80 , @entity81 - £ 65.23 ( 0 % ) 8 @entity82 , @entity83 - £ 65.98 ( -36 % ) 9 @entity84 ( various ) - £ 72.66 ( -24 % ) 10 @entity85 ( various ) - £ 71.68 ( -9 % ) @entity86 , @entity56 - £ 160.61 ( +64 % ) 2 @entity62 - £ 155.34 ( +29 % ) 3 @entity63 , @entity64 - £ 133 ( +10 % ) 4 @entity65 , @entity66 - £ 126 ( £ 48 % ) 5 @entity87 , @entity88 - £ 117.53 ( +48 % ) 6 @entity89 , @entity90 - £ 117.32 ( 0 % ) 7 @entity91 , @entity92 - £ 115.85 ( +35 % ) 8 @entity93 , @entity94 - £ 114.33 ( +18 % ) 9 @entity95 , @entity96 - £ 109.47 ( -12 % ) 10 @entity97 , @entity98 - £ 104.68 ( +17 % ) source : @entity100 and @entity101 ( september 2014 ) @entity3 has moved from fifth to third in the poll while a three - course meal for two with a bottle of wine was just £ 27 in @entity1 , it would set a couple back nearly £ 114 in @entity62 and more than £ 99 in @entity56			1
the survey , in conjunction with holiday company @entity109 , showed that in the last 12 months the long - haul destinations where the local currency has fallen most against the pound were @entity75 , @entity9 , @entity114 and @entity83			0
prices in resorts have fallen the most in @entity79 , followed by @entity83 , @entity75 , @entity84 and @entity117			0
but as well as the hike in costs in @entity56 , prices have gone up in a number of other resorts , with hefty increases in @entity88 ( up 48 per cent ) , @entity65 ( up 48 per cent ) and @entity124 ( up 39 per cent )			2
@entity125 of @entity14 said : ' it all adds up to a polarised picture for @entity5 holidaymakers			2
on the one hand there are great savings to be made in popular long haul resorts and tourists will be ' quids in '			0
' on the other , people who make the wrong destination choice could fall victim to much increased resort prices and find themselves out of pocket			0
' former best value destination @entity3 recorded a nine per cent fall in prices due to a drop in prices in local resort areas			2
the strength of the pound sees the introduction of four new entrants in the @entity148 top 10 , with @entity82 moving to eighth , @entity84 to ninth and @entity85 , the cheapest of six @entity151 islands surveyed at £ 72 , sneaking into the top 10			0
perhaps the bargain of the year is @entity78 in @entity79 , where tourist staples have almost halved since 2013 to be £ 56			0
@entity109 's @entity155 said there has been a significant rise in demand for destinations such as @entity3 , @entity84 and @entity160 , ' where sterling is strong and the cost of living is low '			0
' the biggest increase year - on year is for @entity83 as consumers are recognising that the country is now much better value than in recent years , ' @entity155 said			0
' rising prices in @entity124 , @entity88 and @entity56 have n't yet impacted on demand as we have great value packages for these destinations			2
' tourists and local fishermen merge in @entity3 , number three on the @entity14 survey			1

@entity1 holds its place on top of the @entity14 survey
the @entity8 island is the best value when it comes to tourists ' staples
it leads @entity2 and @entity3 as top value winter sun escapes
@entity56 is the most expensive when 10 common items ' prices are compared
