‘ i think it ’s a load of rubbish			0
’ @entity3 district includes a number of outlying villages as well as the towns of @entity3 and @entity69			2

’ left - wing firebrand @entity39 mp @entity38 ( pictured ) , whose nickname the ' @entity2 ' comes from his outspoken and belligerent manner the @entity70 said it does not give out statistics on where its members are based , because ‘ many bigoted people still see us as some form of threat ’			2
