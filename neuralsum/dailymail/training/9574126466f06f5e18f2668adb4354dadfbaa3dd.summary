by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 19:02 est , 14 january 2013 traditional religious freedoms are under assault from the ‘ intolerance of aggressive secularism ’ , a cabinet minister will warn today			0
communities secretary @entity6 will today attack court rulings against the right of @entity9 to wear crosses at work and legal action to prevent prayers before council meetings			1
he will insist that faith provides a ‘ clear moral compass ’ for society and declare that the @entity18 does ‘ do @entity21 ’ , unlike the last @entity20 government			1
warning : @entity6 will say religious freedoms are under assault from the ' intolerance of aggressive secularism ' mr @entity6 ’s comments come on the day of a crunch verdict from the @entity25 , which will rule whether four @entity9 were discriminated against at work – including two women who claim they were forced out of their jobs for wearing the cross			1
he is vowing to change @entity31 law to support the right of people to discreetly display a symbol of faith in their workplace if their case is rejected			1
addressing the think - tanks @entity31 future and @entity41 in @entity42 , mr @entity6 will say : ‘ @entity43 provides a clear moral compass and a call to action that benefits society as a whole			1
at a time when @entity9 are under attack for their beliefs in different parts of the world , i am proud of the freedom of belief that exists in @entity31			1
‘ but in recent years long - standing @entity31 liberties of freedom of religion have been undermined by the intolerance of aggressive secularism : taking people to task for wearing a cross or a rosary , beginning costly legal actions against council prayers – as if they had nothing better to do			2
symbol of faith : @entity6 is vowing to change @entity31 law to support the right of people to discreetly display a symbol of faith in their workplace ‘ we ’re committed to the right of @entity9 and people of all beliefs to follow their faith openly , wear religious symbols and pray in public			1
’ bishop @entity75 , the former bishop of @entity76 , said that it would be ‘ clear discrimination ’ to allow employers to ban the cross whilst letting those of other faiths wear symbols and clothing from their religions			2
he added that it would ‘ further accelerate the undermining of this country ’s @entity87 foundations by aggressive secularism and naive multi-culturalism ’			0
in his speech , mr @entity6 will also reiterate previous demands that all immigrants should learn @entity95 , saying it is ‘ incomprehensible ’ that no one speaks the language in one in 20 households			1
parents who do not ensure their children learn @entity95 are ‘ condemning them to a limited life ’ , he will say			1
he will attack the ‘ old statist policies ’ such as the decision to pay for translation ‘ instead of trusting people to learn the language ’			1
‘ people should be able to talk to and understand one and another in a nuanced way			2
the reality is you need @entity95 to succeed			1
we all miss out , our country is the poorer , if people ca n’t speak our language , if they are unable to participate or make an economic contribution			2
‘ @entity95 is the passport to prosperity the world over			1
from @entity119 through to @entity120 every striving parent is trying to get their kids to learn @entity95 , ’ he will add			1
@entity6 : not confident in estimates @entity125 yesterday explained why the government is refusing to publish official estimates of how many @entity128 and @entity129 will come to the @entity31 to seek work when restrictions are lifted at the end of the year			2
he confirmed that figures had been drawn up by civil servants but said he had little confidence his officials had come up with reliable numbers			0
the prime minister said the @entity18 wants to avoid mistakes made by @entity20 in 2004			0
then , there were confident predictions that only a few thousand @entity142 would come to @entity31 for work when they joined the @entity144			2
in the event , the number of @entity142 migrants turned out to be far higher – and the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals put huge pressure on housing and public services			0
some 21million @entity128 and 7million @entity129 will be free to travel to and work in @entity31 from the end of the year when transitional controls on @entity144 migrants expire			2
at the weekend , @entity6 revealed he had seen estimates of how many might come to the @entity31 but said he would not yet release them because he was not ‘ confident ’ that the figures were accurate			0
in an interview with @entity159 ’s today programme , mr @entity125 backed mr @entity6 ’s decision not to publish the estimates			0
he said civil service figures had proved unreliable in the past			0
he added : ‘ if you look at what the calculation was in the case of @entity142 , it was something like 14,000 – a ridiculously low number – and it turned out to be many , many times that			0
so we do n’t want to make that mistake again so it ’s right to take the time and get this right			0
’ but mr @entity125 said he did not believe as many @entity129 and @entity128 would come over as @entity142 did almost a decade ago			0
he added : ‘ the last government did n’t put in place any transitional controls – we told them to			0
‘ you can basically restrict the immigration for the first seven years and they failed to do that , and quite rightly we have had transitional controls in place with @entity128 and @entity129			0
’ a source close to mr @entity6 yesterday said : ‘ when we get the answers , we will make a judgment [ on the figures ]			0
