@entity0 has launched an outspoken attack on the @entity3 ’s failure to land a multi-million pound sponsorship deal			1
the renowned sports impressario responsible for transforming snooker , boxing and darts was an invited speaker to an @entity10 convention at @entity11			1
he took the opportunity to brand the culture of leadership in the @entity16 game ‘ lazy ’ and ‘ disgraceful ’			1
and he told @entity16 football to stop ‘ looking at its shoelaces ’ and ‘ wallowing in self pity ’ while reserving his strongest words for the league hierachy by insisting the failure to replace @entity21 as sponsors – whose deal ended in 2012 – was a sackable offence			1
@entity29 chairman @entity0 speaks at the 2014 @entity30 ‘ i look at @entity16 football and see a nation with its head down looking at its shoelaces ' , he said			1
‘ when i started off with the darts and snooker we were way down - but we believed in ourselves and had a bit of a passion			2
‘ sometimes organisations get into that mode of “ that ’s how it is ”			2
they are totally lazy and set in their ways			2
‘ the fact you ’ve got a @entity48 without a sponsor			1
do you know how long you ’d work for @entity0 if that was the case ? ‘ i wo n’t even tell you how long - because that ’s not a performance i ’m looking for			1
‘ you ’ve got to grow			0
you ’ve got to be positive			0
you ca n’t expect people to take you seriously if you do n’t take yourself seriously			0
if you live in everyone ’s shadow then you never come out of that shadow			0
‘ you need something dramatic like “ attendances are going great ... commercial is this ... @entity59 is sponsoring the @entity3 ”			0
the fact the league does n't have a sponsor says everything you need to know so you better get it right and if you do n’t then it does n't matter to me because i wo n’t be back to talk again			1
’ the @entity69 chairman said it was a disgrace that the @entity48 did not have a sponsor @entity0 would later comment : ‘ the fact the @entity73 has no sponsor is not good			1
put it this way , if you worked for me you ’d be sacked			0
’ the man who turned snooker into primetime television in the 1980s , @entity0 has also been a prominent figure on the boxing circuit for decades and has now transformed darts into a sport capable of filling @entity88 ’s 12,000 seat @entity86 arena			2
laughing off talk of sprinkling his magic on @entity16 football as a consultant , @entity0 added : ‘ i certainly wo n’t be up for the leadership			1
but you can take a horse to water and what i ’ve said is n’t rocket science			0
it ’s just common sense			0
‘ if they do n’t take on the wider picture then you ’re stuck with what you are			0
‘ listen , i ’ll carry on selling 11,000 for a night of darts at the @entity86 and your ( football ) attendances will be 1250 people or whatever			2
i ’m a visitor so i ’m cheating a bit but the world is changing and there are so many more opportunities that you might not be aware of			0
‘ how can a little company like mine turn over the same amount as the @entity3 ? and how can we make millions and millions of pounds of profit and you ’re doing your b * * * * * * * ? ’ the @entity118 replay between @entity119 and @entity120 attracted just 1,326 fans on tuesday			0

@entity0 spoke at the @entity10 *'s* *inaugural* convention at @entity11
@entity29 chairman said the fact the @entity48 was without a sponsor was ' disgraceful '
@entity0 said @entity16 football had to be proud of its self and not a *secret*
