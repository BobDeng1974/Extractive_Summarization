a double - wicket maiden in the final over from @entity2 saw @entity3 complete a one - run victory and a 3 - 0 series whitewash over @entity6 in a remarkable one - day international in @entity8			1
the visitors looked like they had blown it when , with @entity6 eight wickets down and needing 24 for victory , they failed to appeal a run - out by @entity15 , who dislodged the bails at the second attempt after failing with his first to dismiss @entity18			1
@entity3 , who made 231 for nine in their 50 overs , failed to appeal , feeling they had missed their chance			1
@entity3 celebrates after winning the third match of the one day series between @entity3 and @entity6 replays showed that @entity18 was in fact inches short and it looked like @entity6 would take advantage as they slowly chalked off the runs needed for the win			1
with just two runs needed from the final over , though , @entity2 - whose 76 with the bat had helped his side with the second odi - this time bowled @entity38 and sent down three dot balls at number 11 @entity41 before having the pace bowler caught off the final ball to complete a remarkable triumph			1
earlier in the day , @entity3 had made an unusually conservative start and @entity46 made the breakthrough in his second over as @entity49 chipped to mid-on for a 34 - ball 18			1
a maximum off @entity54 aside , @entity52 continued to play conservatively until he went in the 22nd over , when @entity56 's slower delivery caused the opener to mistime his shot and hit straight back at the bowler for 56			0
@entity60 of @entity6 is stumped by @entity61 of @entity3 skipper @entity62 lasted just three balls after he sliced to @entity60 off @entity41 to leave the visitors 103 for three in the 23rd over			2
@entity66 and @entity2 went about rebuilding the innings , but @entity6 again struck at just the right time as @entity69 - swept to @entity70 off @entity56 for 20			1
@entity71 fell lbw to @entity38 for five before @entity61 was run out for two thanks to a direct hit by @entity46			0
at 159 for six @entity3 were firmly on the back foot , although @entity66 , who had just passed 50 , was still at the crease			2
@entity15 is used to attacking from the off when coming to the crease but with his side in a precarious position , the all rounder did not find the boundary until his 24th delivery			0
four balls later @entity66 was gone for 77 after he was bowled by @entity38 , before @entity15 smashed a trademark six back over the bowler 's head			0
@entity87 was run out for five before @entity38 picked up his third wicket , bowling @entity15 for 33 with the first ball of the final over			2
@entity6 - with the experienced @entity91 sitting out - were equally conservative with just five boundaries in the first 10 overs , though @entity60 hit two consecutively off @entity15 in the eighth			2
and just an over later the home side lost their first wicket when @entity60 was bowled by @entity97 , cutting when the delivery was too full			0
@entity99 was then run out for 32 to leave @entity6 80 for two in the 18th over			2
two wickets became three when @entity66 showed tremendous anticipation to move from first slip to leg slip when he saw @entity104 move into position to sweep , to take the catch off @entity97			0
@entity107 and @entity108 put on a much - needed 74 - run partnership before the latter fell for 34 , caught by @entity52 off the bowling of @entity112			0
with @entity6 's history of dramatic batting collapses to spur them on , @entity3 picked up a fifth wicket with 72 runs still needed when @entity107 was trapped in front by @entity15			1
with stability a necessity , @entity56 once again failed to provide it , inexplicably mis - timing a pull shot to mid-on @entity66 off @entity112			0
@entity70 was bowled by @entity87 for 19 and @entity46 ( 14 ) was caught by @entity2 off @entity15 before the game played out to an incredible conclusion .			0

@entity2 takes double - wicket maiden in the final over to secure victory
@entity3 complete whitewash and win the series 3 - 0 in @entity8
@entity3 made 231 - 9 from their before bowling @entity6 out for *230*
