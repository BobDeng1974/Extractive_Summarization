parallel universe : @entity2 - @entity1 told ' lie after lie ' in trying to establish his claim to the £ 5million a man who tried to squeeze a £ 5million fee from the sale of the house that inspired @entity10 was told he ' lives in a parallel universe ' by a high court judge in @entity14 yesterday			1
@entity2 - @entity15 hoped to make millions by acting as an intermediary in the sale of @entity18 near @entity19 in @entity20			1
and yesterday he went to court to sue the company set up to buy the 17th century pile for the disputed £ 5million fee			1
but mr @entity24 threw out the legal action against @entity26 and @entity27 after he found that mr @entity1 had constructed an elaborate scheme to convince the defendants to pay him millions for doing ' effectively nothing '			1
he said the case was rife with allegations of dishonesty with each side accusing the other of forging documents and ms @entity26 and @entity38 characterising mr @entity1 as a ' confidence trickster ' and ' middle man ' fraudster			1
mr @entity1 had acquired the contract for the grand house - thought to have been designed by @entity44 - from the @entity45 , a @entity47 order , for £ 22.5million in 2008			2
he claimed ms @entity26 , an @entity48 heiress living in @entity49 , @entity14 , owed him a £ 5million ' facilitating fee ' after he agreed to let her ' step into his shoes ' and buy the impressive property			1
the grand @entity18 was reputedly @entity55 's inspiration for @entity10 in his 1908 classic @entity57			2
ms @entity26 denied that there had been any such agreement			2
@entity38 eventually bought the stunning country property for £ 13million			2
mr @entity24 threw out the action after finding mr @entity1 had failed to establish his case , adding that it was clear the developer had a scheme in mind			1
the judge said it was clear mr @entity1 did not have the means to buy the property on his own and had instead planned to bring someone else in to provide the funding			2
he added : ' he was then to take a turn or commission by placing himself between that person and the @entity45			0
' he saw the opportunity to make £ 5million for doing effectively nothing			0
' ' in order to achieve that , he would have to deceive both the @entity45 , by giving them the false impression that he had the means and the intention to acquire the property himself , and the hapless punter , by pretending to him or her that he was a necessary intermediary			0
' in truth , and in law , he had no other role than as an officious bystander			0
' @entity10 : @entity18 , near @entity19 , @entity20 , was at the centre of a £ 5million court dispute mr @entity1 , added the judge in @entity14 , ' told lie after lie ' in his dealings with the @entity45 and ms hersham			1
' he even lied in his witness statements before the court , claiming for example that the @entity101 had previously provided finance for him in respect of other property developments			0
this he sought to explain away in court as a mistake			0
' the buyer : @entity26 , an @entity48 heiress , denied that she had agreed to pay mr @entity1 any fee despite his audacious lies , mr @entity24 said mr @entity1 had given the impression of being confident and self - assured while giving evidence to court			0
' yet it emerged very clearly from his two days and more of cross-examination that he lives in a parallel universe where truth and falsehood imperceptibly merge , the one into the other , he being quite insensitive to the distinction between them , ' the judge said			0
in his own mind mr @entity1 justified such behaviour as being necessary to survive in what the developer described as ' a commercial world out there '			1
he had accepted in court that he was ' not too scrupulous ' in what he was prepared to say to obtain business opportunities			1
the judge concluded that @entity38 did rely , as always intended by mr @entity1 , on false misrepresentations of fact and had it not done so , the purchase would not have been made			0
the company claims it has lost £ 9,864,940 from the transaction , but any compensation payments have yet to be finalised .			0

' he told lie after lie ' @entity141 in @entity14 is told
developer admitted he was ' not too scrupulous ' in his business dealings
