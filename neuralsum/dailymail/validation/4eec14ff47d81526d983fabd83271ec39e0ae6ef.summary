@entity0 take on @entity1 on friday morning looking to finish a dismal @entity3 campgain on a rare positive note			1
defeats to @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and , most embarrassingly , @entity9 , have seen @entity11 ' side crash out of the competition at the first side			0
but the @entity0 coach will hope his team can at least show some spirit against minnows @entity1 , to avoid going home having only beaten @entity19 all tournament			2
like @entity0 , their opponents have only picked up one win in the tournament and will be going home after this match , but for @entity1 a win against @entity19 was all they could have reasonably hoped to achieve			2
beating @entity0 would be a major scalp , and raise even more questions about captain @entity31 's side			1
realistically , @entity0 should be hoping for a dominant win , which might help salvage some confidence even if it comes too late to enable progress in the tournament			0
but with confidence levels as low as they can be , there is a chance of a defeat which would be even more shocking than monday 's failure against @entity9 .			0

@entity0 are already out of the @entity3 going into final pool match
