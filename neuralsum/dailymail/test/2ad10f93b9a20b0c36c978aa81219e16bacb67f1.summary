spiders on @entity1 may have been predicted by @entity2 , but in fact spiders in space could help us get to the red planet			1
@entity8 has revealed a system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels , trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit			1
the @entity17 - back firm says it could dramatically reduce the cost of building spacecraft by allowing the final construction to take place in orbit			2
@entity31 uses arachnid - like droids to construct large objects in orbit			1
@entity31 could cut construction costs by only launching raw materials such as carbon fibre into orbit			1
the robots can then piece together the materials while in orbit , finishing off the spacecraft			0
the futuristic new system – dubbed @entity31 – is being developed by a company called @entity42			2
the system uses arachnid - like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the @entity28 or further into the @entity45			1
' this process will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable ' embryonic ' state , ' the firm says			0
' once on orbit , these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to fabricate and integrate components such as antennas , shrouds , booms , concentrators , and optics			0
' the primary benefit of this on - orbit fabrication capability will be order - of - magnitude improvements in packing efficiency and system mass , which will enable @entity17 to use small , low - cost launch vehicles to deploy systems dramatically larger than possible with current state - of - the - art technologies			2
' the net payoff will be to enable @entity17 to acquire and distribute a variety of forms of data at higher resolution , higher bandwidth , higher signal - to - noise , and lower life - cycle cost			0
' ' our really long - term objective for all of this work is to eventually enable the use of in - situ resources to construct the infrastructure in space needed to support humanity 's expansion throughout the solar system , ' dr. @entity77 claimed last month during a presentation with @entity17 's future in - space operations ( @entity89 ) working group			1
under a @entity17 contract , the firm is currently implementing the first step in the @entity31 architecture : a machine that uses 3d printing techniques and robotic assembly to fabricate long , high - performance truss structures			1
he says the current way we build spacecraft is flawed			0
' it 's a very expensive and time - consuming process , and also , the size of systems is somewhat limited by the size of the deployables that are possible to fold up and fit within a launch shroud , ' he said			0
@entity42 hopes to launch its first working construction robot into space within the next couple of years			0
' in a perfect world — if funding flowed and the contracting process did n't drag on forever — we think we could get to be able to build very large support structures for antennas and solar arrays , and those sorts of components , in the early 2020s , ' dr. @entity77 said			0
the ' @entity123 ' device will enable construction of large support structures for systems such as multi-hundred - kilowat solar arrays , large solar sails , and football - field sized antennas			2

could be used to *create* the infrastructure to get man to @entity1
