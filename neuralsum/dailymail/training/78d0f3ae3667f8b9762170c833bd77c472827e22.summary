the magic eye probe had not been properly sterilised - and @entity2 was passed to mrs lane			1

a spokesman said : ' @entity1 dedicated herself to the @entity7 , she worked for the @entity7 and had total trust in the people and organisation looking after her			2
' we feel that she has been completely let down			0
' mother - of - two mrs @entity1 was making a good recovery after heart surgery and was ' living life to the full '			1
but she was readmitted two months after her operation when health chiefs at @entity21 realised there was a risk from the probe			1
mrs @entity1 , of @entity41 , @entity42 , died of acute liver failure three months after her heart operation			1
following her death a post mortem examination revealed she had contracted hepatitis b , which caused her death			0

' there were no national guidelines outlining the correct decontamination process of the probes at the time of mrs @entity1 ’s operation in march			1
' coroner @entity74 recorded a narrative verdict that mrs @entity1 caught hepatitis b because of failures in decontaminating an ultra-sound probe			1
ms @entity74 said : ' the likely source of the virus was probably the probe that had not been cleaned enough			0
