a man has smashed the record for growing the hottest chillies in the @entity3 - by shouting at them			1
@entity5 , 43 , grew the super hot @entity3 peppers by stressing them throughout the whole growing process			1
he denied them water , pretended to be a predator by ripping bits off - as he believes the heat is a natural defence against being eaten - and even shouted at them			1
he also produced a ' baby sister ' chilli called ' @entity36 - which measured a staggering 1,359,284 on the scale			1
the hottest chillies from around the world measure at least a million on the scale			2
mr @entity5 , the co-founder of @entity41 , said : ' we used a form of stressing to make the chillies even hotter			1
' no one has done tests but the @entity47 did a show about eight years ago where they spoiled and mistreated some chillies			0
the mistreated ones came out much hotter			0
' we denied them water so they began to wither			0
in my opinion , they also produce heat to defend against animals so i pretended to be an animal too			2
' i broke off bits to make the plant think it was being eaten			0
' i tried shouting at them as well but i have n't got that strong a voice			0
i was tempted to get someone from the @entity24 to shout at them but that would have been embarrassing			0
' the chillies are so hot that mr @entity5 had to wear two pairs of gloves and other protective clothing too hot to handle : the co-founder of @entity41 pretended to be an animal to make the chillies even hotter			1
mr @entity5 believes chillies produce heat to defend against predators developed by mr @entity5 's friend , the @entity3 's hottest chilies were named @entity31 and @entity36 mr @entity5 grew the two varieties of chilli after they were developed by a friend			1
they were named ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity36 ' after the developer 's daughters			2
grown in a poly - tunnel in @entity20 , @entity21 , between the spring and autumn , the chillies are so hot he had to wear two pairs of gloves and other protective clothing			1
' @entity31 ' will now be made into a sauce , called @entity91 , and sold at festivals			2
mr @entity5 said : ' we grew both varieties this summer and sent pods off to be tested			1
we were a little disappointed that the @entity36 , which was thought to be the hotter of the two , was a tiny bit under the record			0
' we were , however , delighted when the results of a pod test came in later from the @entity103 for @entity31			2
' it smashed the @entity3 record and beat the old one by 200,000 scovilles			1
' after trying a tiny bit i knew they were hot but i am overwhelmed by the results			0
i think we can thank the @entity112 we had			0
let 's see if we can better it next year			0
' the @entity116 scale is the measurement of the spicy heat ( pungency ) of chilli peppers or other spicy foods			2
created by @entity123 pharmacist @entity116 in 1912 , the @entity122 records @entity125 heat units based on the concentration of capsaicin .			0

@entity5 grew the @entity18 - unit chilli in @entity21
' @entity31 ' the chilli smashed the @entity3 record by 200,000 @entity133
mistreating the chillies caused them to produce blistering levels of heat
