by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:26 est , 10 february 2014 the first predators to walk on land were not afraid to bite off more than they could chew			0
these creatures had teeth like steak knives that let them ' rip and dismember ' larger prey , according to a new study			1
new research claims the @entity13 , which lived between 298 million and 272 million years ago , was the first land dwelling vertebrate with crocodile - like teeth			1
@entity17 found that the @entity13 , which lived between 298 million and 272 million years ago , was the first land dwelling vertebrate with crocodile - like teeth and it is thought that the so - called ziphodont teeth produced a more efficient bite allowing the @entity13 to prey on larger creatures			1
although most carnivorous dinosaurs had ziphodont teeth , researchers believe that serrated teeth first evolved in @entity13 around 40 million years earlier than theropods , a type of bipedal dinosaur			1
dr @entity30 , from the @entity31 said : ' the steak knife configuration of these teeth and the architecture of the skull suggest @entity13 was able to grab and rip and dismember large prey			1
' the @entity13 lived at least 50 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved around 280 million years ago , during the @entity39 period the @entity13 lived at least 50 million years before the first dinosaurs evolved around 280 million years ago , during the @entity39 period			2
it is an example of a pelycosaur -- one of the first families of reptiles to live entirely on land -- and went extinct about 250 million years ago			0
one of its most prominent features was its large sail , which ran along the entire length of its back			0
paleontologists speculate that the main purpose of this sail was temperature regulation or to help attract a mate			0
@entity57 , a graduate student from the @entity31 added : ' technologies such as scanning electron microscope ( @entity60 ) and histology allowed us to examine these teeth in detail to reveal previously unknown patterns in the evolutionary history of @entity13			1
' the study , published in @entity68 , found that the four - metre - long creature was at the top of the food chain in the early @entity39 and is the forerunner of all mammals			1
the @entity39 lasted from 299 to 251 million years ago and was the last period of the @entity75			0
according to the research , @entity13 had a group of previously unknown tooth structures and were also the first vertebrate to develop cusps , teeth with raised points on the crown			1
these are common in mammals			0
the study also suggests ziphodont teeth were confined to later species of @entity13 , indicating a gradual change in feeding habits			1
dr @entity30 said : ' this research is an important step in reconstructing the structure of ancient complex communities			0
' teeth tell us a lot more about the ecology of animals than just looking at the skeleton			0
' we already know from fossil evidence which animals existed at that time but now with this type of research we are starting to piece together how the members of these communities interacted			0
' researchers looked at the changes in @entity13 teeth across 25 million years of evolution and found that skull shapes did not change even though tooth shape did			2
' teeth fossils have attracted a lot of attention in dinosaurs but much less is known about the animals that lived during this first chapter in terrestrial evolution , ' added dr @entity30			2
researchers looked at the changes in @entity13 teeth across 25 million years of evolution and found that skull shapes did not change even though tooth shape did			2
@entity57 and @entity30 are shown here with a @entity13 skull			0

*scientists* believe it was first terrestrial vertebrate to develop serrated teeth
the crocodile - like teeth allowed it to ' grab and rip and dismember large prey '
teeth confined to later species indicating a gradual change in feeding habits
four - metre - long @entity13 is considered to be the forerunner of mammals
