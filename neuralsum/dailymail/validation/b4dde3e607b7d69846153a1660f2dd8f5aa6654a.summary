@entity0 may have been witness to a stunning aurora displays , but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on @entity6			1
because @entity6 has a very thin atmosphere , the sun 's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows			1
and their behaviour does n't always follow existing rules			0
@entity15 scientists were recently stunned to discover aurora that reaches deep into the @entity6 atmosphere			1
artist ’s conception of @entity21 's @entity20 ( @entity20 ) observing the “ @entity22 " on @entity6			2
maven observations show that aurora on @entity6 is similar to @entity0 ’s " @entity25 " but penetrates deep into the atmosphere @entity0 has a magnetic shield , known as a magnetosphere , that protects its atmosphere from radiation from the sun. aurora take place on @entity0 because some of the sun 's energetic particles have managed to break through this shield			1
@entity6 , however , only has a very thin atmosphere			2
its magnetosphere was lost billions of years ago turning a once watery world into the barren planet we see today			0
when solar particles hit the red planet , they can hit the atmosphere directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows			0
@entity21 's @entity46 ( @entity20 ) also observed what scientists have named ' @entity50 lights			0
' for five days just before dec. 25 , @entity21 saw a bright ultraviolet auroral glow spanning @entity6 ' northern hemisphere			1
@entity53 , known on @entity0 as northern or southern lights , are caused by energetic particles like electrons crashing down into the atmosphere and causing the gas to glow			2
' what 's especially surprising about the aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at @entity0 or elsewhere on @entity6 , ' said @entity64 , @entity20 team member at the @entity65			1
' the electrons producing it must be really energetic			0
' the source of the energetic particles appears to be the sun. @entity21 's @entity71 instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the aurora			0
billions of years ago , @entity6 lost a global protective magnetic field like @entity0 has , so solar particles can directly strike the atmosphere			2
the electrons producing the aurora have about 100 times more energy than you get from a spark of house current , so they can penetrate deeply in the atmosphere			0
they also made the unexpected discovery of dust about 93 miles ( 150 km ) to 190 miles ( 300 km ) above the red planet 's surface			1
although the source and composition of the dust are unknown , @entity15 said there is no hazard to @entity21 probe and other spacecraft orbiting @entity6			2
a map of @entity21 's auroral detections in december 2014 overlaid on @entity6 ’ surface			1
the map shows that the aurora was widespread in the northern hemisphere , not tied to any geographic location			1
the aurora was detected in all observations during a 5 - day period ' if the dust originates from the atmosphere , this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the @entity6 atmosphere , ' said @entity111 of the @entity65 's @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , @entity114 , @entity115			1
it is unknown if the cloud is a temporary phenomenon or something long lasting			0
the cloud density is greatest at lower altitudes			0
however , even in the densest areas it is still very thin			0
so far , no indication of its presence has been seen in observations from any of the other @entity21 instruments			0
possible sources for the observed dust include dust wafted up from the atmosphere ; dust coming from @entity134 , the two moons of @entity6 ; dust moving in the solar wind away from the sun ; or debris orbiting the sun from comets			2
however , no known process on @entity6 can explain the appearance of dust in the observed locations from any of these sources			1
the findings are being presented this week at the 46th @entity148 and @entity147 in @entity149 , @entity150			0
@entity0 may have been witness to a stunning displays of the aurora ( pictured ) , but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on @entity6 because has a thin atmosphere , the sun 's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper			1
@entity15 has only been able to detect the aurora rather capture it in an image			0

maven probe *spotted* ultraviolet auroral glow in northern hemisphere
what was *suprising* was how deep in the atmosphere aurora occurred
dust was also found up to 190 miles ( 300 km ) above planet 's surface
no known process on @entity6 can explain the appearance of dust clouds
