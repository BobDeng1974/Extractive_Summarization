she also appealed for the @entity15 police to contact her family to ‘ eliminate my father from the investigation ’ and find out who was the target of the mass shooting			1
miss @entity4 spoke out after a @entity15 detective identified her father as having been married to @entity23 , 47 , between february 1999 and december 2000			1

he suffered from high blood pressure and was said officially to have died from a heart attack			2
but @entity47 , a senior @entity15 detective , has raised the possibility that mrs @entity23 ’s covert relationship with mr @entity1 may have provided a motive for the murders			1
and miss @entity4 , 38 , said that in light of the potential link to such a mysterious case , she wants his body examined			0
she said that no autopsy was carried out on mr @entity1 , meaning questions about potential toxins in his system remain unanswered			0

her brother @entity76 would probably oppose it and she was not sure about her aunt @entity78			0
but she said : ‘ i would not have a problem with the exhumation for the simple fact that the corpse there is not my father , it ’s just the shell of him			0
‘ if there is something in his body i would want to know what it is			0
if the @entity11 agree , i would comply with it			0
’ there are a range of theories about why the @entity62 , of @entity70 , @entity71 , were targeted			0
the family originally came from @entity27 , and one theory is that their links to the regime of former dictator @entity99 may be a reason for their murders			0
