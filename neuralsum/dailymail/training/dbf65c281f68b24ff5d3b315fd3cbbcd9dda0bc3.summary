it was the story of the day yesterday , and television newscasters the world over rushed to broadcast the news that @entity4 had died in @entity5			1
so it is , perhaps , no surprise that one or two of them did n't get it quite right ... a @entity12 news station aired footage of @entity14 while reporting the death of the former @entity17 prime minister			1
the newscaster said : ' we 've learned the breaking news that ex prime minister , the @entity4 , @entity4 , died at home in @entity5 due to stroke today , the 8th , this morning , at the age of 88			2
' a spokesperson for @entity4 has publicly confirmed this news			2
what we know is that @entity4 has been suffering ill health in recent years			2
' since more than 10 years ago , she 's suffered numerous minor strokes			0
just last december , she had surgery in @entity5 to remove a bladder tumour			0
' it is not known why the station gave her age as 88 , but it could either be an error or down to the @entity71 custom of counting one 's age as starting with one when you are born			1
@entity23 , left , in character as the @entity4 for the film of the same name about @entity4 , right the station apologised last night after viewers criticised the station for failing to distinguish between the two famous @entity17 women			1
meanwhile in @entity86 , news producers for the country 's army - owned @entity83 made a similar error , using a photograph of actress @entity23 when they reported news of @entity4 's death this morning			1
for nearly two minutes , the channel displayed @entity4 's biography alongside a picture of @entity23 in character for the film @entity96 , which tells the story of the @entity99 's life			1
the production team wrote on @entity101 later : ' we will improve and develop our work more carefully and are deeply sorry			0
' @entity4 died yesterday at the @entity104 in @entity5 aged 87 after suffering a stroke			0
@entity106 & @entity107 : how to make your voice heard if you believe @entity4 deserves a state funeral , and want the government to know , sign this online petition and submit it to us			0
we will pass it to the prime minister 's office at 10 @entity117			0

@entity21 @entity83 used image of actress @entity23 from film @entity96
