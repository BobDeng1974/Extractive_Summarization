by @entity0 it ’s like a science experiment which has gone horribly wrong			2
the weirdly hypnotic event of a piece of putty devouring a magnet was captured on camera by @entity8			1
the @entity10 video clip took @entity8 an hour and a half to film , but thanks to a time - lapse sequence , it can be seen in all its glory over a matter of minutes			1
however , it might need to be played repeatedly to make sure your eyes are n’t playing tricks			2
as @entity8 explains on his @entity10 page : ‘ @entity43 particles in the putty are strongly attracted to the magnet and very slowly engulf the surface of the magnet			1
‘ the putty looks and feels like regular silly putty , but the difference lies in the fact that it has been infused with millions of micron - sized ferrous particles			1
’ and it would n't work with just any old magnet , as the one in the video has very special properties			1
@entity8 noted that the magnet shown in the clip is a powerful neodymium iron boron magnet			1
it ’s the type that can destroy a tv screen or disable the magnetic strip on a credit card			1
eventually , the putty would arrange itself around the magnet so it 's as evenly distributed as possible			1
an estimated 140 million people use magnetic therapy to relieve pain , improve circulation , reduce swelling , minimize stiffness , and increase overall performance			2
they include professional athletes , doctors and chiropractors			2
scientist and medical experts believe that magnets heal and strengthen the body			0
a review in the @entity79 suggests that repetitive magnetic stimulation benefits numerous psychiatric disorders , including depression and mania			0
a strong magnetic field is used to induce electric currents that modulate the neuronal circuits ; these changes resemble those produced by antidepressant drugs			0
double - blind studies at @entity91 , published in the @entity92 concluded that permanent magnets reduce pain in post-polio patients			2
the results were reported in the @entity97			0
@entity98 also reported on the growing use of magnets by champion golfers and other professional athletes to relieve pain and improve strength			0
magnetic therapy has long been a significant component of the health industry in @entity107 and @entity108			0
therapeutic applications of magnetic fields are now becoming a scientifically acceptable and respected part of the medical communities of the @entity113 and @entity114			0
there are now @entity116 and the @entity117 all over the world which use magnets to treat and cure a wide range of illnesses and injuries			0
evidence gained from research suggests that magnetic therapy may : relieve pain reduce inflammation naturally increase the production of melatonin and the growth hormone restore energy increase blood circulation and release of oxygen from free radicals prevent or reverse infectious states and degenerative diseases promote metabolic processing of toxins support the healing process			0

@entity10 video shows the *incredible* powers of putty which has a mind of its own
powerful magnet that can destroy a tv screen
time - lapse special effects demonstrates the *voracious* nature of the *silicone* *substance* when under the influence of iron
