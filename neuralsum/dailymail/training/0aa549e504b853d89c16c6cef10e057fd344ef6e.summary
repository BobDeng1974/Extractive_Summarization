by @entity0 plans to blow up five city tower blocks at the opening of the @entity4 have been ditched with only 100 days to go after organisers were forced into an embarrassing u-turn			1
games chiefs had wanted to use 2,755lbs of explosives to demolish the @entity10 @entity9 in an event which would have been seen by a worldwide tv audience of more than a billion people			1
despite outraged critics branding the proposals ‘ callous ’ , ‘ insensitive ’ and ‘ crass ’ – and more than 17,000 people signing a petition calling for them to be scrapped – organisers had insisted the show would go ahead on july 23			1
controversial : five tower blocks which have been part of @entity10 's skyline for almost 50 years were to be blown up as part of the @entity4 opening ceremony relics : six of the original eight tower blocks remain after two earlier demolitions , one in 2012 and one last year ( pictured ) but in a victory for common sense yesterday – the day after the @entity29 @entity28 revealed that families living in the shadow of the flats would refuse to leave on demolition day in protest – the proposals were abandoned under health and safety fears			1
change of plan : although the blocks will still be brought down , it will not form part of the @entity4 the decision to drop the plans is an embarrassment for the @entity48 organisers and first minister @entity49 , who , as the @entity29 @entity28 revealed , knew of the project in february , despite claims he only learned about it on april 1			1
in a tv interview yesterday , mr @entity49 said the u-turn was a ‘ sensible decision ’ that will be ‘ welcomed widely ’			1
however , critics said he must explain how the farcical situation had arisen in the first place			0
there was little sign of contrition and certainly no apology from those behind the aborted plans			0
five of the six remaining blocks are still scheduled to be demolished but there are no details of what will replace their demise as the highlight of the @entity4 opening ceremony , centred at @entity74			1
last night , critics , protesters and people who live near the high - rises welcomed the news of the u-turn			1
mother - of - three @entity81 , 33 , whose home is in the shadow of the flats , was one of those who threatened to stay in the blast zone to scupper the plan			1
she said : ‘ we had to act to stop the demolition happening purely for entertainment			0
you have to remember that it would have been blowing up people ’s memories on live television			2
‘ it would just not have been right and that ’s why we said we would not be moved			0
blowing up five at once will leave us with so much dirt and dust it would be unbearable			0
‘ i was also very concerned that my roof and walls would be badly damaged in the blast			0
’ @entity103 opened with @entity104 and @entity105 parachuting into the @entity107 - bosses of @entity108 planned their own explosive opening by blowing up five tower blocks - but have now changed their mind former @entity29 socialist msp @entity112 , who began the public petition against the demolition , said she was ‘ relieved and extremely pleased ’ about the decision			1
she added : ‘ i think it ’s great , it ’s a sensible decision			0
i think everybody will be relieved and i think the more than - 17,000 people who expressed their views in the petition will be relieved			1
‘ it ’s an indication that people power can be effective			2
’ the climbdown came in a statement released yesterday afternoon			0
@entity127 made it clear that as anger grew over the plan , the stance of local people had ‘ changed the safety and security context ’ of the @entity4 and revealed that they had asked organisers to reconsider the whole idea			2
summer of sport : the 11 days of competition in @entity10 will begin on july 23 @entity141 , @entity10 2014 chief executive , last week publicly defended the demolition proposals			2
but last night he said : ‘ the decision to feature the live demolition of five @entity9 blocks within the opening ceremony was planned both as commemoration of a part of @entity10 ’s social history , as well as a statement of the city ’s regeneration			1
‘ we made it clear from the outset the absolute priority was safety and that this event would only happen during the opening ceremony if it was safe to do so			1
‘ over the past few days it has become clear that opinions have been expressed which change the safety and security context			0
‘ @entity10 2014 , games partners and key stakeholders , including @entity127 and @entity166 , are not prepared to allow what was proposed to be a positive act of commemoration to create risk for all concerned			0
’ in his tv interview yesterday , mr @entity49 said : ‘ i think it ’s a sensible decision that will be widely welcomed			2
there are two aspects – one is the safety aspect which has been cited by the organising committee			0
‘ and secondly there ’s a wider aspect : the @entity4 are a unifying force for @entity10 and @entity29 and we want all aspects of the @entity4 to bring @entity10 and @entity29 together			0
’ @entity29 hero : @entity183 helped to celebrate @entity10 's velodrome for the @entity4 , but the decision to blow up the flats caused outrage locally the first minister added : ‘ i do n’t think the safety issue is “ face - saving ” , it ’s very , very important			2
’ the @entity191 ’ sports spokesman @entity190 , @entity192 , said the climbdown was ‘ a victory for common sense ’			0
she added : ‘ let ’s not forget that @entity29 ’s first minister was involved in the decision - making process			0
@entity49 now has some explaining to do as to why we ever got into this farcical situation			2
’ labour insiders claim the @entity202 has been desperate to protect mr @entity49 from the fall - out sparked by the furious reaction to the demolition plan and a @entity206 insider accused the @entity29 government of a ‘ cover - up ’ .			1
