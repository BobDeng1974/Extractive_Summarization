@entity0 kept his nerve to clinch a final frame decider over @entity3 in the first round of the @entity5 in @entity6			1

there 's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing			0
' you 're telling yourself it 's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be			0
' @entity0 , who will play either @entity39 or @entity40 in the second round , is no stranger to @entity21 drama having fended off a famous comeback from @entity43 in last year 's quarter - finals			2
