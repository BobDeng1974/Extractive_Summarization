by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:37 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 10 july 2013 a teenage driver and his passenger died after he broke the speed limit to get home to beat his insurance company ’s curfew , a coroner has said			1
@entity10 ’s policy allowed him to drive between 5am and 11pm and his @entity11 was fitted with a @entity13 ‘ black box ’ that monitored when it was driven and how fast			1
a breach of the curfew would have incurred a £ 100 penalty - but he would not have been penalised for speeding unless he was 50 per cent over the limit			1
friends : @entity10 ( second right , striped top ) , 18 , repeatedly broke speed limits as he drove at up to 74mph as he and his friend @entity22 ( second left , light blue top ) , 17 , returned home mr @entity10 , 18 , repeatedly broke speed limits as he drove at up to 74mph as he and his friend @entity22 , 17 , returned home to @entity26 , near @entity27 , @entity28 , from @entity29 , near @entity30			1
they were minutes from home when , at 10.42pm on november 13 last year , mr @entity10 lost control of the car at a bend on a lane near the @entity38 services and hit two trees			1
both teenagers died of head injuries			0
returning verdicts of accidental death at the inquest in @entity45 yesterday , acting @entity28 coroner @entity46 said he was satisfied mr @entity10 ’s rush to beat the curfew was ‘ a very significant factor in his driving ’			1
mr @entity46 will write to insurers @entity52 to voice his ‘ real concern of future deaths ’ over rules which he said ‘ incentivise ’ young drivers to speed to beat the curfew			2
@entity59 collision investigator @entity58 said the car was doing 57mph when it went out of control			0
the limit on the lane was 60mph and the tracking system showed that mr @entity10 had reached up to 74 mph that night			1
but for the seven to eight months before the accident mr @entity10 had complied well with the speed and curfew limits set by the insurers , @entity65 said			1
' this trip seems to have been an exception to his previous driving record , ' the officer said			0
' he exceeded the limit throughout the journey right up to the collision point			0
' one must question why he decided he needed to drive quickly on this journey - the answer to which , i believe , lies with the tracking device and the criteria of its use			2
' it is probable he believed he had to hurry back to avoid a curfew penalty			1
on that journey he exceeded the speed limit on numerous occasions			0
horror : teenage driver @entity10 and @entity22 died following a crash on on a lane near the @entity38 , pictured ' but none of the speeds would have attracted any sort of reprimand from @entity93			1
' speaking at the inquest , mr @entity46 said : ' it does appear that the curfew was the factor causing him to drive as he did			1
' on the balance of probabilities i think his decision to go at this speed was due to his wish to avoid breaching the curfew penalty			1
' how it works : @entity52 's managing director said the technology had been launched in 2006 under rule 43 of the @entity109 , he would write to @entity52 to voice his ‘ real concern of future deaths ’ if the system was not amended , he said			1
the coroner said he acknowledged that the system was designed by @entity52 to reduce irresponsible driving by young motorists and therefore reduce insurance premiums with a reward system			1
but it appeared the system had also created a risk			2
' my letter will be asking that this risk is addressed , ' he said			0
' there is a fresh potential risk arising from the institution of this curfew			2
' i would suggest perhaps a balance should be struck between the penalties imposed for breach of curfew and for speeding			1
perhaps the maximum speed limits should be reduced			0
' it may require extra technology but it is something i believe should be addressed			0
i do n’t raise any question of blame in respect of the technology			0
' it is designed , as far as i can see , with good intentions			0
it might only need fine tuning of the penalties to avoid the deaths of young drivers trying to beat the clock			0
' @entity52 ’s managing director @entity147 told the inquest the technology had been launched in 2006			0
two young drivers had died in accidents while subject to the system but neither was on the road close to curfew time , he said			1
' there is a fresh potential risk arising from the institution of this curfew ' coroner @entity46 he said the driving record of all policy holders was taken into account when insurance was renewed and those who had not been speeding would get lower premiums			1
' we have sold over 15,000 of these policies and this is the first case i have come across like this , ' he said			0
the average financial saving for a young driver who bought one of their policies and agreed to the penalty clauses would be £ 450 to £ 500 a year , he added			2
the reason for the 11pm - 5am curfew was that those were the hours when most severe accidents involving young drivers occurred , he said			1
insurance : a breach of the curfew would have incurred a £ 100 penalty - but he would not have been penalised for speeding unless he was 50 per cent over the limit			1
a file image of a black box is pictured currently the ‘ black box ’ policy means that youngsters can drive up to 50 per cent over the speed limit before they get a warning from the insurer - up to 90mph on a road with a 60mph speed limit			2
mr @entity10 ’s mother @entity198 said she felt the speeding condition should be lowered			2
‘ it gives them too much leeway - 50 per cent is too high , ’ mrs @entity200 said			0
‘ it needs to be more like the police rules , which are 10 per cent over , plus 2mph			0
’ ' we had told him that if he thought he was not going to be home by 11pm to call us and tell us			2
we might have been a bit miffed but we would sort out getting him home ' @entity200 , 44 , @entity10 's mother she also believes that learner drivers should be taught to drive at a speed suitable for the conditions , rather than driving to a speed limit			1
‘ these country roads have a 60mph speed limit but it is not safe to drive at that speed , ’ she said			2
‘ he was going 57mph at the time of his accident , but he was going above the speed limit			0
‘ at the time of @entity226 's accident it was also wet roads , there were leaves , and everyone here knows it is a road notorious for lots of deer			2
kids need to be taught to drive for the individual conditions			2
’ mr @entity10 was quoted more than £ 3,000 for an insurance policy when he passed his test - and the black box reduced that to £ 1,850			1
but mrs pain , 44 , is not convinced that her son was speeding in order to beat the curfew			0
‘ he was three minutes from home and had 18 minutes to get back when the accident happened , ’ she said			0
‘ @entity226 knew he had to be home by 11pm			0
he was minutes from home			0
we had told him that if he thought he was not going to be home by 11pm to call us and tell us			0
we might have been a bit miffed but we would sort out getting him home			0

@entity10 's insurance policy allowed him to drive from 5am to 11pm
@entity11 was fitted with *gps* system monitoring when it was driven
breach of the curfew imposed by firm would have incurred £ 100 penalty
