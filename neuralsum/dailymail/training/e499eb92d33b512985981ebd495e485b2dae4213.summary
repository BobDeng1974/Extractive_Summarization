emergency laws to record phone calls , texts and people 's internet history could be rushed through @entity5 , amid growing fears over the threat posed by radicalised @entity9 muslims returning from @entity10			1
ministers have been forced to act after the @entity13 courts ruled that @entity15 powers to monitor people 's phone and internet records were illegal			1
the government is concerned that the april ruling has left a gaping hole in the security services ability to track and prosecute terrorists			2
deputy prime minister @entity38 has rejected accusations that the new laws amount to a ' snoopers ' charter ' being introduced through the back door			1
last year mr @entity38 blocked @entity44 's controversial communications data bill - which would have dramatically increased the government 's ability to monitor people 's phone and internet usage			2
the @entity50 are expected to reintroduce the bill if they win the next election			0
the wider issue of phone and internet surveillance had been expected to have been shelved until after the election , but the @entity13 court 's ruling has forced the government to act sooner than expected @entity33 is likely to suggest that the new emergency laws should have some form of ' sunset clause ' to review them after a set period , the @entity59 reported this morning			1
shadow home secretary @entity65 has also argued for a wider review of the powers given to the security services			0
home secretary @entity44 is concerned that a @entity13 court ruling makes it harder for the security services and police to monitor terror threats a @entity34 source said @entity38 was open - minded about boosting government powers but said : ' there is no question of a snooper 's charter , watered down or otherwise , being introduced by this government			1
' the source added : ' the government does have to respond to the @entity13 court of justice ruling , which we are currently examining , and will respond in due course			1
but that is about the retention of existing powers rather than their extension			0
' a @entity89 spokesperson said : ' the retention of communications data is absolutely fundamental to ensure law enforcement have the powers they need to investigate crime , protect the public and ensure national security			0
' we are carefully considering the @entity13 court of justice 's judgment on data retention and are currently examining potential next steps			1
' but @entity103 , acting director of @entity104 , said : ' it would be reckless to attempt to legislate on further surveillance powers before a comprehensive , independent review of the existing legal framework has taken place			2
' a broad political consensus has emerged in support of a comprehensive review in recognition of the fact that the public should know more about how existing surveillance laws are being used and whether the current oversight mechanisms are adequate			0
' it is a basic principle of a free society that you do n’t monitor people who are not under suspicion			0
considering the @entity123 has already been rejected by the public as well as by the highest court in @entity13 , it is essential that the government does not rush head first into creating new legislation			2
' the @entity130 ’s data retention laws privatised snooping , meaning companies were paid by governments to record what citizens were doing and retain that information for a year			0
' we need to get back to a point where the police monitor people who are actually suspected of wrong doing and rather than wasting millions every year requiring data to be stored on an indiscriminate basis			0
