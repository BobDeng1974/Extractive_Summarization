it was a deeply disturbing homecoming for @entity1 , then 21			1
she had returned to @entity3 from her astrophysics course at the @entity6 ’s @entity5 in 2012 , when news of a series of netizens ’ arrests spurred by powerful politicians started making headlines			1
behind these arrests lurked a relatively young dark law : @entity14 of the @entity15			1
@entity1 decided to file a public interest litigation			1
a little over two years later , justice @entity17 of the @entity18 got up from his chair after announcing , “ @entity20 of the @entity15 ( it ) act , 2000 , is hereby struck down in its entirety			1
” petitioner @entity1 and her mother @entity23 were thrilled with the ruling a packed courtroom noisily greeted the landmark judgment upholding online freedom of speech and expression			1
the two - judge bench headed by the son of legendary jurist @entity31 had struck down as “ unconstitutional ” and “ vague ” the draconian provision which gave “ sweeping and unbridled power ” to the police to arrest anyone for offensive posts on social networking websites or sending messages through mobile phones and tablets			1
for @entity1 , daughter of @entity18 lawyer @entity23 and granddaughter of @entity44 high court judge @entity42 , a long battle against the might of the state had just ended			1
shock and anger “ i was shocked by the arrests , including of a @entity53 professor , for circulating a picture spoofing @entity56 chief minister @entity55 and her party colleague @entity57 ; imprisonment of @entity60 businessman @entity59 for allegedly posting offensive messages on @entity62 about @entity65 leader @entity64 ’s son @entity63 , ” she said			1
but the trigger for her @entity67 was the arrest of two girls in @entity70 for a critical online post about the shut - down in the city for @entity75 ’s funeral			1
“ i got really angry			0
the law was blatantly being misused			2
the provision was extremely vague in its definition of what should go on the @entity80 , ” she said			2
@entity1 ’s petition raised an avalanche			2
eight other petitioners , including writer @entity84 , joined her after a year			0
@entity20 , brought about by a defensive @entity85 which was increasingly getting cornered and badgered on the social media , surprisingly found a friend in the incumbent government , which defended it in @entity18			2
no definition the court found merit in @entity1 ’s argument that the language used in @entity14 is so vague that the accused would not know what the offence was , and nor would the authorities be clear on the charges			1
it prescribed a three - year jail term for posts which are “ grossly offensive ” or had a “ menacing character ” or e-mails which caused “ annoyance ” or “ inconvenience ” to the recipient			0
what is worse is that none of these expressions had been defined			0
this went against the principles of criminal law which require each and every term to be well - defined , leaving no scope for misinterpretation and possible misuse			2
“ you ca n’t jail anyone just like that			0
i am not saying you should defame anyone			0
but one should not be scared to post anything now as long as public order is respected , ” said @entity1			2
the court noted that the vagueness could be misused by governments with an agenda			0
in a last ditch effort to save the provision , additional solicitor general @entity128 had submitted that the @entity131 was ready to amend the law and fervently pleaded against scrapping it			0
he said it was meant to deter people from uploading grossly offensive material which can lead to lawlessness by inciting public anger and violence			0
he had also assured it would be administered in a reasonable manner and would not be misused			0
but the court was not impressed			0
freedom “ the section has a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression			0
the right of viewers is also infringed as it would not give them the benefit of the many shades of grey in terms of various points of view that could be viewed over the @entity80 , ” the bench said in its 122 - page judgment			0
@entity1 is still in her third year of law at the @entity158 , with an accomplishment even those with 30 years in practice would cherish .			1

@entity163 of the @entity15 saw @entity3 arrested simply for *sharing* their views on @entity165 and @entity62
*student* @entity1 filed a @entity67 against vague and sinister law
@entity18 has now declared it ' unconstitutional '
