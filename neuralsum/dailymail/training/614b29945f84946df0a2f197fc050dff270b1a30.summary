‘ have you met the @entity1 ? she rides a lot			2
she should come here and ride with me ! ’ @entity6 ’s eyes brightened at the prospect			2
‘ she likes polo too ! ’ he added gleefully			0
‘ we do n’t get to do enough of that here ! ’ but for @entity6 – real name @entity15 – there ’s no shortage of excitement to be found closer to home in southern @entity20 ’s picturesque @entity19			1
while polo might be an occasional treat for him , a bigger treat for me was just around the next acacia bush			2
‘ look , look ! ’ he hissed , standing up in his stirrups			0
saddle up on safari : @entity30 ( left ) with @entity31 during a sunlit evening galloping around the savannah crashing through the underbrush , its broad grey back seemingly impervious to the spiny shrubs , was an enormous elephant			0
there was nothing but a short stretch of scrubby grass between it and me			0
a 100km stretch of volcanic mountains bisected by broad , grassy plains studded with thorny acacia trees , the @entity19 might be a national park but they ’re barely known compared to the mighty @entity50 to the west and the wildlife - packed @entity52 to the east			1
as a result , you ’re never likely see hordes of vehicles converge on a sighting , if , indeed , you see anyone else at all			0
what you will find , however , are animals and plenty of them			0
within seconds of stepping off the little bush plane that ferried us down to @entity66 from @entity68 ’s international airport , we ’d spotted a couple of honking wildebeest , a twitchy group of oryx and a dazzle – yes , that is the proper name – of peacefully grazing zebra			1
magnificent : a giraffe picks its way delicately through the @entity19 , photographed by @entity79 's @entity78 sundowner with a difference : a group of local @entity84 troop down the hill to dance for visitors at ol @entity87 but while seeing them from a game vehicle is fun , nothing beats getting up close and personal from the back of a horse			1
@entity95 was named @entity30 , a word that means cloud in the local @entity99 language and given to him on account of his pristine cream - coloured hide			1
we got along from the start , his nippy turn of pace and eagle eye for thorny bushes dovetailing neatly with my own plans : to see as much of the local wildlife as possible , while beating the zebras at their own game as they galloped across the savannah			1
with me was @entity6 , given the @entity118 honorific meaning grandfather by the younger men , and a chap who certainly knows his stuff when it comes to wildlife			2
stunning : the lovely ol @entity87 is run by the charming ( and very funny ) @entity124 and @entity126 striking : during the @entity129 , more than a million wildebeest and zebra stream into the @entity50 ‘ you see that ? ’ he ’d ask as my much - younger eyes tried and failed to pick out a black - backed jackal scurrying along in the distance			1
‘ you see ? ’ sometimes i did , quite often i did n’t			0
what i did see a lot of were elephants , many of which came daily to drink from the watering hole in front of ol @entity144 where i stayed			1
a quirky mix of modern cool and @entity150 detail , the lodge sits on a huge private reservation and boasts its own stables , as well as entertainment in the shape of managers @entity124 and @entity126 and their lovely staff			1
my room was vast – easily as big as the average @entity159 flat and with a private deck , complete with a personal pool			1
from here , i watched as the local giraffes and elephants trudged to and from the water , scattering smaller game as they made their way through the trees			1
enjoying the view : along with wildebeest , a balloon ride is a good way to see buffalo and gazelle adorable : @entity176 unearthed a cute dik dik antelope within 15 minutes of beginning the search it would have been easy to stay put by that pool but @entity30 was waiting as was @entity181 ’ @entity183 ’s other big natural attraction – a set of enormous fossilised lava tubes			2
perched high on a hilltop , 30 minutes of rugged safari track and regular game sightings away , seeing @entity187 ’s lava tubes requires sensible shoes – ideally not the suede loafers i had on – and nerves of steel			0
down a steep track littered with rocks you go , dodging rock fig roots and keeping a safe distance from the local bats as you do			2
inside , the tunnels are dark and vast , massive burned black walls , fractured with streaks of red sandstone			0
it feels a bit like being in your own @entity209 film , albeit that the treasure at the end is emerging , blinking into the light to find sundowners and ‘ bities ’ waiting for you			0
@entity216 , or small canapes , are one of the highlights of a @entity20 safari and @entity187 does them especially well			1
banana and bacon bites , salty macadamia nuts and tiny goat ’s cheese toasts all go down well after a hike deep into a lava tube			0
delicious though they were , they tasted best following a sweaty gallop across the plain below with @entity30 and @entity6			0
on my first horseback safari , i found myself getting unexpectedly close to the natives : sitting quietly as a giraffe passed within feet of us , watching as a jackal – most of which dash off at the first rumbling of a car engine – edged closer , and freezing as an elephant ventured by			1
adorable : the @entity50 is crammed with wildlife , among them the @entity244 , hippos and cheetah ‘ if it charges at us , we ’ll gallop away , ’ said @entity6 , reassuringly , although we never had to			1
lions and other big cats are few and far between in the @entity19 , not so good for first time visitors to @entity20 but better for those who want to ride			1
and in any case , there were plenty where we were going next : the mighty @entity50			1
@entity255 , cheetah , leopard , hippo , elephant , giraffe and many more , you do n’t have to go far to see something			0
with a @entity150 guide like @entity176 , the fantastically knowledgeable man in charge of our party , it takes minutes			1
‘ what do you want to see ? ’ he asked as we clambered into the car			0
i wanted to see a dik dik – an adorably tiny antelope with huge @entity276 eyes			0
@entity277 : sundowners with @entity84 guide @entity176 came with a spectacular view by the time we reached @entity281 , an open tented camp run by a cheerful @entity283 named @entity284 and his @entity20 wife @entity285 , we ’d seen one			1
while you fall asleep to the quiet sound of giraffes brushing through the bushes at @entity187 , at @entity84 , it ’s to the huffing noise of hunting lions and the honking of their prey – wildebeest			2
it was the same story again at @entity298 , a tiny tented camp close to the @entity300 where each year , millions of wildebeest and zebra pile through the water en masse during the @entity129			2
although we did n’t see a crossing , we did get up early for a balloon flight that gave some sense of the scale of it			0
below our silent vehicle , scores of wildebeest dotted the plain like black ants spilling from a termite mound , albeit much noisier			0
it was a truly incredible sight			0
but much in @entity20 is incredible			1
from the bright pink flamingos of @entity319 to the gorgeous @entity321 beaches of the coast where i ended my trip , it ’s hard not to fall in love with the place			0
perfect finish : the trip ended with a few days spent relaxing on a gorgeous @entity329 in @entity330 sitting in a deckchair at the gorgeous @entity332 , an idyllic bolthole perched on a sugar sand beach in @entity330 , i did n’t want to leave			0
but it was the @entity19 that proved the real eye opener			1
hidden away in a corner of the country rarely visited by foreign tourists , overshadowed by the mighty @entity341 and home to some of the most beautiful beasts on the planet , the national park is a real hidden gem			1
much like @entity6 in fact			0
perhaps he really will get to play polo with the @entity1 one day			0
in the meantime , he ’ll have to settle for watching the elephants go by with me			2

in @entity330 , we stayed at the beautiful @entity332 , which boasts a beachfront setting and where rooms start at £ 70 ( $ 121 ) per person , per night			0
flights to @entity20 with @entity368 from @entity159 start at £ 732.41 ( $ 1,228 ) return			2
@entity371 flights with @entity372 start at £ 1,840 ( $ 3,082 ) for a private plane seating 12			2

@entity20 's @entity19 may not be as well known as the mighty @entity50 to the west and the wildlife - packed @entity52 to the east , but it 's no less exciting
get there by bush plane from @entity68 and immediately meet *majestic* beasts
nothing beats getting up close and personal with wildlife from horseback
ol @entity87 is a quirky mix of modern cool and @entity150 detail
