he worked at the @entity18 in the country 's capital			1
initial reports suggested all three recipients of the drug had responded well after receiving the drug on august 13			1
but dr @entity0 yesterday took a turn for the worse , the country 's information minister @entity25 told @entity29			1
two @entity30 , dr @entity31 and aid worker @entity32 , received the untested drug and survived			2
but a @entity35 missionary infected with @entity12 died after receiving the treatment - and there has been no update on the two other @entity4 who took doses of it			1
@entity12 has killed more than 1,400 people across @entity43			2
there is no proven vaccine or cure for the disease that can cause a grisly death with bleeding from the eyes , mouth and ears			0
the virus can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or from touching victims ' bodies , leaving doctors and other health care workers most vulnerable to contracting it			0
the first @entity62 victim , nurse @entity61 , is now being treated in an isolation unit in @entity65 's @entity64			1
the 29 - year - old had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic in @entity68 where other nurses had died from @entity12 or were too scared to come into work			1
mr @entity61 last night arrived back to @entity65 after being airlifted in an isolation sack for treatment at the north @entity65 hospital			1
last night the @entity74 started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus - @entity8			2
the drug had never been tested on humans , although an early version had been found to work in some ebola - infected monkeys			1
it is aimed at boosting the immune system 's efforts to fight the disease			1
only five people in the world are known to have received the drug and @entity90 , the @entity30 company behind it , says stocks are exhausted			0
it is expected to be months before more can be produced by its @entity30 maker			0
health experts caution that the drug had never been tested in humans before and it was unclear whether it works			2
they also say there is a huge gap between the treatment the two @entity30 got at an @entity104 hospital , where five infectious disease experts and 21 nurses provided rigorous care , and @entity43 , where even such basics as sterile fluids can be in short supply			0
earlier today , @entity112 officials said they were ready to provide an anti-flu drug as a potential treatment to the deadly disease			1
a @entity4 army soldier assigned to the @entity117 enforces a quarantine in @entity119 , @entity4			0

to date , the disease has killed more than 1,400 people across @entity43 there is no proven vaccine or cure for the @entity12 , which causes bleeding from the eyes , mouth and ears			1
the virus can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or from touching victims ' bodies , leaving doctors and other health care workers most vulnerable to contracting it			0
in rural @entity119 , residents are relying on food donations experimental serum @entity8 was created from a combination of antibodies in january			2
until the drug was given to the @entity30 ebola sufferers , it had only been tested on monkeys			2
it is unclear exactly how it works but both dr @entity31 and @entity32 recovered from @entity12 after receiving the serum			2
it is only available in limited supplies as larger scale human testing is needed to prove it safe and effective			0
the companies behind the drug , @entity8 and @entity167 are currently working to have the product approved and the production accelerated			2
the companies said in a statement : ' it is important to note that the emergency use of an experimental medicine is a highly unusual situation			0
' as a consequence global high - level discussions concerning the policy , ethical , and medical implications of this exceptional situation have been initiated			2
' chief cabinet secretary @entity180 said @entity112 may respond to emergency individual requests for the favipiravir tablet , before any official decision by the @entity184			1
the drug , developed by a subsidiary of @entity187 to treat novel and re-emerging influenza viruses , was approved by the @entity112 health ministry in march			2
it is available at any time , at the request of @entity184 , officials said today			1
@entity8 , an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients , has shown promising results , apparently aiding the recovery of two @entity30 missionaries who contracted the virus			2
a source at the @entity202 said : ' we are working with our international partners to source remaining doses for the patient			0
' the @entity184 said earlier this month that it is ethical to use untested drugs on ebola patients given the magnitude of the outbreak			1
@entity187 spokesman @entity212 said ebola and influenza viruses are the same type and theoretically similar effects can be expected on @entity12			0
he said the drug has also proved effective in lab experiments on mice			0
@entity221 said it has favipiravir stock for more than 20,000 patients			0
the company is also in talks with the @entity227 on clinical testing of the drug in treating @entity12			2
@entity230 is one of only a few drugs that may work on ebola			0
several drugs are being developed for ebola treatment			0
but they are still in early stages and there is no proven treatment or vaccine for the highly fatal disease , and @entity187 's drug is one of only a few new drugs that may work on ebola			1
@entity230 inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent propagation , while conventional ones are designed to inhibit the release of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection , the company said			0
mr @entity61 is the only @entity253 to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory			1
the only other @entity62 case was in 1976 , when scientist @entity256 pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus			0

critics argue there is a huge gap between the treatment the two @entity30 got at an @entity104 hospital , where five infectious disease experts and 21 nurses provided rigorous care , and @entity43 , where even such basics as sterile fluids can be in short supply a @entity4 army soldier assigned to the @entity117 enforces a quarantine in @entity119 a @entity4 @entity279 worker checks people for @entity12 symptoms at a checkpoint near the international airport			1
the disease has claimed more lives in @entity4 than any other country health officials last night said mr @entity61 was ' not seriously unwell ' â€“ a factor which will significantly boost his chance of survival			1
most patients die of ebola because of dehydration , when their blood vessels break down and their major organs fail			0
but fit , young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly improved chance of survival			0
if they are hydrated and the bleeding controlled , their immune systems can in some cases kick in , and defeat the virus			0
the @entity184 has put the number of people infected with the deadly ebola virus at 2,615			2
some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in @entity308 in march , before spreading to @entity68 , @entity4 and @entity309			1
male nurse @entity61 , 29 , was airlifted back to @entity65 after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in @entity68 rigorous quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of ebola , as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with sufferers			1
symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			0
this is followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function and , in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			0
the effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection			0
it is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person - to - person transmission			0
the @entity184 said the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people , and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids			1
the @entity356 ( @entity356 ) issued updated travel advice last week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to @entity68 , @entity308 and @entity4			0
' general medical facilities throughout @entity68 are currently under severe strain due to the @entity12 outbreak , and unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the @entity62			1
' dedicated healthcare facilities for @entity12 are overwhelmed , ' the @entity356 warned			0
the @entity68 parliament has voted to pass a new law which means anyone caught hiding an @entity12 patient can receive prison terms of up to two years			1
some 910 cases have been recorded in the country - and 392 deaths - but the @entity184 believes the magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are hiding infected friends and family in their homes			1
the @entity184 reported that corpses are being buried in rural villages without notifying health officials and with no investigation of the cause of death			2
in some instances epidemiologists have travelled to villages and counted the number of fresh graves as a rough estimate of suspected cases .			0

dr @entity0 was given drug on august 13 along with two others and ' responded well '
but officials today confirmed the deputy chief medical doctor at the the country 's largest hospital in @entity3 had died
@entity8 is said to boost the immune system , helping to fight deadly disease which has so far claimed 1,400 lives
but critics argue it has never been tested on humans - and the only *success* had been in monkeys with @entity12
the @entity184 says it is ethical to use experimental drugs given scale of the outbreak
comes as the first @entity62 victim , nurse @entity61 , 29 , was airlifted back to the @entity62 from @entity68
mr @entity61 arrived back to @entity65 in an isolation sack and was transferred to a special unit at @entity64
