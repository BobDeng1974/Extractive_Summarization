a free school which has received more than £ 3million in government funding has attracted just 11 new pupils this month , it has emerged			1
the @entity8 , in the @entity5 area of @entity6 , @entity7 , opened with just eight pupils in march and now has less children across two year groups than many secondary schools have in a single class			1
it has prompted teaching union officials to question why public money has been put into a scheme ' which is in such low demand ' at a time when the city is facing a school places crisis			1
the @entity8 , in the @entity5 area of @entity6 , @entity7 , opened with just eight pupils in march and now has less children across two year groups than many secondary schools have in a single class @entity26 , the @entity28 branch secretary in @entity6 , said : ' it is not just that this is such an awful waste of public money - which i think it is because there is so little demand for it - but it 's that this is taking place against the backdrop of a city which is having to work hard to find the resources to create new places and which is facing major shortages in the primary school sector which will work up to secondary schools over time			1
' however the school 's headteacher @entity47 said there was a larger cohort of @entity52 pupils in the primary school system and said the secondary school expected its numbers to increase ' significantly ' over time			1
he said that starting any new school was challenging and claimed the free school should not be judged on whether it has achieved value for money over two years but over the next ten years			2
he also said that before the free school opened , parents were having to send their children to @entity62 in order to receive a @entity52 secondary education			2
he said this was ' unacceptable '			0

however , the school 's capacity is only for 25 pupils per year meaning it is already almost half full			0

currently around 60 per cent of the secondary school 's pupils are @entity52			0

a spokesman said : ' free schools are a crucial part of our plans to help young people fulfil their potential and succeed in modern @entity116			0
' once fully up and running , @entity8 will deliver 175 high quality secondary school places			2
