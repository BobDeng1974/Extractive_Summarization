drinking a can of energy drink is enough to give a child caffeine poisoning , a leading doctor has warned			1
in the past three years , more than 2,000 children under the age of six were taken to hospital in the @entity8 suffering from the effects of the popular drinks , a study has revealed			2
their symptoms included serious cardiac problems – including abnormal heart rhythms – or neurological problems such as seizures and fits			1
a can of energy drink could poison a child and a 250ml can of @entity21 , which contains 80mg of caffeine , and a 500ml can of @entity23 , which contains 160mg of caffeine , are well over the limit for a child professor @entity28 , paediatrician - in - chief at @entity29 in @entity30 , said most cans of energy drink contain enough caffeine to cause a child potential harm			1
‘ exposure to energy drinks is a continuing health problem , ’ he will tell the @entity35 at a meeting in @entity37 today			0
‘ you normally think of teens and young adults as most likely to drink them , but we found that half of calls to @entity8 poison control centres involved unintentional exposures by children less than six years old			1
’ high - caffeine energy drinks in the @entity52 carry labels on their cans warning they are not suitable for children or pregnant women - but few retailers actively stop children buying the cans			2
professor @entity28 will say : ‘ energy drinks have no place in paediatric diets , and anyone with underlying cardiac , neurologic or other significant medical conditions should check with their healthcare provider to make sure it ’s safe to consume energy drinks			1
’ the doctor said a child under 12 could be poisoned if they consume more than 2.5mg of caffeine for every kilogram of their body weight - enough to make most energy drinks potentially dangerous to children			2
professor @entity28 said most cans of energy drink contain enough caffeine to cause a child potential harm his calculations mean 50mg of caffeine in a day is enough to poison an average six year old			1
a child aged 10 could get caffeine poisoning after drinking 80mg and a 12 - year - old might be poisoned after 100mg			2
a 500ml can of @entity23 contains 160mg of caffeine - well over the limit			0
a 250ml can of @entity21 contains 80mg of caffeine			0
young children , especially those with diabetes or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , may be particularly at risk , he said			0
by professor @entity28 ’s calculations , a mug of coffee also contains enough caffeine - at 100mg - to cause youngsters harm			1
a single 330ml can of @entity107 , meanwhile , contains 32mg , making it safe in moderation			0
professor @entity28 said energy drinks may contain pharmaceutical - grade caffeine and additional caffeine from natural sources that may cause the heart to race and blood pressure to increase			1
energy drinks with multiple caffeine sources may have higher rate of side effects , typically involving the nervous , digestive or cardiovascular systems			0
he said many of the added ingredients in energy drinks have never been tested for safety in children - meaning the caffeine may not be solely to blame			0
‘ the reported data probably represent the tip of the iceberg , ’ he said			0
‘ this has no place in the diet of children and teenagers , and it should n’t be marketed at all to those under 18 , ’ ‘ if the goal is to try to protect the public ’s health , then these should be regulated similar to tobacco , alcohol and driving , so you have fewer kids winding up in the hospital or intensive care			0
