@entity2 is demanding the @entity13 select committee withhold the list while he conducts a criminal investigation over potential breaches of data protection laws			1
but the committee gave the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) an ultimatum to publish the list or the @entity4 would do so			1
their deadline passed last night without @entity19 taking any action			1
mps on the committee were ready to publish the dossier , but have delayed after objections from police and mr @entity2 , who will appear before mps this afternoon after he was summoned late on sunday night by committee chairman @entity29			1
they will want to probe his claim that they could scupper the investigation by publishing the list of 98 names compiled by the @entity19			1
the number had been thought to be 102 but when @entity19 handed the list to the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , several names were withheld which are the subject of a separate @entity42 investigation			1
at least 33 names from the list have already leaked out , including that of x factor creator @entity46			0
blue - chip firms also understood to feature include banking giant @entity48 , accountancy firm @entity49 as well as insurance company @entity50			0
last week , mr @entity29 said it was in the ‘ public interest ’ to name the firms and individuals who have paid private detectives convicted of corrupt practices			0
however , mr @entity2 has insisted doing so could undermine his investigation			2
in a blog post on sunday he wrote : ‘ it ’s not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you ’re investigating			1
’ @entity29 ( left ) said last week it was in the ' public interest ' to name the firms who have paid private detectives convicted of corrupt practices			0
at least 33 names have already leaked out including @entity46 ( right ) he said it was ‘ not fair ’ those on the list could learn of their inclusion from a committee of @entity4			2
he added : ‘ we have to start from the central principle of @entity81 justice that some of the 98 may not have broken any law			0
' the criminal offence associated with “ unauthorised disclosure ” of personal information depends on the prosecution establishing that the clients knew that the information they were seeking would be , or could only be , obtained by unlawful means			0
that will be central to the @entity38 ’s investigation			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s office was belatedly handed the list by @entity19 at the end of august after weeks of pressure			1
the @entity38 is to write to the celebrities , law firms , banks and other companies to ask them what they knew about the activities of the investigators they were using			0
mr @entity2 said investigators will also have to examine more than 30 files generated by @entity107 , the @entity19 probe which resulted in the jailing of four rogue investigators last year			2
the existence of the list emerged during an investigation by the committee			0
@entity19 , dubbed ‘ @entity81 ’s @entity115 ’ , refused to publish it on the grounds it could breach privacy laws , and damage commercial interests			2
but critics claim nothing was being done about a scandal akin to newspaper phone hacking			0
@entity19 said it always intended to pass the list to the @entity38 once the @entity42 investigation was over .			2
