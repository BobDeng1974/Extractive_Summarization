with just over a week to go until the @entity0 hits her due date , preparations for the new arrival at her @entity5 home , dubbed ' @entity6 ' , have been heating up			1
@entity7 , the new arrival 's grandmother , has become a permanent fixture at the country home , while in the nursery , nanny @entity12 is preparing to welcome a second charge			2
but while much of the effort has focused on @entity16 and making sure he does n't feel left out , more still has gone in to giving the nursery a makeover			0
fittings for both are thought have come from luxury children 's furniture emporium , @entity34 of @entity35 , where @entity37 baskets start at £ 75			1
but in a curious twist , it is understood that @entity0 had several pots of pink paint delivered to @entity42 from the @entity43 store a couple of weeks ago			1
in a move certain to invite further speculation over the sex of the baby , among colours chosen was @entity49 , which is described as a ' beautiful rich complex pink with a hint of lilac			2
' another was @entity55 , a ' soft pale pink with a hint of brown ' that is redolent of ' old - fashioned roses and the colour of old plaster ' and the third , @entity62 , a ' warm soft aubergine colour with pink and red undertones '			2
home : the new baby will spend its first few weeks at his or her parents ' @entity5 home , @entity42 @entity72 pad : the new arrival will also have the run of a second nursery at @entity27 each pot comes with a price tag fit for a royal , with just one litre of the paint costing £ 18.95			1
@entity27 refused to comment on the story saying that they could neither ' confirm ' nor ' deny ' that the couple had plans to paint the nursery			1
echoing the palace 's line , a spokesman for @entity87 said the company could not ‘ confirm or deny ’ that it had supplied paints to @entity42			1
nonetheless , a pink nursery appears more likely than the @entity93 - themed one hinted at by @entity94 in an interview with @entity96			2
' i 'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room , ' he joked			0
' we 'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that , make him grow up as if he 's in the bush			0
' boy or girl ? @entity0 's pink coat and pink paints have fuelled speculation over the new baby 's sex compelling : @entity87 has supplied three feminine paint samples to @entity42 whatever the nursery 's eventual colour , more work still has gone in to turning @entity42 into a secluded property where @entity16 - and his new sibling - can enjoy a relatively normal childhood			1
the refurbishment , which has taken two years and cost £ 1.5 million , has seen new security features added to the ten bedroom property which also has a swimming pool , tennis court and extensive grounds			0
as part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof , a state - of - the - art kitchen and a conservatory – @entity94 had the driveway to the property , which used to belong to his close friends the @entity140 family , rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees			0
more money has been spent on filling the royal nursery and with both @entity147 known to have traditional tastes , it 's safe to say that that extends to the toy box			0
@entity16 has been cutting his teeth on old - fashioned wooden toys , while his reading material includes the @entity155 books - the first of which was published in the 1950s			1
toys for the new baby will be no exception and are likely to have a homespun wholesome feel much like this £ 34 @entity162			0
prepared : the @entity163 and @entity0 also have plenty of pieces left over from @entity16 traditional : the @entity163 and @entity0 have traditional tastes and prefer old - fashioned toys one for @entity155 : the couple were presented with a @entity170 and @entity171 box when @entity155 was born tally ho ! both royal children are likely to start riding as soon as they are big enough , much like the queen @entity0 , who has made no secret of her liking for traditional fittings such as @entity37 baskets , is also likely to follow suit when it comes to toy boxes			1
indeed , the couple already own one , having been gifted a £ 360 @entity170 and @entity171 toy box by 10 @entity184 following @entity16 's birth			2
another @entity170 and @entity171 piece likely to feature in the royal nursery is the company 's £ 550 rosewood rocking horse			0
@entity94 is a keen horseman and both @entity16 and the new baby will have no shortage of steeds to choose from when they get a bit bigger			0
indeed , the royal baby 's great - grandmother , the @entity174 , has been riding since the age of four when she was presented with a @entity200 pony named @entity201 .			0

@entity203 of @entity204 is due to give birth on the 25th april
new arrival will have the use of two nurseries , both *shared* with @entity155
one at @entity42 in @entity5 and a second at @entity27
*duchess* is thought to have ordered £ 18.95 pots of pink paint
