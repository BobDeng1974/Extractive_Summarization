by @entity0 these days we communicate most of the time by email and text , receive statements online and fax machines are already a thing of the past â€“ yet global paper consumption since 1980 has gone up by almost half			1
the worst offenders are the @entity12 , with the equivalent of 8.51 40 - foot trees worth of paper being consumed by each member of the population per year , according to @entity18			1
the magazine points out , however , that its position at the top of the tree - consumption tree is partly down to the @entity24 headquarters being there , which prints vast amounts of paperwork in countless languages			1
@entity29 you believe it ? @entity12 uses more than eight trees - worth of paper per person per year the @entity35 spot is filled by @entity36 , which apparently does convert a lot of its paper into domestic packaging , thereby distorting its tree consumption			1
the top next three worst offenders are @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 - despite all three having technology - driven economies			2
the rest of the top 10 is made up of the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
the @entity55 comes in at @entity56 , with each member of society using the equivalent of 4.48 trees			0
next in the chart comes @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , which only uses 1.81 trees per person			0
@entity69 is the most tree - friendly nation , with only 0.16 trees per person being used each year			0
paper recycling is certainly something that the @entity55 population feels strongly about with a marked increase in the amount recovered per household since 1997 .			2

the *biggest* paper consumer in the world is @entity12 , thanks to @entity24 *bureaucracy*
