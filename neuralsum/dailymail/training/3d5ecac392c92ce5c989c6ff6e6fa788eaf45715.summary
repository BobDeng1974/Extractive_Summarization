by @entity0 it was meant to be a light - hearted attempt to sell garden furniture			0
but advertisers working for the @entity6 furniture giant @entity5 clearly underestimated the sensitivities of @entity9 gnome lovers			1
when their tv campaign showed a line up of the garden ornaments being systematically destroyed they received dozens of angry complaints			1
angered at plans to eradicate them from the garden , the gnomes launch a revenge attack			1
but they are thwarted by the couple – who find increasingly violent ways to kill them off			1
some are shattered into thousands of pieces by a well - aimed jet from a power hose while others are gathered in a hammock and smashed against a garden fence			0
one scene sees a heartbroken gnome standing over a fallen friend with a tear running down his cheek			0
the ad finishes with the tagline : ‘ make more of your garden			0
’ the gnomes rebel against the new additions at the married couple 's home in the @entity5 advert viewers complaining about the advert have said it is ' unsuitable for children , offensive , frightening , violent and encourages anti-social behaviour ' however the company found themselves on the end of an unlikely backlash – after affronted viewers picked up the phone to criticise the ‘ violent ’ attack			1
around 50 people rang the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) to complain about the ad ’s ‘ frightening and unsuitable ’ content			1
an @entity19 spokesman said they realised some people found the images distressing			2
however he said the @entity19 would not be taking further action			2
‘ we do not share the view that it would encourage violence , condone anti-social behaviour or upset children , ’ he said			0
last night dr @entity87 , a garden gnome expert , said : ‘ gnomes have always played a large and happy part in populating our green spaces			2
‘ people like to make out that they ’re naff and tacky , but they are a lucky charm , which are now loved worldwide			0
' the advert was bound to cause uproar			0
after all , we are a nation of gnome lovers			0
if i were @entity5 i ’d be worried			2
beware the revenge of the little folk			0
’ @entity5 ’s marketing manager @entity101 said : ‘ we believe that the advert takes a light - hearted approach			1
‘ we can confirm that no gnomes were harmed in the making of the advert , thanks to clever @entity109 post-production and some brave stunt doubles			2
’ @entity5 has said the advert takes a ' light - hearted approach ' to show how easy it is to treat gardens like any other room in the home the @entity6 furniture giant has said it ensures its adverts comply with the @entity119			1

@entity5 advert has prompted 50 complaints to @entity19
advert shows married couple finding ' violent ' ways to kill off gnomes
