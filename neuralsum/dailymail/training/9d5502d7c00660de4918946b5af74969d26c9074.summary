if the @entity0 deal to @entity1 does go through , i would applaud the @entity3 and @entity4 for any part they may have had in making this happen			1
it sends out a strong message that , in this @entity12 season , @entity10 will not compromise			1
there will be no ‘ what - ifs ’ or excuses			0
@entity10 will do everything they can to win the @entity12			1
if you do that , and ultimately there is disappointment because it does n’t quite work out , there can be no regrets			0
everybody needs to be available and the coaches must select from maximum strength			0
@entity0 will be allowed to represent @entity10 at the @entity12 if he seals a move to @entity1 @entity10 coach @entity4 refuses to pick overseas - based players because of @entity3 policy click here to read the latest on @entity0 's proposed move to @entity1 as this story has unfolded i found it totally unacceptable that potentially we could have been facing a situation in which @entity0 was not only unavailable for @entity10 selection but could even line up against them for @entity37 in a big @entity12 game ! the truth is @entity0 may not get picked as an @entity10 starter — he is going to find it very tough — but a player of his quality has to be in the squad pushing hard for selection , challenging all the others			1
the dynamic in a squad when you have two or three class players pushing for every spot is brilliant , everybody has to step up and find a new level			0
it also means that coaches and those selecting the team have to really sharpen their pencils and be ruthless			2
the @entity10 back row is very competitive , make no mistake , and is packed with a number of versatile players , not least the skipper @entity62			1
he can play right across the back row while @entity0 can play openside or no 8 , which is where @entity65 often field him			1
all sorts of options could come into play			2
@entity0 played in the @entity69 for @entity70 before upping sticks and moving to @entity37 with @entity65 the flanker , pictured here at @entity73 in 2013 , wants to return to play for @entity10 at international level @entity0 is expected to play in @entity75 this weekend , meaning he will not move to @entity1 having made the effort to get @entity0 back home i see no point in hanging around and insisting on some sort of probation period			1
this is not the time for niceties			0
if the deal goes through by the weekend , i would put him straight into the senior squad which is announced next wednesday and make sure he gets a certain amount of game time this autumn			0
equally , if @entity90 had been available i would have thrown him straight into the action this autumn			0
although that ca n’t happen now i would get him involved with the squad as soon as he is permitted to travel back home after his surgery			0
i can only see one downside to @entity0 ’s return and it is more a matter of long - term principle than a short - term problem			1
there is absolutely no doubt that he has improved massively since he was last capped by @entity10 in 2010 when he was with playing with @entity70			1
he was a raw talent then , a more than useful player , but he did n’t look like a genuine @entity10 back - rower to me			2
we should never forget that playing for @entity65 has been the making of @entity0			1
they have found a way of getting him fitter , developing his game and integrating him into the team , so much so that he became the @entity114 player of the season			0
that is one of the reasons i remain convinced that the ‘ free market ’ should still be allowed			0
i see no reason why a player looking to better himself should n’t ply his trade an hour away in @entity37 and still be eligible for @entity10			2
there will also be a certain amount of dislocation if and when @entity0 returns , and that ’s probably not ideal			2
but to make such a move shows that his motivation to contest for a @entity12 spot must be very high .			0

the @entity65 flanker has been linked with a move to @entity1
@entity0 must play in @entity10 if he is to be considered for the national team
@entity1 are yet to agree terms with @entity65 over *signing* @entity0
proposed deal is said to be nearly dead in the water
