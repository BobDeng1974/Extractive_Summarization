jilted husband @entity0 has turned the heartbreak of his divorce into a nice little profit by publishing a book full of ingenious ways to use his ex-wife 's wedding dress			1
@entity0 , 41 , was crushed when his wife of 12 years walked out in 2009 , taking all her possessions except the white silk gown			1
when he asked her to take the dress back , she refused and told @entity0 to ' do what the f * * * he liked with it '			1
here the dress is being used as a cape the dress being used as a @entity25 camouflage			0
@entity0 , 41 , was initially crushed when his wife walked out in 2009 , taking all her possessions except the white silk gown - but then he started using is pain for gain so he did - and for the last four years he has come up with a series brilliant ideas and filled a book with them			1
some of the best include a hammock , a superhero 's cape and even a boat sail and he has documented them all on his blog			1
@entity0 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ' the idea came up when i was having dinner with my parents , brother , and sister - in - law a little while after my ex moved out			2
' at dinner i explained to my family that she left the dress and asked them what i thought was a serious question - what do i do with it ? @entity0 , who lives in @entity41 , @entity42 , is shown here using his ex-wife 's wedding dress as a dog lead the wedding dress being used as a parasol			1
when @entity0 asked his ex-wife if she wanted the dress , she told him to ' do what the f * * * he liked with it - so he did ' my brother suggested i wipe my ass with it and my sister - in - law said there were probably 101 uses so we immediately took out a pen and paper and started brainstorming ideas			1
' when the mother of his two children walked out in 2009 , @entity0 was understandably gutted , but decided to use the abandoned wedding dress as therapy			1
with the help of his brother , he turned the dress into a dog toy , skipping rope and a footrest			1
here the dress is being used as a zombie bride costume - just one of the ingenious uses @entity0 came up with the dress being used as a hairdressing cloth ( left ) and to decorate the @entity91 ( right ) the dress being used as a dog pouch			2
@entity0 cleverly collated all his ideas in a book , published in 2010 then after coming up with more than 40 ideas , including using the tulle as a pasta strainer and the fabric as an excellent coffee filter , he collated them in a book			0
unsurprisingly , his exploits have not pleased his ex-wife , who has even said she hopes he seeks counselling to deal with his anger and resentment			0
@entity0 said : ' my wife hates it and thinks i am motivated by revenge - which is n't the case at all			2
' this honestly does n't have anything to do with her			0
' i did it for myself because i thought it would be fun and wanted to answer the question - what can be done with a once worn wedding dress ? ' the wedding dress being used as a sledge			2
@entity0 says his project was in no way motivated by revenge the dress being used as a golf club cleaner			0

after dating for a year and a half , they planned their wedding in just nine days and threw it in their backyard			0
he joked : ' she said earlier in our relationship that if it worked out and one day we were to be married , it would have to be a beach wedding and she would wear a bikini			0

' but in the end , she was brave and wore a dress			0
