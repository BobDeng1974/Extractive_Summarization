@entity7 said she spotted unknown vehicles turning up outside her home in @entity10 , @entity11 , after living at the house for just a few months			1
the 27 - year - old said she feared her young children could witness the nocturnal activity and so decided to put up a sign urging ' doggers ' to stay away from the area			1

she said : ' i looked out of the window and there was a car parked up and all of a sudden another turned up			0
' i could see clear as day what was going on inside , and i was disgusted			0
it was happening right outside my house while my young children were asleep inside			1
' what if they got up in the night and saw what was going on ? it ’s unacceptable in a residential area			0
' ms @entity7 initially put up a triangular ' no dogging ' sign along with the words : ' this is a child friendly area , not a dogging spot			1
' the sign went on to say : ' smile , you ’re on @entity46 , you ’re a filthy b * * * * * * ! ' family : ms @entity7 and her children @entity20 , five , @entity22 , three and @entity23 , two , moved into the home just a few months ago ms @entity7 said she was then forced to make another sign after the first one disappeared			1
she said : ' someone stealing it was n’t enough to put me off			2
' this time i got on a chair and stuck it in the same place but higher up so no - one could take it down easily			0
' the second sign reads : ' do not remove this sign			2
it is n’t hurting anyone			0
some people have no respect			2
if you do n’t like my way of discouraging this behaviour , do one ! ' ms @entity7 says she has now seen a dramatic reduction in unknown vehicles outside her home during the night			1
result : ms @entity7 says she has now seen a dramatic reduction in unknown vehicles outside her home during the night she said : ' i have n’t seen anyone since			2
i think they ’re scared so they ’re not coming back			0
they ’re probably embarrassed that they ’ve been seen			0
' as far as i ’m concerned they can find somewhere else to get up to this behaviour			0
' i ’m not the only one with children in the area – there are plenty of families on this road and we do n’t want our kids growing up seeing that going on when they ’re in the safety of their own homes			2
' let it be a warning to them , because i ’m keeping my eye on them and if i see anyone pulling up again , i ’ll be straight out there			0
