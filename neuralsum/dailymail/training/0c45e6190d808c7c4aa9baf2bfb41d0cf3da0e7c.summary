by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 17:26 est , 28 november 2012 astronomers have discovered a mammoth black hole containing as much mass as 17billion @entity4			1
the monster object is more than 11 times wider than the orbit of @entity7 , the eighth planet in our @entity9			1
it lies at the heart of a small lens - shaped galaxy called @entity15 , 220million light years away in the constellation @entity17			1
observations of the incredible quasar known as @entity35 may answer questions about how the mass of a galaxy is linked to its central black hole mass and why there are so few large galaxies in the universe			1
the black hole at @entity15 makes up an enormous 14 per cent of the galaxy 's mass. other black holes found at the centres of galaxies only account for around 0.1 per cent			1
black holes are formed from matter collapsing to the point where normal laws of physics break down			2
their gravity is so strong that space and time are distorted , and not even light can escape			2
describing @entity15 , lead scientist dr @entity58 , from the @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ' this is a really oddball galaxy			0
it 's almost all black hole			1
' this could be the first object in a new class of galaxy - black hole systems			1
' a description of the black hole , found by astronomers using the nine - metre @entity69 in @entity59 , appears in the journal @entity71			1
the discovery could change theories of how black holes and galaxies form and evolve , say the scientists			2
record breaker : an artist 's impression showing the material ejected from the region around the supermassive black hole in the quasar @entity35 +1939			1
this object has the most energetic outflows ever seen @entity86 has revealed how it has taken inspiration from the past for its spacecraft of the future			2
researchers from the space agency have tested a small prototype of a design for a nuclear - reactor engine that they hope could be used one day to power deep - space exploration probes			0
the proposed design is based on a @entity101 engine , which was first invented in the 19th century and uses hot pressurised gas to push a piston			0
and the space agency 's engineers also used used ' heat pipe technology , ' which was invented at @entity107 in 1963 , as part of the mechanism to power the engine			0
a team of @entity86 and @entity112 researchers has shown shown that a reliable nuclear reactor based on the old technology could be used in spaceships , according to a news release from the @entity117			0
the engine would use a 50lb nuclear uranium battery to generate heat that is then carried to eight @entity101 engines to produce about 500 watts of power			0
the test engine produced 24 watts , while deep - space probes normally require 600 to 700 watts			0
the experiment known as the demonstration using @entity126 , or @entity127 , is the first demonstration of a space nuclear reactor system to produce electricity in the @entity60 since 1965			0
the second black hole announced today was spotted using the @entity133 's @entity132 in @entity134 , @entity135 , which found the most energetic quasar outflow ever discovered			1
the rate that energy is carried away by the huge mass of material ejected is equivalent to two trillion times the power output of the sun. ' this is about 100 times higher than the total power output of the @entity146 galaxy — it 's a real monster outflow , ' said @entity148 , an associate professor of physics in @entity150 and leader of the research team			2
theorists have predicted energy flows of this magnitude , and simulations have suggested these outflows impact the galaxies around them , but it has all been speculation — until now			0
' for the last 15 years many theorists have said that if there were such powerful outflows it would help answer many questions on the formation of galaxies , on the behavior of black holes , and on the enrichment of the intergalactic medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium , ' professor @entity148 said			2
' this discovery means we can better explain the formation of galaxies			0
there are hundreds of people doing the theoretical side of the work			0
' they hypothesise outflows in their simulations , and now we 've found an outflow in the magnitude that has only been theorised in the past			2
' now they can refine their already impressive models and base them on empirical data			0
' quasars are light phenomenon produced as material falls into a black hole producing a huge amount of energy			1
the bigger the black hole , the bigger the quasar			1
the @entity146 , says professor @entity148 , is a big galaxy with a ' smallish ' black hole			1
the black hole at the heart of quasar @entity35 - 1939 is massive , estimated to be a thousand times heavier than the black hole in the @entity146			1
and while black holes are noted for pulling material in , quasars accelerate some of the material and eject it at high speed			0
the larger the quasar , the more material it can take , the higher speed it can accelerate it , and the further it can eject the material			0
every year , according to the team 's analysis , a mass of more than 400 times that of the sun is streaming away from the quasar at a speed of 8,000 kilometers per second - five times more powerful than the previous record holder			2
' i 've been looking for something like this for a decade , so it 's thrilling to finally find one of the monster outflows that have been predicted , ' professor @entity148 said .			0

monster object lies 220million light years away in the constellation @entity17
also found today was black hole at heart of most powerful quasar yet seen
