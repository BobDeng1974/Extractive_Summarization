@entity1 's pre-season campaign got off to a disappointing start as @entity4 's side began with a surprise 2 - 0 defeat to @entity7 at @entity8			1
the @entity10 champions , who gave debuts to summer signings @entity14 and @entity15 , looked out of sorts as the @entity18 side scored twice in the first half to seal a memorable victory			1
@entity21 gave the @entity23 winners the lead on 27 minutes , converting the rebound after @entity26 had saved his penalty following a foul by youngster @entity29			0
this meeting had been eagerly anticipated from the minute it became known @entity1 were travelling north to face @entity96 's side , who were similarly fresh from their own title conquest at the end of last season			1
the visitors have a trio of players still at the @entity104 and plenty more recovering from their exploits in @entity106 but @entity4 still sent out a fairly strong side to @entity108 which included summer signings @entity15 , their new goalkeeper from @entity41 and @entity14 , their much - vaunted Â£ 12m capture from @entity31 , while @entity112 winger @entity111 and @entity113 striker @entity86 took their usual places			1
they took time to grace the @entity8 surface the night before as fans from both sides rolled up to catch a glimpse of the @entity120 champions being put through their paces in the build - up to for this late afternoon kick - off			0
big impression : trialist @entity38 ( left ) scores @entity7 's second goal against @entity1 going nowhere : @entity1 midfielder @entity82 brings down @entity7 's @entity70 during the second half battle : @entity7 's @entity128 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity1 striker @entity88 ( right ) there were no prizes at stake for this pre-season encounter which had been billed the champions vs champions but the hosts were buoyed by taking a 27th minute lead			1
@entity21 was barged inside the box by @entity29 and wasted no time in stepping up to take the resultant spot - kick			0
his effort was saved by @entity26 but the former @entity142 and @entity143 man did enough to force home the rebound			0
then , on 37 minutes , @entity7 had the audacity to go even further ahead			0
this time @entity21 hooked a cross into the box where @entity38 was waiting to send a shot out of the reach of @entity26 with the aid of a deflection			0
@entity1 , not surprisingly , made nine changes at half - time , with another new signing , @entity83 , also getting his first taste of action since joining @entity4 's side			1
first team stars @entity32 , @entity87 and @entity80 all joined the action at the break , but none could help the visitors mount a second half comeback			2
in control : @entity7 's @entity60 ( right ) attempts to turn away from @entity1 winger @entity111 ( left ) @entity167 , the @entity7 substitute , even had a chance to make it 3 - 0 on 73 minutes as he beat the @entity1 offside trap , but his delicate lobbed effort flew just wide			2
city continue their tour of @entity18 with a game against @entity174 at @entity175 on friday evening before jetting off to the @entity176 for games against @entity171 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 .			2

@entity14 and @entity15 made their @entity1 debuts but lost
the @entity18 side scored twice in the first half to seal the win
