published : 13:03 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 13:05 est , 23 april 2013 machines with the ability to attack targets without any human intervention must be banned before they are developed for use on the battlefield , campaigners against ' killer robots ' have urged			1
the weapons , which could be ready for use within the next 20 years , would breach a moral and ethical boundary that should never be crossed , said @entity12 laureate @entity11 , of the ' @entity13 '			1
' if war is reduced to weapons attacking without human beings in control , it is going to be civilians who are going to bear the brunt of warfare , ' said @entity11 , who won the 1997 peace prize for her work on banning landmines			2
they 're here ! a robot in @entity27 at the launch of the campaign to stop killer robots			1
lethal armed robots which could target and kill humans autonomously should be banned before they are used in warfare , campaigners have said			0
weapons such as remotely piloted drones are already used by some armed forces and companies are working on developing systems with a greater level of autonomy in flight and operation			0
' we already have a certain amount of autonomy , ' said @entity46 , professor of @entity47 and @entity48 at the @entity49			0
' i think we are already there			0
' if you asked me to go and make an autonomous killer robot today , i could do it			1
' i could have you one here in a few days , ' he told reporters			0
but the technology is a long way off being able to distinguish between a soldier and a civilian			0
' the idea of a robot being asked to exercise human judgment seems ridiculous to me , ' @entity46 told @entity66			2
' the whole idea of robots in the battlefield muddies the waters of accountability from my perspective as a roboticist , ' he added			0
@entity74 2 : @entity75 today lreleased this picture of expedition 35 flight engineer @entity77 with a humanoid robot being tested in the @entity79 onboard the @entity81 - orbiting @entity80			1
the weapons , which could be ready for use within the next 20 years , would breach a moral and ethical boundary that should never be crossed , said @entity12 laureate @entity11 , of the ' @entity13 '			1
the @entity86 government has always said it has no intention of developing such technology			1
' there are no plans to replace skilled military personnel with fully autonomous systems , ' a @entity90 spokesman told @entity66			2
' although the @entity96 does have defensive systems , such as @entity98 , which can be used in an automatic mode to protect personnel and ships from enemy threats like missiles , a human operator oversees the entire engagement , ' the spokesman added			0
but the organizers of the @entity13 to stop killer robots say @entity86 's rejection of fully autonomous weapons is not yet watertight			1
' we 're concerned that there is a slide towards greater autonomy on the battlefield and unless we draw a clear line in the sand now , we may end up walking into acceptance of fully autonomous weapons , ' said @entity117 , director of non-governmental organization @entity118			2
rapid advancements in technology have allowed countries such as the @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 to move towards systems that will soon give full combat autonomy to machines , according to a report by @entity131			2
' we think that these kinds of weapons will not be able to comply with international humanitarian law , ' @entity135 , @entity131 executive director , told @entity66 .			0

@entity86 expert *claims* he could make autonomous killer robot today
@entity140 says machines could be in *widespread* use in 20 years
