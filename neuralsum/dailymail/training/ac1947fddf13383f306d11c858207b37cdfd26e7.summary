by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 17:15 est , 30 september 2013 it may only be the size of a matchbox , but it could pose a big threat to our native wildlife			0
a baby terrapin spotted in a @entity8 canal has sparked fears among conservationists that they may have been breeding during the hot summer			1
their natural habitat is the hot , humid swamps of the @entity15 , so @entity8 waters are normally too cold for them to breed			1
but the @entity17 says this year ’s scorching weather could have provided ideal conditions for the reptile to multiply – which it says would be ‘ a disaster ’ for wildlife			1
' disaster ' : the baby terrapin spotted in @entity25 suggests there could have been a surge in breeding in the wild , the reptiles eat native species such as frogs , fish , and ducklings			1
the charity said the young terrapin was discovered last week in @entity25 near @entity37 , @entity38			1
it is urging people to report any other sightings to establish whether they are breeding			1
the popularity of terrapins as pets peaked during the late @entity45 and early @entity46 thanks to the hit children ’s tv cartoon series , the @entity51			2
but many were dumped in rivers and canals after growing too big for the fish tanks in which they were kept			2
the @entity56 banned the importation of terrapins to member states in 1997 over concerns of their impact on indigenous species when released into the wild			1
@entity63 : experts warn the creatures eat frogs , fish and ducklings			1
more terrapins could affect the wildlife @entity71 : the @entity56 banned the importation of terrapins to member states in 1997 over concerns of their impact adults that have been freed by their owners can be seen in @entity8 inland waters , but it is highly unusual to see a hatchling			2
they can be kept as pets , but are only bred in captivity in @entity85			0
ecologist @entity86 , of the @entity17 , said : ‘ this could be bad news for conservation			0
' we ’ve been concerned that increasing temperatures associated with climate change would give terrapins the conditions they need to breed , something which could be a disaster for some native wildlife			1
‘ we ’ve heard anecdotal reports that eggs had been laid			0
' now we ’ve found this juvenile , the hunt is on to see if there are more , especially if they are displaying their egg teeth – a sign that they are recent hatchlings			2
’ he said towns and cities , which tend to reach higher temperatures in hot weather , were the most likely places to find any offspring , adding : ‘ @entity113 need extremely warm , sustained weather , something we obviously experienced over the past few months			0
‘ it ’s particularly noticeable in towns and cities which can become “ heat islands ” in the summer – which could explain this finding			2
‘ we ’d be keen to hear from anyone who has spotted a match - box - sized terrapin			1
it would help us to determine that they are breeding			0
’ the baby was spotted by biology graduate @entity126 , who lives on a boat and has nicknamed it @entity129			0
he said : ‘ we have quite a lot of wildlife by the boats , including about 20 adult terrapins , but this juvenile really stood out			0
' you often see it basking on a piece of wood			0
i ’ve been looking to see any more , as it ’d be a sign of hatchings			0

conservationists warn terrapins eat ducklings , frogs and fish in the wild
