his eyes bulging and his mouth wide with panic , a starving squirrel stretches out a despairing arm as his nuts fall irretrievably to the ground			2
there 's not a human being alive that does n't know that desperate feeling of losing something of great personal value			2
and , as this picture shows , animals lose things too ... but it never gets any easier			2
the photograph was taken by keen amateur photographer @entity18 , 27 , outside his home in @entity20 , northern @entity21			1
nooooooo ! his eyes bulging and his mouth wide with panic , a starving squirrel stretches out a despairing arm as his nut falls irretrievably to the ground grooming : the day began so well as the rodent climbed to the top of the sun - soaked pylon for a spot of self - grooming before breakfast @entity18 , how works as development manager by day , said that his original intention was to shoot the sunrise , but then the squirrel caught his eye basking in the morning light			1
it was scurrying up and down an electrical pole outside his house before settling on its top to tuck in to breakfast			1
but as it opened its mouth to eat , it fumbled the treat sending it plummeting to earth , just as @entity52 took a picture			1
@entity18 said : ' it was a early morning and i wanted to shoot sunrise , but suddenly i saw the squirrel on top of the electrical pole			1
inconsolable : but after the squirrel dropped its prized food , @entity52 managed to capture the exact moment of despair nowhere to be seen : the squirrel searches the ground despairingly for his food acorn crazy : the picture is reminiscent of @entity68 , the saber - toothed squirrel from the @entity71 films , who keeps losing his acorn ' the squirrel was contentiously going up and down the electric pole , and then suddenly squirrel climbed on the top and started to eat something			1
this made me want to take pictures			0
' the squirrel had hold of some kind of nut , which he dropped			0
' when i saw the photo , i thought ' bingo ' - it was mindblowing			0
my friends all call me a real photographer now			0
' i really like squirrels			0
i think they look really innocent			0
