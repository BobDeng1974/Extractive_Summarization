when @entity1 claims he is playing the best football of his life , it is worth pausing to place it in context			1
this is @entity1 , the star of an attractive @entity8 side who passed and moved to the @entity10 final , a @entity11 who spent three years with @entity12 at @entity13 and who conquered the world with @entity16 in 2010			1
and , yet , in four months at @entity17 he already seems like he was born to be @entity19 ’s tempo - setter in a team committed to entertain and hell - bent on winning			1
@entity1 believes he is playing the best football of his career at @entity17 right now the @entity24 ( left ) passes the ball while being challenged by @entity27 's @entity26 on tuesday ‘ i feel in control and that ’s what i like the most in football , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i touch the ball all the time , i feel happy , i go and get the ball from here , from there , i can go forward , @entity35 drops deep			2
i feel free , i feel confident			0
‘ sometimes in the last three or four years in the national team and @entity13 , i was playing like a no 9			2
i mean , i have to do it for the team and i enjoy it , and it ’s all good			0
but , here , where i am playing today , in these games , it ’s where i enjoy my football the most			1
i feel right now i am playing some of the best football of my career			1
‘ i ’ve played in @entity52 finals , @entity50 finals , @entity10 finals with great teams			1
i ’m not saying the ( last two ) games against @entity54 or @entity27 were the best , probably they were n’t , but definitely they were games i enjoyed a lot			2
’ then the inner @entity19 kicks in			0
@entity1 has a winning mentality , a touch of devilment , perhaps a selfish streak , which is sure to appeal to his latest manager			2
@entity61 once again starred in an emphatic @entity17 win - they beat the @entity64 side 5 - 0 at the @entity65 the midfielder plays a dink pass into the penalty area during @entity17 's @entity10 victory ‘ i did n’t just come here to play well and that ’s it , ’ he said			1
‘ i came to win trophies			1
if i can play well and enjoy myself , the better			0
‘ we have to win trophies			1
no - one remembers a great , great team if you do n’t			2
we have to win and that will say a lot from us and people will judge it how they want to judge it			2
the most important thing is to keep it going and at the end of the season we can talk			0
’ @entity1 has yet to lose a game with @entity17			1
they are clear at the top of the @entity87 , safely into the last 16 of the @entity10 and are @entity89 quarter - finalists			1
@entity19 ’s team have barely offered a glimpse of weakness , from swatting aside @entity93 on the opening day to the destruction of @entity27 in @entity64 on tuesday			2
@entity96 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity1 ( left ) and @entity98 after @entity17 's second goal on tuesday @entity1 tries to run away from a tackle as @entity27 's @entity101 advances on top of him who can beat them ? how many trophies can they collect this year ? it is difficult to see who might stop them , but @entity1 said : ‘ we go on by not agreeing with the assumption			1
we know people say how great @entity17 is , how good they are playing , how we have won the title , but it is just not happening this way in the dressing room			1
‘ it ’s a long way to go , especially with the @entity119 period			0
we will play @entity120 and @entity121 away , you can drop points			0
why not ? it can happen			0
‘ this is the toughest league in the world			0
everyone else is having holidays , as i did in the last three years			0
trust me , it helps a lot			0
‘ it is not the same going into the @entity10 knockout stages after 10 days on holiday in @entity133 as it is playing every two or three days in the @entity87			1
we will have to cope with it			0
i believe we have the squad to cope with it , 100 per cent , no excuses			0
’ @entity17 celebrate on their way to a victory which sees them into the knockout stages as group winners @entity1 and @entity142 stirred controversy in @entity16 when they pulled out of international duty only to both be fit for @entity17 ’s 2 - 0 win against @entity54 on saturday			1
it prompted questions about commitment from some quarters , including @entity150			0
@entity1 called the @entity152 defender to set the record straight			2
‘ i have played 94 games for @entity16 , ’ said the 27 - year - old @entity17 midfielder			1
‘ i ’ve been going for nine years , always , and with a big smile			0
we spoke on the phone			0
i told him we have played together since @entity160 and there is no need for him to send messages through the press			0
i told him to call me up and say it to my face			0

@entity17 beat @entity27 5 - 0 at the @entity65 in the @entity10
@entity1 has yet to lose a game at @entity17 and has *flourished*
he believes he 's playing ' the best football ' of his career at @entity175
the @entity24 *insists* he moved to west @entity177 to win trophies
@entity1 says @entity17 must win trophies or they will not be ' remembered '
