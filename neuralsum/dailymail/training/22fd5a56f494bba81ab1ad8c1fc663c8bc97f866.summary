by @entity0 the look in his eyes and the emotional tone to his voice tells you the extent of the pain @entity8 feels about the ending of his history - making partnership with @entity11			1
the @entity13 champion described himself as ‘ gutted ’ that they will no longer be working together , after deciding they could not go on with an arrangement that was in danger of becoming ‘ half - baked ’			1

video : scroll down to watch @entity8 's journey under @entity11 gutted : @entity8 has revealed how his split with coach @entity11 has hurt him deeply separate ways : @entity8 ( @entity30 ) and @entity11 decided to end their relationship for fear it could become ' half - baked ' watchful eye : @entity11 ( r ) and @entity8 have worked together since 31 december 2011 at the @entity36 in january , the 26 - year - old compared the start of a player - coach relationship to having a new girlfriend : you might do everything you can to impress them in the first few months but let some effort slip when things become more familiar			1
to extend that analogy , it is clear that breaking up has also been very hard to do			2
the @entity47 no 1 appears to be suffering a degree of inner turmoil but that is hardly surprising when he has parted with someone who has changed his life			1
‘ that night it was tough , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ he was a big part of my life			2
we chatted for an hour about other stuff , then we chatted about moving forward			2
‘ the next couple of days for me on the court after that were not particularly fun , but he is going to come and watch my matches here			2
i was gutted but i still think the guy is great			1
it ’s not like anything has changed there			0
i will be disappointed for a few weeks but i need to try to move on			0
’ love game : @entity8 has compared his relationship with player - coach @entity11 to that of having a new girlfriend great scot : @entity8 insists that he will move on after the disappointment of losing a coach and friend mentor : @entity11 is still expected to be in @entity8 's box when he plays his first round at the @entity79 slightly strangely , @entity11 is expected to be in @entity8 ’s player box tonight when the @entity72 takes on @entity82 @entity81 in the second round of the @entity79 in what will be his first match since that fateful dinner last saturday			1
it is clear the situation with @entity11 has been troubling him for some time , with @entity8 wanting more time from the 54 - year - old @entity90 than he felt able , or willing , to give			1
‘ when there ’s a chance that something like that might not work out , or maybe something is going on , it can be in the back of your head , ’ the @entity72 conceded			0
‘ maybe thinking about these kind of things for a couple of months can throw you off a little			0
‘ we planned to sit down when i got to @entity105 to discuss moving forward , but it was n’t going to happen			0
he is a very hard person to replace , he made a huge difference to my tennis			0
the thing he was brought in to do was to help get me over the line and that ’s what he did			0
’ breakthrough : under @entity11 's guidance , @entity8 won his first major event by taking gold at @entity116 grand slam dunk ! @entity8 went on to win his first major at the @entity119 under @entity11 it is absolutely clear that @entity8 did not want it to end			1
he revealed that their agreement was for @entity11 to do 25 weeks per year with him in the first year , going down to 20 in the second			2
it was going to be less in 2014 , and he felt that was not enough			0
‘ @entity11 completely understands that as well , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ and that was why we decided to stop working together because it was n’t going to be of benefit to anyone doing the job half - baked			1
that ’s what @entity11 ’s like			2
he will do things properly , he does n’t want to do it halfway			0
’ @entity8 sounds somewhat down in the dumps			2
it is hardly what he needs as he prepares to defend his title here and the large haul of ranking points that goes with it , with the chance of dropping to no 8 if it does not go well			0
@entity147 : @entity8 celebrates after becoming the first @entity47 player to win @entity13 for 77 years the wait is over : @entity8 finally laid @entity151 's ghost to rest after beating @entity152 in the final stairway to heaven : @entity8 clambers up the stands to celebrate with @entity11 after winning @entity13 he conceded that he has not played as well over the past six weeks as he did at the @entity36 , even though in @entity156 he did not feel ‘ physically quite there yet ’ after back surgery in late september			1
there was also the admission that he has just been through a tough week in @entity161 , and that his overall form has been patchy of late			0
‘ who knows ? maybe it is the spark that i need , ’ said @entity8 , putting a brave face on things			2
‘ i have been in worse situations before and turned them around			0
i can see myself turning this around at some stage in the next couple of months			0
i know i will get myself up and play my best tennis in the @entity173 , i think my record in the last few years suggests that will happen			0
’ slow beginnings : @entity11 and @entity8 are the only players to have lost their first four @entity179 finals next ? @entity8 has hinted that he would like to bring in another former big - nam player to be his coach it sounds as though @entity8 , having enjoyed such success with @entity11 , would like another big - hitter who has experience of winning a @entity179 , but he is also aware that they are in short supply , especially those who are willing to spend weeks and months away			1
he stated that he intends to try and appoint a replacement before the @entity190 begins in late may			1
‘ it ’s a possibility for sure , but again the situation has to work for everybody and there are n’t that many guys willing to travel and make sacrifices , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t want to rush it , this has to be for the medium to long term			0
’ at least @entity8 is not the only one with coach issues — @entity202 will be absent from @entity152 ’s camp again because he has had to have more surgery on both his hips .			1
