the surge in popularity of unmanned , commercial drones has sparked serious air - safety fears in the @entity4 after an official report exposed 25 ' near misses ' with passenger planes in just the past five months			1
the @entity8 says commercial drones are filling the skies at an unprecedented rate and believes there could be as many as 7,500 such machines in @entity4 airspace within five years			1
but with regulation still in its infancy , drones are posing a new threat to aviation safety amid growing reports of ' close calls ' with passenger planes over some of the country 's busiest airports			1
in the way : the government is receiving reports nearly every day - and sometimes two or three times a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission danger : in one case last week , an unmanned drone flew ' under the nose of ' a flight landing at @entity39 in @entity40 ( pictured ) in one case last week , an unmanned drone flew ' under the nose of ' a @entity44 flight landing at @entity39 while the pilot of a @entity47 flight arriving in @entity49 airport two days earlier told the @entity8 he saw one hover within ten feet of his wing			1
on november 13 , an @entity53 @entity52 , arriving in @entity54 from @entity55 , reported a ' disk - like ' drone passing within 20 to 40 feet of the aircraft while at 3,000 feet			1
on october 12 , @entity59 's air traffic control tower reported an unspecified aircraft ' taking evasive action ' to avoid a small drone at 4,800 feet			1
the pilot said it had a camera attached to the bottom			0
and on september 30 , air traffic controllers reported that a red , black and yellow drone ' almost hit ' a @entity70 plane as it landed at @entity40 's @entity39			1
surge : while there have been 25 ' near misses ' in the past year , overall sightings of drones by pilots and air traffic controllers stand at more than 150 and have sharply risen in the past few months close call : two days earlier that the @entity39 incident , the pilot of another passenger plane told the @entity8 he saw one hover within ten feet off his wing over @entity49 in @entity40 on september 17 , a pilot of a @entity84 reported a drone with two red lights passing 200 feet overhead while at an altitude of 1,800 feet			1
' it came out of seemingly nowhere , ' he said in an interview , according to the @entity90			0
' if one of those things hits us , we 're coming down , ' he added			0
such close calls have also been reported in major airports in cities including @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 , @entity102 , among others and with online retailers such as @entity105 revealing plans to use unmanned drones to deliver packages the industry is set to boom			1
already drones are employed by film studios to film scenes from above and hunters to track their prey			0
it 's a sharp increase from just two years ago when such reports were still unusual			1
many of the reports are filed with the @entity8 by airline pilots			1
but other pilots , airport officials and local authorities often file reports as well , said the officials , who agreed to discuss the matter only on the condition that they not be named because they were n't authorized to speak publicly			1
growing trend : @entity128 launches a small drone equipped with a video camera to fly over the scene of an explosion that leveled two apartment buildings in the @entity135 neighborhood of @entity40 @entity136 , president of a drone industry trade group , said @entity8 officials also have verified the increase to him			1
while many of the reports are unconfirmed , raising the possibility that pilots may have mistaken a bird or another plane in the distance for a drone , the officials said other reports appear to be credible			2
the @entity8 tightly restricts the use of drones , which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine			2
small drones usually are n't visible on radar to air traffic controllers , particularly if they 're made of plastic or other composites			1
' it should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart , ' said @entity164 , a training captain at a major airline and a former @entity168 safety committee chairman			0
bird 's - eye view : a remote controlled model aircraft flies over the @entity172 spring training baseball workout in @entity173 , @entity174 ' so far we 've been lucky because if these things are operating in the sky unregulated , unmonitored and uncontrolled , the possibility of a close proximity event or even a collision has to be of huge concern			2
' the @entity8 requires that all drone operators receive permission from the agency , called a certificate of authorization , before they can fly their unmanned aircraft			2
most certificates limit drones to 400 feet in altitude and require that they remain within sight of the operator and at least five miles away from an airport			0
exceptions are made for some government drones			2
the military flies drones in great swaths of airspace in remote areas designated for military use			0
@entity202 flies high - altitude drones along the @entity4 borders with @entity205 and @entity206			2
in some cases the @entity8 has ' identified unsafe and unauthorized ( drone ) operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws , ' the agency said in a statement late tuesday			0
the @entity8 also said rogue operators have been threatened with fines			0
aviation safety expert @entity217 , a former @entity219 member , said he 's skeptical of some of the reports because most of the small drones currently being sold ca n't reach the altitudes cited by pilots			1
still , ' it needs to be run to ground			0
that means a real investigation , real work done to determine just what these reports mean , ' he said			0
more than one million small drones have been sold worldwide in the past few years , said @entity136 , the official with the drone industry group			1
it is inevitable that some will misuse them because they do n't understand the safety risks or simply do n't care , he said			0
' this technology has a phenomenal upside that people are still just trying to understand , ' he said			0
' as unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident , it 's not going to shut down the industry			0
' the @entity8 is expected to propose regulations before the end of the year that would allow broader commercial use of drones weighing less than 55 pounds			2
the @entity8 prohibits nearly all commercial use of drones , although that ban is being challenged			2
so far , the only commercial permits the agency has granted have been to two oil companies operating in @entity257 and seven aerial photography companies associated with movie and television production			0
but the ban has been ignored by many other drone operators , from real estate agents to urban planners to farmers who use them to monitor crops .			0
