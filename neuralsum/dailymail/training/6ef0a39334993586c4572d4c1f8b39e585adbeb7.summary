designer vaginas are ruining our idea of what real vaginas look like , researchers have warned women are getting increasingly distorted ideas of what their genitalia should look like , with many wrongly thinking their bodies are ' abnormal '			1
new research has found that those who looked at ' designer vaginas ' were more more likely to consider them ' normal ' and ' ideal ' when later comparing them to unaltered genitalia			1
airbrushing and waxing are two of the main reasons why women are becoming unhappy with their appearance , the researchers say			1
many also do n't realise how much appearances can vary , they add			0
the number of labiaplasties performed by the @entity26 has risen five-fold since 2001 , according to the study 's @entity28 authors			1
the surgery involves reducing the size of a woman 's labia minora to make them more symmetrical and smaller than the labia majora			0
' the rise in genital cosmetic surgery for women is a very worrying trend , ' the study 's lead author , @entity36 , from the @entity38 said			2
' there seems to be massive misconceptions around perceptions of normal genital appearance and i wanted to explore this further			1
' generally , there are no health reasons to have the surgery - it is only for the sake of appearance			1
so the researchers wanted to know what drives women 's perceptions of what looks good			2
ms @entity36 added : ' there are misconceptions around normal genital appearance			1
' this is due to airbrushing , lack of exposure to normal women 's genitals , greater genital visibility due to @entity70 and genital waxing and the general taboo around discussing genitals and genital appearance			1
' the results of the new study were published in @entity76 : an @entity77			0
ninety - seven @entity28 women ages 18 to 30 years old were divided into three groups			2
in the initial stage of the study , one group was shown almost three dozen images of modified female genitalia ; another group was shown images of unmodified genitalia			0
a third group was not shown any images			0
next , all three groups were shown a mix of images of modified and unmodified genitals and asked to rate them for the degree to which the vulva ' looks normal ' and ' represents society 's ideal			2
' researchers found that women who looked at ' designer vaginas ' were more more likely to consider them ' normal ' and ' ideal ' when comparing them to unaltered genitalia all three groups rated the images of the ' designer vaginas ' as more like society 's ideal than those which had n't undergone surgery			1
women who had viewed the images of the modified genitalia first also rated the modified vulvas as more ' normal ' than the unmodified genitals			1
but women who had seen the photos of unmodified genitalia first tended to rate them as normal in the second @entity114 researchers suggest that young women may not realize that normal genitalia vary considerably in appearance			1
' the reality is that when it comes to women 's genitals , as with other body parts , diversity is what is normal			2
the results demonstrate that exposure to one kind of image impacts women 's perceptions of normal , ' ms @entity36 added			2
@entity133 , co-author of ' @entity134 : a complete guide to the @entity136 and @entity137 ' , told @entity138 : ' it 's important to understand whether women are seeking elective genital surgeries because they want their vulvas to appear " normal " or because they want them to be consistent with an " ideal "			1
airbrushing and waxing are two of the main reasons why women are becoming unhappy with their appearance , the researchers say ' if they want to change their labia color , shape or size because they find them to be abnormal , concerns about potential variation may be addressed by showing women a variety of genital images , ' she added			1
' there a number of books , websites , posters and projects devoted to helping women " normalise " their genital appearance			1
if women are electing to have surgery in order to match a genital ideal , it may be more difficult to counter those women 's concerns			2
@entity175 , a clinical psychologist at @entity176 , added : ' [ these findings are ] especially disconcerting given that for many women , the narrow and unrealistic range of vulvas presented in mainstream @entity181 pornography may be the only images that they see , ' she said			0
' the vulva is unlike most other body parts , which remain visible even when clothed ; while a woman can look around and see the size and shape of other women 's waists , breasts , and so on , they do n't have the same opportunity to view other women 's vulvas and therefore are less likely to have a realistic sense of the natural diversity of vulvas in the female population			0
' @entity200 involves reconstructing the shape and size of the inner labia - and it 's now the third most popular procedure in the @entity206 , according to surgery search engine @entity208 the company has recorded a 109 per cent rise in enquiries about labiaplasty surgery over the last 12 months			0
@entity213 , a @entity214 spokesperson and surgeon at his practice @entity217 in @entity218 , said : '' about half of the patients i see in my practice want the operation for function , due to discomfort and problems with exercise , cycling and riding			0
the other 50 per cent want it purely for aesthetic reasons and to boost their self - confidence			0
' he added : ' i think these statistics reflect general trends in cosmetic surgery			0
in particular , they reflect a trend in my own practice			0
i have seen an even higher increase - one of more than 200 per cent in last 12 months			0
' in terms of ethics , people have to realise there is a rise and it 's difficult to determine why			0
i do n't think it has anything to do with the glamour industry			0
