by @entity0 last updated at 4:47 pm on 20th december 2011 the anti-government protestors in @entity2 have been caught up in a scandal that seems designed to split them after secret recordings of private phonecalls in which they attacked each other were posted on a pro-government website			1
in an echo of kgb - era surveillance , six hours worth of calls from opposition leader @entity10 were leaked to the website www.lifenews.ru			1
the website is part - owned by @entity14 , an ally of @entity15 , according to @entity2 media			1
opposition activists : @entity18 ( left ) was insulted by @entity10 ( right ) of the @entity19 - their differences over protest tactics were made public in six hours of secretly - recorded phonecalls angered : @entity10 wanted to organise @entity24 sanctioned protests , which led @entity18 to say he was in liege with the state the biggest protests of @entity15 's 12 - year rule , expressing anger at the debated election results which re-installed him as prime minister , were split into two camps			1
one group , led by @entity10 , advocated a legal protest that had been negotiated with the @entity2 government			1
another group , led by @entity38 , 35 , wanted to organise a protest in front of the @entity41 , without government permission			1
@entity10 believed that a legal protest would swell the ranks , with the addition of white - collar protestors who feared police clashes in an unsanctioned event			1
@entity18 said that @entity10 must in cahoots with the government			2
and according to the recordings @entity10 called her ' either a bitch , or an idiot '			2
thowing a curveball ? @entity2 's prime minister @entity15 , shown here at a school gym @entity58 , @entity59 , is an ally of the owner of the website - www.lifenews.ru - which published the calls man of action : @entity15 hummers a ' golden ' spike to start a construction of a new railway near the city of @entity69 in @entity59 , on another of his legendary publicity drives in the secretly recorded phonecalls @entity10 apparently said of @entity18 : ' she is a f * * * * * but what the hell can i do about it ? she does n’t f * * * * * * listen			1
' ' you are a f * * * * * * great @entity2 writer for f * * * * sake			0
can you call that @entity18 and tell that bitch that you are insulting @entity10 by accusing him of working for money			2
' in other comments , @entity10 derided supporters he was trying to muster for a rally as ' office plankton - chemical internet types ' who had never seen a riot policeman in their lives			2
@entity10 , a former cabinet minister who was once tipped as possible @entity41 leader during the rule of @entity95 , said the recordings had been heavily edited and partly falsified in an attempt by @entity15 ’s supporters to splinter the opposition			1
' parts of the recordings are genuine , part are heavily edited and parts are simply fake and falsified , ' said @entity10			1
@entity10 said the publication was an attempt by @entity15 and @entity41 acting chief of staff @entity106 to undermine a day of mass protests planned across @entity2 on december 24			1
electoral anger : the ongoing protests have been the biggest under the varying reigns of @entity15 and there is another major event planned for december 24 tactical disagreement : @entity10 's position was , he said , designed to attract to the protests white - collar workers who were afraid of being manhandled by police in an unsanctioned demonstration ' the aim of @entity15 and @entity106 is to prevent a mass meeting on the 24th and to split the opposition , ' he said			1
' they will not succeed : it will have the opposite effect and more people will come out			0
' @entity106 's office did not return a call for comment			0
a spokesman for @entity14 ’s @entity131 refused to say if there were any links between @entity14 and @entity134 , requesting written questions			0
@entity134 said it did not know of any links with @entity14 , who @entity137 says has a net worth of $ 1.5 billion			0
@entity10 said he had offered his apologies to @entity18 for his comments but that the publication had contravened his rights as a @entity2 citizen and his lawyers were working on getting a criminal case opened			2
in @entity2 , only state security services or their commercial cousins have the resources to carry out such extensive ' phone hacking ' so the recordings may also indicate the enduring influence of the secret police in @entity2 politics			2
@entity2 's secret police have long meddled in @entity157 politics , even coining the @entity2 word ' kompromat ' - or compromising material - to describe potentially damaging information used for blackmail			0
while @entity15 was head of the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) in 1999 , the security services were suspected of having a hand in the airing of a video purporting to show @entity2 's top prosecutor cavorting in bed with two women			0
@entity134 , which has delivered scoops such as the january 24 suicide bombing at @entity2 's biggest airport by building close contacts with the law enforcement agencies , did not say where it had got the recordings			0
@entity177 , the 22 - year - old chief executive of @entity178 which owns @entity134 , refused to say if he had got the recordings from the security services			0
' you as a reporter yourself know i can not disclose my sources , ' he said by telephone			0
' the cynicism of the opposition leaders is 10 on the @entity188 , ' @entity177 said on his twitter account			0
' dudes , in five years in show business i have never heard such an outrage			0
' he said he would publish more recordings .			0

opposition leader @entity10 had his phone tapped
he was caught in foul - *mouthed* rants against fellow protest organiser @entity38
@entity10 claims recordings are heavily - edited and / or fabricated and denies some of the content
recordings *surfaced* on website part - owned by ally of @entity15
