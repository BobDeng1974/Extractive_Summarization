that was n’t in the script : penalties , the @entity4 and a momentous anniversary looming — surely the only outcome could have been a @entity7 win ? not this time			1
here was a @entity9 first , @entity7 failing in a shootout , and that it happened at the scene of their greatest triumph thickened the plot			2
going out of the @entity15 at the hands of @entity17 was not how they aimed to mark 10 years since winning the @entity19			2
inevitably , it went to the wire and it took place at the same end at which they outwitted @entity26 in the 2005 @entity19 final			2
but when @entity29 thumped home @entity17 ’ fifth successful penalty , @entity28 wilted and sent his kick high and wide			1
@entity28 missed the 10th penalty as @entity7 crashed out of the @entity15 on thursday night to @entity17 @entity28 looks gutted as @entity35 club @entity7 crash out of the @entity15 against @entity17 on penalties @entity7 failed to repeat their 2005 @entity19 final heroics in @entity38 as they were dumped out of the @entity15 by @entity17 @entity17 players celebrate after they dump @entity7 in the @entity15 on thursday evening in @entity38 @entity28 looks gutted as @entity17 celebrate after he missed the final penalty of the shootout to see @entity7 lose 5 - 4 from the spot @entity7 manager @entity43 consoles his players after @entity28 was the unlucky man to miss from the penalty spot ‘ unfortunately , on this occasion , @entity38 is not a happy place , ’ conceded a crestfallen @entity43			1
with better finishing , it might have been			0
@entity7 had opportunities to build on the lead @entity52 had given them at @entity53 last week but lacked a killer instinct and it was their misfortune to run into a side , high on energy and fervour , that wanted to create history			1
it was never going to be a quiet night			0
with ticket prices reduced to attract a big crowd , the atmosphere had been building all day			0
thousands of home fans congregated at the site where their regular stadium is being redeveloped , and come 8pm local time , they were ready to play their part			0
yet as loud as the @entity71 made themselves , @entity7 ’s players never flinched			2
@entity17 had admirable endeavour but no star quality and it became apparent early on that mistakes — or a stroke of genius — would be the visitors ’ biggest foe			2
@entity7 's @entity52 accuses @entity17 's @entity79 of going down easy after a push by the @entity35 striker @entity52 yells at @entity82 on thursday evening during their @entity15 tie between @entity7 and @entity17 in @entity38 @entity52 eventually received a yellow card for persistent fouling during @entity7 's @entity15 tie in @entity38 against @entity17 @entity87 of @entity17 has words with @entity52 of @entity7 during the feisty @entity15 second leg match @entity17 fans chant as @entity52 walks past at the @entity15 match in @entity38 on thursday evening @entity17 : @entity92 7 , @entity93 6 , @entity94 7 , @entity79 6 , @entity95 7 , @entity96 7 , @entity87 7 , @entity97 7 , @entity98 6 ( @entity29 61 , 8 ) , @entity99 7 ( @entity100 105 , 6 ) , @entity101 6.5 subs not used : @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 goals : @entity29 ( 72 ) bookings : none manager : @entity112 7 @entity7 : @entity113 7 , @entity114 7 , @entity28 7 , @entity115 7.5 , @entity116 6.5 , can 8.5 , @entity117 7 , @entity118 6.5 , @entity119 6 ( @entity120 76 , 5 ) , @entity121 5.5 ( @entity122 106 ) , @entity52 6.5 ( @entity123 82 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 bookings : @entity52 , can manager : @entity43 7 referee : @entity132 ( @entity133 ) 7 attendance : 55,000 @entity135 : @entity136 earlier in the season , you would not have put any money on @entity7 holding their nerve but they have turned things around impressively and with the defence working smoothly it became a question of whether they could score to kill the tie			1
they had enough chances to do so before the break as @entity52 and @entity121 — a pairing @entity43 had started with only once before — began causing problems for @entity17 with power and running			1
@entity52 was in the thick of the action straight away , jostling with @entity79 and picking up a booking for a lunge at @entity87 , but this was n’t an erratic display and the deft pass he produced to send @entity121 through should have produced the first goal on 33 minutes			1
@entity116 and @entity118 had both gone close but neither had the time and space @entity121 was afforded when @entity52 ushered him through			1
much to @entity43 ’ frustration , however , he wanted to take the shot with his left foot and that allowed @entity17 to scramble the danger away			2
@entity121 was involved again moments later , this time exchanging passes with @entity116 on the edge of the area , but the wing back succeeded only in shooting straight at @entity92 , who comfortably clung on to the drive			2
@entity17 offered little in response			0
for all that @entity112 hopped around his technical area , frantically trying to provide some inspiration , the closest they came to finding a breakthrough before half - time was a tame effort from @entity99 that @entity113 easily gathered			0
everything , it seemed , was going to plan for @entity7 and the game followed a similar pattern when they emerged after the interval			2
though the onus was on @entity17 to be creative and clever , all they offered were speculative attempts from @entity95 and @entity98			0
but there was one key difference			0
@entity7 ’s intensity as an attacking force dwindled and , gradually , they started dropping deeper and deeper			2
@entity112 , who was like a coiled spring , sensed there might be an opening and he made a change , sending on @entity29 for the tiring @entity98			0
within 12 minutes of his introduction , @entity29 dramatically changed the balance of the tie , dispatching a glorious left - foot drive beyond @entity113 after @entity97 and @entity101 created an opening for him 20 yards out			1
the stadium erupted as it curled inside the post			0
there is no question it stunned @entity7			0
they looked groggy and were almost knocked out cold in injury time when @entity101 smashed a shot against the woodwork from eight yards , the chance coming after @entity29 slalomed beyond three challenges to win a corner			1
@entity29 ( right ) scores the goal that put @entity17 1 - 0 up on the night after @entity101 ( second from right ) provided the assist @entity17 's @entity29 ( right ) runs away in celebration after scoring the opening goal of the @entity15 round of 32 second leg tie @entity17 took the lead in the 72nd minute through @entity29 as they looked to dump @entity7 out of the @entity15 on thursday night @entity29 of @entity17 is swamped by his team - mates after scoring against @entity7 to send the game into extra time @entity17 's @entity99 ( left ) and his team - mates celebrate their goal against @entity7 on thursday night in @entity38 @entity17 goalkeeper @entity92 celebrates after his team scored during the @entity15 round of 32 second leg match @entity7 went 1 - 0 down against @entity17 in the second leg as the game went to extra time in the @entity15 tie it was only the third penalty shootout defeat in @entity7 ’s history — they also lost to @entity234 in 2010 and @entity235 in 1993			1
extra-time at least enabled @entity43 to work on his squad but that did not halt the shift in momentum			0
@entity7 looked spent up front and the first 15 minutes became a test of endurance			1
@entity113 , in particular , excelled , standing firm when @entity17 threatened			0
a figure of derision not so long ago , he was comfortably @entity7 ’s top performer and it became inevitable , as @entity17 started to run out of ideas , that the @entity248 would become the main character in the final reckoning			1
ultimately , he could n’t reprise @entity252 ’s role and , for this season , the @entity9 adventure has no happy ending			0
the task now is to make sure they have @entity257 to look forward to next year			0
all these years after the @entity71 fans welcomed @entity260 clubs to hell , and they still put on quite of a show for their visitors			0
thousands had massed inside the @entity4 fully two hours before kick - off and a cacophony of boos and whistles greeted the @entity7 players when they emerged in their tracksuits to sample the atmosphere 90 minutes before the start			1
@entity7 landed back on @entity273 in the early hours of friday morning confident of escaping any punishment from @entity257 over @entity276 regulations			0
the club have made substantial losses in the last two years , but it is understood that @entity257 accept the next financial figures will show a small profit and that @entity7 are on course to make an even bigger one the following year			0
@entity17 issued an apology to @entity7 fans after some were left stranded in the centre of @entity38 , 90 minutes ’ drive from the stadium , when their pre-arranged transport failed to turn up			1
@entity7 complained to the @entity71 club and issued a statement saying : ‘ @entity17 have responded by offering a full apology to those supporters affected by the disruption			1
’ after finishing last week ’s first leg at @entity53 in controversial circumstances by taking the ball off captain @entity296 to score a penalty , @entity52 was soon at it again on thursday night			1
the striker had already had a ticking - off from referee @entity132 before he became the first name in the @entity133 official ’s book for ploughing into @entity87			0
@entity118 shoots for @entity7 during the @entity15 tie in the first half in @entity38 on thursday evening @entity121 forces a save out of @entity17 goalkeeper @entity92 as @entity7 look to take the lead during the last 32 tie @entity52 was substituted for @entity123 after 82 minutes and the striker gives manager @entity43 a glance as he leaves the pitch @entity17 supporters pictured during the @entity15 tie as one sign in @entity38 reads : ' welcome to @entity316 ' @entity17 fans cheer on their team during the @entity15 round of 32 match on thursday night in @entity38 @entity321 watches his penalty saved by @entity7 goalkeeper @entity252 in the @entity19 final in @entity38 in 2005 @entity7 celebrate winning the @entity19 on penalties on may 25 , 2005 , in @entity38 as they beat @entity26 @entity325 , absent on thursday night , holds the @entity19 trophy up in 2005 after winning on penalties in @entity38			1

@entity52 and @entity121 were paired up front while @entity119 also started
@entity17 substitute @entity29 scored after 72 minutes via a @entity101 assist
@entity101 could have scored the winner in the 92nd minute when he hit the *crossbar* from six yards out
@entity121 *limped* off after 106 minutes as he was replaced by striker @entity122
the game went to extra time but neither side could score and it went to penalties
@entity7 beat @entity26 3 - 2 on penalties in the @entity346 final in @entity38
