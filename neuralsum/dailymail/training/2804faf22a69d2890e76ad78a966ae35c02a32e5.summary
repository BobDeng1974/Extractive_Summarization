despite a lack of consistency and cutting edge , @entity0 still believes his 10th - placed @entity5 team can challenge for a top - four finish in the @entity7 this season			1
unfortunately for @entity0 , the history books firmly suggest otherwise with no team since the @entity7 's inception finishing higher than sixth after being 10th at @entity12			1
a third decent performance in a week saw @entity14 salvage a point with a header in the seventh minute of added time as they drew 2 - 2 with @entity19 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity0 believes @entity5 can finish in the top four despite being 10th at @entity12 @entity14 celebrates after scoring a dramatic equaliser against @entity19 in injury time at @entity22 on sunday in 1993 , @entity23 led his @entity5 to sixth place after spending @entity12 in 10th @entity25 , pictured playing against @entity26 , scored 14 domestic goals as @entity5 finished in sixth in 1993 speaking after the game , @entity0 declared : ' can we now challenge for the top four ? yes			1
the most important thing is that we are moving in the right direction again			0
' while @entity5 have at times impressed with the pace , pressing and passing which was associated with their run to second place last season , they have collected just 22 points from their 17 games which finds them languishing in mid-table			2
the last club to finish as high as sixth after a spending the festive period in 10th was , in fact , @entity5 in 1993			1
during that season , with club legend @entity23 at the helm , @entity5 were had earned 28 points from their opening 20 games , winning eight compared to @entity5 's six victories since the start of the current campaign			0
@entity0 may be backing his side to make history , but with @entity5 's frontline of @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 scoring just two @entity7 goals between them so far , @entity58 fans will be calling out for a star striker such as @entity25 , who bagged 14 league goals for the club during the 1992 - 93 campaign			2
there 's little doubt that @entity5 will be in far better shape after the return of injured frontman @entity62			0
in his absence others have had to weigh in with goals but they have n't done nearly enough as @entity14 's late effort against @entity19 took the club 's tally to just 21 in 17 matches			0
since 1992 , @entity80 trio @entity78 , @entity81 and @entity82 have all spent time in 10th position at @entity12 with mediocre second halves of the season to follow			0
in the 22 season , only eight teams have managed to finish in a higher position than their festive spot with @entity91 and @entity92 managing to finish in seventh during their respective seasons in 2005 - 06 and 2007 - 08			2
only one team has ended up being relegated from the top flight after being mid-table ahead of the new year , with @entity98 ending their 2010 - 11 @entity7 season in 19th position after a disastrous second half of the season			0
@entity5 will not fare that badly , but fourth seems a long way away			0
@entity5 's summer signing @entity60 is yet to score for @entity5 in the @entity7 @entity62 has been out injured since the end of august and will spend @entity12 in @entity107 @entity0 talks to @entity5 captain @entity108 during the @entity7 clash at @entity22 on sunday @entity110 buoyant despite mistakes @entity98 were relegated in 2011 after spending the festive period in mid-table			1

@entity5 will spend @entity12 in 10th place after 2 - 2 draw against @entity19
no team in 10th during the festive period has finished higher than sixth
@entity0 believes his side can still earn @entity123 spot
@entity5 finished sixth in 1993 after being in mid-table at @entity12
