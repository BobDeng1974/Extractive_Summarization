by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 10:57 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:10 est , 19 december 2013 @entity5 risks ‘ importing a wave of crime ’ from @entity8 and @entity9 when work immigration curbs are lifted on january 1 , the government was warned today			1
@entity12 mps said crime rates linked to eastern @entity14 were ‘ really quite startling ’ and will only get worse in the @entity15			1
ministers also came under pressure for failing to draw up any estimates on how many more people might move to the @entity5 to help schools , hospitals and the police to plan ahead			0
from january 1 restrictions on @entity9 and @entity8 working in the @entity5 will be lifted @entity5 is required to lift temporary restrictions on the free movement of people from @entity9 and @entity8 at the start of 2014			0
the government is rushing through new laws to stop migrants claiming benefits in the @entity5 for the first three months			0
but in a debate in @entity34 today , @entity12 and @entity32 lined up to criticise the government ’s approach and for not knowing what the impact will be when the borders are opened			1
conservative mp @entity40 : ‘ we are importing a wave of crime from @entity9 and @entity8			1
’ he warned that crime among @entity9 in @entity45 was ‘ really quite startling ’ , adding : ‘ @entity9 are seven times more likely to be arrested in @entity47 than a @entity5 national			2
‘ @entity9 account for more than 11 per cent of all foreign offenders , despite making up , at the moment , just a tiny proportion of residents			0
@entity54 mp @entity53 criticised the government for failing to produce an estimate of how many more people would move to @entity5 ‘ last year , @entity9 accounted for almost half of all arrests for begging , and one third of all arrests for pickpocketing in the capital			1
’ mr @entity40 said that as a special constable with the @entity64 on the @entity65 he has first - hand experience of the problem of @entity9 criminals ‘ and i must tell you , that eight out of 10 pickpockets are from @entity9			2
‘ so the whole thing is completely out of control and the @entity9 authorities need to provide the @entity5 police with information about the criminals which they know are in this country , far more quickly than they are currently providing			0
’ he added that voters would find it ‘ disgusting ’ the @entity81 had failed to fulfil its ‘ basic duty ’ to find out how many @entity8 and @entity9 planned to come to the @entity5 on january 1			0
@entity54 mp @entity53 - the @entity54 chairman of the @entity84 - said ministers did not know the number because they never asked their experts and advisers to find out			1
mr @entity53 added : ‘ i think that is a big mistake because now we have estimates that vary from 10,000 from the @entity8 ambassador , to 20,000 from the @entity9 ambassador , to 50,000 from @entity95			2
’ it comes after sir @entity97 , chairman of the @entity98 , told @entity32 last week that he had never been asked by ministers to estimate the number of @entity8 and @entity9 expected to come to the @entity5 when labour market restrictions are lifted			1
many @entity12 mps are worried that lifting @entity104 restrictions will see tens of thousands of workers from both countries coming to work in the @entity5			0
they have repeatedly demanded the government put an estimate on the number after the lifting of restrictions in 2005 led to many more @entity113 migrants arriving at @entity5 ports than initial estimates by civil servants .			0
