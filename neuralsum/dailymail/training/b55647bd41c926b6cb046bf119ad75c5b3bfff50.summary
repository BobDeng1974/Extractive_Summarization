by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 10:48 est , 19 march 2013 they may have never spoken out publicly about their romance , but @entity3 and @entity4 are magical together , according to their unwitting matchmaker and best - selling writer @entity7			1
the young @entity9 stars met last year on the set of the @entity11 : @entity12 , the upcoming big screen adaptation of @entity7 ’s book and have been inseparable ever since			1
and the novelist – whose new book @entity16 , the highly anticipated end to her @entity19 trilogy is out today - tells @entity20 they are ' clearly in love '			1
happy couple : @entity4 and @entity3 beam as they attend the @entity24 in @entity25 in november			1
clearly in love : @entity3 and @entity4 as @entity27 and @entity28 in the big screen adaption of @entity12			1
going into battle : @entity3 and @entity31 in the @entity11 : @entity12			1
the couple play @entity27 and @entity28 , both ‘ @entity35 ’ , a breed of demon hunters , in the film that comes out this summer			1
@entity4 was previously engaged to his @entity38 co-star @entity37 after meeting on the set of the @entity40 hit , but the couple split last summer after two years together , while @entity3 dated twilight hunk @entity41			2
@entity7 , 39 , admitted : ‘ i remember coming to the set and one of the people who worked on the crew mentioned it			2
‘ then i saw them together and they ’re so clearly in love and it ’s very sweet			2
i wish them all the happiness			2
‘ they ’re very close and i begin to see them now in my head when i ’m writing			2
i wrote @entity27 as very petite and delicate with freckles , because it ’s a lot of fun to do a reversal because she turns out to be strong , which is very like @entity3			2
there ’s a sense of sweetness about her , but she can also transform into being really tough and strong and an ass - kicker , which is a lot of fun too			1
fantastic : best - selling fantasy author @entity7 ‘ and @entity71 – he ’s exactly the same ! very sarcastic and funny and very beautiful			1
’ as their romance bloomed on the set of her film , @entity7 adds : ‘ i still find it amazing that they first time they met was in their audition for @entity27 and @entity71 ! ‘ the first time i really got to talk to them was at dinner , and we were talking about the chemistry test @entity4 did with @entity3			2
@entity3 was our @entity27 and we were looking for @entity71 and i said ‘ you guys were amazing , anybody could see that @entity4 just seemed to be @entity71 ’			2
‘ and they said ‘ we were just watching our audition together the other day ’ , which i thought was very sweet			2
@entity3 is stunning in person - her mum @entity98 is very pretty , she came on set while we were filming and you can see she has good genetic material			1
’ indeed , speaking about @entity4 , 24 , earlier this month , @entity3 , 24 - the daughter of singer @entity100 - said : ‘ he had this perfect mixture of being this witty , kind of jokey , cocky in the best sense of the word , but also extremely vulnerable , emotional and this great mixture of emotions			1
and that ’s what @entity71 is			2
he has to walk in a room and make people turn their heads and that ’s what @entity4 does			2
the petite brunette added : ‘ he just brought everything to the room that day			2
and he left and i just turned to everyone and was like , ‘ i really do n’t know what else you could be looking for			2
’ @entity7 ’s success has ensured that she is now one of an elite group of women fantasy writers who have spawned chart - topping series			1
she joins @entity38 star @entity127 , @entity129 writer @entity128 and @entity131 scribe @entity130 in creating strong female characters for young girls to aspire to			1
she 's magical : @entity3 in the @entity11 : @entity12			1
@entity71 and the gang : @entity4 and his band of @entity35			0
her new book , @entity16 , is the end of the series which takes place in @entity141 and centres around a teenage girl called @entity144 who finds herself swept into the @entity35 world			1
and @entity7 says : ‘ for me , the triad of @entity38 , the @entity131 and twilight feature strong women and as a declared feminist , it ’s a wonderful thing			0
these women have really opened up this particular world of storytelling , which i ’m very grateful for			0
‘ i think as women we ’ve always been very used to growing up reading and identifying with male protagonists , especially in fantasy			1
there ’s a saying in publishing that girls will read about boys , but boys will only read about boys and it ’s important to give women strong heroines			0
‘ and as women we ’ve come to recognise the necessity of writing these characters and making them accessible to everybody			0
highly anticipated : clockwork princess , the third and last installment in @entity19 series , is out today			1
‘ there ’s an aspect to readying this age group , with the trials the characters are facing : how do i become a person ? how do i become a good women ? and these books directly address that			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity38 came out and said these books are about kids , but not necessarily for children			0
and that made it okay , for people of all ages , from all walks of life , to read fantasy			1
i feel these books really opened up the gates for people like me			0
’ @entity7 revealed that she had also been helped by her best - selling peers , although she has never met @entity127 , joking : ‘ i believe she lives in a castle in @entity199 now ! ’ however , she does keep in touch with @entity128 and @entity130 , saying : ‘ @entity128 has been lovely , super-promotive and she ’s recommended my books to a lot of people			1
‘ she ready the manuscripts of two of my books early on and was also one of the first big promoters of the @entity131 , she talked about it everywhere			0
‘ and @entity130 worked as a screenwriter for a long time and she gives great advice			0
’ when it comes to bidding farewell to her characters , @entity7 admits : ‘ it is really difficult to say goodbye to the characters and know i ’m not going to write about them after five years of working and doing research and traveling to @entity221 every year			0
‘ i ’ve had a lot of feedback from fans , they email constantly			0
i ’m going to miss @entity144 a lot , she has some grand adventures , she has to face off against great enemies , she has to do battle and defeat her enemy and find out who she really is			0
she knows she has a magical power , but she does n’t know why			0
‘ one of the reasons why i constructed a love triangle is that she ’s a girl who has these many , many choices about her life			0
co-stars : @entity3 fell for @entity4 after auditioning with him for the @entity11 : @entity12			1
@entity240 : the cast is made up from a number of @entity240 actors including @entity244 star @entity244 who plays @entity245 in the film			0
‘ i think the books do n’t necessarily follow the traditional love pattern , fans will find the ending bitter sweet , but it ’s a fitting conclusion			0
’ @entity7 , who lives with her husband , fellow writer @entity251 along with their three cats in @entity254 , is currently working on the sixth installment as she revealed the @entity11 series has its genesis in the 9/11 terror attacks			1
she said : ‘ i had just moved to @entity259 in september 2001 and immediately 9/11 happened and of course it completely changed the city and everybody who lived there			0
‘ i was in @entity266 , coming down the bridge as everyone was walking over , covered in plaster dust and blood , and the shopkeepers opened up along the street to give out free water and we were running over to hand it out			0
people were very kind and brave in a crisis			0
‘ it made me want to write a story set in @entity259 , a kind of fantasy and a love letter to the city and the people who live there			1
heartthrob : @entity4 has become a rising star			0
‘ there was this idea of monsters and demons and people were so afraid of the city being attacked			0
there were missing posters everywhere - it was a really a terrifying time to live in the city			1
i thought ‘ what if the city was really under attack by supernatural dark forces , who would protect it ? ’ she sold the film rights to her @entity11 series soon after publication and will be treated to the first glimpse at the first film at a private screening in @entity308 next month			1
she admits : ‘ i was very lucky and was brought into the audition process and i had all my friends trying to hack into my computer to watch all these famous actors auditioning			0
’ but the writer will have to wait to see how the film fares to see whether the next two books in the series , @entity317 , will be turned into movies			1
the next installment , @entity11 , is due next year			1
on top of that , she ’s written a project with her best friend @entity324 , about a young magician , called the magisterium			0
she ’s also teamed up with her husband to write the @entity328 , a guide to her world , which , as she says , makes for interesting dinner talk			0
all of which makes for a pretty fantastic life			0
