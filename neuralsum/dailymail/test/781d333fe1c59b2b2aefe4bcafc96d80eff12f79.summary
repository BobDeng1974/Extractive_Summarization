@entity0 first came to the attention of the wider world in a tv documentary charting @entity4 ’ early days in charge of @entity6 in the summer of 2012			1
in footage from a pre-season training session , the @entity6 manager is seen rebuking @entity0 — then a talented but largely untried teenager — for answering him back			1
a little more than two - and - a - half years on and much has changed			2
now @entity0 is a 20 - year - old @entity11 international and a cornerstone of @entity6 ’s first team			1
on wednesday he was back on tv again but this time he was attempting to call the shots			1
@entity0 has turned down a new deal with @entity6 and put off contract talks until the summer @entity0 has come a long way since being lectured by @entity4 during being @entity6 the winger was just 17 years old in 2012 when he was told off by @entity4 for answering him back at training @entity0 , pictured celebrating a goal for @entity11 , says he does not want to be seen as a money - grabber @entity0 has attracted interest from clubs including @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 @entity0 arrives for training at @entity6 's @entity31 training ground @entity0 arrives at training ahead of @entity6 's game with @entity28 @entity0 ’s message to @entity6 , and indeed @entity4 , would appear to be clear			1
he does not want to stay at @entity35 unless he can win trophies			0
he wants to play in his favourite midfield position			0
the interest from other clubs at home and abroad has made him feel good			0
as such , regardless of a £ 100,000 - a - week contract offer , he may choose to leave			1
as a piece of @entity45 , wednesday 's @entity43 interview was of questionable value			1
an apparent attempt to clarify his stance regarding an unsigned @entity6 contract has only served to muddle things			2
in trying to bring an end to media and terrace chatter about his future , it has only given it fresh legs			0
at one point during his chat , @entity0 admitted supposed interest from @entity28 is ‘ quite flattering ’			1
‘ my next game is against @entity28 , ’ he said , suggesting he can at least understand a fixture list , if not the delicacy of his situation or the impact of his words			2
‘ i want to do my best			0
i wo n’t be hiding			0
’ it ’s just as well because the chances are that he wo n’t be able to			0
@entity6 ’s fans , who value loyalty more than most , may have the young @entity73 in their sights now			0
‘ i do n’t want to be perceived as a money - grabbing 20 - year - old , ’ said @entity0 , but the denizens of the @entity76 may perceive precisely that			1
@entity0 's current £ 35,000 - a - week deal at @entity6 has two years to run at the end of this season @entity0 has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £ 100,000 - a - week to stay at @entity6 @entity0 says that he would have signed a less lucrative deal if he had been offered one at this stage last year @entity0 takes on @entity86 's @entity85 during @entity11 's @entity88 qualifier at @entity89 @entity90 broke the @entity0 contract story on monday - click here to read full article at @entity6 on wednesday the club ’s hierarchy were aghast			1
not only did they know nothing of @entity0 ’s chat with the @entity43 until other journalists rang to ask them about it , they are understandably suspicious about the timing and motives			1
@entity4 and his players are coming off a sobering home loss to @entity104 , in which @entity0 played poorly , and now face @entity28 in the @entity105 and @entity106 in the @entity107 — games that will go a long way to determining whether this current season is marked success or failure			1
now , rather than draw a line under talk about his contract , the subject of @entity0 and his future will dominate the next few days			1
@entity6 and @entity4 , who tends to be unemotional about these things , view this as unhelpful and unsettling			2
was this the whole point of the arrangement made by @entity0 ’s management with the @entity43 ? @entity6 are asking themselves this question , and , regardless of the answer , @entity0 ’s standing at the club has inevitably changed			1
at training at @entity31 on thursday , @entity0 will be treated no differently by @entity4 , just as @entity130 was dealt with evenly in the wake of interviews in the summer of 2013 in which he criticised his manager			1
there are other similarities with @entity130 , though , that are less palatable for the latest @entity6 player to wonder if he would be better off elsewhere			1
@entity130 said in summer 2013 that he wanted to leave @entity6 but was eventually convinced to stay @entity4 will deal with @entity0 in training at @entity31 on thursday in the same way he did with @entity130 there will be no shortage of suitors for @entity0 should he leave @entity6 - in the @entity105 and @entity144 @entity0 insists that he is focused on winning trophies and becoming the best player he can be @entity6 ’s owners will view this episode dimly			1
they would not sell @entity130 to @entity28 in 2013			0
selling good players to domestic rivals is not in @entity152 ’s playbook			0
equally , the @entity153 will not sell @entity0 this summer just because it would appear he may wish to leave			2
@entity130 had to wait a year and so may @entity0			2
he remains under contract for another two years , after all			0
and so a rather unpleasant game begins and it is tempting to wonder whether @entity0 will emerge from it as he would wish			0
@entity130 was a worldly-wise , well - travelled football gun for hire when he decided to take @entity6 on			2
he left home at 14			0
@entity0 , on the other hand , still looks like the boy on that video and in some ways he still is			0
he spoke on wednesday of his closeness to his mum and three - year old daughter			2
will they move to @entity170 with him ? @entity130 was a well - travelled football gun for hire when he took @entity6 on - but can @entity0 cope ? @entity6 boss @entity4 must convince @entity0 to sign a new deal and remain at @entity35 @entity0 should not be blamed for his ambition			1
equally , he should not be criticised for putting a number on his own value			0
he lives in an age when football salaries are soaring and in a couple of years the @entity105 will be £ 5billion richer			2
he has come a long way very quickly , however			0
since that rollicking on the green grass of @entity153 in 2012 , his trajectory has followed a steady upward course			0
this would be a bad time indeed to make his first really bad decision .			0
