but staff told her she simply had a urine infection and sent her home at 2pm that day			1
by 8pm it was clear ms @entity22 was indeed in labour , so her sister , @entity24 , drove her to hospital			1
however baby @entity2 was in such a rush to enter the world that she was forced to deliver him outside the entrance of @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			2
and moments after delivering the little boy , she realised he was n't breathing			2
quick - thinking ms @entity34 , a former childminder , wiped the mucus from her tiny nephew ’s mouth and gave him the kiss of life			1

i was a first - time mum , i did n’t know what was going on			0

' it was surreal , like it was happening to someone else			0
i just wanted to get to the hospital			0
' @entity5 was there or else @entity2 may not have been here today			1

' as we were approaching the hospital she said she wanted to push and when i saw the car park , i just did a handbrake turn across four spaces near the entrance , jumped out and @entity45 raced in to get the midwife			0
' @entity14 was in the back seats and i talked her through it			1
it all happened within minutes			0
' when the baby arrived he had mucus in his mouth so i wiped it out			2
he was n’t breathing so i gave him the kiss of life , then he started crying and i gave him to @entity14 to do skin - to - skin			1
