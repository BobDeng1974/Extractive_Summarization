by @entity0 a 200 - year - old , @entity2 - inspired mansion with eight bedrooms , six bathrooms and 10 car spaces in @entity8 's inner west is set to break suburban records if it sells for $ 9 million			1
but @entity12 property - which has a gate house imported from @entity14 in @entity15 - failed to meet the reserve price set by its owners of 24 years when the @entity19 estate went under the hammer on saturday afternoon			1
the most expensive property sold in the area was set in 2010 by a six - bedroom home in @entity24 , which sold for $ 4,105,000 , according to the @entity25			1
the mansion and its gate house , which is on the @entity28 , is located at 4 @entity29 in @entity19 - in @entity8 's inner west @entity12 ' @entity30 was built before 1854 in @entity14 and was then moved to @entity19 in two pieces by an @entity32 its current owners are @entity34 and @entity35 who run @entity37 joinery manufacturers @entity36			1
with the help of renowned heritage architect @entity39 , mr @entity35 transformed the two houses - with some parts dating back to 1813 - into the @entity43 - style vision seen today			2
the main house boasts an expansive kitchen decked out with granite benchtops , a commercial gas stove and finished off with @entity2 appliances			0
every room in the house has a touch of the past to channel the estate 's historic connections and has nine - feet high ceilings to add to its grandeur			0
the exterior matches the impressive interior , with extensive gardens sprawling across a 3,679 square - metre block of land			1
the property sits on a 3679 - square - metre estate ( left ) , and features eight bedrooms , six bathrooms ( right ) and has 10 car spaces the main house at @entity12 is designed in a @entity43 - style and is 200 years old			1
this is the first time it has been on the market for 24 years @entity12 ' owners reserve price was $ 9 million and was passed in by bidders on the saturday afternoon auction at @entity19 the property has been owned by @entity34 and @entity35 , of @entity37 joinery manufacturers @entity36 , for 24 years , was passed in the @entity76 - a smaller building on the property - was built before 1854 in @entity14 and is listed on the @entity78 's @entity28			1
it was selected by the then - @entity81 consul , @entity80 , at the 1854 @entity82 and was then imported with three or four other buildings to be set up at @entity84 - on @entity8 's @entity85			1
up until 1967 , it was the gate house of the @entity81 consul general 's residence , @entity89 , in @entity90			0
it was then bought by @entity92 ( @entity93 ) who was the wife of the former owner of @entity96 @entity95			0
the @entity76 was transported in two parts to @entity19 and re-built to be a main feature in the front of @entity12			2
the house was restored by architect @entity39 - who specialises in heritage buildings and its owner @entity102 to reflect its rich history other features in the house include a billiards room , music room , pool , spacious outdoor dining area and sweeping veranda to look over its extensive grounds the @entity76 was selected at the @entity82 in 1854 by @entity81 consul @entity80 and imported along with three or four other buildings for erection at @entity84 - on @entity8 's @entity85 much of its original structures are still intact as it stands on a large lawn , encompassed by a paved driveway			2
the building is made out of pitch pine , which comes from a resinous variety renowned for its ability to resilience to age and weathering			0
it still features a lot of its original joinery and hardware , including its clipped tin verandah valance and barge boards			0
but unfortunately none of these features attracted bids close enough to the $ 9 million reserve price set by the @entity138 for the 4 @entity29 property			2
it is surrounded by an encompassing driveway and has its own large lawn , making it almost a standalone house by itself the highest bid on the property on saturday was $ 6 million and its real estate agent said it was negotiating with a bidder to come to an agreement highlights of the house includes its expansive kitchen which fitted granite benchtops and a commercial gas stove , complete with @entity2 appliances according to the @entity25 , @entity12 is one of @entity19 's oldest , surviving estates and only attracted a $ 6 million bid at its auction			2
but @entity162 's @entity161 remains upbeat that she will be able to seal a deal soon			0
she said she in talks with the bidder who lives in the next suburb over in @entity168			0
' there is plenty of interest in the property , as you can see with 15 people registering to bid , ' she told @entity175			0
' it 's just that people decided to keep their hands in their pockets on the day			0
' @entity162 's suburb record for most expensive property sold is $ 4,105,000 - set in 2010 for a six - bedroom house in @entity24 its six bathrooms have kept with the gothic style of the house with wooden trimmings and vintage light fixtures large windows in the bedrooms give occupants the opportunity to experience the full impact of the property 's expansive greenery each of the rooms have high ceilings and are carpeted , with lofty dimensions and include ensuite bathrooms the property is is close to major shopping centres , elite schools , a variety of restaurants as well as train and bus stations all within walking distance			1

if the @entity12 estate sells for $ 9 million , the @entity19 property - in @entity8 's inner - west - would break a record
the suburb record was set by a $ *4.1* - million home in @entity24 that had six bedrooms and was sold in 2010
its two buildings sit on a 3,679 square - metre block of land that *overlooks* extensive , sprawling gardens
parts of the estate dates back to 1813 , and @entity30 was built in @entity14 , @entity15 before 1854
