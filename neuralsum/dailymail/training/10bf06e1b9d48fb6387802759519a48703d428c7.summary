by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 16:29 est , 14 october 2013 @entity1 was once a successful but stressed out family man in @entity3 but left it all behind twenty years ago to live underground in the @entity6 woods			1
he 's the @entity7 hole man who walked away from the 9 - to - 5 life , dug himself a house under a horse pasture and he has never looked back			1
‘ when you get rid of things and you ’re willing to have less , you ’re given a gift of more , ’ said @entity1 as he sat in his 8 - foot abode			2
‘ i told myself , “ buck up and pay the bills , ” ’ @entity1 recalled to @entity29			2
‘ this is just the way normal life is			0
’ then , at 33 , @entity1 read a 1974 book called @entity34 by @entity35 , which espouses a rejection of modernity in favor of a primitive lifestyle			2
@entity1 decided to model his own life after @entity35 ’s			0
while @entity35 found his peace on the shores of the @entity43 , @entity1 headed west to his home state of @entity6			1
on the cheap : @entity1 lives on $ 5000 per year and pays just $ 100 in rent every year for his two acres of land			1
he does off jobs and publishes a zine about the simple life to make money life guides : @entity1 first got the idea to leave his typical life behind when after reading @entity35 's @entity34 , right , about leading a primitive lifestyle			0
@entity1 himself has published under the pen name @entity58 , left he lived in a string of rustic dwellings — a cabin , an old flophouse , even a tepee — before building the tree - covered @entity7 hole out of mostly found materials in @entity22 , @entity6			1
now , twenty years after seeing the light in simple living , @entity1 is still in his 8 - foot dwelling in the ground			1
in the carpeted , wood - lined circular room , @entity1 has everything he needs			0
there appears to be electricity in his hobbit hole and a hot plate for cooking			0
though it barely seems to fit , a cushion rolls out for sleeping			0
while he prefers his surroundings relatively bare , @entity1 ’s life is n’t without its modern comforts : he has both an @entity83 and a @entity84			2
he also pays $ 53 per month for his cell phone			1
care free : 縄 don縯 believe in houses or mortgages , ' says @entity1			1
' who in their right mind would spend their lifetime paying for a building they never get to spend time in because they are always working ? ' ‘ i like being able to do what i want to do , ’ @entity1 told @entity29			0
untethered by the workaday lifestyle , @entity1 is free to do just that			0
every winter , when life on the horse pasture becomes too cold , @entity1 heads to @entity102 where he surfs each year from november to april			1
@entity1 supports himself with a zine about his simple lifestyle called @entity105 and by working odd jobs			0
he also penned a book called my @entity108 under name @entity58			0
one around $ 5000 a year , @entity1 is able to pay the $ 100 per year rent on his two acres of land , provide himself with necessities , and presumably the travel costs to @entity102			1
‘ i do n’t believe in houses or mortgages , ’ he told @entity29			2
‘ who in their right mind would spend their lifetime paying for a building they never get to spend time in because they are always working ? ’			0

@entity1 *parted* with his family and job in @entity3 to *eek* out a living in the @entity6 woods
' i do n’t believe in houses or mortgages ' : @entity1 now lives alone in a home buried *beneath* a horse pasture and pays $ 100 a year for the land
