by @entity0 the only thing worse than going back to school after a relaxing summer is watching a commercial about it deemed ' the worst commercial ever ' by internet viewers			1
or is it ? a 30 - second commercial for @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity9 was posted on @entity13 on saturday and so far has over one million views			1
though many @entity13 users think the commercial is ' terrible , ' it 's managed to go viral almost overnight , reports @entity18			1
it then shows several of the mall 's employees holding up various back to school items featured in the shopping center			2
' denim , ' says on employee as she holds up a pair of the season 's newest blue jeans			2
