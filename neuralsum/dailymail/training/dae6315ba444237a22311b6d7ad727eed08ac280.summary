by @entity1 reporter published : 13:46 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 17:04 est , 22 december 2012 agents from the @entity6 questioned the only known suspect in the sept. 11 , 2012 @entity9 consulate attack in @entity10 that killed four diplomats , the suspect 's @entity3 lawyer has told the @entity12			1
@entity13 , a @entity3 , was detained in @entity14 and extradited to @entity3 in october where authorities have said he is ' strongly suspected ' of being involved in the bloody commando - style attack on the @entity19 mission			1
additionally , his lawyer , @entity21 , added @entity6 agents also asked @entity13 about the @entity9 embassy attack in @entity3 a few days after the assault in @entity19 , suggesting @entity9 authorities are probing a connection between the two incidents			1
burning issue : ambassador @entity28 and three other @entity9 were killed in a six - hour , commando - style attack on the consulate in @entity10 the sept. 11 assault by armed men in the @entity19 city of @entity10 killed @entity9 ambassador @entity35 and three other @entity9 diplomats			1
members of an @entity39 militia , @entity38 , are suspected in the strike , but there has been little progress in the @entity19 - based investigation into the attack			2
a few days later , a mob attacked the @entity9 embassy in @entity47 , destroying property and an @entity9 school in the area , resulting in four deaths			1
the attack was believed to be instigated by a local group also called @entity38 , but it is unclear if it is connected to the @entity19 organization			2
killed : ambassador @entity28 ( left ) died of smoke inhalation , while agent @entity57 ( right ) died in a desperate battle with insurgents heroic : former @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack in early november , @entity65 senators @entity63 and @entity66 announced that @entity3 had agreed to allow the @entity6 to interview @entity13 , but it took another month and a half to organize the interview due to legal questions over any infringements on @entity3 sovereignty			1
in the end , three @entity6 investigators using a @entity75 translator posed questions to @entity13 for three hours through the @entity3 judge presiding over the case			1
@entity13 's defense team was not allowed to attend the questioning on the grounds that he was being interviewed as a " witness " rather than a defendant			2
@entity13 is being charged by the @entity3 for " membership in a terrorist organization			1
" @entity13 denies the charges			2
attack : a @entity9 ambassador and three other @entity9 were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours according to the timeline , around 9.40 p.m. @entity10 time on sept 11 , officials at the @entity105 's relatively fortified and well - defended base in @entity10 got a call from @entity109 officials at the @entity9 diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less - fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants			1
other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel			0
9.40pm - @entity105 officials in ' @entity121 ' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack			2
10.05pm - armed only with handguns , team of about six @entity105 security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound			2
10.30pm - with bullets whistling overhead , the @entity105 team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local @entity19 allies			0
11.10pm - a @entity136 drone , which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away , arrived in @entity10 to help officials on the ground gather information			0
11.30pm - @entity9 personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for , except for @entity28			1
11.40pm - driving back to the secure base , the evacuees come under further fire			0
12am - the installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket - propelled grenades			0
12am - a @entity105 security team based in @entity152 , which included two @entity9 military officers , lands at @entity10 airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador			1
1am - the patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting			0
4am - the reinforcements from @entity152 take a convoy of vehicles to the @entity105 base to prepare for evacuation			0
4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base , killing two @entity9 security officers			1
5.30 - a heavily armed @entity19 military unit arrive at the @entity105 base to help evacuate the compound of @entity9 personnel to the @entity10 airport			1
from 6am - roughly 30 @entity9 , as well as the bodies of @entity28 and the other three @entity9 killed during the attacks , were loaded on planes and flown out of the city , several @entity9 officials said			1
the dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organize a response to the attack			0
about 25 minutes after the initial report came into the @entity105 base , a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound			0
over the succeeding 25 minutes , the @entity105 team approached the compound , and tried , apparently unsuccessfully , to get local @entity19 allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons , and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound , the intelligence official said			0
at around 11.10pm , a @entity136 drone , which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away , arrived in @entity10 to help officials on the ground gather information			0
by 11.30 , @entity9 personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for @entity28 , who was missing , the intelligence official said			2
when they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the @entity105 base , however , the convoy carrying @entity9 evacuees came under fire			2
once they got back to the @entity105 base , that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket - propelled grenades			0
these patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes , the intelligence official said			0
around the same time , a @entity105 security team based in @entity152 , which included two @entity9 military officers , landed at @entity218			2
upon its arrival , however , the team spent some time trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing ambassador @entity28			0
after some time trying to solve these problems , the security team that had flown in from @entity152 eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra transportation , but decided not to go the hospital where they believed @entity28 had been taken			0
in part this was because they had reason to believe @entity28 was likely dead , and because security at the hospital was believed , at best , to be ' uncertain , ' the intelligence official said			0
not long before dawn , the reinforcements from @entity152 managed to take themselves and a convoy of vehicles to the @entity105 base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation			0
however , just after they arrived at the @entity105 base , the official said , a new round of attacks on that facility was launched , this time with mortars			0
although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes , two @entity9 security officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells , the intelligence official said			1
finally , a bit less than an hour later , a heavily armed @entity19 military unit arrived at the @entity105 base to help evacuate the compound of @entity9 personnel to the @entity10 airport , the official added			1
over the next few hours , roughly 30 @entity9 , as well as the bodies of @entity28 and the other three @entity9 killed during the attacks , were loaded on planes and flown out of the city , several @entity9 officials said .			1

@entity13 , a @entity3 , was detained in @entity14 and extradited to @entity3 in october
his lawyer said @entity13 was also questioned about the @entity9 embassy attack in @entity3
three - hour interview follows months of asking on part of @entity6
