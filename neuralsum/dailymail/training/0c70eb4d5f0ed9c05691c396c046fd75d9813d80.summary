parents should be careful what they tell their children because lying to them can directly influence how honest they are , according to a study			1
in fact , the more the children are lied to , the greater the chance of them also cheating and lying			1
the results of the study suggest children are more inclined to lie if they discover adults have not been telling the truth - but the researchers are n't entirely sure why this is			1
parents should n't lie to their children ( illustration shown ) as this will encourage them to , in turn , lie more themselves , according to researchers			1
the study was carried out by the @entity21 in @entity22 although an exact reason for the result is n't known the study at the @entity21 tested 186 children aged three to seven in a temptation - resistance game			1
many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier			0
but research has found children can spot this tactic , and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them			2
once spotted , a study from the @entity39 found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves			2
determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people , explained @entity50 , lead author of the paper which is published in the journal @entity53			0
‘ when someone provides us information , we not only learn about what is being taught , we also learn something about that person			0
if the information is accurate and complete , then you might also trust that person in the future , ’ she said			0
approximately half of the children were lied to by a researcher , who said there was a huge bowl of sweets in the next room , but quickly confessed this was just a ruse to get the child to come and play a game			1
the others were simply invited to play , with no mention of sweets			0
the game asked children to identify character toys they could n’t see , by their sounds			1
sounds and toys were relatively easy to pair , although one sound was deliberately tricky : @entity86 ’s @entity85			2
when the classical music was played , the researcher was called out of the room to supposedly take a phone call , leaving the children alone in the room for 90 seconds and tempting them to take a peek at the mysterious toy making that sound			2
the children were explicitly asked not to peek			0
on returning , the researcher also explicitly asked the children to tell the truth			0
the five - , six - and seven - year - olds who had been lied to were both more likely to cheat , and then more likely to lie about having done so			1
@entity101 , associate professor of psychology and human development in the @entity21 ’s @entity22 @entity104 said : ' as far as we know , this is the first experiment confirming what we might have suspected - lying by an adult affects a child ’s honesty			1
' about 60 per cent of the school - aged children who had not been lied to in the study peeked at the tricky temptation toy , and about 60 per cent of the peekers lied about it later			1
among those that had been lied to , those figures rose to nearly 80 per cent peeking and nearly 90 per cent of the peekers lying			2
in the study , children were asked to identify well - known character toys ( stock image pictured ) they could n't see , using their associated sounds			1
one of the toys was intentionally difficult to identify and the researchers found the children were more likely to cheat , and then say they had n't cheated , if they 'd been lied to earlier however the study , published in the journal @entity131 , does n’t know why			1
' it could be the five - to seven - year - old children were simply imitating the behaviour modeled by the adult , or it could be they were making judgments about the importance of honesty to this adult , ' said professor @entity101			2
' or , it could be more nuanced			0
perhaps the children did not feel the need to uphold their commitment to tell the truth to someone who they perceived as a liar			0
' but it did n’t seem to make any difference to the pre-schoolers - they peeked and lied at about the same rates			0
this may be because three - and four - year - olds do n’t have very sophisticated abilities yet , said the research team			0
professor @entity101 added : ' even if it ’s expedient for an adult to lie , to get cooperation through deception , for example , or to get children to control their emotions , it ’s probably a bad idea in the long run			1
' the actions of parents suggest that they do not believe that the lies they tell their children will impact the child ’s own honesty			0
' the current study casts doubt on that belief			0
even a little white lie might have consequences			0

children who are lied to are more likely to lie themselves , research claims
study was carried out at the @entity21 in @entity22
186 children aged from three to seven who identified toys from sounds
when an adult lied to them and then left the room , the children were more likely to cheat in the game and lie about it after
but the researchers are n't quite sure why lying breeds more lying
