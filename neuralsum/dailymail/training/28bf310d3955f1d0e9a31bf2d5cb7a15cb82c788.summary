by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 have been criticised for implying some cosmetics are still tested on animals			1
@entity5 , which represents medical scientists , claimed the high street shops still use ethical claims to market cosmetics – despite the fact all make - up sold in @entity12 is now cruelty - free			1
since last year , it has been illegal to sell make - up and toiletries in the @entity15 which have been tested on animals anywhere in the world			1
false marketing ploy : @entity1 and @entity2 both market their products as ' non animal tested ' , however this is no different to any other cosmetic brand in the @entity12 as animal testing is forbidden in the @entity15 @entity2 defended its ‘ ethical ’ language saying it upholds the highest standards , while @entity1 said it continues to push for a worldwide ban			1
@entity30 , chief executive of @entity5 , which represents more than 100 universities , drug companies and charities , said that the animal testing of beauty products has long been banned in @entity12			1
and since last year , it has been illegal to sell make - up and personal care products such as shampoo and shower gel tested on animals anywhere in the world			1
she said : ‘ i think the fact that there are still cosmetics being sold in this country under the cruelty - free banner is appalling because that allows people to think that there are other products out there that have been tested on animals			1
‘ you ca n’t go to any country in the @entity15 and buy a cosmetic product that has been tested on animals			1
you just ca n’t do it			0
so , it ’s really disingenuous of them to maintain this cruelty - free banner			0
’ cause : @entity2 hosted an ' animal testing reenactment ' in a @entity65 store in 2012 to spearhead a campaign to end cosmetic testing on animals @entity1 clearly labels many of its products with the words ‘ against animal testing ’ and its website highlights some of its ‘ iconic cruelty - free products ’			1
@entity2 proclaims it is ‘ fighting animal testing ’ , while products made by many smaller companies display a @entity79 logo awarded by @entity80			1
mrs @entity30 said that a recent poll for @entity5 found that just a third of people know about the cosmetics ban			0
she applauded the likes of @entity2 and the @entity1 for their part in driving through the sales ban – but asked why the slogans and emblems are still being used more than a year later			1
she questioned whether they fear sales will go down if they lose the selling point that made them stand out from other stores and said : ‘ we still see various logos about being against animal testing			2
no doubt it is true that they are against animal testing but so is everybody			0
‘ you ca n’t by law sell products tested on animals			2
‘ i take my hat off to @entity2 and the @entity1 for doing the work to get the ban in			2
i am in no way an apologist for cosmetic research but the time has come to be open with the public about the fact that cosmetic testing on animals does n’t happen anymore			0
’ banned : since 2013 , it has been illegal to sell make - up and toiletries in the @entity15 which have been tested on animals anywhere in the world mrs @entity30 made her remarks at the launch of an agreement pledging more openness in animal experiments for medical research – which is still allowed by law			1
more than 70 companies , research institutes and charities have signed a concordat that aims to remove the secrecy surrounding the topic could see medical research labs open their doors to the public			0
mrs @entity30 said that perpetuating the idea that cosmetics are being tested on animals could undermine the public ’s acceptance of medical research aimed at finding cures and treatments for disease			0
she said : ‘ i think it does muddy it because we know that people still think that when we talk about animal research , we are taking about rabbits ’ eyes and shampoo ’			0
@entity2 defended its use of cruelty - free language			2
it said it goes further than the law by not dealing with companies that test anything on animals anywhere in the world			0
this includes firms that test new foods or drugs on animals			0
@entity171 , @entity2 ’s ethics director , said : ‘ we try not to pass our money and our customers ’ money on to companies that do animal testing			2
’ @entity80 also said its criteria are more stringent than the @entity15 ’s			0
a spokesman for the @entity1 said : ‘ whilst the ban in @entity181 is a great milestone , animal testing on cosmetics products and ingredients continues to take place in other countries around the world			2
‘ as an international brand , we support our partner organisation @entity80 in calling for a complete international ban and continue to feature @entity191 on all our products as part of our long standing commitment to this issue			0
