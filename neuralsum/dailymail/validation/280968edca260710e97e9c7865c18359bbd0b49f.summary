an artist has created the world 's smallest sculpture only for it to be accidentally crushed by a finger while being photographed			1
@entity5 's creations are so tiny they can rest on a human hair and are the same size of an ant 's head			1
having spent months working on the pieces , the 45 - year - old from @entity11 , @entity12 , took them to a photographer to have them pictured under a microscope			2
but within minutes his work had been destroyed by the stroke of the lab technician 's finger			2
' the technician went to change the orientation and then for the next half an hour we were looking for the piece through the lens			0
' eventually i noticed there was a fingerprint exactly where the sculpture used to be and i was like " man you have just destroyed the smallest art pieces " ever made - i slightly freaked out			2
' the sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano - painting			1
they are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope			0
mr @entity5 uses a 3d printing technology to produce them			1
describing the process on his website , he said : ' the structure is created using a ground - breaking new 3d printing technology and a technique called @entity62			0
mr @entity5 has produced a number of nano sculptures using the same technology though the naked woman above is believed to have been the smallest the artist from @entity11 , @entity12 , described his work as a combination of ' art and @entity71 ' ' ultimately these works are created using the physical phenomenon of two photon absorption			1
art , literally created with @entity71			0
' this two photon absorption occurs only at the tiny focal point - basically a tiny @entity77 ( called a @entity78 )			0
' the sculpture is then moved along fractionally by a computer controlled process and the next pixel is created			0
slowly , over hours and hours the entire sculpture is assembled pixel by pixel and layer by layer			0
' the sculptures are believed to be the smallest representation of the human form ever created by man .			1

@entity5 produced the tiny sculpture which was less than 1mm tall
he *enlisted* the help of lab technicians to photograph it under microscope
one of the team accidentally crushed the artwork when photographing it
mr @entity5 's sculptures are believed to be the smallest in the world
