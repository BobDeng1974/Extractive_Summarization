@entity0 cut inside , not an awful lot was on , and let fly			1
we had crept into the 92nd minute at @entity3 and this frantic night looked destined to end all - square			1
call @entity5 ’s deflection into his own net unfortunate , but @entity7 will argue you make your own luck			1
facing their bitter rivals for the first time in the league since 1998 , this was more than just three points			1
if they were n’t already , @entity18 ’s side are firmly in the @entity20 mix. and they know it			2
a snapshot of the table flashed up just after the final whistle			1
‘ just look at that , ’ beamed one fan			2
the @entity28 find themselves fourth in a division which includes @entity30 , @entity31 and , of course , the @entity33			2
@entity34 of @entity7 scores to make it 1 - 1 in the final 10 minutes to electrify @entity3 a late deflected shot from substitute @entity38 saw the @entity28 collect three very deserved points over @entity41 @entity41 goalkeeper @entity42 looks gutted after they slipped to a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity3 @entity7 celebrate their winner against bitter rivals @entity41 on friday night after snatching three points @entity7 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity34 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity0 , 75 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 , 66 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 , 84 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 goals : @entity34 ( 81 ) , @entity0 ( 90 ) bookings : @entity34 , @entity56 @entity41 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity42 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity72 , 74 ) , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 subs ( not used ) : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 goals : @entity76 ( 57 ) bookings : burn , @entity67 referee : @entity89 ( @entity90 ) @entity34 ’s calamitous slip had looked to gift the visitors all three points , but they rallied brilliantly to turn this on its head			1
the villain @entity34 equalised - sufficiently redeeming himself - and then @entity0 sealed what is their biggest win of an encouraging season			1
‘ it ’s tremendous for all of us and so important for the supporters , ’ @entity18 said			2
‘ it was a packed house and a great place to be			2
‘ they deserve to be there			2
’ this was @entity7 ’s opportunity to show they mean business in @entity113 football ’s second tier and nobody came away disappointed on a night @entity41 were shaken			1
these have been long , tortuous years for the @entity28 and friday night under the lights felt very much like the outpouring of 16 seasons of frustration			2
simply put , @entity18 ’s side were superb			2
they buzzed , pressed and provided real moments of quality to suggest they are at home in the top six			0
‘ i ’m disappointed to say the least , ’ @entity41 boss kit @entity126 said			1
‘ we were poor first half but stayed in the game - weathered the storm			0
we got our noses in front and it ’s galling to come away with nothing			0
’ @entity7 are now making those who had previously sneered at them for being a gentle , harmless club sit up and take notice			1
whether they would have enjoyed the same impact under @entity139 is up for debate , but what these supporters know is that @entity18 has put them back on the map			0
@entity41 goalkeeper @entity42 pulls off a great save to deny @entity7 taking the lead on friday @entity42 kept @entity41 in the @entity20 match with a series of saves to deny @entity7 on friday the accusation levelled at @entity139 - here and during his ultimately doomed spell at @entity151 - is that he never took enough risks			1
the same ca n’t be said of his replacement			0
during a frantic start he had the foresight to switch wingers @entity55 and @entity54 , and that move almost paid off immediately			0
@entity58 was tenacious in unsettling the gangly @entity5 out wide , surging beyond the central defender before clipping a ball to @entity54			0
the away supporters behind that goal sensed the danger , wincing as the sea parted for the on - loan @entity165 man , and were indebted to the brilliance of right back @entity67 who courageously threw himself at the goalbound effort to deflect wide			0
if there were any suggestions @entity7 would find themselves overawed by the evening , that move dispelled them			1
it was they who enjoyed the majority of possession , pinging the ball about as if it was they who had mixed it in the top flight years previously			0
@entity50 watched his chance palmed over the bar by @entity42 while @entity184 ’s diving header was tipped wide and @entity52 fluffed his lines six yards out			0
make no mistake , @entity126 ’ men were flustered			0
but for a blocked @entity77 shot , they had barely ventured into the home third			0
@entity76 rises to meet the ball and head it towards goal as @entity41 looked to take the lead in the match the best chances came for @entity7 despite the efforts of @entity76 ( left ) and @entity197 ( right ) the intense @entity18 has his players following			1
they press all over the pitch , but none more so than @entity58 , who skipped away from halfway after a @entity41 to dangerously cross again			1
this time the ball fell to holding midfielder @entity53 bounding from his holding station , whose side - footed strike was superbly beaten away by @entity42 before he saved superbly from a @entity55 free - kick			2
this might ’ve been over by the break if it was n’t for the goalkeeper			0
and then a reminder of @entity41 ’s undoubted menace			1
@entity77 scampered down the left and found @entity76 free eight yards out , but @entity48 admirably pushed clear his header			1
the @entity214 might ’ve done better			0
@entity77 ’s rasping drive was well saved as the visitors showed flickers			2
but the best chances came at the other end			0
@entity58 was thwarted by @entity42 , having a night to remember before what seemed a sucker punch			0
the unchallenged @entity34 looked to play a ball up to halfway but slipped on impact , gifting possession to @entity75			1
now the hosts were stretched			0
@entity34 ’s parter @entity50 was left exposed , @entity77 finding the unmarked @entity76 and this time he made no mistake			1
we encourage the players to be brave , ’ @entity18 reasoned			0
‘ i do n’t mind a mistake			0
’ perhaps the single line tells you all you need to know about his team			0
@entity18 must have been annoyed had they not found the net beforehand given their dominance			0
@entity7 had wasted their earlier chances before @entity34 ’s vicious strike slammed its way past @entity42			1
substitute @entity0 cut in from the right and saw his rather weak effort deflect beyond @entity42 to send this pocket of the city absolutely potty			1
‘ they deserved the points , ’ @entity77 said			2
never a truer word spoken			0
@entity76 scores @entity41 's first and only goal against @entity7 , who went on to turn it all around @entity76 gave @entity41 the lead in the second half against @entity7 in the @entity20 match @entity76 celebrates scoring the opener for @entity41 against @entity7 away from @entity254 on friday			1

@entity76 gave @entity41 the lead in the 57th minute
@entity7 equalised in the 81st minute through @entity34 , *atoning* for a *costly* error that allowed @entity76 to open the scoring for the visitors
substitute @entity0 stole all three points with a deflected strike in final minutes
