@entity1 , 17 , struggles to walk without crutches after an ice skating accident left her with a crippling hip condition three years ago			1
but the student , who has to take more than 30 doses of pain relief a day , is planning to strut her stuff down the catwalk - even though doing so could dislocate her hips			1
she has made the finals of the @entity19 @entity18 on november 15 , which she is hoping to take part in without her crutches			1
@entity1 was devastated after a cartilage tear she sustained in 2009 put an end to her promising career as a figure skater - and left her unable to walk unaided after she developed complex regional pain syndrome ( @entity27 )			1
but determined not to be downhearted for long , she threw herself into her schoolwork - and entered the modelling contest from her hospital bed			2
the teenager , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' it 's a bit unusual for someone with my condition to be thinking about strutting down a catwalk - my hips might dislocate when i 'm halfway down			1
' but i 'm really determined not to let my condition hold me back - and i want to be a role model for other people suffering too			2
' i was gutted when i was first diagnosed - not only would i never skate again , but i knew i 'd probably never walk without crutches either			2
' i knew i could n't live my life being miserable though - and some of my friends persuaded me to enter the modelling competition			1
' i thought it looked like something to throw myself into and i gave it a go - but i never expected i 'd get very far			0
' i 'm thrilled to have made the finals - i 'm delighted that other young girls might look at me and see that whatever life throws at you , you should keep your head up and put your mind to what you want to do			0
' @entity1 suffered a fall while figure skating training in 2009 - but at the time , she thought it would leave her with no more than a nasty bruise			1
she now takes 30 doses of pain relief a day but as weeks of gradual pain turned into months of agony , doctors revealed she was suffering from @entity27 - which got so bad she was bed ridden in hospital for two months			1
she now has to take a cocktail of drugs to manage the pain - which also causes her hips to dislocate as she moves around			1
it is thought she will have the condition for life			0
@entity1 said : ' i used to train for my figure skating a few times a week - and one day i had a bit of a fall on the ice			1
' i did n't think anything of it , but the pain kept getting worse and worse			0
left : the student was a keen gymnast and figure skater before her accident which put her in hospital ( right ) ' doctors knew i 'd injured my hip , but they could n't tell to what extent			1
the pain carried on getting worse for months , until the day i picked up my gcse results			0
' i went out for tea to celebrate , but my leg completely gave in - i could n't move , and my mum had to call an ambulance to @entity100			0
' i was in hospital for two months then , which was when i was officially diagnosed			0
" i have a lot of physio and a lot of painkillers - but i 'm used to the pain now			0
' my hip will dislocate four or five times a day - it just clicks out and it 's more of an annoyance now that anything			2
' i just have to rotate it and it will go back in , but it is a pain			0
determined not to be downhearted for long , @entity1 threw herself into her schoolwork - and entered the modelling contest from her hospital bed			2
right : danielle with her mother @entity116 ' i have enjoyed doing a few modelling shoots , and if i get further in the competition , it 's definitely something i 'd like to do as a sideline in the future			0
' however , i 'm studying for my a levels at the moment because i want to work as a nurse , with people with long - term health problems			0
' her mother @entity116 , 51 , said : ' we 're so proud of how @entity1 has coped with her condition			2
she is a great role model for young girls , and this is a huge confidence boost for her			0
