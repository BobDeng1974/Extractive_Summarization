by @entity0 published : 13:17 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 30 october 2013 two @entity2 helicopters came within 50ft of colliding on a night exercise because the pilots could nâ€™t see properly through their night vision goggles			2
a report which revealed the near - miss described it as ' a very serious incident that could potentially have ended with fatalities			1
' the near - tragedy happened three miles north of @entity12 , @entity13 , at 11.10pm on june 4 this year			1
the two @entity15 8 helicopters were returning to a nearby base , @entity17 , at 80 knots ( 92mph ) just 200ft above the ground as part of a night flying exercise			2
a @entity15 8 helicopter similar to the two which came 50ft from crashing near @entity17 , @entity13			1
almost the entire fleet of @entity15 helicopters at @entity17 was grounded in 2000 after a safety scare ( file photo ) a diagram of the near - miss , which happened on a night exercise above @entity12 , @entity13 , on june 4 both crews were concentrating on climbing above power pylons which lay ahead of them in the darkness			1
but they were wearing @entity36 visors , which restricted their field of view more than other , more modern equipment			1
that prevented the four crew members from seeing flashing safety beacons which were fitted to each of the grey camouflaged aircraft			1
the two crews only spotted each other with seconds to spare , when one crew member grabbed the controls and took violent evasive action , according to the near - miss report by the @entity53 ( @entity53 )			1
the helicopters were separated by just 20ft vertically and 50ft horizontally			0
' collision was avoided by a very late sighting by one of the aircrew and his quick reactions to take control , ' said the report			1
' there were no barriers left after this			0
@entity17 , @entity13 , where the two @entity15 8 helicopters were based ' the overriding contributory factor was deemed to be the complexity of low - level night vision goggle operations and the associated restricted field of view			1
' ' wider field of view night vision goggles would naturally contribute to improved aircrew peripheral vision			0
' whilst this requires an equipment upgrade such systems are available today and arguably would have enabled the crews , in this case , to have seen each other at a much earlier stage			2
' their ageing aircraft , from a family which has been in use for almost 40 years , were also not fitted with widely - used collision warning systems which would have sounded an alarm			2
the report added the incident would probably never have happened it the helicopters had traffic warning systems			1
the @entity15 is part of the @entity91 which served in the @entity92 , both @entity94 wars and is currently the scourge of drugs traffickers and pirates			0
it is due to be phased out and replaced with new wildcats within a few years			0
the @entity53 said that the safety margins were so far below normal it ' only just stopped short of actual collision ' , and designated it a category a incident - the highest risk short of an actual crash			1
the incident came amid an apparent spate of helicopter crashes this year			2
in august four oil workers were killed after the @entity112 helicopter carrying them to a rig near @entity114 ditched into the @entity115			0
workers were scared to take the daily round trip after the accident and the @entity112 fleet was grounded			0
a @entity121 report later ruled a technical fault was not to blame			2
workhorse : @entity15 helicopters have been deployed in the @entity92 and both @entity94 wars , but are due to be replaced			0
the near - miss between two @entity127 8 helicopters similar to these in june was named a ' @entity129 ' , the worst possible without a crash happening ( file photo ) last month , an @entity132 helicopter used by the @entity133 crashed into the @entity134 , sparking a frantic search for two missing crew members			1
and in january , experienced air ambulance and film stunt pilot @entity138 , 50 , was killed when the helicopter he was flying crashed into a crane on the @entity141 , which was still under construction in central @entity143			0
the burning wreckage also killed pedestrian @entity145 , 39 , from @entity146 , @entity147 , as he walked on the busy street below			0
the @entity15 fleet itself was almost completely grounded in 2000 after a @entity15 used by the @entity150 crashed			0
it took two years to get the fleet flying again after 44 of the helicopters had to have new titanium rotor heads installed .			0

near - miss over @entity12 , @entity13 , was caused by old equipment
crash averted by seconds when crew member took violent evasive action
report : ' serious incident that could potentially have ended with fatalities '
