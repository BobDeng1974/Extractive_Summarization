as the part - time players of managerless @entity4 punched the air in celebration of their latest point against @entity9 , the scale of the job facing @entity2 veered into sharp focus			1
frankly , the new @entity12 boss faces the biggest uphill task since sir @entity14 conquered @entity15 if he is to succeed in getting this bunch of players back to the summit league of @entity20 football			1
on a night when @entity21 left their shock new signing — ex-sunderland and @entity27 striker @entity25 — on the bench until the dying embers of the match , a glancing header by former @entity33 kid @entity32 opened the scoring and had @entity9 on the back foot			1
@entity9 ' @entity36 and @entity21 's @entity38 tussle for the ball during the match at @entity12 @entity9 forward @entity41 challenges @entity21 's @entity42 during the @entity44 game @entity21 's new signing , former @entity47 and @entity27 striker @entity25 , made his debut at @entity49 two goals from @entity51 in five minutes looked like somehow securing a rare victory for a stodgy and lethargic @entity9 but @entity54 ’s late leveller ensured deserved parity for the team from the @entity57			1
it was merely the latest sting from the @entity59 , who have now drawn twice at @entity12 in the league this season , as well as holding @entity9 at home in the @entity44 and knocking them out of the @entity64 in @entity65			1
for @entity12 fans , the elation of @entity68 ’s boardroom coup has very much been replaced by the utter deflation that comes as standard when watching this side			2
indeed , when @entity2 ’s team travels to @entity76 on sunday hoping to keep their play - off hopes alive , the second-most expensively assembled squad in the country can be said to pitch up in @entity78 in the grip of relegation-esque form			0
over the course of the last nine games — a quarter of a league season — third - placed @entity9 have dropped 19 points from an available 27			2
in context , they have picked up eight points , while second - bottom @entity21 and rock - bottom @entity88 — who drew at @entity12 on saturday — both have amassed six over the same time period			1
@entity9 ' @entity91 gives chase to @entity21 's @entity93 during the @entity44 match at @entity12 and , worryingly for @entity2 , not even five changes to his starting line - up could inject any badly - needed urgency into proceedings			1
there was a first - team recall for goalkeeper @entity101 , who was pulling on a @entity9 jersey for the first time in seven months after recovering from a shoulder injury			1
that meant @entity106 was on the bench , with veteran keeper @entity108 dropping out of the squad altogether			0
injuries meant @entity9 were without defender @entity111 and attacking midfielder @entity112 , who has been one of the @entity12 club ’s best players since arriving on loan from @entity27			1
striker @entity116 dropped to the bench , while @entity118 found himself left out of the squad completely			0
but the team news that stood out was @entity25 , who took his place on the bench and would remain there for most of the evening			2
@entity9 ' @entity123 and @entity21 's @entity42 both raise their feet for the ball during the 2 - 2 draw in front of a crowd of 28,902 , the first chance fell to @entity9			1
@entity36 raced down the left and his cross found its way to @entity51 , who turned and shot over the bar			2
then captain @entity135 seized on a corner and , when his first effort was blocked , his subsequent shot went out for a throw - in			0
the grumbles from the @entity12 stands began on 12 minutes			0
with each passing minute they grew louder			0
but young @entity142 gave them something to get excited about when he picked up a pass from @entity41 and sent a 20 - yarder narrowly over the top of @entity148 ’s crossbar			0
@entity149 then had a chance after good work down the left from @entity41			0
but his turn and shot ended with the ball being fired straight down @entity148 ’s throat			0
@entity157 then had a firm shot saved easily by @entity148			0
in the best move of the match , @entity159 powered down the right and slipped a clever ball into the overlapping @entity36 , but the full - back ’s ball across goal was turned over his own bar by @entity169			0
on a rare foray up the park , @entity170 sent a weak right - foot shot from distance scampering wide of @entity101 ’s goal			0
it had been a listless first half and the jeers at half - time were from fans who sounded wearily accustomed to this type of fare			1
@entity21 defender @entity32 opens the scoring at @entity12 with a header past goalkeeper @entity101 @entity32 is congratulated by his team - mates after his goal gives the part - timers a shock lead at @entity12 @entity9 striker @entity51 equalised for the home side with a header of his own on 72 minutes he then added a second five minutes later to give @entity9 the lead against @entity21 on tuesday night @entity51 celebrates his second goal @entity21 player look frustrated with themselves for conceding despite @entity51 's brace , @entity9 go on to draw 2 - 2 and interim boss @entity2 knows the scale of his job there were more jeers at the start of the second half when the @entity12 support were beseeching their side to show some attacking urgency , only for @entity204 to take the safe option of a back - pass from the halfway line to keeper @entity101			1
worse was to follow when @entity21 scored with their first meaningful effort on goal			2
@entity211 ’s free - kick was glanced home by @entity32 as @entity12 was left stunned , but not surprised			1
‘ cancel their day off this week anaw @entity2 , ’ shouted a furious lone voice at the back of the @entity215			0
@entity9 nearly levelled with a header from @entity218 but @entity148 was equal to it as he pulled off a diving save			0
@entity2 ’s side got back into it , however , when @entity135 ’s deflected shot hit the bar and @entity51 cleverly diverted the ball with his head into the bottom corner past the stranded @entity148			0
@entity51 then thought he had won the match when he headed in a fine cross from the left by substitute @entity230			0
@entity54 ’s intervention in the 82nd minute , when he superbly chipped the ball over @entity101 and into the net , put paid to that idea			2
@entity54 was replaced by @entity25 in the 95th minute but there was no time for the journeyman , who has cost £ 9.5million in transfer fees over the course of his troubled career , to become a hero			1
but , as the @entity21 players milked their standing ovation from their hardy bunch of fans , the jeers and shouts of ‘ disgrace ’ that greeted the @entity9 players at the final whistle left everyone in no doubt who , once again , were the villains of the piece			1
@entity9 players look dejected after the final whistle as their hopes of promotion continue to fade away			2

*rangers* were held to a draw by part - time players of @entity4 at @entity12
@entity32 gave @entity21 the lead before @entity51 equalised
@entity51 then grabbed a second goal to put @entity9 in front
however , @entity54 managed to pull the *visitors* level late on
new @entity21 signing @entity25 was only afforded a cameo appearance
