the world 's last surviving male northern white rhino - stripped of his horn for his own safety - is now under 24 - hour armed guard in a desperate final bid to save the species			1
@entity8 is guarded day and night by a group of rangers who risk their lives on a daily basis as they try to keep the rhino from poachers lured by the rising price of ivory			1
but even without his horn , keepers in the @entity20 reserve of @entity21 in fear for his safety			1
@entity8 was moved , along with two female rhinos , from a zoo in the @entity42 in december 2009			2
the reserve , which specialises in the conservation of rhinos , was chosen because of its successful breeding programme with black rhinos			0
it had been hoped the move would encourage them to breed , but all attempts have been unsuccessful			0
the project was dealt a further blow when @entity64 - the world 's only other male , who also lived at @entity21 - died last october			2
it left just five northern white rhinos in the world - and the three in @entity20 are in particular danger			1
hunted : rhinos like @entity8 have no predators in the wild because of their size - apart from humans new home : it had been hoped moving @entity8 to @entity20 with two females would encourage them to breed @entity80 , one of the rangers who guards @entity8 , says the team regularly risk their lives to keep him safe			1
' with the rising demand for rhino horn and ivory , we face many poaching attempts and while we manage to counter a large number of these , we often risk our lives in the line of duty			1
' it is a sad end for a species which used to roam across the heart of @entity96 - from southern chad , across the @entity98 and up into @entity8			1
just over half a century ago , there were 2,000 northern white rhinos ; but 1984 there were only 15 , all in the @entity98 , according to the @entity102			0
but then conservationist managed to bring them back from the brink , and bought the population up to at least 30 animals less than a decade later			0
failure : but attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and @entity8 is now getting old high value : the price of ivory is now said to be between £ 40,000 and £ 47,000 a kilo but then poaching took its toll , and the entire park was emptied			1
the last northern white rhinos were spotted in 2006			0
their extinction has been fueled by the growing demand for ivory , which comes in large part from the @entity123 , where it is believed to be a cure for several ailments			2
the price for ivory has risen from between £ 170 to £ 541 per kilo in the 1990s , to today 's prices of £ 40,000 to £ 47,355 per kilo , according to a report by the @entity131			1
the rangers have taken steps to deter the poachers , but they still fear it may not be enough			2
@entity136 explained : ' the only reason his horn has been cut off is to deter poachers			0
' if the rhino has no horn , he is of no interest to them			0
' this is purely to keep him safe			0
' sad end : @entity8 is one of five northern white rhinos left , and a number of them are his descedents however , keeping them safe is a costly business : the team of 40 cost £ 75,000 for six months			1
it is usually paid for with money made from tourism , but recent instability in @entity20 , and fear of @entity163 - which is actually thousands of miles away - have kept people away			1
so the team at @entity166 is hoping to raise the money through crowd funding			1
' keeping the ranger team safe is expensive , ' the appeal reads			0
' they are given world - class training , and are kitted out with the latest in equipment and support , from night vision goggles to gps tracking , to a team of tracking and support dogs ...			0
' keeping the team funded and equipped is an ongoing challenge			0
' we are aiming to raise enough to safeguard the wages for the forty strong team for the next six months			0
' this is £ 75,000			0
any which way , every single pound contributed will help secure the rangers , that secure the rhino , for us and for future generations			2

@entity8 is the last hope for a species on the verge of being wiped out
