@entity2 has made a habit of announcing new handsets and then releasing a @entity4 version a couple of months later - as seen with the @entity177 and @entity178 and the @entity159 and @entity179			1

the @entity4 will be available in two colours - @entity184 and @entity161			2
there will be a @entity61 , 3g and @entity100 version but information about which ones will be available in the @entity189 , how much they will cost and when they will be released is n't due to be announced until the @entity191 for @entity5 and @entity192 in @entity17 on 20 june			2

the @entity4 , which costs around Â £ 550 @entity206 - free , is advertised as having @entity207 of internal storage , yet because or these preinstalled apps , operating system files and network features , this is almost halved to @entity212 .			2
