by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:03 est , 15 february 2014 @entity0 has launched a programme to help connect online mentors with women in developing countries trying to set up a businesses pope @entity8 was right			1
he recently said that the internet is a gift from @entity11 – and i could n’t agree more			1
it is hard to imagine life without it			2
available nearly 24 - 7 on our phones , in our homes , in public libraries , it has become a central part of everyday activities for most here in the @entity23 – a modern necessity			1
when my barristers ’ chambers first started using computers , i volunteered to teach myself to use the first word processor while i was on maternity leave			2
two years later , i was the chair of the @entity31 ’s information technology committee , trying to convince my colleagues that access to a computer helped flexible working			0
i could do my legal work , not just in my chambers in @entity39 , but also when accompanying @entity40 to his constituency in @entity42			0
@entity40 struggled initially , sticking to pen and paper while at @entity45			0
i was jealous because he had a state - of - the - art computer on his desk which he never turned on			1
he did not even use a mobile phone when he had the wonderful @entity45 switchboard to make his calls for him , which meant that when he stood down as prime minister , he was barely able to use his mobile			0
sadly , he has now become a @entity54 addict , which just goes to show that he still is n’t very up to date with the latest technology			0
today , thanks to the internet , i can work anywhere in the world at times to suit my family demands			1
i can send emails at midnight , catch up with the day ’s news , buy food or books or manage bank accounts – all online			0
but to many women in developing countries , the internet is much more than a convenience			1
it is a crucial lifeline which can mean the difference between success and failure			0
this is what @entity8 was referring to – the ability to use the internet gives access to a whole new world of information and connections that can transform a person ’s life			1
when i left @entity87 , i thought there must be a way to use the internet to connect women in a meaningful way			1
with the help of @entity95 , my foundation developed a programme to connect online mentors with women who are trying to set up businesses in developing countries against the odds			1
men do n’t take them seriously			0
they have a hard time getting loans			0
sometimes they lack the proper business training to succeed			1
meanwhile , they are expected to carry out their household duties and look after the children			0
it can be a very lonely experience , so connecting to someone and being able to talk about these challenges can be a complete game - changer			1
take @entity117 , a business owner in @entity118			1
she had an arranged marriage at a young age and a family who were opposed to her attending university			0
she persisted and eventually completed a phd programme in psychology			2
she set up a personality assessment system for businesses but was derided by male colleagues and taken advantage of by suppliers			0
early adopter : former prime minister @entity130 sends @entity0 a bunch of flowers using the internet in 1999 @entity117 had good business sense and the right education but it was a very difficult environment to work in and she felt isolated and defeated			1
then we connected her to two mentors – @entity138 , an engineer and it consultant with @entity141 , one of our first corporate partners providing more than 40 mentors , and @entity145 , a treasury sales executive with @entity147 , where we have more than 100 employees involved in our mentoring programme			2
they met for only about two hours a month but those two hours changed @entity117 ’s life			0
with @entity138 and @entity145 ’s guidance , she was able to improve her website and develop a strategy to obtain clients			0
perhaps most importantly , she gained a newfound self - confidence			2
the hostility and barriers she faces as a woman doing business in @entity118 remain but she now has a support system as she works to overcome them			2
' @entity40 has now become a @entity54 addict , which just goes to show that he still is n't very up to date with the latest technology ' and it ’s not just @entity117 who is benefiting			0
her son will grow up to see a woman who is successful in business and who has become a role model for other women			1
@entity117 is fortunate to have internet access			2
for others , the infrastructure is n’t always there			0
access can be prohibitively expensive – far more than our monthly contracts in the @entity23			0
for developed countries , internet access is about one to two per cent of monthly household income , but to access the internet in less developed countries , it costs closer to 30 per cent of the average monthly household income			1
it is no surprise then that less than a third of the population in developing countries are connected to the internet			1
there are organisations addressing these issues , such as the @entity199 , a coalition of more than 50 organisations from the public , private and civil society sectors			2
@entity117 is one of nearly 1,000 women in more than 50 countries we have mentored online			1
the impact is far reaching – research shows that women tend to reinvest their profits back into their families and communities so the more we connect women worldwide , the better the world will be			1
as pope @entity8 said : ‘ it is not enough to be a passerby on the digital highways			0
’ technology gives us the ability to give life - changing support with just a few hours of our time			2
i admit i have become a bit of a techie ; always wanting the latest technology and lucky enough to be able to get it			0
but the internet is more than just gadgets			2
we can use it to stretch out a hand across the virtual world to help some really great women improve their lives and the lives of those around them			1
