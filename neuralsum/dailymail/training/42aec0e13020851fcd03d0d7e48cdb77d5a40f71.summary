by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 14:39 est , 7 august 2013 shocking new images today laid bare the scale of the devastation in @entity4 wrought by months of civil war , with neighbourhoods flattened by multiple bombing raids			2
the satellite photographs collected by @entity9 reveal how parts of @entity11 , the country 's largest city , were almost wiped out by missile strikes from government forces			1
the two - year civil war has seen the destruction of many of @entity11 's historic monuments , as well as six million @entity4 being forced to flee their homes after being caught in the crossfire between the regime and rebel fighters			1
while both sides have been accused of atrocities , the evidence in @entity11 suggests that rebel - held areas in the north and east of the city have received the brunt of the damage as the regime bombards those neighbourhoods with little concern for civilian casualties			1
an analysis by the @entity53 in co-operation with @entity9 concluded that the scale of the destruction was ' severely lopsided ' , with opposition areas significantly worse affected than loyalist ones			2
much of the regime 's firepower has been focussed on @entity11 because it is the rebels ' main stronghold and could severely weaken the opposition movement if the government wrests control			2
war : @entity66 was also hit by bombing on february 22 , leading to vast swathes of the neighbourhood being totally laid waste irreplaceable : this image shows a satellite view of @entity11 's @entity73 before and after its minaret was blown up during fighting in april in total , half of the city 's population has been displaced as a result of the fighting			1
@entity9 pointed to three areas in particular which were almost totally destroyed by government air strikes in mid-february			0
satellite photographs of @entity84 , @entity29 and @entity66 show that whole blocks of houses have been wiped off the map			0
160 residents of the area were killed in the raids , and hundreds more made homeless			0
in addition , historic monuments such as the minaret of the city 's @entity73 have been demolished , despite the international laws on protecting culturally significant sites			2
start of conflict : during september last year , serious physical destruction - marked on this image with red dots - was confined to just a few areas development : fighting in @entity11 raged fiercely , as this image from november indicates , with the regime desperate to evict rebels from their strongholds ' @entity11 has been utterly devastated , its people fleeing the conflagration in huge numbers , ' said @entity9 's @entity110 , who has visited @entity4 more than 10 times over the past 16 months			1
' the risk cited one year ago regarding the devastating consequences of turning what was @entity4 's most populous city into a battlefield has become reality			0
' @entity11 has been utterly devastated , many of its residents fleeing the bombardments in huge numbers and many others trapped in a city under fire and under siege in desperate humanitarian conditions			0
' despite repeated calls for both sides to respect internationally accepted rules of warfare , observers have noted serious war crimes on both sides , including the indiscriminate shelling of civilians and summary executions of prisoners of war			0
relentless : @entity11 in february this year , when much of the north and east of the city had been hit by bombing raids latest : by may , few parts of the city had escaped being severely damaged , with the devastation especially prevalent in areas held by the opposition @entity145 of @entity146 said : ' the grave violations of international law in @entity11 and elsewhere in @entity4 are a direct consequence of the international community 's paralysis and delay in effectively condemning these crimes , and referring the situation to the world 's criminal court of last resort			1
' the images are a snapshot of a population under brutal siege as @entity9 's researcher on the ground has revealed over time			1
' at least 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the civil war which originated in protests against the autocratic regime of president @entity167			0
in addition , millions of refugees have been forced into tent cities within @entity4 and abroad as they seek to flee the fighting .			0

images compiled by @entity9 show how @entity11 has gone from a *thriving* city to a wasteland
devastation has spread across the city over the past year , concentrated in areas held by the rebel opposition
cultural icons have been blown apart with half of the city 's population forced to flee the battle *zone*
