published : 05:35 est , 23 april 2014 updated : 05:46 est , 23 april 2014 she hobnobbed with royalty , befriended the men of the @entity3 and is responsible for some of the most iconic portraits of the @entity7 movement in existence			1
and yet , despite her many achievements , the incredible life and works of @entity14 , the @entity10 's first female press photographer remain relatively unknown			1
but all that could be about to change courtesy of the @entity17 , which recently acquired more than 2,500 @entity19 photographs and is to put a selection on display from next month			2
votes for women : suffragette @entity23 , the co-founder and leader of the @entity25 , photographed in @entity26 in 1909			0
protest : a suffragette demonstration in @entity28 on 13 june 1908			0
around 13,000 suffragists gathered on the embankment and marched to the @entity31 press campaign : female journalists taking part in a @entity23 demonstration carrying banners featuring a carrier pigeon with a quill pen to symbolise their profession the free exhibition , which concentrates on her images of the @entity43 , includes a rare shot of @entity46 's only son @entity45 who was killed at @entity47 aged 18 , as well as many others			1
so who was @entity14 ? born in 1862 in @entity28 's @entity51 , the future photographer lived a conventional life until a cricketing accident in 1903 left her husband @entity54 an invalid			1
forced to become the main breadwinner for her family , @entity14 borrowed a box camera and started photographing street scenes with plans to turn her work into postcards			1
' her story is largely untold , ' explains @entity63 , curator of photographs at the @entity17			0
' she became the breadwinner for her family after her husband was injured in a cricket accident and she had to earn a living for her daughter @entity69			0
' she started by taking photographs of street views with a view to selling them but actually , the majority of her work took her in a different direction			2
' leading lights : @entity77 , @entity23 , @entity78 and @entity80 march in @entity81 on 23rd july , 1910 activists : members of the @entity25 wearing the union 's green , white and violet , photographed in 1909 at the women 's exhibition packed : the main hall of @entity88 held in @entity26 , may 1909			1
on the walls can be seen a series of murals designed by @entity78			0
political : the @entity7 exhibition stand was one of more than 50 stalls set up at @entity88 held at @entity95 , @entity26 in may 1909 on their way : soldiers from the @entity98 leaving for the front bid farewell to their families on the platform at @entity102 in 1916 portrait of photographer : @entity14 became a photographer in 1903 at the age of 40 that direction proved to be an unusual one			1
living close to the @entity109 , @entity14 soon found her way inside and began taking photos - both formally and informally - of the soldiers of the @entity113 who were based there			1
just a year after beginning her career , @entity14 was appointed official photographer to the @entity3 - a step that would lead to some of the most important images ever taken			1
by 1914 , as war with @entity121 drew nearer , @entity14 had become firmly established , selling photographs to newspapers and magazines alike - many of which featured her soldier friends			1
' @entity14 's wartime photographs actually cover a huge range of subject matter so within the war period , you do see her focus changing , ' adds @entity63			1
' at the beginning , you get people mobilising and then the activities going on through to the injured soldiers returning			2
' she attends a tea party at @entity137 that the @entity138 hold for wounded soldiers in 1916 and you really do get the sense from many of her images that she 's an insider , she 's part of the war and that this is her contribution			2
' her meetings with @entity148 , both before , during and after the war , would prove a fateful one and the increasingly close relationship she enjoyed with the royal family led to some of her most impressive scoops			0
' because @entity14 is working within the barracks , she becomes well known to the @entity138 and this leads to a relationship where she 's allowed great privileges and access to major royal events and special occasions and also to the royal family quite directly , ' explains @entity63			1
' she 's given an exclusive commission with the @entity164 and produces a lovely portrait of a very young prince			2
' and she was the only person allowed in to see @entity167 when he died and was lying in state			0
she was allowed into @entity169 to photograph him at 4am in the morning			0
' but her work was n't all war and royalty			0
some of her most famous images feature the @entity7 movement , then at its height , as well as society events such as the @entity180 / @entity179 boat race			0
royal visit : the 3rd @entity182 get a visit from lieutenant hrh the @entity164 ( centre ) at their @entity187 training camp in 1914 party : a tea party for wounded soldiers from @entity10 and the colonies hosted by @entity148 and @entity192 at @entity137 wounded : patients from @entity194 visit the @entity195 in 1915			1

he is pictured with colleagues from the @entity202 ready for war : soldiers from the @entity206 and @entity207 guards stand in front of a hopeful message while a @entity210 ( right ) poses in 1914			0
he was reported missing a year later ' i think what 's so intriguing about @entity14 's work is her character and how that comes through in who and what she photographs , ' adds @entity63			1
' bearing in mind she 's this small - framed lady working in this quite often male - dominated environment , she has this ability to really pull people together to form lovely compositions			0
' she seizes their attention and you always get a sense of her relationship with her subjects , whether that 's the suffragettes or powerful soldiers going off to war			1
' @entity14 , adds @entity63 , would have needed to be quite the character herself , as well as determined , as she pursued a career that was a far cry from the trajectory expected of a woman at the beginning of the @entity238			2
' @entity14 would have had to have been quite a determined lady , ' says @entity63			2
' she 's described as quite formidable and i think to embrace the world of photography , which within her world was fairly unique , it would have been quite a brave thing to do			0
' @entity14 , a new free display at @entity17 exploring @entity247 € ™ s photographs of military life in @entity28 during the @entity43 , runs from the 4th april until the 28th september 2014			1
