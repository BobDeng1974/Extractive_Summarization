@entity4 , 23 , was looking to catch a big roach or perch fish when he cast his rod into a lake			1
as he relaxed on the bank his small float bobbed up and down on the surface of the water , prompting @entity4 to grab his rod in readiness			1
when he picked it up he could barely feel anything on his line but reeled it in and found a small spec on the end of his hook			2
on closer inspection he identified the catch as a three - spined stickleback , a common tiddler in @entity10 waters			2
after laughing to himself about the catch , @entity4 placed the 1.5 inch - long specimen on a set of kitchen scales and it weighed in at three drams , or 5.1 grams			1
although he missed out on a record for the biggest ever stickleback , which stands at four drams , @entity4 has caught one of the tiddliest of tiddlers ever in @entity10 angling			1
big catch : angler @entity4 with the stickleback which he hooked with bait @entity4 , a palletiser operator from @entity55 , @entity56 , has been jokingly mocked by friends and family for his not - so - big catch			1

' after a while my float stated dipping up and down and i thought it might be a small perch just messing about			0
' so i pulled it in , not really expecting to much on the end of the line , and saw this very small stickleback			2
' i weighed it using a set of kitchen scales , took a photo and it then went back into the water safe and well			0
