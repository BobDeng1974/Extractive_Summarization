' painful lessons ' : twenty - year - old @entity1 died after taking the former legal high @entity2 on a night out last year a coroner issued a stark warning today about the ' savage legacy ' of a former legal high known as @entity7 after a young woman died from taking the drug			1
@entity1 , 20 , snorted the class b drug after drinking vodka and @entity12 on a night out			1
the following day , she complained that her heart ' felt funny ' before collapsing and dying			1
two of her former friends were handed suspended prison sentences today after they admitted supplying her the drug , which is also called mephedrone			1
assistant deputy coroner @entity19 recorded a verdict of non-dependent abuse of drugs and warned : ' inquests can draw painful lessons from tragedy and i hope this tragic story does that			1
' i hope the lesson here is that these people seemed to have no appreciation that their actions were putting themselves at risk			1
' other people tempted to take @entity7 must realise that they might not be alive at the end of the day			1
' young people can be very cavalier about death , but their thoughts may change if they know the devastating effects @entity42 's death has left upon her family			1
' it is indeed a savage legacy			2
' an inquest in @entity47 , @entity48 , heard that the night before her death on april 4 last year , @entity42 had gone to a friend 's house , where the two had drunk vodka and red bull before going out to a club			1
at around 2am , @entity42 arrived at @entity57 's house where another friend , @entity58 , was already there			2
the four snorted @entity2 , which was initially distributed as a so - called legal high before it was banned in 2010 following calls from campaigners			1
@entity63 told the inquest yesterday : ' in the afternoon , she kept saying that her heart felt funny			2
she was catching her breath			2
' at around 5.30pm we were just sitting round watching tv when @entity42 just flopped down			2
at first , we thought she was joking , but then she started fitting			2
' i grabbed her and she just flopped			2
i think she was unconscious			0
' we all just freaked out			0
we laid her on the floor			0
@entity58 rang for an ambulance and they were telling her how to do cpr			0
she was pronounced dead at 8.40pm			0
a court heard today that after @entity42 's death , @entity63 began to clear the house of evidence , ringing the dealer to come and collect the rest of his supply , which he did			0
but her ' unsophisticated ' efforts did not stop police from finding the drugs bag and ' glossy catalogues ' which had been used to snort the drugs			0
@entity63 also sent a text to another friend who had been at the party , asking them to ' get @entity42 's phone ' , but the police had already arrived and seized the phone along with other evidence			0
the pair later gave statements to the police claiming the drugs had arrived with @entity42			0
warning : @entity42 complained that her ' heart felt funny ' the day after drinking vodka and snorting @entity7 @entity109 , prosecuting , said that after further investigations both defendants were arrested and made full admissions			1
@entity63 , 21 , pleaded guilty to supplying a class b drug and @entity58 , 22 , admitted to the concern and supply of a class b drug			1
both also admitted perverting the course of justice			0
they sobbed in the dock as they were handed prison sentences of ten and six months respectively , both suspended for 18 months , at @entity123			1
judge @entity124 told them : ' if ever a case demonstrated the dangerousness of even class b drugs this is it			0
' many people seem to think that drugs like this , of the m - cat genre , are harmless			1
and as this case demonstrates they can kill			0
' a statement released by @entity42 's parents @entity137 and @entity139 after the case said : ' we have recently had the first anniversary of our beautiful youngest daughter @entity42 and we are still in shock and disbelief that she is gone			0
' to say we are devastated is an understatement and the thought that we will never see her again has left us broken			0
' the loss of our bright , bubbly and loving girl has ripped our family apart and we , her sisters , and wider family , will never recover from it			0
' she is our first thought on waking and our last thought before sleep			0
she was a beautiful , fun - loving and caring girl who we miss very much			1
' we hope that @entity42 's death will serve as a warning against so - called party drugs as they can kill just as easily as drugs that are traditionally regarded as dangerous			2
