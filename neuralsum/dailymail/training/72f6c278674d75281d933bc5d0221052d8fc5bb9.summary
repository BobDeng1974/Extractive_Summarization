@entity0 has hit back at a @entity3 mp 's criticism of @entity4 by saying : ' we do n't make it for people who wear pink ties			1
' the @entity4 presenter launched the bizarre attack after @entity3 's transport chief @entity11 said the car fanatic was ' basically an idiot '			1
he also claimed @entity0 gives drivers a bad name , leading anyone with a car to be wrongly portrayed as a ' petrolhead ' , when in reality driving is the only way to get around outside @entity21			1
but what 's wrong with the occasional pink one ? ! ' mr @entity11 also insisted the @entity43 show was just ' old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets ' are ' not remotely representative ' of millions of people who drive			1
but @entity0 decided to hit back at the comments , telling his 4.4m @entity51 followers that he thought it was ' good ' mr @entity11 did not like the show			1
the controversial presenter added : ' @entity3 's transport spokesman say he does n't like @entity4			1
we do n't make it for people who wear pink ties			1
' mr @entity11 responded just minutes later , seemingly undeterred by the comment			1
he replied : ' obviously i wear red ties a lot			2
but what 's wrong with the occasional pink one ? ! what on earth might someone be implying ? ' @entity0 later tweeted , rather cryptically : ' i do n't like @entity68			1
it gives all the other planets a bad name			1
i mean i have n't been there but ... ' the online spat came after mr @entity11 took aim at @entity0 , a friend of @entity75 's and member of @entity78 set , in an interview with @entity81 magazine			1
he said : ' @entity0 – i have no time for him			1
it 's not just his politics			2
i mean the guy is basically an idiot			0
' and the idea that he is somehow the motorists ' representative ? no he 's not , he represents himself			1
he 's not remotely representative of motorists			1
' there 's a caricature of people like ' petrolheads '			1
they 're not ' motorists '			2
they 're people who have a car			2
that 's a lot of people – it 's how most of us move around most of the time			2
' we 've got to stop that caricaturing of a petrolhead , or a @entity0			2
@entity4 , a bunch of old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets ? they 're not remotely representative			0
' there are 30million drivers in the @entity111 , but mr @entity11 warned that they are unfairly targeted by politicians and officials working in @entity21 where public transport is more popular			1
the shadow transport secretary claimed politicians spend ' most of their time talking to the minority of people who do n't ' drive , because @entity120 is based in the capital			2
' the vast majority of people , their daily journey is by road			0
most people have a car , and use their car a lot			2
' he complained that the perception of drivers was skewed by the popularity of @entity4 , which @entity0 presents with @entity134 and @entity135			1
but @entity136 , @entity4 's executive producer , hit back			1
he said : ' he must be @entity137 if he knows what we do without watching the show			2
' if he bothered to watch it , he would know that we take as much pleasure out of celebrating a £ 1,500 estate car battling its way across @entity145 as we do from a @entity146 running at top speed			2
i 'll take his point on the jeans though			0
' mr @entity11 tore into the hit @entity43 show hosted by @entity135 , @entity152 and @entity134 , insisting ' old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets ' are ' not remotely representative ' of millions of people who drive top gear is one of the @entity43 's biggest global hits , attracting millions of viewers and generating millions of pounds with stunts and regular features like a star in a @entity165 , in which a celebrity drives around a race track against the clock			1
former @entity3 mp @entity169 once appeared on the show when a transport minister			0
but mr @entity11 rejected the idea he would join @entity0 , may and @entity135 : ' i do n't watch the programme , it 's not my kind of telly			1
' @entity136 , executive producer , @entity4 , said : ' he must be @entity137 if he knows what we do without watching the show			0
if he bothered to watch it , he would know that we take as much pleasure out of celebrating a £ 1500 estate car battling its way across @entity145 as we do from a @entity146 running at top speed			0
i 'll take his point on the jeans though ' mr @entity11 signalled that he wanted to end the idea that @entity3 wanted to wage war on the motorist			1

' i want to shift the tone of the national debate			0
the vast majority of people , their daily journey is by road			0
' given that most people spend most of their time travelling by road , i 've felt for a long , long time – and this is a criticism of all governments – that politicians spend most of their time talking to the minority of people who do n't			0
and that just seems a very odd approach			0
' we 're sat in the middle of @entity212			0
so many of the politicians and the journalists and the civil servants , we all work in central @entity21			0
' their personal experience of the transport network is not representative of the rest of the country			0
so it 's a collective failure			0
why would n't you talk to people about how they choose to travel most of the time ? ' he stressed that there is a ' whole bunch of reasons ' why people choose to drive , including the fact that in many areas bus and train services are expensive and unreliable			0
' i 'm not going to punish people in those circumstances , ' he said			0
the number of women stories has risen sharply in recent decades			0
figures in 2012 showed the number of new drivers is rising twice as quickly among women as it is among men			2
mr @entity11 said : ' there 's been huge growth in women drivers over recent decades			1
that 's been an empowering thing for women			0
' and a good thing			0
but why do women particularly choose to use cars ? perhaps because they 've got a greater burden of childcare responsibilities ; it 's ' mum 's taxi ' , a lot of it			0
it 's also about their access to employment			0
' and it 's also , in an evening in the winter , when it 's dark , it 's because they feel safer than on some aspects of public transport			0
i 'm not going to persecute people for making those kinds of absolutely legitimate choices			0

@entity11 *accused* the @entity43 show of *misrepresenting* drivers
claims host @entity0 ' represents himself ' and not motorists
says it is wrong that all car owners are wrongly portrayed as ' petrolheads '
@entity0 later hit back by saying ' good ' before criticising pink tie wearers
also tweeted : ' i do n't like @entity68 . it gives all the other planets a bad name '
mr @entity11 quickly replied : ' what 's wrong with the occasional pink tie ? ! '
