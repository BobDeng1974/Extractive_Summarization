by @entity1 reporter published : 01:55 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 : 01:55 est , 24 february 2014 in a lengthy profile of director of national intelligence @entity7 , the @entity5 spy chief said it would be impossible to prevent intelligence leaks like those perpetrated by former @entity14 contractor @entity12 and former army intelligence analyst @entity15 , who has changed his name to @entity17 now that he is imprisoned after being convicted of espionage			1
in the profile , @entity7 explains that the size of the intelligence community makes it virtually impossible to guarantee that leaks like those of @entity12 and @entity15 wo n't happen again			1
' in the end , ' @entity7 says , ' we will never ever be able to guarantee that there will not be an @entity12 or another @entity15 because this is a large enterprise composed of human beings with all their idiosyncrasies			2
' tough job : @entity7 says that despite the safeguards , there is no way to guarantee people wo n't leak classified information the profile was written by long - time national security journalist @entity37 and published on the @entity39 website			1
@entity37 describes @entity7 's job as ' the worst job in @entity42 ' due in part to the great responsibility that comes with being the person responsible for gathering the information that 's used to keep the country safe from enemies			2
gathering intelligence within the perimeters of the @entity51 can present challenges for those in charge of gathering it - and balancing the duty of keeping people safe with individual privacy continues to be a difficult task for the @entity5 intelligence community			0
adding to the difficulty for @entity7 is the fact that annual intelligence budgets are being cut for the first time since the job of @entity66 was created in 2005 in response to suggestions made in the @entity69 , which found that intelligence agencies like the @entity71 and @entity72 were n't communicating with each other , which led to major lapses in national security			1
@entity12 : @entity7 says he ca n't understand what motivates a fellow intelligence officer like @entity12 to leak damaging information according to @entity81 's profile , though , the biggest problem @entity7 has continues to be @entity12 , and the troves of information he turned over to journalists at the @entity85 , the @entity86 and other news outlets - as well as information that he has n't released , which could fall into the hands of the @entity90 or the @entity91			1
currently , @entity12 is in temporary asylum in @entity90			0
according to @entity37 , the @entity5 government still does n't know ' the full extent of what @entity12 revealed or whether more documents that have yet to be published in the press have made their way into the hands of @entity90 or @entity91 intelligence agencies			2
' what 's troubling for @entity7 is the fact that the information @entity12 leaked to the media came from a database designed to share intelligence amongst agencies within the government - which has been the primary mission of the @entity109 since it was created at the suggestion of the @entity69			1
@entity37 explains that the job of the @entity112 has been to ' transform the intelligence community ’s “ need to know ” culture to one of “ need to share			0
” ' ' traitor ' : @entity15 was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified information to @entity118 it was those changes , @entity37 says , that allowed @entity12 and @entity15 to exploit the new system to leak classified information			1
as for @entity12 , @entity7 has a hard time grasping why he - as a fellow intelligence officer charged with keeping @entity5 safe - would do what he did			2
' maybe if i had i ’d understand him better because i have trouble understanding what he did or what he ’d do , ' the director said			0
' from my standpoint , the damage he ’s done			0
i could almost accept it or understand it if this were simply about his concerns about so - called domestic surveillance programs			0
but what he did , what he took , what he has exposed , goes way , way , way beyond the so - called domestic surveillance programs			0
” as an intelligence profession , @entity7 says ' it ’s gut wrenching for me to see so much of this so casually exposed			0

@entity7 says the job of director of national intelligence is to force intelligence agencies to *cooperate* with each other
he says @entity12 exploited the mission of his job to leak classified information
@entity7 has put new safeguards in place to prevent leakers like @entity12 but says there 's no guarantee they will work
