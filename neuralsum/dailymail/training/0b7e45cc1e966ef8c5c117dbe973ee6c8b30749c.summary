@entity1 sen. @entity0 is making good on his promise to sue the @entity4 administration over what he calls ' precisely the kind of overreach we fought a revolution over			1
' his targets are the @entity11 , the @entity12 and other federal government offices that snoop on private communications at home and abroad			1
with former virginia attorney general @entity16 as his lead attorney , @entity0 filed suit wednesday morning in @entity20 federal court along with the conservative @entity22 organization			1
' there 's a huge and growing swell of protest in this country , ' @entity0 said during a wednesday morning press conference , ' of people who are outraged that their records would be taken without suspicion , without a judge 's warrant , and without individualization			1
' the legal action , officially titled ' @entity0 v. @entity4 , ' hit the court running with at least 350,000 plaintiffs , according to a source close to the process			1
@entity0 is aiming for 10 million , judging from a message on two websites run by his political staff			2
it ' could conceivably represent hundreds of millions of people who have phone lines in this country , ' he said big chill : president @entity4 stands accused of presiding over systematic abuses of the @entity50 's guarantees against ' unreasonable ' searches and seizures ' @entity68 rock star ' : @entity0 is solidifying his base through a class - action lawsuit aimed at cornering the political market on @entity68 objections to the @entity11			1
he said in a video message to supporters that his lawsuit would ferret out the broad ' general warrants ' over which the early @entity45 colonists fought the @entity79 crown former virginia attorney general @entity16 could n't capture the governor 's mansion in november , but he 's committed to the @entity85 lawsuit , sources close to the legal process say the lawsuit argues that the president ' has publicly refused to stop a clear and continuing violation of the @entity50 , ' @entity0 said in a statement from his political action committee			1
' i expect this case to go all the way to the @entity94 and i predict the @entity45 people will win			2
' wednesday morning he insisted that ' ultimately , the @entity94 will be [ the ] arbiter of what the @entity50 means			2
' and he predicted that his lawsuit ' could conceivably represent hundreds of millions of people who have phone lines in this country			0
' president @entity4 is named as a defendant , along with director of national intelligence @entity105 , director of the @entity11 gen. @entity108 , and fbi director @entity109			1
in a statement , the @entity110 defended the @entity11 's broad data collection , saying that ' we remain confident that the program is legal , as at least 15 judges have previously found			2
' @entity116 , the @entity117 national security council staff spokesperson , told @entity118 that ' we believe the program as it exists is lawful			2
' the @entity11 program , @entity116 said , ' receives oversight from all three branches of government , including the @entity123			2
more generally , the president believes that we should to take steps to give the @entity45 people more confidence that their privacy and civil liberties are being safeguarded			2
' sen. @entity0 , son of the former @entity132 congressman and frequent presidential candidate @entity133 , is attracting attention with an unusual blend of @entity68 policy that hat - tips social conservatism at every turn gen. @entity108 leads the @entity11 and routinely justifies his agency 's secritive work to members of @entity123 and federal judges in clandestine meetings outside of public view @entity4 said during a lengthy january 17 speech about @entity45 signals intelligence gathering – an oration that might be a preview of the government 's courtroom defense – that ' the men and women of the intelligence community , including the @entity11 , consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people			1
' ' they 're not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails , ' the president insisted			0
his press secretary , @entity165 , followed up ten days later with assurance during a daily briefing that ' to the extent that the @entity11 collects information , it is focused on valid foreign intelligence targets and not the information of ordinary @entity45			1
' ' look , ' he told reporters , ' i mean , terrorists , proliferators , other bad actors use the same communication tools that others use			0
' other democrats who are unsympathetic to @entity0 's position have been more crass about it			2
former @entity185 gov. @entity184 told the @entity186 on wednesday that the lawsuit just made him ' look like a petty politician			0
' ' obviously the strategy is to appeal to the base , ' @entity184 said			0
' @entity0 obviously thinks he has a leg up now with [ @entity193 ] gov. [ @entity192 ] @entity195 ’s problems			0
he wants to show the base he ’s a fighter , that ’s what suing the president is all about			0
' but as @entity0 swings hard at @entity4 , other potential 2016 @entity200 contenders are softening on the @entity11			1
@entity202 sen. @entity201 told the @entity203 on wednesday that , ' certainly we should need protect @entity45 ’s privacy expectations and privacy rights , but we also need an effective surveillance capability			1
' he worried aloud about ' five different organizations that brand themselves as @entity211 who every single day plot to attack our interests and our allies and even the homeland			0
we need to have surveillance capabilities to identify them			0
and we need to be careful about weakening those			0
' sen. @entity0 's objection focuses on the so - called bulk phone - record ' metadata ' that the @entity11 gathers routinely			1
the data includes phone numbers , dates , times , and the durations of calls			0
national security analysts say the massive tranches of data can be helpful when terrorism suspects are identified , because they allow investigators to establish who they have been talking to – and when			0
instigator : @entity235 , a former @entity11 contract employee , absconded with millions of records and leaked them to @entity239 newspaper , exposing secretive government snooping programs that sen. @entity0 is suing to eliminate @entity0 's legal advisers thought about filing suit in a @entity1 federal court , @entity118 's source said , but decided on @entity20 because its judges are accustomed to sifting through the thorny issues surrounding whether a class - action group deserves to be ' certified ' – if , that is , its members have standing to sue			1
he plans a press conference in front of the federal courthouse on wednesday morning to boast that he 's protecting the @entity45 @entity253 's @entity50 from the @entity117 's national security apparatus			1
' the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , ' that @entity50 reads in part			0
the senator first forecast his legal action in late december , and told the @entity266 that since the @entity4 administration ' has used the @entity269 to go after people ... we wonder if they would use the @entity11 that way			1
' ' everybody who has a cellphone would be eligible ' to become a plaintiff , he said			0
that interview came on the same day the @entity11 convinced a top - secret foreign intelligence surveillance act judge to green - light its metadata collection for a new 90 - day period			1
that program , the subject of worldwide leaks by former @entity11 contractor @entity235 , has won reauthorization at least 36 times during the past seven years			1
@entity0 's odd mix of libertarian crusade and conservative button - pushing is n't new , and it might become the norm on the right as more republicans try to find common ground between what amount to warring cousins			2
scene of the crimes ? this @entity11 eavesdropping facility in the @entity297 , code - named @entity298 , is reportedly used for domestic and international surveillance , including intercepting private phone calls			1
it 's inside the @entity301 , a 13,000 square mile area where wireless communications like radios , cell phones , and wi - fi are severely restricted ' @entity68 , or liberty , does n’t mean libertine , ' the @entity200 presidential hopeful told a red - meat right - wing crowd at a @entity20 gala last week			2
' to many of us , ' he said , playing deftly to a room full of social conservatives , ' @entity68 means freedom and liberty			0
but we also see freedom needs tradition			0
' @entity318 , who leads the influential right - wing @entity320 organization , is managing the list of plaintiffs for sen. @entity0			1
his group is also a co-plaintiff the speech came an hour after a lobbyist was heard introducing him to friends during a pre-dinner reception as a ' @entity68 rock star			0
' but @entity0 cautioned that ' i do n’t see libertarianism as , " you can do whatever you want "			0
' now the federal legislator is applying that message to the executive branch of government , and hoping the judicial branch will see things his way			0
but while his lawsuit percolates , @entity22 president @entity318 will manage the plaintiff - lists and turn them into a political mobilizing tool			2
' if you use a phone , you should care about this case , ' @entity318 said tuesday , adding that his group 's 6 million members stand behind the legal effort			0
names are initially collected on websites run by @entity353 , the @entity1 senator 's @entity354 , and by his political campaign – presumably one now engaged in planning for the 2016 presidential race			1
both websites ask web surfers to ' sign below and join my class - action lawsuit and help stop the government 's outrageous spying program on the @entity45 people			1
' they also ask for donations			0
' after you sign up , please make a generous donation to help rally up to ten million @entity45 to support my lawsuit to stop @entity372 , ' a message reads .			0
