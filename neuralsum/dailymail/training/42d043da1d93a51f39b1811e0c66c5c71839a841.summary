the capture of the most wanted sub-atomic particle in physics was today named as science journal 's @entity3			2
scientists had been chasing the @entity6 , nicknamed the ' @entity8 particle ' for more than four decades			1
in july the team from the @entity11 nuclear research facility at @entity12 in @entity13 announced the detection of a particle that fitted the description of the elusive @entity17			0
top breakthrough : a representation of traces of traces of a proton - proton collision measured in the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) experience in the search for the @entity6 the boson is believed to give matter mass via an associated ' @entity6 ' that permeates space			1
without the property of mass , the universe we live in could not exist			0
scientists used the world 's biggest atom smashing machine , the £ 2.6billion @entity37 on the @entity40 - @entity39 border , to track down the missing particle			1
finding the @entity17 topped the list of most important discoveries of 2012 released today by @entity44 , one of the world 's most prestigious scientific journals			1
the particle was first proposed by a @entity50 physicist professor @entity17 almost 50 years ago when he was a 34 - year - old scientist working at the @entity51			2
emotional moment : professor @entity17 appears to wipe away a tear after scientists at the @entity37 claim to have possibly discovered a particle believed to be the @entity6 but until this year , no - one had been able to prove that his theory was right			1
science news journalist @entity58 , who wrote about the discovery in the journal 's latest issue , said : ' @entity62 must somehow emerge from interactions of the otherwise mass-less particles themselves			0
that 's where the @entity17 comes in			0
' just as an electric field consists of particles called photons , the @entity17 field consists of @entity6 woven into the vacuum			0
physicists have now blasted them out of the vacuum and into brief existence			0
' @entity44 also lists nine other pioneering achievements from 2012			2
curiosity coming into land on @entity79 : the rover 's landing system was another scientific achievement hailed by the journal in its end - of - year round up brain - machine interface : @entity86 , a 52 year - old woman who was diagnosed with a degenerative brain disorder 13 years ago , using a mechanical arm controlled by her brain to feed herself			1

scientists had hunting for evidence of the @entity6 for over 40 years
physicists using found it using @entity12 's £ 2.6billion atom smasher
@entity44 also lists nine *runners* up
the @entity100 : scientists *sequenced* the @entity103 *blueprint* of the @entity104 , an extinct *species* of human that lived *alongside* @entity107 and the *ancestors* of people living today .
making eggs from stem cells : @entity114 researchers showed that *embryonic* stem cells from mice could be *coaxed* into becoming viable egg cells .
@entity120 's @entity119 : mission *engineers* at the @entity123 space agency @entity122 *safely* and precisely placed the @entity120 on the **surface** of @entity79 . they used a ' *sky* crane ' that dropped the *3.3* ton rover to the **surface** from a *hovering* *platform* on three *cables* .
****x-ray**** laser provides protein **structure** : researchers used an ****x-ray**** laser , which shines a billion times *brighter* than *traditional* *synchrotron* **sources** , to determine the **structure** of an *enzyme* required by the *parasite* that causes @entity140 *sleeping* *sickness* . the *advance* demonstrated the *potential* of ****x-ray**** lasers to decipher **proteins** that *conventional* ****x-ray**** **sources** can not .
*precision* *engineering* of *genomes* : the *revision* and *deletion* of *dna* in *higher* *organisms* has generally been hit - or - miss. in 2012 , a tool known as @entity149 , which stands for ' *transcription* activator - like *effector* nucleases , ' *allowed* scientists to alter or *inactivate* *specific* genes in *animals* such as *zebra* fish and toads , and cells from ***patients*** with *disease* .
@entity165 : the existence of @entity165 *fermions* , particles that act as their own **antimatter** and *annihilate* themselves , has been *debated* for more than seven decades . this year , a team of physicists and *chemists* in the @entity174 *provided* the first solid evidence that such *exotic* matter exists , in the form of *quasi-particles* . these are *groups* of interacting electrons that behave like single particles .
the @entity183 : a decade - long study reported this year in more than *30* *papers* revealed that the human genetic code is more functional than researchers had believed . although just 2 **%** of the genome codes for actual **proteins** , the @entity191 , or @entity183 , project indicated that about *80* **%** of it is active in ways such as helping to *switch* genes on or off .
brain - machine interfaces : scientists showed that **paralysed** human ***patients*** could move a mechanical arm with their minds and perform *complex* movements in three dimensions . the *technology* is still *experimental* , and *costly* , but the team is *hopeful* that one day it will help ***patients*** **paralysed** by *strokes* , *spinal* *injuries* and other *conditions* .
@entity210 : *hundreds* of researchers working on the @entity212 in @entity213 found the last part of the *jigsaw* describing how particles known as **neutrinos** morph from one *strain* or ' *flavour* ' to another as they travel at near - light speed . **neutrinos** may someday help researchers to *explain* why the universe contains so much matter and so little **antimatter** .
