@entity0 needs to have an outstanding @entity1 to be rated alongside @entity3 counterpart @entity2 as one of the planet 's best goalkeepers , according to @entity7			1
the former @entity8 keeper believes current @entity10 is yet to prove himself at the highest level , despite @entity12 and @entity14 's @entity13 claiming that the @entity16 man is the already the most talented stopper in world football			1
@entity7 concedes that the 27 - year - old is full of natural ability , but insists he must enjoy a strong tournament for @entity22 's side in @entity23 in order to move to the next level			1
if he has a tremendous tournament then he 'll be rated as one of the best in the world but he 's still got it all to do			2
' some players have described him as the best in the world but that 's premature			0
he proved he 's still got a lot to learn after his problems at @entity16 last season			2
' he 's got a lot of natural ability but there 's still plenty for him to work on and improve			0
' @entity0 came under criticism for his club performances during the opening months of last season and was subsequently dropped for seven consecutive @entity56 games by boss @entity57			2
he regained his place in the starting xi in december and played every remaining game as @entity16 overcame @entity61 and @entity62 to win their second league title in three years			2
despite @entity0 's upturn in form in the latter stages of last season , @entity8 's most capped player admits to being surprised by the number of high - profile mistakes made by the former @entity71 starlet			1
@entity7 said : ' it really surprised me when he lost his form earlier in the season			0
big mistake : this error by @entity0 allowed @entity77 to score a late winner for @entity62 against @entity16 last season experienced : @entity8 's record cap holder @entity7 was speaking at @entity82 's @entity81 masterclass ' that never happened to me			1
i did n't ever have a really bad spell			0
i had a game i wanted to forget on the odd occasion , but never more than that			0
' he 's a confident guy and that helps seep into the defence			0
but at the same time , he knows that one mistake could live with him for the rest of his life			0
we 've seen it before with @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
' @entity0 is still young and this is a big opportunity for him			0
his reputation will improve if he has a good tournament			0
' @entity0 will come up against @entity103 and @entity3 in the heat of @entity105 on saturday as @entity8 kick - off their group d campaign against the team who eliminated them from @entity109 on penalties			1
and while @entity0 will be focusing on the attacking talent at the disposal of @entity113 , @entity7 believes he should be aiming emulate the man in between the sticks at the opposite end			1
asked who the best goalkeeper on show will be at the @entity1 , the @entity118 and @entity119 keeper does n't hesitate			2
' @entity2 , ' he replies immediately			0
super stopper : @entity2 ( centre ) is the no 1 keeper in world football , according to @entity7 eye on the ball : @entity2 is set to line up opposite @entity0 in @entity105 on saturday night ' he has always been a very solid goalkeeper technically and he 's capable of making great saves			1
he 's obviously not getting any younger , but he 'll be very difficult to beat when @entity8 play @entity3			1
' @entity7 also rates @entity129 's @entity128 highly and picks out @entity131 's @entity130 as one to watch too			2
but neither are given the same praise as the @entity134 legend			0
if he finds his best form @entity23 , @entity0 might just have a chance of joining @entity2 in @entity7 's - and many other people 's - list of greats			1
bad day at the office : @entity7 rates @entity128 - but the @entity129 keeper was beaten five times by @entity143 @entity8 's most capped player @entity7 was speaking at @entity82 's @entity81 masterclass			1

@entity8 face @entity3 in their opening @entity1 game on saturday
@entity16 stopper @entity0 will go up against @entity134 ' @entity2
former @entity8 keeper @entity7 believes @entity0 will *deserve* to be called one of the best in the world if he enjoys a strong tournament in @entity23
@entity7 rates @entity3 's @entity2 as the world 's @entity157 goalkeeper
