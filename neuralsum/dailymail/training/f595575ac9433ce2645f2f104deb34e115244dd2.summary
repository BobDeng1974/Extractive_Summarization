these starkly beautiful images show a little known , but hugely important , landmark in @entity3 aviation history			0
masterpieces of engineering , these wind tunnels at the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) in the small town of @entity7 , @entity8 , were the testing grounds for @entity3 's earliest aircraft			2
the country 's best aeronautical engineers flocked to the @entity15 at the @entity5 to build and test generations of aircraft in the hangars that now lie silent and disused			1
@entity19 - inspiring : the wind tunnels at the @entity5 in @entity7 , @entity8 , were where prototypes for @entity3 's earliest aircraft were tested the age of the wind tunnels is only given away by the odd outdated touch : these wooden fan prop blades now lie still in a vast , 24ft wide fan history was made here : this shot looks like something out of a science fiction film , but is the @entity32 jet engine test area at the @entity5 in @entity7 the @entity34 wind tunnel control room at the @entity5 site was at the cutting edge in its day - now the control room looks more like a museum than the nerve centre it used to be testing ground : @entity3 's best aeronautical engineers built and tested generations of aircraft in the enormous hangars at @entity7 that now lie silent masterpiece of engineering : one can only imagine the noise , and the force of the wind produced when these 24ft fan blades were going at full blast tests for prototypes of early @entity55 biplanes , later aircraft including the @entity57 and @entity58 , were carried out in these tunnels , as well as trials for atomic bomb casings and even sir @entity63 ’s record breaking speedboat			1
the structures , one built in 1916 and the other in 1934 , stand as testament to the world leading engineering work carried out in the now disused buildings			0
photographer @entity70 captured a unique glimpse of the age - worn tunnels and surrounding buildings , which are currently closed to public view			2
@entity76 fan blades , vintage control rooms and concrete air tunnels may give an outdated feeling to the engineering , but it was once at very the cutting edge of aircraft development			1
the huge fans would drive airflow around a series of 90 degree turns within the tunnels			0
they used a series of bladed fins to guide the air efficiently back around the loop and finally through a narrow aperture - where it was accelerated into the testing area			2
the site still functions today as @entity96 , the headquarters for the @entity97 , and for defence use			0

glimpse into @entity3 's aeronautical history : this is a balance mechanism within the tunnel where items were tested for aerodynamic efficiency ; right : one of the fans looking more like something out of a @entity111 blockbuster , cell 3 at the @entity5 actually lies in the @entity8 countryside at the @entity113 the buildings at the @entity5 are home to complex machinery and powerful structures - on the right is the blast nozzle of a supersonic engine test cell this is the stunning and cavernous turbine hall , or air house , that powered the wind tunnels at the @entity5 in @entity7 vast machinery : cell 4 was built to fly @entity58 's @entity128 jet engine at mach 2 and a lowered air pressure to simulate the conditions flying at 57,000ft rarely seen : the beautiful photographs of the wind tunnels , which closed in the 1960s and are hidden from public view , were taken by @entity70 a prototype of the @entity57 fighter plane , pictured above , was developed and trialled at the @entity5 before it closed the supersonic @entity58 , pictured , was also developed and tested in the @entity7 wind tunnels under the guidance of the country 's top aeronautical engineers			1

wind tunnels at @entity5 in @entity7 , @entity8 , were testing grounds for prototype planes
country 's best aeronautical engineers worked to build and test generations of aircraft including early @entity55 biplanes
sir @entity154 's record - breaking speedboat , @entity155 , was tested there , as were @entity57 and @entity58
@entity76 fan blades , vintage control rooms and concrete air tunnels show the age of the once - cutting edge tunnels
photographer @entity70 was *allowed* access to the @entity5 site to photograph the now - disused wind tunnels
