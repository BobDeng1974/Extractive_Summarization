by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 22 april 2012 updated : 04:24 est , 23 april 2012 the @entity1 was plunged into a race row yesterday over the choice of the next archbishop of @entity5			1
a leading supporter of the @entity4 , dr @entity7 , who is one of the favourites for the job , said his name had been ‘ besmirched ’ by opponents who had resorted to ‘ naked racism ’			1
the allegation was levelled by the reverend @entity14 , a former member of dr @entity7 ’s staff , who is set to take up a prominent post in the @entity1 ’s national bureaucracy this summer			1
' naked racism ' : dr @entity7 ( left ) , who is one of the favourites to become the archbishop of @entity5 , said his name had been ' besmirched ' by opponents			1
lord @entity22 ( right ) today condemned any campaign against the archbishop of york vying for the top job @entity22 of @entity5 , the former archbishop of @entity5 , today hit out at the campaign against dr @entity7			1
he told the @entity28 : ' i am quite appalled			0
if there is a besmirching campaign then it is abhorrent and i , for one , will challenge this			0
' i think @entity7 would be a wonderful choice for @entity5			1
there are other people to consider , but he has a proven track record			0
' he said that while other candidates for @entity49 were being discussed in terms of their opinions and alliances , ‘ it is only when @entity7 is mentioned that such considerations give way to explicit criticism – some of it attributable , much of it anonymous whispering , but all of it in stark contrast to the way other bishops are being portrayed ’			2
mr @entity14 said some of the criticism has been ‘ disturbing ’ , citing the supposed description of 62 - year - old dr @entity7 by one @entity56 don as ‘ brutish ’			1
mr @entity14 said the use of the word was racist and added : ‘ at its best the besmirching of @entity7 has revealed that strand of snobbery which views outsiders as lacking class , diplomacy or civility – in other words not one of us			2
‘ at worst it has elicited the naked racism which still bubbles under the surface in our society , and which is exposed when a black man is in line to break the chains of history			0
’ candidate : dr @entity7 talks with the archbishop of @entity5 dr @entity80 , who is stepping down in the summer mr @entity14 , who is about to become the @entity1 ’s director of communications , ridiculed suggestions that dr @entity7 sometimes loses his temper			1
the row comes at a time when various lobbies inside the @entity1 are competing to get their own champion into @entity49			0
gay activists are hoping to find a figure potentially sympathetic to the cause of gay equality , while the liberal wing of the @entity1 is anxious to maintain its own dominance over major appointments			0
two of the last three archbishops of @entity5 have been prominent liberals , and one of the current favourites , the @entity97 , the right reverend @entity99 , was a member of the staff of one of them , the @entity101			2
dr @entity7 is not a favourite of @entity1 liberals , who do not like his firm line against gay marriage and his generally socially conservative stance			2
nor do they like his opposition to the left - wing doctrine of multiculturalism , his championing of the virtues of @entity114 , or his defence of the record of the @entity117			0
dr @entity80 , 61 , announced last month that he was standing down as archbishop of @entity5 , after ten years in the post			2
he is to take up the role of master of @entity123 at @entity124			0
his successor is expected to be named in late summer .			0
