by @entity0 with two double bedrooms , a large garden and planning permission for an extension , you might think £ 320,000 would be a bargain for a ' quaint ' @entity8 cottage			1
however , this house in @entity10 gives more the impression of long term project than family home , complete with rusty cars and a caravan hidden somewhere in its jungle of a back yard			2
despite this , in the increasingly competitive housing market , its enterprising owner was able to bump up the asking price from the original £ 299,950 and still attract an offer good enough for them to have stopped further viewings			1
the garden of the property has become completely overgrown and is strewn with abandoned vehicles an online advert for the property , which has drummed up an offer , despite its poorly maintained state in their online advert , property agents @entity34 say potential buyers have ' a rare and unique opportunity to purchase this quaint cottage set within the ever popular @entity41 development '			2
the estate agents , who have been listing the property since october 2013 , admit that it requires ' heavy refurbishment ' but insist it is a ' real blank canvas ' for people who want to put ' their own stamp on a property '			1
the home is also being advertised by agents @entity51 , who uploaded their advert on march 1			2
this advert mentions that the house has planning permission for an extension - however , it is not known whether this is in fact the case			0
the sole photo of the inside of the property can , at best , be described as austere , with bare white walls and floor boards covered with worn - looking rugs			0
however , it does offer a glimpse of what appears to be an original @entity71 fireplace			2
the property is described be estate agents as a ' blank canvas ' and an ' opportunity ' for potential buyers weeds have taken over the garden but the house is on a large plot that may have permission for an extension the internal photograph of the house paints an austere picture			1
agents accept it needs ' modernisation ' @entity86 , whose advert this internal photo is attached to , warn potential viewers that the property is in ' need of modernisation throughout '			0
the garden is the most striking part of this property			0
most prospective sellers spend thousands doing up their homes , hoping to claim the money back by being able to charge more for a spick and span property			0
however , the owners of this cottage have let weeds run rampant in the garden and the plants seem to have claimed a @entity105 and several motorhomes - seemingly abandoned outside - as their own			0
the owners have been trying to sell the property since , at least , october and have now received an offer the property originally went on the market for £ 299,950 but the asking price was bumped up to £ 320,000 @entity113 , managing director of online estate agents @entity115 , told the @entity116 sunday : ' i do find it amazing that the agents do n't politely suggest that the vendor spends a weekend clearing that lot up			1
' while it is unknown how much the owner has been offered for the cottage , the average selling price for similar , nearby properties is £ 305,000			1
both @entity86 and @entity126 were unavailable for comment last night .			0
