when @entity1 the cat went missing , offers from neighbours to help look for him were few and far between			2
instead , the atmosphere near his home was one of distinct relief			2
for the residents of @entity10 , @entity11 , thought they had at last seen the rather aggressive back of the five - year - old @entity13 they nicknamed ‘ @entity15 cat ’			1
@entity1 is said to have terrorised the area , attacking dogs and residents			1
one victim , retired lieutenant colonel @entity19 , 77 , spent six days in hospital after @entity1 mauled his right arm and sank his teeth into his left thumb all the way to the bone			2
watching : @entity1 looks out of the window of his house in @entity10 , @entity11 hungry : oscar the cat was caught stealing food but to the regret of mr @entity19 and his neighbours , @entity1 , who vanished on october 17 , is now back home – safe and sound			1
he turned up at an empty house in @entity37 , 25 miles away , and had been muscling in on food put out for the owners ’ pets by a cat sitter			2
his behaviour was so bad the cat sitter has refused to help out ever again			2
determined to get rid of him , the homeowner had @entity1 scanned by a vet , who found the details on his microchip			2
he arrived back in @entity10 on saturday – where villagers are arming themselves with water pistols			1
one , who asked not to be named , admitted many had hoped the only way @entity1 would ever return would be ‘ in a body bag ’			2
‘ children ca n’t walk down the alley to the school , ’ said another			0
‘ they all know about the cat and they are all frightened it ’s going to get them			0
’ describing @entity1 as ‘ ferocious ’ , mr @entity19 added : ‘ he can be very aggressive and will even attack dogs and people around the village			1
’ only owner @entity66 , 36 , was pleased at the return of @entity1 , also known as the ‘ @entity68 ’ , who she has had since he was a kitten			0
mr @entity19 ( left ) now uses a water pistol to defend himself against @entity1			1
scars of the animal 's attack can be seen on his arm ( right ) beware : @entity1 's terraced home in @entity10 , @entity76 , where he has been terrorising neighbours she said : ‘ when i got the call i asked “ is he okay and alive ? ’ ’ the vet said “ he ’s very much alive and causing problems ’ ’			1
i said “ that ’s @entity1 – he ’s okay ’ ’			0
i am super-happy to have him back			0
i never ever gave up but i was definitely starting to lose faith			0
life just was n’t the same without him			0
‘ because of his bad boy antics i hoped , if he was still okay , he would stay true to form and make himself known at a house where cats already lived and where somebody would know what to do rather than get angry with him			0
‘ it seems ironic now that it was his notorious bad behaviour that brought him back to me			0
’ but miss @entity66 , a telecoms worker , defended her pet , saying he was so lovable he had even appeared in an @entity103 advert in 2010 – and insisted he never attacked children or dogs			1
‘ the fact that people are saying they want @entity1 dead is awful			1
' i ca n’t believe anyone would say that , ’ she said			0
miss @entity66 is now looking into herbal therapy to treat @entity1 ’s aggression , and is planning to move to a house with a large and secure garden for him to roam			0
in the meantime , she has put him under house arrest			0
@entity119 , originally from @entity120 in the east of modern @entity122 , are a powerful breed sometimes referred to as ‘ dogs in a cat suit ’			1
no messing : oscar the cat is well - known in the village of @entity10 left , mr @entity19 's window frame was attacked by @entity1			1
right , mr @entity19 's cat @entity129 is terrified by @entity1 loyal : @entity66 defended her cat @entity1 , claiming he has ' a lot of character ' she said she felt like she had to leave home because of the unfair way her neighbours were treating @entity1			0
she said : ' @entity1 has a lot of character			0
' he is a lively cat but the accusations some people are making about him are just not true			1
' he has never attacked children or dogs			1
' @entity1 did attack one of my neighbours once but my neighbour had scared him when he tried to pick him up			0
' he even appeared in a @entity103 tv commercial - so if he was that vicious how on earth would they have filmed him in that			1
' the fact that people are saying they want @entity1 dead is just awful - i ca n't believe anyone would say that			1
' he is a great cat - it has all got too much and i think i am going to have to move home			1
' ms @entity66 has two other cats , who are both @entity1 's brothers			0
@entity1 appeared twice in an @entity103 advert - firstly walking towards the camera ( left ) and then in another shot putting his head through a bed frame ( right ) cute ? oscar the cat has an outwardly sweet appearance			2

residents in @entity10 , @entity11 , now carry water pistols for *protection*
