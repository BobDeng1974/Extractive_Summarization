people with a food allergy are more likely to be murdered than to die from a severe allergic reaction , new research has found			1
one in 10 children have an allergy and their parents often worry about the dangers of a severe reaction , or anaphylaxis			0
now researchers at @entity11 have calculated the risk of a person with a food allergy dying from anaphylaxis			1
people with food allergies , such as to seafood and peanuts , are more likely to be murdered than to die from a severe allergic reaction			1
they have a 1.8 in a million chance of dying from a reaction in a year based on data from 13 studies , they say the risk in one year is 1.8 in a million			1
for children and young people , the risk of 3.25 in a million			2
by comparison , in @entity31 the risk of being murdered is 11 in a million and the risk of dying in an accident is 324 in a million during a year			1
dr @entity35 , from the @entity36 at @entity11 , who led the study , said : ‘ everyone has heard stories of people who have died suddenly from a severe allergic reaction , and these stories are frightening			2
' but events like this appear to be very rare , and it 's helpful to put that risk in perspective			0
‘ we do n't want to belittle the concerns of people with food allergies or their families , and of course people should continue to take reasonable precautions			2
‘ that said , we want to reassure them that having a food allergy makes a very small difference to someone 's overall risk of death			0
children and young people with a food allergy have a 3.25 in a million chance of dying from a severe allergic reaction in a year			1
image shows a child using an @entity68 ‘ worrying about severe allergic reactions can take a huge toll on someone 's quality of life			0
‘ we should address anxiety and quality of life for food allergic people and their carers , rather than just focus on the risk of death			0
’ food allergies are becoming more common and hospital admissions for children with food allergies have risen five-fold in the last 20 years .			0

the risk of a person with a food allergy dying from an allergic reaction in one year is 1.8 in a million , for children and *teenagers* it is 3.25 in a million
the risk of being murdered in @entity31 is 11 in a million each year , while the risk of dying in an accident is 324 in a million during a year
researchers say they do n't want to belittle the concerns of people with allergies , but are trying to *highlight* the risk of dying is very rare
