by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:05 am on 5th march 2012 families of july 7 bombing victims and soldiers killed by ‘ friendly fire ’ have condemned the government ’s secret justice plans as a ‘ dictator ’s charter ’			2
they said proposals to hold inquests and civil cases behind closed doors could rob families of the right to see justice done			2
they join a chorus of concern expressed by politicians of all parties about justice secretary @entity23 ’s plan to allow ‘ sensitive ’ cases to be heard in private			1
devastation : the aftermath of after the bomb blast on a bus in @entity30 , @entity31 , on july 7 , 2005			0
in future inquests into such terror attacks could be held in private , stopping details being revealed to the public the reforms , detailed in a @entity37 on justice and security , would grant the state ‘ dictator ’ powers and allow the security services to hush up their mistakes , said @entity45 , whose 22 - year - old son @entity46 was killed in the @entity48 blast on july 7 , 2005			1
many of the failings by @entity51 and the police over the @entity31 bomb atrocities could still be shrouded in secrecy were it not for the public inquest			1
both organisations had been previously cleared of blame for the bombings by @entity61 ’s @entity60			0
mr @entity45 said : ‘ @entity62 does n’t contain adequate safeguards to prevent the state abusing the powers it would have			1
killed on 7/7 : the father of @entity68 said the bill would grant the state ' dictator ' powers and allow the security services to hush up their mistakes ‘ our experience of @entity51 gave us some insight into the ability of @entity51 to cry “ national security ” and the politicians to roll over and play dead			1
‘ the @entity60 was misled by @entity51 , so @entity51 got away with attempts to hide their errors			1
‘ giving agents of the state the powers of a dictator and dressing it up as being in the interests of the state is not right			1
’ @entity97 , whose @entity98 son @entity98 was accidentally shot by a @entity100 sniper , said : ‘ the plans for secret court cases are appalling , the public needs to hear what is said			1
many things have come to light that have led to changes such as the lack of body armour for soldiers			0
’ the inquest into the death of 22 - year - old @entity105 in december 2009 is due to be held in may , before the government ’s plans would come into effect			2
but mrs @entity97 , 49 , from @entity109 , is angered that cases like her son ’s could be held in secret			2
she said : ‘ i would be devastated if i was denied access to the inquest into my son ’s death			2
it ’s essential to me that we get to the truth			0
i do n’t think they have the right to keep this information from me			0
these new rules are n’t needed			0
i understand there are certain parts of @entity98 ’s inquest that need to be kept secret because of the nature of his job			2
‘ but the current rules mean that people can give evidence behind screens or that certain things are heard in private , there is no need for change			1
’ adamant : @entity23 's @entity137 has defended its proposals on the grounds that security services have been hamstrung in defending themselves against allegations of wrongdoing in open court mistakes : three of the four 7/7 bombers - @entity147 , left , @entity148 , centre , and @entity150 , right			1
it emerged at an inquest that some of them were already known to intelligence @entity156 , the lawyer representing many 7/7 survivors and families of the victims , said of the government ’s proposals : ‘ it is a shocking idea for so many reasons			1
‘ the unprecedented openness of the evidence in the 7/7 inquests has improved , rather than harmed , national security			2
‘ the coroner was able to make recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the security service			0
‘ the government ’s proposals are a cynical , self - serving attempt to defeat legitimate claims and stifle the revelation of facts to which the public are entitled			2
‘ the government says that the proposals are the only way there can be a fair trial when evidence involving issues of national security is involved			0
while that may be true for the government , it means that other parties who are denied access to that evidence can not possibly have a fair trial			0
they will not see or hear the evidence and will not have an opportunity of testing it			0
’ destruction : a @entity199 tube train after the explosion			0
the 7/7 attack was one of the worst ever terror attacks on @entity205 soil , and the worst to hit @entity31 the conduct of the security services was also exposed in the case of @entity210 , the @entity205 resident tortured at @entity211			1
the government fought and lost a lengthy legal battle to keep secret what a judge eventually called mr @entity210 ’s ‘ cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment ’			0
' @entity217 ' : the government fought and lost a lengthy legal battle to keep secret @entity205 security services ' role in the torture of @entity210 @entity223 of the campaigning legal charity @entity224 , which represented mr @entity210 , said : ‘ the real driver for the government ’s plans is not national security , but political embarrassment			0
‘ they are seeking to abolish the very legal method by which we first found out that @entity205 had become mixed up in some of the worst excesses of the “ war on terror ”			0
‘ the proposals would leave ministers in effect immune from having to answer for their mistakes , so long as they made the claim that “ sensitive information ” was involved			0
’ the @entity137 has defended its proposals on the grounds that the security services have been hamstrung in defending themselves against allegations of wrongdoing , because they can not reveal secret intelligence material in open court			1
but lawyers and human rights groups have countered that there already mechanisms in courts by which ‘ sensitive ’ evidence can be heard in secret .			1

@entity137 plan would allow ' sensitive ' cases to be heard in private
public inquest into 7/7 attacks revealed many failings of police and @entity51
victim 's father *accuses* the state of seeking ' dictator ' powers
