five men have been poisoned in @entity1 after allegedly asking a restaurant to serve them banned parts of the world 's most toxic fish			1
the men were having dinner on friday night in the western city of @entity9 when they ate puffer fish liver , which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning			1
puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in @entity1 - are the world 's most toxic group of fish and their livers , ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin , 100 times more lethal than cyanide			1
dicing with death : five @entity1 men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish ( file photo ) yet eating the fish 's flesh is a tradition in @entity1 , where wealthy diners play the @entity34 roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent			1
according to a city health official , the men asked to eat a banned , toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips			1
popular : the tradition of eating thin slices of ' fugu ' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year the tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning , and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish			0
but if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles , suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious			0
the health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation			1
' they consumed a dinner that included liver , which is regarded as toxic material , ' she told @entity73 , reading from a statement			0
calls to the restaurant went unanswered			0
chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail			0
the most prized species is the tiger puffer , takifugu rubripes , whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver , ovaries and intestine can all kill			2
it is not clear which species of puffer fish the men ate			2
puffer fish account for the majority of @entity1 's food poisoning deaths but the delicacy shows no sign of dying out , although it is heavily regulated			2
government figures show 30 to 50 people are hospitalised every year , with a few of those cases leading to death .			0
