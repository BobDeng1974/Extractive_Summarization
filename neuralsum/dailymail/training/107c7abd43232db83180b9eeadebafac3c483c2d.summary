by @entity0 with just over two weeks to go to kick - off , @entity2 chiefs may have a new concern on their hands with the playing surface at the @entity7 in a shocking state			1
it may be the spiritual home of ' @entity10 ' , but with 16 days until the tournament begins and 19 days until it hosts @entity12 and @entity13 in its first match , it does n't look like anyone will be playing beautiful football on the hallowed ground any time soon			1
@entity18 staged a final run - through of the @entity21 venue on monday and while the stadium itself is good to go , the surface is anything but			2
the @entity7 pitch looked unfit for even a casual kickabout , such was its terribly scarred , pock - marked appearance			1
it may be suited more to beach football if the piles of sand being applied to it were anything to go by as teams of groundsmen tackled the brown surface			2
poor : ground staff try to get @entity21 's @entity7 playing surface into a better condition @entity41 : ground staff survey the playing surface , which is brown and has had sand added to it first up : the @entity7 hosts @entity46 in just 19 days when @entity12 meet @entity13 just last week , iconic goalkeeper @entity47 blasted the @entity7 , blaming the pitch for his @entity51 side 's 5 - 2 loss to @entity52 in the @entity54 top flight			1
it echoed plenty of previous warnings over the issue			0
the surface came in for criticism during last year 's @entity62 final , cutting up badly underfoot as @entity63 trounced @entity64			0
then last october it was relaid after @entity67 goalkeeper @entity66 , part of @entity63 's 2014 squad , said that it was unfit for international football			0
by that time it had played host to a beyond intensive 33 matches in five months			0
however stadium and local organising chiefs appear to have not only failed to learn their lesson but inexplicably heaped even more action onto the replacement pitch			0
by @entity80 's tally , the @entity7 has hosted an astonishing 37 competitive games between january 19 and may 18 - a period of just 17 weeks			1
by comparison the @entity83 staged 29 games in all competitions over the course of nine months last season , @entity89 26			0
overused ? the maracana stadium has hosted 37 competitive matches in just 17 weeks , putting strain on the pitch the @entity21 arena will also be the most overworked playing field in the tournament with seven matches taking place there			1
after the @entity12 - @entity13 clash , it plays host to the meeting of @entity64 and @entity104 on june 18 , @entity106 's clash with @entity107 on june 22 , @entity109 's final group match against @entity110 three days later , a last - 16 tie and a quarter final before the tournament decider on july 13			1
organisers , who told @entity54 media this morning that @entity18 were working ' to guarantee that the grass will be rooted and fixed ' in time for the tournament , will be hoping for a miraculous repair job			0
after delayed stadiums and unfinished infrastructure projects , a playing surface unfit for purpose at a @entity2 final venue would be unforgivable			0
strain : the @entity7 pitch is to host seven matches during the @entity2 , seven more than any other stadium			2

@entity21 's *showcase* @entity7 pitch in poor condition
the brown surface is scarred , pock - marked and has had sand added to it
goalkeeper @entity47 the latest player to blame the surface after his @entity51 team were beaten by @entity139 on it
the @entity7 has hosted 37 competitive matches in just 17 weeks
the stadium 's first @entity2 match is just 19 days away : @entity12 vs @entity13
it will host seven matches during the tournament , more than any other stadium
