by @entity0 @entity1 was spotted having a knock - about at the @entity3 with an enormous growth protruding from his elbow			1
in what appeared to be a severe case of tennis elbow , the former world no 1 had a lump almost the size of a tennis ball sticking out of the back of his arm			2
the 46 - year - old , who won the @entity17 himself in 1989 , is at the tournament as current world no 1 @entity21 's coach			1
lump : the large bump did not stop the former world number one from going for a knock - up on a practice court ouch : the lump looks sore but @entity1 , who is @entity28 champion @entity21 's coach , carries on but it seems the former @entity31 star , who won @entity28 three times in the 1980s , as well as three @entity34 opens and one @entity35 , needs to put his racket down and give his arm a rest			1
@entity1 was only named as the @entity40 's coach last year but the huge lump on his elbow may be a sign he needs a rest			1
surprisingly the lump is on his left arm , suggesting the injury may not be tennis - related as he is a right - handed player			2
@entity49 : @entity1 's injury may not be tennis - related as it is on his left hand and he is a right - hander ball : the lump on @entity1 's elbow is similarly sized to the balls used at the @entity3 in @entity57 @entity58 cruises through in @entity57 tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow			1
it is caused by the overuse of the muscles of the forearm , often through activities that place repeated stress on the elbow joint , such as playing tennis or @entity73 and anti-inflammatory drugs can ease the pain , while severe cases can require physiotherapy or even surgery			0
however , in @entity1 's case , the mystery lump on his left arm may not be the result of tennis elbow ; particularly because he is right - @entity84 , it could have resulted from a sudden injury - such as a blow to the elbow , causing bleeding or fluid build - up - or infection			1
tennis elbow lasts between six months and two years			0
however , in about nine out of 10 cases , a full recovery is made within a year			0
however @entity1 will have to go careful on the double - handed backhands for the time being , especially when facing this year 's @entity28 champion , @entity21			1
fans spotted the lump on @entity1 's left elbow was he watched the @entity40 breeze past @entity100 player @entity99 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 today			1
but more pictures of the uncomfortable - looking bump appeared later on as photographers watched @entity1 having a knock - up at the @entity106 stadium court at the @entity107 in @entity57			2
@entity21 , who said he enjoyed playing in the late evening slot at the @entity3 , next plays @entity109			2
djokovic and @entity111 are on course to face each other in the quarter finals should they both reach that stage			0
@entity111 laboured to beat @entity117 @entity116 yesterday over four sets			0
it is not all work for @entity1 , however			0
he was seen relaxing in the @entity122 district of @entity123 , @entity57 yesterday with his wife @entity124			0
the couple were seen laughing and kissing as mrs @entity126 sipped on a glass of wine			0
