by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor banning elderly people from swimming pool lanes , fairground rides or mobile phone shops is illegal under discrimination laws , the equality watchdog has warned			1
shops , leisure centres , nightclubs , theatres and guest houses are warned against discriminating against customers on the basis of their age			1
new guidance from the @entity17 sets out dozens of ways companies , charities and public bodies could fall foul of the law			1
older people can not be banned from swimming pools just because they swim too slowly and might get in the way , the eq2aulity watchdog has warned a fairground which bans the over- 70s from a centrifuge ride because memory problems means they will forget safety rules would be breaking the law			1
a theatre would be guilty of age discrimination if it only gives entry to a variety show to people who remember what life was like during the @entity38			1
if gym imposed a fitness test for new members to do 30 press ups it could be breaking the law			1
the guidance suggests a 70 year - old - man could provide ' statistical evidence from a reputable source that people in his age group are unlikely to be able to do 30 press ups as upper body strength decreases with age '			1
' if the gym can not objectively justify the requirement , it will be unlawful , ' the guidance adds			2
a school swimming pool which bans a man in his 80s because they think he ‘ will swim so slowly that he will get in the way of other pool users ’ would also be in breach of the rules			0
fairgrounds and pubs can not turn people away based solely on their age , the guidance states a six - week consultation has now begun on the new guidance , before it is approved by @entity71			1
@entity72 , chief executive of the @entity17 , said : ‘ we hope the supplementary code will be valuable and helpful to businesses , public authorities , courts , lawyers and advocates and we want to hear from as many people as possible so we can provide the best possible guidance			1
‘ this consultation will enable us to refine and improve our final product and provide high quality , relevant assistance in complying with equality laws			0
’ the guidance explains the law on age discrimination , but there are many opt - outs , exemptions and concessions which can apply			1
it is possible to give less favourable treatment to certain age groups if it has a ‘ legitimate aim ’ which includes outcomes that are ‘ socially positive or in the public interest ’			2
this includes allowing people of a certain age to socialise together , for instance at an over- 50s social club or an under - 30s rambling group			2
it also covers the right for ‘ people of certain age groups to enjoy peace and quiet or enabling them to enjoy music at high volume ’			2
the @entity17 has produced new guidance on age discrimination for business , charities and state bodies			1
it says the 70 - page rule book is needed to ensure customers are protected and firms know the opt - outs and exemptions that can be used			2
here are some of the examples included in the new guidance , which will be voted on by @entity71 : a man of 50 wearing jeans tries to enter a club which generally attracts a much younger clientele			0
the person on the door turns the man away stating that he does not meet the club ’s dress code			0
it later emerges that on the same evening a 25 year old man in jeans was allowed in by the same person			0
this is evidence that the reason why the 50 year old was excluded was not primarily because of his dress but because of his age			0
it is likely to be direct age discrimination if the club which bans under 25s refuses to admit a man age 30 because from his appearance they ( wrongly ) assume he is under 25			1
the manager of a mobile phone shop decides that the shop will no longer deal with retired customers			1
this age group tends to need more support and guidance from staff when they buy phones , and the manager wants to cut back on staff numbers to reduce overheads			2
the aim of reducing costs alone would not be a legitimate one			0
the aim of less favourable treatment should not be based on a stereotype about age			0
sometimes a service provider may have some aims that are legitimate mixed with aims that are illegitimate , such as those linked to stereotypes			0
a fairground concessionaire believes that people over 70 have memory problems			0
this belief leads the concessionaire to ban them from the centrifuge ride because he thinks they will not remember safety instructions			0
while the aim of reducing health and safety risks is legitimate , the concessionaire ’s belief about this age group is based on a stereotype rather than on supporting evidence			2
therefore the aim of reducing safety risks for this age group can not be a legitimate one			2
a variety theatre performance restricts admission to people who can remember what life was like during the @entity38			0
it claims this is a neutral requirement			0
the reality is that only people who were alive during the @entity38 will gain admission			0
this policy could amount to direct age discrimination against those too young to satisfy the requirement , unless it can be objectively justified			1
a secondary school has a swimming pool which it allows members of the public to use at weekends when pupils are not at school			0
when a man in his 80s wants to use the pool , the school ’s life guard refuses to let him do so because he thinks the man will swim so slowly that he will get in the way of other pool users			0
this is likely to amount to direct age discrimination by the school , unless it can be objectively justified .			1
