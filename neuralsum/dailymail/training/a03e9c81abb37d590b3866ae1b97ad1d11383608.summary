by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 8 march 2013 a major victory was scored over the wind farm lobby yesterday when plans to build giant turbines near one of the nation ’s finest elizabethan gardens were halted			1
a high court judge ruled that preserving historic settings was of greater importance than meeting renewable energy targets			1
mrs @entity12 said the bid to build four 430ft high turbines at @entity16 on farmland owned by the @entity19 ’s cousin , the @entity13 , was legally flawed			1
the future : @entity21 criticised plans to build a wind farm next to @entity24 in @entity25 protests : @entity27 , chairman of @entity28 - which opposed the development - at @entity24 the structures would have overshadowed @entity24 in @entity25 , which has one of @entity33 ’s oldest garden landscapes and features an unfinished 17th - century tudor garden lodge			1
the battle to save it was led by the @entity21 and @entity36 , who hailed the ruling as a significant victory			1
conservationists had warned approval would undermine the protection of other important sites			0
@entity44 , @entity21 director of conservation , said : ‘ it is a huge judgement in favour of conserving our historic landscapes			1
’ the charity is opposing or monitoring around 25 applications for wind farms amid concern over their impact on the countryside or heritage sites			0
mr @entity44 said yesterday ’s ruling would strengthen its hand in future battles			0
‘ it sends an important signal that areas of outstanding beauty or national significance need protecting and are unsuitable for these developments , ’ he said			0
‘ although it is not a legal precedent , this can only help			0
’ change of direction : the application asked for permission to erect four turbines just a kilometre away from the building which would have been visible from every part of the site ( file photo ) @entity36 chief executive @entity77 said : ‘ we are very pleased			2
the effect of the turbines on one of the most important , beautiful and unspoilt @entity83 landscapes in @entity33 would be appalling			2
’ this week , @entity21 chairman sir @entity84 said communities were complaining almost daily of a wind farm or housing proposal in a sensitive landscape			1
mrs @entity12 ruled that a planning inspector had failed to ‘ accord special weight ’ or importance to ‘ the desirability of preserving the setting ’			1
she said the case must now be reconsidered			0
the @entity16 wind farm was rejected by the district council in 2010 after strong local opposition			0
but after the developers appealed , public inquiry inspector @entity98 approved it in march last year , saying green targets must come first			2
@entity103 , deputy chief executive of @entity104 , which represents the wind farm industry , denied a precedent has been set as proposals are dealt with case by case			0
' unique ' : the government said @entity24 was arguably the most ambitious and unusual surviving example of an @entity83 garden in @entity33			2

@entity21 fought against the development arguing it would blight ' @entity116 *'s* finest elizabethan garden '
planning inspector *backed* appeal by energy firm to build turbines there
