@entity1 the horse will probably be able to keep his name after a public outcry from other @entity4 a one - tonne , 6ft - tall police horse called @entity1 is set to keep his name , despite fears it needs to be called something tougher to face rioters			1
@entity10 said @entity1 is an unsuitable name for a horse and mooted calling the six - year - old something more ' war - like ' , such as @entity15 or @entity16			1
but the force has now backed down , following protests from other men called @entity1 , who said the possible change would be a slur on their good name			1
a spokesman for the force said : ' following a lot of protests , it looks like @entity1 may keep his name			1
' @entity29 , the winner of @entity31 series eight , said ' this is a victory for @entity33 everywhere			0
' it 's a solid name and a strong name - think of @entity37 's @entity36 , about @entity38			1
' i think it 's a marvellous name for a horse , it 's a friendly name , you would want to be kept safe by a @entity1			1
' the force had admitted that its usual policy was to give their horses ' macho ' names such as @entity49 or @entity50			0
one mare called @entity53 became @entity54 , and another horse called @entity56 became @entity57 , it said			0
but dozens of @entity33 soon began posting comments about the name online , questioning why it was not ' strong enough ' for a horse			0
it led to a growing campaign , with many using the hashtag # @entity64 to show their support to the horse			0
among those who complained was @entity68 from @entity69 , who said : ' i think it 's outrageous			0
@entity1 is a good name for a horse			1
' and @entity74 , from @entity75 in @entity76 , said he was ' appalled ' at the police name - change plan			2
' there is no way they should be changing it ... every horse should be called @entity1 ! ' the shire horse must now pass six weeks of training before he is kept on by the force			1
the tests include @entity1 going out on patrol in town centres and tests to see if he can cross bridges and trot through underpasses			2
@entity10 had said the horse ( pictured ) would be given a more ' war - like ' name such as @entity15 @entity10 encouraged other @entity4 to discuss the name saga , using the hashtag # @entity96 the force originally said that , if he passed the test , @entity1 would be scratched from the records and replaced with a more ' fitting ' name			1
labrador @entity102 ( right ) , from @entity104 , with @entity105 @entity107 - actor @entity108 - guitarist from @entity109 @entity112 - @entity111 footballer and manager @entity116 - former @entity115 cricketer @entity118 - @entity117 rugby player @entity120 from @entity121 @entity122 - former @entity111 rugby star @entity124 - guitarist from the @entity125 @entity29 - @entity31 series 8 winner @entity129 - singer and songwriter from the @entity131 @entity133 - @entity132 actor @entity102 - fictional character from @entity104 @entity36 - cult film it said that @entity1 needed a more ' @entity138 - like ' name to face rioters or troublesome football crowds			1
but a force spokesman told @entity142 today that @entity1 was not certain to keep his name but that it was ' likely '			2
he said the decision would be made once the horse has passed his training			2
@entity1 was chosen from @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 , where he had been since 2013			2
he has been taken on to replace @entity150 , a seven - year - old shire horse , who suffered from peritonitis and died suddenly in his stables six months ago			0
@entity156 @entity155 , of the @entity157 , said @entity1 is so far doing well in the tests			0
she said : ' he has seen a lot of hazards - things you would expect to scare normal horses			0
' with a horse , even pushchairs can be a hazard because they are not something they would normally see on a regular basis			0
' a horse can have many personality changes in a six - week period , but so far @entity1 has not put a hoof wrong			1
' she added : ' i am 50/50 with him at the moment			0
he is certainly on his way and so far he has not given us any reason to doubt him , but it is very early days			0

6ft - tall horse is *undergoing* six weeks of training with @entity10
@entity185 usually gives horses a ' war - like ' name such as @entity15
it *sparked* outrage among other @entity4 who rallied against name change
@entity185 said it is now likely to keep @entity1 's name , if he passes the training
