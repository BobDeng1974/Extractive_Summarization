tragedy : the parents of @entity2 were told he was dead , only for the baby to be rushed to intensive care 36 minutes after his traumatic birth doctors told a first time mother her baby was dead only for the infant to start breathing and be rushed into intensive care 36 minutes after his traumatic birth , an inquest heard			1
midwives had expected @entity15 , 33 , to give birth after eight hours , but she was only offered a caesarean - section after seven further hours of difficulties delivering naturally			1
when her baby @entity20 was born , weak and barely breathing , mrs @entity19 said she saw a ' look of dread and panic ' on the faces of maternity staff - some who were reduced to tears during the delivery			1
staff at @entity30 in @entity31 battled to revive him for 20 minutes before paediatrian dr @entity33 told her : ' i think dad knows what i ’m about to say			1
unfortunately there was nothing we could do			0
' however , around 36 minutes after his birth @entity20 suddenly took a ' couple of breaths ' and was rushed into intensive care			1
he was kept in hospital for a further five weeks before being sent home by doctors - to the surprise of his parents			1
@entity20 , was left severely brain damaged after his brain was starved of oxygen during the birth , died aged only three months after he stopped breathing during a feeding session			1
at the inquest into her baby 's death @entity59 , a travel firm consultant , claimed the length of the labour may have cost her son his life			1
' i think labour went on incredibly long , ' said @entity59 , of @entity30			1
' i felt it should have been recognised that i had delivery problems naturally			0
' after that lunchtime period i felt i was just left			2
it was n’t staffing issues because i had two midwives			0
i was n’t a priority , i was a first time mum having a long labour			2
' when asked about having a caesarean - section sooner she told the hearing in @entity77 : ' i feel that it may have saved my baby ’s life			1
letting me push the way i did , they could n’t get him out			0
i think that maybe in hindsight i would be demanding a c - section			1
parents : @entity87 and @entity15 believe their son might have survived if his mother had been offered a caesarean section earlier in her labour ' i would have asked for an earlier delivery			1
i felt they left me a long time			2
if they had to put me on a drip things were n’t going particularly normally			0
i just feel like something could have been done earlier			2
' the tragedy occurred after @entity59 , who conceived @entity20 after fertility treatment and had a normal pregnancy , was admitted to @entity30 at 1am on may 17 2011 when her waters broke			1
midwives were initially happy with her progress and there was no suggestion she was at risk			0
' i was told that i was fully dilated and everything seemed to be progressing normally , ' she told the hearing			2
' but by 10am i never really got a really strong urge to push , if anything things seem to be slowing down			0
by mid-morning contractions started to diminish and after midday i was reviewed by a consultant			0
birth : staff at @entity30 in @entity31 battled to revive @entity20 for 20 minutes before paediatrian dr @entity33 told his mother : ' unfortunately there was nothing we could do ' ' yet there was never any mention of there being any concerns with the baby ’s heart rate			1
i was reassured everything was going as normal			0
' mrs @entity59 later had an epidural to help her push for longer but by 3pm there was still so sign of her baby and she was taken to theatre for a caesarean section at 4pm			1
during the procedure it was discovered @entity20 ’s head had become stuck in his mother ’s pelvis with doctors struggling to extricate him			1
he was left with severe brain damage after being starved of oxygen and suffering a fractured skull and bleed on the brain			1
mrs @entity59 said : ' being a first time mum you expect a longer labour and there was nothing for me to be concerned about			2
the midwife were so reassuring , that i was heading towards a normal natural delivery			0
breathing : around 36 minutes after his birth @entity20 suddenly took a ' couple of breaths ' and was rushed into intensive care			1
he was kept in hospital for a further five weeks before being sent home by doctors ' there was never anything to make me feel there was concerns - until after 3pm			2
it was then i remember thinking " i ’m sure my baby should be born by this point "			1
i remember the midwife saying you should have had this baby born by 9am			1
' i started to think why is it taking all this time			0
i remember the midwife saying she was going to find someone because they had not been to check on me for some time			0
' a c - section was mentioned as a back up and i put all my faith in them to make the decision			1
if i had any concerns i would have asked to go in for a c - section earlier			1
' i would never have put my baby at risk			2
i thought this was the natural progression and this was best for my baby			2
tender : mr @entity59 with his baby son , who was left with severe brain damage after the traumatic birth ' in theatre there was no sense of urgency or panic and then the atmosphere totally changed			1
there was a sense of panic on people ’s faces , a look of dread on people ’s faces			0
i knew something was n’t right			0
' mrs @entity59 told the hearing that when her baby was born he did not cry , and she knew that something was wrong as she looked at her husband			1
' i knew from @entity87 ’s face that something was n’t right and then it was when dr @entity33 came and told me that unfortunately he had not made it , ' she said			1
' i remember lying there and @entity87 sat at the side of me holding my hand			1
i remember asking why my baby was not crying			0
everybody ’s faces said it all			0
' then dr @entity33 said , " i think dad knows what i ’m about to say that unfortunately there was nothing we could do "			0
i always remember those words			0
' i was in shock			0
all i was thinking was ‘ this was my fault , how can i not deliver him ’			0
i was taken to recovery to try and digest the news that this baby we were having had been born with no signs of life			1
' however , later in the recovery room another doctor told the couple @entity20 was in fact in intensive care on a ventilator and he was transferred to @entity239 in @entity240			1
she added : ' nobody ever mentioned life expectancy to us because nobody could tell us			0
there was a lot of confusion what was actually wrong with him			0
his heart stopped on a couple of occasions			2
we were even woken up at 3am to get him christened			0
' they could n’t tell us what ability he would have , if he would have any motor skills			0
it was a waiting game			0
it was a case of taking every day as it came			0
' mr @entity59 , a vehicle technician said in the moments after the birth he saw midwives in tears and added : ' it went from him dying and straight into the intensive care			1
infant : the couple were allowed to take their son home on june 25 after they were given just a short demonstration on administering cpr if he collapsed ' after he had died he was in recovery			2
the doctor told us that he had never seen it before , that the baby had taken a couple of breaths and they have resuscitate him			1
' @entity20 regained consciousness but doctors told the family he had a ' very limited ' life expectancy			1
the couple were allowed to take their son home on june 25 after they were given just a short demonstration on administering cpr if he collapsed			0
mr @entity59 said : ' i was quite astonished @entity20 being sent home later when we knew very little about his condition and the way we should approach the condition			2
' we only got very little resuscitation lessons and i remember saying to @entity300 we should know more			2
' he was never expected to live as long as he did			0
i remember receiving a letter saying cerebral palsy			0
' condition : throughout his short life @entity20 had to be fed through a tube			2
his condition deteriorated and on august 14 he was rushed back into hospital where he was pronounced dead throughout his short life @entity20 had to be fed through a tube			1

i did not expect @entity20 to survive , i believed the outcome was inevitable			2
' i believe i said that i did not expect @entity20 to survive			2
