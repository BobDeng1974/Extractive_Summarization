@entity0 are facing a fight to keep @entity3 international @entity2 , with a host of clubs pursuing the signature of the prolific winger			1
@entity8 can reveal that , although contract talks have opened with the @entity11 , the 27 - year - old has yet to sign an extended deal			2
that has alerted clubs from the @entity15 , the top 14 in @entity17 and also in the southern hemisphere to his possible availability			1
@entity0 's @entity2 is yet to sign a new contract with the club , alerting potential suitors the @entity3 wing , pictured scoring against @entity17 in march 2013 , will be much sought - after losing one of @entity3 's top finishers would be a big blow to the rebuilding plans of @entity0 head coach @entity29 , who is believed to be keen for @entity2 to remain at the club			1
but the question is whether the @entity11 will be able to match the big - money offers sure to come his way over the next few months			2
@entity8 understands the player is keen to have his future settled sooner rather than later to allow him to concentrate fully on @entity3 's @entity38 campaign			2
@entity39 - born @entity2 , who made history by becoming the first man to play for @entity3 through the three - year residency rule , has been looking back to his best over the past few months following an injury - hit season			1
his two tries in the 20 - 8 win over @entity47 earlier this month helped secure a vital @entity49 win for his side and the @entity51 - contested by the clubs on an annual basis			2
@entity2 also scored in saturday 's @entity55 defeat to @entity56			1
@entity39 - born @entity2 qualified to play for @entity3 through the three - year residency rule in 2012 the big winger , who joined @entity0 back in 2009 and made his @entity3 debut against @entity60 three years later , is a firm favourite of the fans who will be hoping that he remains at the club past the summer			1
meanwhile , @entity29 will be grateful for some home comforts this week ahead of the @entity66 showdown with @entity67			0
a 75th - minute drop goal in @entity56 inflicted a first defeat in five games of @entity71 on the capital club , who must now win friday night 's clash against the group ' s other @entity17 outfit			1
it was always likely to come down to the last round but defeat in @entity56 has possibly denied @entity0 the safety net of qualifying as a runner - up			1
head coach @entity82 was in forgiving mood in @entity17 after watching a demanding schedule take its toll on his players and their @entity89 ambitions			0
@entity2 ( left ) tries to help team - mate @entity90 ( right ) tackle @entity92 's @entity91 the day - long journey to @entity94 came on the back of a trip to @entity97 , never the simplest of ventures , and a busy festive period that featured back - to - back derbies against @entity102			1
@entity29 believes playing in @entity56 proved a bridge too far for his drained players			2
he said : ' the reasons we lost were relatively simple - we made too many errors and gave away too many penalties			0
' probably 18 of their 21 points came through a combination of those two issues			0
but you have to look at the reasons behind that as to why we were not at our best			0
' that was our ninth game on the bounce			0
we had two massive games against @entity102 over @entity121 , then were away to @entity122 , that involves a flight and three - hour bus journey , and then immediately away in @entity17			0
' that has all been physically and mentally draining on the players , who were unable to peak once again			0
' @entity2 ( left ) , @entity0 's try scorer , challenges @entity56 's @entity129 for the ball during the 21 - 19 loss solomons could forgive the fatigue but not the indiscipline from his players , which proved decisive			1
@entity2 and @entity137 both crossed in the opening 25 minutes to hand @entity0 a dream start that should have paved the way for a second successive win on @entity17 soil			1
but @entity143 paid the price for his team 's collective indiscretions with a yellow card which handed @entity56 a route back			2
their 13 - 3 lead was narrowed to 13 - 10 when @entity151 touched down and @entity56 found belief , capitalising on @entity0 's growing number of handling errors despite three kicks from @entity156			1
this was a missed opportunity but @entity82 has hammered home to his players that their destiny remains in their own hands			0
@entity2 is tackled by @entity164 ' @entity163 while playing for @entity3 in the 2013 @entity165 ' we are disappointed to lose because that was a game we felt we should have won , despite being off our game , ' he added			2
' but one of the first things i told the players in the dressing room is that we are still top of the pool and still in control			0
' we still have everything to play for next weekend and we are determined to put things right			0
hopefully , we will have a big home crowd backing us - like the one we had against @entity102			0
' ' it 's going to be my job to make sure we recover in the right way this week and that the players are physically and mentally fresh for a big game			0

@entity2 has yet to sign a new contract with @entity0
his potential availability will alert @entity15 and @entity190 clubs
@entity39 - born @entity3 winger is a fans ' favourite at @entity195
he scored during @entity0 's 21 - 19 loss to @entity56 on saturday
