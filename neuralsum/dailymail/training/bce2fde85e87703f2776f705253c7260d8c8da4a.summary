by @entity0 @entity1 has fished for decades , yet he 's never witnessed anything to match the sight of dozens of zombie bass eerily rising out of a north @entity6 lake			0
@entity7 like @entity1 spend about $ 48 billion annually fishing for fun , and they like knowing what 's in the water with their bait			0
to provide answers to that question and more , biologists are conducting a study where they use ' electrofishing ' to stun fish in @entity19 lakes			1
momentarily incapacitated by a weak electrical charge that 's fed into the water from a boat equipped with a humming generator , fish large and small floated motionless to the surface during an electrofishing trip last week			1
they were scooped up with a net and placed into an aerated holding tank			0
eyes wide and mouths agape , stunned fish were measured , weighed and checked for illnesses and parasites			1
within a few minutes the animals snapped out of a zombie - like state , and workers put them back in the water to swim away			1
protection groups including @entity41 contend fish feel pain , but electrofishing has become a standard tool for biologists			1
' generally speaking they recover within a few seconds to a couple of minutes , ' he said			0
justice said a slight shock is much easier on fish and other wildlife than the previous practice of dousing a sealed - off cove with a chemical compound called rotenone , which killed fish so they could be scooped out and counted			2
@entity1 was among nine area anglers who went along on a @entity19 research trip last week on @entity74 near @entity75 , and he grinned as one big fish after another floated to the top in a reservoir where he thought there were far fewer and much smaller bass based on his fishing experience			1
' i 've learned there 's a lot of fish in here , ' @entity1 said after a day on the water			2
another fisherman , @entity89 , laughed as a big bass popped to the surface			0
' they 're pulling some 3 - to 4 - pounders regularly and all day we may catch three or four that size , ' said @entity89 , of nearby @entity96			0
is it dead ? @entity19 workers @entity99 , left , and @entity55 , right , are seeing weighing a ' zombie bass ' caught with electrofishing			1
the technique is used to assess the health of both fish and reservoirs justice said data collected during successive years of electrofishing provides biologists with valuable information about how to best manage the lakes , which are some of the most biologically diverse in @entity112			1
the statistics show whether adjustments need to be made to things including water flow , catch limits , stocking programs and water levels , he said			2
' by looking at the overall health and condition of the fish we collect we can tell a lot about what 's going on with the fishery , ' said @entity55			2
a boat is equipped with a pair of fiberglass arms that support a metal pole that hangs off the bow over the water			0
three metal cables hang from the pole into the water , and an insulated wire connects the cables to an electrical generator in the rear of the boat			0
on the hunt ? @entity19 workers are seen electrofishing and looking for ' zombie bass ' to float to the surface with the current flowing and cables in the lake , an operator steps on a foot pedal to electrify the water with a 6 - amp charge that extends outward and downward as much as 8 feet			1
fish within the field are stunned and float to the surface , along with the occasional turtle or snake			1
once in a tank on board the boat , stunned fish appear lifeless as they float atop the water			1
most recover within moments , and some are actively flipping and jumping by the time they are measured			0
of about 200 bass and crappie collected during three hours of electrofishing at @entity74 , every fish went back into the water alive once researchers were done			2
' they look real healthy , ' @entity89 said			0
fishing does n't always mean catching , but @entity1 said seeing how many fish gather around fallen trees and rocks taught him a lesson about where to concentrate while on the water			2
' i think it will help me be a better fisherman , ' he said			0
' a much more patient fisherman , anyway , for sure			0

@entity19 employs ' electrofishing , ' which electrifies water with a small charge
fish are stunned and float to the surface , where they are tested by biologists for illnesses and parasites
snap out of ' zombie - like state ' within a few minutes
protection groups , including @entity41 , contend fish feel pain during *procedure*
@entity127 is used to better determine the health of lakes
