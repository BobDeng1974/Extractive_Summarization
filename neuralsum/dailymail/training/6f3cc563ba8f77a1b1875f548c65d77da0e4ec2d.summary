the 11 - year - old was sick in july when @entity6 took him to the hospital in @entity8 , where doctors diagnosed him with a cold and sent him home			1
a week later , his arm was paralyzed			0

in the midst of panic over @entity32 , the @entity29 positively confirmed 10 instances of enterovirus - @entity34 in the @entity36 area			1
it also confirmed there were 538 cases of the virus nationwide , in 43 states and the @entity42			1

outbreak : the virus struck in 43 states , the @entity42 and in 4 @entity60 provinces , leading doctors to call for the development of a vaccine four children in @entity65 tested positive for enterovirus after being hospitalized for paralysis , according to @entity68			1
