by @entity0 and @entity1 while working behind - the - scenes with celebrities may be a dream job for some , @entity2 says being a stylist is n't as glamorous as it seems			1
the mother - of - one , who 's been in the fashion industry for 14 years , has worked with the likes of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
ms @entity2 , whose own style has evolved from being the @entity23 of @entity24 to classics and comfort , shared some of her favourite shoots and her personal experiences as a celebrity stylist			1
' i really love working with @entity32 [ from packed to the @entity33 ] , ' ms @entity2 told @entity34			1
' she ’s got it all going on			0
she ’s beautiful , a lovely person , down - to - earth and very fun to work with			2
she is is such a warm and humble star and has the beauty of an old @entity40 glamour			0
ms @entity2 made particular mention of a @entity43 shoot where she had the chance to work with loved - up @entity45 and her beau @entity46			1
' it was an amazing shoot and the two had just gotten engaged , ' she said			0
' working with the couple was so easy and it helps that they 're both so gorgeous			2
' celebrity stylist @entity2 has worked with a long list of celebrities ms @entity2 loved working with actress @entity32 ( left ) and her beau @entity46 ( right ) at a shoot in @entity43 model @entity55 pictured at @entity57 in @entity59 's @entity58 while other highlights of her career including being flown around the world by @entity63 to work on their shoots , one of ms @entity2 's memorable location is @entity59 's very own @entity57 in the @entity58			1
' i 've done shoots there a few times and i 've got to say that it 's just breathtakingly beautiful , ' she said			0
so working on set with glamour model @entity55 was no exception			1
' it was a phenomenal shoot but it rained half the day - we could n't believe it , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' we were standing in the desert and thought " what the hell is going on ? "			0
but in the end , that shoot stands out for me because i got to see @entity80 in a different manner compared to all the other commercial campaigns she 's done and i 've worked with her for such a long time			1
' however working on such shoots comes with its demands			2
' it 's so much fun but it 's definitely not glamorous , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' on a day - to - day basis , i 'm either running around in my havaianas or @entity90 and trying to visit 50 different places to grab everything i need for the shoot			2
' by the end of the day i 'm frazzeled , my hair is crazy and i 'm dirty			0
overall it 's a demanding job and the hours are pretty long			1
' @entity98 and husband @entity99 were described as a ' power couple ' by ms @entity2 actress and model @entity20 photographed at @entity102 ms @entity2 also speaks very highly of @entity59 actress @entity103 , who 's pictured at @entity105 's south coast model @entity16 pictured in @entity43 and now comes a new challenge - being a mother			1
' it 's also the best job i have ever had , ' she laughed			2
' but in terms of styling the most challenging would be hands down dressing footballers like the @entity114 and @entity115 only for the fact they have huge thighs , broad chests and shoulders and some it 's almost impossible to fit unless its custom made			0
' ms @entity2 's most star - struck moment would have to be the time she met the late @entity14			1
' it was when he was filming candy and the shoot was for an international magazine cover story , ' she said			2
' he was such a soft and humorous man with this clear , gleaming skin because he had n't been in the sun to look more in character			2
' he chatted openly with all the crew and sat around at lunch like he was an old friend from school - cheeky , handsome and charming			0
' but her most admirable celebrity and style icon is @entity98 - whom ms @entity2 had the chance to style along with husband @entity99			1
' when you grow up admiring someone and then have the chance to work with them , even if it is only playing dress ups for a shoot , it 's perplexing , ' she said			0
' @entity98 is clearly a stunning woman and so talented but she is also such a style icon with a natural sophistication it was - in a lovely way - slightly intimidating			1
' i had n't met @entity99 prior to that shoot and was blown away at his ease and comic charm - the power couple ! ' award - winning actress @entity11 at @entity158 in @entity43 's north shore @entity59 actor @entity12 known for his main role in @entity161 @entity162 - born actress @entity17 in the @entity163 in @entity164 @entity59 singer - songwriter @entity18 ms @entity2 , who originally aspired to be a broadcast journalist but left university when she was offered a job as a beauty editor at @entity169 in 2000 , considers herself very lucky			1
' i did n't think i would end up being somewhat of a celebrity stylist but i 'm very grateful , ' she said			1
' there 's a lot of unglamorous parts and it does give you the real insight that celebrities are as normal as anyone			0
it 's just a job			0
' now that she has her 16 - month - old son , ms @entity2 ' frivolous ' spending days are over and opts for classic black , white and grey colours			1
' i 'm also big on comfort and i love wearing jeans , a t - shirt with a cashmere jumper and a beautiful handbag , ' she said			0
while ms @entity2 plans to continue her future in styling , she also hopes to get back to writing and journalism			2
and her main styling tip : ' do n't try and be something or someone you 're not			0
' ' i think looking good in what you wear comes from feeling confident and comfortable so it should fit well , suit you and your lifestyle , ' she said			0
' it 's like seeing pregnant women or new mums trot around in sky - scraper heels , maybe with the exception of @entity207 who somehow pulls it off			0
it 's dangerous and so impractical			0
or wearing a micro-mini in the middle of winter out to a bar - it 's bad for your health and looks the opposite of sexy			0
' there 's nothing wrong with trying new looks or having fun with fashion but stay true to yourself about what works			0
' @entity2 is represented by @entity225 , @entity43 .			2

@entity2 has worked in the fashion industry for 14 years and has styled a lost list of international and national celebrities
she particularly loves working with @entity32 and @entity55 but @entity98 is her all time favourite
