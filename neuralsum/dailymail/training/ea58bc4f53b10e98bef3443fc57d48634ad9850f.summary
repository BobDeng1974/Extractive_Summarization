by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 18:10 est , 31 december 2012 @entity6 's tax credit system left behind a ‘ sorry story of dependency , wasted taxpayers ’ money and fraud ’ , @entity1 said yesterday as the row over plans to cap payments intensified			1
the @entity12 launched an outspoken attack on the complex tax credit system devised by @entity15 , saying it had been ‘ wide open to abuse ’ , including by foreign criminals			1
the @entity19 ’s new general - secretary @entity18 said mr @entity1 ’s comments marked the return of the ‘ nasty party ’ , while @entity6 accused him of making a ‘ cheap political attack ’ on a scheme relied on by almost six million families			1
outspoken : @entity1 ( left ) launched an attack on @entity15 's ( right ) complex tax credit system but mr @entity1 insisted the tax credit scheme was ‘ not fit for purpose ’			1
he accused @entity6 of deliberately extending the payments to more people in a bid to win votes – warning that the ballooning budget had helped bring the public finances to ‘ breaking point ’			1
he said : ‘ in the years between 2003 and 2010 , @entity6 spent a staggering £ 171 billion on tax credits , contributing to a 60 per cent rise in the welfare bill			1
‘ far too much of that money was wasted , with fraud and error under @entity6 costing over £ 10 billion			2
even for those in genuine need of support , tax credits were not fit for purpose			2
‘ the system was haemorrhaging money while at the same time trapping people in a system where those trying hard to increase the amount of hours they worked were n’t necessarily better off			0
’ @entity55 last month announced plans to cap increases in tax credits to just 1 per cent ministers admitted they did not know how many foreigners were claiming tax credits			2
treasury minister @entity62 recently said ‘ nationality is not a condition of entitlement ’ and was therefore not recorded			0
the @entity66 has disclosed that tax credits are paid to almost 6,000 children living abroad			0
but it does not know how much taxpayers ’ money is being paid to foreign - based families , who are entitled to the @entity74 handouts under @entity76 law			0
@entity55 last month announced plans to cap increases in tax credits to just 1 per cent , in line with restrictions on other working age @entity81 argue that the cap is fair , given the modest increases in wages in recent years			2
but @entity6 has accused ministers of imposing a ‘ strivers ’ tax ’ which will hit millions of low - paid workers , as well as the unemployed			1
tax credits have long been seen as a major source of fraud and error			0
critics claim it would be much cheaper to tax people less in the first place rather than working out complex ways to hand them back part of the money			0
payments are based on estimates of income for the coming year , and after 2008 @entity104 did not attempt to reclaim overpayments of less than £ 25,000			0
that is set to be reduced to £ 5,000 under the @entity66 , alongside moves to require proof of payments from those claiming for childcare .			0
