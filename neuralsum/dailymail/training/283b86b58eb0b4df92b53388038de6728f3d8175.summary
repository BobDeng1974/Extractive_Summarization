the clocks went back last weekend – and how times have changed in the @entity2			0
@entity3 was a dark place for @entity6 manager @entity5			1
only now , as the nights cut in , has the gloom lifted			0
in fact , it ’s as if the sun is beating down upon the once beleaguered boss			0
but for opposite number @entity13 at @entity15 , with autumn has come the fall			1
@entity6 manager @entity5 is pleased with his side 's recent revival , going unbeaten in october @entity6 celebrate as the @entity18 beat @entity19 2 - 0 in the @entity20 on wednesday earlier this month , the pre-match conferences of the two managers clashed			1
just one national journalist ventured to the @entity24 to deliver a few easy , overarm questions to @entity13			2
not that the @entity26 was complaining			0
@entity15 were n’t the story , they were ticking along quietly , picking up enough singles to keep them off the back pages			2
meanwhile , 16 miles up the road on @entity32 , @entity5 – on a decidedly stickier wicket - was batting away bouncers , pace , swing and spin			2
he was the story , odds - on favourite to be the next top - flight manager headed for the pavilion			0
@entity15 boss @entity13 shows his frustrations on the touchline as his side lost 2 - 0 to @entity46 on saturday but then , against @entity48 and again at @entity49 , his team smashed successive boundaries			1
then , at @entity19 in the @entity20 , they knocked everyone for six with a shock 2 - 0 victory			1
meanwhile , at the @entity57 , @entity13 has been on the back foot , the 8 - 0 humiliation at @entity56 followed by an error - ridden 2 - 0 defeat at home to @entity46			1
the temptation to ring fence the @entity64 collapse as a one - off is proving , well , less tempting			0
at their worst this season , @entity15 and @entity6 have borne the same harrowing hallmarks ; jagged in defence – to the point of self - harm – and blunt in attack			1
@entity15 's @entity72 - who made errors in the defeats to @entity46 and @entity56 - could be dropped but it is on @entity76 where those sorry symptoms look set to linger			1
@entity13 continues to talk in riddles – is he happy with the strength and depth of his squad or is n’t he ? you ’d have to side with the latter			2
the players – as shown during the closing stages of last season – are not incapable			0
you have to worry , however , that it took the threat of relegation – and a drop in wages and status – to snap them from their slumber			0
nine new signings have yet to shine , either			0
only @entity97 is holding down a regular starting place , but he has no competition at left back			0
@entity100 celebrates scoring for @entity6 as @entity5 's side defeated @entity19 at the @entity102 @entity103 proud of youngsters yes , @entity106 is putting himself about and snapping through challenges – often running the risk of red – but the £ 10million midfielder was n’t bought as an enforcer - there has been precious little evidence of the silk which made him so easy on the eye as a teenager			1
likewise , though , at @entity6 , where it has been those already in residence at @entity119 ’ who have earned @entity5 his reprieve – @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity100 and @entity128 the men making the difference of late			2
it would , of course , be folly to determine that the recent reversal in fortune will not swing again in the coming weeks			0
@entity15 players look dejected as they fell to a 8 - 0 humiliation at @entity56 earlier this month but @entity13 is the story right now and the @entity57 feels like a cool and shaded place			1
on monday night , at @entity138 , he faces trial by television , just like @entity5 did at @entity141 last month , and that 1 - 0 defeat made for uncomfortable viewing			1
it certainly promises to be a testing time for @entity13 – how he wishes he could wind back the clock .			0

@entity6 have gone unbeaten in october with three wins and a draw
@entity5 has survived calls from @entity6 fans for him to be *sacked*
@entity5 's side beat @entity19 2 - 0 in the @entity20
