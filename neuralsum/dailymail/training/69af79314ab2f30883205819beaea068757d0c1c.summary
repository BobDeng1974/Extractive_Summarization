by @entity1 reporter published : 06:56 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 06:56 est , 18 may 2013 the broadcasting regulator is proposing tighter controls on television subtitles in a bid to stop the screening of inaccurate and often laughable live captions			2
errors appearing at the bottom of the screen have included describing @entity12 leader @entity11 as ' @entity13 ' and calling the head of the @entity15 , ' arch bitch of @entity17 '			2
@entity18 highlighted two funny blunders - singer @entity19 was ' engle @entity20 distinct ' on @entity22 's @entity21 and a @entity24 weather report referred to ' fox patches '			1
subtitled : millions of tv viewers use subtitles like this scene from the @entity24 soap @entity29 , but now @entity18 is demanding tighter controls by broadcasters to avoid inaccuracies mistaken names : @entity11 was described in the live caption as ' @entity13 ' and the @entity15 leader was given the title , @entity39 bitch of @entity17 ' @entity24 bosses were left red - faced again when a reporter visiting a farm spoke of how the pigs ' love to nibble anything that comes into the shed , like our wellies			1
the subtitles alongside the report changed the last word to ' willies ' and the mistake became an internet sensation when a viewer pictured the screen blunder			1
during the @entity58 's funeral , the words ' we 'll now have a moment 's silence for the queen mother ' became " we '' ll now have a moment 's violence for the queen mother '			0
the increase in errors has been partly blamed on the replacement of stenographers by 're - speaking ' , in which a person repeats what is said into a computer with voice recognition software			0
wrong tv subtitles : at her funeral the words , ' there will now be a moment 's silence for the @entity58 became ' there will now be a moment 's violence for the queen mother ' and @entity19 's name was given as ' @entity84 distinct ' most of the errors on the 70 channels that now carry subtitles leave the hard - of - hearing baffled by some of the live captions			1
@entity18 found that 7.6 million people have used subtitles , including 1.4 million with hearing impairments , according to the @entity95			0
earlier research by the regulator found that viewers with hearing problems watched much more television than those without			0
apart from the mistakes , the biggest problems were delays in the appearance of subtitles and freezing of the live captions			0
@entity18 , who consulted @entity109 , the @entity110 of @entity111 and other bodies , have proposed that broadcasters should report back on the quality of their subtitles , every six months			1
they also want the companies to delay live programmes briefly to improve subtitling .			0

one wrong caption described @entity19 as ' engle @entity20 distinct '
@entity24 weather report referred to ' fox patches '
