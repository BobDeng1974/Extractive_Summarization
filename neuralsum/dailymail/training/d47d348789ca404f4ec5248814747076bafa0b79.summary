more than a century since one of the most remarkable scientific objects of antiquity was discovered , experts are hoping to reveal more secrets of the deep using the latest in diving technology			0
@entity7 and @entity8 archaeologists are returning to the ancient shipwreck of @entity10 using the @entity11 - a state - of - the art , deep sea diving suit - that will let them dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions			1
here , the so - called @entity17 , a 2nd - century @entity19 device dubbed the world 's oldest computer , was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 off the remote @entity7 island			1
it was the site of the @entity17 , a 2nd - century @entity19 device dubbed the world 's oldest computer , found in 1900 the highly complex mechanism consisting of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears was used by the ancient @entity7 to track the cycles of the solar system			1
it was so advanced , it took another 1,500 years for an astrological clock of similar sophistication to be made in @entity40			0
the @entity11 , built in @entity41 by @entity42 , lets divers reach depths of 492ft ( 150 metres )			1
it is made of aluminium , with 18 joints in the arms and legs			0
the suit is able to supply oxygen for up to 50 hours , and maintains communication with the surface via an optical cable			2
it also has four 1.6 horsepower thrusters on the back to help the diver move around underwater at relatively high speeds			0
each suit weighs between 35 ( 226kg ) and 42 stone ( 272kg )			0
prices start at around £ 360,000 ( $ 588,000 )			0
now archaeologists returning to the wreck will be able to use the @entity11 to more than double the depth they can dive at , and stay safely at the bottom for longer			1
the @entity11 , built in @entity41 by @entity42 , lets divers reach depths of 492ft ( 150 metres ) , while still performing delicate tasks , said archaeologist @entity71			1
up until now , divers had only been able to operate at a depth of 196ft ( 60 metres )			2
the suit , which makes the wearer resemble @entity77 , ‘ expands our capabilities ’ , continued mr @entity71 , and ‘ i 'll be able to grasp , pluck , clench and dig.			1
. for several hours , ’ he added			2
archaeologists believe many other artefacts are yet to be discovered in and around the wreck			1
the @entity17 was found with a bronze statue of a youth in the wreck of a cargo ship apparently carrying booty to @entity86 , and researchers are certain that other items on board still remain to be discovered			1
‘ we have good signs that there are other objects present , ’ said @entity90 , head of @entity92 's directorate of underwater antiquities , after exploratory dives in the area in 2012 and 2013			1
‘ there are dozens of items left , this was a ship bearing immense riches from @entity106 , ’ added @entity100 , another archaeologist on the team			2
the @entity17 ( pictured ) was recovered from a @entity108 cargo shipwreck off the @entity7 island of @entity10			1
previous studies have shown it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years			1
scans in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses the @entity11 ( pictured ) built in @entity41 by @entity42 , lets divers reach depths of 492ft ( 150 metres )			1
it is made of aluminium , with 18 joints in the arms and legs			0
it also has four 1.6 horsepower thrusters on the back to help the diver move around underwater at relatively high speeds the archaeologists also hope to confirm the presence of a second ship , some 820ft ( 250 metres ) away from the original discovery site			0
@entity10 , which now has a population of only 44 , was on one of antiquity 's busiest trade routes , and a base for @entity141 pirates , some of whom once captured and held the young @entity142 for ransom			0
he later had them all captured and crucified			0
the @entity7 team is assisted by @entity26 , a marine archaeologist from @entity146 at @entity147 , which was involved in a dive to the wreck of the @entity150			2
@entity26 has helped in outings to identify ancient shipwrecks over the last five years			0
@entity10 ( highlighted ) which now has a population of only 44 , was on one of antiquity 's busiest trade routes , and a base for @entity141 pirates , some of whom once captured and held the young @entity142 for ransom			0
he later had them all captured and crucified the @entity17 was recovered in 1900 from the @entity10 wreck - a @entity108 cargo shipwreck off the @entity7 island of @entity10			1
it was discovered in a wooden box measuring 13 inchesx7 inchesx3.5 inches ( 340 × 180 × 90mm ) and consists of bronze dials , gears and cogs			0
a further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 40 hand - cut bronze gears			0
the mechanism is said to have been created in around @entity172 , and is believed to be the world ’s oldest calculator			1
previous studies have shown that it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years			1
more than 80 fragments of the @entity17 have been found , containing a total of 40 hand - cut bronze gears ( pictured ) scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses , and record important events in the @entity7 calendar , such as the @entity189			1
astronomer professor @entity190 of @entity191 said at the time : ' it is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years			2
' the scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors , covered in instructions for its use			2
at the front was a single dial showing the @entity7 zodiac and an @entity206 calendar			0
on the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses			0
the calculator would have been driven by a hand crank			0
the mechanism recorded several important astronomical cycles known to the @entity216 hundreds of years before that help predict eclipses			0
these include the @entity220 - a period of around 18 years separating the return of the moon , @entity223 and sun to the same relative positions			0
the device could track the movements of @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 - the only planets known at the time , the position of the sun , and the location and phases of the moon			2
the researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19 - year calendar on the back of the mechanism			0
the month names are @entity244 - suggest that it may have been built in the @entity244 colonies in north - western @entity92 or @entity247 in @entity248			2
the device was created at a time when the @entity108 had gained control of much of @entity92			1
the @entity17 is on display at the @entity254 in @entity255			0
‘ we may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901 , in the mistaken belief that they were rocks , ’ @entity26 said			2
as well as the new @entity11 , the @entity10 expedition will also use robot mapping equipment and new advanced closed - circuit ‘ rebreathers ’ , which will allow divers much more time underwater			1
‘ we will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site , because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers , ’ the expedition 's website said			1
‘ each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day , and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at @entity10			2

@entity17 was recovered in 1900 from a shipwreck in @entity92
it was created in @entity172 , and is believed to be the world ’s oldest calculator
scans revealed it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years
divers are now using a *revolutionary* suit to further explore the wreckage
the @entity11 lets them more than double the depth they can dive at
it also means they can grasp , clench and dig for ‘ several hours ’ at a time
archaeologists are hoping to find other artefacts in and around the wreck - as well as a second shipwreck
