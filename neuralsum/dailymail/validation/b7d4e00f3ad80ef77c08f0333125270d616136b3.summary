in the @entity2 hall of fame , @entity0 is sandwiched between @entity3 , the inventor of the matchstick , and @entity6 , who envisaged the first passenger steam train			1
there can be no doubt which hometown boy is delivering the most high - octane thrills these days , but even the most fanciful residents in the @entity14 market town could not have predicted the success @entity0 now enjoys back in 2013			1
after missing out on the @entity16 with a torn hamstring he had no coach , no lottery funding , had quit athletics and was about to join the @entity21			1
@entity0 ( second left ) was close to quitting athletics after missing out on the @entity16 in 2012 he had a torn hamstring , no coach , no lottery funding and was planning to join the army the @entity27 took 60m gold for @entity29 at the @entity30 in @entity31 @entity0 was not a stranger to hard times			1
as a 13 - year - old , for seven months he shared one room in a homeless hostel with his parents and four siblings after the family ran into financial difficulties			0
citing his ‘ mental strength ’ , he decided to give athletics one last roll of the dice			2
it paid off with a 60m gold medal at the @entity47 in @entity48 last year , where he surprised everyone - including the bookmakers who had him at 33 - 1 - by beating @entity53 @entity52 in the final			1
boosted by his extra income , @entity0 has rejoined the @entity57 training group of which he was a part in the run - up to @entity16			2
asked after his golden 6.51sec season ’s - best run on sunday what @entity62 had brought to the party , @entity0 did a double gun salute			2
after his victory @entity0 gave the event mascot , a mole called @entity69 , a relieved hug @entity2 high - achievers ( from left ) : @entity3 , the inventor of the matchstick , and @entity6 , the man who envisaged the first passenger steam train @entity0 ( third right ) clocked 6.51 seconds in a commanding win and is now targeting 100m outdoor glory ‘ i ’m stronger			1
i ’ve got a bit more bicep there , ’ he said , ‘ we did n’t necessarily train for the indoors but if you saw the semi-final i dropped my arms and could have run about 6.45sec			0
’ he doubts whether even the @entity89 and @entity53 , including @entity90 , could beat him over the distance			2
‘ @entity92 beat me a couple of times but a lot of people beat me early season			0
in a championship i think it would be very difficult			0
’ he has now set his sights on breaking that hallowed 100m 10 - second barrier outdoors			0
‘ some people think i ’m a spring runner but you ’ve only seen me on the scene for 12 months now			0
‘ if you watched the race today and saw the way i ran away from the field you can see what is going to happen outdoors			0
