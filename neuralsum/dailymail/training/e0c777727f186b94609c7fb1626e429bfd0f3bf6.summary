for 88 minutes on sunday evening , there may have been something uncomfortably familiar about this @entity3 performance for the watching @entity5 supporters			1
shorn of ideas and deprived of pace , @entity7 ’s team increasingly resorted to high and speculative balls forward			0
whisper it quietly , but this rather felt as though we were watching the @entity5 of the @entity15 incarnation all over again			1
the similarities even extended to @entity17 , @entity18 ’s most trusted on - field lieutenant , failing to show			2
on this occasion , though , one imagines that the @entity20 did not have a statement prepared for the post-match mixed zone alleging that his team - mates are ‘ often playing in my zones ’ , as he did after @entity5 ’s dreadful 2 - 0 defeat by @entity26			1
under @entity18 , he simply would not dare			2
the midfield bulldog @entity40 had succumbed to injury			0
captain @entity42 had been hooked with fifteen minutes to go			1
for all intents and purposes , this @entity3 team looked finished			2
over 4,000 miles away at @entity47 , they may have been dusting down the black leather chair in the manager ’s office to prepare for @entity18 ’s arrival			2
and then it happened , inexplicably and unpredictably			0
maybe we should have known better			0
after all , @entity3 have won three of their four games in this @entity57 having trailed at some point in the game			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and now @entity31 have all fallen under an illusion of comfort , only to be brutally struck down			0
in @entity65 , a wry smile may have curled on to the faces of those who make the weekly pilgrimage to @entity69			0
they have seen teams with this kind of spirit before			0
@entity3 ’s mettle was impressive , their refusal to go quietly from this magnificent @entity57 admirable			1
fergie - time may have competition			0
throw in an injury - time penalty strewn with controversy and there ’s a peculiar sense of deja - vu			2
feeling down : @entity15 looks dejected on the sidelines as he sees @entity5 lose again making a difference : @entity18 gives instructions as @entity3 came from behind to win famous pose : @entity5 were known for stunning late comebacks in sir @entity90 's time at the club @entity7 ’s similarities with sir @entity90 would appear to go beyond an authoritative discipline and an aversion to speaking openly with the press			1
the best managers inspire incomparable loyalty , the kind that sees substitutes such as @entity101 - @entity100 , who had not played a single minute so far at this @entity57 , emerge from the bench to win the football match almost single - handedly , creating one for @entity104 and then scoring the winning strike from the penalty spot			1
in @entity108 parlance , they know it as doing a ‘ @entity113 ’ , remembering the forward ’s contribution on that evening in the @entity112 in 1999			0
bold move : @entity18 took off @entity42 and the move worked as @entity3 came back to win they will recognise , also , the courage to make the unpopular decision			1
how would @entity42 have reacted to his manager if @entity3 failed to win following his substitution ? what would be the repercussions as @entity18 begins his @entity5 career ? frankly , @entity18 showed little regard			1
his mind was made up			0
egos will not be indulged when the success of the team is at stake			0
if only @entity130 had displayed such courage in his convictions			0
one gloomy saturday afternoon in december immediately sprang to mind on sunday evening , when @entity5 were defeated 1 - 0 by @entity134			2
@entity42 was evidently off - the - pace , his performance justifying a change			2
@entity15 feared the consequences , stating : ‘ i think if i ’d brought him off some people would say ‘ what are you doing ? you are 1 - 0 down and you ’re taking off your top goalscorer			0
’ not going to plan : @entity42 did not have a great game and was taken off in the second half off the pace : @entity42 had a bad game when @entity5 lost to @entity134 back in december the @entity148 never could discover the key to that magic box of comebacks at @entity69 , his players disaffected and uncommitted as the clock ticked down on his traumatic reign			1
the @entity155 he inherited became timid lambs , trading in domestic domination for a startling neurosis			0
after sir @entity90 ’s 27 years in the managerial chair , we assumed that @entity5 players were on auto - pilot , that those qualities of utter determination , self - sacrifice and loyalty to the shirt were self - perpetuating			1
for nine months , it all dissipated			0
@entity169 well that ends well : @entity42 applauds the fans at the end after @entity3 progressed under @entity15 , @entity5 recovered to win after falling behind on just four occasions out of twenty			1
the season before , @entity5 had reversed deficits to win eleven times before @entity175 alone			1
@entity5 supporters may have felt those breathless moments were now confined to the dvd ’s of the glorious yesteryears			0
@entity18 ’s stirring crescendo on the grandest stage will assure the rank - and - file that there will be many more of those epic times to come .			1

@entity3 win in @entity90 time with a controversial penalty
@entity20 come from behind three times in four games at the @entity57 to win
@entity5 came from behind to win on just four of twenty occasions under @entity15
@entity18 hooks captain @entity42 while @entity15 always *remained* fearful
