by @entity0 last updated at 12:28 pm on 27th january 2012 it was supposed to be his @entity3 moment - a speech to 20,000 adoring supporters which would seal his deal with the @entity9 electorate			1
but the left - wing frontrunner in the presidential race has been left a laughing stock , after his high - brow attempt to quote @entity14 spectacularly backfired			1
@entity15 thought he was citing a little - known passage of @entity14 when , lapping up the applause , he said : ' and i will quote @entity14 , who recalls this universal law , they failed because they did not start with a dream			1
' but he was in fact quoting current @entity25 author @entity24 - from his 1989 fictional novel @entity28 of @entity27 about a @entity30 terrorist			1
faux pas : @entity15 ( left ) lapped up the applause wowing 20,000 with what he thought was a high - brow quote from @entity14 ( right ) red - faced @entity15 may be left wing , but has now been mocked for taking his ideology a step too far by invoking the book 's hero , @entity38			1
a @entity41 revolutionary , he ends up a terrorist for the murderous @entity44 guerrilla group , @entity43			2
the group 's motto was ' @entity47 â€“ @entity48 will open the shining path to revolution '			2
@entity24 , 54 , who is a direct descendant of @entity14 's grandfather , said : ' i could n't believe my eyes when i saw the @entity9 presidential candidate had quoted me			1
' but he added : ' i was really pleased to see how the quote remains fresh			2
' it can apply to anything and i think it 's rather good it 's applying to a presidential campaign			2
you do n't need to be @entity30 to want a better society			0
' mistake : in fact , @entity15 was quoting current @entity25 author @entity24 ( left ) from his novel @entity28 of @entity27 ( right ) of his character 's quote , he told the @entity68 : ' he is saying the last @entity30 revolution of the @entity70 had failed			1
' but his is going to succeed and the idea is that they failed because they did not have a dream			0
' the book has been translated into more than 10 languages , and won critical acclaim when it was released in @entity9 in 1991 with the publisher @entity78			0
president : @entity80 is lagging in the polls @entity15 has been ridiculed for his faux pas in @entity83 outside @entity84 on sunday			1
the right - wing @entity86 camp , which is backing the embattled @entity80 , is expected to seize on it as a sign he is not the ' reconstructed ' left - winged as he likes to be portrayed			0
the rest of the rally , where he said he would raise taxes on banks , big firms and the rich to wipe out the public deficit , has been hailed a success by the left			0
he also said he would pump more funds into education and state - aided job creation if he wins power in may			0
@entity15 , tipped in polls to unseat @entity80 and become @entity9 's first @entity103 president in 17 years , promised to spend 20 billion euros on hiring 60,000 extra schooling staff and police , to help start - ups and small companies and create 150,000 state - aided jobs			1
he also vowed to lean hardest on the country 's wealthiest as well as its biggest companies and the banking industry to drum up the lion 's share of another 29 billion euros needed to cut the national deficit to zero by the end of 2017			0
the 57 - year - old said : ' the vast majority of the @entity9 people will not be called on to make additional sacrifices			0
' if there are sacrifices to be made , and there will be , then it will be for the wealthiest to make them			0
' he pledged to reduce @entity9 's large deficit to zero by the end of 2017 , a year later than @entity80 's conservative government , with 17 of the 29 billion euros needed coming from company tax and the rest from households , primarily the richest ones .			0
