@entity2 ’s @entity1 hopes have been dealt a huge blow after @entity6 international centre @entity4 was ruled out until at least the end of the season			1
the 25 - times - capped centre is now also a doubt for september ’s @entity11 after undergoing an operation on his left shoulder for the second time in a year			1
he had played a major role in @entity2 ’s run to the @entity1 semi-final where they play @entity20 at @entity21 on friday			2
@entity4 has n’t played since picking up his latest injury on @entity6 duty against @entity24 in the final game of the @entity26 last month			1
with @entity30 ’s @entity29 also a major fitness doubt for the @entity11 , @entity4 ’s injury could leave @entity6 coach @entity31 with a big gap to fill at centre			1
@entity34 of @entity30 will be first choice for outside - centre but it could be a fight between @entity38 of @entity39 and @entity40 of @entity41 , who missed the @entity26 through injury , for the inside - centre jersey			2
@entity6 player @entity4 in action during the @entity26 match between against @entity24 at @entity21 the @entity2 medical staff had hoped that @entity4 ’s shoulder would heal naturally but have decided further surgery is required as there has been no improvement over the last three weeks			1
a club spokeswoman said : ‘ it had been hoped that @entity4 would be able to manage his injury but , following consultation with specialists at @entity56 , the decision to perform an investigative arthroscopy was taken			1
‘ this resulted in him requiring a further surgical procedure to help deal with his shoulder complaints			2
‘ @entity4 will continue his rehabilitation programme with the @entity2 medical team and wo n’t play again this season			2
’ @entity4 was putting a brave face on having his season cut short by this latest injury blow			1
in a tweet , the @entity6 and @entity2 centre said : ‘ gutted that my season is over already after getting surgery			1
‘ brings an end to a frustrating year for me but positive about next few months			2
’ @entity2 are short of cover in the centre positions and will now rely on new zealander @entity76 and @entity78 @entity77 — who both started in the quarter - final away win over @entity81 in the absence of @entity4 — from now until the end of the season			1
@entity4 went under the knife last week but he has now been told he will have to be operated on again kiwi @entity86 is the only other experienced centre at the club			1
to add to their woes , @entity2 also have a major doubt over @entity93 , who was forced off with a head knock in the 34 - 3 @entity96 loss to @entity97 on saturday			0
@entity93 is following return - to - play protocols and a late decision on the back - row forward ’s fitness will be taken			0
without @entity4 and possibly @entity102 , @entity2 will be less confident of overcoming the @entity20 on friday and reaching the @entity103 , where they would play @entity105 or @entity106			2
like @entity2 , the @entity20 may be in the lower half of the table , but they are in a rich vein of form and have won three matches in a row			0
their latest and biggest scalp was taken last weekend when they overcame @entity114 25 - 22 in the @entity96			0
@entity115 is desperate to defeat the @entity116 and keep alive his dream of being part of the first @entity120 professional club side to lift silverware			0
the @entity6 international has managed just 14 games for club and country in the past year @entity126 is one of seven survivors from the @entity2 team that lost 22 - 19 in the @entity131 semi-final against @entity132 three years ago			1
but the hooker insists reaching the @entity134 at @entity135 on may 1 would overtake even that 2012 highlight			0
‘ i have been at @entity2 through many ups and downs , so to win the @entity103 would be my biggest achievement , ’ said 85 - times - capped @entity126			0
‘ it would also be a massive boost and something the club could take confidence from and build on in future seasons			0
it would n’t just be good for us , but also for @entity120 rugby			0
‘ we did n’t have a good @entity26 in terms of results and it would be a great boost to the game in @entity6 if we manage to get to the final and win it			2
’ @entity115 insists @entity2 have already forgotten that embarrassing home defeat to @entity97 and believes confidence remains high ahead of friday ’s match			0
‘ this is a @entity1 semi-final and we will all be up for it , ’ said the 30 - year - old former @entity6 captain			1
‘ we were n’t at our best against @entity97 but we will be fixing what went wrong in training this week			0
‘ what we have in our favour is home advantage and we can expect a big crowd who will give is us a lot of backing			0
‘ i have detected an excitement among our fans about the @entity174 game and our whole @entity103 campaign			0
