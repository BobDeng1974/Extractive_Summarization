@entity18 of @entity19 said the arena crowds the station ' like three fat men in a rowboat			0
' futuristic visions : four teams of architects have presented plans for a reimagined @entity5 , this is @entity28 's proposed design			1
lots of light : this is @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity35 's proposed design for @entity5 , which would let in more light than the current design historic station : train tracks run under the @entity42 building , center , before reaching @entity5 , which sits under the familiar circular @entity15 , center back new look : the new designs aim to revamp and brighten the aging train station @entity48 of @entity28 called @entity5 ' a disaster ' and said his firm has imagined ' a magnificent future ' for the area with @entity15 moved just to the southwest of its current location			1
@entity15 called the plans ' pie - in - the - sky drawings			2
' ' it 's curious to see that there are so many ideas on how to tear down a privately owned building that is a thriving @entity7 icon , supports thousands of jobs and is currently completing a $ 1 billion transformation , ' the company said in a statement			2
the design challenge was prompted by an upcoming vote by @entity7 's @entity69 on renewing @entity15 's permit to operate on top of @entity5			1
the proposal by @entity28 ( @entity28 ) incorporates glass walls and skylights so that even ' from the tracks you know where you are			0
' another alternative : @entity28 aims to move @entity80 to a spot just south of the @entity82 , on @entity83 between 30th and 31st streets @entity15 wants the permit renewed in perpetuity , while the city @entity88 is recommending a 15 - year limit			2
the @entity13 and some other civic groups want the permit renewed for 10 years			0
in addition to @entity95 and @entity96 , @entity97 & @entity98 , architects of the under - construction 1 @entity100 , the firms that presented new @entity5 designs were @entity102 , which has worked on the @entity103 and renovating @entity104 , and @entity105 , one of the firms that designed the @entity109 arena in @entity110			2
they offered plans for an airy , light - filled @entity5 with shops , rooftop gardens and other amenities			0
@entity19 would upzone plots all along @entity117 to make way for tall office towers , four of which would occupy the four corners of the @entity5 site a three - acre roof garden would sit on top of the station , while all of the train lines would use the multi-layered structure whose centerpiece would be an airy 120 - foot - high main hall with skylights the @entity19 plan would connect @entity80 to the rest of the city via an elevated walkway for pedestrians and cyclists called the water line @entity19 would upzone plots all along @entity117 to make way for tall office towers , four of which would occupy the four corners of the @entity5 site new home for @entity80 : @entity19 's plan involves relocating @entity15 to a built - out pier along the @entity144 to the west of the @entity146 @entity102 of @entity102 called her firm 's ' city within a city ' design ' a large sponge - like mass aerated in many directions			1
' some plans envisioned paying for the upgrades by replacing existing buildings in the @entity5 complex with new mixed - use skyscrapers			0
@entity15 , home to the @entity160 , the @entity161 and the @entity163 's @entity162 as well as a venue for concerts and other events , would be moved due west to a pier on the @entity144 under the @entity170 plan			0

new home : @entity15 would be moved a few blocks to the south and west in the @entity175 mail processing facility in the @entity105 plan @entity180 changes : the four firms that took part in a design challenge all said the only way to improve @entity5 would be to move @entity15 from its current home atop the train station relocations : ' @entity5 can not move and the @entity15 can , ' @entity105 's @entity188 said in a phone interview			1
' right now everything 's piled on top of everything ' funding : some plans envisioned paying for the upgrades by replacing existing buildings in the @entity5 complex with new mixed - use skyscrapers ' @entity5 can not move and the @entity15 can , ' @entity105 's @entity188 said in a phone interview			1
' right now everything 's piled on top of everything			0
' @entity102 's plan puts the @entity15 in the back part of the @entity204 building directly west of @entity5			1
@entity15 said an earlier plan to move the arena to that spot ' collapsed for a number of reasons that did not involve @entity80 , but did involve many of the same people now pressuring @entity80 to move , including the @entity13 , which created enormous obstacles to achieving the relocation			2
' city within a city : @entity102 took a more philosophical approach , making much of the idea that a new @entity5 could be ' a city within a city ' @entity102 envisions @entity5 as ' a large sponge - like mass , aerated from every angle ' with @entity80 moved to behind the @entity204 building on @entity223 , there 's room for a variety of spaces , from a spa to a micro theater to a cascading park inside the station , @entity102 envision drifting food vendors carrying their wares around their waist like at a baseball stadium also imagined are train arrival and departure times that would be projected onto the floor and real - time video footage of trains approaching and leaving the station aired onto a large screen its statement concluded , ' the fact that this exercise does not include anyone who actually has detailed knowledge of this issue or understands the realities of this complex project exposes this exercise for exactly what it is			1
' the architects said they would hope to work with the owners of the arena to the benefit of all parties			0
' @entity15 should not take this study as an affront , ' @entity102 of @entity102 said in interview			0
