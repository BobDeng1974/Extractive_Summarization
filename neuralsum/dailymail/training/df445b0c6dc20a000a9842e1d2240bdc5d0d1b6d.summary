by @entity0 the @entity1 on thursday took the unprecedented step of releasing the names of the 55 colleges and universities currently facing a @entity7 investigation over their handling of sexual abuse complaints			1
the release came two days after a @entity12 task force promised greater government transparency on sexual assault in higher education			1
going forward , the department said , it will keep an updated list of schools facing such an investigation and make it available upon request			2
the schools range from big public universities like @entity25 , the @entity26 in @entity27 and @entity28 to private schools like @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 in the @entity35			1
@entity37 schools like @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 are also on the list			2
scroll down for the entire list of schools being investigated @entity38 is one of the @entity37 schools named on a list of colleges facing a federal sexual assault probe the agency previously would confirm such an investigation when asked , but students and others were often unaware of them			1
' we hope this increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue , ' @entity53 , the department 's assistant secretary for civil rights , said in a statement			2
@entity53 said a school 's appearance on the list does not mean that it has violated the law but that an investigation is ongoing			0
@entity7 prohibits gender discrimination at schools that receive federal funds			0
it is the same law that guarantees girls equal access to sports , but it also regulates institutions ' handling of sexual violence and increasingly is being used by victims who say their schools failed to protect them			2
@entity78 , general counsel for the @entity79 , a higher education group , said most of the schools were probably aware there was such an investigation			1
' i think that every college and university in the current environment is concerned about the need to be very attentive to what they are doing with regard to policies and procedures ' related to sexual assault on campuses , @entity78 said			1
@entity28 @entity96 @entity95 @entity97 @entity98 @entity99 @entity100 @entity101 @entity101 at @entity102 @entity103 @entity104 @entity34 @entity105 @entity106 @entity107 at @entity108 @entity109 @entity30 @entity110 @entity112 - @entity111 @entity113 @entity114 @entity115 @entity116 @entity117 @entity38 - @entity118 @entity119 - @entity114 @entity120 @entity121 @entity26 - @entity27 @entity122 @entity123 at @entity124 @entity125 @entity40 @entity39 @entity126 @entity127 and @entity128 @entity129 @entity130 at @entity131 @entity132 @entity25 @entity133 @entity134 @entity135 @entity136 @entity137 @entity32 @entity138 @entity139 @entity140 the @entity142 pan-american college of @entity144 @entity145 @entity146 @entity147 @entity148 @entity149 citing research , the @entity12 has said that 1 in 5 female students is assaulted			1
president @entity152 appointed a task force comprised of his @entity155 members to review the issue after hearing complaints about the poor treatment of campus rape victims and the hidden nature of such crimes			0
the task force announced the creation of a website , notalone.gov , offering resources for victims and information about past enforcement actions on campuses			0
the task force also made a wide range of recommendations to schools , such as identifying confidential victims ' advocates and conducting surveys to better gauge the frequency of sexual assault on their campuses			1
the department publicized guidance on @entity7 's sexual assault provisions in 2011 , and complaints by students have since increased			2
complaints , however , do n't always lead to an investigation			0
the department can withhold federal funding from a school that does n't comply with the law , but it so far has not used that power and instead has negotiated voluntary resolutions for violators			0
sens. @entity196 , @entity197 , and @entity198 , @entity199 , have said non-compliance under the law is ' far too common '			0
they say a lack of federal resources is partly to blame for that , and they 've sought more money to ensure timely and proper investigations			0
another law that campus sexual assault cases fall under is the @entity209 , which requires colleges and universities to report crime statistics on or near their campuses			1
it also requires schools to develop prevention policies and ensure victims their basic rights			0
investigations under this law are not included in the list that was released .			0

big public universities like @entity25 , the @entity26 in @entity27 and @entity28 also being investigated
private schools like @entity30 in @entity31 and @entity34 in the @entity35 face probe
