@entity1 , as agents do , backs his client			0
forget @entity4 , he tells us , @entity3 can walk into any team			1
not on recent evidence he ca n't			0
both @entity3 and @entity8 failed to impress in @entity4 's clash with @entity10 the @entity12 forward ( left ) was eventually substituted for @entity13 , who was more effective against 19th - placed @entity10 the @entity12 combined with @entity8 in the most one - paced attack since the @entity16 cricket team last toured @entity17			1
for weeks @entity4 fans had bemoaned @entity20 's decision to play untested youngster @entity13 ahead of the man they paid £ 6million for just to get on loan			1
now we know that there was method in the apparent madness			0
@entity10 's centre - half partnership of @entity29 and @entity30 are not among the @entity31 's finest or fastest			1
for long periods , however , they were untroubled by a strikeforce worth a reported £ 70m			0
their team appeared to be wearing kits made of @entity38 and throughout the first half @entity3 did his best @entity41 impression with the ball cannoning off him on more than one occasion			2
@entity3 has only scored four goals in 18 appearances for @entity4 since joining on loan @entity4 captain @entity47 offers a word of advice to @entity3 during the @entity10 match it was ugly to see			1
yes , his flick back set up @entity53 to save @entity4 from half - time pelters from their own fans			1
but the man is here to score goals and he is not doing that			0
the record says it all : 13 starts , five substitute appearances and four goals			2
perhaps it is still too early to judge			0
this is , remember , a man who has come back from serious injury before			0
but it would appear that the anterior cruciate ligament damage he sustained in january last year may have done more than keep him out of the @entity72			0
when @entity3 was mercy substituted on 74 minutes against @entity10 he received applause you would describe as polite rather than rapturous from the home support			1
@entity13 impressed against an , admittedly tired , @entity10 defence when he came on as a substitute @entity3 has been preferred up front to @entity47 , who spent parts of the game playing as a holding midfielder the contingent of travelling @entity84 were not so kind , gleefully belting out ' what a waste of money '			1
on came @entity13 who , along with @entity87 , immediately had an admittedly tiring defence back - pedalling			2
the youngster may not have @entity3 's pedigree but as @entity92 has already said , whether a player costs £ 95m or £ 5,000 it makes no difference to him			2
@entity1 now appears to have gone nuclear , stating that @entity3 would not be struggling if sir @entity95 had been in charge			2
that sounds very much like a comment from a man who has just asked @entity4 about the chances of them taking up that £ 43.5m option to make his deal a permanent one .			0

@entity3 has scored four goals in 18 appearances this *season*
his *performances* for @entity4 have not been good enough
@entity13 has looked more effective when playing up front for them
@entity3 struggled again in @entity4 's 3 - 1 win against @entity10
