dolphins are known for their intelligence , but it appears this one has even learned how to dance - creating its own hula hoop with the waves of the sea			1
amateur photographer @entity8 was watching a pod of bottlenose dolphins off the coast of southern @entity12 when he spotted a lone dolphin appearing to dance in the waves			1
mr @entity8 , who was volunteering on a whale - watching boat when he spotted the pod , took a series of pictures of the dancing dolphin			2
