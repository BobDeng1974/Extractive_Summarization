it is hard to imagine the mortification @entity2 felt after he used the word ' coloured ' instead of ' black ' when trying to make a point about the lack of roles available for ethnic minorities in the @entity9			0
his regret will no doubt have been intensified by the fact , just less than two years ago , the painful matter of how his family made its fortune came under scrutiny when he starred in 12 years a slave			1
@entity2 's ancestors were slave owners , boasting ' 250 negroes ' on their sugar plantation in @entity21 in the 18th and 19th centuries , and were given - on the abolition of the slave trade in the 1830s - £ 6,000 to compensate for the loss of their ' human property '			1
in today 's money , the compensation would be the equivalent of more than £ 3.6m			1
now , @entity30 can show pictures of inside the plantation where hundreds of men and women toiled as slaves while his ancestors reaped the rewards			1
his mother , the actress @entity65 , had urged him not to use his real surname professionally , in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves			0
but @entity2 , 38 , has always been open about his history and , if anything , appears to have sought out roles which allow him no room to hide			0
the oscar - nominee , who is up for the best actor gong on february 22 , first spoke of it when he appeared in the abolition film @entity55 in 2006			2
at the time , he half - joked he took the role of @entity82 ' as a sort of apology ' for his ancestry			0
but it would be his role in the @entity88 - winning 12 years a slave which would truly thrust the @entity2 history into the spotlight			2
art imitating life : @entity2 played @entity94 in the 2013 film , a plantation owner who was the first man to buy @entity97 , played by @entity98 property : the people enslaved on the sugar plantation were seen as nothing more than property by @entity2 's ancestors : they were included in the overall value of the property , alongside the land , in the family 's accounts comfortable : the @entity2 family were able to build up their wealth by using slaves to work on the sugar plantation - using it to create a comfortable lifestyle in the @entity117 country			1
pictured is the sitting room at @entity42 the film , based on the memoir of @entity97 , a 19th century black musician who was kidnapped and sold into the slave trade , saw @entity2 playing @entity94 , the man who ' owned ' @entity123 first			0
it was a role which , surely , was n't that far removed from his own ancestors , who moved to @entity21 in the late 17th century			2
the move was the idea of his eighth - great - grandfather , @entity128 , who brought his wife @entity129 and three children half way across the world for a new life			0
but @entity128 died shortly after arrival and would never see the plantations his descendants would go onto own after his son @entity137 built up the family fortune			0
modern day : @entity2 with his parents @entity65 ( left ) and @entity140 ( right , with actress @entity141 in 2012 ) , who are both professional actors who even appeared alongside him in @entity143			0
his mother @entity144 warned him not to use his surname , for fear of reprisals fro the descendants of slaves will : @entity137 had built up a significant fortune , but had no sons - so he left the plantation to his grandson , on the understanding he would change his surname to @entity2 , while also stipulating it would also ' be kept staffed with 250 negro slaves ' and 150 cattle diversifying : @entity2 did not just own the farms however , he also built refineries , which helped to add ot his fortune			1
pictured is an old map of the plantation rebellion : the family - whose members are thought to be buried at @entity167 's @entity166 , in @entity21 - left the country in 1820 , four years after the slaves revolted in 1816 , led by a man called @entity171 - who worked on their plantation compensation : when the slave trade came to an end in 1838 , @entity174 , @entity2 's great - great - great grandfather was given £ 6,000 for the loss of his human property			1
pictured above is a worker on the plantation today empire : @entity2 's direct ancestors were not the only members of the family to own property on the island			1
the nearby @entity49 plantation was also own by the @entity2 family @entity137 learned the basics of the sugar industry as a salaried plantation foreman , before buying up plantations in the early 18th century and building refineries to turn raw cane into sugar			2
the family lived in comfort , in the white walled house with shuttered windows and large rooms where they could shelter from the heat			0
by the time he died in 1750 , @entity137 had built up a small fortune			0
but he had no son to inherit			0
his will showed his priorities : he left his estate to his grandson @entity137 ( his daughter 's son ) on the condition he changed his surname to @entity2 and stipulated that his plantation ' be kept staffed with 250 negro slaves and 150 head of cattle '			1
pastor : @entity2 's character in 12 years a slave was a pastor - yet did not disagree with owning other human beings faith : the inside of the church where @entity2 's family once worshiped in @entity21 working : the plantation is still going today , although underneath the ownership of a new family portrait : yet more than 150 years after the @entity2 family left the plantation , a painting of @entity46 still stands in the hallway modern : the plantation was bought by 66 - year - old @entity234 in 1985 , and has been updated for modern living workers rights : today , the people who work on the plantation are all paid a fair wage for a day 's work owner : @entity234 stands on the steps where @entity2 's ancestors once watched over their land history : a picture of @entity234 , left , as a young boy with his family the plantations passed down the generations until 1816 , when @entity137 's grandson , @entity174 , faced a rebellion from one of his slaves			1
the uprising lasted two months until @entity171 and an estimated 1,000 slaves were killed – another 214 slaves were executed and 123 shipped off the island			2
but the writing was on the wall			0
in 1820 @entity174 returned to @entity9 to live at @entity261 , a stately home , in @entity263 , which is now the site of @entity264 , and 18 years later the slave trade in @entity21 was abolished – @entity2 great - great - great grandfather received more than £ 6,000 for the loss of their ' human ' property .			1

@entity272 star has *previously* revealed his shame at family history
oscar nominee 's ancestors kept up to 250 slaves on @entity21 plantation
slave uprising in 1816 was started by one of the men on their land
@entity286 left the island in 1820 , 18 years before the abolition of slavery
@entity291 paid £ 6,000 in ' compensation ' when it was finally *outlawed*
