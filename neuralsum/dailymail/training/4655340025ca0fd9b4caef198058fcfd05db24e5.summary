@entity1 came under fire from conservationists for making decisions ‘ on the back of a fag packet ’ after he declared that the amount of land under development in the @entity18 may have to increase by a third to tackle the housing shortage			1
they branded the former think tank boss an ‘ intellectual gadfly ’ and urged him to ‘ get serious ’ , adding new building should focus on so - called brownfield sites that have previously been developed			1
mr @entity1 told @entity27 ’s @entity26 programme that ministers would protect the @entity29 – but warned that large areas of ‘ open land ’ may have to be given over for housing			1
while @entity33 , chief executive of the @entity34 , acknowledged that more housing was needed , he warned against allowing developers free rein			0
he also pointed out official figures suggest 12 per cent of @entity39 is already built on			0
mr @entity33 said : ‘ rather than giving up on good planning and allowing housebuilders to let rip , we should be re-using the tens of thousands of hectares of brownfield land available for high quality affordable housing			0
‘ when he was running a think tank , @entity1 specialised in interesting if somewhat unrealistic ideas			2
he is no longer an intellectual gadfly – he is a minister with a serious job			1
’ @entity50 of the @entity51 said : ‘ i think these figures sound very much like “ back of the fag packet ” calculations to me			0
mr @entity1 told @entity27 's @entity26 programme that ministers would protect the @entity29 - but warned that large areas of ' open land ' may have to be given over for housing ‘ three per cent of the country is an area about the size of @entity62 and we do n’t think that you need to build on greenfield land to quite this extent			1
we need to integrate properly new development into the landscape			0
‘ making an announcement like this about opening up a third of extra land for development sort of opens the floodgates to development that is n’t planned in that way			0
’ @entity77 , chief executive of the @entity78 , described mr @entity1 ’s intervention as ‘ extremely disconcerting ’			2
she said house building on the scale he outlined would fuel massive demand for quarrying and result in ‘ further fragmentation of irreplaceable habitats ’			0
however mr @entity1 ’s intervention was welcomed by business			2
@entity87 , of the @entity88 , said : ‘ @entity1 is absolutely right – we need more housing , and the only way to get it is to build it			2
’ speaking to the @entity27 , mr @entity1 also hit out at developers for building ‘ pig ugly ’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting new development			1
mr @entity1 will step up his campaign today with a speech to planners in which he will vow to take on @entity102 and local authorities who try to block new housing .			0
