by @entity0 for @entity1 a father who did n’t have a clue what to do after the birth of his first child has given up his job to create the first app specifically designed to help out hapless new dads			1
@entity10 , 32 , had his first child , a girl named @entity12 , with wife @entity13 just over two years ago			1
but as soon as he brought his baby home , @entity10 felt completely lost and certainly not properly briefed on what to do			1
@entity10 gave up his job after the birth to create the app for fathers @entity10 , pictured with second child @entity18 , felt completely lost when he took his first child @entity12 home , as if he had not been properly briefed on what to do @entity10 quit his job as in advertising when his second child @entity18 was born and has spent the last eight months working on the app , which is already proving to be a great success			1
users can share tips and tricks that help them with their babies , and dedicated @entity10 has even set up a photography studio in his home to take pictures of the dads in action			1
@entity10 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ' if i ’m honest , i was absolutely terrified			1
' when your baby is born , you suddenly feel a huge weight of responsibility and quickly realise that this tiny bundle of life is completely dependent on you			0
' the thing about pregnancy is that , from a male perspective at least , the fun bit happens at the start			0
users can share tips and tricks that help them with their babies , and dedicated @entity10 has even set up a photography studio in his home to take pictures of the dads in action ' then you get the boring bit , where nothing much happens			1
' and then you get moaned at and have to be supportive and do the odd back rub or foot massage			0
' when the contractions started @entity13 turned to me and said , ‘ shall we go to hospital ? ’ ' in my head i am thinking , ‘ i do n’t know ! ’ then you go through labour and i think we all know it is pretty bad			0
' i was really shell shocked from a bloke ’s point of view at how long it took and how much pain she was in , and how little i could do about it			0
' then we got the baby and we did n’t have a clue what to do with it			0
parenting groups talk about labour but there is n’t much about what happens afterwards			0
' within the first three weeks of it being on the @entity88 , the £ 1.50 app was downloaded more than a thousand times by floundering fathers he added : ' about a week after birth , i went for a quick pint with some other dads i ’d met through our local parenting group			1
' it soon became apparent that we all felt we wanted a quick database of practical information , ideally with loads of pictures to show us what to do			2
' we wanted to take good care of our partner and baby , we just did n’t know how			0
' that ’s how i came upon the idea of @entity110			2
' eight months ago , @entity13 gave birth to their second child , a boy named @entity18			2
within the first three weeks of it being on the @entity88 , the £ 1.50 app was downloaded more than a thousand times , and @entity10 is now averaging in excess of 50 sales a day , as well as dozens of new tip submissions			1
he said : ' the app is full of all the stuff that baby books never tell you			2
' like , for example , it ’s completely normal for baby boys to get erections and for baby girls to have mini-periods after birth			0
' it ’s embarrassing to talk about , but these experiences are common and can leave us dads utterly bewildered			2
' @entity110 is available to download from the @entity136 for £ 1.50 .			0
