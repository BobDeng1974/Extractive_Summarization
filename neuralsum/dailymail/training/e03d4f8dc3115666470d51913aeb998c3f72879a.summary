@entity35 , a @entity35 sergeant who served in uniform in @entity96 and @entity7 before working for @entity12 , told @entity58 : ' it was going against everything that we were trying to do over there			1
it was like a frat house for adults			0

whistle blower : @entity35 , a @entity35 sergeant who served in uniform in @entity96 and @entity7 before working for @entity12 , quit after only three months accuser : @entity35 said he quit because of the way he was treated by their colleagues , who would bully them for not joining in the party , out of sheer disgust , and out of concern that their own safety was being compromised by the behavior the company 's senior on - site executive @entity178 was often the ringleader behind the parties and would try to pressure others into taking part , the suit alleges			1
