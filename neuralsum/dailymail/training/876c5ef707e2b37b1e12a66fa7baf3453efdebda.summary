the real bomber ? @entity1 has been named as a likely suspect in the @entity4 bombing for 25 years , the @entity4 has been shrouded in mystery			1
now , an @entity7 terrorist has been revealed as a likely suspect in the devastating attack			2
@entity1 - who is serving life in prison for a series of bombings - has been named in a private investigation called @entity15			1
he is alleged to be behind the blast that took place on board @entity4 over @entity19 in 1988 - killing 270 people			1
the investigation - put forward as a report by @entity23 in @entity24 - has also accused the @entity25 of covering up @entity1 's role in the atrocity , according the @entity28 and @entity29			1
it was commissioned by lawyers for @entity33 @entity32 , who was jailed in 2001 for masterminding the bombing			2
if the report is correct , it means @entity32 - who died of cancer aged 60 last year after being controversially freed from jail in 2009 - may have been wrongly imprisoned			2
investigators claim key pieces of evidence in the case against @entity32 - including a fragment of circuit board for a timer - were faked			0
they also allege the bomb was planted in luggage at @entity48 in @entity24 - not loaded by @entity32 in @entity49 , as the prosecution claimed during his trial in 2001			0
and they say @entity1 - who was an initial suspect in the case - met with other @entity55 terror suspects in the run - up to the bombing			1
the report - written in 2002 - was supposed to form part of @entity32 's appeal in 2009 , but it was never used			0
horrific : @entity4 exploded over @entity4 , @entity19 , on december 22 , 1988 - killing 270 people wreckage : eleven people in the @entity19 town were killed when parts of the plane plummeted to the ground jailed : @entity33 @entity32 , pictured left and right , was jailed in 2001 for masterminding the bombing however , it is due to be aired in an @entity70 tv documentary this week			1
its authors - @entity73 , a former @entity75 chief assistant district attorney , and @entity77 police officer @entity76 - expect their findings to provoke calls for the case to be re-opened			0
they conclude : ' we have never seen a criminal investigation in which there has been such a consistent disregard of an alternative and far more persuasive theory of the case			0
' @entity1 , now 59 , was jailed for life in 1989 after carrying out bombings in @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 - killing one person and reportedly injuring a further 20			2
cover - up ? the private investigation has accused the @entity25 of covering up @entity1 's role in the terrorist atrocity he has always denied any involvement in the @entity4 bombing - and even gave evidence against @entity32 during his trial in return for immunity from prosecution			1
however , @entity105 expert @entity104 later claimed the terrorist had been paid $ 500,000 ( £ 307,000 ) just months after the atrocity			0
and @entity108 suggests police were misled in their investigation due to a government agency - most likely , the @entity25 - deliberately covering up the true culprit			2
ms @entity113 and mr @entity76 said the five - month inquiry ' leads us to believe the investigation into the @entity4 bombing was directed off - course as a result of government interference			1
' denial : @entity1 , now 59 , has always denied any involvement in the attack over @entity4 ( pictured ) in @entity123 they added : ' in our experience , the decision to intervene would have been made at the highest level of government , most likely a top executive of the @entity25			1
' earlier this year , members of the @entity4 investigation team - including officers from @entity134 - visited @entity33 to look into possible leads which could result in further convictions for the bombing			1
however , @entity33 authorities later said they did not want to ' dig into the past ' amid fears they could be forced to pay out further compensation to the families of the victims			0
tragic : the @entity145 's front page following the @entity4 bombing on december 22 , 1988 the @entity4 bombing remains the worst terrorist attack to have been committed in the @entity149			1
on december 21 , 1988 , @entity4 exploded over the @entity19 town of @entity4 as it flew to @entity75 from @entity151 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed - while a further 11 on the ground below also died			1
some of the victims ' bodies were never found			0
in november 1991 , murder warrants were issued for two @entity33 nationals - @entity33 agent @entity159 and @entity161 station manager @entity160			0
however , @entity32 was the only person found guilty of murder			0
he was controversially freed from a @entity19 jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer			0
he died in @entity33 aged 60 last year			0
ministers insisted @entity32 's early release was a decision taken solely by the @entity19 government			0
