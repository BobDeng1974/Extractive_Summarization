in one recent post , she said : ' you already knew you wanted to marry a @entity29 [ a person who is engaged in jihad ] so why did you not read up on what will be the rulings for you after his departure ? ' sisters , it is very important you read up on all the information you can find on your @entity38 [ period of waiting ] , it 's rules and regulations			2
' it is not clear from her online posts whether the militant husband she flew to the war - torn country to marry has been killed			1
the former medical student , who now calls herself @entity49 , also warned women that they need to learn the proper dress etiquette for widows			1
she added : ' be prepared for what you can and can not wear			2
' most importantly know your rights as a @entity57 [ single muslim woman ]			2
' ' do n't let anyone tell you you ca n't do such and such when you are allowed			2
do n't live in ignorance , ukhti [ my sister ]			2
' it is not the first time the former @entity65 schoolgirl has taken to social media			1
last year , she wrote on @entity67 how would - be jihadis could follow in her footsteps			1
in another outburst , she urged extremists to carry out ' another @entity72 ' , referring to the barbaric murder of soldier @entity74			2
she has also previously advised wannabe @entity7 wives to bring clothes , books and cosmetics to @entity3			1
she reportedly became radicalised by ' online material ' in 2013 , she travelled to @entity95 after dropping out of a diagnostic radiotherapy degree course			1
it is believed she went on to marry an @entity7 fighter			0
her parents @entity100 , 51 , and wife @entity101 , 44 , have previously begged their daughter to come home and said she had ' betrayed ' her family			0
in a statement released after their daughter fled , they said : ' we still love you but we now have to put your family , your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us , our community and the people of @entity65 when you took this step			1
' all parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we feel nothing but sorrow and shame			0
you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever , please come home			0
' in a message to @entity126 , her parents @entity100 ( right ) and @entity101 ( left ) said she had ' betrayed them ' and added : ' you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever			0
please come home ' @entity131 , believed to be @entity132 , who fled to @entity3 from @entity133 , @entity134 jihadists from @entity133 who fled to @entity3 were ' talent spotted ' by a secret @entity7 agent in @entity134 , a leading security expert has claimed			1
professor @entity140 , a former @entity141 adviser who has published six books on national security , said ' recruiting sergeants ' for the terrorist group were roaming @entity134 cities in search of new recruits			0
he said @entity133 brothers @entity132 and @entity149 , as well as their friend @entity150 , were all likely to have been groomed by @entity7 after meeting undercover agents in @entity134			0
the trio all travelled to @entity3 last year to join extremist fighters			1
sleeper agents for the group would ' talent spot ' intelligent or charismatic young people who expressed a ' resentment ' towards @entity9 foreign policy , the @entity157 professor warned			1
he said : ' i would be very sure that this was the case [ with the @entity132 brothers and @entity150 ] and i think many @entity57 community leaders would say the same thing			0
' i believe @entity7 has people on the ground who are acting as recruiting sergeants who look out for people like this and then approach them to begin the radicalisation process			0
' people are not just radicalised online			0
they are approached by what we might call @entity7 's recruiting sergeants - people who deliberately go around schools , campuses and @entity183 community centres looking for people like this			1
' their friends may see them as idealistic and interested in politics and that 's the kind of person @entity7 is looking to recruit			0
it has been like that for a very long time			0
' they will play on the resentments they may have about @entity196 , or about the @entity198 war , and they will look out for people who are up for it because they are disillusioned			0
' they know that if you get them while they are young then you have them for ever			0
' professor @entity140 said the @entity132 brothers and @entity150 could have been groomed by a secret @entity7 agent who passed them instructions on how to join jihadists in @entity3			1
' you can not just get on a plane and walk to the @entity7			0
you have got to find a way to cross the border from @entity216 and you need to have made personal contact with people who will know how to do that , ' he said			0
he called for teachers to be vigilant about ' disillusioned ' pupils who could be seduced by @entity7 's ' sophisticated ' propaganda machine			0
' we must make sure these people do n't sit and brood			0
that 's what teachers are there for , to discuss these issues in a democratic fashion , ' he said			0
professor @entity140 also warned that once young @entity9 joined the terror group they were on a ' path of no return ' and could never rejoin @entity9 society because they were so severely brainwashed			1
' when they join the @entity7 they are lost for ever			1
once they become extremists they are always extremists			0
' i do n't believe there are significant number of people going out to fight with the @entity7 who get there and say , ' oh , this is terrible , and we were so wrong about believing in this			0
' former medical student and @entity133 schoolboy @entity132 appeared in a propaganda video for @entity7 with friend @entity150 - also from the @entity134 capital - sat alongside him ( together above ) in june last year ' there is nothing we can do about them once they have gone out there			1
they can certainly never be allowed to come back because once they are radicalised there is no way of bringing them back to @entity9 democratic values			1
' it is also undeniably the case that these people coming back from the @entity7 represent a real and present national security threat to the @entity9			1
' there are some who say that on the one hand it is extremely wrong to go and fight for @entity7 but on the other almost 100 years ago people went to fight the @entity276 and that was seen as a noble thing			0
' but my view would be that they fought for democratic values against totalitarianism			0
' with @entity7 it is the other way round - they are fighting for totalitarianism against democratic values			2
' last june , former medical student @entity132 , from @entity133 , appeared in a propaganda video for @entity7 with friend @entity150 - also from the @entity134 capital - sat alongside him			2
the pair , both 20 when they fled for @entity3 , were later joined by @entity132 's teenage brother , @entity293			1
the brothers - who both attended a @entity133 primary school - left behind their stunned family in the city			2
their father , 57 - year - old @entity298 , said : ' i feel very sad			2
not only shocking - devastating			2
' a @entity141 spokesman said : ' we are working in communities across the country to challenge terrorist ideology , including disrupting extremist speakers and removing material online , and intervene when people are at risk of being radicalised and exploited			2
' but we are clear that we will take the strongest possible action against those who have travelled to @entity3 or @entity198 and return with the intention of doing harm - both through our existing powers and by introducing new ones through the counter-terrorism and @entity317 - to make sure we can defend ourselves against the serious and rapidly changing threats emerging from the region			1
