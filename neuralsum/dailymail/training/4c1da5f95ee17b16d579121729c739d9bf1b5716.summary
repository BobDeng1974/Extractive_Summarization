the last remaining @entity1 citizen held abroad by a terrorist group was given a hero 's welcome on his return home after he was freed by @entity7 militants in @entity8			1
but questions remain over whether a ransom was paid for @entity12 's freedom or if he was released as part of a prisoner exchange after spending three - years in captivity			1
' being a hostage is a bit difficult , it 's not easy , ' @entity12 told reporters shortly after he touched down on the tarmac of @entity22 airport near @entity23			2
' but life is beautiful , to be freed again			0
the french citizen was freed by @entity7 militants in @entity8 after being held in captivity for three - years			1
questions remain over whether he was freed in a prisoner exchange @entity12 's daughter @entity34 ( left ) campaigned tirelessly for his release , urging @entity1 president @entity36 to do everything he could to secure his release by @entity39			1
she flew back to @entity1 with her father after meeting him in @entity43 's capital @entity41 @entity12 was greeted by @entity1 president @entity36 ( right ) at the @entity22 airport near @entity23			1
@entity36 credited credited cooperation of the governments of @entity8 and @entity43 , but @entity1 authorities provided no details of the liberation ' i forgot what freedom is , do n't ever forget , ' he added			1
' be careful because freedom is the most priceless thing			0
' during his time in captivity , he said he had lost around three stone , before going on to thank the people and president of @entity43 who worked with @entity1 to secure his freedom			1
@entity36 also credited the cooperation of the governments of @entity8 and @entity43 , but @entity1 authorities provided no details about the liberation			1
worryingly for some , @entity12 may have been freed in a trade			2
a few days before his release , two fighters from the group known as @entity66 were freed from imprisonment in @entity8 , a security official in @entity8 told the @entity70 they had been jailed for @entity12 's kidnapping and that of his colleague , @entity73			1
the fighters were transferred to mediators in @entity43 on saturday , before rejoining their colleagues in the terrorist group , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety			2
@entity36 has denied that @entity1 any pays ransoms for hostages but @entity12 's sudden liberation will once again raise accusations that @entity1 has paid ransoms to have its citizens freed			1
countries like @entity89 and @entity90 oppose this , arguing that it funds terrorism and encourages further kidnappings at a later date			0
after @entity12 's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last @entity7 video , his daughter @entity34 urged the @entity1 president to do everything possible to secure his release during his three years in captivity , @entity103 appeared in several videos released by @entity7 but former anti-terrorism judge @entity106 was far more sceptical on the subject of a paid ransom			1
' there is no reason for heated debate			0
we pay , we pay and that is all , ' he told @entity115			0
' there is no release if there is no payment			0
someone paid , if not the government , a business or insurance company			0
' while tight lipped on the details , @entity36 was nonetheless jubilant at the return of his countryman			2
' we 've been waiting for you for three years , ' he said with the ex-hostage at his side			0
' three years you 've suffered			0
it 's a joy to welcome you back			0
' warning @entity1 citizens to avoid risky zones , he mentioned @entity73 , who along with @entity139 , was kidnapped from a hotel in @entity141 in northeastern @entity8 in november 2011			1
their families have said they were doing a feasibility study for a cement factory			0
@entity73 , who suffered from an ulcer and tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - was found shot dead last year , and those close to his family suggested he had been executed as he was unwell			0
' make sure you do n't go where you can be kidnapped , @entity36 warned			2
we 're in a dangerous world			0
there are zones where you should n't travel ... we know the risks			0
' @entity12 is the last of more than a dozen @entity1 citizens taken captive in recent years , with those held in @entity160 reaching a high of 15 last year			1
he was met by his daughter @entity34 in @entity43 's capital @entity41 before making his way back to @entity1			2
during his three years in captivity , he appeared in several videos released by @entity7			1
the most recent emerged in november and showed @entity12 claiming to be so gravely ill that he believed his life was in danger			2
fears spiked for the safety of the towering @entity1 of @entity173 origin in september after hiker @entity174 was abducted in neighbouring @entity175 and beheaded by @entity177 - linked militants			2
after @entity12 's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last @entity7 video , his daughter urged @entity36 to do everything possible to secure his release in time for @entity39			1
failed rescue : only this week @entity89 - born @entity90 photographer @entity186 ( left ) was shot dead by @entity7 militants in @entity188 after @entity90 special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation rather than make a ransom payment to the terror group			1
@entity194 teacher @entity193 ( right ) was also executed he was accused , alongside @entity73 of being a @entity1 intelligence agent by @entity66			2
their families have always denied these allegations			0
the pair were in the hands of @entity66 as it and other hardline @entity202 groups launched a takeover of vast areas of northern @entity8 in 2012 , and as they were in turn ousted by the @entity1 army who intervened in january the following year			1
uncertainty remains over the fate of another @entity1 hostage , @entity212 , whose death was claimed by an @entity66 splinter group but whose remains have never been found			1
' we have the grimmest information concerning him			0
but , @entity1 has no more hostages , it must have no more hostages , ' @entity36 said			2
while the details of @entity12 's release were not given , @entity1 has repeatedly denied paying ransoms despite being accused of using back - channels to do so by other @entity229 nations			1
' @entity1 does not pay ransoms , nor does @entity1 engage in prisoner exchanges , ' @entity36 said in september			1
but he added : ' this does not mean that countries do not do it			0
it has happened that some countries , to help us , do it			0
' @entity241 ( pictured ) said @entity1 does not pay ransoms but a @entity8 official said two @entity66 fighters who had been imprisoned in @entity8 for @entity12 's kidnapping were freed days before his release the majority of foreign nationals held by the likes of @entity7 and @entity177 have been freed , with the terrorist groups themselves claiming @entity89 and the @entity90 are the only countries who do not make secret payments			1

four @entity1 journalists held by @entity259 jihadists were released earlier this year			2
only this week @entity89 - born @entity90 photographer @entity186 was shot dead by @entity7 militants in @entity188 while @entity90 special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation			0
the mission was ordered by @entity264 after terrorists had on thursday threatened to kill photographer @entity186 , 33 , within 72 hours unless a ransom was paid			0
