snapchat co-founder @entity13 ( left ) said @entity12 's @entity14 warned him he planned to launch a rival service unless he sold @entity21 then allegedly offered $ 4 billion ( £ 2.4 billion ) for the company but was similarly rejected			0
the terms of the latest funding round may change , according to a report by @entity26 , who said that it had spoken to sources close to the company			1
@entity30 at @entity31 points out that @entity35 , makers of @entity33 and an @entity4 competitor , are a covert investor in @entity1			1

@entity1 is reportedly in talks with investors , including @entity4 , for financing that could value the company at $ 10 billion ( £ 5.9 billion ) @entity47 has launched a new ephemeral messaging app called @entity49			1
the app , which functions in a similar way to @entity1 , allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend			2
like @entity1 , the user can tap on a friend 's face to instantly send a photo , or hold their finger down to send a video			2
however , @entity49 only allows you to send messages to one person at a time , which makes it frustrating if you ’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends			0
the favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends , though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total			0
@entity49 is currently only available in @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81			0
@entity1 is continuing to grow in popularity , with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day			2
last month , @entity12 acted on its warning by launching @entity86 , a similar smartphone app , in the hope of replicating @entity1 ’s success			2
the app allows consumers to exchange photos and videos , which will later disappear , without requiring @entity12 accounts			0
but despite its rapid growth , @entity1 has had a number of obstacles to contend with			0
the group this year settled charges with @entity101 regulators , which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time			0
according to the @entity110 at the time , photos sent on @entity1 could , in fact , be saved by recipients using several methods			0
neither @entity1 nor @entity115 - based e-commerce group , @entity4 , were available for comment			1
@entity35 , makers of @entity33 and an @entity4 competitor , are a covert investor in @entity1			1
if @entity4 does invest it the app , it could intensify competition between the two groups as they as they battle it out to become leaders in @entity42 ’s tech industry			1

@entity35 , an @entity4 competitor , are also a covert investor in @entity1
if @entity4 does invest , it could intensify competition between the groups
