' we have all been feeling on edge and now this has happened			0
it ’s not just the people at the mosque we are worried about , it ’s our wives , daughters and children who are out in the community			2

' at the end of the day what we say needs context			0
nobody is saying go out and do something like that , stab someone in the street , but if you do n't talk about the foreign policy you have to think about the implications			0
' he also spoke against calls to ban ' hate ' sermons			0
he said : ' i would say that the question is should @entity20 have love or hatred towards the @entity55 foreign policy ? ' if @entity309 is now saying that @entity20 must love what is taking place in @entity354 and in @entity355 then i 'm afraid that the vast majority of @entity20 around the world have nothing but contempt for the occupation of @entity20 lands and the murder of innocent women and children			0
