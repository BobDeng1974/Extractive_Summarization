@entity0 has said he is happy with @entity2 ’s on - field behaviour and will not be asking the leader of his attack to tone down the verbals in thursday ’s fourth @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity0 ’s defence of @entity2 came only a couple of hours after the @entity11 chief executive @entity10 said he would not be appealing against justice @entity13 ’s decision to exonerate both @entity2 and @entity14 following their set - to in the @entity15 last month			1
but @entity10 also warned that there was there was ‘ no place in the game for the use of offensive language that is personally insulting of one player by another ’ – a statement that seemed aimed squarely at @entity2 following events in @entity21			1
happy : @entity0 ( left ) does not want @entity2 ( right ) to tone down the verbals on the pitch @entity30 : @entity2 is composed off the pitch but changes when he is playing @entity0 admitted he had never played with a cricketer whose off - field and on - field personas were as different as @entity2 ’s			1
but he said : ‘ i do n’t think anyone should moan about it , because what happens on the field should stay on the field and off the field you should be a nice guy			2
‘ the way both sides have played this series has been fantastic , about from that one incident which has been blown up			2
both sides have been very competitive and played it in the right spirit			2
‘ every time you pull on the shirt you ’re role models for kids			2
we ’re aware of that , but we want to play competitive cricket , not nicey nicey , and everyone say you ’re playing in the right spirit			2
there ’s always that muddied line			2
‘ we want to play competitive cricket , do n’t need to change too much			0
i am happy with @entity2 and his conduct			1
there are little bits where he might have overstepped the mark but i ’d rather he was on that line than too passive			0
he needs that for his bowling			0
back up off the floor : @entity0 was boosted by his own performance and that of his team in the win over @entity67 recipe for success : @entity0 will look to build on the victory at the @entity71 ‘ @entity2 ’s an experienced cricketer and he ’s found his method that he needs to be @entity74 ’s second - leading wicket taker			1
i 'm pretty sure he 'll be @entity74 's leading wicket taker very soon and that 's an outstanding achievement			1
he 's found his way of doing it			1
‘ i know it ’s very special for him to play at a home test match			0
for him to be playing here means a lot for him			0
that was his biggest concern , that he would n’t be able to play at @entity85			1
’ @entity0 also praised @entity86 for fighting back from a situation in @entity88 where he was deemed ‘ unselectable ’			1
@entity86 could play his first test for 13 months if he ’s picked on a surface that is expected to suit his height and bounce – with @entity93 the man most likely to miss out			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it ’s great , from where i last saw him in an @entity74 shirt in that one - day tour , to what he ’s now delivering for @entity101 , and briefly how bowled to us in the nets at @entity104 and here these last two days as well			1
‘ it ’s great for @entity107 cricket that he ’s back to his best			0
he ’s very different to what we ’ve got			0
he ’s a tall bowler who when he gets it right bowls at 90mph			0
' that ’s a good thing to add to the pot. it ’s been a very tough six months for him personally to fight through it , and i think he ’ll be a stronger bloke for it			0
it should bode well for his cricket			0
’ @entity121 hints at @entity86 return happier now : @entity86 knocks in a stump using an implement with a smiley face as he trains with @entity74 not finnished : the tall fast bowler sends one down as he looks to be included in the side for the fourth test fall guy : should @entity86 come back into the @entity74 side , @entity93 is likely to miss out meanwhile , @entity67 captain @entity130 said he had no regrets over pursuing the case against @entity2 , and said it was up to individual captains to control their players			1
but he said match officials should play a greater role in ensuring the game is played in the right spirit : ‘ it ’s important that cricket has strong characters – no matter what side they play for			0
but what needs to be done is for umpires to step in if the individual crosses the line			0
if the individual stays within the guidelines , it ’s good for the game			0
‘ if he carries on being abusive and can not curb his instincts , he should definitely be punished			0

@entity2 was in hot water for alleged *altercation* with @entity14
@entity11 found him not guilty , then *announced* they will not appeal against *ruling*
@entity2 's on - field and off - field personas very different
@entity162 's biggest concern was that he *'d* be *banned* for @entity163
@entity86 could come in for @entity74 , with @entity93 missing out
