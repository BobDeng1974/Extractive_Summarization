reverend @entity0 of @entity1 in @entity2 weeps after the session which allowed women bishops the @entity5 finally voted yesterday to let women become bishops – to the anger of many traditionalists			1
the move was passed by a comfortable majority at a tense gathering of its parliament , the @entity13 , in @entity15			1
it ended 14 years of hand - wringing and faction - fighting , delighting archbishop of canterbury @entity19 and almost all of his fellow bishops			2
the decision freed the @entity5 from the risk of intervention by politicians			2
mps had threatened to step in to force the @entity5 to accept women bishops in 2012 , after a disastrously botched vote saw traditionalists narrowly block reform			1
@entity31 described yesterday ’s vote as ‘ a great day for the @entity5 and for equality ’			1
@entity34 said it was ‘ wonderful news ’ , while @entity36 called the decision a ‘ long overdue step ’			0
but some evangelical conservatives and @entity40 – a branch of the church which affirms its @entity44 heritage – were left divided and angry , having long argued that the @entity45 and tradition do not permit women to become bishops			0
one said he had ‘ betrayed ’ his supporters , while others accused @entity13 members of being too worried about outside reaction			0
their comments provoked protests from @entity5 liberals and left the @entity13 chairman , the archbishop of york @entity58 , calling for quiet , telling its members not to behave like rowdy mps			1
the crucial vote , in which lay members of the @entity13 approved women bishops by a majority of more than three to one , led to clapping and a single shout of ‘ brill ’			1
only @entity70 formalities now remain before the @entity5 can appoint its first female bishop			0
this is expected to come early next year , 21 years after women were first ordained as priests by the @entity5			1
the @entity5 set up the committees and inquiries that led to yesterday ’s vote in 2000			1
what went on before ? the vote in the @entity13 that was meant to finally approve women bishops ended in narrow defeat for reformers in november 2012			1
who is opposed ? anglo - catholics , who believe the @entity45 and tradition do not allow women bishops , and conservative evangelicals , who believe the @entity45 says women should not be church leaders			1
what is different now ? in 2012 , it was felt there were too few provisions for those opposed to female bishops			0
but @entity5 leaders have now drawn up a new compromise , including a dispute procedure			0
how does the new plan work ? the @entity5 has laid out principles saying that women shall have the full powers of male bishops and that everyone must recognise the decision			2
all dioceses , even those dominated by traditionalists , must include a junior bishop who will ordain and promote women			0
but it recognises that opponents of women bishops have the right to ‘ flourish ’ – so there must be ‘ pastoral and sacramental provision ’ for disputes			2
what about disputes ? church councils which oppose the move can send their bishop a resolution stating that they do not want a woman vicar or clergy , nor any male priests who have been ordained by women bishops			1
they should then be sent male clergy when jobs become vacant			0
if an objecting parish is in a diocese run by a woman bishop , she will allow it to be supervised by a male junior bishop			0
if no junior bishop is available within the diocese , one can be brought in from outside			0
what if there are still arguments ? there will be an appeals system , in which parishes can turn to an ‘ independent reviewer ’			0
but if a parish does not accept an appeal decision they can be subject to disciplinary action , which can culminate in dismissal from the @entity5			0
@entity162 , pictured right , is overwhelmed with emotion beside @entity165 after the @entity13 in @entity15 the first appointment may be seen as an anti-climax , with a woman picked to fill a junior post , subordinate to a male bishop			2
after the vote , the archbishop of @entity15 led the @entity13 in a rendition of we are marching in the @entity175 , with members clapping along , some even shedding tears of joy			1
reverend dr @entity179 , from @entity181 diocese , said yesterday : ‘ i ’m absolutely joyful , thank @entity182 after 20 years of very hard work we now have a decision that can help us work for everyone in the @entity5			1
yesterday ’s vote came nearly 20 months after the @entity5 ’s last attempt to approve a law allowing women bishops			1
the lost @entity13 vote in november 2012 left the then archbishop of @entity192 , @entity193 , humiliated and apparently with little hope of reviving the cause for several years			1
but a new compromise , which allows scope for traditionalists to challenge the appointment of a female bishop in their parish , was brought to the vote in record time			0
the plan is based on the hope of compromise between opposing liberals and conservatives			0
archbishop @entity19 said @entity5 members must ‘ continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds ’			2
he added : ‘ as delighted as i am for the outcome of this vote i am also mindful of those within the @entity5 for whom the result will be difficult and a cause of sorrow			2
’ during the debate , @entity220 traditionalist @entity219 said he would reverse his position from 2012 and vote in favour			0
‘ by doing so , i am betraying what i believe , i am betraying those who trusted in me , ’ he said			0
‘ i hope that the promised commitment to mutual flourishing is not a commitment that will run out of steam in a few years			0
’ but opponent dr @entity230 , of @entity231 , said : ‘ men and women are equal but their roles are not interchangeable ... if we allow the @entity5 to be guided by secular thinking our teaching will soon unravel			2
’ in 2012 , the @entity238 voted just six short of the necessary two to one majority			0
yesterday , it voted 152 to 45 for women bishops			1
members of the clergy arrive for the @entity13 of @entity5 meeting at the @entity245 the archbishop of @entity192 arrived for the @entity13 of @entity5 meeting at the @entity245 today deputy prime minister @entity36 welcomed the ' watershed moment ' for the @entity5 , after the @entity13 overwhelmingly backed the measure to scrap the ban more than two thirds of the members of the @entity5 's @entity13 , pictured here during morning prayers this morning , voted for the consecration of women bishops the @entity257 @entity19 said the @entity5 had been wrong on women bishops ' theologically ' for centuries the archbishop of @entity192 said he would be ' delighted ' to see a woman take his role in his lifetime			1

@entity5 scrapped the ban in a *historic* vote in @entity15 yesterday
archbishop of @entity192 *warned* the @entity5 had been wrong on the issue
@entity13 blocked women bishops in november 2012 by just six votes
the move comes 20 years after women were allowed to become priests
move was passed with an overwhelming majority of 152 to 45
