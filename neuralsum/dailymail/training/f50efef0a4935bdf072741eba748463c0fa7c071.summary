@entity12 , the elder of the brothers at 26 years , from @entity99 , @entity7 , said : ' we are thrilled to be entering a partnership with @entity27 and @entity15			0
when @entity26 approached us we jumped at the chance because we felt that we share the same ethical values and we have always been inspired by @entity26 , as he is a great businessman			0
' as previously reported in @entity104 , @entity12 and @entity13 , 24 , started their business from nothing after surviving the @entity4			2
they were travelling with their parents , @entity108 and @entity109 , and other siblings when they were caught up in the natural disaster while they were staying in @entity9 in 2004			2

' the prime minister @entity92 has also given them his full backing and met the brothers during their visit to @entity9 as he was also in the country for the @entity97 leaders summit their parents had managed to get their younger brother , @entity130 , then aged 12 , and sister , @entity131 , eight , to safety before being swept away			1
the orphans were left with nothing and had to hitchhike across the devastated country to make it back to @entity20 where they would be cared for by their extended family and friends			2
but rather than being broken by the tragedy , the brothers decided to do something positive to honour the memory of their mother and father and help other orphaned children around the world			1
taking inspiration from their philanthropist parents , who had given up their jobs in the fashion industry to volunteer for humanitarian projects , the pair designed flip flops made from natural materials with a woven rope style			0
