by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 05:43 est , 20 august 2013 when @entity3 began the final negotiations to sign @entity5 from @entity6 , @entity2 ’s chief executive arrived with a battery of lawyers and accountants by his side			1
they all went into a private meeting room with @entity6 officials , breaking off for hushed conversations in corridors whenever the selling club raised the stakes			1
by then @entity5 had , unknowingly , been the subject of a complicated economic formula established by the @entity21 business boffins employed on a sizeable retainer by the club			1
problems : a resigned @entity25 looks on from the bench as @entity2 lose to @entity27 the bid @entity2 have submitted for @entity30 and @entity31 midfielder @entity29 appears , on the surface , to be a knee - jerk reaction to the injury crisis and the pressure put on them by fans to ‘ @entity38 ’ during their defeat against @entity27			1
instead , he has been on the radar of @entity2 ’s @entity42 scout @entity41 for some time			1
but the businessmen across the pond slow down the recruitment process			0
@entity3 ’ belief in their academic acumen is total , although he has always been reluctant to explain how players as bad as @entity50 , told he could skip training to go back to @entity52 three weeks ago , is earning £ 55,000 a week			0
@entity53 , who earns £ 7.6million a year at the @entity54 , authorised @entity50 ’s contract when the striker was still boasting about becoming the best player in the world			1
@entity2 are proud of their due diligence , justifying frugal spending in the @entity61 years by the business brains brought in to put every potential recruit through a complicated financial model			1
crocked : @entity5 could be out for six months after his knee injury @entity53 believes in the scientific principles established at the @entity54 , although his team of scouts around the world still work to the formula he brought with him in 1996			1
his scouting team , headed by @entity72 , are asked to identify players with three distinctive characteristics : pace , power and football intelligence			0
if only they had added a fourth — the mentality of champions — they really would be in business			0
the dynamic training - ground environment , which was once the envy of the world when @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 were pushing each other to reach new targets each day , has slowly been eroded			0
there is tension in the air between @entity72 and @entity94 , @entity2 ’s head of youth			1
at games , they do n’t even speak to each other			0
glory days : @entity88 and @entity87 were iconic figures during @entity2 's success they should be in constant communication , preserving the future of the club by monitoring the progress of young players at @entity2 ’s academy and bringing in the next generation			1
instead , the young @entity110 are on the end of some hidings , losing 7 - 0 to @entity114 club @entity113 and beaten by a scratch team of @entity117 kids 5 - 1 before the start of the season			1
this is no way to run a football club and most people know that there is room for improvement in every area at @entity2			1
@entity53 has too much power — given the freedom of the football club because of his achievements at @entity131			2
there he won three @entity134 titles , four @entity135 and took @entity2 to within a whisker of beating @entity137 at the @entity31 in 2006			2
he knows the inner workings of every area of the club , which is rare in the modern game			0
spend , spend , spend : an @entity2 fan makes his feelings known to @entity53 @entity53 ’s detailed knowledge of every player ’s contract even created an issue when @entity5 was making substitute appearances for @entity2 last season			1
written into the @entity152 winger ’s deal is a clause stating that @entity2 must pay @entity6 £ 10,000 every time @entity5 appears for more than 20 minutes			1
incredibly a trend emerged , with @entity53 bringing him off the bench after 72 minutes ( v @entity156 ) , 73 minutes ( @entity157 ) , 72 minutes ( @entity158 ) , 65 minutes ( @entity159 ) , 76 minutes ( @entity160 ) , 86 minutes ( @entity161 ) , 67 minutes ( @entity162 ) , 73 minutes ( @entity163 ) , 71 minutes ( @entity162 ) , and 75 minutes ( @entity164 )			2
@entity2 ’s accounts department were stunned to receive an email from @entity6 demanding payment for the appearances , with the south coast club justifying their argument based on stoppage time			1
eventually @entity2 agreed to pay for the appearances and the story worked its way around the offices at the @entity54 with bafflement among staff			2
they know @entity53 calls the shots , but he is slow to move for targets			2
slow : @entity2 were too late when it came to trying to sign @entity181 from @entity182 last season @entity72 was a regular at @entity182 matches , following @entity181 around the country as @entity2 stepped up their interest			2
@entity72 would pop up at @entity185 or @entity186 , watching @entity187 closely as @entity182 headed for the play - offs and promotion back to the @entity134			0
when it came to the crunch , @entity53 ’s assistant manager @entity190 picked up the phone to an old friend at @entity182 to ask for his assessment of the £ 15m forward			2
by then it was too late			0
@entity187 had been given permission to meet sir @entity198 and the deal was wrapped up within a day			0
the @entity152 winger is another one to get away , but everyone at @entity2 knows that @entity53 — a thoroughly charming and decent guy — has failed to keep pace with the modern game			1
managers need technical assistance and expertise , something the top clubs in the @entity134 have finally accepted			0
partnership : @entity209 works with director of football @entity210 to recruit players at @entity213 at @entity213 , @entity209 has returned to @entity214 on the understanding that he must work closely with director of football @entity210 on transfer targets			0
@entity217 is working under the technical team — @entity219 and @entity220 — as @entity221 plan for five trophies in five years			0
@entity161 have recruited @entity223 from @entity224 to work with @entity225 as @entity226 returns to the two - tiered @entity42 management structure he has always favoured			0
@entity53 has never been interested , preferring to rely on his own judgment and using @entity230 ’s contacts book when they make a move on a player			2
law , who is based in @entity235 , met @entity53 when he was working in south @entity236 and they became close during @entity239 ’s time as vice-president			0
he is popular with agents around the world , but they become frustrated when he pulls the plug on deals because @entity53 must always have the final word			0
as @entity2 fans are aware , nothing adds up at the @entity54 any more .			0

@entity53 failing to keep pace with big rivals
arguments with @entity6 over @entity5 's appearance fee
tension between coaches is ruining @entity2 's youth teams
@entity110 ' transfer *policy* decided by @entity21 boffins ' economic formula
