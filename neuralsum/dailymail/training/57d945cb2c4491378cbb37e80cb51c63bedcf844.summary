@entity0 is a @entity1 fan with a @entity3 season ticket and he 's has been a regular at @entity5 for more than 40 years			1
with his team about to make their first major signing of the summer in the form of former @entity10 midfielder @entity9 , the @entity12 supporter explains why @entity1 fans wo n't be welcoming the 27 - year - old to @entity5 with open arms			1
only 12 months after the relief of getting rid of @entity18 , the faithful at @entity5 are being asked to warm to his on - field equivalent … @entity9			1
try to think of a more unpopular current player for a @entity1 fan and you are struggling			0
controversy : @entity9 has n't been a popular figure amongst @entity1 fans incident : @entity28 ( centre ) is kicked in the face by @entity10 's @entity31 while @entity9 complains about a piece of celery thrown onto the pitch up for a fight : @entity9 ( right ) gets to grips with @entity36 during @entity38 win in 2007 obviously there is @entity40 - you just have to look at him to be wound up - and @entity42 combines being objectionable with actually playing for @entity43			1
but @entity44 ’s finest is generally hopeless when he faces @entity1			0
no , @entity9 is the one			0
he has more previous than @entity18 , who stoked the rivalry between @entity5 and @entity46 and will never be forgiven for his plastic flag taunts			0
even winning the @entity48 as ‘ interim ’ manager when he replaced cult hero @entity50 was not enough			0
rival : @entity52 revealed @entity36 and @entity9 did n't like each other on the pitch big shoes to fill : @entity9 has his work cut out if he is to emulate @entity36 's historic career at @entity1 it started in 2007 at the @entity59 during the @entity38 against @entity10			1
this was the one where @entity28 took a kick in the face and ended up in hospital but precious little @entity9 was more interested in complaining to the referee about some harmless celery throwing when he was taking a corner			1
then , as @entity36 attempted to calm down a brawl which led to three sendings off , the chippy @entity69 grabbed hold of him around the neck , starting a long - running feud			2
dislike : @entity28 ( right ) squares up to the @entity1 - bound midfielder during a @entity77 match in 2007 @entity36 is a proper legend , rightly revered throughout the game , but pictures of him facing @entity9 in games against @entity10 and @entity81 show the two squaring up			1
in 2012 , before the @entity1 vs @entity84 semi-final @entity52 gave an insight into his former team - mate on twitter			0
‘ i think @entity9 would love to score tonight ... him and @entity36 never liked each other on the pitch , ’ tweeted @entity52			2
well @entity9 did n’t get a goal or a win … and @entity36 was able to lead @entity1 to the trophy in @entity94 a couple of weeks later			2
upset : @entity1 fans were forced to welcome former @entity43 boss @entity18 to their club in 2012 get him out : the @entity12 fans were less than impressed with the temporary appointment @entity99 must have something against @entity1 heroes because he was at it with @entity104 in the season just ended			2
@entity104 made a perfectly reasonable remark about @entity81 not being up to much this season and was told to shut up and mind his own business by the soon - to - be - former @entity110 star			0
still , it seems @entity104 is too big to hold grudges and @entity9 is on his way to the centre of @entity1 ’s midfield			0
of course , there is a significant hole to fill there … but for the sake of our sanity do n’t even think of giving @entity36 ’s @entity123 shirt to @entity124			0
gone , but not forgotten : @entity36 revealed he will leave @entity1 when his contract is up on july 1 nearly done : @entity104 looks set to wrap up the signing of @entity9 before the @entity127			1

@entity9 is n't a popular figure amongst @entity1 fans
@entity133 midfielder has an on - field feud with @entity36
former @entity10 star was complaining about celery when @entity28 had been kicked in the face by @entity31
@entity9 looks set for a summer move to @entity5
