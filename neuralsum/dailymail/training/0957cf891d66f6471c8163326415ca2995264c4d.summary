@entity1 's wilderness remains largely unexplored thanks to its rugged terrain			1
now , to help reach the country 's remotes lakes and glaciers , scientists are using an unconventional mode of transport : a flying rubber dinghy			1
the dinghy is attached to a light aircraft so it can take off on land and water , and it can carry two people up to altitudes of almost 10,000ft ( 3,000 metres )			1
it has a wingspan of 37ft ( 11.15 metres ) and is powered by a two - stroke engine			1
the vehicle is being used by scientists to explore remote areas of @entity1 the vehicle , which can reach up to 50mph ( 80k/h ) is being used by staff at the @entity28 in @entity29 , reports @entity30			1
it has a wingspan of 37ft ( 11.15 metres ) and is powered by a twin cylinder , two - stroke engine fitted with a rear - facing propeller			1
the 551lb ( 250kg ) vehicle carries up to 992lbs ( 450kg ) , including up to two people plus fuel			1
the scientists explained that the craft is also cheap to fly and it has a range of 93 miles ( 150km ) on a full tank of 35 litres			0
during expeditions , the aircraft has reached 50mph ( 80k/h ) and the scientists explained it is cheap to fly			2
it has a range of 93 miles ( 150km ) on a full tank of 35 litres but due to its lightweight nature it is susceptible to strong winds			0
on a recent expedition to @entity58 ( stock image ) it keeled over and needed to be repaired however , due to its lightweight nature it is susceptible to strong winds			0
@entity1 was recently the 66th country to be added to @entity64 's @entity63 mapping service			2
highlights include the @entity66 , on the west coast of @entity1 , and a statue of missionary @entity69 in @entity70			0
@entity64 has also captured @entity71 - @entity73 's estate in the @entity75 colony in south western @entity1			2
on a recent expedition to @entity58 , for example , it was used to collect water samples from remote lakes , but keeled over and needed to be repaired			1
@entity64 recently added @entity1 to its @entity64 's @entity63 mapping service to help armchair explorers visit the region			0
it became the 66th country added to the site			0
highlights include the @entity66 , on the west coast of @entity1 , and a statue of missionary @entity69 in @entity70			0
@entity64 also captured @entity71 - @entity73 's estate in the @entity75 colony in south western @entity1			2
@entity1 was recently the 66th country to be added to @entity64 's @entity63 mapping service and highlights include the @entity66 , on the west coast of @entity1			0
the @entity90 is 155 miles ( 250km ) north of the @entity91 and features the @entity92 ( pictured ) @entity64 has also captured @entity71 , known as @entity71 - @entity73 's estate in the @entity75 colony he established in south western @entity1 at the end of the 10th century			2
a reconstruction of a chapel , said to be the earliest church in the @entity98 , stands near the original site ( pictured ) in the town of @entity101			0

the flying rubber dinghy can travel at up to 50mph ( 80 km / h )
it consists of an *ultralight* aircraft with a rubber dinghy attached *beneath*
this means it take offs and lands on water , powered by a two - stroke engine
the 551lb ( 250kg ) vehicle carries up to 992lbs ( 450kg ) and seats two people
scientists are using the flying dinghy to reach remote lakes in @entity1
