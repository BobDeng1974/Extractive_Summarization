ready : @entity0 says he is willing to serve as @entity1 ' if it is the will of @entity3 ' the first shot in the battle to succeed @entity6 was fired by an @entity8 candidate for the @entity9 yesterday			1
cardinal @entity10 said ‘ young churches ’ of @entity8 and @entity14 were ready to provide worldwide leadership for @entity12			1
the intervention came just 24 hours after @entity6 ’s surprise retirement announcement , and signalled an open struggle for the succession between the @entity20 establishment and the fast - growing catholic churches of the southern hemisphere			2
@entity0 , a 64 - year - old @entity23 , said he was willing to serve as @entity1 himself ‘ if it is the will of @entity3 ’			1
the @entity26 , who has headed the @entity29 office on international peace and justice for the past four years , said that @entity8 and @entity14 churches have produced ‘ mature clergymen and prelates that are capable of exercising leadership also of this world institution ’			1
he said that although the churches of the south had been ‘ growing exponentially ’ under @entity44 , a @entity1 from the south ‘ would go a long way to strengthen them in their resolve ’			1
@entity0 ’s comments open up a rivalry between the @entity20 favourites to succeed @entity6 and candidates from @entity8 , @entity14 and @entity50 , whose churches are perceived as strong and growing at a time when @entity53 are under pressure in their historic strongholds			1
@entity57 complaints about gay rights and the status of women have combined with sex abuse scandals to put a question mark over loyalty to the church and its leadership in @entity66 and @entity67			1
congregations are also seen to be falling as @entity53 lose faith in much of @entity66 and @entity67			2
the @entity23 cardinal , who would be the first ever black @entity1 if elected by next month ’s conclave , said : ‘ i think in a way the church is always and has forever been ready for a @entity1			1
’ @entity0 added that it was vital for the church to restore its authority in the wake of sex scandals			1
‘ being the @entity1 of the church is not going to be an easy task , ’ he said			1
‘ we need to repair our credibility			2
our pastors need to be believed in again and recognised and taken seriously			2
‘ if we say we are celibate clergy , we need to live faithfully to that celibacy			2
there is one thing we can not compromise on and that is our credibility			0
’ cardinal @entity89 from eastern @entity90 has also been linked to the highest office in the faith			1
the election of a black pope could be controversial in parts of @entity66 where racism remains a problem			1
two other contenders , cardinal @entity99 , archbishop of @entity101 , and the @entity104 - @entity103 cardinal @entity102 , would also be a break with the tradition of electing only @entity20 popes			1
@entity90 cardinal @entity89 is seen as an outside contender for the job after the long reign of a @entity113 pope – @entity116 – and a @entity118 pope , the @entity115 catholic church will put a lot of pressure on cardinals to support an @entity115 for the papacy			1
among its favourites are cardinal @entity125 , archbishop of @entity127 , and cardinal @entity128 , archbishop of @entity129			1
@entity6 ’s resignation shocked churchgoers and left the senior ranks of the church in turmoil			2
revealing his decision to a gathering of cardinals on sunday , he said his ‘ strength of mind and body ’ had failed in the last few months			0
the @entity29 denied that any single medical complaint was responsible but speculation centred on 85 - year - old @entity6 ’s arthritis problems			0
@entity115 - @entity145 @entity144 could be the first @entity146 leader of the @entity53 he needs a moving platform to take him to the altar in @entity149 ’s , and it is difficult for him to kneel and pray			1
on monday it emerged that the @entity1 made his decision to quit last april following a tour of @entity153 and @entity154			1
the resignation , to take effect on the last day of this month , means a conclave of senior cardinals will meet in @entity159 to choose a successor by the end of march			0
he sprung his surprise at a meeting to canonise three new saints			0
some cardinals did n’t understand what @entity6 had told them and others looked stunned			0
‘ all the cardinals remained shocked and were looking at each other , ’ said monsignor @entity168 , who was in the room at the time			0
@entity145 @entity174 ( left ) , 77 , and @entity176 cardinal @entity175 ( right ) , 70 , have both been tipped as potential future popes @entity115 cardinal @entity178 ( right ) , 78 , and cardinal @entity128 ( right ) , 70 , are potential candidates for the position which , until @entity116 , was always held by a man from @entity115 after the news was announced to the wider world @entity6 said in a statement : ‘ i have come to the certainty that my strengths , due to an advanced age , are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the @entity149 ministry ( the papacy )			2
@entity99 , 63 , archbishop of @entity191 , is one of the younger contenders for the job ‘ in today ’s world , subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith , in order to govern the bark of @entity149 and proclaim the @entity196 , both strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months , has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me			0
’ a @entity29 spokesman admitted : ‘ it has taken us by surprise a bit			0
’ the @entity214 , cardinal @entity215 , said it was ‘ a bolt from the blue ’			2
among those with knowledge of the state of the @entity1 ’s health is his brother , @entity223 , 89			1
he said yesterday : ‘ his age is weighing on him			0
my brother wants more rest			0
’ the @entity1 had demanding tours ahead of him , including a visit to @entity228 in july for the church ’s @entity229			1
the @entity29 said his immediate future will be spent at @entity232 , the @entity233 south of @entity159 , and that after his resignation he will retreat to a monastery			0
@entity236 , a second year seminarian from the diocese of @entity239 studying at the @entity29 said : ‘ we were absolutely gobsmacked			0
‘ but @entity6 has been a pope of surprises			2
he ’s changed from being the @entity244 to being a @entity245			0
people said he had n’t the charisma of @entity116			0
but he is a great teacher			0
people came to see @entity116 but they come to hear @entity248			0
’ @entity249 said : ‘ his visit to @entity251 in 2010 is remembered with great respect and affection			0
he will be missed as a spiritual leader to millions			0
