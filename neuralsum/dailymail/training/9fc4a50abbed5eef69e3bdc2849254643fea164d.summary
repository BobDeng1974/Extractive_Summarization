by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 4 august 2013 have you embraced the newest super-berry on the block ? the @entity5 lingonberry — a dark red soft fruit			1
research shows drinking the juice can dramatically lower your blood pressure			1
long a feature of @entity12 diets , you can find lingonberry products in @entity14 , @entity15 and health food stores			1
but when it comes to a health boost , all berries pack a powerful punch — and have some rather surprising benefits			1
@entity22 nice ! from strawberries to @entity5 lingonberry - a dark red soft fruit that 's the latest on the block - berries are super health foods @entity28 have one of the highest antioxidant contents of any fruit so they ’re great for protecting against heart disease and cancer			1
but one lesser known benefit is that they strengthen the skeleton			2
a study published in the @entity38 found that a blueberry - rich diet could help develop bone mass. the researchers concluded that compounds called polyphenols ( the pigments that give blueberries their colour ) appear to stimulate bone cell growth			2
a second study suggests blueberries could even help prevent loss in bone mass after the menopause			2
strawberries for your @entity54 the most of that bowl of strawberries and cream this summer			1
not only do strawberries contain more vitamin c than oranges , they are also one of the best cures for constipation			1
the high fibre content of the fruit is known to help improve our bowel function			2
blueberries have one of the highest antioxidant contents of any fruit so they 're great for protecting against heart disease and cancer and unlike prunes , which can have the opposite effect if you ’re not properly hydrated , strawberries are 92 per cent water			1
the seeds ( around 200 in every berry ) sweep through the gut undigested , helping to clean the gut wall and promote colorectal health			2
@entity85 for your @entity87 berry does n’t just liven up apple pie — it can stimulate brain cells , too			2
an animal study found blackberry extracts improved balance , co-ordination and memory			2
the researchers concluded this may be down to the fruit ’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties			0
research by the @entity103 @entity102 on @entity104 even suggests the polyphenols in dark berries improve cognitive function by helping to remove the build - up of toxic proteins in the brain , perhaps protecting against @entity111 ’s			1
@entity112 of redcurrants contains 308mg of the recommended 2,000mg of potassium you need each day			0
potassium is vital to regulate blood pressure and is important for muscles and bones			0
a deficiency could result in muscle cramps , weakness and an irregular heartbeat			0
@entity124 for @entity126 berry , available at larger supermarkets and health food shops , contains more beta - carotene than carrots ( making it excellent for eye health )			0
its iron content ( 7.6mg per 100g ) also far outweighs that of steak ( 3.7mg ) and spinach ( 2.7mg ) combined			0
@entity137 is needed to form haemaglobin , the red pigment in blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen round the body , so a lack of iron can lead to low energy levels and anaemia			0
the figures from the @entity148 show a third of women eat so little iron that it is affecting their health — sprinkle goji on your muesli and you wo n’t be one of them			0
from gojis being great for boosting energy to strawberries being packed with @entity163 , berries really do pack a punch @entity166 berries for your @entity167 double the antioxidants of blueberries , it ’s hardly surprising ‘ the beauty berry ’ , as it has been dubbed in its native @entity171 , is renowned for its anti-ageing benefits			1
one study by @entity174 in the @entity103 found fruit flies lived three times longer if they were given acai supplements compared with a control group			0
it ’s likely this is down to anthocyanins in the fruit — these help protect cells from damage by cancer - causing free radical molecules that occur naturally in the body			0
@entity190 blueberry production has grown by 482 per cent since 2008 the berry is also rich in amino acids and omega fatty acids , which boost hair , skin and nails			1
@entity198 as potent as blueberries when it comes to their antioxidant content , raspberries are also known to have powerful anti-inflammatory properties			0
it is thought these stem from anthocyanins , the pigments that give the berries their vivid colour			1
in animal studies , raspberry extract was found to reduce inflammation , cartilage damage and bone loss , making it a promising treatment for arthritis			0
@entity218 for a happy @entity220 sharp - tasting berries have long been known to promote a healthy bladder , thanks to compounds called proanthocyanidins , which stop @entity226 bacteria from attaching to the bladder wall			1
new research indicates , however , that the trusty cystitis buster could also help fight off @entity231 , a bacteria associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer			0
in one study of women being treated for @entity231 infection , those who were given cranberry juice alongside the usual medication were more likely to be free from the infection at the end of the study .			0
