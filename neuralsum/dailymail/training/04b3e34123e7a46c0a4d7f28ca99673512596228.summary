a family has been left distraught after it was revealed four brothers slipped out of @entity3 last week to join the fight with the @entity5 in the @entity6			1
as authorities attempt to contain home - grown terrorists from leaving the country , the latest recruits from @entity8 have been labelled ' cleanskins ' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence			1
it is thought that the four brothers made their way to @entity17 after they told their parents they were going on a trip to @entity20 , according to the @entity21			1
' we got wind of it after the fact , but the fact is there are still people travelling , ' said @entity26 , the national manager of counter-terrorism for the @entity40			2
1 authorities were alerted last saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country , the @entity21 reports			1
immigration minister @entity48 confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately , it was too late			0
' @entity3 has lost yet another four young kids			0
this is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters ' , mr @entity48 told @entity21			0
it follows after ' ginger ' jihadist @entity58 disappeared from his @entity60 home in @entity8 's south - west in june and made his way to the @entity6			1

this comes just days ahead of the @entity74 summit to be held in @entity75 , which will be attended by a large number of world leaders			0
police commissioner @entity26 also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently , so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects			2
authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised many foreign fighters have already left the country including @entity89 ( pictured ) ' but the fact is there ’s still people travelling and regardless of what we ’re doing , we ’re not stopping that so we need some other tools , ' he said , according to @entity21			1
