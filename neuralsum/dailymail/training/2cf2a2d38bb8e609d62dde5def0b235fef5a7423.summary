’ thousands of women trying for a baby through @entity4 are being given unnecessary and expensive procedures to examine the womb , doctors have warned there has been a long - running debate over whether to perform hysteroscopies on women who have failed to get pregnant after one or more ivf attempts			1
the procedure – often under general anaesthetic – uses a narrow tube with a camera at the end to send images to a computer , where they can be checked for problems such as scar tissue that may cause infertility			1
if any abnormal growths are detected they are subsequently removed using a repeat procedure			0
in a trial involving eight fertility centres in @entity52 , 700 women who had suffered an unsuccessful round of @entity4 treatment were randomly assigned either a hysteroscopy before a second attempt , or put straight through for @entity4 again			0
abnormalities of the womb were found in one in 10 women having the procedure			2
but using the procedure and treating such problems made no significant difference to a woman ’s chances of going on to have a baby , the researchers found			2
