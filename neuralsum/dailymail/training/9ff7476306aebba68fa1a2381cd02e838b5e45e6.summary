by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 16:10 est , 14 august 2013 ouch : binge drinking costs more than just a hangover			0
the @entity3 says it costs more than $ 223.5billion a year a shocking new government study claims that excessive drinking costs the nation more than $ 223.5billion a year in health care , lost productivity , crime and early death - and most of the burden is carried by taxpayers			1
the research , released tuesday by the @entity3 , finds that binge drinking , alcoholism and alcohol abuse is dragging millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars from the economies of every state in the country			2
the health and productivity losses mean that for every cocktail , pint of beer or glass of wine consumed , @entity24 society must pay nearly $ 2 in additional costs			1
the nation 's capital , which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country according to @entity3 figures , pays the most			1
@entity39 residents consumed more than 680 drinks each in 2006 - the year that the study surveyed			0
those drinks cost out more than $ 966billion in ancillary healthcare bills and productivity losses as a result - more than $ 1,660 per resident of the city			1
@entity47 , where strong influence from the @entity50 church means alcohol is heavily regulated , has the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and - as a result - the lowest costs			1
@entity47 residents consumed fewer than 200 drinks each in 2006 and paid just $ 578 per capita			0
the shocking figure of $ 223.5billion is larger than the economies of @entity60 and @entity61			0
researchers say it should serve as a wake - up call that the country needs to curb its drinking habit			0
' excessive alcohol use has devastating impacts on individuals , families , communities , and the economy , ' @entity3 director dr @entity67 said in a statement			1
' in addition to injury , illness , disease , and death , it costs our society billions of dollars through reduced work productivity , increased criminal justice expenses , and higher healthcare costs			0
' effective prevention programs can support people in making wise choices about drinking alcohol			0
' about 42 percent of the cost of heavy drinking was paid by state or federal funds - whether through @entity94 or by other government services			0
that amounted to the largest share of the cost - and less than the cost paid by heavy drinkers and their families			0
some 70percent of the costs of excessive alcohol use was incurred by binge drinkers - those who consume five or more drinks in a single sitting			2
binge drinkers account for an estimated 70percent of the cost of alcohol abuse in @entity24 , the @entity3 study found authors of the study cautioned that the data does n't include drinkers whose productivity at work is hampered by hangovers			1
a @entity120 analysis of @entity3 data shows that @entity122 had the highest rates of alcohol consumption , with 736 drinks purchased per capita in 2006			1
@entity39 , and @entity126 were the next highest			2
however , the @entity3 points out that in @entity122 many of the package liquor buyers come from other states and in @entity126 - home to @entity131 - much of the state 's alcohol consumption can be attributed to tourists			1
the lowest per capita alcohol consumption was in @entity47 , @entity136 and @entity137			2
the study will be published in the october issue of the @entity140 of @entity141 .			0
