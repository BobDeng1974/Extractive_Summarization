a house next door has already partly collapsed into the sea and been condemned following two massive landslips in a year			1

indeed it ’s possible a shrewd buyer could get a return on their investment if @entity82 is kind to them			0
' the home was on the market for £ 365,000 in november 2011 and should now be worth around £ 400,000 - but the price tag is n’t the only thing that has plummeted			1
