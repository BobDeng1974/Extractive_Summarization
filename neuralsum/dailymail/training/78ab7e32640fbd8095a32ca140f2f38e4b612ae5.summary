by @entity0 a boy was diagnosed with leukaemia during a visit to his optician after four doctors missed the symptoms in the space of two weeks			1
@entity8 , 13 , was repeatedly taken to doctors at the beginning of 2012 after his parents became worried he was uncharacteristically breathless , lethargic and suffering temperature spikes			1
doctors kept telling his mother @entity13 there was nothing wrong with him , and one even carried out tests			1
blink of an eye : @entity8 , 13 , was turned away from doctors four times before his optician found a bleeding in his eye and prompted tests for leukaemia it was not until @entity8 complained that he was seeing everything with a pink tint that mrs @entity28 , 47 , booked an appointment with an optician in her home town of @entity32 , @entity33			1
optometrist @entity34 found that @entity8 had a large haemorrhage and oedema ( a build - up of fluid ) on his left eye			1
mrs @entity28 said : ‘ as soon as i told the optician what @entity8 ' symptoms were they said i must bring him down straight away			1
’ she told how the optometrist immediately referred @entity8 to @entity44 , in @entity45 , where the consultant confirmed the bleed and sent the young boy onto a paediatric ward			2
diagnosis : the circled areas who the areas of the eye that caused concern when @entity8 saw the optician there he was told he was suffering from a form of leukaemia and would need to be admitted to the @entity60 in @entity61			1
mrs @entity28 said : ‘ as soon as that doctor said something was not right i was singing hallelujah - i knew all along that something was n't right and it had been so stressful to be told over and over that he was fine			2
‘ as a mother you instinctively know when your child has something seriously wrong with them			0
‘ all his life @entity8 had been so hyperactive ; he was bouncing off the walls most of the time so we were worried about him when he suddenly changed and was out of breath , tired and getting temperature spikes			1
’ ‘ i was n't prepared to just accept the doctors ' word that @entity8 was fine			1
and it 's lucky that i did keep pushing for an answer - because the earlier you find the cancer the better the chance of survival , ’ mrs @entity28 added			0
@entity8 underwent a number of tests at the @entity60 and was eventually diagnosed with @entity87 positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - a rare illness in children			1
cancer : @entity8 ' parents watched their son go from ' bouncing off the walls ' to becoming lethargic and breathless and were rightly convinced something was wrong mrs @entity28 said : ‘ when @entity8 got his diagnosis it was a huge shock for the family , but thanks to @entity34 we were able to catch the leukaemia in the early stages so were stayed positive			1
’ as part of @entity8 ' two - year treatment , which included normal chemotherapy , he became the first child in the @entity105 to trial the drug @entity107 - which only became available for trial on children immediately after diagnosis			2
even though @entity8 was the first child in the country to take the drug , his parents did n't spend much time worrying about the drug - instead focusing on the improved survival rate from 55 per cent to 85 per cent			2
mrs @entity28 said : ‘ not much was known about the drug at the time , but we were advised that it would improve @entity8 ' chance of survival so did n't think twice about it			0
’ @entity122 is the paediatric haematology consultant at @entity123			0
she said : ‘ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of leukaemia , but @entity87 positive only accounts for three to five per cent of child cases			0
‘ it means the leukaemia is more difficult to treat than normal			0
’ happy ending : @entity8 , pictured at @entity130 during his treatment , is now in remission but after successful treatment @entity8 ’ mother , his father @entity134 and younger sister @entity135 , seven can look positively to the future			2
‘ things are going well and he is classed as in remission now			0
he could relapse but we are carrying on with his treatment			0
it will be five years before he can be classed as in full remission			0
‘ our experience really has opened my eyes to how important it is to make sure your children see an optician regularly - i did n't realise the kinds of conditions that they can pick up			0
‘ it 's not an exaggeration to say that @entity34 saved my sons life			0
‘ @entity34 is definitely on a pedestal - he 's a proper hero			0
’ @entity8 and his family have been supported by the charity when @entity157 , which aims to grant the wishes and special vip treats to children suffering from life threatening illnesses .			2
