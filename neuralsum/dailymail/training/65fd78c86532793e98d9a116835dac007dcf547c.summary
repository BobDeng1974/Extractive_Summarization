outside the simple apartment building where the @entity3 are staying , the team 's warm - up bibs are hanging out on a fence to dry			1
inside , a kit man is ironing @entity7 badges onto the sleeves of each shirt			0
it is a long way from the fancy hotels and perfect preparation of the @entity13			0
but upstairs one of the top flight 's rising stars is doing his best to cope with the testing conditions of @entity18 , a tiny jungle town in north eastern @entity20			1
' when we came , there was no tv and only cold water , ' says @entity25 , the @entity26 winger who is fast making a name for himself as one of @entity30 's finest players			1
@entity25 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity33 's @entity32 in the @entity35 game in @entity18 ' the internet was n't set up until two hours later , and there 's never enough food			1
they have to serve us at the buffet , otherwise they 'd run out before the staff have eaten , and the portions are tiny			0
i 'm getting up in the morning crazy hungry			0
' it could have been worse			0
several teams have had to move hotels amid the hastily planned tournament , and monday 's opponents @entity50 arrived at their base to find no electricity , running water , soap , bed sheets or towels			1
the @entity3 face @entity50 on monday at the @entity58 ' i guess we were n't that bad off then , ' laughs @entity25			1
' because i thought we were having a terrible time until i heard the other stories			0
' @entity18 is about as far as you can imagine from where @entity25 hopes to end up – at the pinnacle of @entity66 football			1
' it 's any player 's dream to play in the @entity69 , ' he says			2
' i think it 's normal , and for myself i want to be at that level			2
if i get a chance to take the step up , i 'd like to			0
' that might ring alarm bells for @entity26 fans and their new manager @entity77 , but with the form @entity25 is showing it can only be a matter of time before one of the big boys come knocking , especially if his game continues to develop at its current rate			1
a @entity3 fan cheers for @entity25 and co in @entity18 against @entity87 it is only six years since the @entity3 star was playing for @entity90 in @entity91 , a chance he took because it meant the opportunity to play full time			1
from there he turned down a contract at @entity97 to sign for @entity98 , going out on loan twice before moving to @entity100 , and then on to @entity26			1
' the journey has made me stronger as a person and a footballer , because i did n't have it all my way , ' he explains			0
' i had to go out on loan to the @entity107 , @entity108 , then come back and play			2
then we got relegated , so i had to play in @entity110 to try and get back in the @entity111			0
' just when he was starting to make a name for himself two years ago , the @entity7 came around , leaving the winger a difficult decision – stay and keep up the momentum , or represent the country of his parents ' birth			2
in the end he chose the former , helping @entity26 win promotion			2
@entity3 's goalkeeper @entity124 poses in front of his teammates the timing is less than perfect this time around too			1
three weeks ago , @entity25 's fiancé gave birth to their second child , just before the player had to leave for the tournament			1
' it 's been very hard , ' he admits			2
' i 'm going to go back and she might not even know me			0
' on top of the personal upheaval , it 's also not an ideal time to leave for footballing reasons , with a new manager in place			0
' he 's a top manager , ' says @entity25 of @entity77			1
' he 's not come from being sacked , he 's come from another team			0
i think he 's been aware of me for a while because his assistant at @entity148 , @entity149 , worked with me at @entity98			0
' but after three wins in @entity77 's first three games , @entity25 admits his team - mates have been messaging him suggesting he might struggle to get back in the team			1
@entity26 have enjoyed a recent rejuvenation in form since @entity77 returned to the club ' it 's going to be interesting , ' he laughs			1
' i guess , when everyone 's doing well , that 's when you leave it to the manager			0
' such is @entity25 's form , both at home and here in @entity30 , that dropping him seems a remote possibility			1
@entity3 's left winger was undisputedly the man of the match in the first game against @entity33 , and despite a disappointing performance against @entity87 , is unquestionably his side 's star man , and their only goalscorer so far in @entity20			1
the curling effort from the edge of the box on monday took his international goals this season ahead of his club tally , and it 's something the player knows he has to work on			2
' the only thing people are saying right now is that i do n't score enough goals			0
but i 'm pretty confident that 's going to come , and when it comes it 's going to be really interesting			0
' things could have been very different for @entity25 , who was eligible to play for both @entity187 and @entity188 , but instead picked @entity3 two years ago			1
had he waited , his domestic form this season might well have led to a call up from @entity192			0
@entity25 took inspiration from @entity195 's ( left ) international call up to the @entity187 squad ' @entity187 are like that , ' he reflects			1
' i think there 's a lot of people that get called up			0
' ' at the time i remember @entity195 [ @entity202 ] getting called for the @entity187 team , and i did think it could be possible			0
but i thought , ' i can do something for @entity3 , something a bit special			2
' that special something could be achieved in the next few weeks			0
the @entity209 have n't won a @entity7 since 1974 , but a win against @entity50 on monday night would take them into the knock - out stages , and they have a squad capable of progressing further			1
' getting out of the group was always the target , ' says @entity25			2
' then anything can happen			0
the way the tournament 's looking , it 's really tight , anyone can go through , and if some of the bigger teams do n't qualify then anyone can win it			0
' if @entity25 can lead his team to victory , he will confirm his status as a new legend of @entity229 football			2
@entity25 's teammates have joked that he will struggle to get back into the team following @entity77 's arrival			1
