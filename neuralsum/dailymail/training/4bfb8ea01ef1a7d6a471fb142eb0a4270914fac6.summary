they are two of the most ambitious firms in the hi - tech space - and could combine to put the internet in orbit and accessible to everyone			1
@entity6 is set to invest in @entity8 's plan to launch a constellation of satellites in space			1
the firm is already developing its own hi - altitude balloons to deliver access to remote areas			2
small satellite manufacturers : @entity29 and @entity31 's @entity30 are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record			0
according to the information the deal would help @entity36 develop satellites that could beam low - cost internet around the globe to billions who do n’t have it			1
' the price and terms @entity6 and @entity36 are discussing could n’t be learned although one person familiar with them said @entity6 has agreed to value @entity36 north of $ 10 billion and that the size of the total round , which includes other investors , is very large , ' the site said			1
@entity6 was believed to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online			1
@entity6 is tipped to spend $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones			2
@entity6 's @entity59 aims to launch high - altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below			1
the helium - filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft ( 15 metres ) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3g - speed internet to remote regions			1
in april , the company also acquired @entity70 , which is building solar - powered drones to provide similar connectivity			0
the news comes days after @entity36 founder @entity8 said he has set his sights on bringing it to space too			1
the entrepreneur says he wants to build a second internet in space , which could one day be used to enable any people living in colonies on @entity20 to get online			1
there is currently no name for the ambitious space venture , but it could speed up internet services on @entity86 too			2
mr @entity8 told @entity88 's @entity87 , that his aim is to create ' a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date			2
' earlier this month , he said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on @entity20 , later this year			2
he said : ' it will be important for @entity20 to have a global communications network as well			2
i think this needs to be done , and i do n't see anyone else doing it			0
' mr @entity8 's project would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles ( 1,207km ) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles ( 35,406 km )			0
a stock image is shown the project could cost $ 10 billion ( £ 7 billion ) and $ 15 billion ( £ 10 billion ) , mr @entity8 revealed in a @entity107 , adding that any revenues would be used to fund a colony on the red planet			0
it would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles ( 1,207km ) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles ( 35,406 km )			0
at the moment , internet data packets travelling from @entity116 to @entity117 , for example , have to pass through numerous routers and different networks , whereas mr @entity8 plans to route packs via space satellites instead			0
this would make services faster and potentially cheaper too			0
the project will be run from @entity36 's @entity126 office , whose employees will also work on the firm 's @entity130 rockets , for example			1
the ultimate goal is provide high - speed internet to the three billion people who have poor or no access to the web			1
it 's thought it will take at least five years to produce and launch the first generation of satellites and the project could take over 15 years to work how mr @entity8 envisions , the @entity138 reported			0
the race is on to connect remote parts of the world , with both @entity6 and @entity144 also investing in technologies such as balloons and drones			1
earlier this month , mr @entity8 said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on @entity20 , later this year			0
an image of @entity152 's proposed colony on the red planet is pictured			0
he said : ' it will be important for @entity20 to have a global communications network as well '			0

plan builds on @entity36 founder 's aim to connect remote parts of the world
@entity162 said a space internet could one day be used to enable any people living on @entity20 to get online - although this is in the far *future*
@entity6 *mulling* ' very large ' investment in project
