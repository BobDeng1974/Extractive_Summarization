a pledge by @entity1 to maintain @entity3 ’s controversial public spending formula was yesterday branded by conservative mps as a ‘ last - minute bribe ’			1
senior @entity6 warned the prime minister faces a ‘ deferred bloodbath ’ over the inducements offered to the @entity3 to persuade them to stay in the @entity11			1
yesterday , mr @entity1 , @entity12 and @entity13 signed up to a ‘ vow ’ to the people of @entity3 , including a guarantee to continue the @entity18 allocation – which sees the @entity3 get more than £ 1,300 per head in public spending above the @entity11 average			1
the party leaders said the @entity11 ‘ exists to ensure opportunity and security for all by sharing our resources equitably across all four nations ’			1
mr @entity1 used to argue that the formula was ‘ coming to the end of its life ’ , but retreated from that position last year after talks with mr @entity42			1
the @entity18 formula was devised as a way of adjusting block grants to @entity3 , @entity46 and @entity47 to spend on devolved policy areas , based on population			1
nationalists insist there are good reasons why @entity3 receives more spending per head than the @entity11 average , such as the difficulty of providing services in remote areas			1
but lord @entity18 said it was ‘ a subterfuge of a formula ’			2
asked in an interview with @entity64 ’s @entity63 if he thought it should be axed altogether , the 91 - year - old @entity61 said : ‘ i do now			0
’ he said he would call a debate in the @entity67 next month and try to force a vote on the issue			0
lord @entity18 added that he had intended the formula to be used for a year or two , but it has now been 35 years			2
unrest is already mounting at @entity72 over the leaders ’ pledge to agree an ‘ extensive ’ package of new powers for @entity77 , including control of tax and welfare , within six weeks after a no vote			2
the boss of one of the biggest pollsters last night admitted that his industry may have got the referendum result completely wrong			0
@entity87 , director of @entity88 , said the vote could be a ‘ polling @entity92 ’ if companies fail to predict the outcome			0
recent forecasts suggest the result is on a knife edge			0
but mr @entity87 said there was a ‘ real danger ’ to polling accuracy as data may have been corrupted			0
results could be skewed by a surge in @entity104 votes among people who do not normally vote , because they are often below the radar of pollsters			0
on the other hand , ‘ shy no ’ supporters afraid of being accused of lacking patriotism may decline to tell surveyors how they plan to vote , he added			0
the situation recalls memories of the 1992 election , when polling firms predicted a knife - edge victory for @entity117 – but @entity118 won by a slim overall majority			0
mr @entity87 told @entity64 that the actual referendum result could see a much more comfortable victory for either side			0
‘ i think and hope that the best that we in the industry can hope for is that we dodge a bullet , ’ he said			0
there is particular anger that @entity129 appears to be dictating the terms of commitments from the three parties			0
mr @entity1 has ruled out an @entity134 parliament , but said the need to rein in the right of @entity3 mps to vote on matters no longer affecting their constituents – the so - called @entity140 – was becoming ‘ pressing ’			2
today ’s @entity142 poll for the @entity143 finds that even @entity3 believe the present system is unfair and that their mps ’ influence should be reduced as @entity147 becomes more powerful			1
it finds that , in the event of more powers being devolved to the @entity147 , 58 per cent of @entity3 think their mps should not still be able to vote on laws which only affect the rest of the @entity11 – with just 21 per cent backing the status quo			1
there are growing demands from @entity157 mps for a ‘ grand committee ’ of @entity134 @entity146 at @entity72 , which would determine @entity134 - only affairs			2
‘ what price the union ? ’ said one senior conservative mp angered by the last - ditch offers to the @entity3			1
‘ and why is @entity129 the tail - wagging @entity72 dog ? ‘ nobody wants to cause trouble ahead of the referendum but these panicked offers mean @entity42 has won whatever the result			1
’ @entity157 mp @entity178 said : ‘ i do n’t see why people in the @entity180 should be worse off to the tune of thousands of pounds than the people of @entity3 … we ’ve always thought it was unfair , but now … it has to be dealt with			1
you ca n’t just give powers to @entity3 without a fairer distribution of funding and solving the @entity140			1
’ former minister @entity183 added : ‘ i ca n’t understand how they think they can deliver this without @entity147 looking at the whole @entity187 smacks of a last - minute bribe			2
the party leaders do n’t have the authority to make a bribe on behalf of the people of the @entity11			2
‘ taxation is an issue for @entity147 … we do n’t legislate by presidential - style decree			2
’ one @entity157 mp angered by the last - ditch offers asked : ' why is @entity129 the tail - wagging @entity72 dog ? ' ' these panicked offers mean @entity42 has won whatever the result , ’ said one angry @entity157 mp @entity129 last night attempted to rule out curbing the rights of @entity3 mps as part of a post-referendum deal			1
the former prime minister told @entity206 he does not think you can have ‘ two classes of mps at @entity72 ’			0
@entity210 , a former cabinet minister , said : ‘ if @entity3 is going to decide some tax rates as well as spending for itself , so should @entity134			2
’ @entity214 's analysis : the last - minute bribes being offered to stay in the @entity11 the ‘ vow ’ by @entity1 , @entity13 and @entity12 , in the left - wing @entity27 newspaper yesterday , amounts to @entity72 capitulating to demands made by the @entity3 left - wing establishment in recent years			1
yet , despite having huge constitutional and financial implications for everybody in the @entity11 , the three party leaders cooked them up behind closed doors without any proper debate – and with @entity129 at the fore			0
here , @entity228 editor @entity214 examines the ‘ bribes ’ which have been offered north of the border in a desperate attempt to sway tomorrow ’s referendum			0
a financial sweetener that perpetuates a system by which @entity3 gets £ 1,623 – 19 per cent – more expenditure per head than @entity134			1
the @entity18 formula , devised in the 1970s by then @entity61 chief secretary to the treasury @entity18 , was meant as a temporary measure to solve rows in the @entity242 government over how much money should be allocated to @entity3 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
desperate : the @entity104 vote has had a strong final push and almost all polls have the two sides neck and neck but politicians have repeatedly ducked the challenge of reforming it – mostly for fear of provoking a row with the @entity3			2
the decision is yet another u-turn by @entity1 who said in 2008 the formula ‘ can not last forever ’			0
the idea of resources shared ‘ equitably ’ will raise a hollow laugh across the rest of the @entity11 , given the capitulation over @entity18			1
unlike those living in @entity134 , @entity3 are already able to enjoy free social care for the elderly and free student tuition			0
@entity46 claims the decision to preserve @entity18 will leave the country £ 300million a year poorer than if money was allocated fairly			2
a counter to claims by @entity42 that the @entity271 is under threat from @entity72			1
the running of the health service north of the border is already the responsibility of @entity147			0
but new powers – expected to allow @entity147 to vary the income tax rate by at least 15p in the pound – would allow extra money to be raised for healthcare			2
with @entity3 in charge of every aspect of its own @entity271 , there is little or no justification for allowing @entity3 mps to continue to vote on the running of the @entity271 in @entity134			1
deal : @entity42 and @entity1 in 2012 signing the agreement which led to tomorrow 's referendum a statement seemingly tossed out without consideration of the constitutional implications			0
the @entity147 is the result of legislation enacted by @entity72 , which could be repealed			0
no @entity147 can bind its successor – yet the leaders are promising to do exactly that			0
experts say the only way to make @entity147 permanent would be to introduce the @entity11 ’s first ever written constitution – a task that could take @entity147 years to achieve			1
@entity1 , @entity13 and @entity12 have no agreement among their parties to give new powers to the @entity3 or change the constitution			1
the deal has been hatched behind closed doors , with @entity129 taking a lead role			0
mr @entity1 can expect a rebellion by @entity157 mps who want an @entity134 parliament in which @entity3 can not sway the vote on issues with no effect on their constituents			1
what is certain is that , in the event of a no vote , the last nine months of the current @entity147 will be dominated by the fallout			0
there is already resentment that the vow was made in a @entity3 newspaper , without any warning .			0

three main parties promise £ 1,300 more than average spent on every @entity330
it is part of @entity18 funding formula called ' grossly unfair ' by own founder
today @entity142 poll for the @entity143 finds even @entity3 think *disparity* is unjust
one @entity157 mp : ' panicked offers ' mean @entity42 has won either way
the @entity18 formula for the allocation of resources will continue
the @entity11 exists to ensure opportunity and security for all by sharing our resources equitably
the final say on how much is spent on the @entity271 will be a matter for the @entity147
the @entity147 is permanent
extensive new powers will be delivered to the @entity147 , starting on *september* 19
