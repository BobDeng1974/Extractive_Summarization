the 62 - year - old , who was at his mother ’s side when she died , said the couple ’s treatment had been grotesque and claimed they were put on the pathway without consultation			1
just two weeks before his death , mr @entity5 had celebrated his 90th birthday at a family party			1
‘ he was in a wheelchair and was in discomfort , but he was compos mentis and you could speak to him about anything , he was sharp , ’ his son said			1
son @entity46 said his parents were treated like ' animals who needed to be put down ' when his sister received a telephone call from the care home to tell her that their father , a former ambulance driver , had been put on sedatives , mr @entity50 did not think it meant he was seriously ill. as a result , the old soldier died without any of his family being present			1
mr @entity50 said : ‘ i would not have wanted my father to suffer if he had been riddled with cancer or his diabetes was killing him , or if he had made the decision to go			1
‘ i would have just liked to have been there with him			0
‘ but somebody else was making those decisions and not telling us			0

’ mr @entity50 claims that within days of his father ’s death , care home staff stopped giving his mother food or fluids and her health deteriorated rapidly			2
he said : ‘ they were telling me that she ’d forgotten how to eat and when i arrived there she was so frail			0
‘ i held her hand up to the light and could see the blood going through her veins , that ’s the state they got her into			0
we had a family friend there and i said , “ there ’s no way that my mother is refusing food and we have to get some fluids in there ”			2
‘ i went and bought a baby ’s feeding bottle and put some water into it and she just sucked it down			2
you just could n’t pull it out of her mouth			0
’ praise : health secretary @entity121 described the pathway as ' a fantastic step forward ' mr @entity50 claims the same gp who allowed his father to be put on the @entity3 authorised district nurses to put his mother on sedatives without his even having visited her			1
he added : ‘ it was a grotesque death			0
when i watched my mother die over those 33 hours she was so thin and dehydrated , it actually changed the shape of her head			2
‘ it ’s like taking your animals to the vet			0
i ’ve got dogs and they get old and you agree to put them down			2
it ’s no different to that , no different at all			0
’ @entity143 , practice manager at the @entity144 in @entity77 , where @entity50 and mrs @entity16 ’s doctor worked , said : ‘ we are sorry if anyone is unhappy with the care and advice provided			0

yet health secretary @entity121 has described the pathway as ‘ a fantastic step forward ’ – and dismissed concerns as based on matters ‘ going wrong in one or two cases ’			2
‘ it ’s basically designed to bring hospice - style care to terminally ill people in hospitals , ’ he said			0
