by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 07:14 est , 8 may 2012 fears are growing that @entity4 's thwarted underpants bomb plot is just one of a number of terrorist plans to bring down aeroplanes			1
a senior law enforcement source said other devices , similar to the ' undetectable ' one discovered this month in @entity11 , could be ready to be deployed by other would - be bombers			2
he told the @entity13 : ' if they built one , they probably built more			0
that 's the scary part			0
' the startling admission comes as @entity18 counter-terrorism officials said they thought the mastermind of the latest underpants bomb plot was killed during a @entity22 drone attack in @entity11 on sunday			1
dear : was senior @entity4 leader @entity23 , killed on sunday by a drone strike , behind the updated underpants bomb plot @entity23 , one of @entity28 terrorists , wanted to bring down a @entity18 - bound jetliner with a new and improved ' undetectable ' version of the underwear bomb that failed to detonate aboard a jetliner over @entity33 in christmas 2009			1
the explosion was to be carried out , reports suggest , to mark the one year anniversary of the killing of @entity38			0
but the @entity11 - based terrorist was killed by a missile fired by an unmanned @entity22 drone as he stepped out of a vehicle in a remote valley in the south of @entity11			1
two counter-terrorism officials told the @entity46 they believed 37 - year - old @entity23 , who had a $ 5million bounty on his head , was the key militant behind the plans			1
new terror alert : @entity4 reportedly planned to strike on the first anniversary of @entity38 's death @entity23 was indicted in the @entity18 for his role in the 2000 bombing of the @entity58 in the harbour of @entity60 , @entity11 , in which 17 @entity18 sailors were killed and 39 injured			1
he was later believed to have replaced @entity61 as the @entity4 on the @entity63 's head of external operations when the latter was killed in a @entity18 airstrike last year			1
the @entity67 is now examining the latest bomb to see whether it could have passed through airport security and brought down an aeroplane			2
the device did not contain metal , meaning it probably could have passed through an airport metal detector			2
but it was not clear whether new body scanners used in many airports would have detected it			0
senator @entity78 , of @entity79 , who heads the @entity80 , said yesterday she had been briefed about an ' undetectable ' device that was ' going to be on a @entity18 - bound airliner			1
' there were no immediate plans to change security procedures at @entity18 airports			1
but there are reports , in the @entity18 media , that last week the plot led the @entity18 to order scores of air marshals to @entity93 to protect @entity18 - bound aircraft			1
flights out of @entity96 , in @entity97 , reportedly received 100 percent coverage , according to @entity18 sources			1
the would - be suicide bomber , based in @entity11 and believed to be working for @entity102 , had not yet picked a target or bought his plane tickets when the @entity22 stepped in and seized the bomb , officials said			1
@entity107 congressman @entity106 , chairman of the @entity108 , said counter-terrorism officials had said of the wannabe bomber : ' we do nâ€™t have to worry about him any more			0
' he is alive , officials added , but they would not give any further details			0
@entity115 spokeswoman @entity114 said president @entity116 learned about the plot in april and was assured the device posed no threat to the public			1
notified : the @entity115 said president @entity116 was told about the terror plot back in april , despite his administration 's claim over the last few weeks that there was no ' credible threat ' ' the president thanks all intelligence and counter-terrorism professionals involved for their outstanding work and for serving with the extraordinary skill and commitment that their enormous responsibilities demand , ' @entity114 said			1
the first : underwear bomber @entity135 , is pictured in his 2009 mugshot after his failed @entity138 bomb attempt the operation unfolded even as the @entity115 and @entity140 assured the @entity18 public that they knew of no @entity4 plots against the @entity18 around the anniversary of @entity38 's death			1
' we have no credible information that terrorist organisations , including @entity4 , are plotting attacks in the @entity18 to coincide with the anniversary of @entity38 's death , ' @entity115 press secretary @entity146 said on april 26			2
on may 1 , the @entity140 said , ' we have no indication of any specific , credible threats or plots against the @entity18 tied to the one - year anniversary of @entity38 's death			2
' the @entity0 learned about the thwarted plot last week but agreed to @entity115 and @entity22 requests not to publish it immediately because the sensitive intelligence operation was still under way			2
once officials said those concerns were allayed , the @entity0 decided to disclose the plot despite requests from the @entity116 administration to wait for an official announcement			1
the decision to delay the announcement has led to some speculation that @entity116 was ' electioneering '			1
but this has been dismissed by his camp			0
@entity18 officials , who were briefed on the operation , insisted on anonymity to discuss the case , which the @entity18 has never officially acknowledged			2
old bomb : pictured here is the slightly charred and singed underwear which housed the explosives used by @entity135 it 's not clear who built the bomb , but , because of its sophistication and its similarity to the @entity138 bomb , authorities suspected it was the work of master bomb maker @entity186			0
@entity188 constructed the first underwear bomb and two others that @entity4 built into printer cartridges and shipped to the @entity18 on cargo planes in 2010			2
suspect : authorities believe the updated underwear bomb was the work of master bomb maker @entity186 both of those bombs used a powerful industrial explosive			0
@entity188 , of @entity201 , was believed killed in a drone strike last year , but @entity11 officials quickly denied his death			1
the operation is an intelligence victory for the @entity18 and a reminder of @entity4 's ambitions , despite the death of @entity38 and other senior leaders			2
since the death of @entity38 in a daring @entity214 raid on his @entity216 compound , the terror group is believed to have shifted its interests from @entity218 to @entity11			0
the terror group has taken advantage of @entity11 's political turmoil in the past year , gaining territory and strength			0
it has set up terrorist camps and , in some areas , even operates as a de facto government			0
yesterday , @entity4 militants staged a surprise attack on a @entity11 army base in the south , killing 22 soldiers and capturing at least 25			0
the militants managed to reach the base both from the sea and by land , gunning down troops and making away with weapons and other military hardware after the blitz attack , @entity11 military officials said			0
but along with the gains there also have been losses			0
the group has suffered significant setbacks as the @entity22 and the @entity18 military focus more on @entity11			1
the new @entity11 president , @entity247 , has promised improved cooperation with the @entity18 to combat the militants			0
on saturday , he said the fight against @entity4 was in its early stages			0
@entity247 took over in february from longtime authoritarian leader @entity252			0
since the terror attacks on the morning of september 11 , 2001 , @entity4 has put different types of plans into action in numerous @entity258 plots			0
while none of the plots have been successful , they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures .			0
