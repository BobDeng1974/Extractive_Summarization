a 75 - year - old man has had a seven - inch turn signal removed from his arm after it became embedded during a horrific car crash - 51 years ago			1
former real estate agent @entity4 from @entity5 , @entity6 , slammed his @entity8 head - on into a truck as he was driving to a property viewing in 1963 - breaking his hip in the process			1
the father - of - three 's arm was only scratched on the surface and it was n't until he walked through a metal detector a decade ago that he discovered a piece of metal the size of a pencil was still in there			1
@entity4 from @entity5 , @entity6 , went under the knife at the @entity24 in @entity6 on @entity25 to remove a turn signal that was embedded in his arm during a car crash in 1963			1
his wife @entity28 was shocked when a doctor handed the object over to her in a waiting room mr @entity4 did not know he had the seven - inch metal object embedded in his arm until he walked through a metal detector a decade ago following an x-ray doctors said it could stay in his arm because it was n't causing any pain and had n't been infected			1
however , according to the @entity38 , when he was lifting concrete blocks for an apartment he is renovating , it started to hurt			0
he therefore went under the knife at the @entity24 in @entity38 on wednesday with his wife @entity28 at his side after a 45 - minute operation , dr. @entity45 walked into the waiting room and handed the metal object to @entity49 , to which she replied : ' @entity52			2
' she told the paper : ' my husband can do just about anything			0
he 's a pretty smart guy			0
' everything was fine until it started to get bigger			0
the arm started bulging , ' she added			2
dr @entity45 said : we see all kinds of foreign objects like nails or pellets , but usually not this large , usually not a turn signal from a 1963 @entity70 initially the married couple , who met on a blind date after the crash , thought the foreign object may have been a medical instrument unwittingly left in his arm during surgery following the crash			2
however when a friend showed them pictures of the mangled @entity8 , mr @entity4 realized that the indicator from the left side of the steering column was missing			1
mr @entity4 had never noticed the lever because he had suffered more severe injuries in the crash and his arm had healed over			2
mrs @entity88 , however , is now pleased that the mystery has been solved			0
she told the paper : ' you know what it 's like with a child			0
you know it 's in your womb , but it 's not until the miraculous birth occurs that you feel the reality of it			0
' when asked what he would do with the lever , mr @entity4 simply said : ' we 'll figure something out			0
' mr @entity4 broke his hip when his @entity8 hit the truck head on			1
the accident was perceived to be so bad that some of the local papers said it was fatal initially the @entity4 and @entity28 thought the foreign object could have been a medical instrument unwittingly left in their during surgery following the accident			0
but then they noticed that the left turn signal was missing the severity of the other injuries mr @entity4 suffered in the crash meant he did not feel the lever in his arm for decades			1
