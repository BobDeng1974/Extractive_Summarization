by @entity0 , deputy political editor chancellor @entity1 has only made 40 per cent of cuts so far , but stronger economic growth could spare some future cuts @entity6 has become overly dependent on tax revenues from the richest 1 per cent of workers and it would be a ‘ risk ’ to demand more from them , the @entity5 has warned			1
those whose salaries start at £ 150,000 now account for 27.5 per cent of all income tax paid , up from just 11 per cent in 1979			2
these contributions , from just 300,000 people , represent 7.5 per cent of total tax revenue – and the group also pay ‘ a large fraction of vat and capital taxes ’			0
shadow chancellor @entity22 has announced plans to soak the rich by raising the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £ 150,000			0
but the @entity5 says it is very difficult to assess how workers would behave if tax rates changed – hinting that wealthy individuals could avoid tax or move abroad if the 50p rate returns			1
the think - tank said : ‘ increased concentration of revenues from fewer individuals is significant and increases the sensitivity of the government ’s overall revenue position to the incomes and tax - payment behaviour of these individuals			2
’ the @entity5 also condemned @entity44 ’s plan to reintroduce the 10p tax rate for the low - paid , saying it would be ‘ less well - targeted ’ than the @entity49 government ’s increases to the threshold at which workers must pay basic - rate income tax			1
‘ it ’s hard to find a coherent rationale for it , ’ it added			0
last year , @entity55 pledged to reintroduce the 10 per cent rate abolished by @entity57 in 2007 – funded by a mansion tax on houses worth more than £ 2million			0
the @entity5 said this policy would cost £ 7billion – more than @entity44 has set aside – and introduce ‘ unnecessary complexity to the income tax system ’			1
the intervention is the third time in recent weeks that the @entity5 has questioned @entity44 ’s policies			1
mr @entity22 claimed raising the top rate of tax could raise an extra £ 15billion by 2020 , but the @entity5 said the best estimate was just £ 100million a year			1
how less than half of cuts have already been made the @entity5 poured cold water on @entity73 deputy prime minister @entity73 's call for further rises to £ 12,500 in the level at which workers start paying income tax			1
further significant increases in personal allowance would be ' expensive and poorly targeted at helping the low paid ' , as one in six workers now pay no income tax and would therefore not benefit			0
only 15 per cent of any further rises in the threshold level would go to workers in the bottom half of the earnings ladder , said the @entity5			1
but the thinktank was even less complimentary about @entity44 's proposal to restore the 10p starting rate of income tax , saying that it was ' hard to find a coherent economic rationale ' for the change			0
the plan would be ' if anything , less well targeted on the low paid and would add unnecessary complexity / the @entity22 has also pledged to run a surplus on day - to - day government spending by 2020 , in a bid to match @entity1 ’s vow to run a surplus on total spending by 2018			1
the @entity5 confirmed that this would allow mr @entity22 to spend or borrow up to £ 25billion a year more than the @entity105			1
the experts also warned the conservatives and @entity73 that lifting the basic - rate threshold above £ 10,000 will do little to help the poor because two million have already been lifted out of the income tax system since 2010 , as the personal allowance has been raised from £ 6,475 to £ 10,000			1
from april , the bottom 17 per cent of earners will pay no income tax at all			0
any further increase to the tax allowance would cost £ 12billion , the @entity5 said – and only 15 per cent of the gains would go towards the poorest half of workers			2
the think - tank said the employee national insurance contribution threshold should be raised above its current level of £ 7,956 instead			2
a @entity73 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity73 are nothing other than incredibly proud of the tax cuts we have delivered in @entity126 for ordinary people			2
' this policy is about making work pay			0
the @entity6 people have made great sacrifices as we repair the economy after the mess @entity44 left it in			0
‘ that is why the @entity73 are pushing for a further worker ’s bonus of a £ 100 tax cut at the next budget			0
people earning £ 12,500 or a little bit more , who will benefit most from this tax cut , do n’t regard themselves as rich and neither do we			0
’ a @entity145 spokesman added : ‘ as the @entity5 say in their report today , the @entity6 economy has gathered momentum and growth is now among the fastest in the developed world			1
‘ but , as they also say , the largest challenge for the chancellor remains having to contend with the consequences of the @entity156 for the public finances and household incomes			0
‘ that is why it ’s so important that we continue to work through the long - term plan that is delivering economic security for @entity6 ’s hardworking people			2

billions more will need to be found after the 2015 *general* *election*
@entity1 has vowed to balance the books by 2018 - 19
@entity5 warns growth does not *eliminate* need for cuts
*unprotected* *departments* will be slashed by 30 *%* from 2010 to meet target
