by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 look set to complete the signing of @entity4 left - back @entity3 in a £ 12million deal			1
if there was one thing they lacked last season it was an inability to get in behind stubborn defences ( remember that decisive defeat to @entity30 during the title run - in ) @entity3 will open teams up arriving from deeper			2
but he will be tested defensively and judging from tuesday night 's tears he 'll miss home			0
on the move ? @entity1 are on the brink of signing @entity3 ( left ) in a £ 12million transfer and he 's a full - back , but with a winger 's soul ? he is a full - back in the @entity43 sense of the word ( that ’s @entity45 2014 ‘ @entity43 ’ )			1
he flies forward @entity46 style and has been used as a wing back and even as a left - winger by @entity4 coach @entity50			1
his influence on the team was nowhere near as great but there are similarities with former @entity4 right - back @entity46 and now with @entity58 ’s other attacking full - back @entity56			1
cheerio : @entity3 's ( top ) move to @entity61 looks set after @entity3 pulled out of @entity4 's @entity63 final on tuesday is he highly - rated in @entity64 and if so why have the big two their not snapped him up ? @entity66 did take a look but their style is not usually to spend big on homegrown defenders when they can buy attacking players from abroad at three times the price			1
and @entity58 have @entity73 - who @entity3 will be competing with for a place in the @entity64 starting @entity75 if he progresses at @entity1			2
@entity76 capped him last season and rates him highly and @entity50 gave him his debut aged 19			0
if @entity50 and @entity76 rate him it ’s safe to say @entity1 have a player			0
no go : @entity3 was involved in @entity4 training on monday ahead of @entity84 final vs @entity66 will he handle the switch ? two years ago he was a @entity4 reserve player			1
in just two campaigns he has become a first team regular , been capped by @entity64 , and now earned a move to the @entity89			0
a lot has happened to him in a short space of time and there will be some adjusting needed			0
but he will not be alone on the @entity95			0
his former @entity64 under - 21 team - mate @entity96 will be just a short drive away			0
in @entity98 he will have a former @entity4 team - mate close - by too			2
@entity100 also speaks @entity101 as does his new coach @entity6			0
emotional exit : @entity4 's @entity3 was in tears after their @entity84 defeat to @entity66 so success or failure ? he is going to the right club			1
@entity6 wo n’t baulk at his forward forays , he ’ll encourage them			2
this is a player who had never played as a defender until three years ago when he converted from winger to full - back			1
but he has learned well under @entity4 ’s experienced full - back @entity116			1
that education will continue at @entity1 and so will the license to overlap			0
spectator : @entity3 watched the @entity84 final from the stands ahead of a @entity1 medical and he has the temperament to handle the pressure ? he will enjoy @entity61			1
he ’s a football fan who grew up watching the thrilling @entity4 side that won back to back @entity129 cups and two @entity101 cups six or seven years ago under @entity131			2
he stood on the stands of the @entity133 and cheered on @entity134 and company as a teenage fan			0
he ’ll respond in the right way to the big @entity139 nights @entity1 are hoping to have his season .			0

@entity3 looks set to complete a £ 12million move to @entity61 from @entity4
manager @entity6 hopes @entity3 can solve problem left - back role
the attacking left - back should allow them to be more *penetrative*
he flies forward @entity46 - style and has been used as a wing - back
