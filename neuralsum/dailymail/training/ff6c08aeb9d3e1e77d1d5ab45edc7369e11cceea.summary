after a century and a half of holding onto its secrets , the recently decoded diary of @entity2 officer @entity1 reveals he wrote his @entity7 diary in code to conceal juicy camp gossip			1
sprinkled amid entries on camp recipes and casualties are encrypted passages in which @entity1 dishes on such juicy topics as a fellow soldier who got caught in bed with another man 's wife			1
@entity1 also writes about meeting the wife of @entity2 president @entity22 and describes her looks in an apparent echo of rumors at the time that she may have been of mixed race			1
diary : @entity1 , an officer in the @entity2 army , kept a diary where he recorded recipes and lists of deserters , as well as gossip written in code ' that 's pretty shocking , ' said @entity37 , the @entity38 computer science professor and former @entity40 cryptographer who deciphered @entity1 's code with little difficulty			1
' it 's a military diary and you expect military information , but you do n't expect the first lady of the @entity2 to make an appearance in this diary , ' he said			2
according to @entity52 , @entity50 's encrypted entry about @entity51 describes her as ' dark complected ' with ' very very brown skin dark eyes ' and ' high cheek bones wide mouth			2
' @entity22 ' wife was a well - educated woman for her time , and as a result , was the target of ' all kind of gossipy innuendos from the ladies ' in @entity65 , @entity66 , the @entity2 capital , according to @entity67 of the @entity68 in @entity65			1
@entity1 , a lieutenant with the 6th @entity69 , was severely wounded in the arm at the @entity71 in 1863			1
assigned to light duty behind the lines , he used a leather - bound pocket diary to jot down his thoughts and even a poem			1
simplicity : @entity78 , a former cryptologist for the @entity40 , said the code is not difficult to break , with symbols substituted for letters of the alphabet secrets : the diary was likely acquired by a soldier from @entity86 and wound up in the state 's collections , before a volunteer discovered the code president : @entity22 was the first and only president of the @entity2 , whose wife was rumored at the time to be of mixed race because of her darker skin and dark eyes many of the entries were in a code he devised himself , consisting of a variety of symbols , including punctuation marks and a dollar sign , that corresponded to letters of the alphabet			1
other entries — names of deserters , costs of supplies — were written in plain text			2
this was because the diary would have been submitted to his superiors so they could copy the information for their records , says @entity119 , librarian at the @entity120			0
@entity119 said the journal probably came into the possession of a @entity86 soldier at the end of the war and wound up in the state 's vast collection			0
it is the only @entity2 diary in the museum			0
there is no record there of @entity1 's ultimate fate			0
it was n't until 2012 that a museum volunteer discovered the diary was written partly in code			0
the museum contacted @entity52 , who had broken @entity141 and @entity2 codes used in other documents , and he completed the deciphering after working on it for a week in january			2
' technically , this is not very hard to break , ' @entity37 said			0
' there were some odd things			0
with a little bit of work and patience everything worked out			0

@entity1 began writing in a leather - bound journal after being severely wounded at the @entity71
in between plain - text entries he recorded gossip , including an entry about @entity2 president @entity22 's wife , written in code
he devised his code himself out of a series of symbols that corresponded to letters of the alphabet
the code was broken by @entity52 , @entity38 computer science professor and former @entity40 cryptographer
