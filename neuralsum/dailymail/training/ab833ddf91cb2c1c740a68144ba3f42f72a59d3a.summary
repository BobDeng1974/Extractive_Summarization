the @entity2 protestors ’ attack on the @entity5 @entity4 studio during the opening game was frightening enough for those in the booth to believe they were being shot at			1
the windows of the studio bridging the road along the @entity13 were said to be broken by ball - bearings fired from a catapult but they made a similar sound to gunfire to the @entity5 team , which included presenter @entity19 and pundits @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
to add to their understandable concern there were reports of a body lying on the road underneath			2
this later turned out to be the victim of a traffic accident who had been hit by a bus			0
no change : the glass was still shattered behind @entity5 pundit @entity37 in the studio on friday frightening : the presenters ' thought they were getting shot at ' during the @entity4 opener on thursday an @entity5 insider said : ‘ everyone inside the studio stayed very cool but you can image the concern of their friends and family watching back home			1
’ @entity5 have demanded that security is increased and , in the circumstances , their ‘ curse ’ striking again with their heavily - publicised @entity53 crashing just as @entity54 was about to score @entity56 ’s second goal was regarded as less of a priority			1
@entity62 , in charge of the elite referees in the @entity61 , was one of the 13 - strong @entity64 referee assessment panel responsible for choosing @entity66 official @entity65 to take charge of the opening game , in which he awarded the softest of penalties to @entity56			1
@entity64 insiders say that @entity65 , whose weak performance was heavily criticised by defeated @entity73 , was chosen because he represents a different confederation from the teams involved and had a good @entity4 in 2010			1
controversial : referee @entity65 was heavily criticised after his performance in the @entity56 vs @entity73 game almost the entire 70 - plus membership of the @entity81 party at the @entity4 gathered in the dining room at their @entity83 in @entity85 to watch the opening game of the tournament			1
however , it ’s safe to assume that the bets were n’t flying around like in the old days — especially in @entity90 when @entity91 ( right ) was the bookmaker			0
at last @entity92 ’s on side @entity95 ’s proposal at the @entity96 for managers to appeal against decisions during games might not be as left - field as first thought			1
sports technology leaders @entity102 are already testing immediate offside decision - making in the @entity104			2
meanwhile , the unnecessary goalline technology ( @entity107 ) replay of @entity110 @entity109 ’s own goal , when the ball was obviously way over the line , is understood to have been screened by the host broadcasters because of an agreement to show @entity107 in action during a game , irrespective of it being needed			2
the @entity110 - themed @entity96 opening entertainment included a surprise appearance by a @entity120 singer			2
surely that was n’t connected with @entity95 ’s naked ambition to win a @entity124 peace prize , having brokered talks between the @entity127 and @entity128 football federations ? in the clear ? @entity95 is introducing automatic offside detecting technology in @entity130 conspicuous by his absence from the @entity96 and the opening match was football icon @entity134 , who is @entity110 president @entity136 ’s ambassador for the tournament			0
it seems that @entity134 has yet to settle his differences with the @entity110 football federation after he fell out with the disgraced former overlord @entity141 , who is mired in corruption scandals			0
it wo n’t be on the scale of the @entity110 protests that are in danger of overshadowing the @entity4 but military personnel will be demonstrating outside @entity150 ’s @entity149 headquarters at noon on next saturday			0
this follows the radio station ’s failure to respond to the serious upset caused by their pundit @entity156 ’s offensive tweet about the @entity158			0
one of the more bizarre sights in @entity85 , gateway to the @entity162 rainforest , is a fully grown jaguar , one of the big beasts of the nearby jungle , sadly enclosed in a relatively small cage as the showcase exhibit of the zoo in the @entity170			0
it ’s claimed the @entity110 @entity172 has approved all the enclosures .			0
