by @entity0 last updated at 12:50 pm on 25th january 2012 signed off : @entity2 mayor @entity1 has approved a law forcing porn stars to wear condoms while filming in the city a controversial new law forcing porn stars to wear condoms during film shoots in @entity2 will come into effect in the next six weeks after being rubber - stamped by the city 's mayor			1
the law , signed on monday by mayor @entity1 , will come into force 41 days after it is posted by the city clerk , expected to happen as early as this week			1
officials with the @entity19 , which lobbied for years for such a law , expressed jubilation yesterday and said they would now turn their attention to getting a similar condom requirement adopted elsewhere			1
@entity24 , president of the @entity19 , which had pushed the measure for six years , said : ' the city of @entity2 has done the right thing			1
they 've done the right thing for the performers			1
' but critics claim the regulation jeopardises the long - term future of the industry in the nation 's porn capital as many firms have threatened to abandon the area			1
mr @entity24 said its adoption is crucial in protecting adult film actors from @entity41 and other sexually transmitted diseases			0
@entity24 said his group 's next move will be to get @entity45 to adopt a similar measure for its unincorporated areas			0
the group is in the midst of a petition drive to put the issue on the ballot , but @entity24 said he hopes the county 's board of supervisors will react as the @entity55 did and pass such an ordinance itself			0
the council gave its final approval last week			0
@entity60 ? industry bosses have threatened to leave the city over the condom law , but proponents want to encourage similar legislation elsewhere in @entity66 industry officials estimate as many as 90 per cent of the porn films produced in the @entity66 are made in @entity2			1
most are filmed quietly in the city 's suburban @entity69			0
legendary porn king @entity71 believes viewers would be put off by condoms because they ' ruin the fantasy ' and said many customers would simply seek out overseas imports which often do n't use protection			1
the 58 - year - old claims the current method of carrying out @entity80 testing on actors every 30 days was a sufficient safeguard against @entity41			1
critic : legendary porn actor @entity71 ( above ) claims the use of condoms would ' ruin the fantasy ' for viewers but fellow veteran actor @entity89 welcomed the new law as a means of giving further protection to workers			1
' i ’m happy he ( the mayor ) signed it , ' mr @entity89 told the @entity96			1
' we ’re just trying to protect people ’s lives			0
we ’re still human beings even though we chose to be in this business			0
' according to the @entity96 , mr @entity89 , 47 , was the focus of an @entity41 outbreak which closed production in the area for a month in 2004 when he unwittingly spread the disease to three actresses after testing negative just a few days earlier			0
after the council 's action , several of the industry 's biggest filmmakers said they might consider moving just outside the county			2
that prompted @entity115 mayor @entity114 to announce last week that he would ask the city attorney for his community , located just across the county line from the @entity69 , to write a similar ordinance			2
@entity24 said tuesday his group would also be vigilant in keeping track of where porn producers might go			2
exactly how the law will be enforced is still to be determined			2
it calls for makers of porn films to pay a fee , the amount still to be determined , that would be used to pay for spot checks at filming locations			2
health risk : it is hoped the new legislation will safeguard against stds in the industry , but opponents believe the current method of testing every 30 days is sufficient the @entity55 is creating a committee to determine the amount of the fee and who would make the spot checks			1
@entity24 said he envisions enforcement would fall on nurses or other public health providers			0
' it is not anticipated , based on what we desire or what has been discussed , that it would be uniformed police officers , ' he said			0
@entity24 said he would be open to working with industry leaders to enforce the law			1
he noted the ordinance does not require condoms when oral sex is involved because his group , which originally crafted it , agreed with the filmmakers that infection through oral sex was not as great as through other sex acts			0
the industry already requires that actors be tested for @entity41 every 30 days , and filmmakers say they believe that is sufficient			2
' it 's not that i do n't doubt the sincerity of their desire to protect the talent			0
and believe it or not , we have the same ambition , ' @entity174 , general manager of @entity175 , said last week after the council 's vote			0
' we just do n't believe their way is the best way , ' added @entity174 , who is also on the board of directors of the industry trade group the @entity184 .			0
