as this image gets larger , what do you see ? most people will pick out a phantom - like picture of @entity5			1
but if you see a @entity7 pin - up , you may need a trip to the opticians			0
at normal viewing distance , healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on @entity5 's face , causing the brain to disregard @entity16 's image altogether			1
features with a high spatial frequency ( @entity5 ) are only visible when you 're viewing them close up , and those with low spatial frequencies ( @entity16 ) are only visible from further away			1
combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen			1
this classic optical illusion was created several years ago by neuroscientists at the @entity32			2
in a recent video , @entity33 highlighted the process behind the trick , which can also be seen in a still image by anyone if they move closer and then farther away from the screen			1
‘ depending on how well you ’re able to focus or pick up contrast your eye will only pick out details , ’ the video explains			1
‘ up close , we ’re generally able to pick up fine details like @entity5 ’s moustache and wrinkles			2
‘ but as the distance increases , or if your vision is poor and creates a more blurred image in the first place , your ability to pick up details fades away			1
‘ instead you only see general features , like the shape of mouth , nose and hair , and are left seeing @entity16			2
‘ the @entity32 team , led by dr @entity59 , has spent over a decade creating hybrid optical illusions that show how images can be hidden with textures , words and other objects			0
when you look at the image above , whose face do you see ? at normal screen viewing distance you should see the face of @entity5			1
squint your eyes or take a few steps back from the image and @entity16 should come into view ' @entity74 ' was created by superimposing a blurry picture of @entity16 over a picture of @entity5 drawn in fine lines			1
features with a high spatial frequency are only visible when viewing them close up , and those with low spatial frequencies are only visible at a distance			1
combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen			2
dr @entity87 ’s group say these images not only reveal vision problems , but can also highlight how the brain processes information			0
in one study , participants were shown hybrid images for just of 30 milliseconds , and only recognised the low spatial resolution , or blurry , component of the image			2
on the top row , up close , you can see that the man on the left is scowling , while the woman on the right has a placid facial emotion			0
move back , and the faces change expressions and even genders			0
if you squint , blink or defocus , the angry man turns calm , and the calm woman turns angry , and male at normal viewing distance , you may see a dolphin			1
but disguised within the low spatial frequency of this hybrid is a car , which you will see once you step back a few metres but when the images were shown for 150 milliseconds , they only recognised the image that was produced in fine detail , or in high spatial resolution			2
in a separate test , they were shown sad faces in high spatial resolution and angry faces in low spatial resolution			0
they superimposed pictures used both male and female faces			0
when displayed for 50 milliseconds , participants always saw an angry face , but were unable to pinpoint the sex of the person pictured			0
dr @entity87 says this shows that our brains discriminate between picking out fine detail in some situations , and broader detail in others			0
the brain ’s processing of fine details happens slightly later than processing other features , according to the research			0
the teams believes hybrid images such as this may prove useful to advertisers who want to change how their logos appear at different distances			0
it could also be used to mask text on devices so only someone viewing close up can read it			0
these images contain old fashioned maps of the distribution of cranial organs which can only be seen at close range to the image			0
at a distance , all that will be seen are two normal portraits hybrid images can create textures with viewing distance			1
this picture shows an example of a woman 's face that turns into a cat at close distance			2

look at the hybrid image at a normal viewing distance from the screen
if the image of @entity5 does *n't* appear , it may mean you have *bad* vision
illusion shows how we focus on different features depending on distance
