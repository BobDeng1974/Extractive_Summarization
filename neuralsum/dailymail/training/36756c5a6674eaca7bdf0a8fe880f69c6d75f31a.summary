by @entity0 it was a lottery like no other , with the fate of tiny children at stake on the pick of a ball			2
the street lights were lowered outside so that hundreds of mothers were granted anonymity as they queued at @entity12 's new @entity11 in the 1740s to give their babies away			1
@entity16 women abandoned by their seducers or lovers , together with impoverished widows who could n't support their newborns , hoped their children would have a better future inside the hospital - essentially a children 's home - which educated and trained little boys to become apprentices , and little girls as servants			1
a scene from the @entity31 's @entity32 and such was the demand for places that a ballot system of white , red and black balls had to be introduced			2
a white ball meant a baby had won a place provided it did n't have an infectious disease ; a red ball meant a child was put on the waiting list to replace those who failed their medical ; and a black ball meant the baby was turned away			0
and there was a big audience for it , with fashionable society sponsors of the hospital crowding the public gallery to watch the heart - rending process in the room where the @entity56 met			1
' it was like some dreadful tv contest - yet it was a practical solution to a very real problem , ' says @entity61 , curator of an exhibition to mark ten years of the @entity63 which stands on the site of the old hospital and which forms the backdrop for a heart - tugging new @entity31 docu - drama about it			1
@entity70 , the hospital 's treasurer , had borrowed the blackballing idea from the membership selection at 18th - century @entity12 gentlemen 's clubs such as @entity76 's			1
contemporary witnesses , however , recalled that the wailing of bereft mothers whose babies had been chosen in this impossibly poignant contest was just as loud as those whose babies had been blackballed			2
they would leave tokens behind - scraps of embroidered cloth , poems and letters , medals , coins and even just walnuts by the poorest - to identify themselves and their babies in case they could come back to claim their offspring in happier times			2
founder @entity96 , in 1855 yet since that meant repaying the hospital for the child 's keep to ensure the feckless did n't abuse the system , ' less than ten per cent of mothers did so over the two centuries that the hospital existed , ' according to @entity105 , director of the @entity63			1
the hospital was started by a big - hearted former sailor and ship - builder called @entity96 , who was horrified at the number of babies abandoned in the @entity12 streets in the 1720s when he came home from his voyages			1
he had to campaign for 17 years for a @entity115 , which he was granted in 1739 , to establish the hospital as one of @entity120 's first children 's charities			1
he was one of three childless men central to the success of the hospital			0
both @entity96 and the painter @entity124 , who became a governor , were married but with no heirs , while the composer @entity127 , also a governor , was a bachelor			0
to raise funds , @entity124 exhibited his paintings at the hospital ( and thus created @entity133 's first public art gallery ) , designed the children 's uniforms and the coat of arms , and he and his wife @entity137 fostered foundling children , while @entity127 conducted his new @entity32 masterpiece in its chapel in annual performances that brought in the crowds			1
it was the perfect link between philanthropy and the arts , with obvious benefits to both sides			0
and in what looks set to be tv 's biggest baby tear - jerker since @entity151 , @entity152 's @entity32 will tell the whole story			1
former @entity155 actor @entity154 plays @entity156 , @entity157 is @entity124 and @entity158 is @entity127 , with tv 's @entity159 with the @entity161 historian @entity160 and music critic @entity162 presenting the dramatised excerpts			2
' it 's an incredibly moving subject to film , ' says executive producer @entity166			2
' we start by restaging the first night of @entity32 at the hospital in 1750 , and later show the blackballing contest and the babies ' heads being inspected for lice			0
the children admitted were never allowed to know about the tokens their mothers had left in case they never came back ; instead the boys and girls were identified by a lead number on a chain round their necks			2
' a painting entitled @entity183 by @entity184 @entity105 continues , ' for the first five years of their lives the children were fostered in the countryside – because it was healthier than @entity12 – before being brought back to the hospital to be educated and eventually apprenticed			0
' the regime was strict by our modern standards , with the system of removing the five - year - olds from their country foster parents an obvious wrench for both sides that continued until 1954 when the hospital finally closed			0
yet governors took an interest in the children even after they 'd left to become apprentices – and would use their powers to get any savage employers of their former charges arrested and punished			0
' @entity63 children were also among the first in @entity133 to be vaccinated , ' says the show 's co-producer @entity209			1
at a time when child mortality was 99 per cent in the workhouses , the concern for the babies ' health was such that governors became ' inspectors of @entity219 ' , visiting their lodgings to make sure the women were married			0
to make doubly sure of no immorality , the inspectors were accompanied by their wives … ' the women had to plead their cases and prove the child was their first , that they were of previous good character and not entirely the agents of their own misfortune ' @entity105 by the 1830s , the increasing pressure on places meant that only illegitimate babies were admitted			0
' the women had to plead their cases and prove the child was their first , that they were of previous good character and not entirely the agents of their own misfortune - and the governors would follow up with careful checks , ' according to @entity105			0
@entity239 , who lived round the corner from the hospital in @entity242 , became a sponsor , named his kindly mr @entity244 in @entity245 after one of the hospital secretaries and wrote a play , @entity248 , with novelist @entity249 that begins at the gates of the hospital			0
his benevolence even extended to putting in a good word for one mother , @entity255 - but , embarrassingly for him , the governors turned her application down after she was found to have syphilis			0
these days celebrities continue to keep up the museum 's profile , with artist @entity261 and also the bestselling children 's authors @entity262 and @entity265 among its current patrons			1
meanwhile the hospital lives on in the children 's charity @entity96 , aptly named after the old sea - dog with the softest of hearts who founded it			1
@entity32 is on @entity152 on 19 april			1
the @entity63 's exhibition , @entity276 ! @entity127 's @entity277 , continues until 18 may , www.found lingmuseum.org.uk .			0

an *emotional* new drama will shed light on @entity133 's first children 's home
it documents a heart - breaking tale of mothers with nowhere else to turn
the new series will hit our screens on 19 april on @entity152
