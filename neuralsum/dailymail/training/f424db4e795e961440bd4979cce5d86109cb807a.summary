by @entity0 it 's the house where @entity2 murdered his wife and dragged her body through autumn leaves to the carport			1
then he drove @entity7 away from her family home and her sleeping daughters for the last time			0
it is a house which has become eerily familiar to millions of @entity12 , who followed weeks of evidence in the @entity2 murder trial , the site from which screams and thuds were heard on the night @entity7 disappeared			1
the property 's owners installed a caretaker and now plan to build another dwelling on the one hectare site to extend their adjacent child care business it 's the place where ms @entity2 inflicted the telltale scratches on her husband as he probably smothered her , with the back yard where leaves unique to the property became entangled in her hair and clothing			2
it was as if the house itself was giving evidence during the five week murder trial , with its plant specimens , its neatness after the murderer tidied up , the position of parked family cars and the placement of the killer 's mobile phone charger all telling points in the prosecution case			1
but 593 @entity23 , @entity24 in @entity43 's west is also the house where no - one wants to live , barring a caretaker and administration staff for the child care centre which occupies the same address			1
@entity94 first put the house back on the market in august 2012 , four months after @entity7 had disappeared and 10 weeks after @entity21 was charged with her murder			2
the four - bedroom , two bathroom home with its dated pink and peach decor was available for a weekly rent of $ 460			0
but as photographs of the house show , its bare , stained rooms either failed to excite or its bloody past spooked potential renters			0
grisly history : it was the home where the marriage of @entity7 and @entity21 ( pictured , left , on their wedding day in 1997 ) finally unravelled in a bloody struggle which resulted in her death , but not before she had clawed his face ( right ) as she fought him to her death			0
now the home has failed to attract renters and is occupied by the caretaker of an adjacent child care centre if the walls could speak : as if the house itself was giving testimony during the @entity2 murder trial , certain aspects spoke volumes to investigating detectives who fund the kitchen ( pictured ) had been wiped clean and the bathroom had no trace of the killer 's purported shaving accident			1
growing in the backyard were plant specimens a botanist would link to leaf litter found on @entity7 's body screams , plants and blood : evidence given during the @entity2 trial which compelled the jury into convicting @entity2 of the murder of his wife @entity7 were that screams came from the house ( pictured ) , leaf specimens came from the back yard and @entity7 's blood was found in her @entity153 which was parked in the car port scuffle on the patio : recreated by @entity158 's 60 minutes programme , the scuffle which ended @entity7 's life was depicted as happening in the back yard of the @entity2 home , after which she was taken to a creek bed 14km away			1
the house has failed to rent since after the house failed to rent , owners of the large one hectare block , on which there is the @entity167 , made a development application ( @entity170 ) to extend the childcare facilities			2
the da approved by @entity172 notes the house where @entity7 was murdered as merely ' existing caretaker 's dwelling '			2
the car port where police photographs showed @entity7 's @entity153 - the vehicle @entity21 used to transport his wife 's body to @entity181 - is slated as ' proposed car parks '			1
when @entity184 visited the site , the car par was full of cars and desks with computers were set up inside the former @entity189 home with administration staff for the child care centre busy and working			2
the approved da shows plans for a new building to boost the capacity of the facility from 75 to 123 children			0
in 2012 , four months after @entity7 's murder , the @entity44 branch of @entity41 real estate had listed the home as a ' must inspect ' property , with open - plan living and an entertainment patio			1
it was across the home 's back patio that viewers of @entity158 's 60 minutes programme on sunday about the @entity2 case watched the recreation by the of @entity21 dragging his wife 's body			1
photographs of the house taken just months after the murder show leaves scattered on the pavers			0
compelling testimony during trial which gripped the public and helped convince a @entity43 @entity221 jury of the accused 's guilt involved six botanic specimens			2
real estate ethics expert @entity224 says the @entity2 house ( pictured , in property photos fur months after the murder ) may have failed to rent because nobody knows in what room the murder actually took place it 's not the faded 1980s pink and peach decor of the @entity2 home ( pictured ) which put people off , but what went on there			1
not only did @entity21 kill his wife while his children were sleeping in the house , he subjected her to years of emotional abuse within its walls a police photograph taken just four days after @entity7 's murder shows the same house with the family 's belongings strewn about			1
four months on , with the house emptied of all trace of the tragic family , real estate agency @entity41 could attract no renters and now tow years later , the property owners are extending a child care centre on the site cat 's claw , eucalyptus , crepe myrtle , chinese elm , lilli pilli and fishbone fern were found both on @entity7 's body and growing in the back yard of 593 @entity23 , @entity24			1
samples of the specimens ( pictured ) were used as compelling evidence to convict @entity21 cat 's claw , eucalyptus , crepe myrtle , chinese elm , lilli pilli and fishbone fern were found both on @entity7 's body and growing in the back yard			1
another factor in the trial was lack of blood in the bathroom to support @entity21 's claims he had cut himself shaving , and an overly tidy house - police suspected he had cleaned up			2
evidence included the fact police could detect @entity2 had plugged his mobile phone into its charger at 1.38am , when he claimed to be in a heavy sleep			1
the placement of the power point on his side of the bed , when he claimed he had relinquished his phone to @entity7 , as well as the layout of the house were factors in the trial			1
the @entity296 houses where @entity297 murdered his parents and sister in 2001 and where five members of the @entity302 family were slain in 2009 have both sold , albeit at reduced prices , but the @entity2 ' murder house ' ( pictured ) has failed to attract anyone interested in renting despite it being advertised two years ago for $ 460 a week			2
haunted house : the property 593 @entity23 , @entity24 is in a prestige area of western @entity43 but when it was offered for rental , no family was interested			2
it is now being developed and a caretake lives in the house ' murder houses " or homes where significant crimes have taken place are required to be advertised with full disclosure of the grisly event , which brings the price down but does not preclude a sale			0
the @entity296 house in which @entity297 murdered his parents and sister in 2001 , sold in 2005 for $ 720,000 after the owners tried to offload it for $ 800,000 without disclosing its past the house in the north - western @entity296 suburb of @entity330 , in which five members of the @entity302 family were slain in 2009 , was sold after remaining empty for three years following the murders			0
real estate ethics expert , @entity224 , was the property agent who blew the whistle on the attempted sale without disclosure of the @entity297 family house			1
mr @entity224 said the @entity2 family house may not have rented because an agent could not specifically point out the room where the crime took place			0
mr @entity224 told @entity184 families seeking to rent the @entity2 house would be ' spooked ' by not knowing exactly what went on in the house			0
' only @entity21 knows what he did in that house , ' mr @entity224 said			0
' anyone going into the house would have to think " where did he do it ? "			0
' it is such a creepy thing			0
' a lot of people are quite religious or superstitious and one of the things they do when they buy a house is get a priest in to bless it			0
' generally speaking if a gruesome murder has gone on it takes about ten per cent off the price			0
' but if there 's a bit of a mystery , well it spooks people			0
' mr @entity224 said after his intervention in the @entity297 house sale , potential buyers knew all the gory details about where @entity297 had committed his murders in the house , and that the family home had sold .			0

property agents failed to rent out the @entity2 murder house
prosecutors say @entity2 smothered wife @entity7 at the house in western @entity43
@entity382 has housed only a caretaker and administration staff since @entity2 's arrest
the house gave up its own evidence in the trial *...* six plant specimens found in its *garden* and on @entity7 's body
police also made note the placement of the power point where @entity2 fired his mobile phone
real estate ethics expert says the home ' spooks ' renters who think it 's ' creepy ' because they do *n't* know where murder occurred
