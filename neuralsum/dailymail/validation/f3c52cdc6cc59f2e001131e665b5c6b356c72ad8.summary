@entity1 chief @entity0 has called for the creation of an @entity1 army @entity5 chief @entity0 has called for the creation of an @entity1 army in the wake of rising tensions with @entity9			1
the @entity10 said an @entity1 military force would help defend the continent from @entity14 's aggression			1
he said : ' you would not create a @entity17 army to use it immediately			0
' but a common army among the @entity17 would convey to @entity9 that we are serious about defending the values of the @entity1			1
' he said a joint @entity1 force would be more economical than each country individually ordering their own military kit			1
it would also drive further integration of the bloc 's 28 member states			0
' such an army would help us design a common foreign and security policy , ' the former @entity31 prime minister said			2
he insisted the army would not challenge @entity37 's role defending @entity17 from @entity9 aggression			2
mr @entity0 , speaking to the @entity40 newspaper @entity39 , said : ' @entity17 's image has suffered dramatically and also in terms of foreign policy , we do n't seem to be taken entirely seriously			1
' the proposal is likely to infuriate conservative backbenchers but has been welcomed in @entity40			0
@entity40 's defence minister @entity46 said in a statement that ' our future as @entity17 will one day be a @entity17 army ' although she added ' not in the short term '			0
she said such a move would ' strengthen @entity17 's security ' and ' strengthen a @entity17 pillar in the transatlantic alliance '			0
but @entity56 's defence spokesman @entity55 said a @entity17 army would be ' a tragedy for the @entity59 '			0
he said : ' we have all seen the utter mess the @entity1 has made of the eurozone economy , so how can we even think of trusting them with this island 's defence ? ' this is simply a disaster in the making that would see @entity68 returned to @entity69 and the @entity70 left open to an unopposed invasion by @entity72			2
' even more concerning would be the prospect of @entity59 troops under @entity17 command operating in the eastern @entity76			2
' @entity78 president said an @entity1 military force would help defend continent from @entity14 's aggression foreign secretary @entity82 said relations between @entity9 and the @entity1 are likely to be ' prickly ' for many years it comes amid warnings that relations between @entity9 and the @entity1 are likely to be ' prickly ' for many years			1
the foreign secretary @entity82 warned that significant further sanctions could be imposed by the @entity1 unless @entity87 abided by the terms of the @entity76 ceasefire			1
he said under mr @entity90 had moved from being a partner of the @entity92 to seeing @entity17 as an ' adversary '			0
mr @entity14 's view of @entity9 's influence over former @entity97 states ' puts him at odds ' with the @entity92 , mr @entity82 said			2
newly mobilized @entity76 paratroopers wait to board a helicopter as tensions rise with @entity9 on @entity103 's @entity102 , mr @entity82 warned that further aggression by @entity87 - backed separatists in @entity76 would trigger an escalation in the sanctions regime			1
' we have all made clear that if there is a big assault , for example on @entity111 , that will be responded to with a significant increase in the economic pressure on @entity9 from the @entity1 , ' he said			1
asked if that could trigger a new @entity117 he said : ' i do n't want to talk about cold wars , but we are clear that @entity9 has decided , it has made the decision that it wants to be in a strategic competition with the @entity92 , with @entity17			2
' it does n't any longer see us as partners , it sees us as competitors or even adversaries and that means that we are going to have a difficult , prickly relationship with @entity9 probably for some time to come			2
' ' we do n't think there can be a military resolution to this crisis			0
the disparity between the size of the @entity76 armed forces and the @entity9 armed forces does n't make that a sensible way to go			1
' we have to insist that the rules - based system which says very clearly that you ca n't change international boundaries by force , is protected			0
' although mr @entity82 said it was clear that ' we are not going to fight the @entity9 in @entity76 ' , the @entity59 was providing support to @entity144			1
' we are providing training , we are providing technical support , we provide them with non-lethal equipment , ' he said			0
' we have said that we will keep this under review			0
' he said that under the peace plan agreed in @entity153 , @entity87 has committed to handing back control of all of @entity76 's territory , including the border with @entity9 , by the end of this year			1
' we have to hold them to that			0
if that does n't happen @entity9 can expect the temperature to be turned up significantly , ' he said			2
a machine gun sits inside a @entity164 rebel trench along the front lines two kilometers from @entity76 troops he stressed that there was a ' hard red line ' protecting @entity37 's @entity170 members from @entity9 incursions , with the option of invoking the alliance 's measure allowing for collective defence : ' mr @entity14 knows that very well and that is what protects the @entity177			1
' mr @entity82 claimed the @entity9 president believed he had ' some kind of strategic veto ' over the freedom of action of former @entity97 states			1
' that puts him , frankly , at odds with our view of the @entity190 settlement in @entity17 , ' the foreign secretary said			0
pressed on the @entity37 2 % spending target , mr @entity82 said : ' i ca n't tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto , but you will find out soon enough , and i ca n't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election			0
' but @entity202 led the charge on the @entity37 2 % commitment at the summit in @entity206 last year			0
