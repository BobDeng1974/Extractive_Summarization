@entity0 likes to project an image as the ' chillaxing ' statesman unruffled by political troubles - but this morning his usual demeanour seemed to desert him as he donned a bizarre outfit on the campaign trail			1
the prime minister looked exhausted as he stepped off the sleeper train at @entity9 today , ahead of a speech in which he delivered his ' plan for @entity13 '			1
the @entity14 are battling against their @entity16 partners in the @entity17 as they seek to wrest control of key constituencies from the @entity20			2
but mr @entity0 is still trailing @entity22 's @entity21 nationally , with just 14 days to go until polling day			1
get - up : @entity0 stepped off the sleeper train at @entity9 this morning wearing jeans , smart shoes and a navy jacket journey : the prime minister travelled for eight hours from @entity31 station to reach @entity13 tired out : the @entity14 leader did not appear to have enjoyed a good night 's sleep on the train and was wearing an unusual combination of solely dark colours a @entity38 poll published this morning put @entity21 on 34 per cent - one point ahead of the @entity40			1
the @entity20 trail on 7 per cent with @entity42 in third on 14 per cent			1
mr @entity0 said in an interview this week that he ' always manages to portray a calm smoothness ' - however , he looked anything but smooth at @entity9 station			1
the prime minister seemed as if he had had trouble sleeping on the eight - hour journey from @entity51 's @entity31 station			1
his hair was unkempt and he was wearing an unusual combination of jeans with shiny loafers which might be considered more appropriate for a smart business suit			2
destination : he apparently chose the sleeper to avoid taking time out of his schedule to travel @entity60 : mr @entity0 wore a navy jacket , dark blue shirt , jeans and smart black shoes - as well as a red box inspiration ? mr @entity0 may have been trying to channel the style sense of @entity69 president @entity68 mr @entity0 sported a navy jacket with a dark blue polo shirt , and set off his outfit with the ultimate status symbol - a red box holding ministerial papers , which only a few dozen people are entitled to carry			1
while the jacket may have looked inoffensive , the @entity14 leader may have been making a political statement in support of the @entity81 , as it appears to have been made by @entity83 firm @entity82			2
similar models retail online for around Â£ 125			0
speaking at a factory later , he insisted that he had in fact slept very well - because his wife @entity88 was not there to complain about him talking in his sleep			0
mr @entity0 said : ' it was very comfortable , very nice it was too , to have a night without the children waking me up or mrs @entity95 nudging me in the ribs and telling me to shut up for talking in my sleep			2
' in an interview with the @entity99 published yesterday , mr @entity0 was asked why he has a reputation for lacking passion while on the campaign trail			2
changed : the leader put on a more formal outfit for his speech at a company in @entity9 gimmick : mr @entity0 tried out a selfie stick during a visit to radio station @entity110 today snap : the prime minister used the gadget to take this photograph of himself with the station 's staff he replied : ' i do n't know			1
there is something about me - i always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something			0
' but he went on to point to his hectic campaigning schedule - as shown by his decision to spend the night on the sleeper train in order to reduce his travel time in the day			2
while the overnight journey from @entity51 to @entity9 lasts eight hours , mr @entity0 would have had to carve out five hours from his schedule if he had travelled to @entity13 in the daytime			1
there is also a 70 - minute flight from @entity132 to @entity133 , not far from @entity9 , but the prime minister may have calculated that taking the train is likely to project a more down - to - earth image			1
fun : the prime minister took part in selfies with @entity14 activists during one of his @entity144 campaign stops speech : workers at the @entity148 dairy factory in @entity149 watch mr @entity0 address them back to business : in the afternoon the prime minister flew to @entity152 for a summit on the ongoing @entity155 migrant crisis the constituency of @entity157 , where @entity9 is located , is the most remote in the @entity159 because it also contains the @entity160			1
it is typically the last area to declare its results after a general election , due to the need to transport ballots from the islands to the mainland the morning after the vote			0
the seat is currently held by @entity20 @entity171 , but the @entity40 will be keen to overturn his 1,719 majority as part of efforts to drive the party out of the @entity17			1
in his speech at a scaffolding firm this morning , mr @entity0 told activists that @entity21 do not care about anything ' west of @entity180 ' , adding : ' now imagine what it would be like if @entity183 was calling the shots			1
' how the true blue @entity151 takes refuge in navy outfits for work and play the prime minister is known for his love of navy outfits - nearly all of his suits are dark blue , and he also sports the inoffensive colour when on holiday in @entity159 or abroad			1
he often resorts to navy polo shirts even while wearing casual attire such as shorts or flip - flops , having apparently calculated that the shade suits him and is unlikely to cause a political stir compared to more outlandish choices			0
on the campaign trail in recent weeks he has usually donned a navy suit - with the main exception being when he puts on high - viz jacket and hard hat for a visit to a factory			0
favourite : mr @entity0 often wears navy blue when he is off duty , like in this photograph from his @entity144 holiday in summer 2013 relaxed : the prime minister wore dark blue again while on holiday with wife @entity88 in @entity219 last year suit : mr @entity0 was wearing a dark jacket and trousers at a campaign event in @entity224 yesterday superspy : @entity0 has backed @entity225 to take over the role of @entity227 @entity0 has backed his @entity229 colleague @entity225 to be the next @entity227 - saying that it 's time for @entity159 's most famous spy to be portrayed by a @entity232			1
speaking to @entity235 's @entity234 , the prime minister was asked who he thought should take over from @entity237 when he gives up the role of 007			2
mr @entity0 replied : ' i 'm a @entity240 man so who is most like @entity240 ? is it time for a @entity232 @entity227 ? is it time for @entity225 to step forward ? ' he 's fit , he 's healthy , he does yoga , he can probably crack a man 's skull between his knee caps			0
i 'd go for @entity225			0
' you know we might have to sort out one or two things but i think he 'd be good			0
' mr @entity225 , the former @entity14 leader and foreign secretary , is set to have time on his hand after the election because he is retiring from @entity255			0
mr @entity0 's rivals have previously weighed in on the @entity227 question - @entity22 said he thought @entity258 should become the first female 007 , while @entity259 proposed himself for the action role			0
in today 's interview , the prime minister also confessed to his love of @entity264 , saying : ' i am a big @entity265 , i think it 's great			2
i went to the set the other day			0
' so i 've stood on the wall			0
i 've held @entity269 ... @entity271 's sword			0
i was in @entity273 's bedroom			0
' well it 's a bit like politics but actually , you know , you die even faster in @entity264 than you do in my chosen profession			0
