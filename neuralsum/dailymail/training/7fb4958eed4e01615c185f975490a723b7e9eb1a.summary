after a difficult few weeks of infighting , scandals and gaffes , @entity0 could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention			1
but as the @entity6 leader walked through central @entity7 this morning he seemed unimpressed by an appearance by @entity9 - or at least a very good look - a - like			1
to make matters worse , the bizarre stunt happened hours before the party suspended @entity6 candidate @entity13 , who this week compared mr @entity0 to @entity14			1
he failed to see the funny side when confronted by @entity24 , aka @entity9 of @entity25			1

' she said every year ad agencies compete to produce the best festive stunt			0
' for us , there was something amazing about literally going back to the original idea - just seeing the immediacy of a powerful symbol sent out into the streets and how people are reacting to it			0
' it comes just days after one @entity6 candidate compared mr @entity0 to @entity9			1
@entity44 spokesman @entity13 , who is a former professional boxer and has previously courted controversy with remarks about gay adoption , said the party leader can ' do no wrong '			1
' @entity9 was one man , we 're his army			1
@entity0 is one man , and we 're his army and that 's what it 's all about , ' he said			1
