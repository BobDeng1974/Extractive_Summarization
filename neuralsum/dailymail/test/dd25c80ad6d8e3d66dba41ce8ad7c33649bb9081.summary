he was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight , so when @entity5 conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst – for himself and the club ’s top - flight status			1
that was four weeks ago when @entity10 ran riot at the @entity12 and @entity13 were booed from the field at half - time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits			1
within 48 hours @entity18 had been sacked and @entity19 was being installed			1

‘ before the new manager came , our confidence was not in a good way , ’ said the 28 - year - old , who was a @entity43 winner with @entity44 in 2012 and again last season			1
‘ we were playing very badly , but now we have a new motivation			2
he ’s brought the enjoyment back			2

away from home we were taking points , but in front of our fans we were failing			0

i did n’t know what we could do to be better			0
’ the answer , it appears , was @entity19			1

‘ before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this			0
i think these words said everything , the motivation was at 100 per cent			0
‘ the atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after @entity44 won the league ( in 2012 )			1
my wife and my parents were there and they loved the game			0

‘ my father told me it was better to go in goal			0
he said i had the physical attributes to play there			0
‘ but i was not always so tall			0
i had a period between 14 and 16 when i grew so fast			0
‘ thankfully , i did n’t like basketball so much			0
