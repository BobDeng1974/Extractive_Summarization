by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has mysteriously closed down a £ 2.5 million @entity4 company which has apparently helped her avoid paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in @entity6 corporation tax in the last three years			1
the company , @entity7 , set up in 2011 , was widely seen as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax on her international earnings than would be owed in @entity6			2
but both @entity13 and its @entity6 - based parent company @entity14 were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months , suggesting that the star is keen to avoid accusations that she is dodging tax			1
@entity22 has recently closed an @entity4 company the move came just days before @entity25 and two other members of @entity6 ’s most successful boy band , @entity28 , learned that they owed millions in unpaid tax after an investment vehicle they had been using was ruled to be a tax avoidance scheme			1
while @entity22 ’s actions are perfectly legal , the last accounts for @entity13 showed assets of £ 2.5 million at the end of 2012 , suggesting earnings of at least this much have been funnelled through the company			1
if so , the singer would have avoided paying more than £ 200,000 in tax that would have been owed in @entity6			2
this is the difference between the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent in the republic – compared to 21 per cent in the @entity6			1
@entity2 's company @entity45 has been wound up meanwhile , documents for the liquidation of the @entity6 company , @entity49 – which in 2013 only declared £ 1 in net assets – now show it has cash of £ 1.88 million , which is likely to be paid to @entity22 as the company ’s sole owner once liquidation is complete			1
if the money has been moved from @entity4 to the @entity6 , taxes could be liable on that amount			0
but last night a leading accountant said that @entity22 could add to her savings by declaring the windfall as a capital gain , liable for 10 per cent tax under business tax relief rules – as opposed to paying up to 45 per cent income tax on declared income			2
@entity25 ( left ) used a tax avoidance scheme that left him owing millions ; @entity68 ( right ) channelled more than £ 400,000 through his @entity4 company in 2012 ‘ [ @entity4 companies ] are a very popular way of lowering the amount of corporation tax owed compared to that in the @entity6 , ’ he said			1
‘ when you bring your money back into @entity6 , if you liquidate your company , the money can be drawn out as a capital gain which means you only pay 10 per cent tax			0
’ neither @entity22 ’s @entity4 accountant nor her spokesman would comment last night , but company filings seen by @entity83 confirm @entity22 ’s role in the company : ‘ @entity7 was 100 per cent owned by @entity45 a company registered in the @entity6			1
the directors consider the ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party of the company to be @entity2			0
’ @entity13 and @entity14 were set up with the help of @entity4 music industry accountant @entity92 , who is the accountant for some of the @entity6 and @entity4 ’s biggest names in music			2
he lists money - making machine @entity97 , @entity99 and a host of other stars among his clients			0
last year it was reported that another client , former x factor star @entity68 , incurred an @entity4 tax bill of € 61,735 ( £ 49,067 ) on earnings of € 516,816 ( £ 410,765 ) through his @entity4 company in 2012 – much less than he would have paid in the @entity6			2
@entity92 also acts for @entity108 and his estranged wife @entity109 , and has also looked after @entity110 and @entity111			0
just this month , @entity92 set up a company with @entity97 member @entity113 called @entity114 – adding to suggestions that the heart - throb star may be about to launch a solo career			0
a statement on @entity92 ’s website reads : ‘ our strength lies in bespoke financial and accounting packages to suit the client			0
our services can range from dealing with a client once a year regarding tax compliance to dealing with a client on a week to week basis on their financial and accounting management			0
’ @entity22 ’s rearrangement of her financial affairs comes amid growing condemnation of all forms of tax avoidance in the @entity6			1
in the last two years companies such as @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 have been heavily criticised for declaring their profits in @entity4 and other low tax jurisdictions , while celebrities have also come under the @entity149 spotlight			0
@entity149 always refuses to comment on individual cases but has previously emphasised it will not ‘ tolerate abuse of the system ’ .			0
