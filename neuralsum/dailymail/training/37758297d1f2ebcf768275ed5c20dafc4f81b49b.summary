by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 came under fire from @entity4 again as he began preparing for a ‘ home ’ test at @entity6 that could take him to the brink of @entity10 bowling history			1
@entity2 , dramatically cleared of abusing and pushing @entity12 last week , will go into thursday ’s fourth test needing only 13 wickets to become @entity16 ’s leading wicket - taker of all time but with @entity4 still seething over his behaviour at @entity19			1
the speed with which judicial commissioner @entity21 threw out a @entity23 charge against @entity2 on friday was an embarrassment for @entity4 , but they are showing little sign of taking it on the chin and moving on			1
common sense prevails : @entity2 has been cleared lf physically assaulting @entity30 ( r ) spat : @entity2 and @entity12 were embroiled in a row as they left the @entity19 pitch delight : @entity2 can not hide his emotions after dismissing @entity12 at the @entity37 @entity38 and @entity2 cleared of wrong - doing an unnamed @entity40 official was scathing in his criticism of @entity16 ’s attack leader on the respected @entity44 website and it is clear that a country who are used to getting their own way still hope to force an appeal			1
‘ clearly the judgment is incorrect , ’ said the @entity52 official of a verdict made by @entity21 in just 10 minutes after six hours of expensive evidence			1
‘ and it sets a very bad example			0
there were a series of errors			0
the level of abuse has been ridiculous and the @entity63 have a lot to answer for			2
what example does it set for kids and others watching ? it sends the message that it is ok to abuse and push and you ’ll still go scot - free			2
‘ the umpire ( @entity71 ) has mentioned in his witness statement that @entity2 used the ‘ f ’ and ‘ c ’ words repeatedly			0
why have n’t the officials reported him to the @entity63 ? if they have , why has no action been taken ? ’ the comments confirm that the crux of @entity4 ’s high - handed complaint , which was driven by captain @entity81 despite attempts by the @entity63 , @entity83 and even his own @entity84 to talk him out of it , was sparked by @entity2 ’s sledging			1
the man who could overtake sir @entity88 by the end of this series is quiet , almost shy , off the field but gets himself into ‘ battle mode ’ when he steps on to it			0
@entity2 has talked about the two sides to his personality and his work with a sports psychologist , calling himself @entity2 on the field and @entity2 off it			0
@entity16 feel @entity2 is at his best when he is @entity2 but also in control of his emotions			2
he is already @entity16 ’s leading wicket - taker in all international cricket and , just 32 , he looks poised to break every record in the book , testament to his exceptional competitiveness , skill and work ethic			2
the question now is whether the @entity110 can keep his aggression in check and still bowl as well as he did at the @entity37 when he reached heights not seen from him for over a year			0
and avoid any more flashpoints			0
leader of the attack : @entity2 was man of the match in @entity16 's third @entity119 win at the @entity37 for fourth test vs @entity4 at @entity6 , starting on august 7 @entity121 ( c ) , @entity122 , @entity2 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 ( wkt ) , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132			1
any appeal against the @entity136 judge ’s verdict — and @entity21 also cleared @entity12 of all wrong - doing — can only come through @entity63 chief executive @entity137 and there seemed little appetite for official intervention on monday despite @entity4 ’s huffing and puffing			1
the deadline for an appeal and a further twist in this acrimonious tale is friday			0
@entity16 ’s perfect script sees @entity2 driving @entity16 to victory in this series and overtaking @entity88 in the final test at the @entity150 , his 99th and the last @entity16 will play until they tour the @entity151 next april			1
yet @entity2 has never taken five wickets in an innings on his home ground			0
it now seems certain that @entity125 will be fit enough to take his place , while @entity157 looks sure to get another chance , leaving three bowlers competing for the last seam place			0
@entity127 is in possession and was exceptional at @entity6 in the one - day international against @entity162 this season , while @entity131 is a strong contender on what is expected to be the quickest pitch of the @entity167 series			1
@entity16 have to be careful they do not chop and change too much but there is a strong case for @entity170 , added to the squad on sunday when @entity128 pulled out with injury , to leapfrog @entity173 and @entity131 on a pitch where his extra pace could well prove a handful			0
ulterior motives ? @entity16 believe that @entity12 's accusations were a purely tactical move by @entity4			2

@entity2 was found not **guilty** of @entity182 **offence** by @entity63
@entity16 seamer is free to play remaining tests at @entity6 and the @entity150
@entity4 all - rounder @entity12 was also found not **guilty** of any **offence**
verdict was reached in 10 minutes by @entity136 judge @entity21
@entity192 is delighted to have @entity2 for rest of @entity167 series
