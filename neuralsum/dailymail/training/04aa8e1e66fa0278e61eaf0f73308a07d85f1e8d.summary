@entity1 boss @entity0 believes former @entity3 forward @entity2 has found his feet in @entity5 and can be a big hit in the @entity7 this season			1
many were surprised when @entity2 swapped the @entity10 for the @entity11 in a Â£ 3million - move in the summer and the former @entity3 trainee enjoyed a promising start , scoring three times during pre-season			2
@entity2 struggled to transfer that form into the first few games of the @entity7 season but the 24 - year - old started and scored a superb opening goal in @entity1 's 2 - 1 victory at @entity22 on sunday			1
@entity1 striker @entity2 celebrates after scoring in his side 's 2 - 1 win at @entity22 on sunday the former @entity3 man opened the scoring for @entity0 ' side with a fine strike at @entity29 ' we 're really pleased he 's finally come to the fore , ' @entity0 said			1
' he started like a house on fire in pre-season and i think people got a bit carried away too early - we all felt it was going to take him time to adjust			0
' i played him the first two games and he found it difficult to have an impact			0
' he 's bided his time though and we 've reintroduced him now and he 's had the benefit of three or four months training at the intensity he needs and he 's looking a very accomplished player again			0
' @entity2 was considered one of the most talented strikers in @entity49 while he was coming through the ranks at @entity3 but the @entity51 was unable to live up to expectations during loan spells at @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes @entity2 is starting to find his best form after a difficult start in the league @entity2 came through @entity3 's academy but was allowed to leave for the @entity7 last summer @entity0 , however , believes the creative forward has the strengths to be a success in the @entity7			1
' we 're going to benefit from his ability and his goalscoring because he 's a good talent when he gets in good areas of the field , ' @entity0 added			2
' he gets shots off early and its difficult for keepers to react quickly enough			0
he 'll score goals for us this year			0
