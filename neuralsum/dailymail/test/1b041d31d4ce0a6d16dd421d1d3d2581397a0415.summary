opening sentencing last month , prosecutor @entity155 said : ' having been remanded in custody by the court , and realising the reality of what he had led himself into , and what was waiting to be uncovered , he promptly set about adapting his skills for deceit , dishonesty and forgery to that new environment and he engineered his escape			0
