the peer said a recent survey by @entity49 had reviewed @entity5 rail fares and although the ‘ overall picture was mixed ’ the country compared favourably with other @entity54 countries ‘ in respect of many ticket types particularly on longer distance tickets purchased in advance ’			1
but @entity60 's @entity59 told him : ‘ tickets on the day of travel are invariably far more expensive that advanced travel tickets			0
