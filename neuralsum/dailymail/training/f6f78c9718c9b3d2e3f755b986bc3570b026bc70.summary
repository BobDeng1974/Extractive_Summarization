a former @entity1 defender crashed his penalty against the woodwork and @entity5 ’s unwanted goalkeeper emerged a @entity7 hero for a team coached by a man who was sacked after seven months at @entity10			1
@entity12 ’s elite are back home - or in @entity14 or the @entity15 - with their expensively - insured feet up , resting ahead of the new season while others , many from the depths of the @entity19 and below , are making an impact in @entity22			1
in four years at the @entity39 , @entity28 ’s most memorable contribution was a violent lunge on @entity41 which reduced @entity37 to nine men in a vital game at @entity45 , but he has been a fixture at the back in this dashing @entity49 team			2
alongside him there ’s @entity51 , seemingly held together by sticky - tape and rubber bands , at the end of a gruelling and emotional season in which he was unable to keep @entity55 in the @entity19			1
having seen off @entity57 , the @entity56 took the hosts to penalties , only to be thwarted by two saves in the shoot - out by @entity25			1
that ’s the same @entity25 who appeared once for @entity5 last season ( a 4 - 0 @entity65 defeat at @entity66 ) and was kept out of the side by @entity68 ( not good enough for @entity12 ’s squad ) and then farmed out on loan to @entity71			1
@entity72 reject : @entity73 celebrates after @entity75 's 2 - 1 win against @entity76 in the group stages captain : @entity37 defender @entity79 leads @entity80 into the dressing room after their win over @entity83 when @entity75 line up for their quarter - final against @entity87 @entity86 ’s @entity22 on friday , @entity73 will probably be at left - back			1
@entity73 joined @entity72 on loan from @entity90 in january and has since signed for @entity91 , but started only three games for the @entity72 , kept out mostly by @entity93			0
it defies the idea that you have to be playing in the @entity97 to prosper in the @entity7 , and supports the theory that whatever makes you effective in the @entity19 , does not automatically transfer to international football			2
in @entity80 ’s squad were @entity102 , @entity79 and @entity103 , who have not dazzled in @entity105 club football			0
@entity106 included @entity19 flops @entity107 ( @entity108 ) and @entity109 ( @entity111 nightclub ) in the team which started against @entity113 in @entity114			2
it was @entity116 who scored @entity106 's goal against @entity120 's side , and appeared to have put @entity106 through to the quarter - finals , only for a late @entity123 surge to turn the game around			0
@entity108 flop : @entity23 celebrates his goal that put @entity127 ahead in their last - 16 clash with @entity130 are you watching @entity132 ? @entity134 powers past @entity19 talent worth more than £ 50million @entity127 won @entity12 ’s group , powered by @entity134 ( no games in three years as an @entity139 player , although this is a work - permit influenced fact ) and @entity23 ( booed out of @entity108 and exiled on loan at @entity143 )			1
in @entity145 on sunday , they met @entity130 , who featured in their squad two more @entity108 misfits : ancient warrior @entity149 and @entity150 , destined to go down as perhaps the biggest waste of money at @entity153 since @entity154			0
@entity155 have advanced with @entity156 of @entity157 , @entity158 , another who failed to impress at @entity108 , @entity160 , once of @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 and talented @entity111 youngster @entity164			2
earning his @entity111 : @entity164 controls the ball during @entity155 's match against @entity167 in @entity168 free agent : @entity170 tussles with @entity171 for the ball during @entity174 's game against @entity175 @entity174 , who take on @entity177 on monday , contain several familiar names from @entity105 football like @entity170 , @entity180 and @entity181 , @entity182 driving star of @entity185 transfer deadline day special with three permanent clubs in less than a year , who scored the only goal of the game against @entity175 to clinch a place in the last 16			0
ever - present at the back is @entity193 , a 20 - year - old @entity10 centre - half signed from @entity195 as a teenager who spent last season on loan at @entity199			0
with him in defence has been @entity201 , long of @entity66 , now of @entity202 , who spent six months at @entity203 helping them into the championship			0
then there ’s the @entity207 , with rejects like @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 , oft - ridiculed centre - half when at @entity139 and @entity108 who is poised to return to the @entity19 with @entity214 , thriving in a national team who provide @entity12 with their next competitive opposition , in september			1
it might be tempting fate to say much more			0
challenge : former @entity72 midfielder @entity210 flies into a tackle with @entity222 delight : ex-spurs and @entity225 forward @entity109 celebrates his goal against @entity113 in the second round			0

@entity12 crashed out of their group but a number of players who failed to make the cut in the @entity19 have been lighting up the *tournament*
@entity108 *outcast* @entity23 has been one of @entity127 's stars
@entity25 did *n't* even make the bench at @entity5 last season , but he was @entity22 's hero in their penalty shoot - out win against @entity49
