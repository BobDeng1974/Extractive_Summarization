by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor work and pensions secretary @entity2 said employers should try to hire a @entity5 worker first @entity5 firms should ‘ try one of our unemployed people first ’ before looking to hire foreign workers , @entity2 has claimed			1
the @entity2 said more jobs were now going to people born in the @entity5 after years of cheap labour from overseas undercutting @entity14			1
however , @entity16 law makes it illegal to discriminate against workers from elsewhere in the @entity19			2
the number of @entity5 - born workers in a job rose by 1.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2013 , but among foreign - born workers it rose by 3.3 per cent to 4.45million			1
since january 2007 , the number of @entity5 - born workers in a job has risen by 1.1million but only 153,000 among @entity14			1
but mr @entity2 said : ‘ now more jobs are going to @entity5 workers than went originally			1
so that is the beginning of a change , but i ’m very keen to thrash that out so “ try one of our unemployed people first before you go anywhere else ”			0
’ he revealed his shock at the message people trying to find work near the @entity37			2
‘ i was in a @entity41 at the time of the @entity37 in my area of @entity44			2
we were in the @entity46 boroughs and there ’s a big debate about how much work actually went to those boroughs , ’ he told the @entity39 magazine			0
‘ i was talking to a plumber and a carpenter , trained , qualified individuals			0
and i asked them about the @entity46 sites			0
‘ and they said : “ they ’re all or mostly people coming in from @entity59 who undercut us because they all hotbed in these areas and then they ’re gone			0
i ca n’t compete with them on this because i ’ve got a house , i ’ve got kids , i ’ve got commitments , there ’s only so far i can go on salary , otherwise it ’s worse for me than being on benefits ”			0
’ but @entity69 , @entity70 's head of policy , said : ' if the government were serious about @entity5 jobs for @entity5 people , then why are they currently advertising nearly a million jobs on the @entity19 's job mobility portal to workers from across the whole @entity19 ? ' the fact is that only @entity70 will prioritise @entity5 workers for these jobs by pulling out of the @entity19 and ending open border immigration			1
' earlier this month new @entity84 immigration minister @entity83 caused a storm when he claimed middle class families had enjoyed the benefits of cheap foreign labour , but the working classes had been squeezed out of jobs			1
mr @entity91 said : ‘ for too long , the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour ; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services – but not to the ordinary , hard - working people of this country			1
we are changing that and building a system that benefits all			0
' since january 2007 , the number of @entity5 - born workers in a job has risen by 1.1million but only 153,000 among @entity14 but the speech sparked a storm of controversy , when it emerged @entity114 , @entity115 and home secretary @entity116 had all hired foreign staff as cleaners or nannies			1
mr @entity2 defended mr @entity83 , adding : ‘ he was saying the benefits of this , such as they are , tended to be in this group but not down at the bottom end , where they ’ve tended to see the problem			2
he ’s right in that by the way			0
‘ that is the issue			0
people that i deal with every day , they feel very squeezed by people who come in , under cut them in price			0
