@entity0 described his victory as ' one of the most important moments in my career ' as @entity6 moved five points clear of arch - rivals @entity8 in the race for a @entity11 place			1
@entity12 refused to write off @entity8 's chances of finishing in the top - four but could not under - estimate the value of a 2 - 1 victory after @entity16 struck twice			1
it was @entity8 's first @entity19 defeat in 13 games since they lost 3 - 0 at @entity21 in december			1
' we beat @entity8 again , ' said @entity12			1
' they were in fantastic shape and we beat them with the old weapons – with the pressure on the ball in the first half			1
@entity30 uploaded a dressing room photograph of @entity6 's post-match celebrations @entity16 scored twice to secure three important points for the @entity34 away at @entity35 ' now we are five points ahead of @entity8 , and six ahead of @entity37 and @entity38			1
to win in this moment is very important – one of the most important moments in my career			1
' but there are still eight matches to go			0
@entity8 can still be champions			1
when you are a top manager , or player or club – and @entity8 are – you have to deal with defeats			2
' we have also dealt with defeats			0
we lost at home to @entity54 and then we had to play against @entity37 and @entity8 , and you have to manage that			2
@entity8 can do that also because they have a great manager , great club , great fans			2
' @entity12 claimed that @entity6 had ' played @entity8 off the pitch ' in a one - sided first half , but struggled after @entity63 was sent of seconds after coming off the bench			1
@entity6 captain @entity65 ( second right ) is congratulated by @entity0 at full time @entity12 ( centre ) hailed his side 's performance as they moved five points clear of @entity8 in the league he added : ' it was the best first 45 minutes because in the second half we were not so good and that 's a little bit amazing because we played 11 against 10			1
it should be easier than the first half but it was not			2
' i know in a sense that @entity8 should press us and they did but we played them off the pitch in the first half and scored a fantastic goal and gave nothing away			1
' i came in the dressing - room and gave all my compliments because i was so happy , but then in the second half everything changed because of the red card			1
then we were n't playing like a team anymore			0
we were running with the ball and losing it unnecessarily			0
when we did n't have the ball we did n't press the opponent			0
that was different in the first half			2
' nevertheless , we did n't give many chances away			0
@entity30 has saved us a lot of times this season but i could n't remember one save in this match			0
' @entity16 , scorer of both @entity6 goals , was happy with his performance after the game , and admitted that the last few months have been difficult			1
@entity104 ( centre ) also posted a picture to @entity107 , alongside the caption : ' i 'm obviously disappointed to have lost today but we gave our best especially in the second half ' @entity63 was sent off soon after coming on , but @entity12 says it was harder to play against 10 men ' i think it 's my best game in a @entity6 shirt , yes			1
it 's a massive game , probably the biggest in @entity117 football , so to score two goals is great for me , ' @entity16 told @entity119			1
' the second goal has to be up there with my best			0
after @entity63 was sent off we needed a second goal because they pushed us to the end			2
' it was important for me			2
the last few months i 've not had the best moment			0
it is the manager who decides but i 'm happy today			0
' @entity12 was sufficiently impressed , but like @entity129 at @entity130 who preferred @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 in the three creative positions behind the lone striker , said @entity16 did not always fit into his formation			1
' now he is playing as a false right winger and the communication with ( @entity140 ) @entity139 and ( @entity142 ) @entity141 gives him more opportunities , ' @entity12 told reporters			2
' i think he was one of my most consistent players			0
i am not amazed , but i am very happy for him			0
' @entity16 's second goal of the afternoon was a stunning bicycle kick to put @entity6 2 - 0 up at @entity35 @entity148 struck on a new 4 - 3 - 3 formation when @entity8 lost at @entity6 , and @entity12 revealed that he had given his players the option to change from 4 - 3 - 3 and revert to a three - man defence as well			1
he said : ' @entity8 changed their system against us in the home match and then we played with three defenders at that time			1
we won 3 - 0			0
the coach continued with this system and they have won everything			0
and then we came again			0
we stayed with the system that we 've had the last four or five weeks			0
' we had to prove it against the system we usually play			0
i asked the players that we can play with three defenders or shall we continue with 4 - 3 - 3 ? but then you have to play like a team , and that i have seen in the first half			2
that was marvellous to see			0
