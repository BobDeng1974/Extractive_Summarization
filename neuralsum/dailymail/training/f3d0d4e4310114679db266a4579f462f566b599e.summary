published : 11:44 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 02:38 est , 9 may 2013 astronomers have called for help in finding ' space warps ' , rare system that bend light around them , acting as giant lenses			1
more commonly known as ' gravitational lenses , ' they create beautiful mirages , and help give clues to how dark matter helped form the universe			2
astronomers have now set up a special site where amateurs can scour images of the sky looking for the strange occurrences			1
this is called the @entity25 cross configuration bu astronomers visitors to @entity28 are given examples of what space warps look like and are shown how to mark potential candidates on each image			1
after identifying possible candidates in images , participants can discuss them via an online forum with other volunteers and experts , and create computer models of their discoveries			0
the final collection of space - warp candidates will be published for both amateur and expert astronomers to investigate further			2
anyone can participate in @entity48 project at the www.spacewarps.org site			0
' not only do space warps act like lenses , magnifying the distant galaxies behind them , but also the light they distort can be used to weigh them , helping us to figure out how much dark matter they contain and how it ’s distributed , ' said dr. @entity60 , co-leader of the project at the @entity62			1
the first set of sky images to be inspected in the project is from the @entity66 ( @entity68 - @entity67 - @entity69 ) legacy survey			0
' we have scanned the images with computer algorithms , but there are likely to be many more space warps that the algorithms have missed			1
' realistically simulated space warps are dropped into some images to train volunteers to spot them and reassure people that they are on the right track , ' said dr. @entity83 more , co-leader of the project at the @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , the @entity88			1
previous studies have shown that the human brain is much better at identifying lenses than current computer algorithms , and members of the public are as good at spotting astronomical objects as experts			2
this is a bright blue ' quasi-stellar object ' behind a massive galaxy : it has been lensed into two images , one on either side of the lens galaxy the image configuration in this case is a quad , with two images very close together ' even if individual visitors only spend a few minutes glancing over 40 or so images each , that ’s really helpful to our research -- we only need a handful of people to spot something in an image for us to say that it ’s worth investigating , ' said dr. @entity115 , another co-leader from the @entity62			0
following the @entity66 legacy survey , other surveys will also be using @entity48 as a means to find lens systems in their data			0
for example , the @entity121 led by the @entity123 and the @entity126 - @entity125 survey led by @entity127 are interested in collaborating with @entity48 , too .			0
