by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 19:36 est , 21 july 2013 despite the national obsession with cookery programmes , @entity2 cooks now spend just 38 minutes preparing the evening meal - down from an hour in 1980 and 100 minutes in 1960			1
what 's more , although @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 remain as popular as ever , a new survey looking at the national attitude to food found that more take inspiration from their parents ' culinary repertoire than from the efforts of tv super-chefs			1
more than half of those questioned said that their family was their biggest source of gastronomic inspiration , possibly because for six in 10 , their parents also taught them how to cook			2
@entity28 was less of a luxury in the 1960s , when one could spend more than an hour and a half cooking dinner the survey of 2,000 people found almost 60 per cent of women say they were inspired to start cooking by their parents , a third take ideas from their friends , one fifth from their grandparents and one in 20 are influenced by the recipes their children learn at school			1
men seek their inspiration from other sources , with more than a third using recipes from cookery books , one in five taking mealtime inspiration from travelling abroad and almost one fifth ( 17 per cent ) attempting dishes they 've tried in restaurants			0
but despite @entity2 's increasingly adventurous chefs , the sunday roast remains the nation 's favourite meal , with two thirds regularly reaching for the roasting tray			1
@entity60 also remains a popular choice although it was beaten into third place by @entity63 and was closely followed by another @entity2 classic - bangers and mash			2
@entity65 shared a picture of her evening meal on @entity68 in march but contemporary cooking is n't all about aping the older generation and tucking into classic dishes			2
20 per cent said they not only share their dinner with friends but also with online acquaintances by posting pictures of food on @entity68 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
social networking at suppertime increases to 50 per cent in the 18 - 24 age bracket , perhaps inspired by a-list food fans such as @entity65 , 25 , who shared a picture of a mammoth @entity86 supper in march on @entity68			0
although almost 40 per cent of us eat supper with other people , more than a quarter of @entity2 people read while they eat , whether the paper or on their kindle or @entity94 , while a quarter like to check their phones			0
the award for the most sociable diners goes to the @entity98 who sit down together seven times a week ( 45 per cent ) , while @entity101 , at the opposite end of the spectrum , are the loneliest diners , with one in 10 always eating solo			0
we cut cooking time so we can spend more time with family , do chores , go to the gym or watch tv the report also found that increasing numbers are looking for help and inspiration to cut down on the amount of time they spend preparing meals			1
on average , the main cook in the household spends 38 minutes in the kitchen preparing the evening meal , considerably less than 50 years ago			1
one in four claim they could n't live without bottled cooking sauces			0
women look for convenient cooking solutions in order to spend more time with family or to do chores ( almost 15 per cent ) , while 15 per cent of men want more time to go to the gym or watch tv			2
nevertheless , the survey also found a positive attitude to cooking , with 65 per cent of us admitting to enjoying food preparation , with many considering it a hobby rather than a chore			0
@entity2 's top three dinners are spaghetti bolognese , roast dinner and bangers and mash the oldest and youngest in society are the most enthusiastic when it comes to home cooking , with almost three quarters describing it as an enjoyable pastime			1
food historian @entity156 comments : ' as a nation , we 've embraced cooking as a hobby - having fun , sharing food and turning a meal into a social occasion			0
' a younger @entity164 generation has developed , and supper clubs where people pay to go out to dine in at someone 's home have emerged			0
' @entity170 , general manager at @entity171 which conducted the survey , said : ' the report sheds a light on the eating habits of the nation and has provided some interesting insight into the evolution of the dinner table and how our eating habits have changed over the past five decades			1
' as our lives become increasingly busy and time is considered a precious commodity , it 's clear from the research that we 're reaching for products we can trust to create great tasting enjoyable nutritious meals quickly and easily			2

the average time was an hour in 1980 and 100 minutes in 1960
despite the popularity of cooking shows , most cooks ape their parents
*traditional* roast dinner remains the @entity171 's favourite dish
