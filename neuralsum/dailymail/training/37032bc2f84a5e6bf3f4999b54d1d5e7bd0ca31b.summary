@entity12 was having a hair cut in @entity7 when a woman *approached* him
she told the undefeated world champion that she did not know who he was
she told @entity12 that she knew had heard of @entity35 , but not him
an *enraged* @entity12 shouts back : ' i need to @entity40 you ! '
he is the *highest* - paid *sportsman* in the world , making $ 105m from two fights
