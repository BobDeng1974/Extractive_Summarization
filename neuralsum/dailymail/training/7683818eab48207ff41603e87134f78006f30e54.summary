by @entity0 a migraine sufferer has banished the crippling headaches which once left her sick and incapacitated for days , using a high - tech headband which emits electrical pulses to the brain			1
the silver headband may look and sound like a prop form a sci - fi film			0
but @entity10 exists and the medical device is now available in the @entity12 , having relieved the painful symptoms of migraine sufferers across @entity15 and the @entity16 the non-invasive device claims to be free of any side - effects and works by applying neurostimulation to the nerves affected by migraine attacks			1
@entity22 , 26 , from @entity23 in @entity24 , told @entity25 the device has changed her life , easing her debilitating headaches in one day , after five weeks of treatment			1
@entity38 ( pictured ) wears the device for 20 minutes before going to bed and says that now her migraines clear in one day instead of three , and the intensity of the pain has reduced migraine sufferers are advised to wear the device for 20 minutes every day as a preventative measure or at the start of an attack to help to relieve the symptoms			1
in a recent study carried out on 67 patients across five centres in @entity52 , 38 per cent of people who used @entity10 reported getting migraines half as often			1
they could also take 37 per cent less medication each month			0
the @entity58 estimates that around eight million people in the @entity12 suffer from the condition , which can include severe headaches , nausea and vomiting , flashing lights and exhaustion			1
many sufferers struggle to hold down jobs or look after their families			0
currently there is no cure , with treatment usually limited to over the counter or prescription drugs , many of which have unpleasant side effects			2
it is a scenario ms @entity22 , 26 , an auditor , recognises only too well			2
‘ one of the worse things about having migraines is that , once you have tried all the drugs , done all the alternative therapies and kept a food diary , you are pretty much left to cope by yourself , ’ she said			0
most headaches and migraines involve the trigeminal nerve			2
its superior branch ends at the exit of the eye socket , underneath the skin of the forehead			0
an adhesive electrode is positioned on the forehead and @entity10 connects to this			2
@entity10 ( pictured ) is a silver headband that emits electrical pulses to the supraorbital nerve in the brain , to banish headaches			1
it has been used by migraine sufferers in the @entity16 and @entity15 and is now available in the @entity12 through the electrode , @entity10 generates precise micro-impulses in order to stimulate the nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve			1
neurostimulation of the trigeminal nerve produces a relaxing effect			0
regular repetition of this effect helps reduce the number of headaches and migraines , according to the company			2
‘ i had my first mild migraine when i was 12 and by my early 20s i was having three to four attacks a month , which included agonising headaches and being sick			1
sometimes the attacks merged into each other , lasting for days at a time			2
‘ i was put on to some quite serious drugs including @entity125 , which makes me feel exhausted and @entity126 which caused stomach upset			0
i also took @entity128 but none of the drugs really helped			0
‘ @entity131 made my life a misery			0
i lost endless working days and my friends got used to me cancelling social engagements			0
' holidays can be a nightmare			0
one particular attack in @entity16 was especially bad			1
luckily i have an understanding boyfriend - but all i wanted was a life without migraines			2
the @entity58 estimates that around eight million people in the @entity12 suffer from the condition , which can include severe headaches ( illustrated ) nausea and vomiting ‘ so when i heard about @entity10 i thought i had nothing to lose			1
‘ i started about five weeks ago and kept a record of my symptoms			1
i put it on for 20 minutes just before bedtime and it was very relaxing			1
‘ by week two the migraines were clearing in one day instead of dragging on for a few			2
the pain and intensity was also reducing			0
‘ by week four i had only had two migraines			0
i had n’t taken time off sick and my “ waking up headaches ” had gone			2
' i also felt more alert , able to concentrate and brave enough to stop taking @entity159			0
' in the last week i have not had any migraines at all			0
if someone had told me six months ago this would happen i would n’t have believed them			0
’ @entity164 of @entity165 , said : ‘ neurostimulation is proving to be an exciting development in the treatment of migraines and the research on the efficacy of @entity10 is so far positive			1
‘ we welcome any treatment which can add to the range of options available for the many numbers of people whose lives are blighted by migraine ’ @entity10 costs £ 295 and does not work for everyone , but there is a partial refund policy			1
users also have to pay £ 19.99 for disposable electrode pads which last around a month			0
neurologist @entity186 , a professor at the @entity187 , @entity52 , said : ‘ our research concluded that @entity10 helped around 40 per cent of patients			0
‘ this compares with a pharmaceutical success rate of 50 to 60 per cent - but @entity10 is almost entirely side effect free			1
‘ @entity10 is a useful first line treatment which may help around 40 per cent of patients to at least lessen their symptoms and the amount of drugs they have to take			1
if @entity10 does n’t work for them , then the patient should be managed with other treatments			2
’ ms @entity22 said : ‘ i know that @entity10 is n’t a cure for my migraines and that they may return			1
but for the first time in years i can see a light at the end of the tunnel			0
