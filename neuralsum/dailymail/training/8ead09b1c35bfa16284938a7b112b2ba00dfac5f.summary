read @entity0 and @entity1 on @entity3 's outburst even when it was spelt out to him , even when the conversation ventured into the history of slavery , @entity3 could not grasp what the problem was			1
he became confused , exasperated			1
‘ i do n’t know what all this is about , ’ he said on thursday			1
just as @entity13 ’s 77 - year - old owner could see no issue with appointing @entity15 as his new manager when the @entity17 remains the subject of an @entity20 investigation into allegations of racism , sexism and homophobia , he could not understand why anything he had said might also offend people			1
@entity3 in 2013 with the @entity27 after @entity13 stunned @entity28 at @entity29 @entity3 caused a stir over his appointment of @entity15 earlier this week his defence was one we hear all too often , even in 2014			1
he spoke the language of the bigot , arguing that there was no difference between abusing someone for being @entity39 and calling a white @entity41 person a ‘ @entity42 ’			1
i ’ve known @entity3 for years , and he once asked me to write his book			1
we got as far as writing a synopsis before i stood down as his ghost because i realised i did n’t have the time			1
but his life story was fascinating , and not just because he once declined an invitation to buy @entity50 for £ 11million because he feared football fans who did not follow @entity50 might boycott his sports stores			1
there was a story from his childhood during the @entity56			1
he jumped on a bus in @entity13 one day and asked a soldier sitting opposite him if he could hold his rifle			2
the soldier asked where he was getting off			2
he then asked which street he lived in			2
and then the number of his house			2
‘ @entity66 ? ’ asked the soldier			2
‘ yes ? ’ said young @entity3			1
‘ @entity66 , i ’m your dad , ’ said the soldier			2
the story highlights the fact that @entity3 is of a certain generation ; a man who has failed to evolve if we first assume that his comments are not motivated by racial hatred			1
i do n’t believe that they are			2
but what i do wonder is if this powerful and immensely wealthy man has ever had his views challenged before thursday night			2
@entity82 and @entity15 are the subject of an ongoing @entity20 investigation @entity85 ended their sponsorship deal with @entity13 over @entity15 ’s appointment there was nobody in his immediate circle strong enough to stop him pressing ahead with the appointment of @entity15			1
at first last night he had no recollection of even giving an interview to @entity95			2
‘ i ’ve not given an interview today , ’ he said			2
and then , when reminded of the anti-semitic remarks he is reported to have made , he replied : ‘ what the lad says was some @entity101 person liked money , and i said of course @entity101 people like money			1
jewish people are no different than us			1
’ there can be no disputing what he said in that car crash of a press conference at @entity13 the previous day			2
@entity3 described @entity15 as ‘ unlucky ’ and said he could see little wrong with the deeply offensive comments his new manager had made in a series of text messages and emails			1
i asked him if he realised the damage he had done			2
‘ @entity15 criticised somebody and called them a name , ’ he said			1
‘ we all get called names			2
we get called limeys , @entity128			0
the @entity129 get called jocks			0
and we do n’t take a blind bit of notice			0
’ i then asked him if he realised there was a distinction that needed to be recognised			0
‘ there ’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something i would never ever do or agree to , ’ he said			0
but did he understand why ? ‘ i would never even dream of that , ’ he said			0
‘ that is something that is totally taboo			0
everybody on the planet is equal			0
’ in 2011 @entity3 gave a radio interview saying black players were ‘ out of order ’ to complain when racially abused on a football pitch			1
he said he remembered the interview			0
‘ i believe we are all equal , ’ he repeated			0
still not convinced he appreciated why there was a difference between calling someone a ‘ limey ’ and racially abusing a black person , i raised the subject of slavery			0
he agreed slavery was ‘ wrong ’			0
i go to @entity159 a lot , ’ he said			0
‘ i have friends , black people , white people , everybody is the same			1
’ @entity15 was unveiled at a press conference at the @entity166 on wednesday how did he feel about a company terminating their sponsorship of @entity13 shirts ? ‘ i ’m sorry , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s a free world and they ’ve made the decision that they want to take			0
’ but was he not concerned he had damaged the reputation of a football club he has done so much to establish in the modern era ? ‘ i hope i ’ve not , because i have no intention of doing that , ’ he said			0
‘ but i think when it gets to the end of the season there may be a big change in attitude , even after a few games			0
@entity0 ’s august exclusives led the way over @entity15 , who was back at @entity13 on wednesday ' the man we have appointed , he ’s a very honest and open man			1
he ’s done something wrong			0
he ’s made the apology			0
let ’s forgive and forget			0
’ as @entity3 is about to discover , it is not that simple			1
there will be consequences and they could go way beyond joining @entity15 on an @entity20 charge			1
they could end with his legacy at @entity13 seriously damaged , and that would be a pity when i ’m not sure he will ever understand why			0
@entity15 could still face disciplinary action from the @entity20 we wish to make it clear the @entity20 investigation into the conduct of @entity15 and @entity82 remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by the @entity20 as to the outcome of this case			1
in the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case , the @entity20 would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation			0
the @entity20 did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-october			0
this came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information			0
the @entity20 is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place			0
this process inevitably takes time			0
both mr @entity15 and mr @entity82 are fully co-operating with the ongoing process			1
we fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter			0
however , it remains a complex investigation and the @entity20 will make no further comment at this time .			1
