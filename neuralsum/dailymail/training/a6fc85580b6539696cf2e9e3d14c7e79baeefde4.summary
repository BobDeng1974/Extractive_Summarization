a former magistrate who fractionally strayed over the white lines of a parking bay has condemned the ' petty ' £ 75 fine he was given			2
@entity4 , 65 , found the ticket on his @entity7 car after he left it marginally in a hatched area at a country train station			1
he claims he was forced to park slightly outside of the bay as a neighbouring @entity11 had left him with no room to get out of his car			1
' @entity15 ' fine : @entity4 said he was forced to park outside the lines by a neighbouring @entity11 he said he was not blocking any vehicles or exits and said the £ 75 penalty was ' petty '			1
mr @entity4 said : ' while i am the first to criticise people who park badly in car parks , on this occasion the cross-hatched area was not on a right of way or emergency access			1
' i could not see how i would be doing anything other than making use of a bay that would have otherwise been unusable			0
' as can be seen the area is in front of a lamp post and i left plenty of access to that			0
' it 's just petty			0
it 's not a good way to encourage people to respect the action they take			2
' mr @entity4 , a business mentor from @entity42 , found himself booked at @entity44 station in the village of @entity46 , @entity47			0
he successfully appealed against the penalty and car park operators have cancelled the fine			2
@entity4 said parking fines for infractions like his do n't encourage people to ' respect their actions ' an @entity56 spokesman said : ' our colleagues on the ground have the very clear brief that all cars parked outside of the bay lines must receive a penalty notice			1
' the appeals process allows the management team to review the image provided when the offence has taken place and gives us a second opportunity to assess each situation on a case by case basis			0
' with this in mind we have reviewed the image and are happy to cancel this penalty notice as a gesture of goodwill			0

@entity4 said *nearby* @entity11 forced him to park wide
the 65 - year - old said he was making good use of cross-hatched area
he said the fine was ' petty ' and does not encourage *social* *responsibility*
@entity56 cancelled the fine after seeing a *photo* of the parked @entity7
