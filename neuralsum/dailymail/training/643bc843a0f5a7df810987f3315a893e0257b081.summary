@entity1 scientist @entity0 has been given permission and assistance from @entity4 to search for the gold the @entity4 government is backing a bid by an @entity1 researcher to find a billion pound fortune in looted @entity11 gold in a lake near @entity13			1
legend has it that 18 crates of gold and platinum were dumped by an @entity20 squad in the @entity22 lake in @entity23 in the closing days of the @entity24 and lie in less than 50 feet of water			1
they were allegedly dumped in a secret operation codenamed ‘ @entity28 ’ after the vast treasure of the mythical @entity32 whose stories are told in @entity34 ’s opera cycle @entity35			0
the lake lies in what was former @entity4 and was the scene of frantic dives organised by the @entity41 secret police desperate for treasure to sell in order to buy much needed foreign currency			2
the treasure has a conservative value of around a billion pounds			0
but if it is there , it lies under at least six feet of lake - bottom sludge and the @entity1 team which arrived on its shores this week have brought along sophisticated sonar gear in a bid to locate it			1
the treasure belonged to @entity55 - @entity54 chief , one - time deputy to @entity57 and the greatest thief of the @entity11 - who stored it at his hunting lodge @entity61 50 miles north of @entity13			1
@entity61 was bedecked with some of the most beautiful treasures of @entity63 , stolen to order by @entity55 , but emptied in early 1945 as the @entity64 moved closer to @entity13 and blown up on his orders			1
to this day it is a magnet for treasure hunters who pour into the woods and ruins in unsuccessful attempts to find what they believe is missing loot still hidden in secret bunkers			0
witnesses said they saw @entity78 slave labourers being forced to dump up to £ 1billion of gold in the lake eighteen months ago a consortium of @entity83 businessmen expressed an interest to the @entity4 government of diving for it but nothing came of their expedition			1
according to eyewitness accounts from the time , @entity78 slave labourers assisted the @entity20 in dumping the gold into the lake and were then executed , their bodies weighted and then thrown into the water after the treasure			1
the search has been reignited after claims by a local priest , @entity99 , 79 , who has researched the legend of the treasure and who was a pastor near the lake during the @entity4 communist regime			1
' they did n’t have the technology in the @entity107 to properly examine the lake , ' he said			2
' but there are enough local people still around to know that the gold is there – and the bodies of the poor souls forced to dump it into the water			1
’ @entity117 , the chief of the @entity41 , believed in the story and won politburo approval for his search back in 1986			2
the hunt was codenamed @entity122 and grainy black and white photos exist of the search in the murky depths			0
the @entity1 team has been bolstered in its confidence of finding treasure from papers found in the @entity130 in @entity131			2
@entity20 documents together with post-war eye witness statements to the events on the lake in march 1945 , give credence to the theory that precious material was indeed dumped into the 400 - feet deep lake			2
the treasure belonged to @entity55 , pictured right , with wife @entity141 , left and @entity143 , who stored it at his hunting lodge @entity61 one witness , @entity147 , told a post-war allied commission : ‘ i remember well the night that lorries with slit headlights drove up to the lakeshore and i saw about 20 to 30 skeletal figures dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms being forced to unload heavy boxes			1
‘ these were put into two rowing boats which made six separate trips to the centre of the lake			0
‘ when the last case had been thrown overboard , the men returned to shore , were lined up and the last thing i saw were the flashes of the machine guns of the guards as they were killed			0
’ he said the bodies were then loaded back onto the rowing boats which were then taken out by the @entity20 to the centre of the lake and sunk			2
a third boat brought back the @entity20 men to the shore			0
@entity55 is alleged to have personally taken charge of numerous amounts of bullion from the national bank of @entity78 following the @entity11 invasion in 1939			1
it is this loot which allegedly lies in the @entity22			0
@entity1 scientists @entity0 , 59 , received permission and assistance from @entity4 for the searches which begin this week			1
he said : ' it is not just about the treasure but also about the people who it once belonged to			0
it is about putting things right			0
' his sonar equipment alone costs 50,000 pounds			0
dr. @entity193 , of the @entity23 state office for monuments , said : ' this is an expedition of extreme historical interest			0
