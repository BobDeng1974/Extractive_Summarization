the biggest , in 2008 , came in the midst of the financial crisis on the day after president @entity24 won his first term			1
post-election drop : this graph shows how significantly the drop the market has felt since the tuesday night election news the two - day slump came in the wake of @entity24 's re-election to a second term as investors turned their focus back to @entity38 's problems and the so - called fiscal cliff , a package of tax increases and government spending cuts in the @entity21 that will occur unless @entity43 acts by jan. 1			1
investors see it as a serious threat to the economic recovery			0

among the biggest fallers on @entity3 yesterday were banking shares , with @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 suffering big setbacks			1
although @entity64 was a solid @entity66 win in the election , the banks were big financial backers of @entity69 in the hope he might ease some of the onerous regulation imposed since the great panic of 2008 if he won			0
the fear is that unless @entity43 and the @entity77 can deal with the fiscal deadlock before january 1 then the automatic cuts would immediately trigger a recession potentially wiping as much as 2.5 per cent of output and leading to a sharp rise in the jobless rate			0
precipice : the @entity5 plunged 300 points stocks are still up on the year , but well below the peak they reached in september			1

' the mood of the market has certainly switched , ' said @entity109 , chief derivatives strategist at @entity110 , as investors monitor developments on the fiscal cliff and wait for more clues about @entity24 's agenda			2
investors were encouraged by two reports on the @entity21 economy that came out before the market opened			0
stocks initially opened up across @entity3 encouraged by figures from the @entity122 which reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell last week by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 355,000 - but fell as the morning progressed			1
pedestrians walk in the rain past the @entity128 : the markets in the @entity21 have endured an uncertain start to trading today one reason for this could be despite the good news from the @entity122 , officials did caution that the figures were more than likely to be distorted by @entity137 rather than a possible sign of a healing job market but despite the shaky start to trading on @entity3 , a separate report showed that the @entity21 trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level in almost two years as exports rose to a record high			1
the @entity5 climbed as much as 48 points in the morning but started to sink after the first hour of trading			1
the @entity5 fell steadily throughout the rest of the day , and more steeply in the last hour of trading			1
the @entity5 gave up 73 points in the last 40 minutes , accounting for more than half the day 's loss			1
the @entity122 reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell 8,000 last week to 355,000 , a possible sign that the job market is healing			0
officials cautioned that the figures were distorted by @entity137			0

@entity24 round two : ' the thinking before the election was that it would remove some of the uncertainty , but it seems to have done the opposite , ' said @entity52 , chief investment officer at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 it has been shaky running for the @entity21 markets since president @entity24 was re-elected @entity175 head @entity174 said financial market confidence ' has visibly improved ' as the 17 - country group that uses the euro struggles with its debt crisis			2
but he said the outlook for the economy remains ' weak			0
' mr @entity174 spoke after the bank 's governing council left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75 per cent			2
the @entity186 , the executive arm of the @entity187 , on wednesday slashed its outlook for growth for this year and 2013			2
the report helped set off a sharp decline in stocks in the @entity21 and @entity38			0
@entity194 's government said that it had met its financing needs for the year after raising the equivalent of $ 6.07billion in a series of bond auctions on thursday			1
