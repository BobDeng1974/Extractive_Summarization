by @entity0 the @entity2 sisters are both known for their glossy long locks			2
so it came as some surprise today to see that @entity6 has gone for a radical chop			2
@entity9 of @entity10 's younger sister , 30 , debuted her ' lob ' ( a long bob ) at the @entity14 summer party last night			1
she wore her hair loose and unstyled , lending her emerald green lace dress a relaxed feel			2
a cut above : @entity2 showed off her new ' lob ' hairdo at the @entity14 summer party last night new look : already the haircut is winning the seal of approval of top beauty experts and already the haircut is winning the seal of approval of top style experts			1
celebrity make - up artist @entity29 , who works with @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , was full of praise for the socialite 's new look			1
' i always think a good few inches chop makes hair look thicker and healthier , ' she told @entity39			2
' @entity6 's long locks were starting to look stringy so i like the new do ! this cut gives more structure to her cheekbones which looked a lot rounder with lengthier locks and i 'm loving the extra highlight she added to her make - up to accentuate them			1
@entity52 columnist @entity51 is also a fan of @entity6 's haircut , calling it ' edgy ' and ' more modern '			1
' i love her haircut ! ' she said			0
' it is edgy , it makes her look younger , and it means she has stepped out of @entity62 's rather " @entity63 " hair do shadow			1
time for a change : @entity6 pictured in september last year with her longer hair sibling likeness : @entity6 's previous long dark locks served to heighten her resemblance to sister kate pride and joy : @entity9 of @entity10 is regularly praised for her glossy brunette waves ' the big hair look is very old fashioned , and safe , and tends to drag down the face under its weight			1
unlike @entity62 's hair , which is layered , and has subtle highlights , @entity6 's cut is all one length , and all one colour , which is far more modern			1
' @entity6 's previous hairstyle only heightened the resemblance between her and her famous sister , so it may be the case that this new look is an attempt to carve a separate identity			1
indeed , @entity90 added : ' this new shorter style is a show of confidence , too			0
it shows she is going to plough her own furrow			0
' she would not be the first to go for such a hairstyle though			0
@entity97 and @entity98 both sport similar looks to great effect			0
and @entity101 went for a ' lob ' in february , finally parting ways with her famous mane			0
lob lovers : @entity98 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) both sport haircuts above the shoulder chop chop : @entity101 cut her hair in february ( left ) while @entity111 also wears shoulder - length locks ( right ) but , @entity113 suggests , @entity6 could benefit from a few layers as well as some new styling products to give the cut shape			0
' i do think she could benefit with a few shaggy layers in the front like @entity97 's , as @entity6 has a long forehead and this style draws focus to it , ' she explained			1
' or maybe adding a little more texture with some @entity125 or some volume using a product like @entity129 's new root lift spray			2
' and celebrity hair stylist @entity130 , of the @entity132 salon at @entity133 , believes @entity6 should take the cut even shorter , and try a fringe too			0
happy : @entity6 seemed in great spirits with her new hair ' i would be more adventurous and take her hair a little shorter at the back and do wispy bangs , ' he told @entity39			0
' this will make her look more current and will give her more options			0
right now , @entity6 's style is at an in - between stage and i believe that it is crucial that she has a true hairstyle that is effortless , sensual and casual			2
' @entity6 is a regular columnist for @entity149 and @entity150 , and published an entertaining book , celebrate , in 2012			0
she has been dating investment banker @entity152 , 36 , for 18 months			0
famous friends : @entity6 with @entity154 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right ) at the @entity14 summer party glamorous pair : @entity6 had dinner with her brother and his girlfriend @entity160 ( right ) after the @entity14 party			1
