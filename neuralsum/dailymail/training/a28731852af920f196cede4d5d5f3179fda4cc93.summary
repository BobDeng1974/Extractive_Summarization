when @entity1 and @entity2 were children , they cherished dreams of growing up to enjoy a career in professional football			1
and they loved these things : video : scroll down to see @entity12 's 10 most expensive @entity11 transfers no go : @entity1 and @entity2 failed to complete moves on deadline day because they could not agree personal terms with their prospective new clubs so if you could go and have a chat with 11 - year - old @entity1 or @entity2 , and suggest to them both that one - day they might turn down a move because they would n’t be paid £ 60,000 - a - week ( in @entity1 ’s case ) or £ 90,000 - a - week ( in @entity2 ’s case ) and they would think you were an idiot			1
they are players who , possibly under instruction from ‘ advisers ’ have chosen to put money before football			1
they are players who care more about the wages than actually playing the game			2
learn from the master : @entity1 could have benefited from playing under @entity36 at @entity37 they are players who have chosen to pick up money training all week , without the special feeling of playing in front of thousands of fans who have handed over heard - earned cash to watch them play			1
they are players who make you lose the faith in the beautiful game in this modern era			0
@entity2 ’s conduct has been bizarre at best			2
he was loved by @entity51 fans – guaranteed hero status after scoring a late winner in the @entity55 derby at the @entity56 and getting the first when the @entity58 hammered the @entity59 3 - 0 at @entity60 a few months later			0
the club , the manager and the fans all wanted him to sign for @entity51			0
it was all agreed , it was a no - brainer			0
except someone with no brains decided it would be a good idea to get greedy and see if more money could be had at @entity69			2
cult status : @entity2 became a hero at @entity51 during his loan spell at the club last season thankfully for @entity76 , chairman @entity75 has wised up to players and advisers taking his pants down so @entity2 was sent packing			1
@entity81 , meanwhile , took a 66 per cent pay cut to re-join @entity83 at @entity84			1
no hang on , @entity85 legend @entity36 , the kind of player - on his day - that @entity1 only wishes he could be , wanted him at @entity88			2
yet those talks ended up with @entity37 ‘ unhappy ’ , @entity1 out of the door , and the deal off			0
minutes later @entity92 said no , and @entity1 is left at @entity85 under a manager who was quite happy to let him go			0
all smiles : @entity81 was more than happy to take a large paycut to re-join @entity83 at @entity69 i ’m told @entity1 wants to play football			1
i ’m left asking , ‘ how much ? ’ @entity1 should be paying @entity36 for the education he would have received under him at @entity37			0
to learn from @entity36 should have been his priority , regardless of wages , and regardless of @entity92 stepping in late on			0
i still believe in the soul of football , i still believe most players love the game and playing more than they love money			1
but i also know there will be one or two players who let themselves down and forget that time of innocence when they were young boys who felt the joy and excitement of kicking a football			2
those guys are much poorer for losing that special feeling this beautiful game can bring .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 should put playing before money
both players had great *opportunities* to move on but put wages first
@entity81 should be used as an example after taking a pay - cut at @entity69
kicking a football
hearing the *ripple* of the net as they scored a goal
*pulling* a football shirt over their heads
a *sliding* *tackle* on a *wet* , muddy pitch
*celebrating* goals and *victories* with team - mates for school and club teams
just playing in a team
