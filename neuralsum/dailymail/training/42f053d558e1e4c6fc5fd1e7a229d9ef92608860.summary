by @entity1 reporter published : 10:56 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 02:23 est , 9 august 2012 stomach ulcers could have handed in their chips - thanks to the humble potato			1
scientists at @entity6 have discovered spuds contain unique antibacterial molecules that can treat the condition			1
members of the university ’s microbiology team now hope the substance , dubbed ‘ potato juice ’ could go into production as a daily diet supplement			1
potatoes contain unique antibacterial molecules that can treat the condition inspiration came as one of the department ’s scientists tucked into a spud for sunday lunch			2
it led to the discovery of a key molecule which could both cure and prevent the bacteria that lives in the stomach and causes stomach ulcers and heartburn			2
the discovery is one of many being made by scientists at the university as they try to develop the products and medicines of tomorrow			2
uniquely , unlike with antibiotics , the stomach bacteria can not develop resistance to the ‘ potato juice ’ which also does not cause any side - effects			1
scientists at the university even carried out the test on different types of potatoes - discovering @entity49 and @entity50 varieties worked the best			2
the process to extract the as yet unnamed molecule has now been patented , with hopes it could one day be sold as a supplement similar to probiotic yoghurt drinks			0
professor @entity57 was part of the team that made the molecule discovery @entity57 , professor of microbiology at the @entity63 , who worked on the discovery , said : ' one of our scientists was having sunday lunch when her boyfriend ’s grandma said they used to use potatoes to cure stomach ulcers			1
' afterwards she went and bought a bag of @entity75 from a shop on @entity77 and started testing them in the lab. ' when i first heard about the idea of using potatoes to treat stomach ulcers i have to admit i was a bit sceptical			0
but on another level i was n’t surprised - a lot of botanical products have very interesting compounds and we just have to find them			0
' we see this ‘ potato juice ’ as a preventative measure to stop stomach ulcers developing that people would take as part of a healthy lifestyle			1
it could be a huge market if we can get it developed			0
' the discovery of ‘ potato juice ’ is just one of a number of new medicines and treatments being developed by staff at the @entity6 ’s intellectual property department			1
staff there seek out companies from across the world to develop the university ’s inventions			0
business manager dr @entity111 said : ' it is really exciting to see these new discoveries - they cover all areas of science so it really keeps us on our toes			0
' as a scientist , the end goal of any work is to put something into the public arena which will benefit people			1
' we work to develop all the new technology that comes out of the university , by getting licensing agreements or forming spin - out companies			0
it ’s great to see years of research pay off with a new drug or product at the end			0
