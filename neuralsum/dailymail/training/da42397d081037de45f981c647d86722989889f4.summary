by @entity0 last updated at 7:19 am on 5th october 2011 global power : @entity2 said the new group could compete for influence with the @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 @entity2 has raised fears of a revival of the @entity10 after he revealed plans to create a so - called ‘ @entity12 ’ of former @entity10 nations			1
the @entity15 prime minister – who is all but certain to regain the presidency next year – wants the bloc to become ‘ one of the poles of the modern world ’ , and a rival to the @entity5 , the @entity19 and @entity7			1
in the past , mr @entity2 has lamented the collapse of the @entity10 in 1991 as the ‘ greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century ’			2
but he denies the @entity26 ’s proposed new alliance is an attempt to rebuild @entity15 ’s old communist empire			1
instead , mr @entity2 – who has effectively led the country for more than a decade , first as president and now as prime minister – claims the union would merely act as ‘ an efficient link between @entity6 and the dynamic @entity34 ’			2
his assurances will do little to convince some @entity37 nations , however , many of whom are already suspicious of the @entity26 ’s intentions			0
@entity41 , a political scholar , said the ‘ @entity12 ’ would become one of mr @entity2 ’s chief policies as president			1
he added : ‘ from the geopolitical viewpoint it represents an attempt to revive the @entity10			0
’ but announcing the plans in a @entity15 newspaper , mr @entity2 claimed : ‘ there is no talk about rebuilding the @entity10 in one way or another			1
it would be naive to try to restore or copy something that belongs to the past , but a close integration based on new values and economic and political foundation is a demand of the present time			0
’ empire - building : @entity2 has mourned the 1991 collapse of the @entity10 dominant : a map from 1986 shows the span of the @entity64 , which incorporates cities such as @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , which are now the capital cities of @entity69 , @entity70 and the @entity71 near collapse : three years later , however , the @entity10 's borders had retreated [ caption the concept of @entity76 , the huge area of land mass comprising @entity15 and some of its @entity6 and @entity79 neighbours , was first featured in @entity81 's dystopian fantasy 1984			1
under @entity81 's vision of a totalitarian dystopia after the @entity85 , the @entity82 falls into civil war and is integrated to @entity87 , a society ruled by the dictatorship of ' the party '			0
at the same time , the @entity10 annexed continental @entity6 and created the second superstate of @entity76			0
the novel 's third state , @entity94 is made of large regions of @entity7 and @entity96			0
the novel describes the story of @entity99 , who records how the world 's three superstates are constantly fighting for the unconquered lands of the world			0
@entity99 recounts the @entity104 fought in western @entity15 , @entity105 and @entity6 , and describes how ' the party ' referred to the postwar reorganisation of society as ' the revolution '			2
@entity15 , @entity110 and @entity111 have already formed an economic alliance to remove customs barriers between the countries , and now mr @entity2 is pushing for @entity115 and @entity116 to join , too			1
in january , the group will adopt unified market rules			1
he said : ‘ we are n’t going to stop at that and are putting forward an ambitious task of reaching a new , higher level of integration with the @entity12			1
‘ along with other key players and regional structures , such as the @entity19 , the @entity5 , @entity127 and the @entity128 , it should ensure stability of global development			0
’ but mr @entity2 ’s plans are likely to meet with fierce opposition from some of his prospective ‘ @entity12 ’ partners , who are far keener to forge closer ties with @entity6 than their old communist masters			1
last month @entity71 president @entity138 complained that the @entity26 was trying to coerce his country into joining the new customs union			0
and the @entity15 government has also caused tensions with @entity110 – one of its closest allies – after it tried to gain a huge stake in its top state - controlled industrial assets , a move @entity110 has strongly resisted			2
mr @entity2 served as @entity15 ’s president from 2000 to 2008 , when he was frequently accused of undoing the former communist state ’s transition to democracy			2
he only stepped down – to make way for his protege , @entity153 – because rules barred him from serving a third consecutive term			0
by becoming prime minister he has remained @entity15 ’s leader in all but name , and is likely to regain the presidency in elections next march			2
mr @entity153 has already proposed that he should run			0

proposed alliance between @entity15 and other nations could be ' one of the poles of the modern world '
unified market rules to be introduced between @entity15 , @entity110 and @entity111 next year
@entity2 seeking ' higher integration with the @entity12 '
