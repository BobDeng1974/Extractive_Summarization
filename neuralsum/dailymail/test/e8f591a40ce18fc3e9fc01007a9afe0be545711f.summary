tragic : @entity0 , 13 , and @entity1 , 14 , died after being struck by an express train the families of two teenage girls killed by a train at a level crossing have been shut out of a meeting where they planned to challenge @entity9 bosses over their bonuses and passenger safety			1
@entity0 , 13 , and @entity1 , 14 , died when an express train hit them at @entity14 station , @entity15 , in december 2005 as they set off on a @entity18 shopping trip			1
the friends had been using the station ’s unlocked footpath crossing to catch a service to @entity23 when they were struck by a through train bound for @entity25			2
an inquest returned verdicts of accidental death – but it later emerged that crucial safety reports had not been disclosed to the coroner , leading to allegations of a cover - up			0
@entity9 was subsequently convicted of criminal negligence and fined £ 1 million over the deaths			1
however , campaigners say too many dangerous crossings still exist in rural areas – despite a @entity9 closure programme – and that ‘ excessive ’ bonus payments to executives totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds are not justified			2
the girls ’ parents had planned to raise their concerns at a meeting in @entity46 last week organised by @entity9 ’s @entity47 , a watchdog whose role is to hold the taxpayer - funded body to account			1
however , their request to attend was turned down			0
last night the girls ’ fathers , @entity53 and @entity54 , said in a statement : ‘ bonus payments were made to @entity9 executives even after failures in regard to safety at level crossings , resulting in many deaths , including those of our daughters			2
‘ we had hoped that members would challenge @entity9 on these issues and ensure action to improve safety at level crossings is speeded up			2
the @entity9 governance structure is seriously flawed and not fit for purpose			0
’ @entity9 , which receives a £ 4 million annual subsidy from the taxpayer , does not have shareholders			1
instead , its activities are scrutinised by a panel of about 30 individuals , appointed by independent assessors for three - year terms			0
fatal accident site : @entity0 , 13 , and @entity1 , 14 , were fatally struck @entity14 station , @entity15 , in december 2005 last year , chief executive sir @entity82 , who has since left the company , saw his basic £ 591,425 salary boosted by a £ 67,919 bonus , while network operations chief @entity86 , who has also left , received a £ 47,641 bonus on top of his £ 380,275 salary			1
in total , the firm ’s bosses received £ 250,000 in bonuses last year			1
a @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ the tragedy at @entity14 was a watershed for this company and the way it approaches safety at level crossings , and members of the families have played a pivotal role in this			0
as a result … level crossings in @entity107 are among the safest in @entity109 , but there is still much that can , and will be done to make them safer still			0
’ @entity113 , co-ordinator of the @entity114 , said : ‘ the decision not to invite the families to the workshop was … in no way influenced by @entity9			0
the members are independent but their role is limited and they are not involved in the day - to - day running of the company			0
