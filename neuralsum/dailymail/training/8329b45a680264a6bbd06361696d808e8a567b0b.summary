by @entity1 reporter like every fad , the @entity3 dance craze that became the most successful @entity5 video has had it 's day			0
but it seems that the cult dance from @entity10 rapper psy that inspired countless parodies is still being recreated by one loyal fan - a @entity15 brown bear			1
@entity17 photographer @entity16 captured the cub 's movements in @entity20 in june			1
happy feet : the brown bear cub stand up on his hind legs and crosses his arms to adopt rapper @entity26 's signature pose uncanny : despite living in a @entity20 swamp , the young bear recreates the dance craze with alarming accuracy			1
his siblings look more interested in the plants around them and his mother looks unamused mr @entity16 watched in amazement as the cub stood on his hind legs , pranced around and banged his wrists together			1
walking across a swamp with his mother and two siblings , the cub burst into action , despite his family 's withering looks			0
the single - minded cub continued to prance around on his own in an uncanny recreation of @entity26 's energetic moves			0
mr @entity16 , from @entity50 , said : ' these images were taken during a long night spent in a photographic hide in northern @entity20 in late june , where i was leading a photographic trip			0
' this summer there were a couple of @entity15 brown bears with families of small cubs visiting this swamp area throughout the night			2
going solo : @entity16 captured the cub in a remarkable moment when he looks directly at the camera and prances around @entity65 ? the cub has a bashful moment as he pivots around and turns his back on his unappreciative family ' the cubs are always playful and cheeky but this particular youngster seemed to have a great delight in standing up and practicing his moves			2
' normally standing up like this is to help them see potential danger at a distance ( their eyesight is not particularly good generally ) but this youngster had other ideas , and my client sharing the hide commented that it reminded him of the @entity3 of dancing ! ' looking through the sequence of images he had begun a bit shyly with his back to us , then had another go side - on and once he was happy tried once again for his mum and siblings to see - unfortunately all he got was a disapproving look from mum and the rest of the family carried on eating ! ' movement wise he was moving from side to side , one foot to another and it was this along with the positioning of his front paws that really drew the @entity3 analogy to mind			0
' copycat : parodies of the @entity10 dance , which was released in july 2012 popped up all over the world as it surpassed 1 billion hits capturing the moment : wildlife photographer @entity16 was on a hide near the swamp when he saw the family and it 's star performer walk towards him			2
