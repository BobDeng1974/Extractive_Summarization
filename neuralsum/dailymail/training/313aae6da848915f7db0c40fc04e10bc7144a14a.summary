@entity0 drove immaculately through the gloom of @entity2 to become the most successful one - lap @entity3 in history , ahead of sunday 's @entity5			1
the @entity8 man 's third pole position in four races took him to 34 in total , eclipsing the legendary @entity11 , and into the top four on the all - time list , behind @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
' it 's great to be up there with the great names , ' said @entity0			1
' i 'm very proud of that , but it 's only qualifying			0
' only qualifying , yes , but the pole position had added piquancy because of the simmering tensions between the @entity8 and @entity40 teams			1
before qualifying @entity52 , @entity8 ' @entity53 chairman , took a cake he had brought from @entity55 into the @entity40 hospitality area as a peace offering , after his team mounted an aggressive campaign to have them banned from this and the next three races for a fuel irregularity in @entity63 last month			2
wet : @entity65 's @entity64 drives past the grandstand with the water building up on the side of the track intent : a focused @entity0 peers out of his visor as he prepares to go out in qualifying but @entity73 , @entity40 's motor racing consultant , threw the delicacy away			2
he instead joked that @entity52 should wear a bullet - proof vest if he ever came back to their paddock home			0
@entity52 was made aware of @entity40 's dismay when they contacted him directly after seeing the 95 - page dossier @entity8 submitted to the @entity84 court of appeal hearing , which sat last monday			2
the judges found against @entity40 and ordered them to pay the costs but rejected @entity8 ' call for a harsher punishment			0
fourth : @entity89 was unable to mount a serious challenge when he spun on the final lap second fiddle : the @entity93 had to settle for another qualifying session behind his team - mate @entity0 's team - mate @entity89 was fourth fastest after a lock - up on his penultimate lap and then , pushing hard , spun on the last corner of his final lap. that means @entity0 is well - placed to supplant @entity89 in the drivers ' standings from 11 points behind			1
@entity40 's resurgence after a torrid few months is testament to the strength of their team			0
the aerodynamic qualities of their @entity109 afforded plenty of grip in the wet conditions			0
sadly for them , rain is not forecast for sunday			0
struggle : @entity116 could n't make it into @entity118 in his @entity119 and will start from 12th place better : @entity121 contemplates what may have been as he will start the race from fifth place full on : @entity126 ' driver @entity125 drives down the straight on the @entity2 circuit regret : @entity119 's @entity130 looks rueful after he could n't make it into @entity118 teamwork : @entity15 's @entity40 is quickly pushed back into the pits between sessions water : @entity137 driver @entity136 produces spray as he rockets around the track			1

@entity0 claimed his 34th *career* pole in @entity2
the @entity8 man was six tenths quicker than @entity23
@entity89 spun as he tried to *snatch* pole back from @entity0
@entity116 will start 12th as both *mclarens* failed to progress from @entity150
