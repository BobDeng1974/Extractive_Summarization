by @entity0 published : 20:26 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 20:47 est , 5 december 2012 bitter row : @entity2 has reignited his bitter feud with son @entity4 @entity4 ’s father - in - law reignited their bitter war yesterday by demanding the @entity8 shut down the chef ’s global empire			1
@entity2 lodged a petition to ‘ wind up ’ @entity12 , which owns all his restaurants and media ventures			1
@entity2 claimed he was taking the drastic action in pursuit of a ‘ significant unpaid debt ’ – understood to be £ 2million @entity4 offered to pay him in february to settle the vicious feud ripping the company and family apart			1
he also alleged he was acting because the tv chef was facing a ‘ tax investigation ’ by @entity24 – a claim which @entity4 ’s camp believe is designed to smear him			0
@entity4 is understood to be confident the court will dismiss all @entity2 ’s demands , if it even reaches the stage of a hearing			2
the once - close pair fell out in 2010 and hostilities have grown increasingly severe			0
@entity4 , 46 , accused @entity2 – the father of his wife @entity33 and former chief executive of the @entity4 empire – of hacking into private emails and plundering £ 1.4million to finance his womanising			2
@entity2 , who denied the claims , branded @entity4 a fame - obsessed ‘ monster ’ and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages			1
@entity4 ’s wife , 38 , sided with her husband and severed ties with her parents after discovering her philandering father had kept a second family secret from her for 30 years			0
in february this year , a truce was called and both sides withdrew civil litigation			0
@entity4 is believed to have agreed to pay £ 2million to @entity2 , which included a payment for a 30 per cent shareholding in @entity12			2
but yesterday full hostilities were resumed as @entity2 accused @entity4 – whose annual income was recently estimated at £ 24million – of failing to pay up			0
chef @entity4 and his wife @entity33 the @entity8 in @entity57 confirmed a ‘ petition to wind up ’ @entity12 had been lodged by @entity2			1
a hearing at the @entity60 has been scheduled for january 21			0
presenting a winding - up petition to the court is the most serious debt recovery action that can be taken by someone claiming to be a creditor			1
@entity2 will be required to demonstrate he has an unpaid debt that is not in dispute , something @entity4 ’s camp suggest he will be unable to do			1
technically , if a judge sided with @entity2 , the court has the power to order the compulsory liquidation of the @entity4 empire , which includes 24 restaurants around the world			2
however , it is more likely the matter will be resolved before that stage			0
yesterday @entity2 ’s solicitor , @entity80 , said : ‘ i can confirm that a statutory demand has been filed with respect to mr @entity4 and a winding up petition against @entity12 in relation to a significant debt which is now due to our client mr @entity2			1
’ a source close to @entity4 confirmed there was a tax investigation , but suggested it related to the time when @entity2 was chief executive of the company			0
a spokesman for the chef said the winding - up petition had been published ‘ maliciously ’ , adding : ‘ there are valid reasons why the purported debt has not been paid which has nothing to do with @entity12 ’s solvency or ability to pay			2
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
