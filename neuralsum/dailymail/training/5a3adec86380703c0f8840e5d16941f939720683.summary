by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 15:15 est , 21 january 2014 angry road safety and motoring groups have criticised @entity5 ’s first controversial new £ 1million pub on the @entity6 which opens today amid fears it could raise the risk of drink - driving			1
the @entity11 said it was a ‘ risky and frankly unnecessary move ’ that was ‘ at odds with common sense ’ while road safety charity @entity13 said it represented ‘ a potentially deadly temptation to drivers			1
’ pub chain @entity20 said its @entity22 bar and restaurant will be open from 4am to 1am , seven days a week , in the @entity24 at junction 2 of the @entity6 in @entity26 , @entity27 creating 120 jobs			1
it will sell real ale from local and regional brewers as well as hot drinks			0
but the controversial plans have alarmed safety campaigners concerned about the added risk of drink - driving after the new establishment had its 24 - hours license approved in june 2013 by the @entity50			1
@entity51 , campaigns officer for national road safety charity brake said : ‘ the opening of a pub on a motorway is a serious concern , presenting a potentially deadly temptation to drivers			2
‘ drink driving remains one of the biggest killers on our road , causing devastation to families and communities every day			1
’ mr @entity51 added : ‘ it is vitally important that messages about the dangers of drink driving are as strong and obvious as possible , so drivers know it 's not okay to stop off for a quick drink on their way home			1
our advice is not to have a drop if you are driving			2
’ @entity78 , head of external affairs at the @entity11 whose own poll of motorists showed widespread opposition to the idea of pubs on motorways , said : ’ the public appear to be very much against the introduction of motorway pubs			2
' we appreciate the vast majority of motorists drive responsibly and that alcohol is already available in shops at motorway services , but for many this decision seems to be at odds with common sense			2
stop - off : the £ 1.2million @entity22 pub - which will create 120 jobs - will be open from 4am to 1am , seven days a week , in the @entity24 ( pictured ) at junction 2 of the motorway ' in our view this is a risky and frankly unnecessary move			1
the question we are struggling to answer is : of all the places to open a pub , why choose a motorway service station ? ’ mr @entity78 added : ’ the temptation to drink and drive can only be increased by easier access to alcohol			1
we therefore urge @entity20 to do all they can to convey the anti-drink - driving message as strongly as possible at this particular pub. ’ but @entity20 's said they are keen to prove they are doing all they can to prevent drink driving			1
' the opening of a pub on a motorway is a serious concern ' @entity51 , @entity13 they will include the national @entity126 logos on menus and remove all alcoholic promotional deals			0
manager of the @entity6 branch , @entity129 said : ‘ myself and my team are looking forward to welcoming customers into @entity134			1
" he said the pub ‘ primarily serves the motorway users , but its facilities are also available to the surrounding community from the local road network			0
’ the @entity11 ’s own research showed just one in eight ( 12 per cent ) of people supported the decision to put pubs into motorway service stations			0
of the 2,000 people surveyed , more than six out of ten ( 64 per cent ) opposed such a move			0
older drivers being less accepting to the sale of alcohol at a motorway pub than their younger counterparts			0
the research found that only one in 12 ( 8 per cent ) of those aged over 55 were in favour of pubs being opened at motorway services while seven out of ten ( 71 per cent ) were against			0
in the younger 18 to 34 age range as many as one in sex ( 18 per cent ) supported the move and only just over half ( 52 per cent ) disagreed			0
nearly a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of everyone questioned said they were undecided on the issue			0
road : the pub is split over two floors and licensed to serve alcohol from 9am			0
the @entity6 motorway is pictured doctors and motoring groups said a motorway pub sent out the ‘ wrong message ’			1
professor @entity176 , director of the @entity11 , said : ' last year it was revealed that the number of drink - drive deaths had risen by a quarter to 290			1
' given this background does opening a pub at a motorway service station send the right message about road safety ? ' people will probably be stopping off and using the loo and having a meal , but the temptation is there to have a drink			1
i ’m very disappointed and i just can not understand it ' @entity193 , @entity194 ' the majority of motorists are sensible but people would be forgiven for thinking the official line from ministers is now take a break and have a pint			2
’ sir @entity202 , @entity203 special adviser on alcohol and chair of the @entity207 , said he was ‘ disappointed ’ by the decision to open a @entity20 on the @entity6 : ’ we are trying to prevent harm from alcohol - related traffic accidents and this sends out completely the wrong message			1
‘ the appearance of bars on our motorway network adds greater urgency to the @entity207 ’s call for a fundamental review of licensing laws , focusing on the availability of alcohol and reducing alcohol - related harm			2
' public health should be a core licensing objective , and the impact on the health of local people must be a key consideration			0
' an @entity230 survey found more than two thirds ( 68 per cent ) of drivers were opposed to bars on motorway service areas serving alcohol			0
@entity230 president @entity236 , @entity230 said : ‘ two thirds of drivers are opposed to bars or shops serving alcohol on motorway service areas			0
' some fear that the fact that alcohol is served in areas mainly only accessible to drivers and their passengers may tempt some drivers to have ‘ one for the road ’			0
our advice is always that if you are going to drive , do n’t drink , and if you are going to drink , do n’t drive			2
‘ perhaps pubs setting up close to motorways should offer free non-alcoholic drinks to drivers to show that they have a genuine concern for road safety			0
