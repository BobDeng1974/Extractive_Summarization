click here to read @entity2 's chief sports writer @entity1 's full report of the match from the @entity5 even when @entity8 was at his masterful best , pulling the strings on his 33rd birthday , @entity7 ’s supporters stayed true to their team			1
in the end , they got a remarkable reward			0
much has been made of the sterile atmosphere and yet the place was bouncing after @entity18 ’s brilliant hat - trick			1
when the @entity5 is like this , you want the good times to roll for this team			2
they are a special group of supporters when they get behind their team			0
‘ we fight to the end ’ they sang throughout this extraordinary clash with @entity28 ’s side and somehow emerged victorious			2
@entity18 flashes his abs in celebration after claiming the victory for @entity7 city players pile on @entity18 as they clinch a 3 - 2 comeback win over the @entity37 giants @entity18 ’s winner was something else , a throwback to the days when @entity7 ’s disbelieving fans were on the road to their first @entity44 title in 2012			1
more of this , please			0
all that was missing when @entity18 sealed this incredible comeback was the @entity48 , the celebration that followed some of the most dramatic moments in @entity7 ’s recent history			1
it cranked up the volume , sending @entity7 ’s supporters happy as their uneasy relationship with @entity59 football ’s elite competition continues its journey			2
there is still a long way to go before they can match the special atmosphere on the @entity65 on those special @entity59 nights , but this was a start			0
@entity18 slots a penalty to give @entity7 the lead after he was brought down after 20 minutes @entity18 celebrates his successful spot - kick as @entity7 went 1 - 0 up against the run of play the @entity75 powers his spot - kick beyond the outstretched hands of @entity79 keeper @entity78 by the time they sang ‘ @entity87 ’ at the end , in the moments when he was walking off the field after his last minute substitution , this place was rocking			1
despite the top four finishes , the two @entity44 titles in three seasons , @entity7 have n’t quite taken to this competition			2
still , the marketing bods tried to do their bit here			0
before the teams walked out of the tunnel at the @entity5 a few lads opposite the main stand began waving giant blue and white chequered flags in an effort to drum up an atmosphere			0
it still feels like a long time before they will cross the finishing line in the @entity103			1
city fans chanted ' @entity87 , @entity87 ' in appreciation for @entity18 as their hero is substituted in the 94th minute fans united to say ' no matches behind closed doors ' in response to @entity112 's punishment for racist incidents that have seen them suffer in silent stadiums also the @entity79 fans got their wish initially as they supported their side but could n't predict the final outcome they should be relishing these nights - putting their spat with @entity122 over their £ 50m fine for breaching @entity124 regulations behind them - and getting on with the business of the day			1
@entity79 are one of the biggest tickets in town right now , what with their poster boy team and a coach who would look at home on the cover of @entity135			0
@entity79 were down to 10 men following the dismissal of central defender @entity138 in the 20th minute for a foul on @entity18 inside the area			1
@entity18 put them ahead , but @entity79 - who completed 664 passes compared with @entity7 ’s 444 - were still by far the more accomplished side			1
their fans , were fresh from the pop - up bars in city centre hotels providing them with litres of @entity148 to down in the hours before kick - off , made a right racket in the @entity151			2
at the final whistle they drowned their sorrows			0
@entity79 celebrate the goal from @entity8 's clever free - kick which gave them a 2 - 1 lead going into half - time @entity159 remonstrates with his side after @entity79 take the lead with @entity8 's strike they had stood for the full 90 minutes and urging @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 to pull this out of the bag			1
they got their wish , pretty much as we always knew they would			0
those fans are a credit to their team , up there with the best behaved and most humorous travelling supporters in the sport			0
they were in raptures five minutes before the break , lifting their red and white @entity79 scarves above their heads to celebrate @entity8 ’s clever free - kick			2
then , just before the @entity182 referee @entity181 stopped for half - time , @entity165 got in between @entity159 and @entity184 to head them in front			1
@entity188 celebrates as @entity7 's come - from - behind win keeps their @entity103 dream alive @entity79 boss @entity28 can barely watch as the game slips away from his stars there had been brief moment of unity before kick - off , when supporters from both teams held up bright orange banners demanding ‘ no to football behind closed doors ’			1
correctly , both clubs believe they have been punished by @entity122 ’s decision to order @entity112 to play home games behind closed doors because of a racist incident			0
still , the biggest crime here was just how @entity79 will return to @entity208 without , at the very least , a draw			0
when @entity18 scored the the equaliser it was bedlam in the stands and it was then that this stadium , fans included , mustered everything they had			2
when he scored the winner , it felt like @entity218 all over again .			0

@entity7 defeated @entity79 3 - 2 in comeback at the @entity5
@entity18 's hat - trick brings @entity7 's @entity103 campaign to life
city fans ' singing of ' we fight to the end ' was proven right by full - time
all that was missing was the @entity48 celebration as they clinched victory
