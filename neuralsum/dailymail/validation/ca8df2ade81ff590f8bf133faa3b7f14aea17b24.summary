@entity6 was diagnosed with a rare spinal disease six weeks *ago*
doctors said she needed to recover quickly or she would never walk again
the 15 - year - old from @entity22 , @entity1 started running again recently
could be *due* to another disease in her brain which *hastens* recovery rates
doctors say she could have multiple sclerosis if the rare symptoms return
