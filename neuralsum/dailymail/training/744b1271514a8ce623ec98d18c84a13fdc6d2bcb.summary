as fireworks lit up the heavens above the @entity3 opening ceremony , watched by around a billion people , something else was seen among the whizz - bangs in the night sky ... a @entity8			1
it may have ticked all the cliche boxes - saucer - shaped , bulge in the middle , metallic - but no one has yet stepped forward to explain the slow - moving object			0
the incident came right at the close of last friday 's spectacular at the @entity19 stadium in @entity20 , east @entity21 at around 12.30am			0
and it was just as @entity23 , one of the @entity25 ’s top @entity8 experts , predicted only weeks ago - that mass summer events would be a prime time for crafts from other worlds to present themselves to mankind			1
but while @entity3 - a division of @entity46 - has picked @entity48 blimps for all of its 2012 @entity3 aerial coverage , the object does not look like one of the floating airships			2
some commentators on @entity53 believe it is actually a helicopter - or simply a fake			2
mr @entity23 , who worked at the @entity56 for 20 years , investigated reports of @entity58 between 1991 and 1994			1
one theory is that the object was a blimp or helicopter used to gather aerial footage aliens may be visiting @entity64 for military reconnaissance , scientific research , or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some tourism here are some of the theories regarding the @entity8 ... he began his research as a sceptic , before becoming convinced that the sightings raised important defence issues for national security and air safety			1
speaking earlier this month , he said : ' it has been a widely held belief in @entity56 circles that " aliens " have been able to detect us for decades via tv and radio broadcasts			2
' what once seemed like science fiction is steadily being realised by central governing bodies as distinctly real			0
' if aliens have studied our psychology , they may choose to appear in our skies on a significant date			2
' the closing ceremony of the @entity93 is one date being widely circulated by conspiracy groups			1
’ the footage is believed to have originated from a web user known as ' @entity98 '			2
@entity8 expert @entity23 ( above ) predicted the @entity99 would be a prime time for extraterrestrials to make an appearance @entity103 and the ' @entity8 cover - up ' two weeks ago , it was revealed that former prime minister @entity103 received a briefing about ufos from the @entity56 because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on alien life - forms			1
@entity112 requested the advice for the pm in 1998 as the @entity115 was being introduced , which allowed the public to obtain information on alien mysteries			0
ex-pm @entity103 received a briefing about ufos from the @entity56 because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on extraterrestrials mr @entity103 's concerns were raised after he received a letter from a member of the public referring to a ' cover - up ' and asking him to make @entity8 reports and other information available			1
according to @entity129 , mr @entity103 sought advice from the @entity56 for its policy on the issue			0
he was told by staff at the ministry that it has ' only a limited interest in @entity8 matters ' but that they ' remained open - minded ' about ' extraterrestrial life forms '			1
details of the briefing emerged ahead of a release of files on july 12 by the government of more than 6,700 pages detailing seemingly close encounters with ufos over the last 30 years			0
among a series of @entity8 sightings in the files is a policeman 's report of a mystery cluster of lights darting across the sky during an @entity155 replay between @entity156 and @entity157			1
the mounted officer 's claims to have seen the bright object hovering over @entity160 in march 1999 for almost 15 seconds , slowly changing shape , were corroborated by a colleague			0
the ‘ credible witness report ’ is one of a series investigated by the @entity56 , whose top - secret files are being released in sections by the @entity168 following the closure of the ministry ’s @entity8 desk in 2009			1
one confidential 1995 report by the defence official responsible for manning the desk says the presence of extra-terrestrial lifeforms is ‘ possible ’ , although there is ‘ no direct evidence ’			0
it also speculates on the reasons why aliens may be visiting @entity64 , including for military reconnaissance , scientific research , or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some tourism			0
the policeman claimed that he saw something ‘ unlike anything i ’ve seen before ’ at @entity160 while @entity157 beat @entity156 2 - 0 in the @entity155 quarter final replay he said a ‘ square to almond shape ’ yellow object with four lights floated silently above his horse			0
another file describes a @entity197 hotelier who saw a @entity8 landed in a field			2
two ‘ faceless humanoids ’ in silver suits emerged and took measurements			0

@entity8 expert @entity23 predicted aliens would appear at the @entity93
possibly a blimp or helicopter gathering aerial footage
