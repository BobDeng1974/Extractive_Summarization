the video features a smiling @entity0 perched on his bed holding up yellow cards asking for support			1
he said : ' hello i 'm @entity0			0
i 'm five - years - old and i love @entity53 , @entity54 and yellow			0
' i 'm in hospital , i was born with no immune system , and i need a second bone marrow transplant			1

are you going to join in ? ' post a picture of you wearing yellow to @entity34 , @entity33 or @entity35 with # wearyellowforseth			0
' mrs lane , a full - time mother - of - two , said : ' we never meant to start any sort of campaign , and only expected friends and family to join in			0
' i ca n't believe it has taken off like this			0
the condition , known as ' bubble disease ' requires sufferers to live in a sterile ' bubble ' ' i do n't think there is a single country in the world that has n't got someone who has got involved			0
' it all helps show @entity0 that people are thinking of him			1
i told him about the views and he asked , " is it more than 20 ? ' i said " yes it is " and he said " wowee "			0
' @entity0 was admitted to hospital at the age of six months with an extreme chest infection			1
his parents were told he had severe combined immunodeficiency			1
known as ' bubble boy disease ' it is caused by a mutated gene and means the body 's antibodies can not respond to infections , leaving sufferers extremely vulnerable to germs			0
he was transferred to @entity108 where he had a bone marrow transplant from donor umbilical cord cells			1
but he was kept in a ' bubble ' - unable to interact with children , go to nursery or play outside in parks - for two years while his body got stronger			0
mrs @entity116 , who has a five - month - old son @entity117 with her husband , @entity118 , 31 , said : ' he had no contact with other children until he was two - and - a - half			2
' we would go out in the pram and i would have to put the rain cover over him with a little fan inside - people probably thought i was mad			0
' but after just a couple of years of normality - after @entity0 had started school and made his first best friends - his body turned on him in october			2
when he had his transplant as a baby he developed graft versus host disease - where his donated cells saw his own body cells as foreign and attacked them			0
a first bone marrow transplant failed , when his immune system turned on him			1
it means @entity0 is now confined to his hospital room once more , waiting for a second transplant his father @entity143 is set to be @entity0 's donor , and doctors are waiting until the five - year - old is well enough before performing the operation @entity0 's parents recorded an adorable video of him holding up screen cards , appealing for people to wear his favourite colour , yellow , to show their support			1
it has so far been viewed by more than two million people initially , it only affected his skin - leaving him with painful red patches - but in october it turned on his own bone marrow , once again wiping out his entire immune system			1
@entity0 returned to his ' bubble ' - an ultra-hygienic single room at @entity164 's @entity163 - in a bid to keep him free from potentially lethal infections , in january			2
' if i 'm a bit run down and have a coldsore i ca n't touch him , ' said mrs @entity116			0
' and if we have a cold we ca n't go in at all			0
' everything has to be sterilised and his room has filtered air			0
the staff are scrupulous with cleaning			0
' nothing can leave the room once it has come in and been cleaned , his soft toys are washed at 60 degrees every couple of days and his bed sheets are boil washed every day			0
' @entity118 is with him all the time so his clothes have to be washed at 60 every day and @entity0 has never been out the room			2
' his father - who will be a donor for @entity0 once he is well enough - recorded the video of @entity0 last week			1
in just six days it has attracted 2,483,855 views and hundreds of thousands of people have messaged mrs lane to say they are planning on wearing yellow			0
it is thought @entity0 will have his transplant in around six weeks , but will probably have to remain in near - isolation for around a year after the operation			2
' it 's hard for him , and he is getting bored , but he never complains and he understands , ' said mrs @entity116			0
after his operation and around a year in a sterile environment , @entity0 's parents hope he will be able to play with his friends and little brother again			1
