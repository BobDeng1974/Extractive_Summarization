by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor the dead will have to be dug up and reburied in deeper graves because @entity6 's cemeteries are almost full , mps have claimed			1
a shortage of grave space has become ' critical ' in many towns - with councils having nowhere left to bury the dead			1
@entity13 mp @entity12 urged ministers to let churches and council cemeteries re-use older graves to ease the crisis			1
traditional village graves , like this one at @entity20 's church in @entity22 west @entity21 , are rapidly filling up , mps have warned @entity25 , or cryomation - involves using liquid nitrogen to chill the body to -196c , leaving it so brittle that it can be ‘ fragmented ’ on a vibrating mat. a magnet then removes metal objects such as fillings and artificial limbs , leaving a sterile powder			1
@entity36 bodies placed in silk bags and submerged in an alkaline solution that has been heated to 160c			0
flesh , organs and bones all dissolve under the onslaught , leaving behind a combination of green - brown fluid and white powder			2
ashes turned into diamonds - this technique utilises the fact that both human beings and diamonds are carbon - based			2
a body is cremated and the resulting ash is then purified at @entity53 before being further heated and pressurised into a diamond over a 16 - week period			2
such a move would involve lifting out remains from graves that are more than 75 - years - old , burying them deeper in the same grave and then re-using the space on top			1
many cemeteries in @entity21 are already full and are allowed , under emergency 2007 laws , to re-use old graves			1
but this exemption only applies to the capital			0
it comes after warnings that almost half of @entity70 's cemeteries could run out of space within a generation			0
and in just 30 years all of @entity6 's public cemeteries are now expected to be full			1
dr @entity12 said that in one part of her @entity77 constituency there are just 16 empty burial plots left			1
sir @entity79 , the @entity13 mp who represents the @entity80 in @entity81 , said the law did not make it clear whether churches or local councils were responsible for providing burial space			1
local churches have traditionally provided the a town 's main graveyard - but many are full and have been ' closed '			0
at the same time councils are finding it increasingly difficult to find space for new cemeteries			0
it emerged last year that many @entity93 were already resorting to converting car parks into cemeteries to meet the demand			0
earlier this year the @entity80 moved to tackle the crisis by offering discounts for cremations rather than burial because of the shortage of space			0
dr @entity12 warned that some cemeteries in her constituency were almost full and called on ministers to consider allowing churches and @entity108 to reuse plots for new burials dr @entity12 's warning came during a @entity113 debate yesterday			1
she asked sir @entity79 about the ' critical shortage of burial places ? ' the @entity13 mp said : ' in @entity121 in my constituency , there are only 16 places left			1
' all the measures available have been instituted , such as using plots that have not been taken up and clearing extra ground in cemeteries , but we are now reaching a critical shortage , and i gather that the situation is repeated around the country			1
' dr @entity12 added : ' i feel that it is best to deal with this before we reach the point where there is nowhere left			2
' although this is an uncomfortable question and of course no one likes the idea of having to reuse plots			0
the reality is : what is the alternative ? ' sir @entity79 said dr @entity12 was ' absolutely right '			2
he said : ' she has identified what i suspect is something of a lacuna in the legislation about who is responsible for making provision for new cemeteries and new burial ground places			0
' in my constituency , in @entity152 , there are difficulties			0
land around the towns is valuable as development land — farmers and landowners are not keen to give up land for new burial grounds — and it can be quite a challenge for district or town councils to provide new burial space			0
' last year , cemetery experts warned that the only way to solve the crisis was to re-use old graves			2
@entity170 , the head of the @entity171 , said : ' if the public are to continue to have access to local and affordable burial space , there is no alternative to the re-use of old , abandoned graves			0
' mr @entity170 added : ' @entity179 needed to build new cemeteries could be saved , and spent on the living , through the re-use of graves			2
' the @entity183 has said the issue is ' under constant review ' .			0

@entity13 mp @entity12 warns shortage of graves now ' critical '
experts say there will be no graves left to bury dead within 30 years
@entity21 cemeteries allowed to rebury the dead - but rest of country banned
