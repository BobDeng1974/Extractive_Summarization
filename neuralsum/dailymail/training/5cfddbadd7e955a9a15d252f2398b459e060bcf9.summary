crushing pressures , powerful winds and acidic clouds have meant that any probes ever sent to @entity4 have only ever lasted a few hours			1
now @entity5 is proposing a windsurfing rover that it claims could to take on @entity4 ' severe environment by sailing across its surface			1
the rover , dubbed the @entity11 , is designed to work at extremely low powers while carrying electronics that can function at a temperature of 450 ° @entity15 the rover , dubbed the @entity11 , is being proposed by @entity16 of the @entity17			1
it is designed to work at extremely low powers and only has two moving parts it is being designed by @entity16 of the @entity17 in @entity19 as part of @entity5 ’s @entity21 ( @entity21 ) programme			1
@entity4 is often labelled as @entity24 's twin due to its similar size , gravity and ‘ terrestrial ’ composition , which is largely made up of silicate rocks or metals			2
in reality , however , @entity4 is thought to be one of the most hostile environments in the solar system			1
the planet is cloaked in a thick layer of highly reflective clouds of sulphuric acid			0
it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system , consisting mostly of carbon dioxide			2
the tri-wheeled @entity44 - rising some seven meters or 22 feet above the @entity4 terrain - will be mostly stationary.analysing the ground , and every now and then will rove across @entity4 to a new spot the crushing atmospheric pressure at the planet 's surface is 92 times that of @entity24 's			1
‘ compared to @entity56 , @entity4 has been a comparatively unexplored planet , ’ said dr @entity16 , detailing his progress during the 2013 @entity54 , held last march in @entity55			2
‘ but @entity4 is phenomenally difficult to explore , ’ he added			0
dr @entity16 claims the ideal vehicle to do so would need to be able to rove across the surface using the ambient resources of the planet			0
‘ one approach is just live with the high temperatures by using high - temperature devices , ’ said mr @entity16			0
@entity4 ’ environment is comparable to inside of a revved up jet engine , and @entity17 technologists have pioneered sensors that can work in these conditions			1
@entity4 and its corrosive atmosphere is thought to be one of the most hostile environments in the solar system			1
the planet is cloaked in a thick layer of highly reflective clouds of sulphuric acid @entity4 is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity			1
similar in structure and size to @entity24 , @entity4 ' thick , toxic atmosphere traps heat			1
the scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead			0
it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system , consisting mostly of carbon dioxide			0
the crushing atmospheric pressure at the planet 's surface is 92 times that of @entity24 's			0
according to the team , their electronics can function even at the sweltering @entity4 temperature of 450 ° @entity15 @entity4 ’ winds are a little over 2mph , but provide significant force			2
‘ a sail rover would be extraordinary for @entity4			1
the sail has only two moving parts - just to set the sail and set the steering position - and that does n't require a lot of power			0
‘ there 's no power required to actually drive , ’ said mr @entity16			0
the tri-wheeled @entity44 - rising some seven meters or 22 feet above the @entity4 terrain - wo n't be a speedster scooting across the planet , @entity16 said			2
similar in structure and size to @entity24 , @entity4 ' thick , toxic atmosphere traps heat			2
the scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead it will be a vehicle that mostly sits in one place , analysing the ground , and every now and then will rove across @entity4 to a new spot			0
‘ most of @entity4 is remarkably flat , ’ he added			0
‘ it is as flat and rocky as a parking lot			0
’ the rover is designed to drive equally well forward or backward			0
this allows the vehicle to back off of obstructions			0
mr @entity16 and his colleagues on the @entity21 - funded study envisage 12 square meters of solar cell - laden sail - tooling across @entity4 for about a month , chalking up 15 minutes of sailing per day			1
‘ the fundamental elements of a rover for @entity4 are not beyond the bounds of physics , ’ said mr @entity16			2
‘ we could survive the furnace of @entity4 if we can come up with an innovative concept for a rover that can move on extremely low power levels , ’ he said .			1

the rover , dubbed the @entity11 , is designed to work at extremely low powers
@entity5 envisages a sail seven meters in height and covered in solar cells
it has been designed to *withstand* @entity4 ' corrosive atmosphere , acidic clouds , crushing pressures and *fierce* winds
