by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 suffered a @entity4 aftershock yesterday as they plunged to 20th in the @entity6 world rankings , their lowest position for more than 18 years			1
@entity9 ’s team , having failed to win any of five games in june and taken just one point from three @entity4 fixtures , slipped 10 places			1
it is a bigger drop than any of the 32 teams in @entity16 apart from @entity17 , and they are now ranked behind @entity19 , @entity20 , the @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity9 ( right ) will be eager to improve the standing before the qualifying groups for the 2018 @entity4 in @entity41 are drawn			2
the draw will take place in @entity44 next july and if they follow previous protocol , @entity6 will use their world rankings to dictate the seeds for the nine @entity49 groups			0
solo point : the @entity2 team before they faced @entity22 in the only @entity4 match they did n't lose missed : @entity27 wastes an opportunity to put @entity2 ahead against @entity22 thanks for the support : @entity9 applauds the traveling @entity2 fans in @entity56 @entity2 are ranked 12th in @entity57 and , as it stands , would go into @entity59 , which boosts their chances of being grouped with a country such as @entity31 or @entity62 and reduces their chances of qualifying for the tournament itself			1
of the 13 @entity49 qualifiers for the @entity4 in @entity16 , eight came from @entity67 , two from @entity59 and three from @entity68			2
after their triumph in @entity71 last sunday , @entity31 are ranked no 1 for the first time in 20 years			0
@entity4 runners - up @entity73 are second with @entity75 third and @entity77 fourth			0
@entity62 slip seven places to eighth			0
@entity79 , who are @entity2 ’s first opponents in the qualifiers for @entity82 , in september , are ranked ninth .			0

@entity2 now ranked 20th in the @entity6 rankings
@entity9 's men are now behind @entity88 , @entity22 and @entity21
@entity2 *picked* up just one point in @entity16
failure to win a game makes this @entity2 's worst @entity4 since 1958
@entity2 's lowest ranking position since 1995
