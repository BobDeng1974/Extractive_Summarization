the moon is set to turn a sinister - looking blood red this @entity2 weekend			1
the total lunar eclipse will transform the moon on saturday night and will be visible in the skies of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
according to one @entity11 pastor , the event was predicted in the @entity12 and hints at an imminent world - changing event , but @entity15 is quick to point out that the change in hue is entirely harmless			1
a previous total lunar eclipse as seen from @entity23 on december 21 , 2010 is pictured the eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons , with the final one expected on september 28			2
pastor @entity28 told @entity29 that the sight suggests a world - changing event will take place , as predicted in the @entity12			1
according to the @entity12 : ‘ the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity38 comes			1
’ mr @entity28 , who has written a book on the @entity40 called ‘ @entity41 ’ , said that because the @entity43 falls on @entity44 , it ’s a sign that ' something dramatic will happen which will change the whole world '			2
the event is called a @entity40 since it involves four successive total blood red lunar eclipses each followed by six full moons			1
‘ i believe we 're going to see something dramatic happen in the @entity52 involving @entity53 that will change the course of history in the @entity52 and impact the whole world , ' he said			0
the strange celestial sight , which will be visible in the @entity11 , was predicted in the @entity12 and could hint at a world - changing event , such as the return of @entity60 , according to one pastor			1
this image shows the red moon over a church in @entity65 during the last blood moon in october last year a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity70			1
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the @entity74 is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it makes it appear red			2
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			2
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
there are numerous mentions of blood moons in the @entity12 , such as in the @entity92 , chapter two , which says the ' @entity93 will be as when the sun refuses to shine ' and in @entity95 , which hints that signs in the sun , moon and stars will tell of the second coming			1
while the @entity12 prophesises blood moons , it does not give a timeline of when the significant event will happen			1
mr @entity28 said : ‘ it just says “ when you see these signs ” - and four blood moons is a very significant one - ' ” the end of this age is coming			1
” ’ while the event may be of huge religious significance to some people , for others it will simply be a chance to see something beautiful light up the night sky			0
the lunar eclipse will occur when the moon passes behind the @entity70 , into its shadow			0
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity70			0
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the sun is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it appears red			2
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			2
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
when the moon first enters the @entity70 's partial shadow , know as the penumbra , a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon			0
this gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks			0
at the eclipse 's peak , the moon enters the @entity70 's full shadow ; the umbra			0
at this stage , the @entity70 's atmosphere scatters the sun 's red visible light ; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			2
as a result , the red light reflects off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it blood moons - an image from the last event is shown - are predicted in the @entity12			1
according to the @entity12 : ‘ the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity38 comes ’ two of the four blood moons have already occured			1
the first happened on april 15 , 2014 and the second on october 8 , 2014			0
the third blood moon will begin on saturday april 4 , 2015 the last will happen on september 28 , 2015 ‘ during the eclipse , the moon often looks reddish because sunlight has passed through @entity70 's atmosphere , which filters out most of its blue light , ’ @entity15 said			1
‘ this eerie , harmless effect has earned the tongue - in - cheek nickname “ blood moon ” ’ the ‘ @entity40 ’ of four alignments within two years , happens just a few times in every 2,000 years			1
@entity195 watchers will have to be quick to catch this installment because @entity15 predicts the total eclipse will last for just five minutes in the @entity11			0
the partial phases will be visible on april 4 just before the sun rises in the @entity11 , @entity198 reported			2
people living on the @entity202 of @entity6 will see the moon turn red from 7.58am ( 11.58 gmt ) , while sky watchers in @entity8 , @entity205 , @entity206 , and @entity7 will see the total phases for up 12 minutes , from 7.54am edt			1
an airliner crosses the moon 's path above @entity211 , @entity212 , one hour before a total lunar eclipse earlier this year which some people believe signifies the beginning of a number of significant religious event other - worldly : the incredible view from the @entity220 @entity219 of @entity221 illuminating : the moon glows orange , as seen from @entity223 in the @entity11 saturday ’s total lunar eclipse , which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange , will be visible in in the skies of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
in this image the last blood moon is situated high above @entity230 the ' @entity40 , ' cycle began in april last year			1
it involves a series of four dark red ' blood moons			2
' at the end of the cycle in september 2015 , some believe the end of the world will happen the final blood moon of the @entity40 will occur on september 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st century			1
but @entity15 has previously said that the @entity40 only happened three times in the past 500 years			0
from 1600 to 1900 , for example , there were none at all			0
according to mr @entity28 , each time the @entity40 has happened during that time , there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it			2
in 1493 , the first @entity40 saw the expulsion of @entity250 by the @entity251			0
the second happened in 1949 , right after the @entity53 was founded			0
and the most recent one , in 1967 , happened during the @entity254 between @entity255 and @entity53			0
mr @entity28 said that the first of the @entity40 blood moons happened on april 15 , right in the middle of the @entity250 holiday of @entity260			2
the second , on october 8 , occured during the feast of the @entity263			0
the third , this saturday is also occurring during @entity260 and on @entity44			0
the final one happens on september 28 , 2015 , during the @entity266			0
the final blood moon of the @entity40 will occur on september 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st @entity271 is seen glowing red and partially obscured in shadow as it rises during a total lunar eclipse from @entity275 , @entity276 in october			1

it 's the third blood moon in the ' @entity40 ' that will end in september
