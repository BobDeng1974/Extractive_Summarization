the hair is fair once again but in other respects it was the same old grumpy @entity2 that @entity4 and @entity5 fans will recognise as he suffered a nightmare return to the @entity7 with @entity8 on wednesday night			1
@entity2 , who played a cameo in @entity5 's 2012 @entity7 triumph , had waited 10 long months to take part in @entity13 's top club competition , last appearing in @entity5 's defeat against @entity8 in last april 's semi-final			1
since then , he has been shown the door by @entity17 and sent out on loan back to @entity8 by his new club @entity19			2
@entity2 - who came on as a 64th minute substitute - ( left ) battles for the ball on wednesday night @entity2 ( right ) and his @entity8 team - mates are incensed after his 75th minute headed goal was disallowed the @entity26 striker continues his protests as he asks the official behind the line why his goal was ruled out with @entity8 trailing 1 - 0 to @entity32 , the script was written for @entity2 to save the day when he was sent on as a 64th minute substitute by @entity34			1
at one time , particularly around his @entity36 peak , @entity2 would have been the hero			2
his 75th minute header from close range was ruled out because referee @entity39 adjudged the initial @entity8 corner to have gone out of play before it reached the stooping @entity43 at the far post			1
torres looked irritated by that decision , waving his arms in impotent fury			0
and further sulking was to come , in the final minute he was chopped down by @entity51			0
enraged , he got up and shoved the nearest @entity32 player to him , which happened to be @entity54 - @entity53 @entity2 became the 10th player on the night to be booked and soon after the final whistle blew , leaving last season 's beaten @entity7 finalists to contemplate going out at the last - 16 stage this time			1
the experienced striker ( left ) challenges for the ball with @entity32 midfielder @entity62 ( right ) an @entity8 fan holds a banner in support of ' @entity2 ' - who was making his 11th appearance since rejoining the former @entity5 striker applauds the travelling support after a disappointing night for him and @entity8 the second leg , in which @entity8 have to claw back a 1 - 0 deficit without another @entity73 player @entity72 who was sent off in @entity74 , might be the last chance for 30 - year - old @entity45 to show he still has super-human powers , even if they have n't been seen for a number of years			1
he signed for @entity19 in the summer , scored one goal for them in @entity82 , and though @entity8 fans were excited by his three goals in the @entity85 , he is still looking for his first strike in @entity87			2
and yet , @entity8 is the club where it all started for him			0
the fans love him and the team need him as @entity34 admitted			0
' i brought on @entity2 because we needed some fresh impetus , ' he said			0
' we have a lot of injuries and suspensions going into the second leg but we still have hope			0
' @entity45 will have to put the tetchiness of the first leg behind him and start smiling , and scoring , again quickly .			0

@entity2 made a first appearance in 10 months in the @entity7 on wednesday night
the @entity8 striker came on as a 64th minute substitute in a disappointing 1 - 0 defeat for the @entity87 side against @entity32
the 30 - year - old was *ineffective* throughout his time on the pitch
@entity2 was incensed at the decision to disallow his 75th minute goal
