contrary to popular belief , bookmakers do get it wrong			0
the fluctuations of football manager betting markets provide the proof			1
in the last week @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 have all been quoted as favourites for the @entity12 job			1
@entity7 has since ruled himself out , @entity8 is currently golfing in @entity13 and @entity9 received some informal , indirect overtures via third parties last week , but has heard nothing since			1
on tuesday @entity17 was quoted for the @entity12 job at long odds of 33/1			1
by thursday he was even money			0
@entity21 confirmed something was afoot at a press conference in @entity39 ahead of @entity19 ’s weekend friendly with @entity29			1
@entity12 say @entity17 has not been offered the job , that they are still speaking to a number of candidates			1
that @entity17 is now the first choice of major shareholder @entity22 , however , seems clear enough			1
@entity17 , says his @entity19 colleague , ‘ has a lot to consider			1
’ ‘ the question @entity52 will be asking himself now is whether the @entity12 job is a big enough challenge for him ? ’ said former @entity48 boss and @entity50 analyst @entity47			1
‘ where is the challenge ? @entity12 ca n’t do a great deal in @entity57 , can they ? @entity58 now is reaching the @entity59			1
‘ so it ’s down to whether he wants it or not			0
if he does , then it ’s a good job for him and a good appointment for @entity12			1
’ discussion : @entity17 talks to manager @entity21 as coaches @entity69 and @entity71 watch on amongst supporters that ’s not a common view			1
like @entity7 , the 42 - year - old would be a ‘ marquee ’ capture for @entity22			1
he is a big name			0
the kind of high - profile figure who , in the parlance of these things , might put ‘ bums on seats ’			0
for a time at least			0
in 2006 , the deal to take the combative midfielder to @entity12 for a final swansong after leaving @entity88 was done at @entity22 ’s behest			1
the @entity91 billionaire was also instrumental in bringing together the @entity92 and the managerial dream team he could now be on the verge of dismantling			1
a man who likes to hear an @entity91 accent or two around @entity99 would regard @entity17 as quite a catch			1
amongst supporters , however , there is less enthusiasm for @entity17			1
an icon at @entity105 , @entity17 has hardly been a roaring success in management			1
his appointment , some suspect , would be a commercial decision more than a logical footballing one			0
it ’s three years since @entity17 was last a front - line manager in @entity113 , a miserable 21 month stint in charge of @entity116 ending in the sack			1
‘ what are @entity12 fans worried about ? ’ asked an incredulous @entity47			2
‘ are they worried they are not going to win the @entity123 league ? because they do n’t have to worry about that			0
they ’ll win that by 20 points whoever comes in			0
‘ i do n’t see where the concern is			0
if this happens , then it ’s a good appointment from @entity12 ’s point of view and it ’s a good chance for @entity52 to make some progress again			2
most of all in @entity57			0
’ many of the worries over @entity17 concern his man management skills			2
pundits : @entity17 and @entity21 on air for @entity138 during coverage of a @entity59 tie last season old @entity142 : @entity17 played half a season with @entity12 after leaving @entity105 in the 2005 - 2006 campaign a loathing for the hair gel and @entity148 generation of modern football players brokered a series of bust - ups , rows and broken relationships at @entity154 and @entity116			1
he took the @entity155 up in his first season in charge			0
writing in his autobiography , however , @entity158 accused his former @entity88 team - mate of ruling the @entity161 by fear			2
one tale concerning the destruction of a tactics board is now infamous			0
‘ the board goes up , ’ recalled @entity158			0
‘ and @entity167 takes a running jump and smashes it over with a kung - fu kick			0
‘ and then the captain ( @entity170 ) is next			0
“ captain ? captain ? some f * * * * * * captain you are ” , he rages , slapping @entity170 about the head in the process before turning on us all			0
“ i ca n’t trust any of you ”			0
’ one of the players who proved a constant source of frustration was @entity181 , now at @entity12			2
the two have since reunited on international duty , but you would pay a penny or two for the striker ’s thoughts this morning			0
when @entity17 quit @entity154 , @entity158 sent him a text message wishing him future success			2
@entity17 was short and succinct in reply			2
‘ go f * * * yourself ’ was the response			0
matters barely improved at @entity116			0
fellow @entity196 man @entity195 told of @entity198 players feeling a surge of relief when @entity17 was sacked in january 2011			2
questions over his interpersonal and diplomatic skills have been a pattern of his management career			0
and despite a brief six - month spell at @entity48 as a player and close links with @entity22 and @entity21 , there is nothing on his recent cv which screams ‘ @entity12 manager ’			1
whilst a @entity48 player , @entity17 kept his family in @entity113 and seemed almost semi-detached from his surroundings			1
quizzed on a return last week he was effusive , but non-committal			0
‘ they are a brilliant club , an absolutely fantastic football club , one of the best in the world			0
but i have got a job , ’ he said			0
in truth , he has two			0
in the frame : @entity9 has also been considered as @entity12 seek a replacement for @entity224 shortlist : @entity8 , last in employment at @entity227 , was also considered by @entity12 a cutting , incisive analyst on @entity138 , @entity17 surprised everybody last november when he agreed to become @entity21 ’s assistant			1
the @entity92 later thanked @entity22 for the role he played in making their managerial dream team a reality			1
they may soon have cause to curse him for taking @entity17 away			1
that @entity22 ’s close business acquaintance and @entity12 shareholder @entity237 is effectively funding his wages limits their ability to resist , however			1
should he accept , @entity17 would be expected to work with the current @entity12 transfer model of buying young and selling big			1
he would have a direct line to @entity22 , but would be expected to work with the chief executive @entity243 and scouting chief @entity244 , currently considering his own offer from @entity246			2
the dynamics of those relationships would be a source of intrigue			0
in @entity39 there is speculation @entity17 could be asked to stay on as @entity19 ’s number two , dovetailing the role with managing @entity12			1
whether that ’s possible when @entity19 are in the same @entity257 qualifying group as @entity258 is debatable			2
the decision will be helped by the advice of an old sage			0
‘ i ’d be disappointed if he was to go , ’ said @entity21			2
‘ but a club like @entity12 is a very big club and those offers do n’t come around too often			2
’ @entity21 once spent weeks agonising over a move to @entity48 following a @entity22 overture			1
he admitted as much yesterday and said : ‘ ah listen , for me that ’s what i wanted to do in 2000 when @entity12 came for me			2
i loved @entity273 , it was great			0
@entity12 came along and it was what i wanted to do			2
’ no one , you suspect , recognises the dilemma facing @entity17 this morning more than he does .			0

@entity19 boss @entity278 says @entity17 has had informal chat with @entity12 **'s** majority shareholder @entity22
