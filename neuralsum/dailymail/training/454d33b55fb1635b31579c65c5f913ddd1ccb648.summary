the @entity0 may conjure up images of impressive ice sheets and freezing winds , but scenes from a webcam there reveal a different story			1
two weeks of warm weather in the high @entity9 have caused an aquamarine lake to begin forming since july 13 , according to the @entity12 ’s camera			1
the @entity13 and @entity14 has reported that temperatures in early july were one to three degrees @entity16 higher than the year ’s average over most of the @entity9			1
the ice is expected to be further fractured by an @entity9 cyclone , which is currently developing over the area			2
according to @entity27 , the weather system will strengthen winds to anywhere from 75 - 100 km / h. last august , a similar system developed in the area which destroyed 800,000 square km of ice			0
however , the @entity9 hit record low ice melt last year on september 16 , 2012 , the smallest recorded since satellites began tracking the @entity9 ice in the 1970s			1
the @entity36 reported that temperatures in early july were one to three degrees @entity16 higher than the year 's average over most of the @entity9 but experts are divided over what the recent data will mean for the future sea - levels			1
‘ i have seen much more extensive ponding , ’ @entity43 , the principal investigator for the @entity12 told the @entity44			2
‘ because we use wide angle lenses the melt pond looks much bigger than it is			0
’ @entity43 also pointed out that a camera 100 meters away showed the ice looking relatively intact			0
he added that the scale of these images is also quite small			0
last week a team of researchers led by dr @entity55 at the @entity56 claimed that long - term data on the melting of @entity60 ’s polar is too weak to suggest alarming decrease is permanent or caused by humans			1
the images above show sea ice coverage in 1980 and 2012 , as observed by passive microwave sensors on @entity68 's @entity67 - 7 satellite and by the @entity70 / @entity69			2
multi-year ice is shown in bright white , while average sea ice cover is shown in light blue to milky white the group compared nine years of satellite measurements of glaciers in @entity78 and @entity79 in an attempt to determine if the melt - off is part of an accelerating trend in ice loss and sea - level rise			2
while the study showed a loss of about 300 billion tonnes of ice per year from the @entity9 and @entity79 regions , it noted that natural processes can not be ruled out as the force behind the receding ice sheets			1
last week a team of researchers led by dr @entity55 at the @entity56 claimed that long - term data on the melting of @entity60 's polar is too weak to suggest alarming decrease is permanent or caused by humans we could refreeze the @entity9 , and it would n't even cost that much , a scientist claims			1
two published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the @entity0			0
the scientist who is lead author on both claims that ' any significant nation ' could find the resources to carry out the operation			0
the only significant question , he says , is whether we should			0
@entity112 , professor of applied physics at @entity114 , is lead author on papers published in @entity116 and @entity117 which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice			0
he used climate models to suggest injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity60 , engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the @entity9			1
his paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea - ice around the @entity0 back to pre-industrial era levels			0
his second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified @entity135 jets , costing somewhere in the region of $ 8billion a year			2
however , while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the @entity60 's atmosphere , he does n't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest .			0

@entity12 images show lake forming in @entity9
temperatures over most of the region were one to three degrees @entity16 higher than the year ’s average
some experts claim data is too weak to suggest decrease in ice is permanent
