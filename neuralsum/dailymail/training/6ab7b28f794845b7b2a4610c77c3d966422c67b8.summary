with dna and computer records , policing has come a long way in the last century			2
but one thing remains eerily similar - the humble mugshot			0
these 1880s photographs were among the first of their kind , showing a host of sepia - printed criminals staring into the camera and holding up their hands to show tattoos or missing digits			1
inspired by the work of @entity18 criminologist @entity17 , who was the first to take ' standardised ' photographs so convicts could be told apart , the images feature in a new exhibition which documents our fascination with forensic science			2
the technique of standardising photos - with similar clothes and background to spot distinguishing features - was pioneered by the @entity18 criminologist @entity17 @entity34 : an photofit book from 1970 provided by the @entity36			1
in 1938 @entity37 , a facial topographer , began to develop a system of illustrations to identify facial features , which later became a bank of photographic images used to help witnesses record the details of suspects			1
this system replaced the ‘ identikit ’ that used line drawings on overlaid acetate sheets , and gradually expanded as more police forces introduced the system			0
for instance , the selection of white male features comprised 204 different foreheads and hairstyles cracked : the fractured skull of a murder victim who suffered repeated blows with a blunt instrument sometime in the 1960s and reconstructed behind every crime is a trail of evidence , of shattered bones , bloodied tiles , empty shell casings , of sketches and mugshots			1
physical remnants of foul deeds , waiting to be found and pieced together to convict the guilty			2
this is the stuff of forensic science , and now the exhibition in central @entity76 has honed in on the fascination by showcasing a collection of original evidence , footage and instruments from real cases throughout history			1
' forensics : the @entity85 ' , which opens at the @entity86 this week , includes the shattered skull of a murder victim , a brain damaged by bullet holes and a floor where a murdered man was found			1
visitors are also able to walk into a working mortuary fridge , read original autopsy index cards and view a bullet used in a suicidal shooting - as well as the fatal wound it caused			1
in one installation , visitors will be confronted with the sounds from an autopsy of a murder victim and view the tools used by pathologists			1
the spring exhibition also features sketches from the site of a murder attributed to @entity110 as well as authentic weapons used in a murder			1
skeleton : these bones are from an installation by @entity116 named @entity117 , which means sexual murder involving rape in @entity120			2
it consists of 312 bones and 33 engraved with silver rings engraved with lines from a text and present three perspectives on sexual violence : those of the perpetrator , the victim and observer			2
they were made during the conflict in @entity134 and signify the acute physical and psychological damage caused by major war crimes and human rights abuses in 1994 crime scene : these 105 ceramic tiles and concrete floor was the site of the murder of @entity143 , the artist friend of @entity144 - who spent several years working the morgue in @entity146 and is concerned with the consequences of widespread violence in @entity146			1
he was murdered @entity150 , @entity146 in 2004 , but the motive is not known these two sections of human brain ( left ) are from a young man who committed suicide by shooting himself through the temple			2
he lived for two days but died from his injuries in the 1960s			0
the specimens show that the bullet created a blood track through both brain hemispheres , causing associated haemorrhage			1
the skull ( right ) is one of the many authentic human remains on display at the forensic exhibition in @entity76 this exhibit shows the bullet from a suicide shot and the flesh wound ( inside box , left ) in the 1960s			1
when a bullet passes through the body , heat from the gun ’s discharge causes cauterisation , creating blackened area around the wound			0
the two segments of scalp show the entry and exit wounds , along with the offending bullet , which passed through the man ’s head and subsequently became lodged in a nearby wall			0
the large - calibre bullet ( 0.455 ) was fired from a @entity193 service revolver @entity194 artist @entity144 has displayed a section of the tiled floor on which her close friend was found murdered			1
the crime scene ' signifies the absence of the person and emphasises loss ' , according to the @entity86			2
the gallery is divided into five sections including ' @entity204 ' , which investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory			0
this department also includes the work of mr @entity17 , whose ' @entity216 ' format , taken from above , brought rigour to the field			0
he also standardised the method of taking the criminal 's photograph face on and in profile , which would be added to their file card			0
@entity225 , head of public programmes at the @entity86 , which recently underwent a £ 17.5million said : ' forensics reminds us of the human body 's extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance			1
visitors are also able to walk into a mortuary fridge , part of an artwork by @entity239 exploring the missing victims of the @entity242 war of 1992 - 5			0
they can also hear the sounds from a real life autopsy and view tools used by pathologists ' forensics : the @entity85 ' opens at the @entity86 this week and includes this working morgue refrigerator			1
from a space for viewing corpses in @entity252 ( the word morgue comes from morguer , ‘ to peer ’ ) to the virtual autopsies afforded by @entity256 , @entity257 and 3d scanning , the morgue offers a vital space for questioning the dead these forensic instruments would have once been used in post-mortems but are now on display for the public in a free exhibition on friday the display allows members of the public to see first hand the evidence from what happens after a victim dies , to how the perpetrator is caught ' this unsettling truth is both the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination			2
' @entity279 , curator , said : ' this exhibition gives alternative views of the forensic process from the @entity283 of popular fiction and television , whilst exploring the cultural fascination that the disciplines of forensic medicine inspire			0
' our journey from crime scene to courtroom takes in pioneers of scientific techniques that have revolutionised the way in which crimes are investigated , and offers visitors unexpected encounters with the changing relationship between medicine , law and society			0
' the free exhibition opens thursday and runs to june 21			0
these autopsy notes are from celebrity pathologist sir @entity305 , and have been displayed for the first time at the new exhibition this book , ' @entity309 : @entity310 ' , was written by @entity311 in 1898			0
it explains that in an external examination the surface of the body is inspected and any irregular signs , scars , lesions or abnormalities as a result of disease or trauma are noted			0
in addition , the appearance of livor mortis – discolouration caused by the settling of blood under the skin – is assessed			0
also known as lividity orhypostasis , this transformation is usually apparent half an hour to two hours after death , fully developing within 12 hours the gallery is divided into five sections including ' @entity204 ' , which investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory from the @entity344 to the @entity345 the exhibition closes with the space which brings together themany strands of forensic medicine , either as a conclusion to an investigation , or tocontest previous convictions the free public gallery opens on thursday at the @entity86 in central @entity76 and will be on display until june 21			1
pictured , the art installation entitled @entity355 by @entity116			0

a new exhibition called ' forensics : the anatomy of @entity360 ' will open at @entity86 in @entity76 this week
it includes a brain damaged by bullet holes , the floor where a murder victim was found and a mortuary refrigerator
a 19th century photo album full of mugshots features suspects showing their hands for distinguishing features
