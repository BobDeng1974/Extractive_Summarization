by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:13 est , 5 december 2013 a bitter - and somewhat superstitious - ex has posted a @entity5 ad in @entity6 for a pretty diamond engagement ring with one small flaw : it used to belong to ' @entity10 herself			1
' along with a 1.5 carat diamond ring in a white gold setting , buyers should be aware when purchasing , writes the poster , that they also risk biblical plagues and a broken heart			1
the poster concludes that if he is not successful in selling the ring by @entity19 , he plans to throw the ring ' into the fires of @entity22			1
' not forever : the owner of this ring is hoping to be rid of it forever by @entity19 to prevent it visiting any more disasters on him the ring is for sale with a price tag of $ 1,800 , which the poster writes is significantly less than he paid for it from @entity34 's			1
purchase of the ring must be made at your own risk though , warns the the seller , documenting a trail of destruction left in its wake			2
' possible events associated with this ring include but are not limited to : damage sustained to house , vehicle , heart , downed powerlines , fallen trees , and swarms of locus [ sic ] , ' reads the ad			2
it is unclear whether the ring or ' @entity10 herself ' was responsible for these catastrophes , but the poster recommends covering your bases			2
' i would highly recommend taking action to counter the whirlwind of bad mojo that surround this piece of jewelry , ' he writes , suggesting a voodoo priest may be able to exorcise the ' curse			0
' bad luck : the seller claims the pretty ring is responsible for destruction and heartbreak - a unique selling point it seems the ring is the product of a broken engagement , as the woman to whom it belonged only wore it for ' a short period of time			1
' the white gold and diamond ring with diamonds along the sides and a lower setting ' so the diamonds wo n't snag on everything ' comes in its original box			1
the ad was placed last week and is still active - so if @entity10 herself having been a previous owner is not a problem , buyers should nab it before @entity19 when it will meet a fiery fate			1
for sale i have a 1.5ct total weight engagement ring set in @entity101 white gold			1
the ring is in like new condition , only worn for a short period of time by @entity10 herself			2
comes with the original box			0
very pretty ring with a lower setting so the diamonds wo n't snag on everything			0
diamonds along the sides and in the channel setting show off light from all sides			0
originally purchased from @entity34 's for a sum of money far greater than i am comfortable @entity119 : ring may be cursed as it tends to leave a path of destruction behind it			0
possible events associated with this ring include but are not limited to : damage sustained to house , vehicle , heart , downed powerlines , fallen trees , and swarms of locus			0
i would highly recommend taking action to counter the whirlwind of bad mojo that surround this piece of jewelry			0
should consider having curse removed by voodoo priest or something before presenting to loved one			0
other than that a very nice piece of @entity144 to sell this soon before it brings any more bad luck into my life and i 'd rather have cash			0
if not sold by @entity19 i plan to throw it into the fires of @entity22 .			2

a @entity5 ad for an engagement ring comes complete with a *history* of catastrophes *ostensibly* caused by the ring
it was worn for a brief period by ' @entity10 herself '
during that time the @entity5 poster was visited with *terrible* *misfortune*
if it is not sold by @entity19 the poster plans to pitch it into ' the fires of @entity22 ' rather than risk more destruction
the *innocuous* - looking white gold and diamond ring is priced at $ 1,800
