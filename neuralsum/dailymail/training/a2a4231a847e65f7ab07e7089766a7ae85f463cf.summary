school pupils should have an hour a week of ' happiness classes ' to prevent them costing taxpayers millions in mental health care , benefits and even jail time , a former health minister has warned			1
influential surgeon @entity7 , who served under @entity8 from 2007 to 2009 , made the call in a report which blasts ' exam factory ' schools and warns of a youth mental health crisis			1

stress : pupils should be given an hour a week of ' happiness classes ' to stop them needing mental health treatment , says a former health minister			1
thousands are calling @entity32 over exam stress ( posed by model ) many of the topics are already covered by @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and economic education ( @entity41 ) , but the subject 's contents are not fully laid down by law			1
@entity7 's report called for a structured approach to emotional education and said teachers should be discouraged from ' improvising ' based on their own experiences			1
the report , co-written with economist and former government adviser @entity52 , is due to be presented on tuesday to the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55			2
it has called on the government , councils , schools , volunteer groups and the @entity61 to work together and said children 's mental health can affect society years down the line			0
influential : the report 's author @entity7 was a @entity8 health minister between 2007 and 2009 one of the focuses must be emotional well - being , it insisted - echoing ' happiness classes ' which were introduced at @entity72 's £ 34,000 - a - year @entity71 in 2006 and are said to have been a runaway success			1
' increasingly in many countries , schools are becoming exam factories , ' the report said			2
' to improve child wellbeing , this must be reversed			0
' our children are our future			0
so , we ignore their mental health at our peril			0
at least a half of all mental health problems emerge by the age of 18			0
' yet , even in rich countries , only a quarter of young people in need of help get any specialist treatment , and many fewer in poorer countries			0
' good psychological treatments exist but they are simply not properly available			0
this is grossly inhumane and also inefficient			0
' mental health problems place massive costs on the rest of society – educational failure , adolescent crime , teenage pregnancy , and ultimately benefit dependence			0
' one - off programmes offering 20 hours of ' life skills ' classes were not enough to make a difference , the report said			1
' if children are to develop good life skills , they need more than one or two 20 - hour programs , ' the report added			1
' they need a whole curriculum of life skills , at least once a week throughout the school life			2
' this curriculum should be evidence - based and depend as little as possible on inspired improvisation by the teacher			0
' last week @entity32 warned the number of calls it receives about exam stress tripled in just one year			1
the charity said more than half of all its school - related counselling sessions - 7,546 last year - were about exams and work pressure rather than bullying or relationships			1

' another said : ' the amount of work i have from school is piling up and i am finding it hard to keep up			0
' i am in my gcse year and it ’s important to be on track but all the extra work and deadlines is making me so stressed i end up taking it out on my family by shouting at them			0
' a @entity32 spokesman said : ' not wanting to disappoint their parents , fear of failure and the general pressures linked to academic achievement were all major themes			2
' stresses about exams affected young people ’s ability to sleep , triggered anxiety attacks , depression and tearfulness , and eating disorders			2
in some cases it also led to self - harm and suicidal feelings , or made them worse			0
