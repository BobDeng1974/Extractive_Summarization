by @entity0 published : 00:51 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 19:04 est , 19 april 2013 police have arrested @entity4 's former military ruler @entity3 at his home where he had holed up following a dramatic escape from court to avoid detention , it emerged today			1
@entity3 fled @entity9 in a speeding vehicle yesterday after a judge rejected his bail and ordered his arrest in connection with a case involving his decision to fire senior judges while in power			1
it was a new low in @entity3 's troubled return from self - imposed exile last month to make a political comeback in the upcoming parliamentary election			1
police say they arrested @entity3 overnight and presented him before a judge at @entity26 this morning			1
the district court judge instructed police to keep @entity3 in their custody for two days and then present him before an anti-terrorism court , said one of his lawyers , @entity47			1
officials have declared @entity3 's home on the outskirts of @entity26 a jail , which is allowed under the country 's law , and he will be held there under house arrest			1
@entity3 's legal team has said they will challenge the arrest order in the @entity58 later			1
after @entity3 got away , @entity4 paramilitary soldiers were seen leaving the @entity9 today yesterday @entity3 was on the run after fleeing a court in the country 's capital to avoid arrest after his bail was revoked , police said			1
officers were deployed at the court building in @entity26 but @entity3 's security team rushed him out and put him in a black pick - up truck before they could detain him			1
the court rejected his bail in a case related to his decision to suspend the constitution and declare a state of emergency in 2007 , police spokesman @entity71 said			1
a spokeswoman for @entity3 , @entity79 , said his legal team is trying to decide the next move			2
formerly one of @entity4 's most powerful politicians after seizing power in a 1999 coup , @entity3 went from @entity4 president to self - imposed exile			2
during his tenure in charge of the country , which ended in 2008 , he survived numerous attempts on his life			0
the turning point of his time in charge came after the 9/11 terror attack in 2001			0
he supported @entity98 's ' @entity97 ' , which proved hugely unpopular in @entity4			0
in a bid to crush militants who supported @entity101 , he ordered his security forces to lay siege to the @entity104 and its @entity106 school in @entity26 , which was said to be campaigning to enforce @entity108 law			2
more than 100 people were killed			0
in the aftermath , @entity111 militants began a campaign of suicide bombings and @entity3 fled the country in 2008 , returning last month to participate in elections			2
his time in power was also marked by struggles with the judiciary , including an attempt to remove the chief justice in 2007 - for which he faces treason charges - and clashes over his bid to remain head of the army while still president			0
he attempted to appease the @entity129 by aiding the ' @entity97 ' but managed to further anger militants within @entity4 ... while the @entity129 criticised his dedication to fighting @entity101			0
@entity3 was also accused of not doing enough to protect former pm @entity132 from being assassinated in 2007 , despite allegedly being aware of @entity133 plans to kill her			2
it followed accusations that he was indirectly responsible for the death of @entity138 , a @entity139 leader killed in an army operation the year before			0
local television broadcast footage of @entity3 jumping into a black suv and escaping as a member of his security team clung to the outside of the vehicle			1
meanwhile lawyers shouted ' look who is running , @entity3 is running ! ' he sped away to his large compound on the outskirts of @entity26 that is protected by high walls , razor wire and guard towers			1
this week has gone from bad to worse for @entity3 , who seized power in a coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and spent nearly a decade in power before being forced to step down in 2008			2
he returned last month after four years in self - imposed exile in @entity159 to make a political comeback despite legal challenges and @entity133 death threats , but has since faced paltry public support			0
a court in the northwestern city of @entity166 on tuesday disqualified @entity3 from running in the parliamentary election scheduled for may 11 , likely squashing his hopes for political comeback			1
the case before the @entity9 today involved @entity3 's decision in 2007 to detain senior judges , including the chief justice of the @entity58 , when he declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution			2
the decision outraged many @entity4 , and further fueled a nationwide protest movement by lawyers that eventually resulted in @entity3 stepping down under the threat of impeachment			2
before he returned to the country , @entity3 obtained pre-arrest bail for the judges ' case and two others , meaning he could not be arrested when he landed - a feature of @entity4 's legal system			1
the @entity9 refused to extend that bail today and ordered his arrest , said police officer @entity71			2
the court previously agreed to extend his bail in the case for six days on april 12			0
it 's unclear why they chose to reject it this time			0
despite crowds of people , including police officers with the power to arrest him , @entity3 managed to escape to his compound @entity3 's lawyer , @entity202 , complained that the court did n't listen to their arguments , saying : ' it is a one - sided decision ' that he would challenge			1
- @entity206 , @entity207 @entity4 @entity3 's decision to flee the court could put the @entity4 army in an awkward situation			1
the former general is protected by paramilitary soldiers who officially report to the @entity214 , but are headed by senior army officers			0
@entity206 , the director of @entity207 in @entity4 , called on the military authorities protecting @entity3 to comply with the court 's order and ensure that he presents himself for arrest			1
' @entity3 's act today underscores his disregard for due legal process and indicates his assumption that as a former army chief and military dictator he can evade accountability for abuses , ' said @entity206 in a statement sent to reporters			0
@entity3 fled to his heavily - guarded compound on the edge of the city after evading arrest today ' continued military protection for @entity3 will make a mockery of claims that @entity4 's armed forces support the rule of law and bring the military further disrepute that it can ill afford , ' @entity206 said			1
@entity4 has a long history of the army seizing power in military coups , and the service is considered the most powerful institution in the country			0
if convicted of treason , @entity3 could face the death penalty or life in prison			0
but the federal government would have to file charges against the former military ruler , which it has not yet done			0
the petitions in @entity9 accusing @entity3 of treason were all filed by individuals			0
@entity3 faces similar accusations from petitions filed before the @entity58			0
he also faces legal charges in two other cases .			0

@entity3 , *69* , fled court in @entity26 yesterday after @entity265 case
security team rushed him past police waiting to arrest him and into @entity2*69*
went into *hiding* in his heavily - guarded compound on outskirts of the city
police say they have arrested him and taken back before court this morning
