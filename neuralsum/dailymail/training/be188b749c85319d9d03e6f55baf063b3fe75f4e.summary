obese people will be paid to lose weight through schemes in the workplace , under radical plans unveiled today			1
under the @entity7 - backed scheme , slimmers would be given rewards such as cash or shopping vouchers			1
employers will also be urged to offer incentives to staff who shed pounds			0
firms will be given some funding to set up slimming or exercise classes and also receive tax breaks from the government			0
critics argue that obese people should take responsibility for their own health			1
but dr @entity23 , an @entity7 consultant specialising in weight loss , says our busy lifestyles and constant temptation to eat fatty foods means this is simply unrealistic			1
dr @entity30 - who works at @entity31 and @entity32 - argues we should give overweight people as much help as possible , to try and halt the obesity crisis			1
here , she gives her view ... dr @entity23 says our busy lifestyles and constant temptation to eat fatty foods means many people simply ca n't manage their weight i am getting more and more cross			1
every time i discuss weight loss and health issues , someone will say , in a rather accusatory tone , ' surely it is down to the individual to take responsibility for their own weight and well - being '			1
perhaps , in an ideal world - but this is the real world and we need to face facts			0
how can we be stuck in a sedentary job , eating poor quality food , hunched over a computer , under stress from 9 - 5 , five days a week , and expect to have the time or energy to work on our weight , health and fitness in the remaining hours ? as an @entity7 weight loss surgeon , the person in front of me is seeking help			1
should my response then be : ' well , of course you do understand i ca n't help you - it was your personal choice , your weak will , your lack of ability to resist temptation			2
' and now you are going to die early from a weight related disease			2
' oh , and by the way , there 's a @entity78 for you as you leave the premises - in one of the many coffee shops springing up in hospitals - to help with the shock ? ' of course not – because i do n't believe that is true			0
instead , i will provide weight loss surgery , where appropriate			1
but i think we should be insisting that employers , manufactures , retail outlets , governments and especially our hospitals are doing all they can to help us keep weight off in a healthy way			2
two thirds of us are overweight or obese and we are making sure that our kids are following in our footsteps			2
the bottom line is , that however much we want to eat more healthily and take more exercise , we are surrounded by temptation wherever we turn			1
portions are getting bigger and bigger			0
manufacturers are busy dreaming up increasingly calorie - packed offerings that they market to us with well - researched psychological manipulation			2
we seem busier than ever , but in a sedentary way			0
we are often trapped in offices with limited opportunity for activity , and everything is geared towards convenience : drive - throughs , escalators , home deliveries , gadgets to reduce physical effort			0
so , yes , personal responsibility is important - but we need help			0
it is blindingly obvious that we ca n't beat this on our own			0
she argues many us are ' trapped in offices with limited opportunity for activity , and everything is geared towards convenience ' - including fast food and moving as little as possible we need manufacturers to do their bit by providing us with easy access to healthier food choices			2
we do n't need tricks such as coercing us into buying double sized chocolate bars that we all know wo n't be shared - but instead will change our perception of a normal serving			0
we also need to make health and well - being part of our daily lives , and that , for many of us , involves the workplace			1
@entity140 has today suggested that companies should be encouraged to help us tackle our weight and health			1
sugar - laden drinks are contributing to obesity dr @entity30 recently spoke out about the rise of coffee outlets in hospitals and says she no longer shakes the hands of her patients - more often than not because they arrive clutching a @entity153 take - out			2
in the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets , she has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks			0
' we read every week , in the bmj and other leading medical journals , of research detailing the perils of sugar and fizzy drinks , ' she said			0
' we frequently hear laments about the cost to the @entity7 of the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes , which is threatening to engulf us			1
' and yet , the @entity7 , which i understood to be an organisation that promotes and supports health ( rather than just treating disease ) , is actually contributing to the problem			1
' as a weight loss surgeon , i find it frustrating and , frankly , embarrassing to spend time in clinic , explaining to my patients how sugary drinks and snacks are one of the biggest drivers of obesity , when i know that just outside in our hospital foyer are not one , but two costa coffee shops , as well as vending machines stocked full of coke and chocolate			1
' this has provoked all sorts of derisory comments about how we would be affronted to have our employers forcing us on to the scales every monday for an office weigh - in			0
of course , there are good and bad ways to do this , but the crux is that many of us spend a vast proportion of our lives at work			0
so if our work environment does n't encourage us to be healthy then we just do n't stand a chance			0
@entity140 says the @entity7 is in financial crisis - but can we expect individuals to take responsibility for their health ? well it has n't worked so far			1
if we do n't challenge the causes of illness then the @entity7 is at risk of becoming bankrupt			2
when providing a cure is financially not viable any more then the only choice is to identify the cause of the imbalance and tackle it at the roots			0
it was never enough to look for a cure for cancer – it was always the aim to stop smoking through education ; through warning on packaging ; through removing temptation			0
how is it any different for obesity ? @entity140 is asking government to get involved – to offer corporate rewards for health in the workplace - and i agree			2
let 's make the most of this opportunity to improve our health , weight and well - being at our employer 's expense – and we may even find work more enjoyable as a result			1
any employer shuddering at the thought of introducing this initiative can take note of the boom in workplace wellness programmes in the @entity249 , where companies have seen the benefit of caring for their staff			0
@entity254 employers lose over £ 20 billion a year due to absenteeism , but the costs of presenteeism - reduced productivity at work due to ill - health or poor fitness - may be three times higher			1
being overweight or obese increases the number of sickness days taken by 50 per cent			0
this equates to around £ 14 billion a year in lost revenue and may increase presenteeism rates 15-fold			0
as doctors , we need to give you the holistic care you expect to help you lead a longer , happier life but , at the same time , we must try to preserve the @entity7 from bankruptcy .			1
