dozens of cheap and popular @entity2 wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic , claims a new lawsuit filed this week			1
@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 's @entity9 , also known as ' @entity11 , ' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe			1
twenty - eight @entity2 wineries were listed in the complaint , which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question			2
@entity26 said 83 wines , almost all of which sell for below $ 10 a bottle , contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water			1
the @entity41 standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard			1
' this is a very serious public health concern , ' @entity26 said			0
' we would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately			0
' ' if not voluntarily , we would ask the court to do it			0
' the @entity53 does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine , according to the @entity58			1
the lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water but wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in @entity68 - and other countries allow even higher levels			1
the @entity71 , an advocacy group for @entity2 wineries , called the lawsuit ' misleading ' and ' false '			2
according to @entity71 spokeswoman @entity75 , @entity2 wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries , she told the @entity78			1
in a release statement , the @entity71 said arsenic was ' prevalent in the natural environment ' and that ' no research ' had found the amounts in wine to ' pose a health risk to consumers '			0
the lawsuit specifies the wines contained ' inorganic arsenic , ' which is more toxic than the arsenic found naturally in the environment			2
chronic long - term consumption of inorganic arsenic can cause cancer , as well as liver and kidney damage			0
but a number of wine producers have fought back at the lawsuit and said they plan to contest the claims			0
a trader @entity10 's spokesman said the grocery store chain had ' no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe , including @entity9 @entity106 '			1
@entity7 said the lawsuit was ' without merit , ' adding that the company plans to challenge the allegations			0
the 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 @entity2 wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels			1
some of the labels included several different types of wine			0
