by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ as @entity3 produced yet another performance of midfield mastery , this time in a @entity7 semi-final , thoughts turned to the @entity9 boardroom and @entity11 ’s peculiar pursuit of the @entity12			1
under @entity13 , @entity3 had emerged as @entity11 ’s principal summer target , viewed by the @entity15 as someone that could fill the vacuum vacated by @entity19 and restore order and authority to the central acres			1
@entity13 recognised that @entity11 ’s midfield has been missing in action too often in recent times			2
in the hunger games , @entity11 were often found wanting , overpowered and overwhelmed in the central positions			0
following one @entity9 defeat last season , one source close to the @entity11 squad joked that @entity13 was having to play the ‘ polo mint formation – with nothing in the middle			2
’ @entity13 identified @entity3 as the starting pistol for a @entity11 revolution this summer - one , of course , that he was fated to never oversee - and he worked long and hard in his attempts to cut a deal for the @entity12 star , whose contract with @entity67 will expire in 12 months ’ time			1
against @entity38 on tuesday evening , @entity3 demonstrated the qualities that so appealed to @entity13			2
@entity3 is the player that represents , more than any other , the technical precision and control that defines this @entity12 side			2
his long passes are on a sixpence , his short game equally accurate and inventive			0
@entity3 is wonderfully minimalist in his movement , always available , always showing for the ball , as he drops deep , receives , lays it off , and moves the ball on with purpose			0
he barely wastes a pass , his immense intellect for football dictating the tempo of this game on his terms , like so many others for @entity67			0
he completed 93 per cent of his attempted passes and a 91.5 per cent success rate in the opposition ’s half			0
statistics can sometimes skew perceptions but these figures underline his immense talent			0
scouting mission : @entity13 ( left ) is pictured watching @entity67 play @entity97 in january @entity13 flew to @entity12 to watch @entity3 in action on several occasions , intensifying his interest around january and instructing his scouts to provide the extensive reports that he requires before committing to any major signing			1
in march , @entity13 ran the rule over @entity3 ’ performances in @entity67 ’s 5 - 1 victory over @entity107 and he then was at the @entity108 to witness the @entity12 ’s outstanding performance as @entity67 beat @entity110 , with @entity3 curling a beautiful effort to open the scoring			1
on that spring evening , he completed 147 passes , just 11 less than the entire @entity110 team managed over the 90 minutes			0
@entity13 ordered executive vice-chairman @entity116 to accelerate @entity11 ’s pursuit			2
the @entity11 manager himself was reported to have held talks and entertained @entity121 ’ representatives as the club launched a charm offensive			0
a salary approaching £ 240,000 - a - week was mooted			0
despite the absence of @entity129 football next season , the noises @entity11 received were encouraging and there was a growing confidence the player would swap the @entity133 for the @entity135 next season			0
masterclass : @entity3 is mobbed after scoring a long - range effort against @entity110 back in february when @entity11 faced @entity67 in the @entity129 quarter - final , @entity116 spoke privately to supporters in @entity12 and is understood to have assured them that big plans were in place for this summer and that the club were hopeful over deals for @entity3 and @entity144 of @entity145			1
as the manager changed , so too did the targets			0
@entity149 ’s aversion to signing @entity3 was greeted with surprise in the corridors of power at @entity9 , particularly as the @entity152 was in charge at @entity67 when the player emerged as a youngster of supreme talent in @entity12			1
his stance , however , was firm and @entity11 abandoned their extensive attempts to secure @entity3 ’ signature , instead focusing on @entity161 ’s @entity160 , who was signed in a £ 28.4million deal in june			1
@entity11 answered to @entity164 ’s demands , with @entity116 overseeing a new structure in the scouting department as @entity13 ’ men , @entity168 and @entity169 , who had joined from @entity170 , swiftly being released			2
preferred choice : @entity160 is unveiled by sir @entity172 last month @entity173 completes @entity11 transfer the priorities changed but the decision to pass up on @entity3 remains a chin - stroker			1
@entity19 admitted as much last week , stating : ‘ it is good to see @entity11 bringing in new players , but they have n't signed anything like the quality of @entity3			2
’ the @entity160 transfer fee exceeds the suggested cost for @entity3 , who is now likely to move to @entity184 for less than £ 25m , although @entity11 would rightly retort that the @entity186 ’s wage package is almost four times less than what @entity3 would have commanded			1
one theory , as bizarre as it may sound , is that @entity164 considers the @entity12 a little slow for the @entity190 game and that he lacks the athleticism to compete physically			0
another suggestion is that @entity11 became aware of @entity184 ’s interest and withdrew before they were seen off by the greater financial and romantic pull of the @entity197 side			0
as @entity3 continues to shine , the conjecture will continue but the feeling lingers that @entity11 have missed out on an extraordinary talent , and their loss will likely be @entity184 ’s gain			1
final say : incoming @entity11 manager @entity164 instructed the club not to sign @entity3 @entity205 hopeful on @entity207 fitness			1

@entity13 was confident of signing @entity3 this summer before he was sacked by @entity11 in april
@entity149 instructed club to sign @entity160 for £ 28.4m instead
@entity12 star @entity3 set to join @entity184 for less than £ 25m
