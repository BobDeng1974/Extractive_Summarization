@entity1 goal hero @entity0 enjoyed his first taste of international football and now he is hungry for more			1
@entity0 took just 79 seconds to make his mark on international football by scoring the final goal in @entity1 's 4 - 0 win over @entity8 at @entity9 on friday			1
the 21 - year - old peeled away from his marker and nodded @entity13 's cross in at the far post with just his third touch since coming off the bench			0
@entity0 wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal the @entity19 striker headed in at the far post from a @entity13 cross shortly after coming at @entity9 @entity0 celebrates as @entity1 cruise to a 4 - 0 victory over lowly @entity23 on friday night @entity1 debutant 's fastest goals : @entity26 19secs @entity27 30 @entity0 79 after enjoying such a remarkable season with @entity19 , it did not come as a surprise that @entity0 made such a dramatic entrance to the international arena			1
the forward has now scored 30 goals so far this term and he was delighted to turn his boyhood dream into reality at @entity9			0
' it 's a dream come true			0
obviously i was very excited to make my debut , and to score as well is what i dreamed of as a little kid , ' @entity0 told @entity43			1
' it was a special night , a proud night , and one i wo n't be forgetting for a while			0
' many goal - scoring debutants have seen their @entity1 careers quickly fizzle out into nothing			1
@entity50 and @entity51 found the net on their first appearances and never played for their country again			0
@entity57 took four minutes to break his international duck against the @entity59 in 2005			0
he scored again 40 minutes later , but never started another game for the @entity1			1
@entity1 boss @entity61 will decide if @entity0 starts against @entity62 in their friendly on tuesday @entity51 scored a solitary goal against @entity65 but was never selected for @entity1 again @entity57 scored twice against the @entity59 in 2005 , the last time he pulled on an @entity1 shirt @entity67 to read how the @entity19 striker fared on his @entity1 bow @entity61 believes @entity0 is here to stay , though , and the player himself is desperate to earn more caps			1
' this is where i want to be , playing for @entity1 and scoring goals , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's my first taste of it and i loved it and hopefully i can keep doing well for club and country and see where it takes us			0
' @entity82 's withdrawal through injury increased @entity0 's chances of starting against @entity62 in @entity85			1
and the striker is ready to answer @entity61 's call if needed			1
' that 's down to the boss , but i 'll be ready , raring to go if called upon			0
i will be looking forward to it , ' @entity0 said			2
' the lads have picked up some really good results home and away			0
we continued that against @entity8 and now we have a tough game coming up , but we are full of confidence			2
' if @entity61 brought @entity0 into the starting line - up , he would have to dispense with the 4 - 3 - 3 formation that worked so well against @entity8 , unless he started @entity100 as one of the two wide - men alongside @entity0			1
he is more likely to switch to a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond , with @entity0 and @entity100 up front as a strike partnership			1
@entity0 's chances of facing @entity62 were raised after @entity82 was forced to withdraw with injury the @entity19 striker could form a partnership with @entity100 after replacing the captain on friday @entity61 was giving little away about team selection for @entity62 , but he accepts he will face increasing calls for @entity0 to start after his stunning debut			1
' if i listened to clamour every time then a lot of players would be playing from the start in the next game , ' said @entity61 , who has also released @entity13 , @entity119 and @entity120 from his squad			2
' people come and go but i think @entity0 is here to stay			2
' it could well happen ( that @entity0 starts )			2
we wo n't have @entity13 and @entity82 so his chances increase all the time			2
' @entity61 was keen not to burden the youngster with even more pressure although he admits the forward 's debut could not have gone any better			2
' the word fairytale comes to mind and it 's great when fairytales come true in this way , ' @entity61 added			0
' i 'm delighted for him , he 's had a good week in training and we 've been quite excited to see him			0
' but let 's keep things in perspective , for him it 's been a whirlwind romance for him in terms of playing top - class football and , if anything , i would like to try and relieve the pressure on him rather than heap pressure on him			0
' @entity149 defender @entity148 ( right ) has been called up as cover for @entity151 the 20 players left in the squad were given the rest of saturday off after a morning warm - down session and team meeting			0
they will train again on sunday , when @entity148 will join in after being called up as back - up for @entity151			0
seven of the 17 players left in the squad are yet to reach 10 caps , so @entity61 knows stretching @entity1 's winning streak to eight matches will be difficult			1
' it will be an enormous test for the ones we put in because some of them wo n't have played in the national team for a long time and they are going to be playing against a top team , but we need a good squad going forward and we need competition for places , ' @entity61 said .			0

@entity0 scored on his @entity1 debut in 4 - 0 defeat of @entity8
@entity19 striker is eager for more and could face @entity62 in tuesday friendly
with @entity82 out injured , @entity61 will decide if @entity0 partners @entity100 up front
