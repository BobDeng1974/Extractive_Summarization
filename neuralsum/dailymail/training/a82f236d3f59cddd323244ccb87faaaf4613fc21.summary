@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 ’ @entity2 , said offenders are walking away with just a caution drug dealers who sell cannabis outside school gates are escaping with nothing more than a slap on the wrist , the @entity2 warned last night			1
other serious offenders who are being let off with a caution or fine include serial burglars , muggers and even rapists			2
instead of being hauled before a court , they walk away with a caution , fixed penalty notice or so - called community resolution			2
@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 ’ @entity2 , said the revelations would lead the public to wonder if the justice system was ‘ broken ’			1
in evidence to mps , he said magistrates believed that between 30 and 35 per cent of out - of - court disposals were being administered ‘ inappropriately ’			0
they fear police officers are looking to settle cases ‘ quickly ’ – but with no regard to trying to change a criminal ’s ways			1
he gave the disturbing example of drug pushers being given only a cannabis warning , which was supposed to be for people caught with a small amount of the @entity39 substance			1
recent studies have warned the drug can inflict enormous harm on young minds – with teenagers who smoke it at much greater risk of addiction and psychosis than adults			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it is right somebody picked up on the street with a spliff should be given a cannabis warning , but should somebody caught selling drugs outside a school ? because they are			1
’ a cannabis warning does not even constitute a formal criminal record			1
police had previously insisted drug users – especially those stood close to schools - would not be eligible for a cannabis warning			1
guidance drawn up by chief constables states the sanction ‘ does not apply to offences of possession with intent to supply cannabis or any other supply offence			0
’ appearing before the home affairs select committee , mr @entity0 went on : ‘ when you start seeing people being cautioned for multiple robberies , multiple burglaries , you start to think , is not there something going wrong here ? he said drug dealers were only being given a cannabis warning , which was supposed to be for people caught with a small amount of the @entity39 substance ‘ that is when the public start to think , is this system broken ? ’ mr @entity0 said another example was rape , which would make people think ‘ how on earth is that given an out - of - court disposal ’ ? ’ since 2010 , at least 90 rapists have been punished with a caution , even though the offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment			1
mr @entity0 said that , in some cases , a crime which is reported as a rape is downgraded by the police until it becomes a sexual assault or other lesser offence			1
officers then consider it more suitable for a slap - on - the - wrist sanction			0
police had previously insisted drug users , especially those stood close to schools , would not be eligible for a cannabis warning he said there are a number of reasons why cautions are being given out when a case should be brought before magistrates , at the very least			1
he told @entity117 : ‘ there has been an issue with a target culture and an issue with the fact out - of - court disposals are covered by guidance rather than statutory provision			0
there are 43 chief constables who will all interpret it in a different way to suit their own areas			0
’ he added that some police saw the punishment as a way of dealing with an offence ‘ quickly , never mind stopping the offender ’s behaviour ’			2
in total over the past four years , police have issued almost 15,000 cautions for offences that would typically result in jail – including 2,279 for sexual assault , 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary			0
in 1971 , only 6 per cent of offenders were given a caution , which carries no sanction except a reprimand			2
the figure reached 20 per cent by last year , though this was down from 31 per cent in 2007			0
there were 181,000 cautions issued last year which meant the offender avoided being hauled before the courts – including 29,560 handed out to criminals by the @entity156			0
a quarter of offences of violence againt the person are dealt with by a caution , along with 17.4 per of sex attacks , 20 per cent of thieves and almost 40 per cent of those guilty of criminal damage and arson			0
@entity167 chief constable @entity166 , who speaks for the police service on out of court disposals , insisted they had a valuable role to play when used properly			2
she told the @entity117 that , since 2007 , the percentage of all crimes solved which were dealt with in this way had fallen from 10 per cent to 4.8 per cent .			0

@entity0 says public will wonder if justice system is ' broken '
magistrates fear police are looking to settle cases ' quickly ' without helping
police insisted drug users would not be eligible for a cannabis warning
since 2010 , at least 90 rapists have been punished with a caution , he warns
