pornography is to be banned from public wi - fi networks by the end of the year , @entity2 ’s children ’s czar said last night			1
@entity6 said the move was vital to prevent children from stumbling across adult material when using wireless internet networks in places such as cafes and railway stations – or seeing others who may be downloading it			1
but one of the country ’s largest internet providers has threatened to throw a spanner in the works by warning that ministers ’ plans to block porn from public wi - fi could be against the law			2
the move is intended to stop children from viewing porn online when in public @entity28 was accused of ‘ dragging its heels ’ over an agreement to filter its public wi - fi services by raising at the last minute its concerns that it could open itself to legal challenges			1
the company claims blocking adult material from stores which use @entity28 public wi - fi could breach 2000 legislation which bans the interception of electronic communications			1
last year the @entity41 revealed that coffee chain @entity42 , which uses @entity28 , had failed to filter adult material from its free wi - fi – putting children of seeing obscene porn on other customers ’ tablets or mobile phones			1
@entity42 has now imposed a filter			0
but mrs @entity6 , the prime minister ’s children ’s czar , said she was still hopeful that hardcore porn would be filtered out of all public wi - fi networks by the end of the year			1
the six largest providers of public @entity44 – accounting for 96 per cent of coverage – have agreed to put adult content block in place			2
@entity28 has been accused of ' dragging its heels ' about the move after they saw problems with it @entity64 companies offering free wi - fi from one of the six companies , which includes @entity28 , would then be encouraged to put the block in place to protect children using mobile phones and tablets like @entity73			1
these shops would be able to display a ‘ family friendly ’ logo so parents know their children will be safe			2
mrs @entity6 , mr @entity2 ’s adviser on children , said : ‘ i ’m really pleased that the internet industry is committed to providing public wi - fi that is free of adult content			1
it is entirely appropriate and means that children can surf the web safely in thousands of different places			2
‘ now we need to move fast in introducing family - friendly home internet filtering to make sure that our young people are not accessing violent and pornographic images			0
‘ the terrible recent story of the teenage girl raped by boys who had become addicted to internet porn only underpins how important these changes are			0
’ children 's czar @entity6 said that the move was vital to prevent children from stumbling across adult material when using wireless internet networks last month the prime minister hinted that action was on the cards when he said : ‘ we are promoting good , clean , @entity44 in local cafes and elsewhere to make sure that people have confidence in public @entity44 systems so that they are not going to see things they should n’t			1
’ the web companies agreed to raise their game at the latest meeting of the @entity112 , which brings together children ’s charities with ministers and the online industry			0
however , no timetable has yet been set but it is hoped the blocks will be in place by the end of the year			0
the six firms are @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity28 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
and minutes of the meeting , held last month , reveal that @entity28 is dragging its heels over the changes			1
@entity131 , the representative from @entity132 , said : ‘ there is considerable nervousness that filtering content could be regarded as intercepting data , and which could put providers in breach of the @entity139			0
’ the @entity140 allows certain public bodiesto intercept data for national security reasons – but bans everyone else from doing so			0
@entity28 ’s argument is that filtering web use without the user ’s express permission could be regarded as the interception of data			1
but children ’s charities say the @entity140 only applies to emails and other personal information , not the sites people are able to visit			0
one campaigner present at the meeting said : ‘ people were completely astonished at @entity28 ’s timidity			2
but equally the fact that the government seem to be dragging their feet hardly inspires confidence			0
’ @entity28 also raised the possibility of charging companies which use its public wi - fi service extra for imposing a filter			1
they said it would be on a cost recovery basis , and that they would not make a profit			0
but the campaigner said : ‘ filtering porn on @entity44 should be standard			0
nobody should have to pay extra to do the right thing			0
‘ that ’s how @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 do it			0
yet there was a suggestion that @entity28 were going to make it an optional , paid - for extra			2
’ a spokeswoman for @entity28 said : ‘ @entity28 , along with other internet service providers , supports the objectives of the government and our customers for providing a family friendly internet through the deployment of filtering solutions for adult and pornographic content in the home and with our wi - fi partners			2
‘ we have merely sought clarification regarding the potential legality of a particular approach to intercepting content in order to ensure that our customers , employees and shareholders are not put at risk			0
