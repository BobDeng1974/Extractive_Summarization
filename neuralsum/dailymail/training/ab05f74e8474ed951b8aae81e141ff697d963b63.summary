@entity1 minister @entity0 last night resigned from the @entity2 , claiming working with @entity3 was like ' walking through mud '			1
the maverick and conspiracy theorist claimed he could no longer work with the home secretary after the @entity8 blocked his report on decriminalising drugs			1
but his decision to resign had been planned with deputy prime minister @entity12 for months and timed to cause maximum damage to mrs may , who is under pressure over her bungled handling of the government 's child abuse inquiry			1
mr @entity0 will be replaced at the @entity2 by the international development minister @entity21 , who has previously worked under mrs may			1
he accused her of being ' soft on drugs ' for refusing to bow to his demands for reform of the law to decriminalise possession of drugs and target dealers			2
it suggested he had taken the decision to resign after last week 's public row over his report into drug laws around the world , which was suppressed for several months by the conservatives			1
however , mr @entity0 struck a secret deal with mr @entity12 in august to resign from his post at the point which would cause maximum damage to mrs may and her conservative colleagues			1
the home secretary was forced to eat humble pie in the @entity54 yesterday as she explained why not one but two people she had appointed to chair the inquiry into historic child abuse had been forced to resign			1
she said sorry for the child sex abuse inquiry debacle and admitted the government may have to look abroad for its third chairman			0
the home secretary insisted the resignation of @entity64 last week would not derail the inquiry , which will meet for the first time a week tomorrow without a chair – four months after it was announced			1
hours later , mr @entity0 gave an interview in which he claimed mrs may found it ' hard to accept ' that he was the @entity1 minister in her department , and he could no longer work with her			2
mr @entity0 , 57 , will remain as mp for @entity72 , where he is defending a majority of 7,647			2
mrs may brushed off the row and welcomed the return of @entity1 @entity21 to the @entity2 @entity3 remains the top choice as the next @entity29 leader among party members , a new survey showed today			1
a quarter of members ( 24 per cent ) surveyed by @entity81 back the home secretary , ahead of 22 per cent for @entity83 and @entity84 on 11 per cent			2
however , mrs may has slipped in the league table of cabinet ministers ' performance , down one place to sixth			1
it follows the ongoing problems with finding a chair for the child abuse inquiry and growing public unease about immigration			0
work and pensions secretary @entity95 is rated as the best performer , followed by mr @entity84 , chancellor @entity97 , commons leader @entity98 and health secretary @entity99			2
tories retaliated , accusing him of behaving like a ' @entity1 home secretary ' despite being a middle - ranking minister			1
but mr @entity0 told @entity102 : ' they have looked upon it as a @entity29 department in a @entity29 government , whereas in my view it 's a @entity108 department in a @entity108 government			1
' that mindset has framed things , which means i have had to work very much harder to get things done even where they are what the home secretary agrees with and where it has been helpful for the government and the department			2
' there comes a point when you do n't want to carry on walking through mud and you want to release yourself from that			0
' in his resignation letter to @entity1 leader @entity12 , mr @entity0 wrote : ' i regret that in the @entity2 , the goodwill to work collegiately to take forward rational evidence - based policy has been in somewhat short supply			1
' last night it was claimed mr @entity12 had tried to persuade him to stay			0
but mr @entity0 had agreed in august the plan to stay in post until the opportunity presented itself to resign			1
mr @entity12 has repeatedly clashed with mrs may , most recently when she claimed the @entity1 were putting children at risk by blocking the @entity135 , which would give police access to a person 's full internet history and who they have contact with on social media websites			1
mr @entity0 spent three years as a transport minister when the coalition was formed , and was a surprise choice for the @entity2 when he was appointed in october last year			2
he wrote a book in 2007 claiming weapons inspector dr @entity147 was murdered by an @entity149 hit squad , while the security services hushed it up			0
he has also claimed the death of former foreign secretary @entity153 was suspicious			0
mr @entity0 wrote a book claiming weapons inspector dr @entity147 was murdered by an @entity149 hit squad , while the spies hushed it up , and has claimed the death of former foreign secretary @entity153 was suspicious mr @entity0 said mrs may had found it ' hard to accept ' when he was given the role , but he added : ' to be fair to the home secretary , i think she takes the view she has to keep a tight leash on everything otherwise she would n't carry on as home secretary – she has been there four - and - a - half years			1
' i think she is quite competent and professional , and i have a lot of respect for her professionally			0
' he added : ' i just think it 's a pity that she took the mindset that the @entity1 had to be put up with , and we were almost a cuckoo in the nest rather than part of government			2
' however , the @entity8 accused mr @entity0 , a keen musician who is about to release his second album , of over-inflating his importance in one of the biggest government departments			0
@entity184 , a former @entity29 immigration minister , said mr @entity0 was like ' a guitarist who was only interested in his own solos while the rest of the band was trying to play a close harmony number '			2
he told @entity191 's today programme : ' @entity0 's problem was that he came in and announced , he gave an interview to his local paper , saying ' i am the @entity1 home secretary ' , he regarded himself as being on a par with the home secretary and asked for papers from other ministers			1
' he wanted to check what everyone else was doing			0
the world does n't work like that			0
if you are a minister of state , in the end , you work to the secretary of state in that department			0
' mr @entity0 sought to suggest the row over the drugs report was the final straw which forced his resignation			1
when asked about his public row with mrs may over drugs policy , he said : ' the phrase ' soft on drugs ' is used			0
what is soft on drugs ? i think being soft on drugs is pretending there is n't a problem , and this is being sorted			0
' if anyone is soft on drugs it 's my conservative colleagues , because they are the ones who allow the process to go on whereby drug dealers continue to make money and people continue to get fined and carry on taking drugs			0
' mr @entity0 last week hailed a @entity2 - commissioned report finding ' no obvious ' link between tough laws and levels of illegal drug use			2
he said the report meant the genie was out of the bottle and was not going back in			0
he said : ' i think the days of robotic , mindless rhetoric are over , because the facts and the evidence will no longer allow that			0
' but he was slapped down my @entity242 , who said : ' i do n't think anyone can read that report and say it definitely justifies this approach or that approach , but the evidence is what we 're doing is working			0
' i do n't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today			0
i 'm a parent with three children ; i do n't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is ok or safe			0

@entity0 claims working with home secretary is like ' walking through mud '
accuses may of behaving like the @entity29 won the *election*
suggests last week 's row over drugs reform *triggered* his resignation
but he agreed to resign with @entity12 in august but waited for months
conservatives accuse him of behaving like ' @entity1 home secretary '
he will be replaced at the @entity2 by @entity21
may still favourite as future @entity29 leader but slips in cabinet league table
