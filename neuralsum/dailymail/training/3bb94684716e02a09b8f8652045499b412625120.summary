most sportsmen will try to put a positive spin on things , no matter how bad they get			0
sometimes the truth is unpalatable			0
for manager @entity7 and his @entity9 players , however , the lessons of tuesday night ’s home defeat by @entity6 were clear			1
once again they had come up short and they head to @entity12 for a second leg on march 18 knowing something much , much better is required			0
so when @entity9 ’s @entity17 defender @entity16 was asked the key question , there was no great point trying to sugar - coat anything			1
@entity16 attempt to stop @entity22 in his tracks as the @entity6 forward goes on the attack the @entity9 defender was sent off in the second half as the home side pressed for an equaliser @entity30 had given @entity6 the lead from a tight angle after the ball fell kindly to him in the @entity9 box have @entity9 , @entity16 was asked , improved at all since last year ’s 2 - 0 defeat at home by @entity6 at this stage of the @entity38 ? ‘ it ’s hard to say that , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ if you look at this game they had more possession , created chances and we ran after the ball a lot			0
i do n’t know if we have improved since last year			0
‘ we are privileged to be in a club that wants to improve year after year			0
and to improve is to go further in the @entity38			2
twice in a row we have played @entity6			2
they are a big team and know how to play those kind of games			0
eventually we will get there			0
‘ those clubs have been built for several years — 20 , 30 , 40 years — and this is only the sixth season for us but that ’s no excuse			0
the owner wants to improve quickly , so we have to improve quickly			0
@entity30 celebrates the crucial first away goal after finishing emphatically past @entity59 @entity30 slides in ahead of @entity60 to flick @entity62 's cross past @entity59 to double the lead ‘ if we play as we did in the second half , everything is possible			1
it ’s not going to be easy , but we are going to try really hard			0
’ given that @entity16 had been sent off only an hour earlier , the former @entity69 player ’s honesty was welcome			2
@entity9 did improve after half - time but by then they were 2 - 0 down and all but out of the competition once again			1
goalkeeper @entity59 , whose last - minute penalty save from @entity22 prevented another @entity6 goal , admitted @entity9 had panicked when their plan to suffocate @entity6 high up the field failed			1
@entity9 ’s owners — and @entity7 — face a conundrum in that while few really thought they would beat @entity6 , improvement is expected			1
and currently it is hard for @entity7 to suggest there has been any			2
@entity83 fires past @entity84 to put @entity9 back in the game @entity83 celebrates with @entity86 after scoring what could turn out to be a vital goal in the context of the tie with 20 minutes to go @entity9 bought three players last summer			1
@entity93 has not managed to displace @entity94 at full back , @entity92 would perhaps not have played on tuesday had @entity96 not been suspended , and £ 30million - plus @entity17 defender @entity97 has been the biggest disappointment of all			2
football director @entity100 heads @entity9 ’s recruitment team and must accept some responsibility			2
@entity7 , however , will ultimately feel the greatest pressure			2
there is no question mark over his future right now but this is a club with a very clear idea of where it wants to get to and when			0
some may question @entity7 ’s decision to play 4 - 4 - 2 on tuesday			1
@entity9 looked short in central midfield where @entity92 and @entity86 had a dreadful evening			2
more startling was the way @entity9 seemed to have learned so little from last year			2
as @entity6 picked them apart in the first half , it was with the same tactics we witnessed a year ago			0
@entity7 will thank no - one for saying it , but it ’s hard to imagine a team coached by @entity122 being dismantled like this			1
@entity9 were beaten 2 - 0 at the @entity124 by @entity6 in last season 's last - 16 @entity7 's side were reduced to 10 men in that game too after @entity129 ‘ i have played @entity6 many times and even if you played five in the middle you always feel a player short because they know how to move , how to keep the ball , ’ added @entity16			1
‘ the choice of the manager to go from the first minute with two strikers showed we wanted to play offensively and score goals			0
we did n’t , and we did n’t start well			0
‘ we have to carry on like this because that is the way we want to play and that is the way we are going to win things			0
’ @entity9 must now forget @entity6			1
the return leg is three weeks away and on sunday they travel to @entity146 for a @entity148 meeting with @entity149			1
last season @entity149 won this fixture 3 - 2 but they are in @entity151 tonight and @entity9 ’s two days of extra rest may give them the edge			1
the @entity148 is safe and familiar territory for @entity9			1
sooner or later , however , @entity7 must find a way to expand his team ’s horizons			0
@entity9 ’s match statistics were similar in some respects to those from last season ’s performance against @entity6			1
they had one more shot on target on tuesday ( 4 ) than in last season ’s match at the @entity124 and the same number of shots off target ( 4 )			1
their possession was up on last season , though still low — 37.9 per cent compared to 31.6 per cent in 2014			0
however , they did get 20 crosses into the penalty area as opposed to 11 last season and had eight corners on tuesday night against one in 2014			1
@entity177 @entity6 ’s passing success rate was down on the same fixture last year — 88.9 per cent of 686 passes compared to 92.4 per cent in 2014			0
this was largely down to @entity30 , who scored two goals but found a team - mate with only 72.7 per cent of his passes			1
without his erratic input , @entity6 ’s average was 90.3 per cent .			0
