' @entity0 ' and ' mesmerising ' are n’t words you often hear in the same sentence			0
but these dancing shapes , created by student @entity5 , could change your view on the beauty hidden in numbers			1
mr @entity5 ’s gifs have been swirling , bouncing and twisting their way around the internet for a number of years – but his latest creations are the most spellbinding yet			1
the @entity15 - based student began a @entity16 called @entity17 in 2011 on which he published his own quirky @entity19 drawing inspiration from films			1
but then he stumbled on an open source programming language called processing , which is designed to help people create images and animations			1
' i was initially inspired by @entity28 / , i was absolutely blown away when i discovered his work first , ' mr @entity5 told @entity30			2
' my first geometric @entity31 were shameless imitations of his			0
' using his background in mathematics and physics , mr @entity5 began exploring something known as motion geometry to create fascinating shapes			1
in this series , his minimalistic use of shapes and colour draw attention to motion , symmetry and ordered patterns			1
processing is an open source language designed to help people create images and animations			1
it was initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals using images			2
but the software has now evolved			0
today , it is used by artists , designers , researchers , and hobbyists who to create animations and test out their prototype designs			2
from a hexagon wave , to moving coloured cubes and rainbow spirals , each of the student 's designs reveal structured rules drawn from equations			0
mr @entity5 is keen to share his methods and frequently posts source code and tips to help other artists on @entity75			2
' my process is basically that i come up with a fully - formed idea and try to get it into @entity81 form before i 've forgotten it , ' said mr @entity5			1
' after a quick sketch in pen ( and sometimes a bit of trigonometry ) i code the @entity81 the programming language processing			1
' he is now focusing more on his artistic side of his work , using maths to create designs that are both beautiful and hypnotising			0
the designer claims to be able to see his animation before he creates them			0
he then makes changes to colour , timing and measurements during the production process			0
' i can see the @entity81 format itself dying in the future : it was standardised in the 80s and feels like it , ' said mr @entity5			2
' for most uses you end up with very big files or very low quality			0
but it 's so widely supported so it 'll be a while before it 's gone			0
' but as far as people making short little abstract animations , i ca n't see any reason why they 'd ever stop , even if we need to switch to a more modern format			0
' more animations can be seen on mr @entity5 ’s @entity16 blog , which archives his work to date .			1

the animations were created by @entity15 - based student @entity5
his aim was to explore the hypnotic beauty and patterns in numbers
they were produced using programming language called processing
by using basic shapes and colours , the @entity132 draw attention to motion
