the political @entity0 erupted into guffaws saturday after a women 's lifestyle magazine published a soft profile of @entity6 journalist @entity5 – the wife of @entity9 press secretary @entity8 – and applied ham - fisted photoshop edits to a photo of the family bookshelf			1
now it 's not so empty			0
the photograph shows @entity8 and @entity5 standing in front of a briefing podium , miming the routine of a press conference by taking questions from their enthusiastic children			1
the bookshelf is situated behind them			0
a dozen or more cut - and - paste operations later , 12 - year - old @entity24 's left pinky finger wound up halfway across the room , left behind when a book jacket was cloned			1
that 's just the most obvious edit			0
@entity8 , @entity5 and their children staged a mock press conference for @entity34 magazine , in front of a bookshelf that included a copy of ' @entity38 ' ( next to the @entity39 bobblehead , 4th shelf r ) amateur @entity42 sleuths tore the image apart on saturday , mocking the horrible @entity45 job which left @entity46 with the impression that president @entity49 's spokesman is n't well - read enough to have a sizable library of his own ( note the extra finger , 2nd shelf r ) @entity53 found 12 separate photoshop edits , each involving replacing a blank space with a book , leaving readers with the impression that @entity8 and @entity5 are better - read than they actually are			1
have you seen this finger ? this is what happens when bad @entity65 attack @entity8 's office did n't respond to a request for comment			1
neither did @entity70 @entity34 magazine , which published the story , titled ' @entity72			1
' a journalist who has visited @entity8 's home in a wealthy neighborhood of @entity73 told @entity53 that the home is n't bereft of reading material , and it would have been easy to find enough books to fill the shelf instead of faking it later			1
@entity5 , in fact , told the magazine some of her favorite things to read , including ' @entity85 ' and ' @entity86 : portrait of a woman			2
' ' i always have a pile , ' she said			0
' i hate to be without books			0
knowing i have a bunch makes me happy			0
a good book and a good chocolate bar ! ' or several identical good books			0
@entity34 snapped this cover shot of the @entity99 kitchen , and an astute @entity101 convention - goer spotted the red @entity38 - propaganda artwork ( next to @entity104 ) attendees of the @entity101 @entity106 guffawed at the sight of @entity8 and @entity5 's suddenly multiplying book collection			1
@entity8 art : @entity111 's famous poster asked ' have you enlisted in the @entity113 ? ' and challenged @entity115 workers about their commitment to the @entity117 and the @entity38 communist party ' that 's about right , ' quipped a woman from @entity121 who said her name was @entity123			1
' @entity125 books , phony answers , phony @entity9			2
anyone surprised ? ' her husband squinted at a laptop and pointed to a book positioned between a @entity115 matryoshka doll and a @entity39 bobble - head			0
' does that say " @entity38 ? " he asked			2
' it does , ' does n't it ? ' @entity135 , another conservative in attendance at saturday 's cattle call for @entity140 presidential hopefuls , spotted a poster in the @entity143 kitchen – shown in another @entity34 picture – that 's a take - off on @entity38 propaganda art. ' i know that picture , ' said the visitor from @entity149			1
' the original @entity115 poster asked , " have you volunteered ? " it 's sort of like " @entity153 , " only for communists			2
' right - wing @entity42 denizens rocketed the bookshelf photo around the internet on saturday , alternatively taking and sharing credit for the discovery that the image was heavily edited			0
@entity162 , a popular best - of - @entity42 feed , collected the snark			0
the mocking grew loudest when young @entity24 's duplicate pinky was discovered			0
they even forgot to erase the kid 's finger in the fake book photoshop , ' read one tweet			2
' pfft ! like you do n't use kids ' fingers for bookends , ' came a reply			0
red - meat conservatives on hand in @entity101 to see right - wing luminaries like @entity181 sen. @entity180 ( @entity182 ) and @entity184 sen. @entity183 ( r ) chuckled at the wayward images of @entity8 's @entity73 home			1

@entity9 press secretary 's wife *allowed* @entity34 magazine to photograph the couple in their tony @entity73 home
one picture shows the pair miming a *playful* press conference where they field questions from their two young children
the bookshelf *backdrop* was n't full enough , so the mag photoshopped duplicates , including one that left an extra finger belonging to @entity8 's *son*
conservatives *cackled* at the idea that @entity8 might not be well - read enough to have a full library without faking the picture
attendees at the @entity215 guffawed and then noticed what looks like a @entity38 propaganda poster hanging in @entity8 's kitchen
