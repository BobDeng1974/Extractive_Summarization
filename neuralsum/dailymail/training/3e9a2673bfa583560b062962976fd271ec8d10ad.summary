by @entity0 effective officer on patrol or laughing stock ? chief supt @entity4 of @entity5 , pictured , is considering using segways to patrol the city centre police force bosses considering patrolling the streets of @entity10 on two - wheeled segways have been warned it will turn their officers into a ' laughing stock '			1
@entity5 bosses are considering buying two of the self - balancing electric vehicles , complete with @entity5 livery , sirens and blue flashing lights , to help them police the city centre			1
the vehicles , which have a maximum speed of 12mph , cost around £ 5,000 each , but the force , which has tested two vehicles loaned from a company in @entity28 at the @entity5 headquarters , is said to be considering a sponsorship deal			1
divisional commander chief supt @entity4 tweeted a picture of himself riding one of the @entity11 and said : ' to increase visibility and accessibility to officers in the city of @entity10 , i want to introduce @entity11			1
good idea ? ' he said ' we are looking at the feasibility of how successful they would be			1
we might rent first and give them a try			0
' i think it is something we can do to increase visibility and approachability			2
we are increasing our suite of bicycles anyway but some areas are not suitable for bikes - like @entity53 or the @entity54 ' a police officer can cover a greater distance quicker , and officers would be on a raised platform to improve visibility			2
' they are pretty easy to use once you get used to them and they proved very popular with other officers when we tested them			0
' however @entity65 users were quick to pour scorn on the idea , with one suggesting bicycles might be ' healthier and more accessible ' and another saying : ' could n't they just walk ? ' one @entity72 shopkeeper was more forthright , however , calling the plan ' a daft idea '			1
the man , who asked not to be named , said : ' it will turn the police into a laughing stock			0
can you imagine them chasing down the criminals in @entity10 on one of those ? ' he added : ' they will look like that guy in the @entity87 film @entity86 - the only way they will catch someone is because the offender will fall about laughing			0
' sorry , it might work in @entity93 , but it wo n't work here			0
' @entity5 said the plan was under consideration while they considered the practical and legal implications , and no decision had yet been taken			2
segways were trialled by police in the south @entity101 borough of @entity102 in 2007 , but @entity104 officials decided not to use them after the trial showed they were rarely used and were also illegal to use on the road			2
one wag suggested the @entity5 officers on @entity11 would resemble @entity86 in the @entity86 comedy , pictured first unveiled in @entity111 in 2001 , segways were invented by @entity112 after he designed an all - terrain electric wheelchair called an @entity114			1
segways operate purely by balance , and riders stand upright and control the vehicle through tall handlebars			0
immortalised in the 2009 hit movie @entity86 : @entity86 , they are used across the world at theme parks , tourist attractions , shopping centres and by security guards on housing estates			0
invented in 2001 , segways work using the rider 's balance to control speed and direction in @entity132 , segways are illegal to use on pavements and do not meet regulations designed for electric bikes , so they can not be used on roads as motor vehicles either			1
however adventure companies in the @entity132 advertise @entity140 ' experience ' days for thrill - seekers , usually in forest settings			2
in 2010 @entity143 , the @entity132 multi-millionaire who owned @entity140 , which makes segways , died in a freak accident while riding one of his vehicles			1
mr @entity143 , who was 62 , apparently lost control of his segway while riding it on his estate near @entity150 , @entity151			0
he and his all - terrain @entity11 were found in the @entity152 which ran 80ft below a cliff on his estate , leading police to suspect he had been riding the vehicle when he fell off the cliff and into the river below			0
@entity143 died in a freak accident while riding a @entity11 on his estate near @entity150 , @entity151			0
