by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:03 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 04:29 est , 22 august 2013 the next @entity2 will come in gold , according to the latest @entity5 rumours			1
@entity7 columnist @entity6 said he has heard by ' multiple sources ' there will be a gold @entity10			1
a gold option had first been suggested in may when leaked parts of the new @entity2 were shown to be markedly different from those in the current model			1
the @entity2 is currently only available in black and white			0
while the current @entity2 only comes in black and silver , companies such as @entity16 can customise your @entity2 to look gold ( pictured ) @entity20 uses a chemical process called anodisation that creates the desired colour change			1
@entity24 is currently one of the most popular after - market colour adjustments for @entity27 the parts included the loud - speaker bracket , ear speaker bracket , vibrating motor assembly , @entity34 flex cable ribbon and sim card tray - which were in both silver and gold			1
last week @entity37 from @entity38 outlined why a gold @entity2 could be a good move for @entity5			1
according to @entity40 ’s @entity39 , making a gold @entity2 is much simpler than making one that is black because it ’s an easier colour to anodise			1
the process involves a straightforward chemical reaction , with the possible addition of dye depending on the exact colour needed			0
@entity24 is also one of the most popular after - market colour adjustments for current iphones , including gold cases			1
the sim card trays appear to show handsets being made in multiple colours - including silver and gold ‘ given how popular gold is as an aftermarket option for colour - treatments , and how many gold cases there are - including but certainly not limited to the @entity63 markets - it could simply be the decision to offer supply where there 's demand , ’ said mr @entity37			1
@entity6 from @entity7 believes that the colour could be more champagne than gold , similar to the old gold @entity71 mini			0
however , he also notes , that this model of the @entity71 was the shortest - lived			0
the new generation @entity2 expected to be launched on september 10 will run new software @entity75 and possibly include a finger - print scanner @entity5 is set to officially unveil the new generation iphone at an event next month , insiders say			1
it is believed the event , allegedly on september 10 , will see the launch of the upcoming @entity10 and possibly also a rumoured @entity84 ' low - cost ' device			1
last week , @entity86 website believes it has confirmation that the successor to @entity2 will be called the @entity10 , and that @entity5 ’s rumoured low - cost @entity2 will be known as the @entity84			1
the website @entity89 said that its ' sources in @entity63 ' have confirmed the names , which have long been under speculation			0
the c in the @entity84 is thought to stand for ' colour ' which could suggest that the phone will come in a range of colours , rather than the standard black and white options			2
other rumoured updates on the new @entity10 include an slow - motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest @entity106 implied a scanner function			2
it has been rumoured that @entity5 will launch a low - cost device , the plastic - case @entity84 , to target mid- and emerging markets the code describes a user touching the home button with their thumb			1
a fingerprint then appears on the screen , that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the ' recognition is complete '			0
more code discovered in @entity75 suggests phones running the software will be able to record video at a rate of 120 frames - per - second ( @entity125 ) rather than around 30 frames per second			0
this is fast enough to allow @entity2 users to create slow - motion films			2
the @entity75 software also lets users swipe between menus , select apps and control the device 's screen using just head movements			0
a string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of @entity5 's @entity75 software , pictured , gives the strongest indication to date that either the @entity10 or the @entity141 could have a fingerprint scanner when the @entity145 feature is enabled , it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps			2
when the required section is highlighted , users can move their head to the left to select it			0
other new features include @entity154 in @entity155 that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark			0
the new @entity106 software for @entity2 includes a radical redesign of menus and icons as well as improved notifications and better photo - organising abilities			2
a niche gadget designer has created the world 's most expensive @entity2 from gold , white diamonds and a rare £ 9million black diamond			2
craftsman @entity170 created a 24 - carat gold smartphone with an @entity5 logo encrusted with 53 sparkling jewells			0
the phone is now worth £ 10million			0
mr @entity170 , who develops ' exclusive , elite gadgets ' , was approached by a mysterious businessman from @entity177 who he refers to as ' @entity178 '			0
the unidentified millionaire travelled to @entity180 to meet the niche designer with a rare 26 carat black diamond that forms the centrepiece			0
the hand - crafted @entity2 is encrusted with a jaw - dropping 600 white diamonds and the sapphire glass screen contains 135 grams of 24 - carat gold			1
this one of a kind solid gold , black diamond encrusted @entity2 is said to be the most expensive in the world			2
