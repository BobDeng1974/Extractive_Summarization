by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today refused to apologise for his handling of the @entity5 privatisation , despite mounting criticism that he sold it off on the cheap			2
the business secretary said apologising was the ' last thing ' he intended to do , and insisted the government has achieved its ' key objectives ' in floating the firm for £ 3.5billion but @entity14 said it has been a ' first class disaster ' that has seen taxpayers ' short changed ' out of hundreds of millions			1
@entity17 business secretary @entity2 refused to apologise for his handling of the @entity5 sell - off in a damning report today the @entity19 claimed the taxpayer got a raw deal from the sell - off			1
the government ’s spending watchdog said the controversial privatisation was ‘ marked by deep caution , the price of which was borne by the taxpayer ’			2
in october , the @entity5 was floated on the stock market at a price of £ 3.3billion			1
today it is worth £ 5.6billion – a gap of £ 2.3billion			1
on the first day of trading , about £ 750million ‘ flowed to the new shareholders ’ – mainly @entity36 investors who benefited from an instant 38 per cent share price rise			1
the @entity19 concludes : ‘ @entity40 could have achieved better value for the taxpayer			1
' rise : @entity5 is now worth £ 5.6billion - £ 2.3billion more than its initial value mr @entity2 was called to the @entity44 to answer an urgent question on the sell - off , where he faced calls to admit he was wrong			1
but the @entity17 minister told @entity49 : ' the last thing i intend to do is apologise			0
what i do intend to do is to refer to what the report actually said as opposed to the spinning and the froth that is being generated around me			0
' he said the @entity25 had achieved its key objectives by delivering short and long - term benefits , including £ 2 billion from the sale , 690,000 shares owned by the public , and the largest employee share scheme in more than 30 years			1
in the long term , he said the ' ongoing risk to the taxpayer ' had been reduced by the privatisation			0
but @entity69 , @entity14 's shadow business secretary , said : ' you know it 's @entity72 when a report is published by the @entity19 saying ' the department could have achieved better value for the taxpayer ' and then ministers go out on to the media and then come to this @entity79 and then declare their privatisation a success			1
last night @entity82 mp , chairman of the @entity83 , accused the @entity40 of having ‘ had no clue what it was doing ’			0
describing the sale as a ‘ second - class performance ’ , she said : ‘ it is clear to me the @entity40 under - sold the taxpayer when it privatised @entity5			0
’ but business minister @entity90 dismissed the criticism , saying : ‘ hindsight is a wonderful thing			0
’ he added : ‘ we were cautious to avoid the risk of this transaction falling over			0
if we had put it on the market at a much higher price , we would have been left with a fatally damaged @entity5			1
’ today ’s @entity19 report says the government met its ‘ primary objective ’ of selling the postal giant before the election in may 2015			1
but it also lays bare the extent to which the @entity36 hit the jackpot from the sale – and damningly concludes the government should cut its reliance on @entity36 advisers before any future flotations			0
when the shares went on the market , private investors were allowed to buy a maximum of £ 750 worth , but an exclusive group of 16 of the @entity36 ’s biggest names were given ‘ priority ’ status and allowed to buy up to £ 46million worth each			1
criticism : @entity82 mp , chairman of the @entity83 , accused @entity25 of having ' no clue what it was doing ' but business minister @entity90 said : ' hindsight is a wonderful thing ' when the @entity5 floated last year , business secretary @entity2 said he was looking for long - term stability from ‘ the right kind of investor community ’			2
as a result , 16 of the @entity36 ’s investment giants were singled out from the 796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status			0
this group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £ 46million worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £ 600,000 and £ 6million worth			2
but few of the ‘ priority ’ investors – believed to include @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , and @entity144 – have been as long - term in their approach as mr @entity2 had hoped			2
the @entity19 said : ‘ almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks			2
’ in one example , @entity149 bought nearly 12million shares in october , but now owns just 118,480			0
speaking to mps in october , business secretary @entity2 justified the arrangement by saying he wanted to attract ‘ the right kind of investor community ’ , which was about ‘ long - termism ’			0
but today ’s report reveals many of the ‘ priority ’ investors then rushed to sell their shares , making themselves a fortune as the share price rocketed from £ 3.30 to more than £ 6			1
of the 16 , six had sold 100 per cent of their shares ‘ within the first few weeks of trading ’ , according to the @entity19			2
yesterday mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale			0
‘ the report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high			0
’ @entity173 , head of the @entity19 , said the @entity40 had been ‘ very keen ’ to sell @entity5 in order to prevent the company becoming a burden on the taxpayer			2
but he added : ‘ its approach , however , was marked by deep caution , the price of which was borne by the taxpayer			0
’ in order to sell the business , the @entity19 said @entity5 ’s £ 8.6billion pension black hole had also been given to the taxpayer			1
while it has received £ 28.8billion of assets from the pension fund , it has also been left with £ 37.4billion of liabilities , which are the pension promises made to @entity5 ’s workers			0
last year , it emerged that @entity192 , one of the banks which ran the sale on behalf of the government , had considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered from £ 3.30 to £ 3.50 just days before the flotation			2
but it then decided the move was too risky , and warned mr @entity2 against increasing the share price – advice which he followed			1
@entity203 , chief executive of @entity204 , the investment bank which advised the government on the sale , insisted it was the ‘ maximum price achievable ’ at the time			0
mr @entity203 said : ‘ there was no clear ability to go above £ 3.30 at that particular time			0
’ last night , @entity5 shares were worth £ 5.63 each .			1

postal *service* was floated on stock market in october , valued at £ 3.3bn
today it 's worth £ 5.6bn and investors have benefited from share price hike
@entity19 claim it was priced too cheaply and could have achieved ' better value for taxpayers '
