they also all have fantastic voices – with @entity15 , who is blind , possessing pitch - perfectness , a skill envied by musicians around the world and singer @entity20 ’s @entity13 working in her favour , with hyper - musicality an attribute of her disability			1
in the catchy electro - pop tune the @entity45 - based band sing : ' this is n't @entity29 i 'm not a novelty this is a real as it gets			1
' ‘ sometimes people treat us like we are little kids			0
we wanted to say we are not ; we are more than disabled people			0

‘ we are here to change opinions of disabled people in general , ’ she added			0
the band ’s producer @entity59 , who worked with the five women to write the songs on their upcoming album , said people have been surprised by the video			1
@entity15 is @entity35 ( far left ) , @entity20 is dressed as @entity30 ( second left ) , @entity40 is @entity41 ( centre ) , @entity36 is @entity37 ( first right ) and @entity38 is @entity39 ( far right ) @entity38 , 25 , who is dressed as @entity39 in the video , has @entity9			2
she wrote a brave song about heartbreak for the band 's album after her cousin committed suicide @entity15 , who is blind with a mild intellectual disability , is pitch - perfect and can identify any note she hears @entity36 , who has @entity10 and a mild intellectual disability , is tinkerbell in the video @entity40 , who has @entity10 with a mild intellectual disability , is @entity41			1
in the video she cuts off the @entity82 character 's famous long blonde locks ‘ when people think about a girl group with learning disabilities they paint a picture in their mind straight away			1
‘ but when they watch it they see it is not “ second class ” , they see it ’s not “ s * * t ” and they are surprised and they are like “ oh my god i actually like this			0
producer @entity59 worked with the band to write the songs and create an album ‘ we want people to really like it and get something out of it			1
’ @entity59 has been working with the band for four years , to get them to the point where their natural musical talents have created broadcast standard records			2
the sisters of invention describe their music as alternative pop and they write all of their songs from personal experience – both the happy and the heartbreaking			1
one of the brave stories of how they wrote their songs comes from @entity38 , who has @entity9			0
during the writing of their tenth song , she came into the studio with the heartbreaking news that her cousin who was ‘ as close as a sister to her ’ had committed suicide			0
she was just 14 - years - old			0
‘ @entity133 had lived with us since she was a baby and committed suicide			0
we were n’t expecting it			0
so we wrote a song about @entity133 , it ’s called @entity138 , ’ @entity38 said			0
‘ for a singer - songwriter to sit down and be brave enough to use that story and that experience in a song is incredible			0
‘ to put your ultimate truth and honesty directly in to those lyrics , there is nothing childish about it , ’ @entity59 explained			2
meanwhile , @entity15 used the time when her school principal told her parents she would never be able to learn anything as the basis of another song			1
@entity59 said when people talk about intellectual disability they start saying words like ‘ retard ’ and ‘ infantile ’			2
‘ they think that you will forever be a child			0
so for these girls to actually be singing gutsy , blatantly honest , emotionally mature songs and to sign them so beautifully that in itself is enough to make people go “ oh ”			1
’ the sisters of invention describe their music as alternative pop and they write all of their songs from personal experience they perform around 20 - 30 paid gigs every year and are set to release their first album in february the women have all been singing separately for years but got together as a group three years ago he hopes that next time people talk to someone with a learning disability they instead think ‘ i have no idea what your are capable of , you might be able to do something just as amazing as @entity7 ’			1
‘ here are five women who actually have a career as singer song - writers , ’ he added			0
