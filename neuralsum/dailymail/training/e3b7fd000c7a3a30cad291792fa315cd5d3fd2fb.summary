two sculptures that languished in obscurity for more than a century are to be unveiled today as the only surviving bronzes by @entity3 two sculptures that languished in obscurity for more than a century are to be unveiled today as the only surviving bronzes by @entity3			1
a team of international experts has used x-rays and a 500 - year - old sketch to build a portfolio of evidence to back the case that they are the works of the @entity14 master			1
the pair of sculptures – showing naked , muscular men riding triumphantly on two ferocious panthers – were made shortly after @entity3 completed the marble @entity20 and as he was about to begin painting the ceiling of the @entity22			1
@entity23 , keeper of the applied arts department of the @entity25 in @entity26 , where the pair will go on public display tomorrow , said the sculptures had been attributed to @entity3 following ' a @entity14 whodunnit ' investigation			1
' it has been fantastically exciting to have been able to participate in this ground - breaking project , which has involved input from many art historians in the @entity36 , @entity37 and the @entity38 , and to draw on evidence from conservation scientists and anatomists , ' she said			1
' the bronzes are exceptionally powerful and compelling works of art that deserve close - up study			1
we hope the public will come and examine them for themselves and engage with this ongoing debate			0
it has been a huge privilege to be involved , very exciting and great fun			0
' known as the @entity53 , the pieces are a metre tall and owned by a @entity36 private collector			1
one figure is older and lithe , the other young and athletic			0
dr @entity57 added : ' whoever made them clearly had a profound interest in the male body ... the anatomy is perfect			2
' the pair of sculptures show naked , muscular men riding triumphantly on two ferocious panthers the sculptures were made shortly after @entity3 completed the marble @entity20 , pictured in the @entity68 , @entity69 the works were attributed to @entity3 when they appeared in the collection of @entity72 in the 19th century			1
but since they were undocumented and unsigned , this claim was dismissed and over the past 120 years the bronzes have been attributed to other sculptors			2
but a neutron scan at a research institute in @entity79 placed the sculptures in the first decade of the 16th century			1
and studies by professor @entity82 , a clinical anatomist at the @entity84 , found the works bore all the hallmarks of @entity3			2
last autumn @entity87 , emeritus professor of art history at the @entity89 , connected the work to a drawing by one of @entity3 's apprentices now in the @entity95 museum of @entity96			2
in one corner is a composition of a muscular youth riding a panther , which is very similar in pose to the bronzes			1
the bronzes were compared with other works by @entity3 and found to be very similar in style and anatomy to his works of 1500 - 1510 ; a date confirmed by the preliminary conclusions of initial scientific analysis , including x-rays			1
research is continuing and the final conclusion will be presented in july			0
the bronzes will be on display until august 9			0
the four original surviving copies of the @entity117 have been brought together , pictured is 1215 painting ' @entity119 and the @entity117 ' the four original surviving copies of the @entity117 have been brought together under the same roof for the first time			2
the document - one of the first steps in the journey towards parliamentary democracy - will go on show at the @entity127 in central @entity128 as part of its 800th anniversary			2
more than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them with 1,215 winning the opportunity to visit the display			0
the documents will be at the library for three days before they are taken to the @entity138 for another day , before two are returned to the library and the others go back to their homes at @entity143 and @entity144			0
in a joint statement , the library and the cathedrals said : ' @entity119 could surely never have anticipated the enduring global legacy of @entity117 when he agreed to its terms in 1215			0
' eight hundred years later , the international interest and excitement about this unification event is testament to the extraordinary significance and symbolic power of these four manuscripts			0
' we are thrilled to be staging this moment in history together , as partners , at the start of the 800th anniversary year			0
for each of our institutions , this unique event marks the beginning of our own celebrations in 2015			0
' the @entity127 , @entity166 and @entity167 will all be staging exhibitions and events later this year to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of this iconic document			0
