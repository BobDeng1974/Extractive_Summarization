data : @entity1 , of @entity3 ’s @entity2 , admits there 's a margin of error the @entity3 climate scientists who claimed 2014 set a new record for global warmth last night admitted they were only 38 per cent sure this was true			1
in a press release on friday , @entity3 ’s @entity2 ( @entity2 ) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘ 2014 was the warmest year on record ’			1
the claim made headlines around the world , but yesterday it emerged that @entity2 ’s analysis – based on readings from more than 3,000 measuring stations worldwide – is subject to a margin of error			1
@entity3 admits this means it is far from certain that 2014 set a record at all			1
yet the @entity3 press release failed to mention this , as well as the fact that the alleged ‘ record ’ amounted to an increase over 2010 , the previous ‘ warmest year ’ , of just two - hundredths of a degree – or @entity33			1
the margin of error is said by scientists to be approximately @entity36 – several times as much			0
as a result , @entity2 ’s director @entity1 has now admitted @entity3 thinks the likelihood that 2014 was the warmest year since 1880 is just 38 per cent			1
however , when asked by this newspaper whether he regretted that the news release did not mention this , he did not respond			0
another analysis , from the @entity44 ( @entity46 ) project , drawn from ten times as many measuring stations as @entity2 , concluded that if 2014 was a record year , it was by an even tinier amount			2
@entity3 ’s @entity2 ( @entity2 ) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘ 2014 was the warmest year on record ’ its report said : ‘ numerically , our best estimate for the global temperature of 2014 puts it slightly above ( by @entity56 ) that of the next warmest year ( 2010 ) but by much less than the margin of uncertainty			1
‘ therefore it is impossible to conclude from our analysis which of 2014 , 2010 , or 2005 was actually the warmest year … the @entity62 ’s average temperature for the past decade has changed very little			1
’ scientists disagree over its significance , but there is little doubt that the rapid warming of the 1980s and early 1990s has slowed – although greenhouse gas emissions have surged			0
@entity70 , of the @entity71 on @entity72 , said the new figures showed the notion that global warming had ‘ stopped ’ was a ‘ myth ’ , although it had ‘ temporarily slowed ’			2
since 1951 , he added , the long - term trend was for warming of @entity79 per decade , and in his view , it would ‘ pick up again unabated ’ if emissions continued to rise			0
however , if the long - term rate is @entity85 per decade , this would mean the world would be 1c or so warmer by the end of the century , not @entity83 as some have claimed			0
climate sceptics insisted that the new figures showed the warming ‘ pause ’ had continued			2
dr @entity91 , of the @entity92 , said ‘ there has been no statistically significant warming trend since 1997 ’ – because the entire increase over this period was smaller than the error margin			2
dr @entity98 , associate professor of climate science at the @entity99 , said the past 15 years had seen a slightly slower rate of warming			0
but he added : ‘ you have to take a longer view , because 15 years is too short a period			0
we expect natural fluctuations , volcanic eruptions and changes in solar output to sometimes slow and sometimes increase warming rates			0
’ since 1880 , @entity62 ’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees @entity112 ( 0.8 degrees @entity113 ) , a trend that is largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet ’s atmosphere			0

@entity3 ’s @entity2 claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘ 2014 was the warmest year on record ’
but it emerged that @entity2 ’s analysis is subject to a margin of error
@entity3 admits this means it is far from certain that 2014 set a record at all
