@entity1 manager @entity0 returns to familiar surroundings on tuesday night although it 's a long , long time since he was in the @entity4 @entity0 managed @entity5 between 1987 and 1994 - landing the @entity7 title in his first season and adding the @entity9 a few years later - and his old club stand between the @entity11 and a place in the @entity14 quarter - finals			1
the team from the principality lead 3 - 1 after storming the @entity18 three weeks ago and with the second leg set up to be a cracker , we 've produced this picture special to mark the occasion and celebrate the early days of @entity0 's career as a boss			2
@entity25 was @entity0 's second club after a three - year spell at @entity28			0
he also managed @entity29 in @entity30 after @entity5 and moved to @entity1 in 1996			0
@entity0 got off to a flyer as @entity5 manager , winning the @entity7 title in 1988 to put the lid on a fine first season @entity0 worked with some huge names in @entity5 and is pictured giving instructions to @entity37 who played there from 1992 - 94 @entity41 pair @entity40 ( left ) and @entity42 arrived at @entity5 in 1987 @entity0 has @entity43 ( left ) on one side and @entity45 on the other as he takes his players on a jog during a 1991 training session @entity0 was in charge when @entity52 playmaker @entity51 joined @entity25 from @entity54 outfit @entity53 - he won the title in 1997 after @entity0 left @entity0 was hoisted high after guiding @entity5 to the @entity9 in 1991 - they beat @entity57 1 - 0 at the @entity58 in @entity59 @entity0 puts his players through their paces - making full use of the security barriers in the @entity4 in 1992 this one goes back a bit - it 's @entity0 playing @entity25 for @entity66 during a league game in 1978 @entity5 's training sessions were not always full pelt as @entity0 takes a breather during a session in 1990 midfielder @entity72 hugs @entity0 after @entity5 made the final of the 1992 @entity74 by beating @entity75 on away goals @entity0 kitted out for sessions in charge of his @entity5 players - that adidas gear ( right ) goes down a storm now with lovers of all things retro it would be fair to say @entity0 had some hair - raising moments during his time at @entity5 - if this picture from 1987 is anything to go by wenger with @entity90 - the @entity92 legend was manager of @entity93 when the current @entity11 boss was in charge of @entity5 @entity0 's assistant @entity96 was well named when sitting next to his boss in the @entity5 dugout			1
purple shell suits ? definitely 1989 this was @entity0 during his first match in @entity103 competition as @entity5 manager - a victory over @entity106 in 1988 @entity107 ' we can do it ' says @entity0 ahead of @entity5 crunch match			0

@entity0 goes back to the club he managed from 1987 until 1994
@entity0 's @entity1 side face @entity5 with a place in the quarter - final of the @entity14 at stake
the @entity11 go in to the clash at the @entity4 trailing 3 - 1 from the first leg in north @entity120
it will be @entity0 's first time at the @entity123 as an *opposition* manager
he won the @entity7 title during his first season there and added the @entity9 in 1991
