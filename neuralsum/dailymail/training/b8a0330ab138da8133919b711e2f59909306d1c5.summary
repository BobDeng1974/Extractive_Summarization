by @entity0 when @entity4 came on the scene in 2007 , the level of detail it provided astounded the world			1
but that was nothing compared to what the search engine could be offering in a few years , according to experts			0
the tech giant recently acquired @entity13 for $ 500 million ( £ 295 million ) , and the satellite firm has hinted its technology could potentially be used to predict when @entity17 's next @entity16 will launch			1
it said an increase of trucks around the building may suggest the phone is being shipped @entity29 - 1 , which was launched in november , captured up to 90 - second video clips at 30 frames per second			1
satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			2
@entity36 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
the circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb			0
the @entity45 group , @entity44 , is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the @entity49			1
@entity50 , an identical version of @entity29 - 1 , is scheduled to launch in 2014			0
according to a report by @entity53 in @entity54 , an analyst at @entity56 found out that if he looked at satellite images of parking areas of @entity59 , he could predict the company 's sales figures			2
@entity13 hopes to achieve a similar result using far more powerful data			2
‘ we think we are going to fundamentally change humanity 's understanding of the economic landscape on a daily basis , ’ co-founder @entity64 told @entity53			0
@entity64 added the firm is measuring the amount of trucks outside the tawainese - electronics group @entity21 , for example , to find out when the next @entity16 will be released			1
however , the firm did not reveal its predictions for this date			0
@entity78 - company @entity13 can also determine how much oil is being pumped out of the ground in @entity81 by using satellites to monitor overground storage tanks			1
by 2016 , the @entity78 company will be able to take full images of the @entity49 twice a day , at a resolution that was , until recently , illegal to use for commercial purposes			1
satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			2
@entity36 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
shown here is a view of @entity95 this image is a screen grab from a video created by @entity100 site nowhereelse.fr			2
it features an industrial model of the @entity16 handset , believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design			0
satellite imagery could help reveal when it will be released by the time its fleet of 24 satellites launches in 2018 , @entity13 will be able to image the entire @entity49 at a resolution capable of capturing real - time video of vehicles			1
@entity13 has already hit the headlines for capturing the first hd video footage of @entity49 from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as being ' like live @entity4 maps			1
' satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity36 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
the firm says it has produced similar performance in a box 20 times smaller			0
this video grab , taken by @entity13 , reveals high - resolution views of @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 ( pictured ) a mine in @entity135 captured using the @entity13 satellite			1
led by aerospace industry veteran @entity137 , @entity13 has been working on additional satellites that should be easier to complete with @entity4 's backing ' the circuitry that drives our satellites - providing power , attitude control , communications , thermal management , and imaging support - are about the size of a phone book and consume less power than a 100w light bulb , ' it says			1
' we 've integrated the latest , greatest , and fastest commercially available @entity152 , processors , and memory to ensure our small satellites pack the largest possible punch			0

' the time is right to join a company who can challenge us to think even bigger and bolder , and who can support us in accelerating our ambitious vision , ' @entity13 said in a blog post			2
@entity50 , an identical version of @entity29 - 1 , is scheduled to launch in early 2014			0

@entity13 said it is monitoring @entity22 electronics firm @entity21 's offices
satellites monitor its trucks to find out when next @entity16 will be released
@entity4 recently acquired satellite group @entity13 for $ 500 million
by 2016 , the groups will be able to take hd images of @entity49 twice a day
by 2018 , @entity13 will be able to image the entire @entity49 at a resolution to capture real - time video of vehicles
