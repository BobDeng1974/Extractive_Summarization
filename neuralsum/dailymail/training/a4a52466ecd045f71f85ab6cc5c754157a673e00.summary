for many @entity2 students , going to the pub is as much a part of university life as going to lectures			1
but conscientious @entity7 staff are encouraging foreign students not to indulge in that particular aspect of local culture and have prepared a £ 3,000 video warning of the perils of binge - drinking			1
the video , commissioned by the @entity15 , will tell new international students that ' there might be rules and traditions , but you do n't need to join in			1
' it comes less than five months after photographs of @entity24 students stripping off , vomiting and urinating in flower beds prompted concerns about drinking rituals enjoyed by undergraduates			1
' but it 's important to remember that playing hard does n't necessarily mean drinking hard			1
' of course you 're going to want to relax and let off some steam			0
but drinking too much can easily make a great night turn sour			0
' the boozy ' rules and traditions ' to which the presenters refer may include the annual @entity46 sunday event			1
more than 2,000 students descended on a public park for this year 's event in may			2
time at the bar : a scene from the video , which advises international students that they ' do n't need to join in ' some of the boozy rituals and traditions at @entity7 the student presenters offer plenty of sensible advice to the would - be students common sense : @entity2 students would be well advised to follow the video 's suggestions parents with young children looked on appalled as girls downed port from condoms and acted out sexual positions with male students			1
many of the students , both male and female , could barely stand by the end of the afternoon			2
the four - minute video for international students , which has also been posted on @entity77 , includes contributions from police , @entity81 staff , and city clubs and pubs			1
dr @entity84 , of @entity85 in @entity24 , says : ' it 's a big problem for us			0
about 40 per cent of the people we see arriving after midnight at this hospital are attending because of alcohol bingeing			0
' dr @entity84 continues : ' we get people turning up not sure whether they had sexual intercourse last night because they were drunk			0
stocked up : students bring trolley full of alcohol into a public park during the @entity46 sunday drinking event ritual : students wearing hard hats swig from bottles during the @entity106 sunday event on @entity107 , @entity24 , in may this year rude tradition : girls downed port from condoms and acted out sexual positions with fellow @entity7 students in may ' we saw somebody who fell over about three weeks before finals			2
they broke their wrist , they broke their right hand , they could n't write			2
' in addition to raising concerns about drinking , the video also warns foreign students that wearing their college gowns out could make them an ' easy target '			0
the presenters say : ' ditch the gown and the tux before you head out on the town			0
' that way you wo n't stand out as such an easy target later in the night			0
' and if you 're still feeling threatened , head to any porter 's lodge			0
' @entity141 , domus bursar at @entity143 , said : ' the @entity77 link makes it easy to get the message to new students before @entity148 ' week and they are far more likely to listen to this advice from fellow students rather than the college authorities			1
' lessons to learn : the video also warns foreign students at @entity7 ( pictured ) that wearing their college gowns out could make them an ' easy target '			0

four - minute @entity77 film will be shown to international students
it cost £ 3,000 and includes contributions from police and @entity81 staff
' there might be rules and traditions , but you do n't need to join in , ' it says
