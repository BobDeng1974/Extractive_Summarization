emergency services have been left red faced after being led on a wild goose chase following two hoax distress calls , about a plane that had crashed because of faulty landing gear			1
it 's believed a man , called up the @entity8 air traffic control centre just before noon on monday and pretended he was a pilot before proceeding to tell operators there were problems with his equipment on board			1
the @entity14 reported the man 's voice was slow and slurred in the recording of communication obtained by @entity19			0
the controller was heard trying to keep the unknown man calm , before advising him to try to land at the @entity23 where emergency personnel would be waiting			2
a man called the @entity8 air traffic control centre ( pictured ) pretending to be a pilot claimed he was about to crash because of faulty landing gear			1
after hours of searching for the plane emergency services discovered the call was a hoax the distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services , to locate the supposed plane or wreckage , including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines , including a @entity40 airlines plane ( pictured ) to look out for any sign of the aircraft but the recording suddenly got heated with the man claiming he had a warning in his engine			1
i 've got a fire warning , it 's getting difficult to fly , ' said the man			0
' we 're gone , tell them i love them , we 're gone			0
' the distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services , to locate the supposed plane or wreckage , including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines to look out for any sign of the aircraft			2
the @entity60 have said they passed the information onto the @entity63 police to investigate after hours of searching for the apparent plane and wreckage , nothing was found			2
but controllers did however get another strange call , this time from a pilot flying another plane named ' @entity70 ' according to the @entity14			0
it 's believed the man , who tried to change his identity , was in fact the same man who made the first call and proceeded to tell operators that he was searching for the wreckage of the plane			1
' we have got contact of interest , a boat , and are watching it very closely , ' he said			0
but by this time authorities were ignoring the call , aware that it was in fact another hoax call			0
it 's believed the @entity60 have passed information onto the @entity63 police to investigate			1
last month @entity63 police issued a media release saying that the @entity63 emergency services often receive hoax calls or prank calls			1
they said the valuable time spent attending the calls places a huge drain on resources			0
the release also said ' while @entity99 are attending your prank call , somewhere someone else could be losing the valuable time they need to get assistance			0
' it reminds people that hoax calls to emergency services is an offence .			2
