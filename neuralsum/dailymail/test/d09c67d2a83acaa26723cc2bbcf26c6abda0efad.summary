they take singing very seriously in the @entity1			1
in 2007 , a 29 - year - old karaoke performer was shot dead at a bar in @entity4 for delivering an off - key rendition of my way			2
there followed a spate of copycat killings provoked by inadequate attempts at the song			0
the death toll now as high as 12 , many clubs have taken my way off their playlist			0
he already has two platinum albums to his name back home			0
and that ’s the thing ; in a country where the line ‘ and now the end is near ’ can have literal truth if delivered out of tune , @entity16 ’s voice really is n’t particularly special			1
his jokes are n’t always zingers , either , but that has n’t stopped him having his own sitcom , @entity31 , plus a game show , @entity33 on the @entity34			0
@entity16 recorded his own song for when he takes to the ring for his fight with @entity38 this screenshot shows @entity16 playing it for laughs in his sitcom @entity31 @entity16 also has a quiz show called @entity33 he is being pursued for £ 33m in unpaid taxes but remains a twice - elected and popular congressman and if he ran for president would win by a landslide			1
he is just over 5ft 6in but doubles as the player - coach of a professional basketball team , the @entity50			1
his birthday is celebrated like a national holiday , and there is a truce in the civil war to the south of the country whenever he fights			1
each april , in @entity61 , the battle of @entity60 is re-enacted , when @entity1 warrior @entity62 repelled the conquistador forces of @entity65			1
in previous years , the role of @entity67 has been played by @entity16 ; as this year he was in training to fight @entity38 , they merely dedicated the performance to him instead			1
there is no point comparing @entity16 with sporting contemporaries because there is no - one like him			1
@entity76 , at his peak , moved @entity77			0
if he won a tournament on the sunday , the markets were more confident and buoyant the following morning			0
to influence the biggest economy in the free world is beyond @entity16 , true			1
yet what does it say of @entity76 ? that he was corporate @entity84 ’s poster boy			0
drive five minutes from the azalea - skirted fairways of @entity86 and it is possible to find whole communities entirely untouched by the @entity76 phenomenon , no matter the racial boundaries broken			2
@entity16 , in his own land , is different			1
@entity16 is the people ’s champion			1
whatever the state of his accounts , he still pays 64 per cent more tax than any other citizen in the @entity1			1
he builds hospitals , his wealth fights natural disasters			0
the crime rate plummets when he fights , his country stops , roads clear			0
may 3 – the date of the @entity38 bout in @entity16 ’s homeland – has already been declared a national holiday , and there , the world ’s richest fight can be viewed free			1
no pay - per - view in @entity110			2
temporary paper billboards will be erected on street corners , plazas and in church grounds , so that crowds can watch the action direct from @entity117			1
the judges ’ scores will be shown via @entity120			0
no other sportsman would command this level of attention in one country ; @entity16 ’s fame has transcended the boxing ring			1
@entity16 's fan rally was another moment for the small screen as the ring legend took a selfie at the event size does n't seem to matter when @entity16 takes to the basketball court - well , it 's his team as a pious @entity138 – his bible is never far from his side , its most affecting passages highlighted in pink – he would not welcome the allusion , but the devotion he inspires is that of a pontiff			1
it is papal , the love that follows him in the @entity1 ; his people would chair him through the streets if they could			1
on a more earthbound level , he is @entity150 , @entity151 or pre-ignominy @entity152 , a star beyond familiar experience			0
@entity38 is a boxer ; a great boxer , a very wealthy boxer , but a boxer , still			2
@entity16 , while being the underdog in pure sporting terms on saturday , is somehow more			1
he has been elevated to higher ground			0
at the @entity159 of the @entity161 hotel in @entity117 , the @entity162 of @entity117 ( @entity163 2001 ) is on its third number			2
corralled behind steel barriers , a crowd – bemused , impatient – are waiting to see one man			0
instead , they are being treated to a second - rate talent show			2
@entity1 singers replace the @entity162 dancers and two unfunny @entity174 ’s try desperately to drum up frenzy			2
' he ’s in the building , ' they scream which , as @entity16 actually checked into the resort on monday , is hardly an earth - shattering development			1
when he arrives , the contrast between the hype and the human is immediate , the sincerity of the figure in the white tee and camel coloured trousers smiling sweetly at the crowd , quite obvious			0
they wave back : national flags and home - made banners			2
one shows a hungry pac - man eating a dollar sign			2
later , in the @entity196 – strangely appropriate , pandas are bears yet are seen as benign , cuddly creatures – @entity16 ’s effect on those of @entity1 descent is clear			1
the @entity203 dancers file in and crowd the aisles			0
every time @entity16 speaks they giggle like smitten schoolgirls			2
an endless string of selfies are taken , until they begin teasing each other about their faux - teenage crushes			0
one of the dancers is given a souvenir boxing glove by a pressman			0
nothing unique , just a memento that could be bought at any local sports shop or in the foyer of the hotel , a commemorative glove with the fight ’s logo and date embossed on the mitt , yet she stares at it as if presented with a holy relic until broken from her reverie by the sound of more squeals as another image is committed to digital memory ; laughing girls in the foreground , @entity16 a smudge in the distance			1
but , still , that ’s him			0
@entity16 addressed his fans , the ones in @entity117 anyway , at the @entity238 on tuesday @entity1 dancers were part of the entertainment during the fan rally for @entity16 @entity16 mania was in full swing with just a few days to go before he enters the ring in @entity117 @entity38 had dancers of his own for his arrival at the @entity249 just along the famous @entity117 it is fair to say there are few middle - class boxers but even by the standards of a working man ’s sport , @entity16 ’s story is exceptional			1
@entity38 grew up poor , but it was first - world poor ; the electricity might have been cut off , and his family sometimes slept seven to a room , but there were safety nets , checks and balances			1
there was always a roof and no - one went hungry			0
@entity16 is a third - world survivor			1
he was born in @entity269 , 600 miles south of the capital @entity110 , a part of the region now consumed by terrorism			0
@entity16 knew tin - shanty poverty , hungry - every - day poverty , bare - foot poverty ; he knew what it was to be filthy poor , unable to bathe , dirty , unschooled			1
his father abandoned the family when @entity16 was small , came home unannounced one day , killed , cooked and ate his dog , and then left again			1
when @entity16 departed for the capital it was n’t out of up - by - the - bootstraps ambition , but basic human necessity			1
his family could n’t feed him ; but maybe he could feed himself			0
he slept rough , he sold doughnuts for loose change and fought in the back streets for little more – sometimes the purse was the equivalent of £ 1			0
the iconic black and white images that have since emerged of @entity16 at his @entity110 gym at the age of 17 were taken three years after he arrived in the capital , and 10 fights into his professional career			2
even then , he looks scrawny , raw , unpolished – a street kid as much as a street fighter			0
it is hard to reconcile those haunted eyes with the figure who will march confidently towards the ring at the @entity249 on saturday , to the sound of his own voice			0
these images of a 17 - year - old @entity16 training in @entity110 were published ahead of the big fight @entity16 left his home as a 14 - year - old and headed for @entity110 , the capital of the @entity1 @entity16 turned professional aged 16 and had 10 fights by the time these images were taken @entity16 , as befits a platinum - selling game show host , basketball player turned singer - politician and world welterweight champion , has brought out a song for this fight called @entity323 , which translates as ‘ i will fight for the @entity1 ’			1
' even if i am in pain , ' @entity16 sings , ' i force myself to hide it and be silent			1
my heart is bleeding yet others do n’t see it , but what is important is that my country is happy			0
i will fight around the world , i will risk my life			0
i am @entity1 , we are @entity1			2
' the video is at the botom of the page			0
and yet , in its way , it is him			0
just as @entity342 tried his whole life to erase the association of his home town , @entity346 , with unimaginable tragedy , so @entity16 ’s mission is to reawaken feelings of pride in a nation whose global image has been defined by a corrupt political dynasty and a president ’s wife , obsessed with shoes			2
at the time @entity16 was barefoot on the streets of @entity269 , @entity357 was hoarding 3,000 pairs of the finest designer heels			2
it is this perception that he , @entity363 – @entity364 – feels it is his duty to address			0
that is why he sings , that is why he stands , that is why he prays and , most significantly , that is why he fights .			0

@entity16 and @entity38 fight in @entity117 on saturday
the day of the bout is a national holiday in the @entity1
@entity16 ca n't be compared with other sports stars - there 's none like him
he has tv shows , plays , coaches basketball and sings
@entity16 is a twice - elected and popular congressman in his homeland
saturday 's fight will be worth at least *$* 300m
