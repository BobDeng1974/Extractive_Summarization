by @entity0 from concentration camps to starvation and public executions , life inside @entity2 is often thought of as a harsh and brutal existence			1
but as this set of pictures shows , the closed off country can also be picturesque and even beautiful despite the dictatorial regime of leader @entity11			1
the images were taken by @entity14 photographer @entity13 , who spent two weeks travelling around the one - party state last month			1
welcome to @entity2 : photographer @entity13 has captured the softer side of the isolated nation , including air hostesses from state - owned @entity20 that met him before his flight in just married : this newlywed couple couple are photographed sitting on the grass near a fountain in @entity25 , @entity2 , just after their big day the picture project captured the softer side of @entity2 , including this couple heading to get married in the capital @entity25 ( left ) and these family pictures hanging on the wall of a house in @entity33 in the country 's north among the snaps were idyllic - looking shots of farmland and countryside taken as @entity13 passed above it in a plane while on his travels the series includes shots of flight attendants from @entity20 , @entity2 's national airline , young women relaxing in the @entity47 , and a marriage ceremony with the bride in an ornate pink gown			1
the trip included a chartered plane flight to the north of the country , allowing @entity13 to capture aerial images showcasing the country 's natural beauty			2
but while these pictures may appear to show a softer side to the country , the @entity59 - based photographer is well aware that he was shielded from the true harshness of life under the regime			2
despite the tranquil experience , @entity13 said the journey left him convinced that @entity2 is actually worse than most people think because they are hiding so much @entity13 said that , while he was allowed to take more pictures than he originally thought , his travel was extremely restricted and carried out to a set itinerary big news : @entity11 covered the front pages state - owned newspaper @entity73 after winning an election in which every single vote went to him one for the photo album : while @entity13 said he was amazed at first at what normal lives the @entity2 were living , he quickly realised it was all a show @entity14 photographer @entity13 said he did n't believe any of the stories the tour guides told him , and noticed that fake buildings had been set up to trick him ( pictured , jets on a runway in @entity33 ) @entity13 said : ' i was there two weeks , so i went from feeling like going to a zoo - looking at the people and being amazed they have normal lives and go to work - to reaching a point where i would n't believe guide 's stories about simple things like the number of lakes			1
' with the stories , itineraries and fake buildings - built to justify the stories - the only thing you can rely on is just the book you read about the country			0
' there is so much which is hidden for foreigners that i actually think the situation is worse that i thought			2
when you hide that much there must be a lot to hide			0
' when you look at the standard itinerary you have to choose it is very very boring : statues , cooperative farms and museums			0
so the interest is the different layers from what you see to the political and stories you read the country			0
at first @entity13 was amazed to see people living normal lives - such as these women in a ' youth park ' in @entity25 - but he quickly realised he was being deceived as well as tranquil countryside @entity13 was allowed to photograph some of the more gritty , urban landscape around the capital @entity25 mist hangs low over blocks of apartment buildings in this shot @entity13 took in the @entity2 capital of @entity25 while being given a guided tour of the country ad fad : there are no adverts in @entity2 , instead billboards are covered with propaganda posters such as this one urging people to work harder for their country not the @entity149 : this building could almost be mistaken for the @entity149 in @entity151 , but it is in fact the @entity154 in @entity25 , @entity2 ' traveling around @entity2 is like if @entity155 was still on earth			1
you go to a place and there is a list of times the leaders have visited , including a small museum with the chair he was sitting on			0
' the @entity2 describes itself as a socialist state but it is widely viewed by the international community as a totalitarian dictatorship , with an elaborate cult of personality operating around the ruling @entity11 family			2
although elections are held every five years , supreme leader @entity11 was elected to the highest legislative body in march without receiving a single vote against him - and with no - one else on the ballot			0
@entity13 was required to travel around the country with the mandatory two guides and a driver - and the occasional government official checking up on them			1
get to work : commuters in @entity25 wait in a long line in order to catch the bus to and from work in the city centre on the country 's poor public transport system on the move : a female train guard waits for a train on @entity2 's metro system in front of a mural painted on the far wall hard at work : the regime in @entity25 have previously banned photographers for taking images of people relaxing , but are keen to promote snaps of people at work to promote the country working hard or hardly working ? a woman in @entity208 's fertiliser factory answers a telephone ( left ) while yellow smoke billows from the factory chimney ( right ) he added : ' i was there to take photos but also to try to understand the different lives people have under different regimes and political situations			1
' most people foreigners meet are used to having their pictures taken and are somehow okay with it			0
' it is difficult to get in contact with other people so when you do it is mostly how you approach them			0
with a smile they seem to be interested in communicating with foreigners but guides will often try to stop any contact			0
' i was often told not to take photos but talking nicely to the guides and sometimes pushing them a bit i was allowed to take more photos than i expected			0
' i was allowed to go on several walks , both in @entity25 and other cities in @entity2			2
' isolated : @entity13 said that with a smile most people in the sparsely populated country are willing to talk , but guides will often stop them from speaking glorious leader : this square in @entity25 is named after the founder of the @entity11 dynasty , @entity247 , which was inherited by @entity250 before being passed to @entity11 seen from above : while @entity13 's photography was restricted while he was on the ground , in the air he was able to capture shots from the window of his plane guarded : @entity13 said he was forced to travel around the country with two guides and a driver - and the occasional government official keeping tabs on where he was			1

@entity13 travelled around @entity2 *accompanied* by two guides , a driver and government officials
was amazed at how normal peoples ' lives in the secretive communist state seemed *compared* to his own
however he soon realised the regime were deceiving him into believing all was well under dictatorial rule
said he left feeling regime was worse than he thought because the guides hid so much of the country from him
