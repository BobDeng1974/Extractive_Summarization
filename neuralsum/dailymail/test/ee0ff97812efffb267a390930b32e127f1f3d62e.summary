@entity0 recorded his first ever hole - in - one at the masters on wednesday , as @entity3 fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par - three contest			1
@entity8 holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside @entity10 on five under par , only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play - off hole			1
@entity10 holds his trophy aloft after winning the @entity16 on a play - off against @entity3 @entity10 therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the ' curse ' of the par - three champion , with no player ever becoming par - three and @entity2 champion in the same year			1
however , that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11 - year - old caddie @entity25 , who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour			0
@entity10 found @entity25 via the @entity27 and invited him to be his caddie in the light - hearted curtain - raiser			2
@entity31 's par - three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major ' it was a really fun day , especially to have @entity25 with me here , ' @entity10 said			1
' this is n't about me today			0
it 's about helping him out and showing him a great day			0
' @entity8 said : ' i 've made a few hole - in - ones , but it 's pretty special to make them here			1
the second one , we were a little more emotional there			0
we just kind of jumped			0
' @entity0 had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth , his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole			2
woods played in the masters par - three contest at @entity31 for the first time in 11 years that took the 75 - year - old six - time champion to three under par , but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph			1
former @entity62 champion @entity61 reminded @entity0 of the tradition that players who make a hole - in - one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when @entity0 walked past the @entity69 commentary position			1
' send me a bill , ' @entity0 replied			2
the @entity2 official @entity73 account shared an image of @entity75 and @entity76 with @entity77 the 18 - time major winner added on @entity69 : ' i never had a hole in one at @entity31 , in the par three ( contest ) or on the golf course			1
doing an interview this morning i said all i have to do is go out there , make a hole - in - one and win the par three			1
i had it three under and then choked			0
' since the contest started in 1960 , nobody has ever become par - three and @entity2 champion in the same week , a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible			1
most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies , including @entity76 this year for the first time since 2004			1
woods had his children @entity100 and @entity102 on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter @entity102 to tap in for par on the sixth			0
@entity0 ( centre ) with @entity109 ( left ) and @entity110 ( right ) during the @entity16 ' we had an absolutely great time			2
these were memories for a lifetime , ' said @entity76 , who was also accompanied by girlfriend @entity115			2
he later added on @entity73 : ' i 'll always have memories of my pop at @entity31 and now @entity100			2
' tournament favourite @entity75 had @entity120 singer @entity77 acting as his caddie and @entity77 proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water			0
' i apologise to golf , ' @entity77 joked			0
' i do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today ! there was a lot of pressure			0
' @entity75 , who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first @entity2 title on sunday , added : ' i wanted to do this because it 's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood			0
to spend a couple of hours like this was fun			0
