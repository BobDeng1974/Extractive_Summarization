by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 13:07 est , 28 august 2012 it sounds like a job for @entity3 the @entity5 cat - or maybe not			2
just two days after reports of a lion on the loose in @entity11 , commuters at one @entity8 station have been warned about a gang of rampaging mice which have apparently been ' attacking ' their feet as they wait for trains			1
the problem has got so bad that a message appeared on a whiteboard at @entity19 yesterday urging passengers to ' tuck the bottom of their trousers into their socks '			0
the sign , handwritten on a whiteboard in black pen , informed passengers of the ' attacks ' and said they should ' avoid being a victim '			1
warning : @entity31 says the sign was not written by any of its staff and it 's believed to be a joke by a member of the public urging passengers to ' avoid being a victim ' it comes as @entity40 's cat @entity3 caught his first ever rodent today - more than a year after the five - year - old moggie was brought into help curb the mouse problem at @entity45			2
the reluctant mouser was finally spotted playing with the dead mouse this morning before he proudly dumped its body on the grass			0
however , the problem at @entity19 could be too big a challenge for @entity3 , who , like his owner , is known to enjoy long periods of time ' chill - axing ' instead of stalking the corridors of power for vermin			0
amusing : mystery surrounds who is responsible for the sign which has been seen by thousands of people on @entity63 today this afternoon @entity31 , which is in charge of the station , denied any of its staff wrote the note			1
a spokesman said : ' it was n't a @entity31 message , it 's been removed and we do n't believe it was written by a member of @entity31 staff			0
' we are not aware of any mice at the station			0
' the spokesman said the sign was removed overnight			2
no worries : @entity31 said it was not aware of any problems with mice at @entity19 ( pictured ) however , it still raised a few eyebrows among passengers who spotted the sign and posted pictures of it on @entity63			1
it has now been viewed by thousands of people			1
twitter user @ alfredcamp wrote : ' first the # @entity89 brought fear , then the # @entity91 wreaked havoc , but now a new terror has been unleashed ! ' meanwhile , @ @entity94 said : ' i am not passing through @entity19 without a packet of mini cheddars as mouse bait @entity98 ' another @entity63 user said : ' hey , it would be worse			1
there could be a lion on the loose			0

the sign has been seen by thousands of commuters and people on @entity63
