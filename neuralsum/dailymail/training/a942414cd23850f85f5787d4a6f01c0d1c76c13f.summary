@entity1 boss @entity0 is relishing another tilt at major @entity4 opposition when the new @entity5 kicks off on friday night			1
the 20 - team tournament , formed earlier this year following months of wrangling and often bitter argument , replaces the @entity9 as @entity11 club rugby prepares for its 20th successive season			1
and @entity1 will get the ball rolling , hosting 2013 @entity4 champions and 2014 runners - up @entity15 at @entity17			1
@entity1 director of rugby @entity0 during the @entity18 at @entity17 although @entity1 are currently outside the @entity20 's top half , @entity15 only have two teams below them in the @entity23 and are 16 points behind leaders @entity25 after losing six of their opening nine league games			1
but @entity0 said : ' it 's pretty frightening			1
they might have had an inconsistent start to the season , but they are a brilliant side			2
' they are @entity23 champions and finalists over the past two years , so what a massive game to start it off			2
it 's going to be ferocious			0
' the game will be decided by the little things that happen within the match			0
if they go our way , we will win and everyone will say we 're great , and if they do n't , we will lose and everyone will say we 're terrible and @entity15 are great			2
@entity1 prop @entity51 has not had the easiest start to life as club captain this season ' that 's how tight this is			1
top - level sport is about margins , and if you work hard enough the margins go your way			0
' we have n't been consistent at the start of the season , but we will hit form and , when we do , we can match anybody			0
' we always like playing the @entity4 sides because they play rugby , they try and attack			2
' people have this turgid view of the @entity23 , but they do n't ( play like that ) , especially @entity15			2
we 've played them a few times in pre-season over the years and we know the threats they have			0
this will be a great challenge for us			0
' @entity79 of @entity1 looks on in the rain against @entity81 on friday night @entity0 has made three changes to the side beaten by @entity81 last friday , with centre @entity84 replacing @entity86 , scrum - half @entity87 returning after his partner gave birth to the couple 's first child , and hooker @entity93 is in for @entity94			1
@entity15 , meanwhile , will be spearheaded by their outstanding half - back combination of skipper @entity96 and @entity97 , with @entity100 internationals @entity98 and @entity101 also in the starting line - up			1
' there will be a lot attention on the game and it 's going to be exciting for everyone at the club , ' @entity0 added			1
' it 's a great tournament			0
now that it is here and back again , everyone 's delighted			0
@entity112 of @entity1 wins line - out ball during last weekend 's defeat at @entity115 ' it is a massive emotional rollercoaster and you have to be very level the whole way through , but it does n't get much tougher to start with			1
' elsewhere , the second - tier @entity120 continues on friday night with @entity121 hosting @entity122 and @entity123 visiting in - form @entity124			0
@entity121 show 14 changes following their league win against @entity127 last weekend , with full - back @entity128 , centres @entity130 and @entity131 and wing @entity132 all making their first starts of the season , while there are opportunities up - front for lock @entity138 and flanker @entity139 .			0
