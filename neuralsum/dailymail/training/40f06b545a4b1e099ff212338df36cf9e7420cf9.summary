by @entity0 @entity1 , 91 , who risked his life on the beaches at @entity4 , has been told he can get into the 70th anniversary event for free after initially being asked to fork out £ 27.50 a war museum who denied a d - day veteran free entry to an event marking the 70th anniversary of the invasion have finally agreed to waive his fee			1
but @entity1 , 91 , said the offer has come too late and maintains he is still not going to the event			1
as part of the @entity17 ’s @entity16 , mr @entity1 helped ferry troops to the @entity4 beaches on june 6 1944 , when more than 5,000 @entity21 troops were killed			1

now staff at the venue reversed their decision after hearing ' feedback			2
' hearing the museum had changed their mind , mr @entity1 said : '' that is very nice of them , but that was n't the purpose of the exercise			1
' they should have invited the veterans to the event and offered tickets at a concession price to us			2
' that would have been a much better approach			0
' they have n't given me enough notice and my daughter ca n't drive me there that day so i wo n't be going			0
' mr. @entity1 , a great - grandfather - of - 13 from @entity54 , said he was annoyed he can only get a seniors concession when under - 15s are allowed in for free			1
before the offer , he said : ' we were there on d - day but we ca n’t even get a discount			0

' widow @entity80 , from @entity81 , @entity82 , whose d - day veteran husband @entity83 died last year , said : ' i think the veterans should get some sort of concession			2
' they did a lot for this country and i think they deserve it			0
' the event will feature an air show of wartime planes			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity23 , @entity24 , said : ' we have listened to feedback and now realise that on this special occasion it is more appropriate to make an exception for our d - day veterans , and we would be delighted to welcome them at @entity24 this weekend without charge			0
