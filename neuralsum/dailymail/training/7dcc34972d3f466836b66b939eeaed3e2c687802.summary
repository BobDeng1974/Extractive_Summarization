the lyricist said that he could have made more than £ 1million from offers to put turbines on his @entity10 estate , but believes green energy schemes are a ‘ scam ’			1
sir @entity1 , 68 , who was once a high profile support of the @entity14 , said its wind - farm policy has made him unsure how he will vote			1
‘ wind farms are one of the most dishonest scams perpetuated by any organisation ever , ’ he told @entity17			0
sir @entity1 ( left ) has admitted he is unsure if he will vote for the @entity2 in the future due to prime minister @entity4 's wind - farm policy ‘ they do n’t work , are hideous to look at , destroy birds and bats , are bad for people ’s health and put up people ’s bills			1
he added : ‘ we have some land in @entity10 and we were asked to put wind turbines on it			2
i could have made £ 1million or more out of it with all the grants and so forth - it is an absolute racket			1
’ the @entity39 is currently signed up to a legally binding @entity41 renewable energy target requiring it to produce about 15 per of its energy from renewable sources by 2020			0
sir @entity1 ’s criticism came as a @entity47 bishop said no more wind farms should be allowed in the countryside as they are a ‘ blot ’ on ‘ @entity52 ’s creation ’			1
scam : sir @entity1 reveals he could have made £ 1 million from wind turbines on his land in @entity10 , but has dismissed the renewable energy initiative as an ' absolute racket ' @entity59 the right reverend @entity58 said he has a @entity61 duty to protect the beautiful landscapes in his diocese from ‘ becoming marred and disfigured ’			1
breaking ranks with an unofficial consensus within the @entity47 strongly favouring wind energy , the 69 - year - old said there are ‘ critical questions ’ about if turbines will even reduce carbon emissions			1
in a letter to a local newspaper , the bishop said that having spent time touring his diocese , which included @entity76 , he had been unable not to notice the growing number of wind farms			0
‘ it is a basic @entity61 truth that we all have a duty and a responsibility to care for and exercise wise stewardship over @entity52 ’s creation , which has been entrusted to us , ’ he wrote			0
fan : prime minister @entity4 put his money where his mouth is by having a wind turbine erected at his @entity90 home in 2007 ‘ our countryside needs to be protected and preserved for ourselves , for our children and for our grandchildren as a place of refreshment and renewal for the spiritual health and wellbeing of us all			0
‘ the danger is that in parts of @entity76 , our landscape is becoming marred and disfigured and turned into one industrial site after another			0

‘ is now not the time to say “ enough ” to any further blots on our landscape ? please remember above all that “ the earth is the lord ’s , and all that fills it ” @entity122 24			0
’ he added : ‘ whilst we all recognise the need for a greater reliance on sources of renewable energy , there are critical questions to be asked not only about the efficiency of wind turbines in general but also about the massive environmental impact that the significant growth and cumulative effect that wind farms are having in @entity76			2
‘ there is no evidence that i have seen that suggests that wind farms will ever provide the reliable , controllable energy that is required by our society , however many there might be			2
‘ furthermore some studies have even suggested that far from reducing co2 emissions , wind farms actually increase them			0
’ sir @entity1 , who co-wrote @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 with @entity151 , owns the 33,000 - acre @entity153 estate in @entity154 on the west coast of @entity10			1
