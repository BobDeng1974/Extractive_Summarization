by @entity0 @entity2 fans might doubt whether @entity3 will have much of an impact on the coming @entity5			1
but the @entity7 centre - forward has made a habit over recent years - at international level at least - of proving his critics wrong			1
when @entity12 ’s @entity11 was declared fit to make the final 23 man squad it seemed likely that @entity3 , who is also now set to be replaced by @entity11 at club level , would miss out on @entity16			1
the now 30 year old was however included – and now travels to try and win his fourth consecutive international tournament			0
point to prove : @entity3 ( centre ) goes into this @entity5 with question marks about his form fancy footwork : @entity3 ( centre ) tries to spectacularly flick the ball away from @entity26 team - mate @entity24 ( left ) practice makes perfect : @entity3 shoots at goal during a break in training with @entity7 this week that is quite some record - especially considering that for many supporters in @entity34 has long been a busted flush			1
serious thigh and knee injuries meant he was already on the decline at @entity40 before his move to @entity2 in january 2010			2
since then eight @entity43 managers have tried - and failed - to spark a return to the form which persuaded @entity46 to pay the huge 50 million fee			2
@entity7 coach @entity48 has been more patient than most but even he had lost faith by february 2012			0
@entity50 - who had gone 20 @entity2 games without a goal - was then dropped for @entity7 ’s final friendly before the squad was named for that summer ’s @entity55 finals in @entity56 and @entity57			1
a few months later the situation had changed again			0
@entity48 ’s first choice @entity60 had not recovered from a broken leg			0
@entity3 had also scored at @entity63 ’s @entity62 on the way to winning that season ’s @entity65			1
so ‘ @entity3 ’ went to @entity56 and @entity57 , where he started just two games			0
but still scored four times and ended the tournament with both another winners ’ medal and the ‘ golden boot ’			2
lethal : @entity3 scores past @entity74 as @entity7 beat @entity75 4 - 0 to triumph @entity76 this time around the story looks pretty similar			1
@entity3 has not had a good campaign at club level , with current @entity81 boss @entity80 clearly not a fan			0
and the now 30 year old was not picked in any international squad during the 2013/14 season , with @entity11 , @entity85 , @entity86 and last summer ’s big @entity87 signing @entity88 all rated better by @entity48			2
that was until fate again intervened - @entity11 was hamstrung , @entity86 and @entity88 woefully off - form , and @entity85 not seen as a fit with @entity7 ’s tiki - taka style			1
leading the way : @entity11 is expected to start up front for @entity7 during the @entity5 look away now : @entity3 ( right ) has struggled for form and goals this season with @entity2 so @entity3 returned for last friday ’s warm - up friendly against @entity98 in @entity99 , where he snatched at a number of presentable goal chances , but also converted a penalty to move to 37 goals in 107 international caps			1
the following morning he was confirmed in @entity7 ’s squad for the tournament			0
it still seems most likely that @entity108 will be @entity7 ’s central attacker for their opener against @entity112 in @entity113 on june 13			0
@entity11 looks first choice should @entity48 opt for a traditional number nine later in the tournament			0
but given past experience nobody should bet against @entity50 making another mark at some point over the next six weeks .			0

thirty - year - old @entity2 *striker* has struggled for form this season
@entity3 faces *competition* from @entity11 to start for @entity7
proved critics wrong by winning golden boot at @entity76
