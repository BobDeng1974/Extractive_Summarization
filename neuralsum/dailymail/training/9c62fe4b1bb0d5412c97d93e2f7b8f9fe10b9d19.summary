by @entity0 published : 15:34 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 15:34 est , 30 may 2013 it may have been millions of years since our ancestors lived among the branches but it seems many of us still carry an unusual relic of our tree - dwelling days			1
new research shows that one in 13 humans walk around on chimp - like feet that feature the same adaptation as our tree - climbing cousins			2
researchers from @entity15 filmed the feet of 400 volunteers as they walked barefoot around the @entity18			1
most humans have stiff arches to help them walk but study found up to one in eight of us share a flexible mid-foot with primates that help them climb trees they found as many as eight per cent of people have mid-foot flexibility			1
these people also had a higher than average @entity29 and flatter feet			0
but the study authors are unsure whether feature has stayed with some humans over the generations or whether it is a modern phenomenon caused by shoes			0
early hominid footprints from 3.5million years ago have been shown to have the same flexibility			0
primates flexible feet bends both at the ball and halfway to the heel which helps them hold onto branches but it was believed that the so - called midtarsal break had disappeared as humans evolved and began walking on two legs			1
@entity47 and @entity48 , writing in the @entity50 , that most people had no idea their feet were any difference , even though it was obvious to the naked eye			0
@entity47 told the new scientist : ' i was , and continue to be , surprised by this			0
' the study found that people with the midtarsal break had significantly flatter feet than average			2
primates , such as chimpanzees , have a more flexible mid-foot that is useful for climbing trees and bends both at the ball and half way to the heel			1
humans have a rigid mid-foot - between the ball and heel - that acts as a lever for walking			1
@entity79 believes that the same flexibility can be shown in the feet of most people and is actually a useful trait that adds stability when humans change speed			2
but @entity47 told the @entity56 that he thinks it is a hindrance to walking efficiently			0
he said : ' my guess is that we are getting more variation than ever before , perhaps because shoes have impacted foot anatomy .			0

researchers from @entity15 filmed 400 people walking barefoot
found eight per cent had unusual mid-foot flexibility - the same as primates
*design* helps primates climb trees but human arches are normally more rigid
