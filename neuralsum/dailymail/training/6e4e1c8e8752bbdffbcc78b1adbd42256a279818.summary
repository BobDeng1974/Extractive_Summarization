@entity0 have been mysteriously dying by the millions in recent months along the @entity2 west coast , worrying biologists who say the sea creatures are key to the marine ecosystem			0
scientists first started noticing the mass deaths in june 2013			1
different types of starfish , also known as sea stars , were affected , from wild ones along the coast to those in captivity , according to @entity15 , director of the @entity17 's @entity16			1
' the two species affected most are @entity19 ( purple sea star or ochre starfish ) and @entity23 ( sunflower sea star ) , ' he wrote in a statement in december			1
mystery : millions of starfish on the west coast are dying - and scientists have no idea why the sunflower sea star is considered among the largest starfish and can span more than a meter in diameter			1
the most commonly observed symptoms are white lesions on the arms of the sea star			0
the lesions spread rapidly , resulting in the loss of the arm			0
within days , the infection consumes the creature 's entire body , and it dies			2
entire populations have been wiped out in @entity45 off the coast of @entity47 , in the @entity48 off @entity50 's @entity49 as well as along the coast of @entity52			1
the mortality rate is estimated at 95 percent			0
scientists who have spent decades studying the local ecosystem have yet to identify the cause			2
' what we currently think is likely happening is that there is a pathogen , like a parasite or a virus or a bacteria , that is infecting the sea stars and that compromises in some way their immune system , ' @entity66 , chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology , at the @entity70 , @entity70 , told @entity73			0
wiped out : entire populations of starfish have been wiped out in @entity45 off the coast of @entity47 then , the creatures become more susceptible to bacteria which is " causing a secondary infection that causes most of the damages that you see			1
' a barometer of sea health the 2013 phenomenon has not been observed solely along the @entity84 ; a smaller outbreak also killed @entity87 sea stars last year			1
previous cases were believed to be associated with warmer waters -- sea stars have sensitive skin and prefer cooler water -- but this was not the case in 2013			2
and when the die - offs happened previously , the geographic span of the infections was much smaller , and far fewer sea stars were affected			2
in 1983 , an epidemic nearly wiped out the @entity19 from tidal pools along the southern coast of @entity52			0
another , smaller die - off in 1997 may have been caused by warmer waters in an @entity105 year , scientists said			0
parasite : scientists have theorized that there is some sort of parasite that is affecting the starfish 's immune system sea stars are important because ' they play a key role in this ecosystem on the @entity84 , ' @entity66 said			1
sea stars eat mussels , barnacles , snails , mollusks and other smaller sea life , so their health is considered a measure of marine life on the whole in a given area			0
when sea stars decline in number , ' the mussel population has the potential to dramatically increase , which could significantly alter the rocky intertidal zone , ' according to @entity15			0
while sea stars make up an important component of the base of the ocean food chain and are considered a top predator , they are in turn eaten by other starfish , shorebirds , gulls , and sometimes sea otters			0
in an effort to find out what is causing the mass deaths , scientists are collecting reports from the public , taking specimens to the lab for analysis and doing genetic sequencing to find out whether a toxin or an infection may be to blame .			1
