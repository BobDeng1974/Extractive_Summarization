@entity0 , 71 , has been diagnosed with breast cancer despite having had both her breasts removed in a double mastectomy nine years ago a pensioner has been diagnosed with breast cancer for a third time â€“ even though she has no breasts			1
@entity0 , 71 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , thought it was impossible for her to ever get breast cancer again after having both her breasts removed in a double mastectomy			1
however , nine years later she is once again facing a battle to survive , after what she believed was a skin rash turned out to be breast cancer			1
her doctors said the chances of cancer returning after a mastectomy were so rare they had never encountered or even heard of such a case			1
ms @entity0 now faces a lifetime of taking anti-cancer drugs to keep the tumour at bay			1
formerly a theatre worker , she said the high profile case of @entity26 had led people to believe that the operation was a fix - all solution			0
the actress had a double mastectomy in 2013 after finding out she had a gene linked to cancer			1
however , ms @entity0 said : ' i was totally convinced after having the mastectomy that i would not get breast cancer any more			1
' nobody had told me you could still get breast cancer after such a major operation			1
' i read in the newspaper that @entity26 had had a double mastectomy after finding out she had the cancer gene			1
' i wonder if she was aware that , although very rare , she could still get breast cancer ? ' doctors said while ms @entity0 's experience is ' unusual ' it is ' not unheard of '			1
during a double mastectomy , nearly all of the breast tissue is removed , but cancer can still return to the chest area			1
the more lymph nodes ( small masses of tissue that help the body fight infection and disease ) with cancer at the time of the mastectomy , the higher the chance the disease may return			2
breast cancer cells can also spread to other areas of the body through the lymph nodes and tumours could grow in places including the lungs , bones and skin			1
ms @entity0 was told she needed the drastic operation after suffering two breast cancer scares , the first in 1990 and then again 2002			1
she opted for a double mastectomy despite the fact that cancer was only present in one of her breasts because her grandmother had died of the disease			1
all was well for the next 10 years until she developed a worrying , lumpy rash over both of her breasts			2
actress @entity26 had a double mastectomy in 2013 after finding out she had a gene linked to cancer			1
she was told she had an 87 per cent chance of breast cancer due to the inherited gene			1
but ms @entity0 believes her case has led people to believe that the operation is a ' fix all solution ' she visited her gp who referred her to a dermatologist but was told she would have to wait three months for an appointment on the @entity98			2
ms @entity0 opted to go private and secured a consultation within a week - a decision she admits probably saved her life			2
' that 's probably why i 'm still here today , ' she said , ' the dermatologist who saw me said we should do a biopsy just in case it was anything more serious and that was what revealed the cancer			2
' she said she was ' absolutely terrified ' when the doctor told her she had breast cancer			1
while most people have no further problems , sometimes breast cancer can return			2
local recurrence if breast cancer comes back in the chest / breast area , or in the skin near the original site or the scar , this is called local recurrence			1
this means there are remaining cancer cells in the local area which have not been completely removed by the initial surgery or treatment			2
it is not the same as the cancer spreading			2
if this happens , patients usually need further surgery , but it is treatable			0
regional recurrence ( also called locally advanced ) breast cancer can also come back when it has spread beyond the breast and the lymph nodes under the arm into the tissues and lymph nodes around the chest , neck and under the breastbone			1
treatment for regional recurrence will depend on previous treatments , but could include surgery , radiotherapy and drug treatments			0
people who have a regional recurrence are thought to have an increased risk of cancer cells spreading to other areas of the body			2
treatments such as chemotherapy , hormone and targeted therapies are given because they are systemic treatments which work throughout the whole body			0
when breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body such as the bones , lungs , liver or brain , this is called secondary breast cancer			2
source : @entity168 ' first of all i was shocked - i could n't believe it			0
i was totally devastated , ' she added			0
' i had been so happy that day - it was my sister 's birthday and i 'd just bought a property , a beautiful garden flat , and i was so high on that			0
' i went into the surgery bouncing with joy and i sat down and the nurse asked me if i wanted my results			0
i said " yes , of course " , not thinking for a second that she was going to say those awful words again			0
' then she just said it - " it 's breast cancer again " - and i just could n't believe it , i just broke down			2
' the doctor cuddled me and hugged me and said " i 'm so sorry "			0
' i said " i ca n't go through chemo again , i just ca n't do it "			0
' she will now have to take the anti-cancer drug @entity192 for life			0
alongside the help of her son , @entity195 , she says she could not have got through the ordeal without the help of cancer charity @entity198			0
' they were so helpful to me emotionally and financially and even paid for me to go away for a holiday			0
' they also gave me a visit at home one evening when i was feeling pretty rough			0
' they really did see me through that bad time , and i will always be thankful to them for that			0
' ms @entity0 is now hoping to find out whether any other cancer sufferers in the @entity210 have gone through the same ordeal			2
she said : ' there was a lot of emotion there , but happiness at the end of it			0
' i 'm going to keep fighting it , i 'm not going anywhere , i 'm going to stay here and annoy more people and grow old disgracefully , as they say			0
' i should probably be happy that i 'm still alive , that i 'm still here , but i do n't want to leave it at that			0
' i 'm the type of person who needs an answer , and i want to help other cancer sufferers			0
' there must be other people who have been through the same thing , or who know what it is			0
' it 's been a long bumpy journey , with lots of highs and lows			0
' however , i 'm extremely grateful i 'm still here to tell the tale and i 'm just hoping to @entity243 that i will have a clean bill of health for the rest of my days			0
' a leading breast cancer charity said that ms @entity0 's third cancer diagnosis following a double masectomy was ' unusual			1
' ' it is not unheard of but extremely unusual , ' said @entity251 , a senior policy advisor at @entity252 , which funds research into prevention , detection and treatment of the @entity210 's most common cancer			0
ms @entity0 will now take anti-cancer drugs for the rest of her life to keep the tumour at bay			1
she hopes to find others like her - who developed breast cancer despite having had a mastectomy ' one in eight women will face breast cancer in their lifetime			1
after having a double mastectomy , it would be very rare for breast cancer to re-occur , ' she added			1
' it is always going to be a shock when breast cancer comes back , especially after a double mastectomy , ' she said			1
' it is unusual , but we have heard of such cases coming up			0
after removing most of the breast tissue , it can recur in the chest wall			2
' it could also spread to cells in other parts of the body , even after invasive surgery , and guarantees can never be made , she added			0
she reiterated that mastectomies hit the headlines in 2013 after actress @entity26 revealed she had undergone the surgery as a preventative measure as her brca gene mutation made her a high risk for developing breast cancer			1
emphasising that star 's preventative procedure was different from @entity0 's treatment for cancer , ms @entity251 said anecdotal evidence showed that ms @entity26 going public with her story had encouraged many women with a family history of breast cancer to come forward for tests .			1
