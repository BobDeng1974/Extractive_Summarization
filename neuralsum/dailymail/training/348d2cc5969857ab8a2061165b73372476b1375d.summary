@entity0 put her foot in her mouth again on the campaign trail yesterday , mixing up the personal story of the @entity6 senator she was campaigning for , @entity7 's @entity5 , with his @entity9 opponent in the race , rep. @entity8			1
' as a fifth generation @entity7 , @entity5 understands what makes this state special , ' @entity0 told attendees of a @entity16 rally for @entity5			1
@entity8 's family , not @entity5 's , has lived in @entity7 for five generations			1
@entity5 did not move to the @entity20 state until after college			1
the @entity6 lawmaker was born in @entity23			2
his father @entity24 represented the state in @entity26			0
@entity0 claimed at a rally in @entity16 that @entity7 sen. @entity5 if a ' fifth generation @entity34			1
that 's his opponent 's tag line sorry about that : @entity0 gives an awkward smile to @entity5 , left , and @entity7 gov. @entity42 , during a reelection rally for the two incumbent candidates , on the campus of @entity46 , in @entity47			1
earlier the day @entity48 went off script and messed up @entity5 's bio			1
she did n't make the same mistake again at her second rally with the two men seeking the backing of the @entity57 without having to be seen as an accomplice to the president , @entity6 @entity54 and gubernatorial candidates have latched onto the first lady this election cycle as a top surrogate			1
but mrs. @entity0 may be doing just as much damage to candidates ' campaigns as they fear appearances with her husband would bring about			2
at an event for the @entity6 nominee to the @entity54 in @entity70 , @entity71 , earlier this month @entity48 claimed the lawmaker was a @entity73 veteran			0
it 's his father , @entity75 , who is the @entity73 vet			0
@entity0 also called the sitting congressman the wrong name , repeatedly , until an audience member corrected her			0
' @entity71 , what did i say ? ' she asked			0
' @entity82 , ' the crowd shouted back at her			0
' i 'm losin ' it			0
i 'm getting old , ' she said , laughing the mistake off			0
' i 've been traveling too much			0
' indeed , the first lady has been on the road frequently in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections			1
today she is in @entity89 campaigning for @entity90 , the former @entity9 governor who now wants to lead the state on behalf of @entity6			1
yesterday she appeared at not one but two rallies for @entity5 and and @entity7 gov. @entity42 , who is also up for reelection on nov. 4			1
on tuesday she traveled back to @entity70 to campaign for @entity71 a second time			0
and while the increasingly forgetful first lady did not get his name wrong , the @entity57 mistakenly referred to him as governor of the state in its official transcript of the event			2
hours later the @entity57 acknowledged the blunder and sent out a corrected transcription of the first lady 's remarks , but it was too late			2
reporters nationwide had already posted stories detailing the @entity0 administration 's latest goof			2
president @entity111 has made his fair share of eyebrow - raising remarks throughout the last month , too			0
on two recent occasions @entity0 has suggested to his supporters that they should judge @entity6 candidates claiming to have independent policy agendas on his record instead			1
it 's my ' policies on the ballot , ' he said in an oct. 2 speech in @entity126 at @entity127			0
during a radio interview with @entity129 on monday @entity0 said incumbent @entity6 who are up for reelection ' are all folks who vote with me			1
' ' they have supported my agenda in @entity26 , ' he asserted			0
the @entity57 's sloppy politicking has begun to ruffle feathers among the party 's political class			1
they worry the string of mistakes has taken the focus off of @entity6 candidates ' accomplishments at a critical point in the election cycle			2
' it does n’t open up a new line of attack , but it freshens one right as voters are tuning in , ' a @entity6 strategist , who wished to remain anonymous , told the @entity154 on thursday			2
another operative , @entity155 , a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of high - profile democrats like deceased @entity159 sen. @entity158 and former @entity161 gov. @entity160 , said the verbal missteps of @entity57 and the first couple , while embarrassing , are not @entity6 ' most significant problem right now			1
' it is [ the president 's ] approval rating that is actually the real problem here , ' @entity155 told the @entity154			0
' that other stuff , that just is n’t helpful , ' he noted			0
the president 's favorability rating nationwide has n't crossed the 50 percent mark in the last year and a half			0
it 's particularly low in a handful of states @entity6 need to win in order to keep control of the @entity54 .			2

she mixed up the personal story of @entity7 sen. @entity5 with his @entity9 opponent in the race , rep. @entity8
' as a fifth generation @entity7 , @entity5 understands what makes this state special , ' @entity0 told attendees of a @entity16 rally for @entity5
@entity8 's family , not @entity5 's , has lived in @entity7 for five generations
@entity6 worry the @entity57 's sloppy politicking will cost their party the midterm elections
