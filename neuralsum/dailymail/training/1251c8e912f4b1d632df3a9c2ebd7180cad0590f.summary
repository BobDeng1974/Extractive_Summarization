by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 26 august 2013 more than 1,500 teachers with criminal convictions , including paedophiles and attempted murderers , have applied for jobs in schools in the past year , @entity1 can reveal			1
candidates also included drug dealers , burglars , thieves , fraudsters , flashers and blackmailers , and some may already have been working in a school or were given the job they wanted			0
officials do not know exactly how many of the criminals were taken on , as recruitment decisions are often at the discretion of individual schools			2
an mp today demanded more transparency on the issue because ' public confidence ' is at stake and ' parents have the right to know '			1
shock : more than 1,500 teaching staff who applied for jobs in @entity32 schools were found to have previous convictions , including serious sex , violence and drugs offences ( file image - the man pictured does not have any criminal convictions ) around 100 headteachers applied for new jobs even though they had criminal convictions , new figures released under the @entity45 show			1
these individuals had carried out offences including wounding , cottaging , @entity50 , theft , battery , burglary , benefit fraud , drugs offences , hit and runs , violent disorder and one even planned a bomb hoax			0
on top of this around 800 teachers and 600 teaching assistants with criminal records also asked schools for work in 2012 , many with some of the most serious convictions possible , including for child sex offences			1
the data also shows murderers , rapists and paedophiles were among 1,700 individuals who applied for jobs as caretakers , cleaners and dinner ladies			0
the details have been revealed by the @entity77 and @entity78 , who carry out criminal record checks for schools			1
every year there are also dozens of teachers and headteachers who carried out crimes while in work and were allowed to keep their jobs			2
controversial : @entity88 , 36 , got his job as a teacher back despite being caught with child porn , and @entity93 mp @entity92 says there needs to be a crackdown and more transparency in june a teacher who downloaded child porn was allowed to resume his career by the @entity100			1
@entity88 , 36 , was sacked , given a police caution and ordered to sign the @entity102 after admitting viewing sickening images over several years			0
but a professional conduct panel said the married @entity106 teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘ excellent teaching ’			1
pledge : the @entity100 ( pictured ) says there are strong safeguards in place but schools will often make the final decision conservative mp @entity92 told @entity1 : ' this is an issue of safety and parents need to have confidence about who is having contact with their children at school			1
' there needs to be an element of transparency about who has been employed and where			2
parents have the right to know			0
' certain serious criminals are almost always automatically barred from working with children , but in the majority of cases the final decision is at the discretion of the school			2
new figures show that almost 10,000 of people who committed crimes applied for jobs in @entity32 schools in the past three years			1
in @entity32 there is a list of crimes which automatically bans people from working with children			1
usually any child sex offenders can not work in schools , and nor can murderers and kidnappers , for example			0
those who have committed violent acts on vulnerable people including the mentally ill or disabled would also be barred automatically			2
it is also a crime not to declare your criminal record when applying for a teaching post			2
but with the majority of crimes candidates are allowed to explain themselves and get the opportunity to convince employers to take them on regardless of their past			0
the government said today there are strong procedures in place to protect children from criminals and said systems do stop criminals getting jobs in schools			0
' schools must carry out comprehensive disclosure and barring checks for anyone who applies to work with children ' , a spokesman said			0
' people who have committed the most serious crimes - as set out by the @entity77 - are automatically barred			0
employers review all applicants ’ criminal records before making a decision about whether to allow them to work in a school			0

majority of criminal acts do not prevent people teaching in @entity32 schools
100 heads , 800 teachers and 600 teaching assistants found to have previous
schools get to decide if a teacher should be employed in most cases
@entity199 calls for ' transparency ' on issue because parents ' have a right to know '
