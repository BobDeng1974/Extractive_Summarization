foreign secretary @entity0 told @entity1 said he wanted to increase support to ' moderates ' fighting to bring down president @entity5 @entity0 issued an ultimatum to @entity7 dictator @entity5 yesterday , warning @entity8 will arm the rebels seeking to oust him unless he comes to the negotiating table			1
the foreign secretary said there ’s a ‘ compelling case ’ for changing the @entity15 arms embargo on @entity7 next week to allow weapons to go to moderate rebel groups			1
he said ‘ no option ’ would be off limits if the @entity5 regime refuses to co-operate with plans for a peace conference in @entity22			2
mr @entity0 said no decision has been made yet			1
but he argued the @entity25 has a ‘ moral ’ duty to help those friendly to the outside world while @entity28 and @entity29 arm the regime and @entity32 states funnel weapons to @entity35 supporters			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ people who are maybe described as rebels but are actually men , women and children sitting in their communities suffering virtually every kind of weapon that man has ever created being dropped on them while the world denies them the means to defend themselves			1
’ mr @entity0 will join the @entity45 in an attempt to loosen the embargo at a meeting in @entity49 next monday , but if other @entity15 countries do n’t agree it will lapse at the end of the month			1
he said changing the embargo is ‘ essential ’ to force the @entity7 regime to negotiate			0
‘ the @entity8 and @entity45 are strongly of the view that changes to the embargo are not separate from the diplomatic work but essential to it , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
he repeated claims that between 70 and 100 @entity8 jihadis are fighting alongside @entity35 elements in @entity7			2
@entity60 would debate any decision to arm the rebels , he said			0
in a move that confirms the government is close to a decision , mr @entity0 spelt out three conditions applicable to any weapons offer			2
he told @entity1 : ‘ if we were to pursue this , it would be under the following conditions – in co-ordination with other nations , in carefully controlled circumstances and in accordance with our obligations under national and international law			0
’ @entity78 and @entity80 mps have warned the changes could drag @entity8 into a civil war that ’s already cost 70,000 lives			2
shadow foreign secretary @entity84 told mr @entity0 : ‘ i believe that the risks of what could be a decade - long sectarian war in @entity7 , fuelled in part by weapons supplied by the @entity8 , should give you serious pause for thought			1
’ former @entity80 foreign secretary @entity93 said : ‘ if the embargo is lifted , is there not a risk that this could lead to an escalation of an arms race between the @entity25 and @entity28 and @entity29			2
’ rebels : free @entity101 fighters prepare to launch a rocket in @entity103 in the eastern part of the country mr @entity0 added : ' with every week that passes we are coming closer to the collapse of @entity7 and a regional catastrophe , with the lives of tens of thousands more @entity7 at stake			1
' we are determined to make every effort to end the carnage , to minimise the risks to the region , and to protect the security of the @entity8			0
' the death toll from the conflict has doubled in the first five months of 2013 and now stands at 80,000 people			1
more than 4million @entity7 have been ' displaced ' and some 6.8million are in ' desparate need ' , including 3million children , mr @entity0 added			1

@entity132 said those fighting to bring down president @entity5 , including many @entity8 , will be ‘ radicalised ’ before returning home where they will pose a ‘ serious threat ’ to national security			2
it is feared some will become members of groups with links to @entity35 before launching terror attacks at home			0
mr @entity132 , the @entity15 ’s counter-terrorism coordinator , said : ‘ we are concerned , of course			0
’ he said most of the @entity134 agreeing to fight with the rebels were being converted by radicals in @entity7			0
‘ not all of them are radical one day when they leave but most likely many of them will be radicalised there , they will be trained , ’ he told the @entity151			0
‘ and as we have seen in previous situations this might create a serious threat when they get back			0
