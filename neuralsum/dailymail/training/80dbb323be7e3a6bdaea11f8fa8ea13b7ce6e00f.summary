click here to read the full match report @entity2 did not want to expose @entity3 to the coarse climes of @entity5 , where temperatures barely touched 3c and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium			1
instead , the player he believes will fire @entity11 to the top four was in @entity12 , relaxing and posting selfies amid the @entity14 surrounds of his ‘ winter break ’			1
@entity2 has made an exception with @entity3 , allowing him to enjoy a 10 - day rest period while his team - mates have negotiated an @entity20 tie at @entity22 @entity21 and a narrow victory at @entity5			1
@entity2 believes @entity3 will make the difference to @entity11 's season captain @entity26 ( left ) celebrates @entity28 's winner in the 1 - 0 defeat of @entity5 @entity3 was given an extended winter break in @entity12 from where he posted this selfie on @entity33 @entity5 have won just once at the @entity34 all season and have the worst home record ( nine points ) in the @entity38			1
but the @entity40 boss sees the 20 - year - old as an exceptional talent , and one which will make the difference in his side ’s quest for @entity49 football			1
‘ @entity3 was brilliant in the second half of last season			1
if we put him and ( @entity57 ) @entity56 in that team now , with that way of working , it will be fantastic , ’ said @entity2 , whose side have lost just one in nine in the @entity38 and are up to eighth			1
‘ we are aiming for the top four , absolutely			0
’ @entity3 was back on @entity60 on , and @entity2 will be expecting the @entity62 forward to reward him for keeping to the promise he made in the summer			1
‘ after the @entity64 i felt he needed a break but we had the @entity49 and a lot of games , ’ he explained			1
‘ we had a plan that this was going to be the best time , after the @entity72 period			0
‘ he will come back now and mentality it will freshen him up			0
it is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs			0
‘ we have put so much on him since he came into the team as a 17 - year - old			2
he has not had a break and has progressed through to being a full international player			0
’ @entity2 insists that @entity3 needed a rest to avoid being burnt out by the end of the season @entity3 scored four goals at the start of the season but has only netted once since september 27th @entity89 's @entity88 backs decision to give @entity3 a rest it was perhaps best for sorry @entity5 that @entity3 was not at the @entity34			1
for the crisp packets and sweet wrappers did not distract from the rubbish they served up on the pitch , especially during the first half			0
it was easy for @entity11			1
the only surprise was that they did not add to @entity28 ’s ninth - minute opener , a close - range poke after a forceful burst into the penalty area			1
emerging as the match - winner , however , at least afforded the @entity107 the headlines which will be hoped serve as a confidence boost			1
the 20 - year - old has struggled to impact since his £ 20million arrival from @entity112 , but @entity2 said : ‘ he is a top young talent			1
it shows more what a difficult league this is for any player to come in , let alone a very young player			0
then add the fact that he is coming to one of the biggest clubs in the world , so it takes time			0
‘ but a lot of our young players are starting to bed into our philosophy and the way we play			0
you will see them develop and come on a lot in the next six months			0
’ he added : ‘ i had a chat with @entity28 a while ago about his aggression and he got sent off in the next game			2
but i want him to be aggressive with and without the ball			0
he is a talent which is why he is at @entity11 and his performance was very good			2
’ @entity28 ( left ) is starting to find his feet after a struggling start to his @entity143 career @entity11 's win at the @entity34 has taken @entity11 to within five points of the top four the same can not be said about the hosts , whose display was lacking in energy and invention			1
they were arguably better after @entity152 was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on @entity156 , but they never truly threatened parity			0
@entity159 is frustrated that his team are not playing out the identity he has tried to impose and was alarmed at the manner in which they stood off the visitors			0
when asked about their lack of urgency and aggression , he said : ‘ only one @entity5 team has shown those characteristics – the team of @entity172 and @entity173			2
‘ the rest of the teams of @entity5 did not have any characteristics			2
they were playing for relegation and suffering			0
but we are miles away to a point that it worries me a little bit			0
’ worry , however , is not an emotion troubling @entity2 right now			2
rather , his mood on a windswept and chilly @entity184 was one of excitement			0
@entity11 ’s season might just be hotting up			2
@entity5 boss @entity159 ( centre ) is frustrated that his players have not played out his philosophy			2
