a family claim they were forced to sit in vomit aboard a @entity4 flight after staff refused to clean an affected area of floor before take - off			1
@entity9 , his wife @entity10 and seven - year - old son @entity12 , were travelling back to @entity13 after a birthday trip to @entity15 , @entity16 , when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew			1
after boarding the plane , the @entity20 were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet			2
it was then , that she noticed her bag was wet			2
' she then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet			1
when she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid , that 's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit			1
' given my wife suffers from @entity59 ( phobia of germs ) , she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit			2
' i immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that i too had had my hands all over this vomit			0
my wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind			1
' i told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms			0
' the @entity26 's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items mr @entity9 says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area , and that staff had cleaned the area			1
' it was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting , because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever , ' he added			2
' this was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks			0
' mr @entity9 described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking , and they were given two options by @entity4 staff ; fly out next day or remain in their seats			1
because mrs @entity26 had to go to work next day at the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats			1
the family were flying back on a @entity4 flight from @entity16 to @entity13 ( file photo ) however , staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area , and the passengers were given blankets , which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made			1
he told us we had to make a decision because he ca n't delay the other passengers			0
' it was at this point i felt as if they could n't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along			0
i told my wife that we should just take the next day flight			2
' she said it is n't an option for her due to her position with the @entity106 and the nine days she had already been on holiday			0
since we really had no choice in the matter , under duress of the situation , we agreed to the blanket option			0
' the family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in			0
' it was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family , ' added mr @entity9			1
' i felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us			0
this was the final straw for me			0
' we went straight to @entity4 customer service who told us they ca n't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there			2
this was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there			0
' with their luggage still bagged up , mr @entity9 says @entity4 have offered them a $ 150 flight voucher each and some ' mileage points ' a spokesperson for @entity4 told @entity37 : the situation mr @entity9 described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences , as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure			1
' we offered them an alternate flight , but they decided to remain onboard			2
our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate mr @entity9 and keep the flight on time			1
' we â€™re reaching out to apologise for his experience			0
' the family were offered a $ 150 flight voucher , or the option to file a claim for the baggage , which they chose to do			2
upon returning home , @entity4 has offered the each member of the family a $ 150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for mrs @entity26			1
however , mr @entity9 said : ' i personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell			1
' i do n't know what the lasting effects are going to be of this experience			0
we have to fly at least two more times later this year for weddings and i 'm beginning to think the train might be an option			0
' i felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were flying			0
all i could think about is what this vomit might have in it and if there was anything we would contact from it			0

@entity9 , his wife and son were returning from trip to @entity224
