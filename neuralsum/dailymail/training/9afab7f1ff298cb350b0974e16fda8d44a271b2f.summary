mental health staff have been accused of ' lamentable failures ' by a coroner after they left a man alone to kill himself despite having seen a noose on a visit to his home			2
@entity7 , 44 , was visited at his home in @entity9 by nurses @entity10 and @entity12 after being called to the house by @entity15 's crisis team			1
but mr @entity7 was found hanged the following day after the pair left him alone in the house despite his ' suicidal state of mind			1
' @entity7 , pictured with his estranged wife @entity18 , was found dead a day after a visit from two mental health nurses @entity21 had heard that mr @entity7 's relationship with his wife had broken down and he had been in relationships with two men who both died in tragic circumstances			1
coroner @entity27 said that mr @entity7 had probably been left depressed by personal tragedy , but added that his death could have been prevented had the nurses acted differently			1
following a two - day inquest , mr @entity27 said in a narrative verdict : ' @entity7 was the victim of lamentable failures of two experienced key workers from the @entity35 who , despite visiting @entity7 and observing a ligature in place and @entity7 's suicidal state of mind , left him alone in the house - placing the responsibility of @entity7 's safety on him , which enabled him to deliberately end his life by and act of self suspension at his home address			1
' @entity7 's death could have been prevented then had those key workers removed the ligature and remained with @entity7 , or alternatively arranged @entity7 's admission to hospital , either informally or pursuant to a section of the @entity52 or made immediate contact with @entity7 's family to stay with him until he could be seen by the @entity55 the next day			0
' following the verdict , mr @entity7 's sister @entity56 , also criticised the mental health workers			2
she said : ' if they had done their jobs right he would have been alive the next day			0
' mr @entity7 had been diagnosed with an adjustment disorder and was said to be drinking heavily			2
both mr @entity12 and mr @entity10 had been interviewed under police caution following mr @entity7 's death and were investigated to see if a charge of gross negligence manslaughter could be brought against them			1
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) spotted a noose at mr @entity7 's house but left him alone anyway , an inquest heard but the @entity70 had decided against a prosecution due to a lack of evidence			1
earlier in the hearing , mr @entity10 said that he was worried that he had no legal right to remove the noose from mr @entity7 's house			1
he said : ' i have been told previously that we had no legal right to do things like that and that was in the forefront of my mind			0
' when questioned by mr @entity7 's sister , @entity56 , about why the noose was left where the carers found it , he added : ' it does seem very damning but we were thinking about legal aspects of our behaviour as we do when we are in someone 's home			1
' that is that person 's home and they own everything in it			0
' i know it seems ridiculous but we do have rules to abide by , we are not happy about it			0
' speaking after the verdict mr @entity7 's sister @entity56 said : ' it 's good to see that see the coroner identified the failings			2
' @entity7 had presented historically as not engaging with the services so if he is not engaging with the services why did n't they take him away that night ? ' they were n't professional , they did n't behave in a professional manner			0
' if they had done their jobs right he would have been alive the next day			0
' who knows what would have transpired but the fact is we are talking about that day and that could have been and should have been avoided			0
' dr @entity119 , a psychiatrist and associate medical director with the trust , gave evidence at the inquest on monday			0
coroner @entity27 asked dr @entity119 : ' what these two nurses did was to try and seek reassurance from @entity7 that he would n't do anything inappropriate and he would engage with the service the next day			2
' dr @entity119 replied : ' yes			0
' mr @entity27 said : ' he has set up a ligature has n't he , which they saw ? ' he added : ' would you agree with me that it was foolish in the extreme to leave a person with @entity7 's history and mental health alone in his home when he has set up a ligature in the way he has , expecting him to voluntarily engage with the service the following day in the light of him being un-cooperative ? ' dr @entity119 said : ' i think without reducing the risk significantly , yes , i would agree with you			1
