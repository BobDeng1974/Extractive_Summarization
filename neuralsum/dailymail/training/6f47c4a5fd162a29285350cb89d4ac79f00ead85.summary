’ but one coalition mp , who did not want to be named , said mr @entity1 was adopting a ‘ condescending ’ tone			1
education secretary @entity69 believes headmasters at free schools and academies should have the same rights as those in private schools to hire untrained teachers if they are the best candidates ‘ he seems to be suggesting that parents who send their kids to state schools need help in discerning between good and bad teachers , while those who send their kids private already know that so do n’t need the guarantee , ’ the mp said			1

’ @entity122 : fluent in @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , the classicist could reel off vast tracts of @entity129 and @entity130 and would choose books he liked over what was required for the a-level curriculum			2
