by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 09:51 est , 25 may 2012 the world 's biggest and most advanced radio telescope , capable of detecting signs of extraterrestrial life in the far reaches of the universe , will be located in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			2
the decision to split the location of the $ 2 billion ‘ @entity12 ’ followed an intense battle between the bidders - @entity7 one side and a joint bid from @entity8 and @entity9 on the other			1
scanning the sky 10,000 times faster and with 50 times the sensitivity of any other telescope , it will be used to study the origins of the universe and will be able to detect weak signals that could indicate the presence of extraterrestrial life			2
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity7 will jointly host the largest ever radio telescope			0
it will have up to 50 times the sensitivity and 10,000 times the speed of current radio telescopes , say astronomers scanning the sky 10,000 times faster and with 50 times the sensitivity of any other telescope , it will be used to study the origins of the universe and will be able to detect weak signals that could indicate the presence of extraterrestrial life this picture taken on march 30 , 2010 shows the @entity41 construction site , in the @entity42			2
the combined collecting area of all the antennas will add up to one square kilometre @entity12 low frequency aperture arrays of the future @entity12 ( @entity12 ) radio telescope @entity8 and @entity7 will share the location for the world 's most powerful radio telescope scientists leading the project rejected the suggestion that the decision , which will mean higher costs , meant science had taken a back seat to political expediency			1
‘ we were all aware of the political dimensions of this , ’ said @entity58 , chair of the board of directors of the @entity12 organisation , but he added : ‘ it 's a scientifically motivated way forward			0
’ there is already infrastructure in @entity7 and @entity8 , including radio telescope dishes that were built as precursors to the new array			1
they will now be incorporated into the ska			0
the consortium estimates that the decision to split the project will add about 10 percent to the 350 million euro ( $ 440 million ) budget for the first phase of construction			1
when completed in 2024 the telescope will be made up of 3,000 dishes , each 15 metres wide , together with many more antennae , that together will give a receiver surface area of a square kilometre			1
‘ this hugely important step for the project allows us to progress the design and prepare for the construction phase of the telescope , ’ said @entity81 , director general of the consortium			0
‘ the @entity12 will transform our view of the universe ; with it we will see back to the moments after the @entity92 and discover previously unexplored parts of the cosmos			0
’ artist 's impression of some of the dishes that will work together to make up the @entity12 to process the data coming back from the @entity12 , @entity99 is designing a computer which will digest twice as much information every day as the entire internet , sifting through radio waves from space in an effort to unravel the origin of the universe			1
the machine will be attached to a 1,900 square mile array of telescope antenna , and will be built to ' suck in ' in radio telescope data which will ' see ' 13 billion years into the past , back to the dawn of the universe and the @entity92			1
the machine will be millions of times more powerful than the fastest pcs today - and will deal with 100 times more information than the output of the @entity120			1
the machine will be attached to a 1,900 square mile array of telescope antenna , and will be built to ' suck in ' in radio telescope data which will ' see ' 13 billion years into the past , back to the dawn of the universe and the @entity92 the amount of data gathered by the @entity12 's dishes will be twice the traffic on the entire internet - and 100 times bigger than the output of the @entity120 @entity131 of @entity99 resarch says , ' if you take the current global daily internet traffic and multiply it by two , you are in the range of the data set that the @entity12 radio telescope will be collecting every day			1
' upon completion in 2024 , the telescope will be used to explore evolving galaxies , dark matter and even the very origins of the universe dating back more than 13 billion years			1
@entity99 is to investigate using @entity145 ' stacks ' of computer chips to achieve the enormous computing power required by the @entity12			0
this extremely powerful survey telescope will have millions of antennas to collect radio signals , forming a collection area equivalent to one square kilometre but spanning a huge surface area - approximately the width of the continental @entity154			2
the @entity12 will be 50 times more sensitive than any former radio device and more than 10,000 times faster than today ’s instruments			2
the @entity12 is expected to produce a few exabytes of data per day for a single beam per one square kilometer			2
after processing this data the expectation is that per year between 300 and 1500 petabytes of data need to be stored			0
in comparison , the approximately 15 @entity164 produced by the large hadron collider at @entity166 peryear of operation is approximately 10 to 100 times less than the envisioned capacity of @entity12			1
this extremely powerful survey telescope will have millions of antennas to collect radio signals , forming a collection area equivalent to one square kilometre but spanning a huge surface area - approximately the width of the continental @entity154 @entity99 is researching technologies such as ' 3d ' computer chips to achieve the huge computing power required for the @entity12 the directors of the @entity12 project are to meet in @entity180 on 3 april to discuss the location of the huge telescope , scattered across 1,900 square miles of @entity184 's surface			1
it will start building in 2016			0
' it will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future , ' says @entity81 , interim director general of the @entity12 project			0
' we know we are going to discover things			0
' the @entity12 will consist of thousands of dishes across 1,900 miles , with a total surface area of one square kilometre , that will provide so much data that one astronomer has declared it will completely change our view of the universe			2
dr @entity204 , from the @entity206 @entity205 , told @entity207 : ‘ the @entity12 project will provide astronomers with a fantastic new tool which may well revolutionise our understanding of the universe			0
‘ with its huge area the telescope will show incredibly fine detail in galaxies , help test the theory of relativity by studying exciting and mysterious objects like black holes and allow astronomers to learn more about the early history of the universe			0
' numbers game : this artist 's impression shows the @entity12 's dishes , which will scan space for electromagnetic radiation - and hopefully reveal the universe 's secrets sensitive : the ska 's dishes will be able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away the final location for the @entity12 has yet to be decided the scientific community also believe that the @entity12 represents our best ever chance of finding out if there ’s life beyond our solar system			1
to do this will require ground - breaking technology			0
the @entity12 ’s 15m - dishes , which will detect electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects in space , will be the most sensitive ever built - able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away			1
these dishes will be complemented by low and medium frequency aperture arrays , which provide a large field of view and are capable of observing more than one part of the sky at once			0
medium frequency aperture arrays : these are capable of scanning more than one part of the sky at once space - aged kit : an artist 's impression of @entity12 's low - frequency aperture arrays good spread : this graphic illustrates how the dishes and apertures will be arranged as they scan the heavens @entity264 above : @entity12 will peer deep into space telling us about black holes , how stars are born and if there is alien life out there it will be carried on enough optical fibre cable of such quantity that it could be wrapped twice around the world			1
as yet , a location for it has n’t been decided , but @entity275 and @entity8 are both n the reckoning			0
they all offer areas with ideal conditions for telescopes , which must be well clear of electronic interference , such as that generated by mobile phones			0
it ’s hoped that construction will begin in 2016 , with the dishes coming online eight years later			0
a prototype of @entity12 called @entity287 , which consists of seven 16 - metre dishes , is undergoing testing in @entity7 's @entity41 desert			1
spaced out : the kat - 7 prototype in @entity7 's @entity292			2

*super-telescope* built from 3,000 dishes across three countries
will cost $ 2 billion
*ultra-powerful* machine will ' see back to dawn of time '
machine will process more than an ' exabyte ' of data every day - more than the entire internet , and enough to fill 15 million @entity306 every day
more powerful than a million of today 's fastest pcs
machine will output 100 times more information than @entity120
