by @entity0 published : 03:51 est , 21 july 2012 updated : 03:51 est , 21 july 2012 a murder trial turned into a farce when an interpreter confessed half - an - hour into vital evidence that he was a fake , filling in for his busy wife			1
the judge halted the trial of @entity9 , who killed her mother - in - law with a rolling pin , when the court realised interpreter @entity13 was leaving out key words and phrases in his translating			1
mr @entity13 was interpreting for @entity9 ’s husband , @entity17 , who spoke @entity18 , but struggled to even get the oath right for the @entity21 witness at @entity22 in @entity23			1
the judge temporarily suspended the murder trial of @entity9 , pictured , who was sentenced for battering her mother - in - law to death with a rolling pin he was finally caught out by junior counsel @entity29 , who also spoke the language , half - an - hour into the the faltering evidence			1
in the absence of the jury , mr @entity13 was forced to confess to mr @entity34 that he was not a qualified translator and was awaiting the results of his interpreter test			1
he later revealed that his wife - the booked interpreter - was busy and he had come to do her job instead			1
t comes after a series of problems with translators supplied by @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , who were recently given a @entity48 contract to supply translators to courts			1
judges and court officials across the country have criticised the @entity55 's deal with @entity45 after stories of translators failing to arrive for trials or unable to accurately interpret proceedings for defendants , witnesses and victims			2
@entity9 , 37 , was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment and told she would serve a minimum term of 11 years for battering her mother - in - law @entity64 to death with a rolling pin at her home in @entity68 last february			2
defence barrister @entity69 said mr @entity13 wrongly translated words , such as saying ' bitter ; instead of ' irritable ' and ' @entity71 ' instead of ' one @entity72 '			2
a second translator drafted in to cover the case , was ' completely out of her depth ' and in the end the case was only able to continue with the assistance of mr @entity29			1
unqualified interpreter @entity13 said he was covering for his busy wife at @entity22 , pictured in total it wasted a day of work at the court , at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds			1
mr @entity29 said : ' i could n’t believe the first interpreter was so woefully inadequate and then it happened again with the second who was completely out of her depth			0
' she did n’t understand a lot of words and phrases and her vocabulary was completely lacking			0
' if i had n’t spoken up then people in the court would have thought everything was being interpreted correctly			0
' it would have been to the detriment of our client - we could have had a miscarriage of justice			2
' that ’s the price you pay			0
' defence barrister @entity69 added : ' it ’s at the very heart of the justice system because the words are the evidence			2
' if you find , as a defence counsel , that you are calling evidence on words that are unreliable then that is the start of a miscarriage of justice			1
' mr @entity34 told the court : ‘ this is extremely unfortunate , to use a classic understatement			0
’ in a brief statement , @entity45 said it would not comment on individual cases			0
‘ any complaints received about interpreters are investigated thoroughly and , where necessary , the interpreter is suspended from working with @entity45 until the investigation is complete			0
' at that point @entity45 will either remove them from its register , reinstate them or provide further training , as appropriate , ’ it said			0
@entity45 has claimed its contract , which started formally on february 1 , would save the government £ 60 million over five years			0
but many interpreters said they had boycotted the firm in reaction to low rates of pay , claiming that led to a struggle by @entity45 to recruit translators , and prompting the use of untrained people in courts			2
the company is being monitored daily after failing to meet targets			0
it was eight per cent off target from january to april this year , prompting action from the @entity55 .			0
