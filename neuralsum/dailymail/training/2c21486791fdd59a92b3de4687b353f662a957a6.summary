by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 02:52 est , 6 march 2013 it reveals an incredible story of water moving around the globe - from freshwater gushing from the @entity6 's mouth to an invisible seam dividing the salty @entity8 from the fresher waters of the @entity10			2
the amazing image below was created from the first full year of surface salinity data captured by @entity15 's @entity14 spacecraft			1
the groundbreaking maps are helping experts find out exactly how the @entity19 's oceans operate - and if they are changing			1
scroll down to see an animated version of the image red colours represent areas of high salinity , while blue shades represent areas of low salinity , and the data from @entity15 's spacecraft covers the period from dec. 2011 through dec. 2012 launched june 10 , 2011 , @entity14 is @entity15 's first satellite instrument specifically built to study the salt content of ocean surface waters			1
the salinity sensor detects the microwave emissivity of the top approximately 1 inch ( 1 to 2 centimeters ) of ocean water - a physical property that varies depending on temperature and saltiness			0
the instrument collects data in 240 - mile - wide ( 386 kilometers ) swaths in an orbit designed to obtain a complete survey of global salinity of ice - free oceans every seven days			2
' with a bit more than a year of data , we are seeing some surprising patterns , especially in the tropics , ' said @entity14 principal investigator @entity51 , of @entity19 & @entity52 in @entity53			2
' we see features evolve rapidly over time			0
' researchers say one of the features that stands out most clearly is a large patch of highly saline water across the @entity60			0
this area , the saltiest anywhere in the open ocean , is analogous to deserts on land , where little rainfall and a lot of evaporation occur			0
a @entity15 - funded expedition , the @entity70 in the @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , traveled to the @entity60 's saltiest spot last year to analyze the causes behind this high salt concentration and to validate @entity14 measurements			1
' my conclusion after five weeks out at sea and analyzing five weekly maps of salinity from @entity14 while we were there was that indeed , the patterns of salinity variation seen from @entity14 and by the ship were similar , ' said @entity87 , @entity15 's physical oceanography program scientist			1
it is hoped the mission could provide data for several years			0
an earlier global map of the salinity , or saltiness , of @entity19 's ocean surface produced by @entity15 's new @entity14 instrument reveals a rich tapestry of global salinity patterns ' the @entity14 prime mission is scheduled to run for three years but there is no reason to think that the instrument could not be able to provide valuable data for much longer than that , ' said @entity105 , @entity14 project manager at @entity15 's @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 ' the instrument has been performing flawlessly and our colleagues in @entity111 are doing a fantastic job running the spacecraft , providing us a nice , stable ride			1
' the first year of the @entity14 mission has mostly been about understanding how the instruments and algorithms are performing , ' @entity105 said			0
' now that we have overcome the major hurdles , we can really begin to focus on understanding what the data are telling us about how the ocean works , how it affects weather and climate , and what new insights we can gain by having these remarkable salinity measurements			0
