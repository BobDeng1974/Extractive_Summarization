@entity0 has announced he is temporarily stepping down as anchor of the @entity2			1
the 55 - year - old managing editor of the @entity5 ' most watched network news program said in a statement saturday he has become ' too much a part of the news '			1
he added : ' i have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days , and @entity11 has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue			2
' upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us			1
' a source told the @entity21 will not be involved in any of the day - to - day editing of the program during his absence			1
the scandal unfolded after the broadcaster admitted his personal account of an @entity29 attack on his helicopter in @entity31 was false			1
@entity11 , who hosted the weekend edition of the @entity2 on saturday , mentioned the news about his colleague and read out a statement			1
however he did not elaborate and did n't mention the fact he will be taking over			2
while reporting on the ground he said he saw a body floating down the street , and caught dysentery from flood water			0
as a result of the controversy , the veteran journalist is at risk from rivals who want his job , according to the @entity57			0
former @entity2 presenter , and current @entity60 personality @entity58 , had been linked with the role , but a spokesman ruled her out on saturday			2
@entity0 confessed that he ' made a mistake recalling ' a flight he took on a @entity66 helicopter over @entity31 in 2003			1
' made a mistake recalling ' : @entity0 , shown left in @entity31 and right in the aftermath of @entity44 , has found his claims met with scrutiny in the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news , it has become painfully apparent to me that i am presently too much a part of the news , due to my actions			1
' as managing editor of @entity2 , i have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days , and @entity11 has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue			1
upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us			1
he has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade that miraculously did n't explode , and managed to land with no loss of life			2
in the most extreme version of the tale , told to @entity95 in march 2013 , he said : ' two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire , including the one i was in , @entity29 and @entity101			2
' in fact , he was on a different aircraft entirely , which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit			2
he recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper			0
@entity2 has launched an official probe into @entity0 , lead by @entity110 , its top investigative journalist			1
since the apology , questions were also raised about statements @entity0 made on coverage of @entity44 , which was one of his proudest moments at @entity2			1
he claimed to see a body floating down the street in the @entity119 of @entity42 , past the @entity120 where he was staying			0
sore spot : @entity0 's friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from @entity31 - the country from which @entity0 's much - maligned error stemmed in a 2006 interview he referenced the moment : ' when you look out of your hotel room window in the @entity119 and watch a man float by face down , when you see bodies that you last saw in @entity134 , @entity135 , and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country '			1
some are sceptical of the story , as the @entity119 was not extensively flooded in the disaster , bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street			0
he has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery , which medics have said was not prevalent during @entity44			2
nonetheless , @entity0 's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny			0
he led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with @entity154 in @entity31 , then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in @entity5 , included flooding in @entity158			0
as well as the internal probe , the @entity57 also reported that ' a secret task - force ' from the rival @entity162 network is also dredging up old footage of @entity0 in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny			1
according to the newspaper , @entity167 , the president of @entity168 , ordered the task - force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists			0
the @entity2 also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on @entity0 - his former @entity2 colleague @entity58 , now a big - name anchor at @entity174			1
a source told the paper : ' @entity58 still has deep , deep contacts at @entity2			1
she would love to return as the @entity2 anchor ... she wants to be back in the big leagues again			2
' others denied she had designs on the @entity2 top spot			0
replacement : @entity11 anchors the weekend editions of @entity2 's today show and @entity186 @entity11 anchors the weekend editions of @entity2 's today show and @entity186			1
the 55 - year - old also hosts the weekend edition of the @entity2			1
he has already spent time in the role he is taking over - having covered for @entity0 when he was having knee replacement surgery in august 2013			1
@entity11 's first job was as a dj for a country and @entity196 station during college			0
hoping for a career in the entertainment industry , he soon discovered he could only get a full - time job if he reported the news			2
the broadcaster spent 19 years with @entity204 beginning in 1981 , when he was hired as a reporter for @entity206 in @entity207			0
in august 2005 , he assumed full - time duties at @entity209 , where he became a substitute anchor for @entity2 and today			2
he then became a full - time co-anchor of @entity212 following the death of his predecessor @entity214			0
in september 2012 he faced embarrassment after turning up late to a saturday morning show , because he overslept			0
@entity11 took to @entity217 to alert viewers of his frazzled morning			0
' for the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @ todayshow i overslept ! ' he posted on his @entity217 account			0
the executive producer for the show ended up giving @entity11 a wake - up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment , in the @entity228 in @entity207 , to @entity229 in @entity230 where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m. he took the lead role during @entity2 's coverage of the @entity234 in 2012			1
and sleep also proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond			0
he was enjoying a nap on a train ride from @entity240 to @entity241 , in the north of @entity243 , when he overslept , missed his stop and ended up in @entity245 on august 7			0
he had to change trains four times over a time span of nine hours to get back where he needed to be			0
but in his typical good humor , the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over @entity217			0
' if ya got ta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than @entity258			0
catching some quick sights , ' he tweeted , adding that on his return trip he would be ' drinking lots of coffee			0
' during the coverage of the @entity264 in 2014 , he downed a shot of vodka with co-host @entity267			0
previous experience : @entity11 ( pictured right with @entity0 ) has already spent time in the role he is taking over - having covered for @entity0 when he was having knee surgery in august 2013 enjoying a drink : during the coverage of the @entity264 in 2014 , he downed a shot of vodka with co-host @entity267			1

@entity275 , 55 , said his actions have made him ' too much part of the news '
in a statement he said : ' upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us '
