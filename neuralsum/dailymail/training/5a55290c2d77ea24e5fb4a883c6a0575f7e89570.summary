it sounds like a most unlikely aphrodisiac			2
but scientists have discovered the venom from what ’s considered the world ’s deadliest spider could be the secret to bolstering a man ’s love life			1
toxins produced by the @entity11 , or @entity11 , appear to combat erectile dysfunction within 20 minutes of entering the body			1
tests carried out on rats show the venom boosts performance by increasing the release of nitric oxide , a chemical that dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow			1
this is similar to how existing impotence drugs work			0
in tests on rats the spider 's toxin boosted erections by triggering the release of nitric oxide the @entity11 is responsible for killing more people than any other arachnid			1
victims usually die within an hour of being bitten			0
it is also known as the banana spider because of its habit of stowing away in shipments of the fruit			0
in 2008 , a supermarket in @entity40 , @entity41 , was forced to close after an assistant spotted one of the spiders under a box of bananas as she stacked them			0
one in ten men in the @entity48 suffers erectile dysfunction at some point in their lives			0
although drugs such as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years , around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement			0
traditional treatment : @entity54 works in around 70 per cent of patients but the rest see no improvement for these men , the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis , or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ			1
a drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative			0
researchers from @entity77 and the @entity78 extracted the toxin , called @entity80 - 6 , from the deadly venom and injected it into rats which had age - related erectile dysfunction			1
they found the toxin boosted erections by triggering the release of nitric oxide , which boosts circulation in the male genitals by helping blood vessel walls relax			2
in a report on their findings , published in @entity92 , the researchers said : ‘ the decrease in erectile function associated with age was partially restored 15 to 20 minutes after injection with @entity80 - 6			2
’ @entity77 scientists first became interested in the deadly spider ’s ability to boost sexual performance when victims of bites reported major improvements in their sex lives .			2

the @entity11 is responsible for killing more people than any other arachnid
now scientists say it produces toxins that could have a blood - boosting effect
