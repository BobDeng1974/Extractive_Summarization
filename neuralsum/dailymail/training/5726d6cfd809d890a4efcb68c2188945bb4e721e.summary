the number of foreign prisoners is growing and attempts to remove them are often futile , a secret @entity1 report warns			0
the @entity6 document , marked restricted but leaked ahead of a crunch vote by @entity8 , reveals there are about 12,000 foreign prisoners in the @entity11 – and another 4,000 who have been freed after serving a sentence but not deported			1
their offences include murder , manslaughter , rape of a minor and kidnap			1
the number of foreign prisoners is growing and attempts to remove them are often futile , a secret @entity1 report warns the report predicts that numbers of more serious offenders will increase and admits : ‘ some countries are extremely difficult to remove a non-compliant person to ... these include @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
’ the leak came as rebel @entity32 mps will today threaten to back a @entity35 motion that would make it easier to deport foreign criminals after their sentence			1
@entity39 , whose move is supported by more than 100 mps , said the leaked document was ‘ a chilling analysis of the growing threat of foreign national criminals ’			1
he added : ‘ today @entity8 have a chance to steel our deportation capacity to protect the public			2
’ mr @entity39 ’s amendment to the government ’s @entity53 would require judges to deport foreign criminals jailed for over a year , unless they were at risk of torture or murder on return			1
it would effectively overrule the controversial @entity62 8 protection for family life contained in the @entity65 used by some foreigners to avoid deportation			0
@entity68 has indicated some sympathy with the idea but home secretary @entity71 is said to have vetoed @entity1 support for the change			0
@entity39 , whose move is supported by more than 100 mps , said the leaked document was ' a chilling analysis of the growing threat of foreign national criminals ' @entity76 is also said to have raised concerns			2
the @entity6 report , which appears to date from 2012 , says there were 10,779 foreigners serving time in @entity11 prisons , 1,431 who had served time but were still detained pending removal , and 4,238 now ‘ non-detained ’ because there was ‘ no reasonable expectation of removal in the short term ’			1
it warns that polling data shows that removing foreign prisoners at the end of their sentence is considered ‘ one of the key priorities ’ for the @entity95 by the public			2
’ ‘ individual cases continue to receive high - profile media coverage , more recently focusing on the @entity11 ’s inability to deport individuals due to @entity62 of the @entity65 , ’ it continues			1
the report warns that the number of ‘ non-detained , time - served ’ foreign prisoners has ‘ increased due to accumulation of hard to remove cases and longer time spent in the @entity11 ’			2
it says data from late in 2011 showed that 111 ‘ non-detained ’ foreigners had committed the most serious offences , including murder , manslaughter , rape , rape of a minor , sex offences against children , indecent assault of a minor or terrorist offences			1
a further 485 had committed serious offences including attempted murder , attempted rape , kidnapping , sex offences , violent crime , indecent assault , armed robbery and conspiracy to murder , kidnap or defraud			1
last night , home secretary @entity71 attempted to appease the @entity32 backbenches by promising to strip @entity11 terror suspects of their citizenship ‘ the absolute numbers of these types of offenders will increase , ’ the report adds , suggesting the total number of serious offenders will rise to 646 by april of this year			1
last night , home secretary @entity71 attempted to appease the @entity32 backbenches by promising to strip @entity11 terror suspects of their citizenship			2
under the tough new rules , officials would be able to remove a fanatic ’s passport even if it leaves them technically stateless			0
the move would mean that , if the extremist ever left @entity11 , they would find it near impossible to return			0
but the last - minute intervention failed to quell @entity32 anger over the @entity6 ’s handling of the @entity149 , which returns to the @entity35 today			1
the @entity6 has tabled dozens of amendments to the legislation and limited the time available for debate to just four hours - meaning that the rebels ’ concerns may not even be discussed			1
mr @entity39 added : ‘ the government is trying the old trick of squeezing awkward amendments off the agenda			0
it beggars belief that the most popular amendment , with cross-partly support , is n’t guaranteed even a minute of debating time			0
it risks strengthening the perception that the political elite wo n’t address the issues ordinary people care about - and that is @entity168 ’s feeding ground			0
’ fellow @entity32 mp @entity169 described the @entity6 ’s handling of the issue as ‘ a complete farce ’			1
he added : ‘ it looks very much like the government is going to use @entity176 tactics to try and stifle debate on issues that are of huge concern to the public			0
if ministers get their way we will have no vote and no more than a token debate - it is a gift to @entity168			0
’ dozens of conservative mps have signed another amendment that would re-impose the restrictions on @entity192 and @entity193 immigrants which lapsed at the beginning of this month			2
ministers say the move would be illegal under @entity199 law			0
government sources said mrs may was planning to come forward with her own proposals for curbing the use of @entity62 8 in the coming months			0
‘ there is a lot of sympathy for doing something on this , but it has to be legally watertight , ’ a source said			2
the home secretary already has the power to take away @entity11 citizenship from those with dual nationality			0
to date , she has confiscated the @entity11 passports of 16 individuals alleged to have links with terror groups			0
but she now intends to go much further by also removing citizenship from people who gave up their original nationality to become @entity11			0
a spokesman for legal charity reprieve said : ‘ this is a very alarming development , which reverses a long - standing ban on citizenship - stripping where doing so would leave someone stateless			0
‘ it would give the home secretary the power to tear up people ’s passports without any need for the kind of due process we might once have expected as @entity11 citizens			2
’ a @entity6 source said last night that the department ‘ does n’t recognise ’ the content of the leaked report and it was ‘ not true ’ that deportation efforts to some countries were becoming futile .			1
