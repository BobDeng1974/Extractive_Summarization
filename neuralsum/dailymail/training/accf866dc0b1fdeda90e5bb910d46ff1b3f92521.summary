by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 was accused of hypocrisy yesterday over @entity7 ’s ‘ racist ’ @entity6 immigration campaign posters because he employs his @entity9 wife as his secretary			1
but as senior figures from the three main parties attacked his party ’s latest publicity drive , the @entity7 leader insisted that no @entity17 person could do the taxpayer - funded job taken by his second wife , @entity19			1
the anti-eu party is using a £ 1.5million donation from a multi-millionaire businessman to launch a poster campaign for next month ’s @entity25 elections focused on immigration from the continent			2
@entity7 ’s opponents have likened the posters to those used in the past by the far - right @entity53			2
mr @entity3 yesterday dismissed the criticism as ‘ nonsense ’ , but ran into trouble when he was confronted by the @entity32 ’s @entity31 over his employment of his publicity - shy @entity9 wife as his secretary using @entity6 allowances			1
‘ she came here as a highly skilled person earning a high salary paying a very large amount of tax , ’ the @entity7 leader insisted			2
‘ i do n’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day			2
‘ it ’s a very different situation to a mass of hundreds of thousands of people coming in and flooding the lower end of the labour market			2
’ asked whether a @entity17 person could take the position as his secretary , mr @entity3 said : ‘ nobody else could do that job , not unless they were married to me			1
’ mr @entity3 said his wife earned a ‘ very modest ’ wage , of up to £ 30,000 a year , and worked ‘ extremely unsociable hours ’ for ‘ up to ’ seven days a week			1
' nobody else could do that job ' : mr @entity3 gave a stout defence of his wife 's @entity6 taxpayer - funded role mr @entity3 faced embarrassment yesterday after it emerged that a woman posing as a voter in @entity7 ’s manifesto actually works for him			1
@entity91 ( right ) appears in a full - page photograph as a voter from @entity94 , with a large quote stating : ‘ i ’ll be voting @entity7 because they ’re the only party listening to what people want			2
’ but miss @entity99 , who is half @entity100 , works in @entity101 and on her @entity103 account she describes herself as ‘ @entity104 and assistant to @entity3 , as well as a lover of social occasions ’			1
he pointed out that one in four mps at @entity109 and more than 70 other @entity17 @entity110 also employ a close family member			2
@entity113 former defence minister @entity112 , the grandson of @entity114 , became the first senior member of his party to attack the poster campaign , funded by internet and property tycoon @entity119			1
his intervention was seen as significant because he chairs a cross-party group on migration which is often critical of government policy			1
‘ at a time when our country really needs to come together , the @entity7 advertising campaign is deeply divisive , offensive and ignorant , ’ mr @entity112 said			1
@entity130 mp @entity129 , former chairman of the @entity132 foreign affairs committee , had already said that he hoped the ‘ racist posters encourage all decent @entity135 and @entity6 citizens ’ to vote for another party in the @entity25 elections on may 22			1
speech : @entity7 leader @entity3 launches his party 's @entity25 election bilboard campaign in @entity141 @entity145 workers who arrived in @entity17 to pick fruit have graduated to better jobs and now feel fully ‘ at home ’ here – with some even joining @entity7 , the country ’s ambassador revealed yesterday			1
@entity150 ( right ) said that , initially , his countrymen and women were doing low - skilled jobs when they moved to @entity17 after @entity145 joined the @entity6 in 2004			1
but they have now learned @entity154 , obtained qualifications in @entity17 schools and colleges and won ‘ promotion ’ to better jobs			2
some had become involved in @entity17 politics			2
in an interview with the @entity161 , @entity145 ’s ambassador to @entity101 said : ‘ there are some relatively young people from @entity145 who are members of @entity7 and they have this group , @entity165 in @entity7			2
’ but he insisted he was not condemning those planning to vote for @entity7 in the @entity25 elections but the party ’s poster campaign			2
‘ i stand by my view that this is a racist , xenophobic campaign designed to win votes by whipping up animosity against foreigners living and working and contributing to this country , ’ he said			0
@entity177 president @entity177 said the posters were ‘ wrong not just factually but morally ’			0
former @entity130 activist @entity179 said @entity7 was ‘ worse ’ than the @entity53 , which was now ‘ finished ’ as a political force			0
‘ the @entity53 were racist , but at least they had the courage to be open about their racism , ’ he added			0
@entity7 ’s deputy leader , @entity184 , said @entity185 were trying to close down a debate over immigration ‘ by shouting racist ’			0
he said : ‘ the fact of the matter is that we ’ve got wage compression in this country , we ’ve got uncontrolled borders			0
and the only way we ’re going to get control of our borders is by leaving this club [ the @entity6 ]			1
’ @entity7 yesterday unveiled four posters for next month ’s @entity25 elections , which immediately sparked allegations of ‘ racism ’ from the party ’s opponents			0
here , @entity206 editor @entity205 investigates the claims made by the controversial posters			1
claim : 75 per cent of our laws are now made in @entity212			0
reality : no simple answer			0
@entity7 ’s estimate is based on figures produced by @entity219 @entity218 president @entity217			0
@entity220 , an @entity221 , recently put the figure closer to 70 per cent			0
@entity177 leader @entity223 claimed in a tv debate with @entity3 that it is only 7 per cent			1
the independent @entity226 says ‘ it is possible to justify any measure between 15 and 50 per cent ’			0
it depends on whether the figures include only primary legislation passed by the @entity17 @entity218 , or all laws and regulations influenced by , or related to , @entity212			0
@entity234 : the @entity17 pays £ 55million a day to the @entity6 and its @entity235			1
the figure – the equivalent of £ 20billion a year – is roughly what the @entity238 paid to @entity6 institutions in 2012			1
however , the @entity17 does get around £ 8billion of this money back in the form of the rebate negotiated by @entity244 and other payments , such as subsidies to farmers			0
this still leaves the @entity17 making a net contribution of around £ 12billion a year , or £ 33million a day			0
@entity234 : @entity17 workers are hit hard by @entity6 policy that allows unlimited cheap labour			1
reality : last month a @entity238 report concluded that ‘ there is evidence for some labour market displacement in recent years when the economy was in recession ’ , with the low - skilled most likely to lose out			0
the @entity259 found that for every 100 extra foreign - born working - age migrants in the @entity17 , there was a reduction of 23 in the number of @entity17 in employment			0
labour and the @entity265 have made similar comments to the @entity7 poster in recent weeks			0
the poster carries a warning that 26 million unemployed people across @entity25 are ' after ' @entity17 jobs @entity234 : 26million people in @entity25 are looking for work			0
reality : there were 25.622million people unemployed across the @entity6 in february , according to @entity6 figures			1
this includes the 2.2million unemployed people in @entity17 , most of whom are @entity17 citizens			0
of course , not every jobseeker in @entity25 plans to move to the @entity17			0
but , as the eurozone continues to struggle , the @entity17 has become an increasingly popular destination for workers from southern @entity25			0
last year , @entity286 numbers were issued to 51,000 @entity287 , 44,000 @entity288 and 30,000 @entity289			0
ministers have blamed the upturn in @entity6 immigration to @entity17 for the increase in net migration , which currently stands at 212,000 a year			1
married man : @entity3 has previously said that his wife @entity19 's ' brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance ' @entity300 - born @entity39 , née @entity301 , keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public			1
at @entity7 conferences , she sits anonymously in the audience			0
the @entity7 leader has previously said of the moment he met @entity19 : ‘ she was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance			1
' she could have stepped into a @entity311 painting no questions asked			0
’ @entity19 , 49 , gave up her career in the @entity314 , where she worked as an interpreter for a @entity9 bank , to look after the children - she and mr @entity3 have two - and do her husband ’s correspondence			1
she writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers			0
she is paid a salary by the @entity218 of more than £ 27,000 and has amassed more than £ 200,000 since she began working for him			1
she works from home and rarely visits @entity7 ’s hq in @entity101 ’s @entity325 , which she has described as a ‘ freak show ’ .			2

mr @entity3 met his @entity9 former government bond broker wife in 1996
she now works as her husband 's secretary , paid for by @entity6 taxpayer cash
' nobody else could do that job , ' claims mr @entity3 in defence of her role
