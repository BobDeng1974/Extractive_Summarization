by @entity0 what did @entity2 legends @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have in common ? they were all 25 - years - old when they played in the tournaments that made them all - time greats			1
going by recent history , 25 is the perfect age to enter a @entity2 if you want to become a superstar			1
perfect age : @entity4 was a 25 - year - old when he took the world by storm with @entity20 @entity21 : @entity5 led @entity22 to victory in 1998 before @entity6 did with @entity24 in the 2002 tournament champion : a 25 - year - old @entity3 led @entity27 to @entity2 victory in 1982 after returning from a two - year ban @entity4 , @entity30 , 1986 @entity2 born : october 1960 @entity20 apps / goals : 91/34 @entity5 , @entity33 , 1998 @entity2 born : june 1972 @entity22 apps / goals : @entity35 @entity6 , @entity36 , 2002 @entity2 born : september 1976 @entity24 apps / goals : 98/62 @entity3 , @entity38 , 1982 @entity2 born : september 1956 @entity27 apps / goals : 48/20 and @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 are among the high - profile players who hope the tradition continues in @entity24 2014			1
at 25 , you ’re still at the peak of your physical powers but have experience and know - how too			0
even more importantly , you should be able to handle pressure and bounce back from adversity			0
@entity3 won the 1982 @entity2 for @entity27 having returned from a two - year ban for his part in a match - fixing scandal			1
he did n’t score in his opening four games in the tournament , then bagged six in three game in including a famous hat - trick against @entity24			0
@entity4 could n’t handle the expectation as a 21 - year - old in 1982			2
four years later , he was @entity20 ’s captain and main man in lifting the trophy , scoring or creating 10 goals in seven matches			0
@entity5 celebrated his 26th birthday right in the middle of the @entity66 when he inspired @entity22 to win the trophy on home soil and cement his place in history			2
four years later , @entity24 ’s @entity6 – who suffered a near - nervous breakdown before the @entity66 final - came back stronger and wiser at 25 to win the @entity72 with eight goals as @entity24 became world champions for a record fifth time			2
now , in 2014 , a new generation of 25 - year - olds are ready to take the world by storm			0
who 's next ? @entity4 led @entity20 to @entity2 glory and gave himself legendary status in 1986 born : october 1988 apps / goals : 55/17 @entity40 , germany @entity87 playmaker who sprinted away from @entity88 to destroy @entity89 ’s @entity2 hopes four years ago			1
had a difficult debut season in the @entity91 with @entity92 , missing a crucial penalty against @entity94 in the @entity95 , but loves the @entity97 role given to him by @entity100 coach @entity99			0
‘ we are travelling to @entity24 to win the @entity2 and show our thanks to the many fans in @entity100 and all over the world , ’ says @entity40			1
‘ the most important thing for me is that i have been given the freedom to move either left or right , or even deep to pick up the ball			0
that suits me very well			0
’ the right age : @entity40 destroyed @entity89 's hopes four years ago and is now 25 for the tournament in @entity24 born : december 1988 apps / goals : 66/23 @entity42 , chile hugely - talented @entity117 forward who began his @entity2 with a goal and assist in @entity120 ’s 3 - 1 win against @entity121 on friday			1
having scored 19 @entity123 goals last season , £ 25million @entity42 is entering the peak of his career and @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 are among the clubs monitoring his situation at the @entity132 in case new manager @entity133 wants to make changes			2
‘ if i did not believe that @entity120 could be world champions , i would have stayed at home , watching the games on the tv , ’ says the confident winger			0
talent : @entity42 began his @entity2 with a goal and an assist in @entity120 's 3 - 1 win over @entity121 born : october 1988 apps / goals : 3/0 @entity41 , @entity147 controversially chose to play for his adopted @entity147 instead of @entity24 and is key to their hopes of retaining the @entity2 despite being substituted in a disastrous 5 - 1 defeat by @entity151 in their opening game on friday			1
@entity154 is close to signing the £ 32million centre - forward from @entity156 as a proper replacement for @entity158 and though @entity41 has been troubled by hamstring problems in the build - up to the @entity2 , his physical presence gives @entity147 a different option			1
may not have hit the ground running at @entity164 but @entity3 and others have shown in the past it ’s how you finish rather than how you start that counts			0
@entity168 : £ 32million - rated striker @entity41 opted for @entity147 over @entity24 and could be key to their @entity2 hopes born : october 1988 apps / goals : 7/2 @entity173 , @entity24 one of four @entity175 players named by @entity176 in @entity24 ’s squad and though he did n’t feature in the opening - night victory against @entity181 , his athleticism and power will be needed as the tournament progresses			1
@entity176 is a huge @entity173 fan and he named is as one of the eight certainties in the @entity24 squad back in april – two months before he had to finalise his squad			0
@entity175 : @entity24 's @entity173 can have an impact in @entity176 's side on their home soil in the @entity164 born : july 1988 apps / goals : 27/5 @entity193 , @entity24 there was n’t a single @entity197 player in the @entity89 @entity2 squad – but @entity193 not only made the 23 - man party for hosts @entity24 , he started the win against @entity181 as a midfield enforcer to help protect the home defence			1
@entity193 scored nine goals for @entity197 in his debut season in @entity89 and his all - round play in the @entity208 engine room makes him an important component in the team			0
alone : @entity193 ( right ) was a midfield enforcer against @entity181 for @entity24 's @entity2 opener on thursday born : may 1989 apps / goals : 77/14 @entity215 , @entity216 too lightweight to make it in the @entity91 with @entity197 but his dazzling skills are made for a @entity2			1
sensational in @entity216 ’s win against @entity220 on friday , and was wrongly denied two goals after wrongly being called offside			0
@entity222 : @entity215 ( right ) can put his skills that were n't used in the @entity91 to use in @entity24 born : january 1989 apps / goals : 48/5 @entity226 , @entity227 while @entity91 fans know all about @entity230 and @entity231 , @entity227 supporters regard @entity226 of @entity233 club @entity232 as the most important individual in their team			2
@entity226 is the heartbeat of the @entity227 side , their @entity238 who protects the back four and drives everyone else on			0
@entity227 are @entity2 dark horses , and @entity226 may be a dark horse for player of the tournament			1
he ’s certainly the right age ! the unknown : @entity226 can inspire @entity247 in @entity24 and is at the heart of the side - their ' @entity238 '			2

@entity40 , @entity42 , @entity41 , @entity173 , @entity193 , @entity215 and @entity226 are all the perfect age *...* 25
@entity2 legends @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 were all 25 when they lit up the tournament
