new research has shown a correlation between the rise of the @entity3 and the decline of @entity5 claiming religious affiliation			1
other factors , such as an increase in higher education , are also implicated , but according to @entity10 , a computer scientist at the @entity11 in @entity12 , the increase in internet usage has a significant correlation			1
the @entity16 reports that in 1990 , eight per cent of @entity5 had no religious affiliation			0
in 2010 , that figure stands at 18 per cent , or 25 million people			1
religious figures : @entity10 says that increased internet usage correlates to about 25 per cent of the drop in religiosity @entity10 analyzed data from the @entity25 , a well - respected annual research survey carried out by the @entity27 , to make his findings			1
@entity10 says the single biggest cause of religious affiliation is upbringing : those you are raised in religious households are much more likely to remain in their family 's religion as adults			0
however , since 1990 , the number of people who had relgious upbringings has fallen , leading to a decrease in religious individuals - but @entity10 says that can only account for 25 per cent of the drop			2
higher education at the college level is also correlated with the drop in religion , but although the number of people receiving a college education has increased 10 per cent since the 1980s , @entity10 says it only accounts for a five per cent drop			1
crossed off : about 25 million fewer @entity5 have religious affiliations today than back in 1990 by far the largest factor , says @entity10 , is @entity3 use			1
in the 1980s , internet use was virtually non-existent , but in 2010 , 53 per cent of people spent two hours online a week and 25 per cent spent more than seven hours			0
@entity10 is careful to note that his research has revealed a correlation and not a causation			0
a relationship between the rise of the @entity3 and the drop in religion exists , but one is not directly responsible for the other			0
@entity10 says that his research has controlled for ' most of the obvious candidates , including income , education , socioeconomic status , and rural / urban environments ' to discount a third factor , one that is responsible both for the rise of internet use and the drop in religiosity			2
however , that still leaves a 45 per cent drop in religious affiliation that is unaccounted for			2
' about half of the observed change remains unexplained , ' @entity10 told the @entity16 .			0

new research shows that the number of @entity5 with religious affiliations has dropped by 18 per cent , or 25 million people
computer scientist @entity10 says there is a correlation between the drop and the rise of internet use
he says the increased usage of the internet correlates to 25 per cent of the drop
