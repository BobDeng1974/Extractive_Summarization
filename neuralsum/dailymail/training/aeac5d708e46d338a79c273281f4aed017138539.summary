miracle : @entity10 ( centre left ) developed a rare , life - threatening disease just days before her daughter @entity17 's wedding			1
she made it to the big day thanks to the help of 137 medics			1
( pictured with husband @entity29 ( left ) , her daughter @entity17 and the wedding party doctors performed special out - of - hours scans and worked from home to diagnose mrs @entity10 with @entity33 - an extremely rare disease which attacks the vital organs			1
the mother - of - three immediately started treatment but was so weak her family thought she would n't make the ceremony			2
but nurses at @entity40 rearranged rotas so they could drive her to the venue by ambulance , and accompany her throughout the ceremony			2
the team at the event even did her hair , nails and make - up for the occasion			2
mrs @entity10 , from @entity51 , @entity52 , said : ‘ it was way beyond their jobs and i would n’t have made it to the wedding without them			2
‘ this hospital has been fantastic and the care i received on the @entity61 was outstanding , especially the way they got me to the wedding			2
’ emotional : mrs @entity65 's daughter @entity17 embracing nurse @entity65 who nursed her mother in the lead up to the big day			1
ms @entity65 and her colleagues at the @entity69 and @entity70 helped get the mother - of - the - bride up and about her daughter @entity17 , who married @entity73 , added : ‘ i did n’t know mum was going to be there until the last minute			0
‘ when i ’d walked down the aisle , i just ran over and gave her a big hug , it was really emotional			0
’ mrs @entity10 had been plagued with a host of seemingly unrelated symptoms for two months ahead of her daughter ’s big day , on august 2			1
@entity33 syndrome is a disorder characterised by blood vessel inflammation			0
this inflammation can restrict blood flow to vital organs and tissues , sometimes permanently damaging them			0
asthma is the most common sign of @entity33 , but the disorder can cause a variety of problems , ranging from hay fever , rash and gastrointestinal bleeding to severe pain and numbness in the hands and feet			0
the wide range of signs and symptoms and their similarity to those of other disorders makes @entity33 challenging to diagnose			0
the condition is rare and has no cure			0
but the symptoms can usually be controlled with steroids and drugs that suppress the immune system			0
source : @entity113 she was rushed into hospital on july 25 , after suffering an acute headache and loss of movement in both arms			1
doctors carried out tests but , unable to find a cause for her symptoms , ordered a special mri scan			2
consultant @entity126 heard about the upcoming wedding and rallied colleagues			0
he said : ‘ i spoke urgently with my radiology colleague , dr @entity129 , who went out of her way to perform a very specific type of @entity125 which is generally not available out of hours			0
’ the results of the scan were so unusual that dr @entity129 phoned dr @entity126 at home to discuss them			0
the pair diagnosed @entity33 syndrome and immediately ordered intravenous steroids and chemotherapy			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ the team were fantastic pushing through my scan outside of normal hours - if they had n’t diagnosed me when they did , i either would have had very severe brain damage or not been here at all			1
’ mrs @entity10 was left ‘ severely weakened ’ by the treatment and staff set up an @entity146 with @entity147 so she could watch the wedding over the internet , from her hospital bed			1
@entity152 : ' [ the staff went ] way beyond their jobs and i would n't have made it to the wedding without them , said mrs @entity10			2
' the care i received was outstanding ' but determined ward sister @entity161 reorganised the rotas so mrs @entity10 could be escorted to the wedding at @entity164 near @entity165 in @entity52 , by staff nurse @entity65			1
@entity166 said : ‘ @entity10 being rushed into hospital was a horrible scenario for the whole family and if there was one thing that we could have done to improve things , getting @entity10 to the wedding was it			1
‘ i am so proud of my team as everyone went out of their way to ensure this could happen			0
’ mrs @entity10 is hoping for a good recovery and continues to take medication .			0
