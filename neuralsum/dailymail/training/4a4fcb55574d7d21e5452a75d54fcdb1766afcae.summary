by @entity0 @entity2 - driving @entity1 ¿ s three - and - a - half years as chief executive had been a very bumpy ride the change at the top of @entity7 was sudden and brutal			1
but perhaps it was inevitable , considering that @entity2 - driving @entity1 ’s three - and - a - half years as chief executive had been a very bumpy ride			1
certainly , since taking over the wheel from shopping industry genius sir @entity13 , he looked an increasingly isolated figure , not knowing in which direction to move			0
@entity1 had been entrusted with turning round the core grocery enterprise , with a market share of 30 per cent , but instead the @entity20 giant proceeded to lose a huge volume of custom			1
until then , for more than two decades , @entity7 could do no wrong			1
while other supermarkets ( most notably @entity24 ) floundered , @entity7 , first under @entity25 and then under sir @entity13 , became a commercial powerhouse , dominated @entity29 high streets and edge - of - town shopping centres and took its brand overseas			1
taking advantage of the break - up of the @entity36 bloc in eastern @entity37 , it established itself as the biggest supermarket group across the region from @entity40 to @entity41 – as well as venturing into @entity42 and @entity43			0
although sir @entity13 recognised the domestic market was changing too – and spotted potential from a new generation of smaller convenience stores – he failed to pay sufficient attention to the core @entity29 grocery business			0
at the high point of his @entity7 career , one in every seven pounds spent by @entity29 was in one of his stores			1
but then , suddenly , after he quit , the retail environment changed rapidly – and the @entity7 he had built was n’t ready for it			2
the financial collapse of 2007 - 09 , followed by recession , put a huge strain on disposable incomes			2
cash - strapped shoppers headed to @entity7 ’s price - cutting rivals : @entity64 ( owned by the @entity66 giant @entity67 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
those with more money moved upmarket to @entity73 , @entity74 and , to a lesser extent , @entity24 ’s			0
when i interviewed @entity1 shortly after he became boss , i noticed that he seemed a little overawed			2
although a career @entity7 - man who had begun as a shelf - stacker in his native @entity81 and looking like a sir @entity13 clone , he seemed distracted and kept fiddling with his @entity83			1
clearly , like all successful retailers , @entity7 had a strong digital model and home delivery service , but @entity1 adopted a scattergun approach to novel ideas , hoping that at least some would work			1
they included the store launching its own @entity93 tablet , loaded with @entity7 apps , and directing customers to services from home furnishing to funerals , insurance and digital banking			2
@entity7 had a strong digital model and home delivery service , but @entity1 adopted a scattergun approach to novel ideas @entity1 also improved the look of some very tired - looking @entity7 shops and made some upmarket moves such as buying the @entity109 restaurant chain and artisan coffee stores @entity111 + @entity112			1
however , what people want , particularly at a time of great financial squeeze , is bargain prices.the ‘ pile it high , sell it cheap ’ tradition of @entity7 ’s mercurial founder sir @entity119 barely seemed to be on his radar			2
it turned out that parts of the @entity13 legacy , especially @entity123 ( the chain of grocery stores set up in the @entity66 that cost the firm nearly £ 2billion ) , were serious mistakes			0
similarly , investment in @entity131 distracted @entity1 ’s attention from crucial changes back home			2
online shopping was rapidly taking trade from out - of - town @entity7 superstores			1
for example , why on earth would shoppers buy a big screen tv from @entity7 – with a limited selection – when firms such as @entity145 offered more choice , similar prices and free delivery ? at the high point of his @entity7 career , one in every seven pounds spent by @entity29 was in one of his stores also , @entity7 ’s huge high street range of products began to look superfluous in an age of austerity – whereas @entity69 , @entity159 shrewdly offered a limited choice at bargain prices			1
and while @entity1 invested time and money in home delivery , @entity7 ’s stores were neglected			1
many looked as if they had n’t seen a new coat of paint in years and service levels were poor			0
the core enterprise was suffering			0
so , can @entity171 ( from food and soap giant @entity172 ) turn things around ? he is part of a team that helped make the @entity179 - @entity178 group , whose interests range from @entity183 margarine to @entity185 soap , into a more manageable enterprise			1
but his background is not in retailing			0
while @entity7 chairman sir @entity189 said the appointment was designed to restore @entity7 ’s image as a ‘ consumer ’ brand , many of @entity29 ’s great high street retailers ( such as @entity194 , recently of @entity24 ’s , @entity195 of @entity196 and sir @entity197 of @entity198 ) will be rolling their eyes			2
indeed , @entity171 ’s appointment is being compared with @entity203 ’s move from an early career in manufacture ( with the brewer @entity206 ) to retailing as boss of @entity74			0
the transition was not easy at first , though there are now signs that he may finally be achieving some success			0
and there ’s no doubt that @entity7 can bounce back			0
i am convinced that @entity68 and @entity69 are not a major threat			0
discerning shoppers want choice , not loss - leaders such as the much bally - hooed £ 4 school uniform and a single bargain bottle of @entity222 when rivals such as @entity7 do an excellent and wide @entity231 ’s more , the queues at @entity69 and @entity68 are much too long , the car parks too small and the lack of choice – one kind of dark chocolate packaged to look like @entity229 – will drive the shopper to despair and boredom			1
it may well be that in recent times , @entity7 has been trying to do too much			0
however , it remains a trusted brand			0
the notion that somehow it is finished is a fantasy			0
a different touch on the tiller might be precisely what it needs – especially as some of the tough decisions already have been taken .			0
