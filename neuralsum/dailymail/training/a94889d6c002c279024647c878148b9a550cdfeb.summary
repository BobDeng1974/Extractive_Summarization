' the disappointing thing is that it 's something we fell into even though we knew it was there			0
' we warned the players about it and you think you 've covered it off , when maybe you have n't covered it off			2
maybe you have to say it every day			2
' the difficult thing is that it gets perceived as something that it was n't really			0
' but if enough people say it is something , then everyone believes that is what it was			0
you 're fighting a difficult battle			0
' i 'm not saying that things did n't happen , but i 'm saying the perception is that that was the only thing that happened			0
' that became the story rather than the rugby and that 's what gets remembered			0

' it was n't actually a true reflection of those people and what we were about , but you 're fighting a tidal wave almost at that point because everyone ' knows ' what 's happened because they 've read about it			0
' people start telling me what it was like when i was there ...			0
. that 's the battle you have to win			0

' @entity2 players watch on during a quarter - final defeat by @entity105 in @entity24 @entity162 and @entity163 battle for the ball in a pool b match @entity0 's record as @entity2 coach tests - 38 wins 21 draws 1 defeats 16 @entity171 title - 2011 @entity0 insists that the @entity5 - winning heroes of 2003 got up to similar things during that tournament in @entity175			1
however , because of the results on the pitch they were not taken to task			2
the former captain said : ' in 2003 once you 've won the @entity5 , everything is portrayed as being great and a perfect working machine			1
' but of course it was n't - we were all human beings , we all made mistakes , had our frailties and did similar things that the boys did in 2011			1
' it just did n't get to that level and did n't get recorded			0
and then you win , so everything is all right			0
' @entity22 was caught up in off - the - field controversy during the competition @entity0 and captain @entity196 chat during a training session in @entity198 @entity0 defended a managerial record that spanned 38 tests , numbering 21 wins , 16 defeats and one draw			1
