by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 06:04 est , 4 may 2012 court victory : @entity2 and his family spent four days trying to make it home from @entity5 when volcanic ash closed @entity8 ’s skies two years ago , @entity2 and his family were stranded halfway home from a holiday of a lifetime in @entity12			1
but unlike thousands facing similar nightmares , mr @entity2 just happens to be one of @entity16 ’s top barristers specialising in commercial litigation			0
the @entity18 has since won £ 10,000 from the airline forced to cancel his family ’s flight			2
he and his wife and three children had enjoyed a fortnight in @entity26 and a visit to the @entity28			1
they had flown back to @entity5 , where they were due to board a flight home to @entity32 , when all flights were cancelled as volcano @entity35 erupted in @entity36			2
at the airport , mr @entity2 , 46 , and his wife @entity37 , 47 , were told by an @entity40 worker that they were best off arranging their own way back to @entity32			1
holiday nightmares : the @entity2 family were stranded in @entity5 when ash from @entity36 's @entity35 volcano grounded planes and closed airports across @entity8 in april 2010 in fact , a flight became available the next day			2
but by then the unwitting @entity52 had begun their own exhausting four - day trip home			1
they hired a car and drove to @entity56 , where they spent a night , before driving to @entity58			0
the next day they caught a train to @entity61 , where they also overnighted , before boarding the @entity63 to @entity32			0
bad advice : the @entity52 ( not pictured ) were trapped like so many travellers across @entity8 , but were wrongly told by their airline to make their own way home			1
a judge said @entity40 failed to re-route them as soon as possible the @entity72 ‘ @entity71 ’ entitle passengers caught up in the ash chaos in april 2010 to refunds or alternative flights			1
@entity40 refunded in full the £ 1,075 cost of the @entity52 ’ cancelled flights to @entity32 , but refused to refund them the costs of their alternative journey home			1
judge @entity81 mr @entity2 represented himself as he fought the @entity83 airline through the courts to win back the cash spent on his family ’s overland odyssey across @entity8			1
at the @entity89 a district judge dismissed his claim on the grounds that , under the @entity72 rules , airlines do not have to compensate passengers in ‘ extraordinary circumstances ’			2
but mr @entity2 appealed and the judgment was overturned at the same court by judge @entity81 , who said the airline had breached its contract and air industry regulations in failing to re-route the family as soon as possible			1
@entity40 was ordered to pay about £ 8,000 for the @entity52 ’ cost of getting home , plus £ 2,000 damages for inconvenience			1
the airline then tried to challenge this at the @entity108 , without success			0
this week lord justice @entity112 said of the amount awarded : ‘ that may be a significant sum for @entity2 and mrs @entity115 , i do not know			0
i am certain it is absolutely insignificant to @entity40			2
’ out of pocket : passengers face disruption at @entity119			0
more than 150,000 @entity16 were stranded overseas , but most did not get compensation because the eruption was deemed ' extraordinary circumstances ' yesterday mr @entity2 said : ‘ it was quite clear to me these airlines want to intimidate people into not making a claim			0
there have been conflicting decisions in the county courts in previous cases as to whether or not you can claim compensation			0
i hope my case will assist others in showing you do have a right to seek compensation			0
’ he estimated the airline had spent ‘ easily £ 50,000 ’ contesting the case , which he described as ‘ crazy ’ .			0

@entity52 were trapped in @entity83 after holiday in the @entity28
airline breached regulations by not re-routing them as soon as possible , judge rules
@entity40 official wrongly advised them to arrange their own *transport* home
