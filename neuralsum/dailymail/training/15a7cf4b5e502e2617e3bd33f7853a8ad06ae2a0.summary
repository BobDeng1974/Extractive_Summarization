@entity6 also claimed to have completed 25 years in the @entity7 , but documentation suggested he had only completed 16 days before buying himself out without completing his basic training			1
he was employed as a ‘ meeter and greeter ’ at @entity12 , a 500 - year - old charity based in @entity14 which helps to care for mariners and their dependents			1
disgraceful : @entity6 , 60 , has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work while he was employed , he claimed he had testicular cancer and forged letters from an imaginary consultant to justify taking time off work for fictitious hospital appointments			1
the charity had sacked the 60 - year - old for nine counts of gross misconduct which included running - up up a ' considerable bill ' by calling a dating agency on the handyman ’s phone , the tribunal was told			1
but mr @entity6 claimed he had been unfairly dismissed when the breakdown of a relationship triggered an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder which his managers failed to deal with			2
but his case was withdrawn and the tribunal was shown paperwork stating the 60 - year - old served just 16 days in the @entity7 in 1979 without having completed his basic training			1
and in a rare move by the tribunal panel , mr @entity6 was ordered to pay £ 10,000 in costs after a second claim for disability discrimination was withdrawn in june this year			1
mr @entity6 was employed by @entity49 , pilots and @entity51 , where he worked as a ' meeter and greeter ' attending to vips and guests at the charity ’s functions			0
fantasist : @entity6 was employed as a ' meeter and greeter ' at a 500 - year - old charity but the organisation , which helps support poor mariners as well as examining and licensing deep sea shipping pilots , dismissed him in may last year after it was discovered that he had lied about suffering from cancer			1
mr @entity6 had used a work printer to write letters from medical experts in which he lied about suffering from testicular cancer , the tribunal was told			2
he lost his £ 8 - an - hour job after colleagues discovered the forged letter from fictitious consultant oncologist @entity78 , a character created by mr @entity6 to justify taking time off work to attend appointments , it was said			1
in february mr @entity6 - who has spoken publicly about his battle to deal with the demons of war - launched a damages claim for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination			0
but a legal team from @entity90 , led by senior associate @entity91 , refuted the claims and in april they produced a letter from the @entity7 which said mr @entity6 enlisted on march 21 , 1972 , but bought himself out just 16 days later on april 6			2
it is unclear if mr @entity6 subsequently served in other parts of the armed forces or whether he saw action on foreign soil			0
it is believed that he was a member of the @entity100 at some point			0
but mr @entity91 produced evidence at the tribunal which suggested mr @entity6 had been working in @entity104 as a caretaker during the 1990s when he claimed to be a serving aircraftsman			0
a spokeswoman for @entity12 said : ' the @entity14 @entity12 is pleased with the outcome of this employment tribunal which makes clear that all mr @entity6 ’s claims were completely untrue			0
' we are , however , both deeply shocked and saddened that mr @entity6 invented a past history with the @entity7 and moreover that he chose to fabricate post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of combat experience			0
' we feel such deception is not only disturbing but also demeaning to all those genuine victims from our armed forces			0
' mr @entity6 refused to comment following the tribunal but in a claim submitted to the tribunal , mr @entity6 said : ' i was dismissed from my employment for alleged gross misconduct			2
' at that time and presently i was / am suffering severe depression , also severe ptsd causing me to suffer loss of intellectual and social functions , whilst striving to hold down full - time employment			0
