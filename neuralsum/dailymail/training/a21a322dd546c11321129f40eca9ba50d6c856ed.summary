by @entity0 tax dodgers who refuse to cough up could have their bank accounts raided by @entity4 after stronger powers were handed to the taxman			1
a raft of radical measures unveiled by @entity9 is expected to rake in an additional £ 4bn for @entity4			1
this is part of a wider international effort to clamp down on individuals and companies that avoid tax , with @entity15 vowing to lead the way			2
the chancellor declared : ‘ the public tolerance for those who do not pay their fair share evaporated long ago – but we ’ve had to wait for this government before there was proper action			1
' anyone owing more than £ 1,000 in tax or tax credits could see their bank account raided if they have been contacted several times and are able to pay			2
at least £ 5,000 would be left in an account , the chancellor said , as he ramped up @entity4 ’s debt collection powers			1
the move brings @entity15 into line with @entity36 and the @entity37 , which both have similar systems			0
companies that shift profits overseas by borrowing from divisions based in offshore tax havens will also be hammered by the changes			2
mr @entity9 said he ‘ will block transfers of profits between companies within groups to avoid tax ’			1
the heavily criticised technique has been used by a host of overseas firms such as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 to reduce @entity15 tax bills			2
chancellor @entity9 said public tolerance for those who do not pay their fair share evaporated long ago but critics said the move could hit some large international companies not trying to avoid tax			1
@entity64 , partner at @entity66 law firm , said : ‘ this draft legislation is drafted extremely broadly , meaning any profit transfer between two companies in a group that incurs any tax advantage at all will potentially be subject to @entity15 tax , even if it has already been taxed overseas			0
’ the number of registered tax avoidance schemes has halved , while the amount collected by @entity76 through compliance has doubled , @entity9 said			1
now anyone found to be using personal tax avoidance schemes queried by @entity4 must pay back the disputed sum immediately – and will only be reimbursed if the scheme is found to be legal			1
previously tax avoiders only had to pay up if their case was struck down by the courts			0
‘ if people feel they ’ve been wronged , they can of course go to court , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ if they win , they get their money back with interest			0
’ tax experts said the move would deter the wealthy from entering into such schemes			0
@entity97 , head of tax policy at @entity99 , said : ‘ it will reduce the individuals doing these schemes because if you do n’t get an immediate cash benefit there ’s nowhere near so many people who will do a scheme			0
’ the new rules will apply retrospectively , meaning investors who participated in the schemes in the past – which could stretch back as far as 2004 – and are involved in a dispute with the authorities are likely to be asked to pay their bill come july			0
the chancellor also pledged to stop people – often foreign nationals – avoiding stamp duty by owning homes through a company			0
from midnight anyone buying a home worth £ 500,000 or more through a company must now pay 15 per cent stamp duty .			0
