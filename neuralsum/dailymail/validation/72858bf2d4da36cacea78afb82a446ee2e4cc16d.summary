@entity2 peer @entity0 , who last year took home £ 4.6million , said the living wage was ' irrelevant ' the multi-millionaire boss of @entity6 sparked anger last night after declaring that the living wage was ‘ irrelevant ’			1
@entity2 peer @entity0 , who last year took home £ 4.6million , said it was ‘ an invention ’ and ‘ not a reality ’			1
the living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living in the @entity15 and is £ 7.85 an hour and £ 9.15 in @entity16			1
it has become a cause celebre with trade unions and some politicians - including @entity22 leader @entity21 and @entity16 mayor @entity23			2
@entity0 earns a basic salary of £ 729,000 which works out at £ 233 an hour assuming he works 12 hours a day and excludes weekends			1
he believes the living wage is irrelevant because it depends on how many hours staff work as to what they earn and whether they can live on it			1
he said : ‘ i think retail wages are a living wage for a lot of people but not for everybody			1
' what is a living wage will depend on the circumstances of the person earning it more than the amount being paid			1
‘ what is a living wage for a student living at home is very different to a living wage to someone who is supporting family			2
‘ i think there are a lot of people for whom £ 6.70 an hour is a wage they can live on but it ’s not a wage everyone can raise a family on			1
’ ‘ you have got to remember in retail the vast majority of jobs are part time so the amount you are earning per hour is irrelevant really , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s the amount you earn in total that will determine whether you can live on it or not			0
‘ @entity0 made the comment on the same day @entity6 posted bumper annual figures the next chief executive employs 48,417 full and part time staff earning an average £ 11,000 annual salary			1

@entity77 from the @entity78 described @entity0 ’s comments as ‘ crass ’			0
he said : ‘ the living wage is calculated by independent experts looking at a wide range of evidence			2
@entity22 mp @entity84 ( pictured ) said the comments were ‘ ill - judged ' ‘ they are probably better judges of its relevance than @entity0 - and with estimated wealth of more than £ 100 million , it does feel a bit crass for him to be passing comment on whether people can get by on less than £ 7.85 an hour			1
’ @entity22 mp @entity84 , a member of the influential business committee , said the comments were ‘ ill - judged coming from someone who is fortunate enough to have such a good income ’			0
she said next staff ‘ live a very different life from the cushy life that he enjoys in his private life ’			0
she added that it would be ‘ a reality check ’ for @entity0 ‘ to try and live on that wage for a prolonged period ’			2
she added : ‘ it ’s just not taking his staff seriously			0
‘ he is entitled to his political views , but at the end of the day any employer who is not prepared to engage in this debate is doing their staff down			0
