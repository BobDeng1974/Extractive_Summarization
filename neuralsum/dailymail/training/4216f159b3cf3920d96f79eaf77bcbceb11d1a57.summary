celebrity : @entity1 became a household name in 1993 when his wife @entity3 cut off his penis			1
his celebrity status has resulted in him sleeping with around 70 women since @entity1 suffered what was , to most men , the worst possible attack - having his penis sliced clean off			1
his prospects of surviving , let alone experiencing the joys of a fully - functioning manhood , looked incredibly bleak as he lost consciousness and began to lose vast quantities of blood			2
but shocking doctors and all who have followed the now infamous case , mr @entity1 , 46 , went on to make a full recovery , has since slept with around 70 women - even worked as a porn star - and is now a devout @entity22 and hoping to marry for the third time			1
while he would not wish his horrific ordeal - which still gives him nightmares 20 years after it happened - upon anybody , mr @entity1 can not deny it has transformed his life			1
speaking to @entity28 , he said : ' the doctors told me i would never be able to have sex again because my injuries were so bad			0
but i 've proved them wrong time and time again			0
i believe i 've slept with 70 women since the incident			1
' he added : ' being the most famous man to have his penis chopped off does have its advantages			0
it definitely has not hurt my love life - in fact it improved it			0
' it all began two decades ago , on june 23 , 1993 - a terrifying moment that will remain sealed in mr @entity1 's memories forever			1
he had been out drinking with friends in @entity47 and came home to his then - wife @entity3			2
a court later heard that she claimed he tried to rape her , but mr @entity1 was acquitted of this			2
after he fell asleep , @entity3 went out to the kitchen and chose her weapon - an eight - inch knife			0
she then returned to the bedroom and sliced off his penis			0
in a rage , she jumped in the car and drove off , throwing the severed end out of the window			0
to this day , mr @entity1 still remembers the shuddering pain ; he still dreams of the moment the cold knife carved through his penis until the last two - and - a - half inches were completely severed			1
reunited : mr @entity1 was reunited with his former wife @entity3 on @entity69 tabloid show insider in 2009			1
on the show he said he was hurt by the fact she never apologised the former @entity73 recalls seeing torrents of blood gush from his groin before losing consciousness			0
he next woke momentarily in hospital , about to enter surgery			0
fortunately , realising her error , @entity3 had called the emergency services and a painstaking search had found his penis in a field			1
doctors worked for 10 hours re-joining his detached penis , carefully stitching together multiple nerve endings to give him the best possible chance of regaining some feeling			2
after the operation , they told him he would never be able to have sex again			0
he had a catheter for two months and it took two years for his penis to fully heal , but incredibly , it was only three weeks after the op that he began to feel a tingling sensation in his re-attached penis			2
he was so excited by it , he called his mother			0
it would be just three months after the surgery that mr @entity1 first had sex again , after meeting a girl in a bar			1
frightened he would n't be able to perform , mr @entity1 was relieved to discover he was still capable of having sex ; it ' was n't 100 per cent , but we did ok , ' he said			1
it did n't take long before mr @entity1 was making the most of his miracle penis , and became a global celebrity as a result			1
he appeared in various news media and radio shows , talking about his experience			0
three years ago mr @entity1 appeared on @entity116 to talk about his life 17 years on			2
he told the all - female panel that it was still hard to trust women one radio show even offered to pay for him to undergo penis enlargement surgery , which mr @entity1 says he jumped at			1
the second three - hour op added an extra two inches to the length and made it thicker			1
bursting with confidence , mr @entity1 went on to form a band called @entity128 , moved to @entity129 and starred in a number of adult sex films , including one called @entity1			1
his celebrity lifestyle caught up with him however and he spiralled onto a dark path			0
in 1994 mr @entity1 was jailed for 15 days for assaulting his then - fiance @entity134			1
trial : mr @entity1 's former wife @entity3 , pictured during the 1993 trial			2
years later mr @entity1 said she had clearly done it because she was ' heartbroken ' he went on to marry two other women - a businesswoman in 2001 to whom he was wed for just 23 days ; and a woman in 2002 who he was also accused of assaulting			1
this marriage ended after two years			0
today , mr @entity1 insists his wayward life is all behind him ; he has returned to his home town of @entity147 in @entity148 ; is a regular church - goer ; makes a living as a carpenter and limo - driver and has finally found love			1
@entity154 , 43 , is a childhood friend ; the two are planning to get hitched soon			0
he is also in the process of researching and writing a book on men who have suffered the same kind of attack			0
he says since 1836 until his case in 1993 , he has found 19 documented cases of similar penis - severing attacks			2
since his case , however , there have been 121 others - many of which have been copycat cases			0
but perhaps not all have had such fortunate outcomes			0
mr @entity1 told @entity28 : ' obviously i would have preferred not to go through all that pain and suffering			2
but being famous for my penis has given me opportunities i could not have ever imagined			0

@entity1 , 46 , thought he would never be able to have sex again
underwent 10 - hour op to re-attach his severed penis which was found thrown in a field
he has since slept with 70 women , starred in porn films , plans to marry his third wife
says his violent days are behind him as he has now found @entity188
