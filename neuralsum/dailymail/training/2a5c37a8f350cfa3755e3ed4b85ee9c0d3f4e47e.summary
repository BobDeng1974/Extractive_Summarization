the @entity1 's chief economist has said interest rates are likely to remain ‘ lower for longer ’ as the ‘ jobs - rich and pay - poor ’ recovery from the @entity5 slows			1
@entity6 said he was concerned about the outlook for the economy because of weaker global growth , low pay rises and political and financial risks			2
but his comments were in contrast to the @entity1 's self - confessed rebel @entity14 who has voted against the majority to increase increase rates			1
@entity1 chief economist @entity6 said : ' put in rather plainer @entity17 , i am gloomier ' mr @entity6 told business leaders during a speech in @entity21 , @entity22 : ‘ put in rather plainer @entity17 , i am gloomier			1
‘ interest rates could remain lower for longer , certainly than i had expected three months ago			1
’ then , mr @entity6 had said the @entity1 should ‘ play off the front foot ’ and raise rates sooner rather than later			1
‘ the statistics now appear to favour the back foot , ’ he said yesterday			0
‘ that was three months ago , the weather was warm … the weather ’s got cooler			0
’ he suggested rates will stay static until after the @entity33 in may			2
‘ who knows precisely when the lift - off date will come , ’ he added			0
he said the economy is ‘ writhing in both agony and ecstasy ’ as increases in output and employment are offset by weak wage growth and productivity			0
‘ this has been a jobs - rich but pay - poor recovery , ’ he said			0
rates have not risen since july 2007 and have been at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 , in a boost to millions of borrowers who have enjoyed record low mortgage costs			1
however , the prolonged period of ultra-low rates has hammered savers who have been forced to accept paltry returns			0
trade - off : the low rates have benefited those with mortgages - but those with savings have taken the hit the stronger - than - expected recovery over the last 18 months and sharp falls in unemployment , which at 6 per cent is now at its lowest level for nearly six years , sparked speculation that rates could rise before the end of this year or early next year			2
but the deepening crisis in the @entity69 and worries about the global economy are now seen as a threat to the @entity73 – prompting analysts and investors to push their expectations of when rates will rise back to after the election			2
official figures this week showed inflation fell to 1.2 per cent in september – its lowest level for five years and well below the 2 per cent target – giving the @entity1 leeway to leave rates low for longer			2
two members of the nine - strong monetary policy committee that sets rates have already started calling for an increase but they have been outvoted by the other seven			0
self - confessed rebel @entity14 , the @entity1 policymaker , has voted for the past two months to raise interest rates and believes now is the time to tighten monetary policy @entity1 @entity89 ( @entity89 ) member @entity14 argues that it is not the current rate we should be concerned about , but what 's in store for prices in two to three years ' time			1
he pointed out that two of the big factors behind the recent decline - falling oil prices and the strong pound - are driven by forces beyond the @entity1 's control			0
mr @entity14 said the @entity89 needs to do more work on assessing the impact of the strong pound in the first half of the year , which is estimated to have pushed down the headline inflation rate by 0.5 percentage points			1
he says divergent monetary policies in the @entity73 , @entity110 and eurozone will also play a role			0
he maintains that waiting too long to raise rates increases the risk that they will have to go up more sharply to keep a lid on inflation			1
he told the @entity119 : ' as far as i can see , if i were to wait until all the downside risks went away , then i think i could be confident that i 'd waited for too long			0
' dr @entity121 , chief @entity73 and @entity123 economist at @entity124 , said : ‘ we have put back our expectation of the first interest rate hike from february to mid- 2015			2
‘ with earnings growth currently still weak , inflation down and likely to go lower still in the near term , and with global growth concerns particularly the weakness in the eurozone posing an increased downside risk to the @entity73 growth outlook , we suspect that the majority of @entity89 members will prefer to err on the side of caution in raising interest rates			1
’ he said he expects rates to rise to 1 per cent by the end of 2015 , to 2 per cent by the end of 2016 and to 3 per cent by the end of 2017 .			0

chief economist @entity6 changed tack from comments in *summer*

rates static since july 2007 and have been at 0.5 *%* since march 2009
