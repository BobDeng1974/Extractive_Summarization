there are between 20 and 30 cars that make up the official motorcade of the @entity3 - a security procession that travels , usually at high speeds and with green - light corridors , with the commander - in - chief everywhere he goes			1
a 24 - year - old @entity10 student has now revealed how she was selected as one of many volunteer drivers to be part of that chain of vehicles , ' following @entity16 all over @entity17 ' for a day - despite having no experience , no training and , in what experts have called the most troubling , no idea what to do in an emergency			1
@entity25 even read a college textbook while waiting for the convoy to get back on the road , and posted pictures to her @entity30 of the october experience , one of which was captioned : ' me , wondering why anyone would trust me with a 15 - passenger van full of reporters			1
' ' me with the president 's car ' : @entity40 student @entity25 spent a day as part of the president 's motorcade in @entity17 , but admits to having no experience or training snap happy : @entity46 , a graduate student , volunteered for the job after being offered it by a friend , and documented the experience with a series of photos on @entity30 , such as this one @entity53 : this photo was captioned with ' me , wondering why anyone would trust me with a 15 - passenger van full of reporters ' ' you know how sometimes you are starting a new job or starting a new course , and you have to come up with three truths and a lie about yourself ? ” @entity46 told the @entity64 in a new feature			1
' this will be my truth that sounds like a lie			0
' the motorcade is centrally comprised of a @entity71 detail guarding the president , local police as assistance and an ambulance - which remains at the rear with a doctor permanently on board			1
however , there are also ' filler ' cars in the middle carrying @entity89 personnel , communications staff and reporters , all of whom travel with the president			1
@entity46 said that one week before president @entity16 arrived in @entity17 on october 10 , a friend who works at the @entity89 texted her asking if she would be willing to drive a van full of reporters as part of the procession			1
she told him she had never driven a van , but had driven a pick - up truck			2
she also said she had a clean driving record , no criminal history and would be willing to take on the job			0
a week later she was on the tarmac at @entity102 waiting for @entity103 to touch down			0
touch down : president @entity16 arrives at @entity102 on friday october 10 , 2014 , to attend fundraising events when pressed by @entity105 on how she would handle an incident such as an attack , @entity46 admitted she received little - to - no briefing from the @entity71 before getting behind the wheel of the official van			1
she said the main warning was not to hit any police motorcycles , usually driven by local officers			1
@entity46 also said that , in the event of an emergency , she would just follow the car in front of her			0
' whatever i am is good enough for them , ' @entity46 told the newspaper			0
in practice , the president travels in a line of vehicles that is referred to as the ' secure package '			2
@entity71 agents are trained to pull the secure package out of the motorcade during an emergency			1
they would separate from the group and get the president to safety , leaving the other cars behind			2
however , having a novice involved in any part of the motorcade poses serious security issues , according to former @entity71 agent @entity140			1
agents of ( blue ) steel : here @entity46 poses with two @entity71 agents , who she described as friendly escort : this photo was captioned with ' @entity147 through the empty streets			1
people waved and took my picture but i do n't think they realized that i 'm just me ' ' drove out onto the tarmac at @entity102 to greet @entity103 , ' @entity46 wrote with this photo @entity140 , author of within @entity155 ’s length : a @entity157 ’s @entity156 of protecting the president , served as agent between 1983 and 2004			2
' if the motorcade ever comes under fire , it ’s going to be a problem , ' he told @entity105			0
' there are so many non-law - enforcement vehicles that it ’s going to be a goat rope			0
' everyone will be responding , police officers and the @entity71 , and it will be all these people running around in a panic like the last scene of the ‘ @entity178 ’ movie , when there ’s the big police chase that ends in a wreck of 50 police cars			1
' @entity140 said he used to work as part of the motorcade and the cars being driven by volunteers - something that has been commonplace since the 1980s - were often more problematic than the risk of a skirmish			1
' you are face to face with a young person who is just completely full of themselves and enthralled , ' @entity140 said			0
' we were more concerned with that than an attack on the motorcade			0
' ' @entity194 thing they told us was not to hit any motorcycle cops			0
i mean , among other things , ' @entity46 posted @entity46 said she remained committed to her driving and the motorcade throughout the entire day			1
but between official visits and press conferences , there was plenty of time to take photos and read her textbook			0
