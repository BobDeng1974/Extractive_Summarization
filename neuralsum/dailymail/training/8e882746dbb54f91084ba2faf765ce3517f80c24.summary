in an eccentric performance in front of 2,500 fans in @entity16 , @entity0 said : ' i know that i have made a certain @entity2 very angry with me			1
it 's not my intention to make enemies			1
' backtracking : the pop star , pictured yesterday in @entity16 , issued what appeared to be an apology to the @entity3 nationalist leader @entity0 then went on to praise @entity3 for its tolerance and the welcome it had shown to black performers			1
she said : ' before the civil rights movement in @entity31 , @entity29 artists were not allowed to perform in @entity31 , but @entity3 opened its arms to @entity33 , @entity34 , to people of colour and people who were different			2
minorities felt welcome in @entity3			0
' if we do n't learn from history we will just repeat it			0
so the next time you want to point the finger at somebody and blame them for the problems in your life take that finger and point it back at you			0
' despite her emotive words , there were boos when @entity0 , who turns 54 in august , performed for just 45 minutes , after fans paid up to £ 200 to see her			1
music to their ears : the 54 - year - old announced that she ' did not want to make enemies ' with a ' very angry ' @entity2 , right , and praised @entity3 for its tolerance and welcome it has shown to black performers she also raised eyebrows when she said : ' i have a special affinity with @entity3 , and i have for many years			1
it could go all the way to @entity65 because i think of myself as a revolutionary			0
' the pop queen was attacked for only singing for around 30 minutes - and spending 15 minutes ' wittering on about politics '			2
as she left the stage , the curtains closed behind her with a message reading ' i love you '			0
but when she did not reappear for an encore , audience members began jeering , booing and pelting the stage with bottles			0
an image displayed by @entity0 at a @entity16 concert earlier this month showed ms @entity79 , 43 , with the @entity81 symbol super-imposed over her face ticket prices for the sold - out gig started at £ 60 rising to £ 200 , but were exchanging hands on the black market for up to £ 1,000			1
concert - goer @entity87 said afterwards : ' the show was ok but it only last 45 minutes , and she spent 15 minutes of that wittering on about politics and tolerance			0
' we did n't come to hear that			0
it was a concert , not the @entity97			0

high glamour : the @entity9 said the 54 - year - old singer had displayed the provocative image in an effort to get people talking about her ' @entity2 will defend not only her own honour but her supporters and the millions of @entity9 voters			1
' ms @entity79 , 43 , threatened prosecution when @entity0 performed the same stunt in @entity121 , saying : ' we understand how old singers who need to get people talking about them go to such extremes			2
' other sources in the @entity9 , which has frequently been linked with anti-semitism and racism , said @entity0 had offended all of its members			1
' we are not a @entity81 party , and object to being depicted as such , ' said a source in the party , which won a fifth of the popular vote during the first round of presidential elections in april			0
' if you accuse the @entity9 of being anti-semitic and racist then you accuse a fifth of the @entity3 people of being anti-semitic and racist			2
' @entity2 pledged to reform the party after taking over the leadership from her notorious father , @entity145 last year			2
