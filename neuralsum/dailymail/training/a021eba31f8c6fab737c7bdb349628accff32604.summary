some family doctors are already being paid £ 200 to diagnose dementia - more than four times the amount to be offered under a controversial new government proposal			1
@entity4 get the extra money if they identify patients with the condition and then implement a care plan to help them			2
the £ 200 payments - made to doctors in @entity11 - were already in place months before wednesday 's pledge by ministers to dramatically improve rates of dementia diagnosis			1
gps in @entity11 are already being paid £ 200 to diagnose patients with dementia and develop a care plan - four times as much as the government 's £ 55 ' cash for diagnosis ' scheme which was announced on wednesday @entity27 @entity26 ( @entity28 ) , which runs gp practices in the area , has offered gps a £ 200 ' bonus ' payment if they increase their diagnosis rates by 5 per cent , or if they reach a target of 65 per cent of dementia diagnosis expected in the area			1
this is on top of rewarding practices with £ 500 for signing up to a voluntary scheme brought in last year which required @entity4 to screen at - risk patients for dementia			1
48 out of 55 gp practices in @entity11 opted into the local scheme			1
defending the payment , @entity27 @entity28 told @entity47 magazine the bonus was set up to support family doctors taking on dementia care from specialists			2
the payments are also so @entity4 have extra resources to diagnose patients and review their care , it added			1
the news comes after ministers announced on wednesday that @entity4 would be paid £ 55 for every patient they diagnose with dementia under a controversial new scheme			1
it is being rolled out by the @entity27 due to concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases			1
around 850,000 patients in @entity67 are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis			2
this has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done			2
doctors already get extra money for performing a host of medical checks on such as blood pressure , cholesterol and diabetes			0
the @entity83 said the government 's proposal to pay gps for diagnosing dementia is a ' step too far ' and will mean ' rewarding poor @entity4 ' but the new payments for diagnosing dementia have been heavily criticised by the @entity83 who said it was ' rewarding poor @entity4 '			1
@entity92 , chief executive of the @entity93 , said : ' we know gps receive incentive payments to find all sorts of conditions , such as high cholesterol , raised blood pressure and diabetes - but this seems a step too far			1
' it is putting a bounty on the head of certain patients			0
' @entity4 will be diagnosing their dementia patients already			2
this seems to be rewarding poor gps			1
it is a distortion of good medical practice			0
' there is an issue of people presenting late with dementia to doctors , but this is not the right way to go about tackling that			0
' if people were given hope that something could be done , that would be the greatest incentive for coming early			0
' the @entity124 also spoke out against incentivising @entity4 to make certain diagnoses			2
around 850,000 patients in @entity67 are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis ( file picture ) campaign manager @entity130 said : ' are n't @entity4 already paid to diagnose diseases and illnesses via their wages ? ' it seems bizarre that you would hand out extra payments to @entity4 just because the patient walking through the door has dementia rather than a sore throat			1
' spotting dementia is a worthy goal , but we 'd expect @entity4 to do it as part of the job they 're already compensated for			2
' there are also obvious , inherent risks to encouraging certain diagnoses over others			0
' but the criticism was dismissed as unfair by doctors who claim it will help , not hinder , diagnosis			0
dr @entity154 , a gp in @entity156 and part of the @entity159 support team for dementia , said : ' what we are recognising is that general practitioners are in an ideal position to provide quality care to our patients with dementia and which is a new type of care that we have n't provided in the past			0
' therefore it is entirely appropriate that that care has investment attached to it			0
' the scheme encourages @entity4 to increase their understanding and awareness of dementia and local services , he said			1
it will teach them how to pursue a diagnosis , support patients through that process and how to help them after they 've been diagnosed , he added			0
he said : ' we need to look at this in the bigger picture , we do n't have that many people who have a deep a profound understanding of the politics behind dementia care			0
' not many people understand the pressure at the moment for us to increase diagnosis rates , which is political pressure , not from good medical practice			0
' if we had all that out in the open people could judge for themselves			0
' the national scheme is understood to be the first country - wide initiative to offer doctors financial rewards for diagnosing patients with any condition .			0

ministers this week announced scheme to pay gps £ 55 per diagnosis
rolled out over concerns that @entity4 pick up less than half of all cases
but some gps already being paid £ 200 to diagnose dementia , it has emerged
48 practices in @entity11 opted into the local scheme offering the £ 200 bonus
new ' cash for diagnosis ' scheme was *slammed* by @entity93
said it is a ' step too far ' and it was ' rewarding poor @entity4 '
