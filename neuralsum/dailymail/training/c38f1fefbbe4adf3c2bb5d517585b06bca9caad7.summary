because of their size , the arms will only last @entity4 until he is three			2
he will have to get new arms every few years until he is a fully grown man			2

' so why not give him the tools available so that as he grows up , that 's what he knows			0
' scientists believe that by the time @entity4 is an adult , he wo n't need to operate the prosthetic s with his muscles			2
that is because he will be able to use his brain			0
@entity4 's parents , @entity120 and @entity100 , moved to @entity14 so they could give their son the treatment he needs and are happy with the results so far doctors still do n't know why @entity4 's arms stopped growing in the womb			1
