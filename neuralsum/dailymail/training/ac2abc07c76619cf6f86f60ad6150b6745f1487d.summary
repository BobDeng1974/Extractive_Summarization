by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 @entity2 have decided to play ball and participate in a special committee charged with investigating the @entity8 administration 's handling of a 2012 terror attack in @entity10 , @entity11 that left four @entity1 dead and forced the withdrawal of @entity1 diplomats from the eastern port city			1
@entity3 minority leader @entity15 named five democrats to the panel : @entity18 of @entity19 , @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity24 of @entity23 and @entity25 of @entity26			1
some in the @entity2 caucus had floated the idea of boycotting the committee and leaving republicans to pursue the @entity10 investigation , opening the opportunity to paint the investigation as a partisan political stunt in an election year			2
play ball ! : @entity15 rep. @entity15 appointed five @entity2 to serve on a @entity30 - led @entity37 charged with investigating the 2012 @entity10 terror attack the military - style incursion directed by @entity41 terror group @entity40 against @entity1 diplomatic facilities left the @entity1 ambassador to @entity11 and three other @entity1 dead they initially demanded equal representation on the committee , but the @entity30 majority stuck with tradition and divided the seats 7 to 5			1
two weeks ago another scenario emerged that would have seen a single @entity50 participating so that liberals could keep tabs on its activities without appearing to approve of its mission			0
the special @entity37 will gather more than a half - dozen separate committees ' investigations into the @entity10 attack under one roof , taking over principally from the @entity61 committees			1
@entity18 , the senior @entity50 on the panel , is also the ranking minority member of the oversight committee			1
he has crossed swords with @entity30 chairman @entity69 , a @entity23 firebrand , over the significance of documents , the breadth of subpoenas , and the notable saga of former @entity74 official @entity73 , whose contempt of @entity67 vote a group of @entity69 - led @entity30 pushed to the @entity3 floor , where it succeeded			2
in addition to having broad subpoena powers and license to grill hearing witnesses that would usually fall under a range of committees ' separate jurisdictions , members of the new committee will be allowed to interrogate them at length instead of sticking to a traditional five - minute limit per questioner			0
house speaker @entity93 has tapped @entity95 rep. @entity94 to chair the committee			1
he will be joined by fellow republicans @entity98 of @entity99 , @entity100 of @entity101 , @entity102 of @entity103 , @entity104 of @entity105 , @entity106 of @entity26 and @entity107 of @entity108			0
mr. chairman : @entity95 rep. @entity94 , a former prosecutor , will chair the @entity37 the outspoken and sometimes cantankerous @entity19 @entity2 rep. @entity18 will counter @entity94 as the ranking member of the @entity3 minority on the panel they are charged with finding out what the @entity114 and @entity115 could have done to save lives – yet did n't – and what the @entity3 may have done to cover up an incompetent security system that denied the @entity10 compound extra muscle when @entity123 - affiliated militants began threatening to attack			1
no one has been arrested or charged with a crime in connection with the september 11 , 2012 military incursion at an @entity1 diplomatic outpost and a nearby @entity130 annex , carried out by @entity40 , an @entity123 affiliate			1
during a weekend fundraiser , president @entity8 called @entity30 ' focus on @entity10 and his @entity134 insurance overhaul law ' not serious			2
' he previously referred to @entity10 and other crises in his administration as ' phony scandals			0
' the outcome of the @entity37 's work could impact the 2016 election : @entity141 , who was secretary of state during the attack , is likely to run for president			0
her conduct before and after the 2012 calamity is in question			0
initially , she and @entity8 both shied away from conceding that @entity41 terrorists had attacked @entity1 in @entity10 , instead blaming the massacre on a spontaneous protest in reaction to a crude @entity1 - made @entity152 video that lampooned the @entity154 prophet @entity153			2
the intelligence community , it later emerged , never reported that conclusion on the ground			0
and the @entity3 knew almost instantly who was lobbing fixed mortars and grenades into the compound .			0

@entity3 @entity2 will have five seats on the new @entity37 , to the @entity30 ' seven
the panel is charged with finding out what happened before , during and after the september 11 , 2012 military - style attack on @entity1 diplomatic compounds in @entity10 , @entity11
@entity95 @entity30 @entity94 , a hard - nosed former prosecutor , will chair the committee
the ranking @entity50 will be @entity19 rep. @entity18 , who has been a thorn in the side of the @entity30 as the @entity176 investigated @entity10 on its own
