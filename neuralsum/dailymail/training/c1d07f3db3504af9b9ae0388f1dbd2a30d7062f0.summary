by @entity1 reporter published : 23:50 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 23:50 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 said it sent warplanes into its newly declared maritime air defense zone days after the @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 all sent flights through the airspace in defiance of rules @entity12 says it has imposed in the @entity13			1
@entity2 's air force on thursday sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft on normal air patrols in the zone , the @entity20 agency reported , citing air force spokesman @entity21			2
the report did not specify exactly when the flights were sent or whether they had encountered foreign aircraft			0
the @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity6 have said they have sent flights through the zone without encountering any @entity2 response since @entity12 announced the creation of the zone last week			1
enforcers : @entity2 has said it will now enforce rules it applied to the maritime defense zone over the @entity13 @entity21 described thursday 's flights as ' a defensive measure and in line with international common practices			1
' he said @entity2 's air force would remain on high alert and will take measures to protect the country 's airspace			1
while @entity2 's surprise announcement last week to create the zone initially raised some tensions in the region , analysts say @entity12 's motive is not to trigger an aerial confrontation but is a more long - term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own			1
@entity2 's lack of efforts to stop the foreign flights - including two @entity5 b - 52s that flew through the zone on tuesday - has been an embarrassment for @entity12			1
even some @entity2 state media outlets suggested thursday that @entity12 may have mishandled the episodes			0
' @entity12 needs to reform its information release mechanism to win the psychological battles waged by @entity68 and @entity69 , ' the @entity62 , a nationalist tabloid published by the @entity65 's flagship @entity63 , said in an editorial			0
without prior notice , @entity12 began demanding saturday that passing aircraft identify themselves and accept @entity2 instructions or face consequences in an @entity13 zone that overlaps a similar air defense identification zone overseen by @entity7 since 1969 and initially part of one set up by the @entity5 military			1
but when tested just days later by @entity5 b - 52 flights - with @entity68 saying it made no effort to comply with @entity2 's rules , and would not do so in the future - @entity12 merely noted , belatedly , that it had seen the flights and taken no further action			1
@entity6 's military said thursday its planes flew through the zone this week without informing @entity2 and with no apparent interference			1
@entity7 also said its planes have been continuing to fly through it after the @entity2 announcement , while the @entity92 , locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with @entity12 over @entity95 islands , said it also was rejecting @entity2 's declaration			1
no response : the @entity98 @entity68 took part in a joint military naval drill with @entity7 on thursday in waters off southern @entity7 , saying the event took place in the general vicinity of the new airspace defense zone which @entity2 established last week analysts question @entity2 's technical ability to enforce the zone due to a shortage of early warning radar aircraft and in - flight refueling capability			1
however , many believe that @entity2 has a long - term plan to win recognition for the zone with a gradual ratcheting - up of warnings and possibly also eventual enforcement action			1
' with regard to activity within the zone , nothing will happen - for a while , ' said june @entity124 , a @entity2 expert at the @entity125			2
' then the zone will become gradually enforced more strictly			0
the @entity7 will continue to protest , but not much more , to challenge it			0
' that may wear down @entity7 and effectively change the status quo , she said			0
the zone is seen primarily as @entity2 's latest bid to bolster its claim over a string of uninhabited @entity7 - controlled islands in the @entity13 - known as @entity136 in @entity7 and @entity136 in @entity2			1
@entity12 has been ratcheting up its sovereignty claims since @entity69 's nationalization of the islands last year			0
but the most immediate spark for the zone likely was @entity7 's threat last month to shoot down drones that @entity2 says it will send to the islands for mapping expeditions , said @entity146 , an @entity147 analyst at think tank @entity149 's @entity148 and a former @entity151 attache in @entity12			1
the zone comes an awkward time			0
although @entity12 's ties with @entity69 are at rock bottom , it was building good will and mutual trust with @entity68 following a pair of successful meetings between president @entity161 and @entity2 president @entity162			0
however , the zone feud now threatens to overshadow both the visit by vice president @entity165 to @entity12 next week and one by @entity167 foreign minister @entity166 expected before the end of the year			0
@entity2 's defense and foreign ministries offered no additional clarification thursday as to why @entity12 failed to respond to the @entity173 flights			0
@entity175 partners the @entity5 and @entity7 together have hundreds of military aircraft in the immediate vicinity			2
demands : @entity2 issued a list of requirements for all foreign aircraft passing through the area and said its armed forces would adopt ' defensive emergency measures ' against aircraft that do n't comply @entity2 on saturday issued a list of requirements for all foreign aircraft passing through the area , regardless of whether they were headed into @entity2 airspace , and said its armed forces would adopt ' defensive emergency measures ' against aircraft that do n't comply			2
@entity12 said the notifications are needed to help maintain air safety in the zone			0
however , the fact that @entity2 said it had identified and monitored the two @entity5 bombers during their tuesday flight seems to discredit that justification for the zone , said @entity198 , director of the international security program at @entity167 's @entity200 ' this suggests the zone is principally a political move , ' @entity198 said			1
' it signals a kind of creeping extension of authority			0
' along with concerns about confrontations or accidents involving @entity2 fighters and foreign aircraft , the zone 's establishment fuels fears of further aggressive moves to assert @entity2 's territorial claims - especially in the hotly disputed @entity95 , which @entity12 says belongs entirely to it			2
@entity217 spokesman @entity216 confirmed those concerns on saturday by saying @entity2 would establish additional air defense identification zones ' at an appropriate time			0
' for now , however , @entity2 's regional strategy is focused mostly on @entity7 and the island dispute , according to government - backed @entity2 scholars			2
@entity2 will continue piling the pressure on @entity69 until it reverses the decision to nationalize the islands , concedes they are in dispute , and opens up negotiations with @entity12 , said @entity230 , a regional security expert and director of the @entity232 at @entity234 's @entity233			0
' @entity2 has no choice but to take counter measures , ' @entity21 said			0
' if @entity7 continues to reject admitting the disputes , it 's most likely that @entity2 will take further measures			2

@entity2 announced it would impose rules in the airspace above the @entity13
the @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity6 all sent planes through the zone after the announcement with no action from @entity2
@entity2 has now sent warplanes into the zone to protect the airspace
