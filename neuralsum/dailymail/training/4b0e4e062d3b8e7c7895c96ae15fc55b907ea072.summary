prosecutor @entity10 said @entity12 's highest court had ' razed to the ground ' the @entity16 appellate court 's 2011 decision to throw out the guilty verdicts			1
@entity10 will finish his closing statements tomorrow and is expected to request a life in prison sentence for @entity21 and her @entity12 ex-boyfriend @entity22			1

guilty ? @entity3 ( right ) and her @entity12 ex-boyfriend @entity29 were convicted in 2009 of murdering @entity21 's roommate @entity30 ( left )			1
they were freed in 2011 when a court overturned the original decision but another trial was started earlier this year in court : @entity22 , right , arrives at a hearing in @entity22 and @entity21 's trial at an appeals court in @entity26 , @entity12 , on monday @entity21 and @entity22 were convicted in 2009 of killing @entity30 , @entity21 's 21 - year - old @entity41 roommate , who was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in 2007			1

after being freed in 2011 , @entity21 returned to the @entity46 and has not returned to @entity12 for the current trial			0

his 16 - year sentence , reduced in appeal from 30 years , was upheld by @entity12 's highest court in 2010			1
prosecutors have argued that the murder was carried out by more than one person			0
@entity64 : the house in @entity16 , @entity12 , where @entity30 was killed @entity10 argued that the earlier appellate court had ' pulverized the elements , ' separating pieces of evidence that needed to be seen together to get a full picture of the crime			1
@entity10 said @entity21 and @entity22 made efforts to deflect suspicion			2
he alleged they staged a break - in at the apartment to make it appear the killer was an outsider ; he alleged @entity21 cleaned up the apartment in an effort to remove any evidence linking her or @entity22 to the crime , and that she falsely accused another man of the crime			2
the defense has argued that the robbery was not staged and that it would be impossible to selectively remove incriminating evidence			0

an expert testified that the trace on the purported murder weapon was consistent with @entity21 's dna and not @entity57 's			0
@entity21 's dna had previously been identified on the knife , and her lawyers see the new evidence as confirmation that @entity21 had used the knife — found in a kitchen drawer at @entity22 's apartment — for cooking			2
the first trial had identified another trace of @entity116 on the tip of the knife as belonging to @entity57 , but that evidence , which was key in securing the convictions , was discredited by expert testimony to the @entity16 appeals court			0
