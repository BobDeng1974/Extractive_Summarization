a woman who suffered six miscarriages in 14 years has spoken of her joy of finally becoming a mother			0
@entity4 , 32 , gave birth to @entity6 four months early and was warned the baby would not survive			1
after the agony of losing six unborn children she could not bear to look at her first - born child when she arrived at just 23 weeks , weighing 1lb 1oz			1
@entity4 , 32 , gave birth to @entity6 four months early and was warned the baby would not survive			1
she had already suffered six miscarriages in 14 years but to her delight , her husband @entity12 , 32 , turned her round and told her : ‘ look , she ’s moving			0
’ the couple faced further trauma as @entity6 battled for survival at @entity19 in @entity20			2
the couple were not allowed to hold her for the first 18 days - and she spent three months in intensive care			1
she was finally allowed home on august 1 after reaching 4lb 8oz			1
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ it feels like it ’s a miracle - i ca n’t believe i waited so long have a baby			2
i did n’t think it was going to happen			0
‘ i still keep checking on her			0
i ’m forever looking over at her			0
mrs @entity4 , and her husband @entity12 , were not allowed to hold @entity6 for the first 18 days after her birth and she spent three months in intensive care ‘ she ’s lifting her head and doing things you would expect of a four - month - old baby and she smiles a bit			1
‘ we were told it was highly unlikely she would make it			0
‘ they said when she was born she might breathe a little bit but that might be it			0
‘ i thought we were going to lose her - we had a bit of hope but were prepared for the worst			0
’ when @entity6 was born 16 weeks early she weighed just 1lb 1oz and had numerous problems including low blood pressure , respiratory distress syndrome , acute renal failure and jaundice mrs @entity4 , from @entity50 , @entity20 , was always at risk of miscarrying because she has polycystic ovaries and her six previous pregnancies all ended before 12 weeks			1
her hopes were raised when she passed the three month landmark with @entity6 and she rushed out to buy baby clothes			2
but her joy turned to terror when she went into labour at 23 weeks , 16 weeks before her due date - and still a week before the official abortion limit			1
@entity6 ( pictured with her cousin , @entity62 ) was finally allowed home on august 1 after reaching 4lb 8oz			1
her development is expected to catch up with that of other children by the time she is five she admitted to @entity19 on 17 april and went into labour on the morning of 20 april			0
she gave birth to @entity6 who was in the breech position later that day			2
@entity6 was rushed away and her parents were warned her chances of survival were slim			0
doctors managed to get her breathing through a tube but the premature baby had numerous problems including low blood pressure , respiratory distress syndrome , acute renal failure , jaundice , feeding problems , hyperglycaemia and metabolic bone disease			0
@entity6 ( pictured with her mother , @entity86 , her grandmother , @entity87 , and her cousin , @entity62 ) will have to have regular check ups until she is two - years - old to ensure that she is developing normally mrs @entity4 was discharged four days after giving birth and went back to visit @entity6 every day before she was finally allowed to take her home			1
@entity6 will need to be monitored closely until she is two - years - old , but her parents have been told she is expected to have caught up with other children by the age of five			2
mrs @entity4 has since discovered that her great - great - grandmother , @entity93 , weighed exactly the same as @entity6 when she was born in 1910			1
she had to be wrapped in cotton wool for the first six months of her life - but lived into her 80s .			0

@entity4 had six miscarriages before the 12th week of pregnancy
the miscarriages were caused by her polycystic ovary syndrome
@entity6 was born at 23 weeks weighing just 1lb and 1oz
she spent three months in intensive care and was *n't* expected to survive
she has now been allowed home and is expected to make a full *recovery*
