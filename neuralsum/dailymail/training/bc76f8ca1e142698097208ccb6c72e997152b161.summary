@entity0 has said she wants to compete in the @entity1 next august after giving birth @entity0 's pregnancy came as a complete ‘ shock ’ to her – disrupting her eventing schedule and forcing her out of the saddle			1
the revelation came from her husband @entity8 during the couple ’s first joint interview about the pregnancy			1
interviewed by @entity12 , @entity8 said with a laugh : ‘ it probably happened quicker than we thought – bit of a shock , really			1
’ but he admitted that once the surprise had worn off , they realised the timing was perfect.with the child due in january , it means @entity0 , 32 , will still be on track to train for major eventing competitions next year			1
@entity0 was heavily criticised during the summer for continuing to ride during the early stages of her pregnancy			1
despite making it clear she would not yield to pressure from her critics , she has now given up riding – and has taken up baking instead			2
the 2012 @entity32 silver medal winner said : ‘ i have been riding , but it ’s so uncomfortable			2
so , yes , i ’m baking			2
i love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby			1
’ but the @entity36 ’s granddaughter insisted she will be back in the saddle after the birth			1
she even hopes to compete in the @entity1 next august and will take her baby with her on the eventing circuit – which is what her mother @entity41 did after @entity0 was born			1
the couple do not know if the baby is a boy or a girl and @entity8 , 35 , said : ‘ we want it to be a surprise			1
i ’m really looking forward to it , but i ’m not sure how i ’ve prepared			2
we ’ve been pretty relaxed			2
we ’ve not sorted a nursery yet			2
‘ we have ordered some stuff , but we have n’t gone further than that			0
i think we ’re both quite well - balanced and laid - back as a couple , so hopefully he or she will pick up on that			0
’ @entity56 , granddaughter to the @entity36 , says pregnancy came much quicker than she expected and has disrupted her eventing schedule @entity0 added : ‘ i hope we ’re going to make good parents – that ’s the plan			1
’ the couple also talked about the time @entity8 bought a racehorse , @entity63 , at an auction five years ago for £ 12,000 , without @entity0 knowing anything about it			0
after the sale , @entity0 described him as an ‘ idiot ’ and she told the magazine : ‘ i thought it was a stupid idea			0
but he got lucky and it ’s worked out well			0
’ the horse is now worth more than £ 200,000			0
@entity8 , the son of a social worker , has come to appreciate the racing world through his wife			0
the rugby star said : ‘ before i met @entity0 , i did n’t go to meets			0
