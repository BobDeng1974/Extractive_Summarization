by @entity0 published : 01:47 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 1 august 2013 director @entity1 has penned a @entity3 style film based on the advert many struggle to find a housemate who is the perfect match for them			1
but one intriguing advert that offered a rent - free room in exchange for the lodger ' dressing and speaking ' like a walrus was so successful that it has inspired a @entity15 film			1
the @entity17 post described how a home owner had spent months ' constructing a realistic walrus costume ' that his lodger would have to wear for a minimum of two hours a day , while communicating in the ' voice of a walrus ' and eating fish that was thrown to them by their landlord			1
the request was inspired by the poster 's ' fulfilling friendship ' with a walrus called @entity32 while he lived otherwise alone on an island just west of @entity35			1
now having moved to @entity37 to enjoy their retirement , the landlord wants to revive the ' most fascinating years of their life ' by recreating the relationship with someone who could realistically portray a walrus			2
the extraordinary advert caught the eye of many after it was posted on june 11 and went viral , with the landlord saying they had been inundated with people keen to try on the outfit and audition for the role			0
and one high - profile person who was enchanted by the advert was director @entity1 , who has been inspired to pen a @entity3 - style film about the advert			1
the director , whose films include clerks and @entity60 , plans to set ' @entity61 ' in @entity62 , the @entity57 reported			2
the plot revolves around a ' mad scientist intending to sew some hapless lodger into counterfeit blubber ' , according to the newspaper			2
@entity69 and @entity70 are being considered for roles in @entity61 , the @entity68 reported			0
the request was inspired by the poster 's ' fulfilling friendship ' with a walrus called @entity32 the @entity17 advertised for a flatmate with the proviso that they dress like a walrus the unusual request that started the film began with : ' among the many things i have done in my life is to spend three years alone on @entity84			2
' these were perhaps the most intense and fascinating years of my life , and i was kept in companionship with a walrus whom i named @entity32			0
' never have i had such a fulfilling friendship with anyone , human or otherwise , and upon leaving the island i was heartbroken for months			0
' this is a position i am prepared to offer for free ( eg : no rent payable ) on the fulfillment of some conditions			0
' i have , over the last few months , been constructing a realistic walrus costume , which should fit most people of average proportions , and allow for full and easy movement in character			1
' to take on the position as my lodger you must be prepared to wear the walrus suit for approximately two hours each day ( in practice , this is not two hours every day - i merely state it here so you are able to have a clear idea of the workload )			1
' whilst in the walrus costume you must be a walrus - there must be no speaking in a human voice , and any communication must entail making utterances in the voice of a walrus - i believe there are recordings available on the web - to me , the voice is the most natural thing i have ever heard			1
' other duties will involve catching and eating the fish and crabs that i will occasionally throw to you whilst you are being the walrus			0
' with the exception of this , you will be free to do whatever you choose , and will have a spacious double room , complete run of the house			0
' a new lodger has been found , the advert later said .			0
