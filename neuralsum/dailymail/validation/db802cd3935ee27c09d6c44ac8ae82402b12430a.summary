@entity1 's property market is continuously booming , with house prices soaring through the roof - but unfortunately for prospective property buyers , it 's showing no sign of slowing down			1
an auction of a quaint , unrenovated @entity8 home on saturday reaped surprising bids , with the owner of the property managing to bag a whooping $ 1.5 million for the home , which did n't even have a bathroom and had holes in the ceiling			1
on the same day , a stunning beachfront home , owned by former tv comedian @entity17 , in the stylish area of @entity19 in @entity20 was picked up by @entity23 heir @entity21 for $ 10 million			1
' while we have cheap money , people will just extend themselves , ' ms @entity34 told @entity41			2
' also there ’s very low stock on the market , which i have n’t seen in a long time at this time of year			2
' with low stock levels and lowest interest rates ever - which are projected to go down further - moneys cheap and real estates such a solid investment that people are spending big and wanting to buy , but there ’s not much to buy , ' she said			1
the house had holes in the ceiling and did n't even have a kitchen 14 registered buyers turned out for the auction and each battling it out to but the house about 700 homes went under the hammer in @entity62 on saturday and @entity63 put the clearance rate at 86.1 per cent , the second highest result on record			1
ms @entity34 sold 22 @entity25 in @entity8 on saturday for $ 1.5 and said everyone was extremely surprised with the outcome , considering the reserve was set at $ 1.3 million			1
there were between 80 - 100 people at the auction and astonishingly 14 buyers registered to bid			0
the dilapidated four - bedroom @entity8 terrace was unrenovated with no kitchen , no bathroom and not even a toilet			2
the home had been in the same family ’s hands for more than 60 years , but was left in a state of neglect			0
paint was peeling off the walls , holes littered the kitchen ceiling and and the garden was in some serious need of some tender loving care			0
the house did n't have a bathroom , a toilet or a kitchen but was located in prime real estate two other houses on the same street sold last year for less than this house , and they were both renovated however , what it lacked in amenities it made up for in location and buyers scrambled over themselves to be the one to scoop up the hot property			1
' @entity8 is probably one of the hottest suburbs in @entity62 that people want to buy , ' ms @entity34 said			1
' it was what i call a rough diamond			0
it had the right orientation , it ’s faced north at the rear			0
there are only a few streets in @entity8 that do face north at the rear so that was a big plus and it was unrenovated but very solid , it was n't falling down			2
' it was raw , the potential was massive , it was a gem			0
buyers saw that and we ’re prepared to pay big dollars for it , ' she said			0
this @entity20 property was snapped up by @entity23 heir @entity21 the stunning home is set right on the beach and is only accessible by a private path two properties on the same street went up for auction last year and both were renovated			1
one sold for $ 1.45 million and the other for $ 1.55 million			1
' this one did n't even have a kitchen and barely a bathroom so it was a big surprise , ' ms @entity34 said			2
' we 've got too much demand and low supply so unless the supply comes up it ’s not going to meet the demand			2
i 've never heard buyers say to me : " there ’s nothing else to see " , generally they will say : " i 've got five other ’s to see today " - and they ’re not saying that right now			0
mr @entity153 bought the home from his former father - in - law @entity155 @entity21 sold his @entity157 apartment for $ 4.5 million last week so he could move to @entity20 ' i think it ’s a very interesting time , i 've been selling for 20 years and i ca n’t recall another time like this			1
@entity161 ever seen these low interest rates before because they 've never been this low in our country			1
' ms @entity34 said she did n't know what was going to happen to the property market but she believes people are more interested in buying now , due to the high rent prices			1
' @entity170 ’s cheap so people are buying , ' she said			0
' if you were renting a property and you can afford to buy , why pay someone else ’s rent when you can pay your own ? that ’s why there ’s so many people in the market in my opinion			2
' further north in @entity20 a stunning beachside home , formerly owned by comedian @entity17 was snapped off the market by his former son - in - law @entity21			1
interestingly , mr @entity153 's move to @entity20 's seaside replicates that of his ex-wife , who only returned to live there last year after selling her @entity190 home for $ 4.6 million @entity191 and @entity21 were married in 1997 at her father 's @entity192 but separated in 2004 @entity153 had listed his his three - bedroom apartment in @entity157 earlier this month and was hoping to secure $ 4 million for the north - facing home , which he bought in 2008			1
last week , the @entity157 luxury apartment sold for $ 4.5 million			2
interestingly , mr @entity153 's move to @entity20 's seaside replicates that of his ex-wife , who only returned to live there last year after selling her @entity190 home for $ 4.6 million			1

real estate agent @entity211 from @entity33 told @entity41 that they were expecting such a high price for the house , considering the sale price of previous lots in the area			2
' there are five paths there and lot one sold for $ 2.25 million and lot three sold for $ 2 million , ' mr @entity211 said			2
' there is no road in front of it and it can only be accessed by path			0
its an exclusive enclave of @entity20			0
' mr @entity211 also stated that there was a lot of interest in the property but mr @entity153 proposed the highest bid			0
the sale is just short of the @entity20 record set in 2006 at $ 15.68 million , which was set my mr @entity211 the stunning home is as private as you can get and there is no main road at the front of the house house prices in @entity20 have always been high due to desirable location the sale is just short of the @entity20 record set in 2006 at $ 15.68 million , which was set my mr @entity211			1
