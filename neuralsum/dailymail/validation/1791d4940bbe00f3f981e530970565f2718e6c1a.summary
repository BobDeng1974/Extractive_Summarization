the @entity0 blasted senate majority leader @entity1 on monday for holding up the confirmation of president @entity4 's nominee for attorney general , saying the ' unconscionable delay ' calls into question the @entity10 lawmaker 's leadership abilities			1
the verbal strike on @entity12 came after the @entity14 legislator said over the weekend that he would n't allow a vote on @entity18 prosecutor @entity17 's confirmation until the @entity19 passes a once bipartisan sex trafficking bill that @entity21 are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions			1
@entity0 press secretary @entity25 said the delay on the attorney general post reflected ' inept leadership , ' not a flaw in the trafficking bill , and that the move suggested the @entity0 could no longer trust congressional @entity32 to act in good faith			1
the spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the @entity0 and @entity14 leaders after november 's elections , when republicans were swept into control of @entity41 , has since soured and is now curdling			1
in an attempt to balance what they saw as executive overreach on the part of the president , who in november took unilateral action to save millions of illegal immigrants from deportation against the wishes of @entity32 in @entity41 , the @entity14 last month attempted to hold captive funding for the @entity72			2
the majority party ended up with egg on its face , though , when it opted to back down from the fight and appropriate money to the department rather than watching it to go into shut down mode until @entity21 backed a measure to defund @entity4 's immigration directives - a scenario that may have never come about			2
@entity0 @entity32 in january also stuck their finger in the eye of the @entity4 administration when @entity87 secretly invited @entity89 prime minister @entity88 to address @entity41			0
usually , the executive branch coordinates visits with foreign heads of state			0
more recently , @entity19 @entity32 wrote a letter to @entity95 leaders cautioning them that a nuclear pact with the current administration may not last			0
the missive could undermine the tenuous negotiations the @entity100 and its allies are in with the @entity103 country			0
@entity12 is now using the @entity17 confirmation vote as a bargaining chip in his fight to keep a provision that would place heavy restrictions on use of money for abortion in a victims fund named in the child sex trafficking bill			1
@entity21 had already signed off on the legislation in committee before they realized that the measure was included			0
they have since backed away from the bill as is and accused @entity32 of trying to hoodwink them , despite having had weeks to read the legislation in full before a final vote			0
' if they want to have time to turn to the attorney general bill next week , we need to finish up this human trafficking bill , ' @entity12 said sunday on @entity126			2
@entity25 at one point suggested that @entity12 , pictured here last week at a press conferene on @entity129 with other @entity32 , is ' inept ' as a leader @entity4 's spokesman lit into @entity12 on monday over the play			1
' you 've got to hand it to @entity32 , that they 've taken even a measure as common sense as that and turned it into a partisan controversy , ' @entity4 's spokesman said today			2
' the fact that leader @entity12 ca n't build bipartisan support for a child sex - trafficking bill , i think , is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start			1
@entity25 at another point suggested that @entity12 is ' inept , ' the @entity14 leader , he said , should just take out the offending abortion measure in order to get @entity21 back on board			1
' i do n't really understand , ' he said , why the majority leader does n't look at this situation and say , ' let 's remove the objection so we can get it passed , and get it signed into law			2
' although the @entity0 frequently threatens to veto pending bills unpalatable to @entity4 , @entity25 would n't say whether @entity4 would sign the bill with the abortion language included			2
he suggested the issue is moot because @entity32 do n't have enough support to pass it anyway			0
in a sharp rebuke , the @entity0 appeared to question whether @entity4 can trust @entity12 and his fellow @entity14 leaders and ' whether their word is good with the president			1
' @entity25 pointed out that @entity12 had argued last year that @entity17 's confirmation should wait until the new @entity14 - run @entity19 was seated in january , but was now claiming publicly that it was @entity21 who prolonged the confirmation by waiting until 2015			1
the @entity0 spokesman said he is often asked if @entity12 ' is a man of his word			0
' this incident is not ' a very good sign of faith , ' @entity25 proclaimed			0
ironically , @entity14 ' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on @entity17 's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite @entity4 administration officials from the president 's service : @entity192 , pictured here to the left of the president			1
senate minority leader @entity196 chimed in on monday and said that @entity12 ' gave his word ' that @entity17 would receive fair consideration			0
' now he 's hedging on that , ' @entity196 said during a speech on the @entity19 floor			0
' republicans simply ca n't govern , ' @entity196 , the @entity19 's majority leader until @entity14 took over in january , argued			1
@entity12 's spokesman @entity203 blamed the trafficking bill kerfuffle on @entity21 in a statement provided to the @entity206			1
and given @entity0 's hesitancy to issue a veto , he said , the president , not @entity12 , should ask his party members to swallow a version of the bill it does n't entirely agree with			2
' they need to choose between a partisan filibuster and the pleas of thousands of abused children across the country , ' @entity203 said			0
' and they need to do it soon			0
' ironically , @entity14 ' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on @entity17 's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite @entity4 administration officials from the president 's service : @entity192			1
@entity25 confirmed today that @entity192 will remain on the job , â€˜ gettin ' up early and workin ' late , ' as long as is ' necessary			0

the @entity19 majority leader wo n't allow a vote on @entity17 's confirmation until the @entity19 passes a sex trafficking bill
*democrats* are refusing to support the once bipartisan measure over a provision limiting funding for abortions
@entity4 's spokesman @entity25 said the confirmation vote delay reflected ' inept leadership ' on @entity12 's part and suggested the @entity0 could no longer trust congressional republicans
spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the @entity0 and @entity14 leaders after november 's elections is curdling
