by @entity0 published : 13:11 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 26 july 2012 a teenage girl with cancer is being denied life - saving chemotherapy - because she is nine weeks pregnant and the aggressive treatment could kill her unborn child			1
a ban on abortion in the @entity8 means the girl - who has acute leukaemia - is being prevented from having the treatment because hospital officials say a round of chemotherapy would result in terminating the pregnancy			1
aggressive treatment is needed to save the life of the unnamed 16 - year - old , who is being treated at the @entity19 in the capital city of @entity21			2
scroll down for the video plea : the girl 's mother @entity24 ( pictured ) is appealing to both doctors and the @entity8 authorities to make an exception to save her daughter 's life row : the girl is currently being treated at @entity19 ( pictured ) in the capital city of @entity21 for acute leukaemia however , it is unclear whether the girl 's treatment is being withheld because of the law or the doctors ' misunderstanding of it			1
confusion over whether chemotherapy could be classed as a termination is thought to be at the root of the delay			0
the girl 's mother is now appealing to both doctors and the @entity8 authorities to make an exception to save her daughter 's life , it was reported			1
@entity24 told @entity49 : ' my daughter 's life is first			1
i know that [ abortion ] is a sin and that it goes against the law ... but my daughter 's health is first			2
' the case has sparked controversy and has been fiercely debated by government officials and human right groups			0
authorities are currently deciding whether she should be allowed to receive the chemotherapy			2
staff at the hospital are said to be cautious about administering the treatment over fears they could be prosecuted the case has angered human rights campaigners who say the treatment should have been given to the girl immediately however women 's rights activist @entity73 said the delay was ' unacceptable ' and that the treatment should have been offered immediately			1
she told @entity49 : ' how can it be possible that so much time is being wasted ? that the treatment has n't begun yet because they 're still meeting , trying to decide if she has the right to receive the treatment to save her life - that 's unacceptable			2
' the director of the bioethics council , which rules on the application of the law , claimed the council was leaning toward allowing her to have the chemotherapy			0
however , other politicians claimed the debate was ' artificial ' because they doctors were unsure about the application of the law			0

@entity126 37 of the law , which was passed in 2009 , states that ' the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death '			0

doctors *refuse* to administer treatment over fears they could be prosecuted
they say chemotherapy would terminate the pregnancy , which is illegal in the @entity145 country
