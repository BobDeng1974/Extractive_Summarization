wolves provided @entity2 ’s first taste of defeat as @entity5 manager in a 3 - 0 victory at @entity7 back in february — and an air of revenge lingered before kick - off on saturday			1
though both clubs went on to secure promotion from @entity13 in may , @entity5 are a side transformed from the one who rolled over when these clubs last met			1
@entity2 ’s men were ruthless this time round , with goals from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			2
@entity5 boss @entity2 salutes the @entity24 fans after his side 's 4 - 0 win over @entity0 they are now third in the table , just a point off @entity31 ’s @entity30 side in first			1
whisper it , but some fans are dreaming of higher ground			0
talk in the build - up to the game centred on the @entity38 newbies ’ wildly contrasting form			2
@entity5 had four wins from four , wolves three defeats from three			2
in fact , @entity5 ’s stock has risen to such an extent that discussions have begun , particularly inside the four pubs on the corners of their old - fashioned ground , about where the club could play @entity53 football should @entity7 not meet top - flight regulations			1
@entity19 of @entity5 opens the scoring during the @entity38 rout of @entity0 on saturday it has been a monumental few weeks for @entity59 ’s forgotten side			1
at the @entity66 on november 20 , more than 600 guests , including @entity62 boss @entity61 and @entity64 chairman and long - suffering @entity5 fan @entity63 , celebrated @entity5 ’s 125th anniversary			1
in the club shop , meanwhile , fans can buy a beautifully crafted book to commemorate the milestone			0
more than 250 have been scanned through the till in the first week of sale			0
@entity21 ( number 19 ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring his side 's third goal @entity5 are due to move to a new 20,000 - seat stadium just a few miles away before the 2017 - 18 season , but a @entity53 promotion before that date could see them sharing with another club			1
yet @entity2 and the board are refusing to get ahead of themselves , despite saturday ’s emphatic win against a side who finished above them last season			1
the club ’s chief executive @entity88 said : ‘ our primary aim is to stay at @entity7 until our new stadium is complete , whatever division we are playing in			2
‘ @entity7 falls short of meeting @entity53 requirements in some areas			0
we are looking at creative and innovative solutions to meet those requirements			0
’ in his post-match press conference , @entity2 added : ‘ i think whether you go into a local under 9 league or you go into the @entity53 , it ’s about doing the best you can in that competition			2
our competition is the @entity38			0
@entity2 's side are now just three points off @entity31 ’s @entity30 side who lead the championship ‘ we had a good run of five games , but now it ’s december and we start the month with a new target			1

‘ we ’re not going to say that we ’re going to come in the top 10 or the top 12 , all we are saying is that we will try and maintain our level of performance , and see where we end up in may			0
’ when asked about his team ’s rise to third , he said : ‘ it ’s tremendous			0
you ca n’t say anything other than that			0
it ’s a great place to be , we are one point off the top and i think we deserve to be there			2
’ @entity129 ’s double inspired @entity128 to a 2 - 0 win against the @entity38 ’s top side derby at @entity132			1
@entity133 had failed to beat the @entity134 since september 2005 and a current run of 10 games without a win meant expectations were low as @entity31 ’s side came to town			1
but the @entity141 fired the hosts to three points in a fiery clash which saw referee @entity145 show nine yellow cards			0
the club are thriving under the management of @entity2 , and the ownership of @entity150			0
with a new stadium on the way , a blossoming academy , and a team enjoying their best run of form since 1935 , things are moving in the right direction			0
@entity2 reeled off the ages of saturday ’s starting xi. only one of them is over 30 , midfielder @entity163			2
seven of the 11 are 25 or under			0
he said he will only add to his squad in january if he can find genuine quality			0
and who can blame him for that ? they are doing just fine as it is			0
talk of a @entity53 ground - share might turn out to be premature			0
but one thing is for sure , @entity5 are going places — sooner rather than later			2
@entity129 's brace helped @entity128 to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity30 what 's caught my eye ... @entity178 might have thought it was clever to cup his hand to his ear in front of @entity184 fans after scoring on his @entity186 debut			1
his old club had the last laugh , with goals from @entity190 and @entity191			0
@entity192 seemed to turn a corner with wins against @entity195 and @entity0 after an abject run , but they lost their composure at @entity198			1
after @entity199 saw red having made it 1 - 1 at @entity202 , the hosts went on to win with a penalty			1
@entity205 , on loan from @entity207 , impressed by scoring a hat - trick as @entity209 thumped @entity210 6 - 0			1
@entity178 taunted the @entity184 fans as he celebrated his first goal for @entity186			1

@entity5 *cruised* to 4 - 0 win over @entity0 on saturday

@entity129 ’s double inspired @entity128 to a 2 - 0 win at @entity132
@entity178 scores on @entity186 debut
but @entity184 have last laugh with 2 - 1 victory over @entity178 's side
@entity199 sees red in @entity192 's loss at @entity202
