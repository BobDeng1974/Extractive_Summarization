by @entity0 @entity1 : 03:39 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:38 est , 13 december 2013 most of us have old tech gadgets lying around gathering dust , but one engineer has decided to put his to good use			0
@entity9 from @entity10 successfully managed to wire up a 27 - year - old @entity11 - an early version of the @entity17 @entity16 computer - to the web using a @entity14 and proxy server			1
pages took ' minutes ' to load , but @entity9 was able to access the sites through a proxy server manufactured in 1986 @entity34 and @entity35 @entity37 disk @entity39 hard drive 512 x 384 pixel black - and - white screen system 7.0 @entity27 v2.0 browser ( 1994 ) this means it did n’t have a web browser , could n’t read web addresses and did n’t even have an @entity47 in order to connect it to @entity9 ’s router			1
the full process of how @entity9 managed to connect his now antique hardware is available on his blog			2
he began by installing a version of @entity54 - an early version of the @entity16 web browser that runs on the @entity57 operating system			1
to connect the computer to the router , without an @entity47 , @entity9 used a series of old adapters to to connect a @entity14 to the @entity11			1
he then connected the @entity14 to the router			2
to connect to his home network , @entity9 had to wire up his computer to a @entity14 , pictured , and then connect the @entity14 to his router			1
this was necessary because the @entity11 is so old it does n't have an @entity47 port , so could n't connect to the router directly @entity27 2.0 is not capable of reading web addresses and serving links and pages in the same way as modern - day browsers because it does n’t recognise computer languages such as @entity76 or @entity77			1
instead , @entity9 recruited a friend to write a proxy program that took the url of websites , removed all modern - day computer language , cookies and images and turned the sites into basic text versions			1
@entity9 was then able to read @entity29 pages and access @entity30 through the retro browser			2
on his blog , @entity9 explained : ‘ yes , in a certain sense , my @entity16 has already been on the internet through dial - up shell sessions			2
a wikipedia page viewed through the @entity96 browser			0
@entity27 2.0 is n't capable of reading web pages because it does n't recognise computer languages such as @entity76 of @entity77			1
instead , @entity9 used a program that stripped the sites of this computer language and turned them into basic text versions the @entity11 was manufactured in 1986			1
it has 4mb ram and is powered by an @entity35			0
the black and white screen has 512 x 384 pixels and it runs on the @entity106 from 1991			0
according to @entity9 the computer is ' 200,000 times ' slower than modern - day pcs ‘ what it never did was run a tcp / ip stack of its own			0
it was always just a dumb terminal on the ‘ net , never a full - fledged member			0
’ ‘ sure , it was slow as hell , but it worked ! @entity117 loaded , pages rendered , and links were clickable			0
even forms sort of worked			0
’ @entity9 has a @entity120 in management science and engineering from @entity122			0
he also holds a bachelor of science degree in @entity124 from @entity125 .			0

engineer @entity9 *wanted* to connect his 1986 @entity11 to the internet
he used an early web browser called @entity27 2.0 to run on the system
by connecting a @entity14 to the @entity16 , he could connect it to a router
he then set up a proxy server to run text versions of various websites
although @entity9 admitted the pages took ' minutes ' to render
