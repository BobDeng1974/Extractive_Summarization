by @entity1 reporter published : 00:31 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 02:38 est , 26 september 2012 @entity3 military leaders have unveiled a new long - range drone capable of reaching @entity5 and most of the @entity6 months after capturing a @entity7 one			2
general @entity8 , a senior @entity9 commander , described the weapon as a key strategic addition to @entity3 's military capabilities			1
@entity8 , who heads the guard 's aerospace division , said the @entity15 , or @entity16 , has a range of 2,000 kilometres ( 1,250 miles ) and can carry out reconnaissance missions or be armed with ' bombs and missiles '			0
but it 's unclear whether the new drone contains any elements of an unmanned @entity48 aircraft that went down in eastern @entity3 in december			2
@entity3 said it has recovered data from the @entity50 and claimed it was building its own replica			0
@entity3 frequently makes announcements about its strides in military technology , but it is virtually impossible to independently determine the actual capabilities or combat worthiness of the weapons @entity3 is producing			0
@entity28 also test - fired four anti-ship missiles yesterday in a prelude to upcoming naval war games planned in an apparent response to @entity7 - led warship drills in the @entity64			1
advancing technology : the drone can reach most of the @entity6 including @entity5 and nearly doubles the range of previous drones produced by @entity3 technicians the show of @entity3 military readiness came as president @entity71 prepared to address the @entity72 today amid a deepening impasse with the @entity74 over @entity28 's disputed nuclear program			2

in @entity28 , a senior @entity9 commander , gen. @entity8 , also warned that @entity7 bases in the @entity64 could face retaliatory strikes if @entity5 attacks @entity3 's nuclear sites			1
crucial gain : it 's unclear whether the new drone contains any elements of an unmanned @entity48 aircraft ( above ) that went down in eastern @entity3 in december valuable technology : the @entity50 was reportedly used to watch former @entity93 leader @entity92 during the @entity95 mission that killed him the @entity74 and its allies fear @entity3 's uranium enrichment program could lead to atomic weapons , but the @entity7 and others favor a mix of sanctions and diplomacy to try to force @entity28 to curb its nuclear program			1
@entity3 claims it only seeks nuclear power for energy and medical applications			0
near the strategic @entity109 at the mouth of the @entity64 , @entity3 test - fired four missiles it claimed could sink a ' big target ' such as a warship in 50 seconds , gen. @entity108 of the powerful @entity9 was quoted as saying by the semi-official @entity115 news agency			1
the @entity115 report late monday was the first indication of an @entity3 military exercise taking place at the same time as the @entity7 - led naval maneuvres in the @entity64 , including mine - sweeping drills , which got under way last week			0
show of strength : @entity3 has given details of a new long - range drone as president @entity71 ( above ) prepares to address the @entity72 amid rising tensions with the @entity74 over @entity28 's nuclear program the @entity129 claims the maneuvers are not directly aimed at @entity3 , but the @entity74 and its regional allies have made clear they would react against attempts by @entity28 to carry out threats to try to close critical @entity64 oil shipping lanes in retaliation for tighter sanctions over its disputed nuclear programme			1
@entity108 did not elaborate on the ongoing @entity3 exercise or the type of missiles fired , but said the guard is planning a ' massive naval maneuvre in the near future ' in the strait , which is the route for one - fifth of the world 's crude oil			2
