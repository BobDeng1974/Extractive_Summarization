by @entity0 last updated at 2:45 am on 20th august 2011 two terrified @entity2 women hid for more than five hours in a basement ‘ panic room ’ yesterday after @entity6 gunmen and suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of the @entity9 in @entity10			1
at least ten people were killed in the attack which again showed how the @entity6 is able to strike against some of the most secure buildings in the @entity16 capital			2
the women teachers and their bodyguard were among four @entity2 sleeping in the council ’s sprawling compound who made it to the underground bunker after a car driven by a suicide bomber smashed a perimeter wall			1
' when the attack took place , three staff from the @entity2 were in the compound and are now safe			1
' we have 25 @entity16 - appointed staff , none of whom are based at the compound and none of whom are physically affected by the incident			1
' we are working with international partners and the @entity16 government to contribute to the development of the next generation of leaders in @entity16			2
' our work in education gives them the skills that they need to contribute to the development and economic well - being of post-transitional @entity16			1
' @entity70 want to be part of that wider world and they demand the skills , including @entity75 language , to be able to do this			0
' this attack must not and will not prevent the @entity9 from giving those young @entity70 the support they need to be part of that wider world			0
' this signalled the beginning of a five - hour gun battle that left a member of the @entity84 @entity83 among the dead			2
all of the @entity2 were uninjured but were said to be traumatised and recovering last night at the @entity86 as security in @entity10 was stepped up			2
@entity9 chief executive @entity39 said : ‘ clearly , they are deeply shocked			0
they were inside the compound for a very long period of time			0
’ the two @entity2 women , both @entity75 teachers at council - run projects in the city , had been trained to go to the ‘ panic room ’ – which is secured from the inside and fitted with a direct link to the embassy – in an emergency			1
the @entity6 said it had targeted the council to mark the 92nd anniversary of @entity16 ’s full independence from @entity2 – and warned there would be more attacks on foreign targets in the city			1
eight @entity16 policemen , a local municipal worker and the @entity84 soldier were all killed and 20 others wounded after the insurgents set off eight explosions			1
a gunman was then able to fight his way into a fortified area of the council from where he held off @entity16 and @entity119 forces			2
a photograph showed a @entity31 insignia on the left shoulder of one casualty as he was carried on a stretcher from the wreckage of the building but last night his identity was unclear			0
officials said the death toll inside the compound would have been higher had it not been for the bravery of the @entity133 security guards – former @entity134 soldiers – who repelled the initial wave of attackers			0
@entity2 ’s ambassador to @entity16 , sir @entity138 , confirmed that all militants were killed , adding : ‘ this was a dastardly , cowardly attack designed to attack @entity2 interests , but ultimately ending in the deaths of many @entity70 , and we regret the death of the @entity70 in this			1
’ @entity145 condemned the attack on the cultural centre as ‘ vicious and cowardly ’ , promising it would not stop the work of the @entity9 in supporting the @entity16 people			2
@entity16 police said it appeared to have been a well - planned three - phase attack begun when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive vest at a square in western @entity10 – where police were guarding a key intersection – shortly after 1.30am @entity2 time			1
at least eight people have been killed after two suicide bombers targeted the @entity9 in @entity10 blast : a @entity2 security guard ( left ) and an @entity16 policeman walk in front of the site of the explosion at the @entity9 ten minutes later , a suicide car bomber detonated his vehicle outside the front gate of the @entity9 , destroying a wall , which allowed the attackers to pour into the compound			1
a number of @entity16 policemen were killed in the blast , others buried in the rubble			2
the impact of the explosion was so great that it was heard across the city , shattering windows a third of a mile away			0
as the area was evacuated , local shopkeepers said as many as nine insurgents armed with rocket - propelled grenades , heavy machine guns and @entity188 started firing as they ran towards the @entity9 building			0
@entity2 and @entity191 soldiers arrived at the scene to support @entity16 and @entity119 @entity83 in a gun battle that raged for hours			1
scores of troops surrounded the compound while two @entity198 attack helicopters hovered on watch above			0
the @entity6 said it was sending two messages			0
‘ one to the @entity16 government and one to the @entity2 , ’ spokesman @entity201 said by telephone from an undisclosed location one of the two police officers who was killed is carried away from the smoking wreckage by his colleagues @entity2 and @entity16 security personnel quickly moved in to deal with the clash at the @entity9 despite the attack by the @entity6 , bombings in @entity10 these days are relatively rare ‘ we are now reminding them that we will become independent again from all foreigners , especially from the @entity2 , ’ @entity201 said , referring to @entity16 ’s independence from @entity2 rule in 1919			1
mr @entity39 said there had been no specific threat against the @entity9 and the attack came as a ‘ complete surprise and shock ’			0
the council also has 25 @entity16 staff , but they are not based at the compound			2
after the @entity191 , @entity2 has the largest force in the @entity119 - led war against the @entity6 , with around 9,500 troops			0
the attack comes a month after @entity119 handed over security responsibilities to the @entity70 in several areas across the country , as part of a transition process to be completed by the end of 2014			0
@entity16 forces were given responsibility for the city of @entity10 in 2008			0
but @entity119 helicopter gunships had to be deployed there in june to end a siege of one of the city ’s top hotels after a @entity6 attack			0
the explosion happened in the early hours of the anniversary of @entity16 's independence from @entity2 in 1919 the @entity9 said the @entity2 embassy was coordinating with the @entity16 authorities in the city			1
