@entity1 's president may drop the ' stan ' from his country 's name to distinguish his booming oil - rich nation from the rest of @entity7 , where the other so - called stans are mostly mired in poverty			1
the world 's ninth largest nation by area with a population of just 17 million , @entity1 is the largest economy of the @entity16 region , which also includes @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
foreign companies have invested billions of dollars in the nation 's mineral wealth since its independence from the @entity25 in 1991			0
eye - catching : @entity1 's president @entity26 may take the ' stan ' out of his country 's name to distinguish it from other poorer nations in the region which have a similar ending but @entity1 officials say the vast country of steppes and mountains is still little known in the world			1
@entity26 , who visited the nation 's oil capital @entity39 in western @entity1 on thursday afternoon , said a new name like @entity1 , which stands for ' @entity41 of @entity1 ' , would be more eye - catching for a foreigner studying the region 's map			1
' in our country 's name , there is this " stan " ending which other @entity7 nations have as well			0
' but , for instance , foreigners show interest in @entity55 , whose population is just two million people , but whose name lacks the " stan " ending , ' @entity26 's press service quoted him as saying			2
distinguishing features : @entity26 said a new name would make it stand out from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 on the region 's map show of wealth : the elaborate @entity65 presidential residence			1
@entity1 is the largest economy of the @entity16 region thanks to huge investment by foreign companies in the nation 's natural resources the suffix - stan is @entity73 for ' place of ' , ' land ' or country '			1
so in the case of these post-soviet era countries , the individual prefixes give them differing meanings : @entity1 - @entity1 is derived from an ancient @entity83 word meaning ' independent and free ' , reflecting the natives ' nomadic horseback culture			1
@entity17 - the @entity17 originated in @entity55			2
in @entity87 , @entity86 means ' mountain range ' so , when pluralised , the full name plausibly interprets as ' @entity90 '			0
@entity18 - @entity91 means ' crown ' and ik means ' head ' so the prefix likely translates as ' a person wearing a crown on his head '			1
@entity20 - @entity20 is thought to come from two @entity87 words which combine to mean ' genuine man '			2
@entity19 - the combination of @entity102 and men means ' i am a @entity102 '			1
' probably , we ought to consider with time the issue of adopting @entity1 as the name of our country , but before that we definitely need to discuss this with the people , ' he said without elaborating			0
@entity26 , a 73 - year - old former steelworker , has been in power for more than two decades and enjoys sweeping powers			0
titled ' leader of the @entity115 ' and widely nicknamed ' @entity116 ' , he has overseen market reforms and attracted foreign investors			0
but he has kept a tight lid on dissent in his nation which has never held an election recognised as free and fair by the @entity123			0
still vastly popular , he has said he will rule as long as his health allows him to stay in power and promised to groom a successor before stepping down			0
few doubt that @entity1 will receive a new name , should the veteran leader decide so			0
in 1997 , he moved the capital from the leafy city of @entity132 in southeastern @entity1 to the windswept steppe town of @entity134 in the north			0
a year later , he said the new capital should be called @entity134 - which literally means ' capital ' in the local turkic language - to end speculation about @entity134 's name which stood for both ' white shrine ' and ' white plenty ' in @entity1 .			2

@entity26 may use @entity1 which means land of @entity1
says it would be more eye - catching for foreigners studying map of region
is *wealthiest* economy in post-soviet *zone* thanks to investment in oil
@entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are much poorer
