when , just a few weeks ago , the impossibly glamorous @entity1 succumbed to ovarian cancer , the showbusiness world united to lavish praise not just on her striking looks , but a screen presence who lit up some of the most popular television dramas ever broadcast			2
she had travelled a long way from a childhood in wartime @entity10 to the @entity12 glamour of dynasty			1
but for all the acclaim , it was also a journey that left an indelible mark of sadness on the actress , a grief she tried to keep secret not just from her fans , but her closest family			1
strained relationship : @entity24 , pictured left at the height of her 1970s fame , only met her estranged son @entity27 ( right ) a handful of times notably after her death , there was no moving tribute from the 74 - year - old ’s sole surviving son , @entity27 – nor was he invited to the family funeral			1
in fact , the child @entity1 bore as a struggling young actress was a stranger to her and - as @entity39 has established – she nursed a bitter grievance towards him until her dying day			1
an impassioned letter written by the actress , and never seen before now , accuses @entity45 of terrorising her , and claims that the revelation of his existence pushed her into severe depression and drove her father , a former @entity53 flight instructor , to an early grave			1
@entity45 , in turn , blames his mother for abandoning him twice – at birth and as a young man			1
today , the 48 - year - old leads a squalid existence in a rundown housing association flat in @entity64 , @entity65			1
uninterested : @entity24 said she had been ' blackmailed ' by her secret son - while he has called her the ' worst mother ever ' plagued by ill - health and agoraphobia , he exists on benefits – and is likely to do so for some time			1
the actress ’s will , published last week , leaves him not a penny from her £ 350,000 estate			2
it is a decisive confirmation of their estrangement			2
instead , @entity1 left a £ 10,000 legacy to the @entity79 ’ @entity80 and , after the funeral and legal fees , the remainder to her younger sister @entity84 , a former actress			1
mrs @entity84 ’s husband @entity85 plays retired farmer @entity86 on @entity88 ’s @entity87			2
the very private drama of mother and son began on may 12 , 1965 , when @entity1 gave birth to an illegitimate child , the product of a brief liaison with actor @entity96			1
the two had met on the set of television series @entity99			2
@entity1 was living in shared rented rooms and was already a single mother when she gave birth to @entity27			1
bringing up two children on her own would , she felt , be impossible			1
career : @entity24 is pictured here in @entity109 , which broadcast in 1968 , when @entity45 was three			1
he has said she treated him like a member of her fan club so with her own parents still unaware that he existed , the baby boy was adopted by a married couple called @entity116 and @entity45			1
there the story might have ended			2
but at 18 , @entity45 discovered the identity of his birth mother , and , after his then - girlfriend wrote to the actress in 1985 , he and @entity1 were briefly - and tragically - reunited			1
they met on a handful of occasions , but when the news of her illegitimate son broke , @entity1 blamed @entity45 for speaking to the media			1
the pair fell out and never spoke again			1
now a shambling figure with long , unkempt grey hair , @entity45 rarely leaves his flat , where he is surrounded by prescription drugs for depression and his neurological disorder			1
he feels little sympathy for the plight of his mother and expresses no shock that he was left out of her will			1
‘ i ’m not shocked , i ’m not surprised at all , ’ he says			2
‘ i had n’t expected her to leave me anything			2
‘ she did n’t know what sort of person i was – she never even attempted to get to know me			2
it ’s crazy because i ’m a perfectly civilised human being			2
the money might have helped with treatment			2
‘ but it does n’t really make any difference to me now			2
what would have made a difference is if she had n’t given me up when i was a day old			0
‘ if she had just been a normal person , that would have helped			0
she even got the date of my birth wrong in her autobiography			0
she said i was born in 1966 and i was n’t			1
i was born in may 1965			1
’ he and @entity1 met shortly before she joined the cast of @entity161 as @entity162 , the sister of @entity163 , played by @entity164 , in the hit saga about the wealthy @entity166			0
@entity27 recalls his first encounter with his mother : ‘ i was nervous			1
she did n’t say a lot			0
she did n’t seem to understand why i wanted to know who my dad was , or why i wanted to know where i came from			0
‘ i remember her not being particularly interested in me or what i was doing			0
i do remember her crying a bit but i was never made to feel at ease			0
there was no warmth , no empathy			0
‘ it was really awkward			0
i ’m a working - class kid and i ’m down - to - earth			0
but she was n’t down - to - earth at all			0
she was very “ one does this , one does that , blah , blah , blah ”			0
it was all very affected			0
‘ but i was polite			0
she did n’t seem interested in anything such as who i was and where i was from			0
’ the second time @entity27 met his mother briefly in a cafe , and the next day she came to his council flat then and brought him to her home in @entity189 , @entity65			1
he says : ‘ she did n’t seem to want to tell me who my dad was until the last time i met her and she told me his name			0
that time she came to my flat and drove me down to her cottage			0
‘ but she treated me like i was a member of her fan club			0
i can remember coming home with glossy pictures of her			0
i thought , “ what do i want these for ? ” i met her sister briefly and she was all right			0
other son : @entity24 is pictured here with her son @entity203 , who killed himself in 2012 when i found out @entity1 had died i felt nothing			1
how can you cry for someone who gave you away , who never thought anything about you and left you to a horrible life ? where is the maternal instinct in that ? ‘ i do n’t feel like her child			1
it is ironic that she died on @entity215			1
she was the worst mother ever			0
’ @entity45 did not realise the extent of his mother ’s rejection until @entity39 showed him the letter , which made it clear she wanted nothing more to do with him			1
the letter , which has never been published , denounced him as a ‘ criminal ’ following his arrest for attempting to steal a duvet from @entity227			2
it also bemoaned that the revelation about her giving away an illegitimate son could scupper her career in the @entity233			2
@entity1 wrote : ‘ i was menaced , emotionally blackmailed , threatened and terrorised by @entity27 , who as everyone now knows , has a criminal record			1
‘ understandably , i now have no contact with him			0
‘ the disclosure of such an intensely private matter , my own personal grief , a grief i share with no one ( not even my family ) was , to say the least , traumatic			0
‘ my father suffered a minor stroke , followed by several more			0
he died 18 months later , never having recovered from the shock			2
my mother suffered a fibrillation of the heart , resulting in a blood clot forming in her left eye			2
‘ when this healed , scar tissue was left , causing her to go blind in that eye			2
‘ my entire family were subjected to extreme distress			0
@entity258 was i. i must reiterate the distress i suffered as a result of the disclosure			0
’ @entity45 chain - smokes nervously as he denies harassing his mother , saying : ‘ i did not blackmail her			1
‘ and if i menaced her , why did she meet me again ? yes i called her up but that is what any child would do			0
i have no family or support			0
i was abandoned by my mother not once , but twice			0
’ @entity45 says that he had got on well with his half - brother @entity203 , who had worked as a stage manager and a theatre set designer			1
he says : ‘ he was dating @entity276 and i remember we all played @entity277 and drank port in her @entity280 flat			0
’ the reason for the relatively modest size of @entity1 ’s estate , which was just above the inheritance tax threshold , is not known			0
however , in an interview before falling ill , the actress said that her tv work had dried up in recent years			0
in her younger days she had appeared in shows including @entity290 ’ way , @entity291 and @entity292 , a @entity294 ferry soap opera			2
mother and son were never reconciled , even after @entity27 ’s half - brother was found hanged in december 2012 in the garage at their mother ’s home in @entity302 near @entity303 , @entity304			1
@entity203 killed himself after fighting depression and addiction problems for year			1
he had suffered brain damage when he was hit by a car in 2010 while walking his dog in fog			0
mrs @entity84 , 68 , refused to comment about the will when contacted by @entity39 , saying only : ‘ i do n’t want to talk about it at all thank you very much			1
i ’m sorry , but it is all a bit raw			0
’ but for @entity45 there is no forgetting : ‘ what kind of woman hands over her newborn child to a foster mother and then agrees to have him adopted when she knows nothing about the adoptive parents ? ‘ i feel nothing for her			1

@entity24 , who spent decades as @entity12 star , died this march at 74
but there were no kind words from estranged son @entity27 , 48
@entity27 , who has health problems and lives on benefits , was given up
@entity24 left him to be adopted after he was born in may 1965
he later got in touch , but she was aloof and uninterested and they fell out
letter seen by @entity39 shows @entity342 blamed @entity45 for *plunging* her into depression and damaging the health of her parents
@entity45 says he ' felt nothing ' when she died
