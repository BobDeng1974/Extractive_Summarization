for decades , @entity0 suffered from heavy periods and nosebleeds			1
her periods could last for 21 days and , as a result , she developed severe anaemia , leaving her exhausted			0
then , one morning in 2007 , she suffered a nosebleed so severe , she had to be rushed to hospital for a blood transfusion			1
she had woken up to find her top drenched in blood			0
' i 'd had a nosebleed in the night , but this was no ordinary nosebleed ; it looked like a scene from a horror film , ' says @entity0 , 42 , a former @entity16 administrator from @entity17			1
usually , if @entity0 suffered nosebleeds during the night as she slept on her back , the blood draining into her throat would choke her , making her wake up in time			1
normally , i 'd lose about a third of a pint of blood ; that morning , it looked like i 'd been bleeding for hours			1
the top quarter of the bed was drenched in blood , which soaked the pillows , bedding , mattress , even the carpet			0
' i staggered to the bathroom , but started feeling faint			0
seconds later , i collapsed and passed out			0
' @entity0 had lost five pints of blood			1
doctors said if she 'd stayed asleep much longer she could have bled to death			0
@entity0 has von willebrand disease , the most common type of blood - clotting disorder			1
similar to haemophilia , it is caused by a deficiency in a blood protein which means the blood does n't clot			1
but , unlike haemophilia , which mainly affects men , this also affects a significant number of women , and an estimated 1 per cent of the population , around 650,000 @entity58 , have it			0
those affected are particularly at risk after surgery , childbirth or injury , when they can bleed excessively			0
symptoms include nosebleeds , bleeding gums , bruising easily and heavy periods			1
women tend to suffer more due to the bleeding during periods , which also raises risk of anaemia			0
@entity27 disease is caused by a deficiency in a blood protein which means the blood does n't clot up to one in five women with heavy periods may have a blood - clotting problem , and between 10 and 15 per cent of them will have von willebrand disease , says @entity83 , professor of haemostasis and thrombosis at @entity86			1
' lots of women soldier on with heavy periods , thinking flooding , passing clots and periods for weeks are normal , ' he says			0
' this is frustrating , as treatments to reduce blood flow are available			0
but a von willebrand disease diagnosis will not occur to most gps , and awareness is even variable in gynaecology clinics			1
' doctors tend to only think of haemophilia when it comes to blood - clotting disorders , and that mainly affects men			1
potentially thousands of people , particularly women , could have this condition and would benefit from diagnosis and treatment			0
' @entity110 , chief executive of the @entity111 , a charity for people with bleeding disorders , says there may be tens of thousands of people with undiagnosed , untreated von willebrand disease : ' some experts estimate nine out of ten cases are undiagnosed			1
' there are three types of von willebrand disease			1
it is caused by deficiency in a blood protein called von willebrand factor ( @entity127 )			1
with types 1 and 2 , patients have low levels of the protein ; this is not life - threatening , but can cause long , heavy periods , bruising , bleeding gums and bleeding after injury or surgery			1
type 3 , which @entity0 has , is most serious , as patients have no @entity127 ; left untreated , it can be fatal			1
@entity27 disease is diagnosed with blood tests to measure @entity127 levels ; more than one test is needed as levels vary with stress and activity			1
treatments for heavy periods include the contraceptive pill , the @entity149 ( a contraceptive device fitted inside the uterus which releases progesterone , a hormone that thins the womb lining and reduces menstrual flow ) and a drug , tranexamic acid , which reduces blood flow by encouraging clotting			1
another option is a nasal spray of desmopressin , an artificial version of the hormone vasopressin , which boosts the release of stored @entity127			1
it can be used to control bleeding in an emergency , or self - administered on the heaviest days of a period			1
other treatments include endometrial ablation , where a layer of the womb lining is removed to reduce abnormal bleeding , or drugs to induce a temporary menopause			0
patients with type 3 need injections of @entity127 ; in severe cases , this is given as a preventative treatment			0
@entity0 was diagnosed at two , when her adoptive mother noticed she bruised easily and bled excessively			2
' i bled into my joints in childhood and was on crutches and in callipers from age six to 12 , as it was too painful to bear weight on my joints , ' @entity0 says			2
' it became a nightmare when my periods started at 13			0
they lasted 21 days and i 'd feel so faint and dizzy , i could n't go to school			0
' i developed severe anaemia , which made me exhausted and affected my concentration			0
i was prescribed tranexamic acid and , although it helped with nosebleeds and gum bleeding , it did n't improve my periods or joint bleeds			2
' at times , her anaemia has been so severe , she 's been too breathless to walk up stairs and had a heart murmur and palpitations , where levels of haemoglobin ( the protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen around the body ) drop so low , the body is deprived of oxygen , and heart and lungs must work harder			2
@entity0 can now self - inject blood - clotting products every 48 hours @entity0 nearly died at ages seven , 32 and 34 because of excessive blood loss during periods and / or nosebleeds			1
each time , she received blood transfusions and was injected with blood - clotting products			1
' there was n't any preventative treatment given then			0
now , i can self - inject blood - clotting products every 48 hours to reduce the severity of bleeds			1
' @entity0 also had an endometrial ablation in 2011 which has improved her symptoms			2
@entity232 , 37 , has type 2 and says even this can be debilitating			0
the office manager , who lives in @entity236 with her husband and daughters , says her life was ruled by heavy periods for more than 20 years			2
she was diagnosed at seven when blood tests during a bout of measles detected a clotting issue			2
' my main symptoms were nosebleeds and bruising easily , ' she says			0
' when my periods started they were heavy and lasted three weeks			0
i tried many drug treatments through my teens and 20s , including the pill and tranexamic acid , but nothing helped			0
' before and after she gave birth , @entity232 needed infusions of clotting factor so she did n't bleed heavily after birth			2
three years ago , she had an endometrial ablation , but she still has nosebleeds and bruises easily			0
' even now , having a tooth out requires a five - day hospital stay , as i need treatment with clotting factors			2
i ca n't take anti-inflammatory painkillers , including ibuprofen and aspirin , as there is a risk these drugs can cause bleeding in my stomach			2
' as @entity110 says , while symptoms are not usually life - threatening , ' they can massively affect quality of life			0
heavy periods can have a big impact : some women get very tired and anaemic , others wo n't leave the house as they are scared of leaks , affecting school and work '			2
' other type 1 and type 2 patients , including men , may have no symptoms			0
but it 's still important to get a diagnosis so they can be treated with clotting factor injections if they have a serious bleed			0
' @entity296 , lead nurse in haemophilia at the @entity298 , @entity299 , says heavy periods alone would n't warrant investigation for bleeding disorder			1
' but if you 've had heavy periods from the first one , suffer nosebleeds , prolonged bleeding from injuries or dental work , bleeding gums or bruise easily , then being referred for investigation may be advisable , particularly if family members have similar symptoms			2
