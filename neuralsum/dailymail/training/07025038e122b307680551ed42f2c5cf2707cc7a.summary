there are characteristics of dogs that particularly ruthless politicians might be happy to possess			1
energetic , loyal , aggressive and deadly are just a few comparisons that might flatter a country 's leader			2
whatever caused him to notice the likeness one thing 's for certain , you would n't want to be found laughing about it behind the @entity36 agent 's back			2
the comedy comparison is only the latest episode in the weird saga involving the @entity8 premier relationship with animals			1
animal adventures : @entity7 has had a long and photogenic relationship with animals , like being pictured in 2010 hunting and riding through the @entity46 wilderness just days before his 60th birthday in one photo opportunity in 2010 the @entity8 president was seen hunting in @entity50 on foot and horseback despite turning 60 that week			1
perhaps channeling his inner @entity52 he apparently did the whole thing shirtless			0
keen to show his softer side , the man who has kept @entity8 in his grip for the last 13 years also drew a cat 's bottom for laughing children while on a school trip			0
in another bizarre animal - based stunt he flew a microlight aircraft in order to help crane birds navigate a migration route			1
@entity66 around : perhaps keen to show his softer side @entity7 has often been pictured with various animals in an interview today @entity7 said that he has not ruled out running in the country 's next presidential elections in 2018			1
if he wins another six year term he will be in place until 2024 , meaning he will have lead @entity8 for the last 24 years , the same length of time as @entity75			0
while @entity7 did step down in 2008 it was only to avoid a constitutional clause forbidding more than two consecutive terms			0
instead he handed power to his ally @entity80 while he ran operations from the shadows			0
@entity80 duly increased presidential terms from four to six years , then stepped aside as @entity7 was reelected in 2012 .			0

one @entity16 spotted the similarity between these two images
comparison is just the latest bizarre photo involving the premier and animals
