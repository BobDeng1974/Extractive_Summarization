by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 13:08 est , 7 october 2013 a husband killed his wife by pushing her down the stairs and putting a skipping rope next to her body to make it look like an accident after she discovered he was having an affair , a court has heard			1
the body of @entity13 , 32 , was found in the hallway at her home in @entity16 , @entity17 , after neighbours heard her scream followed by an ' almighty bang '			1
her husband , @entity21 , is alleged to have pushed his wife of 12 years and then smothered her as she lay unconscious in the early hours of july 10 last year			1
accused : @entity24 @entity23 has denied pushing wife of 12 years @entity13 , 32 , pictured together on their wedding day , down the stairs then smothering her by the time paramedics arrived at the couple 's semi-detached house the mother - of - three ’s body was already cold and she was in the early stages of rigor mortis , @entity29 heard			1
the jury were told that just before she died , mrs @entity13 has discovered her husband had been having an affair with @entity41 , in her 30s , who worked at @entity43 , @entity16 , where his three children attended			1
mr @entity23 and ms @entity41 exchanged ' thousands ' of text messages including ones detailing sexual acts , the court heard			1
prosecutor @entity49 told the jury the @entity23 ' had separated twice before he begged his wife to return			1
despite claiming he would break contact with his lover @entity23 bought a secret sim card so he could chat with her without his wife knowing			1
mr @entity55 told the court : ' we know @entity13 suspected the affair , we can also see from the text messages between the defendant that she did not accept that he and @entity41 were just good friends			1
' on june 18 he told her the marriage was over because he no longer loved her			2
she left to stay at her mother 's taking the children with her , leaving the defendant in the house by himself			0
' she returned after he assured her he would try to make the marriage work , but she confided in a friend that he had n't been holding up his end of the promise			0
' @entity13 went on the internet to check his phone records where she said she found thousands of texts between the defendant and @entity41			1
@entity75 discovery : a neighbour found @entity13 ' as cold as marble ' at the bottom of a flight of stairs when she rushed around to her home in @entity16 , @entity17 , the court was told ' she called him at work with her suspicions			1
after that conversation @entity21 immediately telephoned @entity41 and they spoke for an hour			0
' @entity23 , wearing a grey suit , white shirt , blue tie and glasses wept in the dock as the jury heard how his wife was found dead in their home			1
a couple of days before @entity13 died he bought a secret sim card to make contact again			2
mr @entity55 added : ' ... rrather than end the affair he and @entity41 , who was at the time still married to her now ex-husband @entity97 , actually continued to plan for a life together , even talking about having children			2
' and he continued that affair after his wife died			2
' earlier mr @entity55 had told the jury that @entity23 television and phone showed he lied to police about when he had been asleep			1
he also revealed that @entity23 had been the first person to bring up the vacuum cleaner and the skipping rope in interviews			2
mr @entity55 said : ' he told police he had seen the [ vacuum cleaner ] when he had gone to have a bath earlier in the night			2
' he also said he could not remember how @entity13 was lying when he found her			1
how could that image not have been imprinted on his memory , the image of the person you say you love lying possibly dead			2
' he was sober that night and there is no record of an illness that would prevent him from waking up , how can he not have heard his wife , who weighed over 12 stone , crash down the stairs			1
' if she was conscious she must have screamed as she fell , and if she was n't then there would have been an almighty crash			2
' the walls were thin and the laminate flooring caused the sound to echo			0
it is inconsistent that he was asleep			0
' he even told police he had been woken up by his children shouting and pushing over an iron			2
and he did n't sleep through his phone vibrating in his pocket			0
' you will hear him go from calm to hysterics in the 999 call later , that 999 call is a sham			0
' in reality we know that he had subjected her to a violent assault , her death was not an accident			0
' fatal : mother - of - three @entity13 , 32 , was found dead at the foot of the stairs at their home on 10 july prosecutor @entity49 had earlier set out the prosecution 's case			1
he said : ' this case is about the murder of @entity13 , she was the wife of the accused			1
' she died between the 9th and 10th of july last year			0
he murdered her at their home			0
' @entity13 was found dead at the bottom of the stairs shortly before 1am on july 10			1
' the defendant denies he killed her , he says he was asleep downstairs when she must have fallen by accident to her death			0
' examination of her body shows that she did not die immediately			0
she lay at the bottom of the stairs for a short time			0
' the prosecution case is that the defendant pushed or threw her down the stairs and if she did not die very shortly after then he smothered her to death			0
' a skipping rope was positioned close to her body to make it seem like she became entangled in it			0
denial : @entity23 denies pushing his wife and mother - of - three down the stairs before smothering her ' when a neighbour who was a registers nurse came to help the defendant she told police that @entity13 ’s body was already " as cold as marble " and that she thought it had been left there for at least an hour - and - a - half			1
' @entity181 and @entity182 , who lived next door , shared a wall with the @entity23 family			2
the only separation was a party wall around four inches thick			0
' they told police they had become used to living with the sounds from the @entity23 household			1
' mr @entity182 even told police he could tell when they were having sex , although that had become far less frequent in recent months			0
' at around 10pm @entity181 told police she heard @entity13 scream ‘ oh my f * * king god ’ , the walls were thin and @entity181 heard every single word , ‘ oh my f * * king god ’			1
' this was unusual , @entity13 was never known to swear in front of her children			2
' they then heard what @entity182 said sounded like something being dragged across a laminate floor and @entity181 said sounded like the opening and closing of drawers and banging of doors			0
' at around 11.30pm they were woken by am almighty crash			0
it was so loud that @entity182 got up and sat at the end of the bed , it sounded like it had come from within their own house			0
' he said they heard reverberation from the double doors downstairs as if they had been slammed shut			0
' if we look at the pictures of the house you will see that number 112 [ the @entity23 ’s house ] there was also a set of double doors at the bottom of the stairs			1
' post mortem examinations were carried out by @entity239 , a home office pathologist with over 30 years ’ experience , who has examined 1,363 homicide victims			1
tragic : flowers for @entity13 , 32 , who was found dead at her home in @entity16 , @entity17 ' there were injuries to @entity13 ’s face , it was concluded these were not from a fall as there was no abbrasion around the injuries			1
' on further examination it was discovered she had a broken eye socket			0
dr @entity239 says this type of break is most commonly found from an assault			2
' it is caused when pressure is exerted on the eye itself , changing the pressure in the socket and fracturing the thin bone protecting the eye			0
' this injury would have been caused by a kick or a punch			0
dr @entity239 said the injuries to her face could have rendered her semi-conscious or unconscious			0
' the abrasions and bruises on the rest of her body show that she was still alive when she fell down the stairs			0
' no cause of death could be gained from the examination , it was recorded as unascertained			0
' dr @entity239 said in his view it was most likely that she was smothered , but that no signs would be present of smothering , if she was unconscious there would be no signs of a struggle , and you would not need to hold the throat , merely close the airway			0
' @entity23 denies one count of murder			1
the jury was shown detailed maps of the injuries to @entity13 ’s body as well as pictures showing her lifeless body lying at the bottom of the stairs			1
they were told that a vacuum cleaner was found at the top of the stairs with its hose uncoiled in a loop by the bathroom			2
mr @entity55 said friends told police this was ' very unusual ' , and that other than the skipping rope there was no sign of any other items left on the stairs			2
toxicology reports showed mrs @entity13 had no traces of alcohol or drugs in her system when she died			1
the trial , which is expected to take six weeks , continues			1
