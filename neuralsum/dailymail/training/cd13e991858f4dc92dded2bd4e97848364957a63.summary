@entity0 admits it will be a dream come true to step out at @entity3 as a @entity5 player for the first time when @entity8 ’s side face @entity9 in their final pre-season friendly on tuesday			1
the occasion also marks @entity13 ’s first home game in charge before @entity5 host @entity15 in their @entity18 opener next weekend , and @entity0 is under no illusion that the deposed champions need to put a disastrous season behind them and get back to winning trophies under the @entity24			1

i think it will help us			0
‘ the main thing is obviously the first @entity18 game against @entity15 for the first match of the season , but we want to keep improving as a team and getting used to the formation so we will be flying when the season starts			2

then i had a couple of weeks off and it has been crazy but i ’m glad i am back now and getting fit for the season			0
‘ i managed to get away and see what it is like on tour			2
i ’d heard a lot of things about how crazy it was and i witnessed that			0
it was great to win the tournament ( @entity72 ) at the end as well			0
‘ until you have gone out there , you do n’t know what it 's like			2
that surprised me but i have heard it ( the fanaticism ) is even worse in @entity113 so i was quite glad we were in @entity60			1
it was really nice to see how many supporters @entity5 have got out there			1
’ new signing @entity118 ( c ) was overwhelmed by @entity5 's support in the @entity121 @entity5 ’s other summer signing , @entity118 , was also surprised to see how popular the club are stateside following his £ 29m move from @entity125			1
