although @entity43 's identity was obscured at the trial , a court technician mistakenly released a recording of her real voice which led to an attempt to run her over as she walked the streets of @entity22			1
after that , according to @entity33 , @entity43 and her husbnand were placed on a witness protection scheme organised by the @entity73 and managed by the @entity9 place			0

she told @entity33 reporter @entity100 that in 2010 the @entity73 and the @entity9 ' bullied ' her with threats of subpoena and even possible detention to testify again , this time against two @entity13 officials who were subsequently cleared			2

and she is disillusioned by @entity134 portrayals of @entity136 programmes which give relocated witnesses a house and car			0

they were blamed for some of the worst atrocities of a conflict for which the term ' ethnic - cleansing ' was coined			0

she added : ' i 'm not defending any party			0
war is the last and worst solution			0
' a team of @entity13 security agents who held top positions in the regime of @entity2 have been linked with the unsolved murder of @entity167			1
in a bizarre claim , it is said the tyrant held a grudge against the @entity173 presenter because she made a successful tv appeal to get help for the millions of @entity177 refugees displaced by his murderous regime			0

killed by the @entity13 ? @entity173 tv presenter @entity167 , left , was shot dead outside her home in 1999			2
