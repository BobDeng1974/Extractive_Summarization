@entity0 will have history behind them and the prospect of making their own when they face @entity4 on saturday			1
@entity6 's men know a victory over the @entity8 would knock their oldest rivals out of the @entity10 , but if they do win they will be getting the better of @entity4 for the first time since 2006			1
that in itself was a rare victory over the world champions and a repeat in @entity17 would put the current crop of players in esteemed company			0
@entity21 ( centre ) is gunning for an @entity0 win against @entity4 in @entity17 on saturday and , for added inspiration , the 17 players selected will wear a specially designed heritage shirt commemorating the jersey worn by the @entity29 side which beat @entity4 in the ' @entity30 ' of 1914			1
' i think all the lads the are aware of the history rugby league has got			2
every time we have the badge on our chest we are playing for a lot of people back at home and people before us , ' full - back @entity21 said			1
' it 's a great way to remember			2
' a @entity45 side led by @entity46 won the 1914 clash 14 - 6 , with the game being reduced to 11 - a - side owing to a shocking list of injuries			2
the @entity45 players were hailed for their bravery and the game was subsequently named in honour of the @entity45 troops that had prevailed at @entity57 in @entity58			0
but for all the looking back , @entity21 has his eyes fixed forward			1
' @entity4 are a wounded animal ( after losing to @entity63 while @entity0 beat @entity64 ) but they have a lot of fight , ' the @entity61 man added			1
@entity6 knows a victory over the @entity8 would knock their oldest rivals out of the @entity10 ' they are coming off the back of a loss that will inspire them even more to do their best to beat us			1
we 'll be prepared and it is exciting - it is a chance for a lot of lads to beat @entity4 on their first tour			1
' we want to knock them out - straight out ( of the tournament )			0
we 're going to @entity17 to win - we 're not going to compete for 60 minutes like we have done			0
we 're going and taking the win			0
' if they are to do that , then they need to iron out some of the inconsistencies from their 32 - 26 win over @entity64			0
' i 'd say we were good in patches , average in patches , ' @entity21 said			2
' at times we lacked focus in defence , which meant they scored 26 points			0
it 's too many , but we have already reviewed it and we need to improve			0
' we fully expected @entity64 to come at us for 80 minutes and they did			0
it 's a side littered with good , @entity106 players			2
