by @entity0 @entity2 chief sir @entity1 said @entity4 's policy of grade inflation has allowed education chiefs to ' fool themselves ' into thinking standards have improved @entity4 's policy of allowing exam grades to rise despite poor educational standards was savaged by the chief inspector of schools yesterday			1
sir @entity1 said the education authorities had been ‘ fooling ourselves ’ for years that standards were improving because grades were going up			1
in fact , the @entity17 has fallen well behind other nations in terms of educational attainment - particularly @entity23 countries			0
sir @entity1 made the comments ahead of the launch of @entity2 ’s annual report in which he revealed 1.75 million children were being let down by poor schools			1
it provided yet another hammer blow to @entity4 ’s education legacy following two major reports that revealed glaring gaps in @entity37 children ’s schooling			1
he told @entity38 ’s today programme : ‘ grade inflation has taken place in our schools and the secretary of state is dealing with the issue			0
‘ there is no question that grade inflation has been operating in our schools			0
we have been fooling ourselves			1
’ @entity49 , of the @entity50 , said in october that research showed young adults in @entity17 have more qualifications than their grandparents but not greater abilities			0
this showed there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills			0
@entity2 ’s report warned 250,000 children are languishing in failing schools and another 1.5 million are stuck in primaries or secondaries rated as requiring improvement			1
sir @entity1 called on the government needed to re-introduce national curriculum tests for seven and 14 - year - olds , saying it had been a ‘ mistake ’ for @entity4 to phase them out			1
in a thinly veiled attack on teachers who complained of spending time on the tests , he said this had been done to pander to ‘ vested interests ’			2
‘ talk to any good headteacher and they will tell you it was a mistake to abolish those tests			2
that ’s because good teachers use those tests to make sure every child learns well , ’ he said			2
‘ in getting rid of the tests we conceded too much ground to vested interests			2
our education system should be run for the benefit of children and no one else			1
sir @entity1 called for the return of tests at the ages of seven and 14 , speaking ahead of the launch of @entity2 's annual report which reveals 1.75 million children are being let down by poor schools in @entity100 ‘ if we are serious about raising our standards and catching up with the best in the world , we need to know how pupils are doing at seven , 11 , 14 and 16			1
’ children ’s performance is already monitored at 11 with maths and reading tests , as well as one on spelling , punctuation and grammar , and at 16 in gcses			1
a reading test has also been introduced for six - year - olds			0
sir @entity1 said the tests should be marked externally as inspectors have found ‘ worrying inconsistencies ’ in teachers ’ own assessments			1
@entity37 and maths lessons were a particular problem , with a third of lessons rated less than good by inspectors between 2009 and 2013			0
a greater emphasis was needed on spelling and handwriting in @entity37 and time should be devoted to allowing pupils to read for pleasure			0
@entity133 questions were too simple and needed to be more demanding , with children taught not just how but why solutions were reached			2
he also revealed inspectors will be sent into schools with no notice from january to stamp out ‘ horseplay ’ in the classroom and instil a respect for learning			0
at present teachers are informed one day in advance , giving them the opportunity to remove disruptive pupils from classrooms or bribe them to keep quiet			0
in future , complaints from parents or teachers will be enough to trigger a visit			0
the report , based on 8,500 inspections from 2012 to 2013 , described run - down schools where there is ‘ litter in the playground and disorder in the corridors ’ , untidy classrooms , chewing gum on carpets and uniform policies that pupils routinely ‘ flout ’			2
‘ around 700,000 pupils attend schools where behaviour needs to improve , ’ he said			0
‘ unless this changes , teachers will struggle to create an environment in which all children learn well			2
’ the report found a record eight out of ten schools were now rated good or outstanding			0
but it said three factors were hindering progress - mediocre teaching and leadership which allows misbehaviour to flourish , regional differences in the quality of education and underachievement of poor children , particularly among white pupils			1
it repeated his suggestion for a ‘ national service ’ of teachers and headteachers who can move into failing schools or areas for up to two years to turn them around			0
sir @entity1 said : ‘ there are unmistakeable signs that @entity100 ’s education system is gradually improving			1
‘ if our destination is the high peaks of a world - class education system and the economic benefits that follow , we are now in the foothills			0
’ a @entity207 spokesman said : ‘ @entity2 is right to place a high premium on good behaviour			1

sir @entity1 said education chiefs have been ' fooling themselves ' that standards are rising because grades have been improving
