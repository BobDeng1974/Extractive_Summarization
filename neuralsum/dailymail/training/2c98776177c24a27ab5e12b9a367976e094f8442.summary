a dangerous trend of @entity6 men grooming young white girls does exist , according to a @entity15 home affairs committee report			1
police , prosecutors and social workers must be able to raise the issue without fear of being accused of racism , the committee said			1
but it warned against stereotyping offenders because there is no straightforward link between race and child sexual exploitation			1
in shocking conclusions to a year - long inquiry , mps said there were still areas where victims were being failed by the authorities			0
they accused councils in @entity37 and @entity38 of being ‘ inexcusably slow ’ to realise sex abuse was taking place on their doorstep			0
and they said both councils had a ‘ woeful lack of professional curiosity ’ and were responsible for the ‘ appalling consequences of their indifference to the suffering of vulnerable children ’			0
writing in the report , mps said : ‘ there is no simple link between race and child sexual exploitation			1
’ however , as the @entity57 has frequently highlighted , they add : ‘ evidence presented to us suggests there is a model of localised grooming of @entity6 - heritage men targeting young white girls			1
‘ this must be acknowledged by official agencies who , we were concerned to hear in some areas of particular community tension , had reportedly been slow to draw attention to the issue for fear of affecting community cohesion			0
‘ the condemnation from those communities of this vile crime should demonstrate that there is no excuse for tip - toeing around this issue			0
it is important that police , social workers and others be able to raise their concerns freely , without fear of being labelled racist			0
’ last month seven @entity87 men , mostly of @entity6 heritage , were convicted at the @entity89 of running an appalling paedophile sex ring			1
abusers : the men who took part in a child sex ring in @entity37 which exploited vulnerable teenage girls ( top row left to right ) @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
( bottom row left to right ) @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity98 @entity104 said protecting vulnerable children should be the ' first priority ' the case followed another , almost exactly 12 months earlier , in which nine @entity110 men based in @entity37 were involved			2
in both crimes , teenage girls , most of whom were vulnerable and in care , were picked up in the street and at takeaways and groomed for sex with gifts of drugs and alcohol			2
the committee called on the government to introduce special courts to ensure child sex attackers are brought to justice			2
it said vulnerable victims deserve better treatment and demanded the @entity131 act quickly to protect them			0
the committee highlighted how some young victims found the trial of their abusers more harrowing than their crimes			1
some vulnerable victims were subjected to marathon cross-examinations by teams of aggressive defence barristers			0
on one occasion bungling staff showed the face of a victim to everyone in court , despite the judge ordering only an audio link was needed			2
@entity150 chairman @entity104 said : ‘ protection of these vulnerable children must be our first priority			0
’ a @entity131 spokesman said : ‘ we constantly look for new ways to support and protect vulnerable witnesses when appearing in court			0
