more than a third of workers are sleepwalking into a retirement nightmare because they have no plan for a pension , a new report has revealed			2
many who are banking on a company pension will discover it is worth far less than hoped			1
those newly auto - enrolled into company schemes are likely to be left disappointed , meanwhile , because contributions made over the years wo n't afford them the retirement they dreamed of			2
planning ahead : just a fifth of people are meeting savings targets for their pension , a report found ( file photo ) the report , compiled by a pension firm and a research centre , is drawn from research which also showed @entity24 lagging behind developing countries such as @entity26 and @entity27			1
it will add to fears that @entity24 is sitting on a pensions time bomb , with the system unprepared for the demands put on it in years to come			1
former number 10 adviser and pensions expert @entity34 said : ‘ this is another wake - up call			2
‘ if you leave planning your pension until the time of retirement , it is much too late			2
‘ planning for later life is a journey and someone needs to help you get on the right path			0
‘ pension schemes should have to send people regular statements explaining how to people make a financial plan and how important it is to have one			1
’ @entity55 closure of final salary schemes is also to blame , the report said			0
at the end of last year , only 1.7million private sector workers were still contributing to a final salary pension scheme			2
in 1995 , the figure was five million and as recently as 2008 , there were still 2.6million			0
in 1997 , more than a third ( 34 per cent ) of staff at private sector companies were members of a final salary scheme but by 2012 , this had slumped to just 8 per cent			0
shock : many on company pensions will find them less valuable than they first thought , it is claimed ( file photo ) the report from @entity24 pension provider @entity73 , in collaboration with the @entity77 research centre @entity78 , asked 16,000 workers and retirees in 15 developed countries about their preparations for old age			1
in the @entity24 , 900 employees and 100 fully - retired people were interviewed			1
it found 39 per cent have yet to save any money or consult a financial adviser about their later years			0
nearly half admit they have an idea about retiring in their heads , but have yet to sit down and formally make a plan about how much they want – or how to save enough to get there			0
' a good retirement income does n't happen by accident			0
current measures might make sure most people do n't starve but if you want any more than that then you need to take responsibility for your own future ' @entity105 , head of pensions at @entity107 the findings also showed that in @entity24 barely a fifth of people ( 22 per cent ) said they were on track with their pension contributions to meet the target they needed for retirement			1
half of workers also expect to continue working into their retirement and just 29 per cent expect to stop work entirely , even though their parents ’ generation enjoyed such a privilege			0
a key conclusion was that in @entity24 the complexity of financial products and a lack of financial understanding ‘ can make saving unnecessarily difficult ’			1
in a bid to help address the problem , the government has embarked on a series of radical reforms			0
these include the introduction of a new £ 155 - a - week state pension in 2016 and an overhaul of the current system which forces savers to swap their pension savings for an annuity – or annual income for life – when they stop work			0
from next year , workers will no longer have to buy an annuity and will be able to access their pension pot from age 55			0
overall , the @entity24 ranks joint sixth with @entity152 in the retirement readiness index , behind countries like @entity155 and the @entity77 @entity105 , head of pensions at @entity159 wealth manager , said : ‘ a good retirement income does n't happen by accident			1
‘ the current measures such as auto enrolment and the state pension might make sure that most people do n't starve but if you want any more than that then you need to take responsibility for your own future			1
