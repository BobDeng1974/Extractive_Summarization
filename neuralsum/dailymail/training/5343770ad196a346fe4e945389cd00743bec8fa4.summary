original texts : the first ever editions of the @entity2 , released in 1812 , reveals a far darker side to children 's stories known around the world ' here 's a knife ... if the slipper is still too tight for you , then cut off a piece of your foot			1
it will hurt a bit			1
but what does that matter			1
' if you ever had @entity18 read to you as a child , you probably wo n't be familiar with this extract - where the stepsisters are urged by their mother to self - mutilate in a bid to marry the prince			1
incidentally , he then noticed the blood sloshing around in the ' golden ' slipper , thus thwarting their ugly scheming			1
if you 're not familiar with this grimmer version of the @entity2 tale , you 're not alone - as it comes from the first - ever @entity34 translation of their original edition , which was released in 1812			1
and it 's not just @entity18 which was wholly unsuitable bedtime reading for children : @entity40 becomes pregnant after having a ' merry time ' with her prince in the tower - and it 's @entity46 's real , not step , mother who orders the huntsman to ' stab her to death '			1
elsewhere it 's @entity51 's biological mother who abandons them in the forest because she ca n't afford to feed them			1
when @entity55 and @entity56 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , published the first version of the now classic collection , then called @entity61 , they had no idea the 86 stories would reach such a wide audience			1
a second volume of 70 tales followed in 1815 - and another six editions over the next 40 years , each one revised and , crucially , more and more child - friendly			1
in the process , some of the most unsavoury ones were left out , such as how @entity72 played at slaughtering - in which one boy cuts the throat of his little brother while playing butcher and pig			1
another later omitted was @entity80 , where a mother threatens to kill her daughters since there is nothing left to eat			1
@entity86 , professor emeritus of @entity88 and comparative literature at the @entity89 , decided to go back to the @entity91 ' roots out of curiosity and translate the first two editions ( all 156 tales ) which was published last month as @entity95 of the @entity2 : the @entity96			1
he believes that the pair changed the stories in the later editions because they ' held motherhood sacred '			1
changes : in the first two editions of the @entity56 tales , @entity40 becomes pregnant after having a ' merry time ' with her prince in the tower while in @entity51 it 's their biological mother who abandons them in the forest because she ca n't afford to feed them according to @entity112 , he speculates that the @entity91 ' changes were ' reflecting sociologically a condition that existed during their lifetime - jealousy between a young stepmother and stepdaughter as ' many women died from childbirth in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and there were numerous instances in which the father remarried a young woman , perhaps close in age to the father 's eldest daughter			1
' the academic , who took 18 months to translate the text , told the paper that the changes made were ' immense ' , suggesting the original tales were not published with children in mind , with up to 50 tales heavily edited or deleted for later editions			1
for example @entity86 believes @entity56 got rid of the tales that would a ' religious middle - class sensitivity '			1
in the introduction to the book , he writes : ' all these editorial changes to the tales in the first edition of 1812/15 should not lead us to believe that the tales were crude , needed improvement , and do not deserve our attention			1
' moreover , the @entity91 had not yet ' vaccinated ' or censored them with their sentimental @entity150 and puritanical ideology			1
in fact , the @entity2 endeavoured to keep their hands off the tales , so to speak , and reproduce them more or less as they heard them or received them			1
' that is , the tales were not their own in the first place			1
though they gradually made them their own , these stories retained other voices and still do			1
they originated through the storytelling of various friends and anonymous sources and were often taken from print materials			2
' @entity86 adds : ' these first - edition @entity91 ' tales have a beguiling honesty and an unusual perspective on human behaviour and culture			1
' gruesome : in the original @entity18 , her stepsisters try to cut off part of their feet with a knife so they can fit into the slipper authors : @entity86 said the @entity181 ( pictured together right and left ) changed the stories in the later editions because they ' held motherhood sacred ' not aimed at children : @entity46 's real , not step , mother orders the huntsman to ' stab her to death ' twist to the story : as evidence of her death , the mother asks the huntsman to bring back her lungs and liver as proof that she has been killed ' [ the 1812 edition ] was not published for children or general readers ... it was only after the @entity91 published two editions primarily for adults that they changed their attitude and decided to produce a shorter edition for middle - class families			1
this led to [ the ] editing and censoring many of the tales , ' he told @entity112			1
some stories were later omitted , not due to their gruesome quality , but their heritage : for example , @entity213 and @entity214 were not reprinted because of their @entity218 origin			1
the new book , published by @entity220 , offers a fascinating insight into how the collection has changed with the times			2
professor @entity86 pointed out that around 50 stories in the first edition were either deleted or radically revised by the seventh edition in 1857 , considered as the standard version even today			1
