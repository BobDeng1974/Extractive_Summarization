when @entity3 confirmed the audacious signing of @entity7 wing @entity5 this week , the scale of their transfer coup was illustrated by the complaints emanating from @entity7			1
‘ i ’m extremely disappointed he ’s going , ’ said @entity9 , coach of the world champions , having learned that the 23 - year - old had rejected a new deal with the @entity13 and @entity14 in favour of a season in @entity17 , in 2016 - 17			2
his views were echoed , more robustly , by commentators and fans alike			2
that might not be the end of the short - term @entity25 exodus , despite @entity27 ’s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the @entity30 in 2017			2
@entity5 rejected a new deal with the @entity13 and @entity14 in favour of a season in @entity17 fly - half @entity33 is thought to be deciding between a move to @entity36 or @entity37 in @entity38 – while the latter club have already landed @entity40			1
the prospect of piles of @entity43 and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the @entity48 league the destination du jour , for southern stars seeking a stint abroad			1
what makes the @entity54 deal so eye - catching is that it is a bold endorsement of @entity3 ’s ambition and also a boost to the wider @entity59 game , below test level			1
that boost is much - needed , because there are simmering problems – as exposed and bemoaned by @entity64 ’s head coach @entity63 last weekend			1
the @entity65 was infuriated by the softly - softly stance of @entity68 coach @entity67 , whose final say on release of @entity72 players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the @entity76 clash with leaders @entity78			1
@entity79 can put his body on the line for @entity82 and @entity83 ‘ it hurts the league , ’ said the @entity65 , which is absolutely true			2
the @entity76 has a credibility issue , due to the continuing absence of so many @entity88 stars from so many matches			1
while player welfare is quite rightly prioritised , there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions			2
no wonder the @entity96 regions were so keen to align themselves with the @entity99 clubs during the @entity101 rebellion last year			2
a leading figure such as @entity79 gives body and soul to the @entity82 week after week , but still found the energy to face down the more rested @entity88 in @entity106 during the @entity107			1
he and so many others in @entity83 would enhance the @entity99			2
if the @entity88 can not fully commit to a league – making it a fitting stage for @entity5 ’s class – they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for @entity101 combat with their provinces			1
scrap the @entity118 and bring the regions into an expanded @entity99			2
@entity122 forward @entity121 was clumsy , not reckless @entity122 players were incensed by the three - game ban handed to their no 8 , @entity121 , for the collision which left @entity127 unconscious last friday night , and their angst is understandable			1
the big @entity129 was clumsy , but no more , by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the @entity30 wing , as he scored a try			1
@entity121 was clumsy rather than reckless and did n't deserve a three - game ban the disciplinary panel called the offence ‘ reckless ’ and the reaction of @entity122 captain @entity139 was priceless			1
‘ @entity140 is reckless , ’ he said			2
‘ the whole game is reckless			0
if you ’re going to worry about that … maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch			0
’ the @entity148 flanker had a point			0
the sport is founded on physicality and danger			0
a player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated , damaging contact , however accidental , but the suspicion lingers that @entity121 is serving a ban because @entity158 was knocked out			1
if the scorer had jumped up and walked off , it ’s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed			0
fill @entity164 seats or face fan fury is anyone really surprised that trying to buy @entity164 tickets is such a drawn - out ordeal ? for those without the benefit of a corporate invite ( or a media pass , before anyone pipes up ) , securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root - canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket			0
the @entity179 visits a school in @entity181 as part of the @entity183 we are in the cost - cutting age of do - it - all - online , so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on monday			1
at least the old - fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit , as so wonderfully evident at @entity193 tennis down the years			0
ultimately , the @entity164 will be a sell - out , but organisers better be right when they say there wo n’t be the empty seats which blighted the @entity198			0
as if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough , those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well - heeled ‘ guests ’ ca n’t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena , or even turn up at all			0
signing @entity208 is an inspired move it ’s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt , which is harsh on all concerned			0
@entity208 is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in @entity217 later this year , from the @entity218 to @entity219			0
@entity219 's signing of rugby league legend @entity208 is a statement of intent he wants to play fly - half and while the prospect of him igniting the championship at the age of 34 is far - fetched , he is a proven leader and winner , and his mentality is what the union side at @entity230 are keen to tap into			1
no doubt , he ’ll bring a few more through the turnstiles , too , but coach @entity233 will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him			0
it is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation , @entity217 are another second - tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile			0
last word @entity247 , under the auspices of @entity148 , face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the @entity252 tournament in @entity253			0
in @entity259 last weekend , @entity255 ’s side – nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of @entity257 , ahead of @entity83 and @entity258 – lost further ground to @entity261 and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings , one below the final qualification slot			0
this weekend in @entity266 , they must try to catch their rivals from @entity268 , but they have been drawn in a pool with @entity270 , who won in @entity259 and are second in the rankings behind @entity273			0
realistically , one @entity252 place is up for grabs , behind those nations and @entity7 , and @entity148 ’s advantage is that the series culminates at @entity279 next month			0
sadly , @entity247 ’s preparations – complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby – have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight , and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting .			1

capture of @entity5 is a bold endorsement of @entity3 's ambition
@entity64 were forced to rest @entity88 stars for @entity76 clash with @entity78
@entity121 did not deserve ban for clumsy *challenge* on @entity127
