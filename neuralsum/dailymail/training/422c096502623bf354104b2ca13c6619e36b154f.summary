@entity3 could have sexually abused up to 1,350 victims , treble the number who have come forward so far , the police officer that exposed him said today			1
@entity7 , which is looking into allegations of sex crimes against the former dj and presenter , as well as a host of other celebrities , has recorded 450 complaints against him			2
but former metropolitan police commissioner @entity15 , who led @entity16 until earlier this year , told an @entity18 conference that as well as those who came forward there were ' probably double , treble who have n't '			1
paedophile : there have been 450 complaints of sexual abuse by @entity3 - but it is alleged there could have been three times as many victims , according to former met chief superintendent @entity15 ( right ) ' my best guess is that there are many other victims who wo n't have come forward because they do n't want to talk about it , ' he told @entity37 ' they 've dealt with it , they 've put it in the past			1
' so even with the 450 that have come forward there must be many more			0
that 's not just true for @entity44 , it 's true for other offenders as well			0
' a report released earlier this year revealed the disgraced tv presenter was one of the @entity50 's ' most prolific known sexual predators ' and said his victims included an eight - year - old boy and a seriously ill teenager			0
the report by @entity55 and the @entity18 , released in january , found that @entity3 's reign of sexual abuse spanned 54 years			0
since the initial claims emerged in early october last year the former @entity60 host , who died in 2011 at the age of 84 , has had 214 criminal offences recorded against his name , including 34 rapes , disgraced : around 450 individuals have contacted police with allegations against @entity3 since the launch of @entity7 mr @entity15 stepped down from @entity7 earlier this month to become an assistant inspector of constabulary			1
other have previously said the number of possible @entity74 victims could be much higher			1
@entity75 , who presented the original @entity77 documentary which first exposed the @entity78 'll fix it star as a dangerous sexual predator , said he could have targeted hundreds more victims in his near six decades of abuse			0
in january he said : ' the first offence was in 1955 and the last in 2009 , that 's almost 60 years of offending			0
there could be at least double the number of potential victims , it 's a mere drop in the ocean			2

@entity15 : ' there must be more . probably double or treble '
