the selection of vulnerable people for high pressure sales cold calling can involve ‘ sucker lists ’ which contain names and details of elderly people considered likely to be easily persuaded to buy over the phone			2

the scale of targeting of the elderly by firms engaged in making an estimated billion nuisance calls a year was revealed by a @entity31 survey			1
it found that more than nine out of 10 elderly people had been subjected to a nuisance sales call or a text over the past month , and nearly a quarter said they had at least two a day			1
while 92 per cent of those over 60 received at least one call or text , 23 per cent said they received two or more a day			1
this compared with just six per cent of people under 25 receiving nuisance calls at the same rate			0
the survey , carried out for the @entity49 , said three out of four people who received unwanted sales calls said they hung up , half refused to answer the call , but fewer than one in six made a complaint			1
more than half called for stronger @entity56 regulation of phone marketing companies			0

more than a quarter reported sales calls they did not want from energy or phone companies and 16 per cent said they had unwanted sales calls from banks			0
details of older callers are traded by companies that sell on details of people who have bought from them , and in some cases by lead generator companies that glean details of elderly people using methods like fake advertisements			0
marketing firms that use sucker lists rely on the assumption that some older people will welcome a friendly voice on the phone and some are easily persuaded to part with their money			1
the targeting of older people was detailed following a report by the government - appointed @entity110 which demanded £ 500,000 fines for firms which break marketing rules and for directors of companies to be held personally responsible for breaches of the rules			2
its report said there should be tougher regulation of firms making unwanted calls which cause ‘ severe distress ’ .			0
