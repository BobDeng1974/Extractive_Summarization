by @entity0 a @entity2 worker holds one of 20 new @entity5 skulls discovered beneath @entity7 's @entity6 construction workers in @entity7 have made an ' unexpected and fascinating discovery ' during work on the city 's billion pound @entity2 project			1
around 20 @entity5 skulls have been unearthed by tunnellers working beneath @entity6 , where the historic @entity15 flows			1
working under the direction of @entity2 's archaeologists , the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls and @entity5 pottery			1
they were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary			2
for safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground			2
the @entity30 scheme has already led to a number of exciting discoveries , including around 4,000 skeletons found buried in the @entity35 area			0
these skeletons were found in august and will be carefully removed during major archaeological excavations next year			0
the latest discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic @entity43 burial ground			1
bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century			1
historically , @entity5 skulls have been found along the @entity51 during various excavations in the region			1
this led to speculation the skulls found were heads decapitated by @entity59 's army during the rebellion against @entity5 occupation in the 1st century @entity62			1
the latest discovery of the skulls , pictured , and pottery was made below the site of the historic @entity43 burial ground			1
bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century archaeologists believe the skulls , pictured , may have washed downstream along the @entity15			1
they were found six metres under the ground below what is thought to have been a 16th century burial ground for patients of the @entity43 hospital the hospital was originally called @entity43 – or @entity43 was founded in 1247 by @entity79 , a wealthy former sheriff of @entity7			1
its graveyard was built on the hspital ’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the city started to overflow			0
@entity43 's name quickly became pronounced ‘ @entity43 ’ by @entity87			2
by 1403 , the majority of its patients were lunatics			0
others suffered from epilepsy , learning disabilities and dementia			0
@entity96 later suggested the @entity15 may have eroded a @entity5 cemetery under @entity35 , and the skulls and other bones had been washed downstream			1
because the latest skulls were located in clusters , the archaeologists believe this indicates they were caught in a bend in the river and were washed out of the burial ground during @entity107			1
lead archaeologist @entity108 said : ' this is an unexpected and fascinating discovery that reveals another piece in the jigsaw of @entity7 's history			0
' this is n't the first time skulls have been found in the bed of the @entity15 and many early historians suggested these people were killed during the @entity59 rebellion against the @entity107			2
' he went on : ' the skulls are possibly from a known @entity5 burial ground about 50 metres up river from our @entity6 station work site			1
' their location in the @entity5 layer indicates they were possibly washed down river during the @entity5 period			2
' the @entity132 will analyse the finds and hope to find out more about the age , sex and diet of the people associated with the @entity5 skulls			1
however , it will be difficult to distinguish @entity43 patients from other dead because mental illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons one of the @entity2 tunnels at @entity6 where the skulls and skeletons were discovered			1
some archaeologists thought the skulls may have been decapitated in the first century , while others claim the skulls come from an eroded @entity5 cemetery the latest skulls were located in clusters indicating they had been caught in a bend in the river			1
the skulls and skeleton will be removed during archaeological excavations next year the tunnellers have also discovered wooden medieval structures believed to have been part of the walls of the @entity43 burial ground			1
it is thought headstones from the @entity43 cemetery were used as foundations for modern - day buildings			2
the hospital was originally called @entity43 – or @entity43 – and was founded in 1247 by @entity79 , a wealthy former @entity171 , as a priory dedicated to @entity173 of @entity43			0
its graveyard was built on the hospital 's vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the city started to overflow			0
as well as patients , it was used to bury @entity7 ’s poor and religious non-conformists			0
@entity43 's name quickly became pronounced ‘ @entity43 ’ by @entity87			0
by 1403 , the majority of its patients were lunatics			0
others suffered from epilepsy , learning disabilities and dementia			0
the @entity132 will analyse the finds over the coming months and hope to find out more about the age , sex and diet of the people associated with the @entity5 skulls			1
however , it will be difficult to distinguish @entity43 patients from other dead because mental illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons			0
investigation : 4,000 skeletons will be disinterred and studied before being reburied elsewhere in most cases , identification will be impossible , because although some were buried in coffins , any name plates recovered have been too rusty to read			0
the dig ’s manager , @entity211 from the @entity132 , is part of a team of more than 100 archaeologists who are examining each of the 40 sites being dug up for @entity2			0
the 73 - mile rail line that will link the @entity218 , @entity219 , the @entity220 and @entity221 to commuter areas east and west of @entity7			0
the @entity15 formed from tributaries coming from @entity225 , @entity226 and merging in the @entity228 area of @entity7			0
it flows through the middle of the @entity230 beneath the @entity231 and joins the @entity232 between @entity233 and @entity234			2
it is believed to be named after a brook that ran through the @entity237 , built by the @entity107 around @entity7 to protect the city			0
@entity107 built the @entity239 , which worshipped the ancient religion of @entity241 , on the banks of the @entity15 in the 3rd century @entity244 temple was found during construction work in the 1950 's			2
following the invasion of the @entity248 in the 6th century , @entity246 were forced to live on the east bank of the @entity15 , while the @entity248 lived on the west			2
the @entity15 began being covered by buildings in 1440 and it now runs entirely underground , running parallel to a street called @entity15			2
