some might say @entity0 is a huge @entity1 fan , but there 's a possibility he 'll be looking back in anger at a moment he shared with @entity5			1
former @entity6 defender @entity0 has previously explained his love for @entity1 - a band whose music will surely live forever - but the @entity11 pundit got more than he bargained for when he asked @entity5 to sign one of his guitars			1
an avid @entity15 fan , @entity5 jumped on the opportunity , returning it covered in abuse and ' @entity15 ' scribbles			1
@entity0 posted a picture of his defaced guitar , signed by @entity5 with a personalised message on the front of the guitar , @entity5 had scribbed ' @entity15 ' four times around the outside but only now has @entity0 revealed photographic evidence of the exact message written by @entity5			1
' @entity30 , ' the guitar reads			0
' how many caps have you got for @entity33 ! ! how many have you deserved ? ? i 'll tell you ... f * * * * * * none ! ! lots of love , @entity5 x @entity15 ' @entity0 could be forgiven for crying his heart out at such a scathing attack from one of his heroes			2
@entity5 ( left ) was recently interviewed by @entity0 for a @entity11 feature , in which they spoke of the incident @entity0 , since retiring from professional football , has forged a successful commentary and punditry career he previously admitted to @entity50 that he loves @entity1 , but should have known what to expect from @entity15 - supporting @entity5			2
' i was a big @entity1 fan ' , @entity0 said			0
' i started learning the guitar for a few years and just sent it ( to ) him one day			0
i got it back with that ! should n't have been surprised , really ! ' @entity0 has tipped @entity57 to definitely win the league , but maybe @entity15 can catch them			2
if so , @entity5 is sure to be in a @entity59			0
@entity5 will be hoping @entity15 can claw back the @entity61 title			0

@entity0 sent a guitar to @entity5 to get them signed
@entity5 returned it with @entity15 scribbles and *joked* abuse
@entity0 has posted photos on @entity71 of the guitar in question
