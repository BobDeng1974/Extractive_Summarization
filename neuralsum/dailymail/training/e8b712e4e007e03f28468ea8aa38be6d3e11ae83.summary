@entity0 has confirmed that @entity1 is fit to face @entity2 on saturday			1
the striker has not played since coming back from international duty with @entity5 struggling with persistent hamstring problems			2
he has missed @entity8 's past four games , but the Â£ 32million summer signing is set to return against @entity2			1
' that 's good for us			0
it 's difficult , when only one striker available			0
when you have two , obviously the situation improves			0
' we do n't have @entity27 , it 's not good for us			1
he 's always an option			0
but the fact we recover @entity31 is a compensation for that loss			1
so the situation is a bit better			0
' and @entity0 insisted that the striker would continue to be allowed to go on international duty , despite his injury problems			1
@entity0 has been rowing with @entity5 national team coach @entity39 in recent weeks			1
the @entity41 was not happy that @entity1 came back from international duty injured but @entity39 has hit back saying he will remain stubborn by playing the striker			2
@entity0 , however , will not stand in his @entity1 's way of joining up with the @entity5 team in future			1
he added : ' the only thing i can say is what everybody knows , which is the time he was having problems in @entity8 and the way we managed to keep him playing , but after the national team we lost him for four matches			2
@entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
' @entity60 matches in three different competitions			0
now he 's again available , but he needs obviously to be again under special care			0
we are going to do that			0
it 's the only thing we can do , nothing else			0
' @entity15 's goal against @entity69 on tuesday night was his third in three competitions last week @entity0 praised his @entity73 striker , who ' can show his importance by being there when the team need him ' @entity1 was injured on @entity5 duty , but @entity0 insisted he will not stop players going on international duty @entity80 will hope to resume his deadly partnership with his international team - mate @entity82 @entity1 's return is likely to mean a rest for @entity15 , who filled in for @entity1 in the summer signing 's absence			1
@entity15 was the subject of continued praise from his manager , after scoring in three consecutive games			1
@entity0 said the @entity73 striker had demonstrated that he ' can show his importance by being there when the team need him '			2
and with @entity95 still missing until after the next international break , @entity15 will almost certainly still have some part to play			2
@entity95 could be available to return after the international break , but wo n't be fit this week @entity95 injured his groin scoring in the @entity100 against @entity57 , the first goal in a 6 - 0 win			1

@entity1 has n't played since scoring in 2 - 0 win over @entity105
*midfielder* @entity31 also declared fit by manager @entity0
@entity0 also praised @entity15 's *performances* in @entity1 's absence
