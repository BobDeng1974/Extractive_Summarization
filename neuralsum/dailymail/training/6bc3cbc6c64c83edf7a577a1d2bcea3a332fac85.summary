lucky her ! the @entity1 has received hundreds of gifts in her @entity3 year - from jewellery to a @entity6 dog bed in the shape of a crown she is , surely , the woman who has everything			1
so just what should one have given the @entity1 for her @entity3 ? the answer , it turns out , is anything from 60 pieces of onyx and ancient @entity17 silver jewellery to a dog bed for her corgis in the shape of a crown			0
there was also a 1950s @entity25 compact from @entity27 president @entity26 and his wife @entity28 , two park benches courtesy of the @entity30 – and a baby llama , which is now happily residing in a zoo somewhere			0
the details were included in a list , obtained by the @entity35 , of gifts presented to members of the royal family last year			1
while some given to the @entity1 were distinctly weird and wonderful , two presented to prince @entity39 are likely to raise eyebrows for the wrong reasons – a valuable ornamental sword and a box of caviar , courtesy of the billionaire despot who rules @entity47			2
the prince formed close links with president @entity50 through his role as a trade envoy			0
the disclosure will add to growing disquiet over the prince ’s relationships with leaders of dubious regimes			0
while @entity39 resigned from his post as a trade ambassador in 2011 , he attended several previously arranged engagements last year – and received some generous gifts as a result			1
prince @entity64 of the @entity66 royal family gave him a painting , while the president of @entity69 gave him an ornamental gold string instrument			2
giving and receiving gifts is considered to be an important part of the royal family ’s work in developing good relations with other countries			1
courtiers are supposed to discourage the offering of presents of high monetary value – although this often does n’t work in reality			2
last year , as befitting her @entity3 celebration , the @entity1 received several lavish pieces of jewellery and valuable trinkets			2
but many of the hundreds of gifts she received came unsolicited from members of the public , including a wickerwork throne and a model of the state coach made from an ostrich egg			1
not your usual birthday presents : @entity1 was given a box of @entity99 medals by president of @entity102 @entity101 and a baby llama by a member of the public in all , according to @entity108 , members of the public gave her 436 books , 235 cds and dvds , 81 pieces of embroidery or knitting , 78 self - portraits , 40 digital photograph books , 28 wall hangings , 19 tea towels and nine jigsaws			2
the @entity120 did n’t miss out , either			1
he received – rather oddly – a set of @entity124 binoculars for his 91st birthday , among other gifts			1
the lists released yesterday do not include those of @entity129 , the @entity130 or the @entity120 and @entity131 , who compile theirs separately			1
from the president of @entity69 there was an ornamental gold string instrument and from the president of @entity136 three boxes , once again descriptions of which are not included			0
feather headdress and a gold sword : the @entity141 , left , and @entity120 were also lavished with gifts - but royals are now strictly barred from selling or exchanging presents helpfully , given his love of the game , he was also gifted a golf pitch repairer from an admiring member of the public and a luxury @entity152 case worth around £ 250			1
the @entity1 receives dozens in the course of her official duties but most are of historical value or small , well - meaning gifts from members of the public			2
last year , as befitting her @entity3 celebration , she received several lavish pieces of jewellery and valuable trinkets including two silver café au lait pots from @entity164 , a @entity166 wrist watch and a boxed set of gold , silver and bronze @entity99 medals – as well as her own laminated olympic park security pass			2
many of the hundreds she received , however , came unsolicited from members of the public including her own wickerwork throne , a model of the state coach made from an ostrich eggs , and a knitted tea cosy featuring herself and the corgis			0
in all , according to @entity108 , members of the public gave her : 436 books , 235 cds and dvds , 81 pieces of embroidery or knitting , 78 self - portraits , 40 digital photograph books , 28 wall hangings or bunting , 19 tea towels and nine jigsaws			0
other gifts included honorary ownership of a baby llama and the adoption of a baby @entity200 elephant			0
the @entity120 , bizarrely , got a set of @entity124 binoculars for his 91st birthday , while @entity205 received , among hundreds of relatively small gifts , a set of spurs and a horse blanker			1
the @entity120 and @entity210 picked up an @entity211 by @entity212 on a trip to @entity214 and complimentary membership of @entity216 in @entity217			1
the @entity141 , who the @entity35 revealed was controversially given two lavish sets of jewels by the despotic @entity221 royal family in 2011 , was once again on the receiving end of some fabulous pieces			0
the @entity224 gave her a necklace , earrings and a ring last november while her husband , @entity228 , was given a designer watch			0
officially , the jewels are not considered to be her personal property , even if she wears them regularly			0
if they were , she would have to pay tax on them			0
on her death they must , ostensibly at least , be passed on to the monarch , who will then decide whether they should be handed over to the @entity239 or lent to her successors			0
regulations regarding the classification of royal gifts were brought in after it emerged that prince @entity129 had personally pocketed £ 23,000 from secretly selling on a number of the gifts he received from wealthy benefactors through his trusted valet @entity250 , dubbed @entity251			1
it also emerged that he regularly handed over less valuable items to members of his household , who also went on to profit from them			0
since then , members of the @entity258 have been barred from selling or exchanging gifts			1
each one received must be logged and either used by the receiver , displayed in one of the royal palaces or stored in one of their warehouses and should be traceable at all times			0
mangoes and crocodile teeth : royal presents received this year share certificate featuring painting of the queen			1
