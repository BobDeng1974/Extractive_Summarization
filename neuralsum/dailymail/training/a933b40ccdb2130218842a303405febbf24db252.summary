by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:18 est , 21 july 2012 updated : 23:17 est , 21 july 2012 accused : @entity2 , 57 , pictured in 2009 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity5 five years after he became an object of national scorn , former policeman @entity2 is about to go on trial on charges that he murdered @entity5 in 2004			1
he has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for her death , and is the chief suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife @entity14 , who has never been found			1
the case , which begins monday with jury selection , is sure to rekindle memories of the media frenzy that engulfed @entity2 before his arrest , when he often joked with an army of news crews camped outside his house and even invited @entity23 into his kitchen			1
reporters from around the country and maybe from as far away as @entity27 will descend on a courthouse in @entity29 to watch the latest chapter of a story that has already spawned a couple of books and a cable tv movie starring @entity35 as @entity2			2
the frenetic coverage ' absolutely has the possibility of reigniting , ' said @entity39 , a prominent @entity40 defence attorney who has been at the centre of comparable firestorms , including when he represented @entity43 ( no relation ) , a @entity40 man convicted of murdering his young wife and unborn child			0
prosecutors expect to tell a relatively simple story : @entity2 killed his ex-wife to keep her from making off with much of his money in a contentious divorce			1
sometime around february 29 , 2004 , according to the indictment , @entity2 went to @entity54 's house and in the bathroom caused her ' to inhale fluid , ' killing her			2
earlier days : former @entity57 police sergeant @entity2 talks to the media as he leaves his home in @entity57 , @entity60 in 2007 in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity5 , the third wife of @entity2 , at the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity60 observers say @entity2 may benefit from the three years he 's been behind bars and out of the public eye , if only because he spent much of the past three years in solitary confinement , with his only human contact being from guards bringing him meals			1
' he really was becoming one of the more hated individuals in @entity78 , ' @entity74 , a prominent defence attorney in @entity75 , told the @entity79 ' because he was in jail , he took himself off the front page , and that can only help him with a jury pool			0
' @entity2 's attorney agreed			2
' nobody 's going to deny that @entity2 's relatively goofy behaviour rubbed people the wrong way , ' said @entity89 , who explained @entity2 's actions as both the by - product of a sometimes grim job and his way of moving on after his wife left him			1
' the fact that he has n't been at that for a period of years certainly helps some of his past antics fade from memory			2
' but that simple story is complicated by what happened after @entity54 's body was discovered by a friend of @entity2 's			0
@entity2 had called the friend to the house to look for @entity54 , saying he was worried			0
the investigation unfolded nothing like the ones jurors may have seen on television programs such as ' csi ' and ' @entity111			0
' grave charges : @entity2 is accused of murdering @entity5 , left			1
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide detectives are expected to testify , as they did at a hearing in 2010 , that nobody collected a single fingerprint or hair fibre at the house			0
they will likely acknowledge that @entity54 's relatives , who could have told investigators about the couple 's on - going battles , were never interviewed			0
jurors may also hear , as a judge did at the 2010 hearing , that @entity2 was allowed to sit in on a police interview with @entity132 as a ' professional courtesy			1
' this happened while officers were trying to confirm @entity2 's whereabouts the weekend @entity54 died			0
the one - time policeman of the year , told a reporter at the @entity139 : ' i â€™m sick of being called sinister			0
' instead he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with women was not his fault - it was because he picked ' women who changed after getting married			1
' missing : @entity2 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity132 , right authorities then reopened the investigation into the march 2004 death of his third wife @entity5 , who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her bathtub			1
but it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle			0
@entity2 was arrested and charged with her death in may 2009 and is being held on $ 20million bail			1
during the 30 minute interview in the jail 's visitor centre , @entity2 spoke about his children claiming to be a good father			0
he said his sons with @entity5 , @entity169 and @entity170 , had never asked him if he had killed their mother because they knew he had not			2
he also said that he told his youngest children , @entity173 and @entity174 , that their mother @entity14 was on vacation			0
they are currently being looked after by one of his son 's from his first marriage - @entity2 has six children from three of his four marriages			2
when asked if he missed @entity14 he said he did sometimes , but said if she did reappear the first thing he would do is ' ask her to sign the divorce papers			1
' taken in : police lt. @entity184 , left , and a fellow investigator escort @entity2 , centre , into @entity186 state police headquarters in 2009 times past : @entity2 , pictured on his motorcycle two months before his indictment in 2009 , left , and right , with missing fourth wife @entity132 he said his last girlfriend @entity190 has asked him to marry her three years ago , but he had not seen her since she had become intimidated by the press			1
last year it emerged that @entity2 had written a dozen jail - house love letters from jail , repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since she was 14			2
@entity196 , now 40 , said the former @entity60 police sergeant has been plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests , like asking for her measurements , photos of her in a bikini as well as describing what he wants to do to her in bed			0
he also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases			0
in letters , obtained by the @entity206 , he wrote to her : ' i just think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body against mine ... i want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours			0
' i like sex with a lot of foreplay , i 'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others			0
' @entity2 spoke to @entity223 about the disappearance of his fourth wife , sticking to his story that she walked out on him , saying she could have all her clothes			1
family : during the interview @entity2 claimed he was very close with his two children he had with his third wife , @entity54 : @entity169 and @entity170			1

@entity2 , 57 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity5
chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity132
