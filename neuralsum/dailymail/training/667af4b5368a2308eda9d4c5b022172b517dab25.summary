by @entity0 a new app allows users to assess their love life at a glance by highlighting positive and negative patterns on a color - coded calendar			1
users of @entity8 are instructed to write a brief sentence summarizing how they feel about their relationship each day , marking it green for ' amazing ' , orange for ' happy ' , blue for ' sad ' and red for ' angry			0
' if their calendar shows more red than green , the app 's creator , 49 - year - old @entity14 , says it 's probably time to call it quits and find someone who will have a more positive impact			1
she said over the years there were lots of signs that something was wrong , but she chose to ignore them and remember happier times			1
helping others : the @entity41 instructs users to rate how they feel about their relationship each day using colors - it was invented by @entity14 , 49 , who was devastated when her husband of 19 years left her when she found herself dating again for the first time in her mid-forties , she said she was determined to create something that would help her to ' visualize the patterns ' easily			1
in a @entity52 video promoting her app - which was downloaded 359 times in less than a week when it launched on april 30 - ms @entity14 tells viewers that ' seeing is believing ' and ' clarity is queen			1
' source of inspiration : ms @entity14 's ex-husband , @entity32 , who cheated on her she continues : ' this time i was accountable to the patterns , i could trust myself to be my own eye - witness			2
when the next relationship came around , truth was on my side			0
' ms @entity14 , who also works as an author , has now been with another man for about four years - and she credits @entity8 for that relationship 's success			1

' this app does that in a way that makes things very clear			0
and using it is really easy			0
thank you for making it ! ' and another said that they had been using it to rate their progress at work : ' i am in sales and rating my behavior for the day , ’ they wrote			0
