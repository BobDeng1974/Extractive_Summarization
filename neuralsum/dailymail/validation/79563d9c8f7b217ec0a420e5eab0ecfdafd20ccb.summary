former @entity3 international and @entity2 striker @entity0 is an expert analyst and commentator for @entity5 ’ coverage of @entity8 football			1
here , he shares his thoughts with @entity11 's @entity10 on the @entity13 saga at @entity14 … @entity13 is under a lot of pressure and sometimes that can get to you			1
but the recent criticism aimed at him is completely unfounded and unnecessary			0
i have seen him play really well this season and i have seen him play some indifferent games			0
he is probably having a decent season , but it could still be brilliant			0
real are only four points behind @entity27 in the league and you would fancy them to get past @entity31 and into the last four of the @entity32			1
@entity13 was heavily criticised after @entity14 's 2 - 1 defeat at the hands of @entity35 rivals @entity27 an estimated 400 million people watched @entity13 struggle on television as @entity2 moved four points behind @entity27 @entity13 has been criticised by @entity2 supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 and do n’t forget what an impact he had last year			1
he scored in the final of the @entity32 and @entity46 and finished with 22 goals			0
he 's on 16 now and will better that total this year , what more can you ask ? all this talk of dropping him is rubbish – you ca n’t drop @entity13 , he scores and creates too many goals			1
@entity2 have been going through a slump in the past five weeks or so			1
they have been missing key players			0
but it seems @entity13 has been taking a lot of the stick from fans , and i do n’t agree with that , although he has probably been trying too hard at times			2
now that @entity65 and @entity66 are back i think you ’ll see @entity13 really re-emerge and rediscover his best form , because i admit he was n’t great against @entity27 on sunday			1
he was n’t the only top player to disappoint , but he disappeared from the game for long periods and sometimes he needs to be more forceful			0
the @entity73 international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against @entity77 on march 15 cracks seem to be appearing in @entity13 's relationship with @entity14 team - mate @entity80 on the issue of him being unhappy , only he knows how happy he really is at @entity14			1
part of the problem is the language and being comfortable with your team - mates			0
then there is the situation with @entity80			2
i would n’t say the relationship between himself and @entity80 is bad , but @entity80 was so petulant when @entity13 scored his goals against @entity77 last week - he could not hide the disappointment from his face			1
he ’s like a spoilt brat at times			0
but the fans are so forgiving with @entity80 because of the goals he scores , it ’s very unfair			2
they say @entity13 should pass more to @entity80 - that ’s nonsense			1
it was the same with @entity102 and the pressure on him to pass to @entity104 at @entity27			2
as say @entity2 ' missed and they paid for it ' while @entity108 highlight @entity14 's misses during the @entity35 match i would like to see @entity13 say , “ i ’m better than all of this ” and prove how good he is on the pitch - and i think he will because he has got great ability			1
he ’s got everything - he scores goals and creates them , he ’s brilliant in the air , he strong , he ’s fast , he ’s aggressive			2
for me , he ’s very close to being right up there with @entity104 and @entity80			2
there is talk of him going to @entity122 , but it would be a huge mistake on @entity2 ’s part if they agreed to sell him			1
if i was him though i ’d keep my options open and see how i feel at the end of the season			0
but i think he will still be at @entity14 next season			0
this will blow over given a few goals and the team clicking again			0
in a few weeks ’ time i ’d bet we ’ll be having completely different discussions about @entity13 and all of this will be forgotten .			0
