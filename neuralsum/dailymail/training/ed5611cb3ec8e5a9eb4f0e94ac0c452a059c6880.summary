by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 will be given a chance to prove his @entity5 fitness as he eyes a @entity5 debut against @entity8			1
the defender is yet to feature in the @entity10 for @entity5 after suffering a knee injury in pre-season but is in line to play against @entity14 in an under - 21 friendly on tuesday			1
@entity2 , who moved on a free after leaving @entity15 in the summer , could be joined by fellow new boys @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 who all lack fitness			1
on the mend : @entity2 is in line to make his @entity5 debut against @entity8 test : @entity2 suffered a knee injury during pre-season but will use @entity14 friendly to prove his fitness a return would be a huge boost ahead of the @entity5 ' home game with @entity8 on saturday after centre - back @entity31 limped out of @entity34 's 2 - 1 win in @entity35 on sunday			1
' we 've got an under - 21 friendly here on tuesday and i would love to be able to play players in that game who need to play			2
ideally i would want to be including all of them , ' head coach @entity42 told the club 's official site			0
not wanted : @entity47 defender was deemed surplus to requirements at @entity15 @entity50 ! @entity51 could also feature in the closed game against @entity14 after playing for @entity53 ' it is scheduled as an under - 21 friendly but i think with @entity14 's five signings on deadline day and us trying to get players bedded in , i would think it will end up being a game for a whole load of players that @entity63 ( @entity64 , @entity14 manager ) does n't know very well and i do n't know very well			2
' it 's fairly star - studded but they need it , several have not done a pre-season			0
there 's a lot of players who need training and games and also get to need to get to know one other			0
' @entity75 may also play after he lasted 45 minutes of @entity78 's 1 - 0 @entity77 qualifier defeat to @entity79 on sunday and @entity51 , who played in @entity53 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity81 as he continued his recovery from a knee injury , is pencilled in .			0
