@entity0 has endured a decade of pain because of his two - stone leg a pensioner who has been branded a modern day ' elephant man ' has been given fresh hope for treatment of his debilitating disease			1
@entity0 , 66 , has endured a decade of pain after his left leg ballooned to more than two stone in weight , leaving him incapable of walking and making him the target of cruel taunts from strangers			1
the retired @entity17 computer technician from @entity18 , @entity19 , accused the @entity20 of turning its back on him earlier this year after being told there was nothing that could be done to treat his condition			1
but he is now optimistic that he might finally be on the brink of a life - changing operation after being referred to a specialist in the north of @entity30			2
he said doctors in @entity32 were discussing surgery to remove the deformed tissue from his lower leg and return it to a more manageable size			1
' i am absolutely elated that all these years of pain may be coming to an end , ' he said			2
' it looks like i 'll be going to @entity32 for the operation - it ca n't come soon enough for me			1
finally , things are being put in place			2
' as far as i know , it 's a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue on the lower part of my leg			1
' it will mean a big improvement to my life , it will bring things back to normality			2
this would be devastating , as his condition means he finds doing regular things like cooking , taking a bath or going up stairs extremely difficult			1
it looks like mr @entity0 's nightmare could finally be over , because specialists believe surgery can treat him mr @entity0 can not board a plane , and finds regular things like cooking , taking a bath and going up stairs very hard his nightmare started after a car accident while he was living in @entity74			1
despite attempts to halt the growth of his leg with stockings after he moved to @entity55 , it continued to swell			1
the condition has now spread from his toes up to his hip , leaving his leg lumpy and deformed			1
it was only after he contacted first minister @entity84 directly that he was referred to a consultant in @entity86 last year			2
it was suggested he had elephantiasis , a disease found in third world countries , and is the stage of lymphedema at which the lymph channels are almost completely blocked			1
mr @entity0 says he rarely leaves his home in because he was in so much discomfort - and when he did he was often the butt of ' @entity98 ' jokes in the street			1
' people call me all sorts of things , like @entity98			2
it makes me really depressed , ' he said			2
' my trousers ride up when i walk so there is no way i can hide it			0
it affects my leg , foot , and toes			1
i ca n’t wear socks because i ca n’t get them on			0
' but he added that previous press attention means he was glad he had spoken out			0
' people have been a lot nicer , more friendly , they have been a lot more understanding , ' he said			0
' i think it has made the medical professionals move a little bit quicker , too			0
' he said he hoped to hear from his doctor again in the next week and expects to travel for surgery in the next month			1
' i still do n't know what it is			0
i think , after all this time , i 'd like an answer to that , too , ' he said			0
' my message to anyone else suffering from a condition like mine is to make a nuisance of yourself , keep on top of the doctors			1
' i see some of these other procedures people have on the @entity20 - cosmetic surgery and the like - and i just think that is totally wrong when i had to wait for so many years			1
' mr @entity0 's leg is currently so big that he can not even board a plane , as the seat space is too narrow for his leg , but now he is able to look to the future			1
' i plan on doing a bit of travelling when i 'm all fixed up			0
i 've been stuck here for so long that i just ca n't wait to get going again , ' he said			0
elephantiasis is normally caused by a parasite from a mosquito bite and is usually found in tropical parts of the world , like @entity155 or the @entity156 , where mr @entity0 grew up			1
it is characterised by massive enlargement of an area of the body and is caused by the obstruction of the lymphatic system			0
this results in the accumulation of fluids in the affected part of the body			0
according to the @entity170 , nearly 1.4billion people in 73 countries worldwide are threatened by the condition , which is also known as lymphatic filariasis			2
@entity170 figures suggest that approximately 80 per cent of these people are living in @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity155 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and the @entity183 of @entity184			2
over 120million people are currently infected , with about 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease , the organisation claims			0
the most famous person to suffer from a form of elephantiasis was @entity191 , better known as the @entity98			0
in 1884 , after four years in a workhouse , @entity191 contacted a showman and proposed that he should exhibit him			0
his managers then named him @entity98 and he was eventually sent on a tour of @entity197			0
he returned to @entity198 and became well known in @entity74 society after he went to live at the @entity200			0
@entity191 died in 1890 , aged 27			0
it is reported he died from a dislocated neck when he lay down to sleep , because of the huge weight of his head .			0

@entity0 , 66 , has been living in agony for a decade with condition
has been subject of cruel taunts from strangers and stayed *indoors*
he *blames* the @entity20 for letting the condition get to this stage
specialists in @entity32 believe they can give him surgery to treat his leg
but mr @entity0 is @entity55 , so may not get treatment because of independence
