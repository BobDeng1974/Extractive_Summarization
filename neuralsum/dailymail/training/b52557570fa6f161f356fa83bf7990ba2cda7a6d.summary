search vessels has reached its designated site in the southern @entity3 to join the deep sea search and solve the missing @entity5			1
the @entity6 has arrived at @entity7 in @entity8 , where the aircraft is believed to have crashed with 239 people on board			1
crews are preparing to resume the sonar searches of the sea floor , more than 1,500 kilometres off the @entity8 coast on monday with high - tech equipment and video cameras			1
experts believe the plane crashed somewhere in the area after veering off course from it 's @entity22 to @entity24 flight on 8 march			1
meanwhile the @entity25 arrived on sunday and will start about 12 days of sonar surveys , according to the @entity27			1
a bathymetric survey currently underway is focussed on gathering more detailed and higher resolution data in preparation for the underwater search phase the @entity41 says the vessel will conduct operations in the area for about 12 days before sailing to @entity45 to be resupplied			1
@entity46 , which is surveying the search area , is likely to be used as a search vessel when its bathymetric work finishes later this month			2
more than 111,000 square kilometres of the search area has been analysed and mapped so far			1
a massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane			2
@entity30 , the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search , departed @entity58 , @entity59 more than a week ago , after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter			1
chief commissioner from the @entity66 says the vessel is likely to arrive late sunday			0
' when they get going , they will deploy an underwater sonar in on the end of very long cable , eight kilometres , they will tow that sonar in on a toefish , which contains sonar equipoment , close to ocean floor , 100 metres , ' he said			0
' they send out sonar signals , get them back , a width of about 1.5 kms , that will go up the cable to vessel and crews to look and anaylise for anything for interest			0
' ' it will be recorded and transferred in batches , re-anaylised so nothing to be missed			0
' the new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys , which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern @entity3 , where it 's believed to have run out of fuel			2
the primary search area - dubbed the ' priority area ' - is an arc 23,000 square miles ( 60,000 square kilometres ) in size , roughly the size of @entity101 , 1,120 miles ( 1,800km ) off the @entity8 coast			1
' three things that make it complicated is that we know aircraft will be found there but have to prioritise high probability areas , ' said @entity109			0
' also towing expensive equipment , we need to know closely what the ocean floor is like , the sea floor is quite complex , not just a simple matter , additional attention is needed for some areas to cover them properly			0
' ' lastly data itself requires a specialised eye to understand , so we also have the capacity to review			0
' the chief also mentioned the weather conditions , which can be quite challenging because it is so unpredictable			0
images from the bathymetric survey being conducted in the latest @entity5 search area : they provide information including the contours , depths and hardness of the ocean floor to ensure the safe and effective operation of equipment in the search these images show remnants of volcanoes , towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named @entity144 , an extensive linear , mountainous sea floor structure ' weather is improving and the course of this month is as good as it gets , make the searching as easy as possible but still big swells , storm will come through			1
' vessels will also be joining @entity30 including @entity153 which has completed fit out works in @entity155 , @entity156 and is en - route to @entity8 where it is expected to arrive in @entity45 on sunday			1
@entity158 , the vessel currently being used to survey the search area , is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of october			2
' the second vessel , @entity158 will be there about the end of the third week of this month , the @entity164 in @entity165 by the end of the month to do its first underwater search			0
this bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level ( purple ) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level ( red ) very few marine surveys have taken place in the @entity5 search area			1
previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth ' it 's not clear how long that search will take , ' transport minister @entity184 said , according to the @entity187			0
` we would hope , obviously , to find the aircraft on the first day , but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact			2
' the chief commissioner said there are several ' high probability ' areas located that will be searched in the southern arc of the @entity3			0
' the second vessel will go to another high probability area and the third vessel will work between those two areas , ' he said			2
the area being searched for @entity5 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc ( grey ) in the southern @entity3 , 1800km off the @entity8 coast the yellow markings represent the area surveyed via bathymetric surveys ' until we have more solid data in flight data by boxes no one will be able to come to form a view , people will speculate			1
' ' we want to givce some certainty of closure to families			0
the current plan is scheduled to take up to a year but we hope we wo n't need that			0
' ' there are no guarantees			0
' the search operation is a joint effort by @entity8 and @entity31 costing $ 57 million			1
there has been many theories as to what happened to the @entity5 but there 's been increased interest on the pilot , @entity231 who reportedly used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island .			2

two search vessels have arrived in @entity8
high - tech equipment is expected to join the search zone on monday
the area , 1,500 kilometres off the @entity8 coast , is thought to be where @entity31 *airlines* flight @entity5 crashed in march
@entity30 will run conduct operations for 12 days before returning to port for resupply
it will be joined by two other vessels in coming days
the search operation is a joint effort by @entity8 and @entity31 costing $ 57 million
