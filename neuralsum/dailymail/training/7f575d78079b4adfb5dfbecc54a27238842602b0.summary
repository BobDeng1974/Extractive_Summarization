burning : @entity1 's skin weeps and burns following an allergic reaction to hair dye a mum was left terrified and fighting for her life after suffering an allergic reaction to a bottle of hair dye			1
@entity1 , 29 , ended up in a hospital high - dependency unit after using a bottle of Â£ 5.99 @entity12 in @entity13			1
just hours after applying it to her hair , miss @entity1 's scalp began to weep with pus and her skin started to itch uncontrollably			1
but this was just the beginning of her problems as over a 48 - hour period her symptoms deteriorated to a life - threatening degree			1
her throat closed up , she struggled to breathe and her heart rate jumped to a dangerous 180 beats per minute			1
miss @entity1 , who started going grey in her early 20s , decided to dye her hair ahead of a trip from her home of @entity30 , @entity31 , to see her fiance @entity33 's family in @entity34 , @entity35			1
the night before she was due to leave , she applied a bottle of @entity12 in @entity13 to her hair which she had purchased from her local @entity37			1
she said : ' i started going grey when i was quite young so i had used other dyes in the past for years and i thought i would be fine			1
' before i went to bed , i felt some slight itching and my head was a bit uncomfortable			2
but then it just started getting worse and worse			2
' there was yellow pus oozing from my scalp and it had the most horrific smell of burning flesh			1
' i knew straightaway that was from the dye but at that point i did n't panic , i just took some anti-histamines and put some @entity55 on my hairline , where it was starting to blister , before i went to sleep			2
' before and after : the horrific effects of the allergic reaction to the hair dye can be seen in these pictures however , the next morning , miss @entity1 faced the long drive to @entity34 with unpleasant pus running down her face			1
too ashamed to show her appearance in public , she hid in the car while her fiance , @entity70 , 42 , a managing director , and children @entity72 , 12 , and @entity73 , six , visited service stations en route			2
however , by the time the party reached @entity34 , it was clear that @entity78 , a council worker , required urgent medical attention			2
she said : ' during the journey , i was getting gradually worse all the time			2
' both my eyes swelled up and the skin at the side of my earlobes was really swollen and itchy			0
' the worst part was the awful pus that was still oozing from my head all the time			1
worried : @entity1 's face swells as the allergic reaction takes hold ' we went to @entity93 and i was seen pretty quickly , but at that point , because the reaction was still relatively slight , i was sent home with some anti-histamines and told to keep an eye on it			0
' that night , miss @entity1 awoke in a panic to find her whole face was swollen and her cheeks had puffed out to double their size			0
she returned to @entity93 only to be told to keep taking her medication , but just three hours later she went back to the hospital with a racing heartbeart and shortness of breath and was immediately admitted			0
she said : ' @entity33 dropped me off at the front door and went to park the car			0
' the first nurse who set eyes on me exclaimed " @entity115 , this woman is having a terrible reaction " , and by the time @entity33 came in i was strapped to a heart monitor on a trolley			1
' my heart rate was at 180 bpm - around the same rate as a heart attack - and i could n't breathe			1
' my eyelids had swelled completely shut and i could n't see			0
' i was really panicking by this point and even the nurses seemed shocked			0
' i was admitted to the high dependency unit and pumped full of anti-histamines and steroid injections			0
' it was awful as in the bed next to me there was someone receiving the last rites - i was so scared			1
' by this point my skin was actually starting to bruise because it was so swollen			0
' miss @entity1 spent a further three days in hospital during the time of the incident in january this year			1
reaction : a packet of @entity13 which @entity1 used before her allergic reaction one of the doctors asked her if she had ever heard of the chemical ppd			1
an ingredient in many @entity144 hair dyes , para-phenylenediamine ( @entity141 ) is a common allergen banned in many @entity148 countries			1
people can become allergic to it at any time , even if they have been exposed to it before without problems			0
for this reason , it was voted @entity155 in 2006 by the @entity155			0
miss @entity1 said : ' when he told me it was banned in so many countries i was shocked			2
' he told me to check with my gp once i got home to see if that 's what was responsible for my reaction and it turned out it was			0
' afterwards i found out it 's contained in all sorts of things , from textiles to cosmetics			0
' i feel very strongly that @entity141 should be banned in the @entity144			1
' i did n't do a patch test but i had used dyes with @entity141 in them for years without any problems and i know i am not the only person who does n't do the test every time they dye their hair			1
' it 's horrifying to think it could be in my clothes or in a tube of mascara and i would be none the wiser			0
' now that i have had the reaction once , i will always be allergic to @entity141 and another reaction could kill me			0
' i now have to dye my hair with a semi-permanent dye i order from a health food shop '			2
' more people need to know the risks of @entity141 so they do n't have to go through what i went through			0
' a spokesman for @entity12 said : ' we are totally committed to ensuring that our products are safe and that our customers can use them with absolute confidence			0
' we were very sorry to hear of ms @entity1 's experience in january			0
' ms @entity1 has not contacted @entity12 and we would encourage her to do so , so that we can offer specialist medical support			0
' ' a helpline number is provided on all our products and we always offer our support when consumers contact us			0
' allergies to hair colourants are extremely rare but can occur for a very small number of people			2
' ms @entity1 's experience shows how important it is to carry out a skin allergy test at least 48 hours before using the colourant each and every time , following the instructions exactly , which are clearly displayed on @entity217 hair colour packaging			2
