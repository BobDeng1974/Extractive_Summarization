@entity0 , which hit the @entity1 with winds of up to 195 mph , was so powerful that it rolled a boulder weighing more than 26 adult male african elephants up a beach for 150 feet			1
it is the largest rock to be moved by a storm ever recorded , according to scientists who examined huge piles of debris deposited by the typhoon in the island of @entity13 in 2013			1
@entity0 , which is one of the most powerful tropical cyclones on record , killed more than 6,000 people , devastated more than a million homes and caused widespread destruction as it swept across the @entity1 in november last year			0
now researchers from the @entity30 and the @entity31 , said the category five storm was so powerful that the waves it created dislodged some of the most massive boulders to be recorded			1
the largest weighed , around 198 ton ( 180 tonnes ) and was rolled 150 feet ( 45 metres ) up a slope of a beach on the south east coast of @entity13			1
measuring more than 29.5 feet long ( 9 metres ) and 14.7 feet wide ( 4.5 metres ) , it was almost the same size as the largest animal on the planet , a blue whale			0
dr @entity46 and his colleagues from the @entity30 used satellite images taken before and after the typhoon to identify areas where boulders may have moved			0
they found another boulder weighing around 77 tons ( 70 tonnes ) was thrown 150 feet by the storm surge while a 25.9 ton ( 23.5 tonnes ) boulder was torn from a cliff face and carried almost 20 feet above level			1
several other boulders of around 18.7 tons ( 17 tonnes ) were carried so far that they were finally dropped inland at heights of around 40 feet above sea level			0
the researchers found distinctive marks on the rock that showed they had been moved by the storm , including downward facing rock pools and patches of grass on the bottom sides of the boulder			0
the researchers discovered several large boulders had been carried up the beach by the storm waves the storm was so powerful that sea water carried huge quantities of debris inland as it surged up the coast @entity13 in central @entity78 were among the most badly hit by typhoon @entity0 in november 2013 dr @entity46 , who presented the findings at the fall meeting of the @entity82 , said that it appeared the typhoon created protracted tsunami - like waves that pushed the enormous rocks up the beach			1
in a paper titled ' storm surge of super typhoon @entity0 on @entity92 moved the largest boulder ever documented for a recent storm ' , he said : ' downward - facing rock pools , grass patches , living barnacles , roots and soil staining on exposed former bottom sides , and fresh wood jammed under the rocks provide unambiguous evidence for sub-recent transport and overturning			1
' we conclude that the geological legacy of @entity0 calls for a careful reconsideration of possible storm surge transport where boulders , based on their size , previously associated with tsunami impacts and storms , have been ruled out to be the cause			2
' he added : ' we currently think that storm surge was not the main process shifting the boulders but another long - wave phenomenon that is evolving from groups of extremely high and steep regular storm waves when interacting with the coral reef			2
' this phenomenon obviously caused a tens of seconds to minute - long one - directional high - velocity flow in the area capable of transporting the giant boulders			2
' the wave phenomenon has characteristics of a tsunami , but it is by no means a tsunami			0
' scientists from the @entity132 in @entity133 also found @entity0 ripped rocks from reefs that line the coastline of @entity92			0
they found a 99 ton ( 90 tonnes ) boulder and several others weighing more than 66 tons ( 60 tonnes ) had been dislodged from reef platforms close to @entity140 on the @entity141 of eastern @entity13			2
@entity142 , who lead the @entity132 team , said : ' the large clasts on the @entity145 provide further evidence that storm waves are capable of quarrying and transporting very large clasts			0
' the boulders were found on the south east coast of @entity13 , which was badly hit by @entity0 in 2013 the boulder is the biggest rock proven to have been moved by waves during a storm surge or tsunami @entity0 was a category five storm and is one of the most powerful tropical cyclones on record winds of 145mph created waves that measured up to 16 feet as typhoon @entity0 swept across the @entity1			1

@entity165 was rolled 150 feet up a beach in south east @entity13 in @entity1
giant rock weighed around 198 tons , more than 26 @entity170 elephants
scientists believe super typhoon @entity0 created a prolonged ' tsunami - like ' wave that lasted for up to a minute and dislodged giant boulders
geologists have found storm tore up several other massive boulders
