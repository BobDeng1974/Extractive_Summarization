by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 14 january 2013 it started off as a prank that bemused a few embarrassed commuters but has since grown into a global phenomenon			0
and despite the threat of snow and bleak midwinter temperatures many hardy thrill seekers braved bracing conditions and took to the @entity10 today to take part in the @entity12 2013			1
it was all part of the @entity15 's 13th annual celebration of riding the world 's underground without trousers , with commuters in @entity10 joining their counterparts from dozens of cities around the globe to venture out minus their breeches			1
participants behave as if they do not know each other and - other than the lack of trousers - dress appropriately for winter donning hats , scarfs and a warm coat			0
the hilarious craze started back in 2002 when a handful of @entity64 pranksters decided to cause a stir on a @entity67 train			2
one participant entered the train in just his underwear for seven consecutive stops and , if asked , were instructed to tell people that they ' just forgot ' their trousers			0
acting normally : those who take part are told to go about their everyday business and pretend not to know each other say cheese : other fully - clothed commuters take pictures of fellow passengers who are just in their pants on a packed @entity86 train untrussed @entity87 : commuters in @entity89 , @entity90 , also took to the train minus their trousers @entity94 weather : passengers about to board the @entity96 earlier today in comfortably warm temperatures confused : passengers were bemused by less than fully - dressed commuters at a rail station in @entity101 colourful : some dressed in garish underwear as they removed their trousers to take part in the @entity15 in @entity101 today on the 8th stop , a final participant would enter the carriage selling trousers out of a duffle bag - much to the bemusement of other passengers			1
the annual event steadily grew each year with more and more people choosing to take part			0
but it nearly hit the buffers in 2006 when the stunt was halted by a @entity64 policeman			0
eight passengers were handcuffed in their underwear and taken into police custody			0
a judge later threw out the case because it is not illegal to wear just your underwear on the @entity67			2
surprise : passengers on a @entity130 train look startled as one passenger , complete with warm jumper and wooly hat takes off his shoes and trousers quizzed : two passengers are highly amused by the prank while another two men ask the trouser-less traveller what he is up to untrussed : passengers on a @entity130 subway train might have their umbrellas to protect them from the rain , but they are likely to get wet legs without their trousers startling : onlookers watch as two girls chat nonchalantly on a @entity130 train earlier today the @entity15 event went global in 2008 with @entity152 in @entity90 joining eight @entity154 cities in taking part in the stunt			1
last year 's event saw tens of thousands of people daring to bare their underwear in 59 cities in 27 countries around the world			0
in @entity10 alone more than 150 took part			1
this year @entity163 startled fellow passengers on the @entity86			0
unlike freezing @entity10 participants , those who took part in @entity64 enjoyed a mild winter day , while those who took off their trousers in @entity89 basked in balmy summer weather			2
events also took place in cities such as @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity101 and @entity174			1
hilarious : a group of men share a laugh as they take part in @entity180 in @entity172 , @entity181 under - dressed on the underground : fellow passengers smile as two commuters board the train holding their trousers in the @entity181 capital @entity172 so good : passengers without pants queue to board a train and provide amusement to fellow travellers on the train in @entity172 trouser-less : two girls take off their jeans in @entity173 , @entity195 undressed to impress : one commuter with a particularly loud pair of pants stands on the platform of a station in @entity173			1

commuters in cities around the globe took part in no pants on the @entity67
passengers were undressed to impress in @entity10 , @entity101 , and @entity173
