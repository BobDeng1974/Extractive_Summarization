@entity5 during her incredible weight loss , at 22st ( left ) and 14st ( right ) hypnotherapist @entity65 worked with @entity5 to retrain her thought patterns around food , using a cpr ( control , program , rewire ) method , which involves tapping on control points on the body while repeating mantras to retrain the mind			1
