all of the economic proposals are expected to echo themes from @entity2 's re-election campaign , which focused on using increased spending to generate jobs , protecting programs to help the middle class , and bringing down the deficit in part by culling more tax revenue from the wealthiest @entity68			1
@entity2 has called for raising more revenue through closing tax breaks and loopholes , but he has not detailed a list of targets			1
he and his aides often mention as examples of unnecessary tax breaks a benefit for owners of private jets and tax subsidies for oil and gas companies			0
but no portion of @entity2 's remarks may be more poignant than the renewed call for tougher firearms laws with @entity88 and @entity89 looking on			1
their 15 - year - old daughter @entity90 was shot dead just a mile from mr @entity2 ’s @entity11 home and only a week after she performed at his second inauguration			1

her death made her the 42nd person to be gunned down in the city this year alone			0
in a bitter irony , she was not only an honors student but an advocate for her fellow pupils who said in a video posted online : ' it is your job as students to say no to gangs and yes to a great future			0

' he 's gotten all the revenue he 's going to get			0
been there , done that			0
' the backdrop for @entity2 's address will be a march 1 deadline for averting automatic across - the - board spending cuts , known as the sequester			1
the president wants lawmakers to push that deadline back for a second time to create space for a larger deficit - reduction deal , one he hopes would include a balance of targeted cuts and increased tax revenue			2
