professor @entity0 , 63 , has been struck off after a hearing heard that he punched a patient in the face ten times to fix a broken cheekbone a groundbreaking facial surgeon has been struck off after repeatedly punching a patient in the face ' like a boxer ' to fix his broken cheekbone			1
professor @entity0 , 63 , claimed he was attempting to reduce the fracture when he hit the patient up to ten times while a colleague held his head , a medical hearing heard			1
the patient , known as @entity17 , had come to @entity18 in february 2012 after an industrial accident and been operated on by @entity20 , who is a world - renowned facial surgeon			1
but he required a second procedure after falling off the bed in hospital which displaced his cheekbone			1
that 's when prof @entity0 struck the patient while he was under anesthetic			1
prof @entity0 , an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo - facial surgery at @entity18 , claimed he ' digitally manipulated ' the patient 's face and denied any wrongdoing			1
but he was ' erased ' from the medical register after the @entity37 ( @entity36 ) panel found that his fitness to practice was impaired			0
the hearing heard that @entity17 could have been blinded by the force of the punches from professor @entity0			1
chair dr @entity44 said ' under no circumstances ' would it be appropriate to apply enough force to potentially damage to the optic nerve			2
@entity49 , a dental surgeon with more than 30 years experience , said she was told to hold the patient 's head before the first punch			1
she said she was left in ' total shock ' and there were gasps from colleagues in the operating theatre as she gave a harrowing account of the procedure			0
' he made his hand into a fist and he hit the patient in the face on the left side of his cheek			2
' his hand was about six inches away			0
i think the first time he punched the patient i was n't holding him and it was then that i was instructed to do so by @entity20			2
' he said that when the patient fell out of bed , the cheekbone which was already fractured was moved outwards so he was trying to re-position it without having to make further cuts to the face			1
' he said this at least after the first punch			0
' he applied about ten punches like a boxer			1
he took aim and then punched			0
' the first punch was unexpected and then he explained what he was doing			0
he spoke as he punched again and again			0
' after graduating in medicine from the @entity85 in 1979 , mr @entity0 completed further training with the @entity87 and became a fellow of the @entity89 in 2009			2
he has lectured on titanium implants and been published in medical journals so @entity92 said she came into the hospital on her day off to take part in surgery and learn about his renowned techniques			2
@entity97 , representing the @entity98 , previously told the hearing that the case was n't based on the outcome of the procedure but the method			2
professor @entity0 did n't seek advice from colleagues and quit his post days later			1
he was also alleged to have failed to check the medical records of a second patient , @entity110 , which led to him attempting an unnecessary procedure on her , and to have treated another , @entity114 , for a complex facial deformity without seeking the advice of another surgeon			2
at the tribunal in @entity119 , miss @entity49 was asked to clarify the analogy by panel member dr @entity121 who suggested it implied prof @entity123 took a ' larger swing '			0
asked if the punch was more ' of a jab ' , she added : ' i meant he was looking to take aim			0
professor @entity0 had been an honorary locum consultant at @entity18 when he punched a patient to correct a broken cheekbone			1
he later wrote the patient 's face had been ' digitally manipulated ' ' when i said it was like a boxer i meant he was carefully aiming where he wanted to hit			1
' then he pulled his hand back to get the maximum hit as he touched the patient 's face			1
' i can remember a feeling of total shock the first time he hit the patient because i was n't expecting it and i think anyone who saw what happened was reacting in a similar way and then he asked me to assist by holding the patient 's head			1
' [ the punches ] were his fist aimed at the side of the patient 's face			1
' he was looking himself and inspecting it and asked if anybody thought the fracture had moved			0
' i understand generally it is nice not to have to make an incision but i do not understand the uncontrolled nature of hitting someone			0
' i did n't challenge him at the time			0
' miss @entity49 added that following the operation , prof @entity0 told her to write that the cheek had been adjusted by ' external pressure ' in her operating notes			1
she said : ' prof @entity0 asked me to write up the note and i felt very challenged by what he had just done			2
i asked him if he would write it and he said he would dictate the exact words for me to write down			0
' he said " the left malar was adjusted by external pressure "			0
they were precisely his words			0
' i particularly [ did n't want to ] write the note because accurately i would have had to write " prof @entity0 punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma " and that 's not something i would have wanted to do			1
' i did n't challenge him			0
partly because he is a consultant and partly because i was so shocked that i did n't have the strength to argue			0
' i did n't see any damage , i just thought it was a very unusual technique			0
' i was holding his head very still			2
it must have moved a little [ when he punched ] but not much			0
' prof @entity0 is much stronger than i am so i could only give as much support as i could so it might have moved a little			2
' if i asked you to hold something still then i punched it , you do n't know how hard someone is going to punch so you do n't know how much resistance to apply			0
' prof @entity0 has pioneered ' engineering - assisted ' surgery techniques and written extensively on the subject , as well as cosmetic surgery			1
he is now believed to be working as a consultant surgeon in @entity191 and elected not to attend the hearing but issued an email in which he ' emphatically denied ' the allegations			1
he claimed he was being ' victimised ' but the panel ignored these claims and the professor was struck off			0
panel chair @entity44 said : ' @entity198 has determined that mr @entity0 's misconduct is fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to practise medicine			1
' therefore , it has determined that , in the particular circumstances of this case , it would not be sufficient nor proportionate to suspend his registration			0
' @entity198 is of the view that the public interest requires that it be made clear that mr @entity0 's behaviour is unacceptable in a member of the medical profession			1
' @entity198 has determined to direct that mr @entity0 's name be erased from the @entity211			2
' in the light of all the evidence presented to it , it is satisfied that erasure is a proportionate sanction in his case			0
