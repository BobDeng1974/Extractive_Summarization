no need to call the cops , the three men caught on camera smoking marijuana in an entertaining new video are actually former police offers themselves - and , of course , the substance that they 're lighting up is completely legal			1
recorded in the state of @entity11 , where recreational use of marijuana was legalized in july of last year , the video , created by @entity9 , sees each of the three ex-cops taking hits from a bong , before offering their thoughts , both funny and thoughtful , on the controversial substance			1
' it 's like the last piece of prohibition , ' says @entity23 , 73 , who worked as a police officer from 1970 to 1986 before performing criminal justice training for another decade			2
' i think it should be legal [ and ] i think it should be more widely available for medical reasons			0
' i tried it once and i tell you , i was on a waterbed with a very agreeable woman and listening to @entity58 , which i know lasts for about 18 minutes and 40 seconds , and it lasted for , oh hell , two or three hours , ' says @entity23			0
@entity37 , who served as a reserve police officer from 1997 to 2004 , says he smoked for the first time at the age 14 , but stopped for a while afterward because he got caught			2
' the last time i smoked was probably in 1968 when i was in college , ' says @entity35 , 67 , who was on the force from 1970 to 1997			0
celebrating 420 : the video was released on april 20 , which is regarded by many smokers as the national day to get high they 've got the munchies : the three ex-cops snacked on chips and cookies while they smoked and talked for several hours in between bong hits and self - administered field sobriety tests , the trio debates the dangers and benefits of using marijuana			1
@entity35 says that one argument for legalizing the drug is knowing what you 're getting when you buy it ; he explains that when people get it on the street , they do n't always know what their marijuana has been cut with			1
sometimes it can be mixed with more dangerous substances			0
while they disagree on whether it 's a gateway drug - @entity23 notes that every heroin addict started out drinking milk , implying that it 's difficult to link the use of one product to another - they all seem to agree that legal repercussions for using marijuana do more harm than good			1
' it costs more to put someone in prison than it does to send someone to @entity111 , ' says @entity23 , suggesting that sending people to prison for marijuana possession or distribution is a wasteful drain on society			2
' as far as i can remember , i never arrested anyone for it , but i took a lot of pot away from people and threw it away in front of them , ' says @entity35 , adding that he thought that his personal punishment was a bigger deterrent than writing them a citation			0
pot partakers : @entity35 , left , says he never wrote a criminal citation to someone with marijuana , but would throw out their drugs in front of them ; while he served , it was illegal in every state special cause : the video links to @entity142 's @entity141 , which is raising money for the @entity146 mother 's legal defense ; her 11 - year - old son was taken away from her for discussing medical marijuana at one point , the interviewer tells the former officers that some people report feeling sexually aroused when they smoke			1
' i 'm 73 years old , i do n't know what the hell you 're talking about ! ' answers @entity23			0
' it 's been so long since i 've made love , i ca n't remember who ties up whom ! ' while the ex-cops ' cracks are certainly meant to elicit laughs , the video also aims to promote the @entity166 page of activist @entity142			0
the @entity146 mother 's 11 - year - old son was taken away from her late last month when , during a drug discussion at his school , he extolled the benefits of medical marijuana			1
@entity142 , who used cannabis oil to treat her @entity175 â€™s disease , is now raising money for her legal fees .			0
