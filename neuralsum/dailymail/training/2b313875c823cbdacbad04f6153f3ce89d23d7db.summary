the government is launching its biggest investment in roads since the 1970s , putting aside £ 168million to repair the potholes that blight the country ’s roads and frustrate motorists			1
more than three million potholes will be filled in by march next year and the money will be spread 148 councils			1
each will get a share but those councils who demonstrate ‘ best practice in highways maintenance ’ will get additional funding			1
prime minister @entity25 joins pothole campaigner @entity26 ( centre ) and @entity28 mp during a visit to @entity30 , @entity31 to inspect the potholes that blight the city it could be almost any street in @entity35 that @entity25 , the prime minister , is walking down			1

@entity63 , where new pothole - fixing equipment can be converted to salt icy roads in winter , gets around £ 6million , while @entity66 will receive £ 4.9million			1
some £ 10million is also earmarked for @entity51 , the @entity67 said			1
as well as damaging cars , potholes can cause fatal accidents			1
@entity71 , a 51 - year - old service engineer , on a charity ride from @entity73 to @entity74 , died instantly from severe head injuries when he was thrown into the path of the car behind him after his bike hit a four - inch deep pothole on the @entity81 at @entity82 , @entity53			2
@entity83 , a retired nurse who served in @entity84 during the @entity85 , was walking around numerous potholes and ' unclear ' road markings in @entity89 car park , @entity90 , @entity91 when she was hit and killed by a reversing van			1
the owners of the car park , @entity94 , were found guilty of breaching health and safety guidelines and were fined £ 95,000 , with £ 50,000 costs			2
forty - five per cent of drivers say that they have had an accident or near miss because of a pothole			2
the money must be used to repair potholes or ensure that they do not appear in the first place			1
councils will also have to publish updates on works every three months so residents can see how repairs are progressing , and all work has to be completed by march 2015			1
@entity112 , the @entity113 , said : ‘ potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace			1
‘ but it is only one part of a massive programme of investment to get our country up to speed as part of this government ’s long - term economic plan			2
by building , repairing and renewing our key infrastructure we will ensure the future growth and prosperity of this country			2
’ the £ 168million pothole funding was announced by chancellor @entity137 in @entity138 , and is in addition to the extra £ 185million the government made available that month to help repair local roads damaged by severe weather			1
some £ 24billion will be spent on @entity2 ’s motorways and a-roads between 2010 and 2021 , the biggest investment in the road network since the 1970s			1
the government said a further £ 7.4billion would committed to local roads in the next @entity149 , along with funding from the £ 12billion local @entity151			1
1 if it ’s safe , gather evidence of the pothole as soon as you can , including photographs , measurements and position on the road ( for example , is it on a blind corner ? )			2
2 report the pothole to the relevant council or to the @entity163			0
councils are responsible for a and b roads , and inner - city roads			1
motorways are the responsibility of the @entity163			0
3 obtain a full breakdown of costs for all damage caused by the pothole			0
if you incur additional costs , keep a record of these but remember that you might not get any or all of your expenditure back and that any unrealistic or extravagant claims are likely to be turned down			0
4 submit a @entity179 request to the relevant council or to the @entity163 to establish how often the road is inspected or maintained			2
to find out how to do this , type the name of the authority you are claiming against , along with the words ‘ freedom of information ’ , into an internet search engine , and you will find the relevant web page			0
5 download the national code of good practice for highway maintenance and familiarise yourself with the guidance on highways management			2
6 write a detailed letter to the local authority explaining exactly what happened			0
include a map of the area , marking the location of the pothole			0
highlight your costs and explain that you wish to claim for compensation			0
your letter might eventually be read out in court , so keep it factual and concise			0
7 your claim may be initially rejected under @entity207 of the @entity208			0
this allows a council or the @entity163 to defend claims on the basis that they had taken reasonable measures to ensure potholes were found and dealt with swiftly			1
provided they have followed their system of regular repairs and inspections , they may be successful in rejecting your claim			2
8 use your @entity222 request information and the checklist at @entity224 to evaluate the local authority ’s defence against your claim			0
if you think you still have a case , write back to the authority pointing out the discrepancies and include evidence in the form of paperwork and photographs			0
inform them that you do n’t consider they have satisfied @entity207			0
remember , finding discrepancies does n’t automatically lead to a successful claim			0
there could be a reasonable explanation or you may have misinterpreted the @entity242 might also be prepared to defend the discrepancy in court			0
9 if the local authority still refuses your claim , think carefully how you want to proceed			0
you might even want to take some legal advice at this stage as you may end up spending more money in court fees than you receive in compensation			2
small claims are effective for taking action for small amounts and can now be completed online at @entity254			0
10 if an offer is made , be willing to negotiate			0
you might not be entitled to claim for all the costs you incur			0
