this , @entity0 really should concede , is why you avoid long - haul travel on the eve of a game			1
why matters here in @entity6 need to remain the priority ahead of commitments to their super-rich owners in @entity10			0
why a catwalk encounter with @entity12 was probably not what @entity13 and his players needed after that bruising defeat by @entity17 the previous weekend			0
@entity13 would not admit it , of course			0
blaming his employers for this , @entity0 ’s second @entity21 defeat by @entity23 opposition in as many years , would amount to printing off his own @entity25			1
particularly when the airline are the club sponsors			0
but @entity0 performed like a team that had sat on a plane for seven hours , arriving late on friday night after five days in a different time zone			1
and @entity30 were only too happy to take advantage			1
@entity30 striker @entity32 celebrates after scoring for his side against @entity0 @entity32 was put through on goal after @entity0 goalkeeper @entity35 collided with @entity36 the @entity30 forward raced through before beating @entity0 midfielder @entity37 to the ball to convert @entity39 ( second right ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring at @entity43 in the @entity21 fourth round @entity0 players @entity48 ( left ) , @entity45 ( centre ) and @entity37 look dejected after their side concede @entity30 substitute @entity50 celebrates after scoring in stoppage time to seal his side 's passage to the next round the two @entity30 goalscorers @entity32 ( left ) and @entity50 embrace at full time after their stunning victory @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity57 4 ; @entity58 6 , @entity45 5 , @entity59 5 , @entity60 6 ; @entity61 5 ( @entity62 67 ' 6 ) , @entity48 6 , @entity37 4 ( @entity63 79 ' ) , @entity64 5 ; @entity65 6 , @entity66 5 ( @entity67 ' 6 )			1

this was their third match in a week after all			0
but players pushing hard for promotion seemed eager to demonstrate that they will be ready should they find themselves back in the @entity104 next season			0
with second - half goals from @entity32 and @entity50 , a place in the fifth round of this competition was no less than they deserved			1
@entity0 might well point to the period of dominance they enjoyed in the opening 45 minutes and a series of outstanding saves from @entity74 did deny them a goal			2
but it was a very different @entity117 side that stumbled through the second half , with fatigue as serious an issue as a lack of composure , after @entity32 superseded his previous appearance at the @entity43 — as a paying spectator at a @entity126 concert			1
in the case of that opening goal , there might also have been a hint of cowardice , with the error - prone @entity35 seemingly reluctant to commit to a 50:50 challenge with @entity36			2
for a watching @entity13 , it certainly amounted to the stuff of nightmares			0
first came the undercooked backpass from @entity37 , then the sight of @entity57 allowing @entity81 to knock the ball beyond him , before the two of them ended up in a heap and then , finally , the sight of a sluggish @entity37 trying to make a clearance that @entity32 was bright enough to anticipate , intercept and direct the ball over the line			2
as @entity13 admitted , ‘ disorder ’ spread through @entity0 ’s ranks and @entity30 were only too happy to exploit their weaknesses			1
defensively @entity30 were outstanding here but there were some fine attacking displays too			2
@entity32 , on loan from @entity154 , was among the best but @entity84 was terrific , almost scoring too when he followed a marvellous turn with a shot that bounced off a post and across the face of goal			1
@entity30 's @entity80 ( left ) and @entity0 's @entity48 battle for the ball during the first half @entity30 's @entity77 challenges @entity0 striker @entity66 ( left ) at the @entity43 @entity30 manager @entity96 ( right ) watches on during the first half of the match at the @entity43 @entity58 of @entity0 battles for the ball with @entity32 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) of @entity30 manager @entity13 and his players arrived back in @entity168 at about 8pm on friday night @entity64 and @entity73 headed straight to the club 's training base to prepare for saturday 's game for @entity0 ’s stunned supporters , the only consolation was the fact that they were charged so little to witness this			1
just £ 15 for adults and a fiver for kids			0
but if @entity13 insisted his side were taking this competition as seriously as the others after being eliminated here by @entity184 last term — he said as much in his programme notes — the evidence suggested otherwise			0
the warning signs were there in the opening minute when @entity73 made a mistake that @entity30 went close to capitalising on			1
but in fairness to @entity0 , they did then show enough composure to play some decent football that , had it not been for @entity195 , would have been rewarded with a goal			2
the shots on target were frequent but so too were some excellent saves from the @entity200			0
he might have played for @entity202 only once in seven years , but he excelled in the way he denied @entity48 , @entity64 and @entity66			0
other opportunities were squandered by @entity0			2
@entity65 invited @entity64 to score but the shot was way off target , while @entity45 took two swipes at a @entity48 cross only to send his second effort yards over the crossbar			0
in total , @entity0 had 13 shots in the first half ; a measure , if you like , of their frustration			2
@entity0 striker @entity65 runs with the ball between a trio of @entity30 players @entity30 's @entity223 midfielder @entity36 ( right ) clears the ball with an acrobatic header as @entity226 watches on @entity0 's @entity66 ( left ) rues a missed chance as @entity30 's @entity229 goalkeeper @entity74 collects the ball @entity0 's @entity64 ( right ) is challenged by @entity30 's @entity79 during the fourth round clash @entity32 ’s goal made that miss all the more frustrating for @entity0 , but all the more concerning for their manager was the fact that soon afterwards they almost gave away a second			1
@entity238 was at fault , passing straight to @entity84 who then skipped past one challenge before unleashing a shot that the @entity243 goalkeeper – to his credit – saved before three @entity0 bodies threw themselves in the path of the follow - up effort from @entity80			2
@entity13 responded by sending on @entity62 from the bench , and the former @entity154 midfielder almost equalised when a deflected effort bounced off a post			2
but @entity30 had other chances before @entity50 ’s breakaway strike , with @entity84 seeing a shot bounce off a post and @entity81 almost lob @entity57			1
@entity30 forward @entity32 slides in to put the away side ahead as @entity0 midfielder @entity37 attempts to stop him @entity258 celebrates after putting his side ahead in the second half against @entity0 @entity0 goalkeeper @entity57 wipes his brow in dejection after his side conceded the opener @entity30 's @entity84 lashes out after narrowly failing to score after a rebound off the post during the @entity268 fourth round @entity0 boss @entity13 looking frustrated as his side struggled in the second half at the @entity43 @entity50 scored the second which secured @entity30 's passage to the fifth round @entity271 for more from @entity274 's @entity273 for @entity96 , a one - time @entity202 player meeting a former @entity202 manager for the first time , it must have been particularly pleasurable			1
for @entity13 , however , there was plenty to regret			0
long - haul travel being one of them			0
with the start of the second half came yet another marvellous stop by @entity74 , this time to parry a goal - bound header from @entity66			0
@entity32 ’s goal made that miss all the more costly for @entity0 , but all the more concerning for their manager was the fact that , soon afterwards , they almost gave away a second			1
@entity238 was at fault , passing straight to @entity84 who then skipped past one challenge before unleashing a shot that the @entity243 goalkeeper saved , before three @entity0 bodies threw themselves in the path of @entity80 ’s follow - up			0
@entity13 responded by bringing on @entity62 and the former @entity154 midfielder almost equalised when a deflected effort bounced off a post			0

@entity30 substitute @entity50 celebrates by kissing the turf at the @entity43 after making it 2 - 0 @entity30 players celebrate with their travelling supporters after full time at the @entity43			1

@entity32 scored as @entity30 stunned @entity0 at the @entity43
the @entity154 loanee capitalised on poor goalkeeping from @entity35 to score
@entity50 then made it two in stoppage time to secure @entity30 's passage to the fifth round
