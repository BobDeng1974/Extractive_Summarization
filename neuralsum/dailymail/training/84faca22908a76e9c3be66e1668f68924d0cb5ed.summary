@entity102 , normally one of the most reliable resorts in @entity105 for snow , also cancelled the men ’s @entity66 giant slalom and slalom races last weekend			2

ski instructor @entity147 said : ‘ at the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy , but from next weekend the resorts will be full for @entity99 and @entity153			2
‘ if all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall , perhaps only a few snowflakes , is predicted between now and @entity99			0
