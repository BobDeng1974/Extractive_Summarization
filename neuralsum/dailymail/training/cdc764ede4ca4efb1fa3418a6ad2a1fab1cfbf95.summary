by @entity0 published : 00:21 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 00:21 est , 21 november 2012 pardoning a lucky turkey ahead of the @entity3 holiday has been a tradition for nearly half a century , started by president @entity5 , and carried on by each president since			1
but now @entity7 ( @entity7 ) has sent a letter to the president imploring him to put a stop to the ‘ sorely outdated ’ ceremony that ‘ makes light of the mass slaughter of some 46million gentle , intelligent birds			1
’ the animal rights organization asked the president to forego the tradition and instead put a @entity19 roast on the holiday table			2
pardoning : @entity22 pardons courage the @entity23 in 2009 tasty treat ? in 2010 , mr @entity22 pardoned @entity25 while his daughters @entity27 and @entity28 look on ; he joked in 2009 that they were the reason he did n't eat the pardoned bird @entity31 and justice for all : last year , a 45 - pound bird named @entity31 was the lucky turkey to get a presidential pardon @entity7 president @entity37 wrote to mr @entity22 , saying that the annual turkey pardon ‘ makes light of the mass slaughter ’ of each turkey and ‘ portrays the @entity42 ’ president as being in some sort of business partnership with the turkey - killing industry			1
’ she wrote that @entity19 – turkey made from tofu – is a ‘ delicious , healthy ’ alternative to eating a turkey			0
by tuesday night , ms @entity37 said that she received no official answer from the @entity53 either way , though it seems highly unlikely that mr @entity22 would cancel the wednesday afternoon ceremony			2
earlier tuesday , the official @entity53 facebook page posted a picture encouraging users to vote for which turkey should be the official bird of the 2012 holiday – cobbler or @entity63			1
the @entity53 blog compiled a short biography for the two birds , saying that both were born on a farm in @entity69 , @entity70			2
fight for the right : an activist of animal rights group @entity7 holds a sign and a box of @entity75 , a vegetable protein turkey replacement in front of the @entity53 in 2010 undressing for a cause : two scantily - clad women representing @entity7 hand out egg - free cupcakes and pamphlets with egg - free recipes in front of the ‘ cobbler and @entity63 may look alike , but they ’re no birds of a feather			1
cobbler craves cranberries , is known for his strut , and enjoys the musical styling of @entity89			0
‘ @entity63 , a patient but proud bird , loves to nibble on corn and enjoys any music with a fiddle			2
’ following the pardoning , both turkeys will be transported to @entity96 , the estate of @entity97 , where they will be placed in a custom - made pen at the livestock facility			0
mr @entity22 joked with reporters in 2009 that his daughters @entity28 and @entity27 were the true saviors of the turkey that year			0
‘ i was ready to eat this sucker , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m told presidents @entity105 and @entity106 actually ate their turkeys , ’ mr @entity22 continued			0
‘ you ca n’t fault them for that ; that ’s a good - looking bird			0
’ contender : cobbler is one of the turkeys up to be this year 's official turkey , and enjoys strutting and eating cranberries competition : @entity63 is also in the running and enjoys fiddle music and corn			1

@entity7 president urges the president to forego ' outdated ' ceremony , saying it 's cruel to the 46million turkeys killed each year
@entity129 has been a tradition since @entity5 was in office
@entity53 has given @entity7 president no official response but will likely carry on ceremony today when either cobbler or @entity63 will be pardoned
