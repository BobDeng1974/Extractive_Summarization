victim : @entity8 , dr @entity7 , who has @entity10 heritage and a phd , was labelled the ' wrong colour ' to be a director of nursing in @entity14 ‘ but i would never be a director of nursing in @entity14 because i was the wrong colour and wrong culture for the organisation			1
‘ he said i needed to go back to where i came from to get a director of nursing position			2

dr @entity7 added : ‘ i was just stunned , i have been a nurse since 1986 and i ’ve faced many things in nursing			2
