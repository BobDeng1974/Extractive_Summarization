by @entity0 the bodies of nearly 500 babies were handed over to @entity5 universities for research over a 25 - year period , it emerged today			1
new figures show the unclaimed remains of 474 infants who died in mother - and - baby homes and hospitals were used for anatomical study in medical departments			1
they were given to four @entity5 universities between 1940 and 1965 apparently without consent			2
the revelation comes amid controversy surrounding mother - and - baby homes in @entity5 after the discovery that as many 800 infants may be buried in a mass grave outside a former home			2
@entity25 ( pictured in 1946 ) was among four universities which used the unclaimed remains of nearly 500 infants who died in mother - and - baby home and hospitals for research between 1940 and 1965 the colleges - the @entity32 , @entity25 , the @entity33 in @entity34 and @entity35 - were allowed to receive bodies donated by the individual or volunteered by a next - of - kin or loco parentis under the @entity39			1
however , the practice stopped in the mid- 1960s after a public campaign by anatomy professors to encourage public donations			1
all donations must now been made with informed consent			0
in a statement to the @entity49 , the anatomical committee of @entity5 medical schools said : ' practices have long been in place to ensure absolute procedural sensitivity towards donors and families			2
' the four universities have also now set up helplines for the first time for families who want details about the remains of relatives			0
the @entity32 used the unclaimed bodies of 249 babies for research before the practices was stopped in the mid- 1960s following a public campaign to encourage public donation , new figures show @entity32 - 249 @entity25 - 103 @entity33 - 87 @entity35 - 35 total - 474 the practice is expected to form part of the government 's @entity70 , of which an inital review report is due out early next week			1
the @entity73 is also drawing up the @entity74 which set out new arrangements for the donations of bodies to anatomy schools			0
earlier this month , @entity5 premier , @entity79 , ordered ministers to see whether there are more mass baby graves after a researcher found records showing that 796 children , mostly infants , died in a home in @entity87 , @entity88 , which operated from 1925 until 1962			0
residents suspect they were interred in a nearby field , including in a disused septic tank			0
@entity5 had some 10 such mother - and - baby homes run by different orders until the 1960s .			0
