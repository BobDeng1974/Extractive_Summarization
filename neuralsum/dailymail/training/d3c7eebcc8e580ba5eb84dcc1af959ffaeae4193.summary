salvage experts believe that an inadequately - secured @entity1 could have dug a hole in the side of a ship which was deliberately grounded on a sandbank in the @entity6			1
the engineers say the @entity8 may have been thrown off balance because one of the 105 excavators broke free from its restraints as the ship began its voyage			1
it comes as experts abandoned today 's plans to re-float the vessel , after warnings it had taken on more water than previously thought			1
this picture shows some of the @entity1 vehicles on @entity8 's cargo deck before it set sail engineers say the vessel may have been thrown off balance because one of the 105 excavators broke free from its restraints as the ship began its voyage speaking about the dramatic incident , @entity33 , from salvage company @entity34 , said an excavator shifted on the sixth deck , knocking a hole in the hull of the vehicle carrier			1
despite being quickly repaired by engineers , it is thought the hole could have caused the ship to list			1
mr @entity33 added that members of his 18 - strong team had been on board the vessel and inspected the cargo , most of which had remained in place			2
a single @entity53 , estimated to be worth about £ 260,000 , was on board , among more than 1,000 @entity55 and @entity56 and 65 @entity57			0
the £ 35million cargo - all destined for @entity60 customers - could be scrapped , even if the vehicles are retrieved with little damage			0
he said : ' we have not looked in detail at the cargo , we have only looked if we have some displacement of the cargo and we have seen a few vehicles , big ones , that have			0
' salvage experts had said they planned to attempt to refloat the giant vessel at high tide today			1
but the @entity74 have now confirmed that plans have been delayed			2
the @entity77 - registered ship is currently listing at 52 degrees and the salvage operation is expected to take days , possibly weeks			2
a spokesman said : ' following the completion of the salvors ' calculations this evening , it has been decided that there will not be an attempt to re-float the @entity87 tomorrow			0
' the salvors ' calculations revealed that more water has entered the vessel than previously thought			2
' the preparation for the re-float will therefore take longer than the weather window will allow tomorrow			0
the @entity8 was deliberately run aground on a sandbank called the @entity95 between @entity96 and the @entity97 on saturday night to prevent it capsizing ' the alternative option of securing the @entity87 will be followed and preparations for the re-float will continue when the weather allows			1
' the 51,000 tonne ship was deliberately run aground on saturday night on a sandbank called the @entity95 , between @entity96 and the @entity97 , to prevent it capsizing			1
the vessel , which has a cargo of 1,400 cars and 80 pieces of construction equipment , began to list as it left the port , forcing the captain and the pilot to take the emergency action			1
a bid to pull the ship free at high tide using four tugs failed on monday , leaving the 180 metre long @entity8 grounded because the tides were not high enough to refloat her			1
a 200m exclusion zone has been set up around the ship to prevent small vessels interfering with the tugs and other shipping			1
the vessel , which has a cargo of 1,400 cars and 80 pieces of construction equipment , began to list as it left the port , forcing the captain and the pilot to take the emergency action a massive rescue operation was launched on saturday night involving four lifeboats and four tugs working to save the entire crew of 25 , which was eventually winched off the vessel and taken to safety			1
according to an @entity141 spokesman , some of them had to be rescued from the water			0
a helicopter and lifeboats from @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 were scrambled to the scene			0
a total of 22 crew were initially rescued from the doomed ship , leaving three senior officers aboard			2
however , the last three had to be winched to safety at 2am , when then the ship listed forther			2
@entity156 , spokesman for @entity157 which owns the vessel , said that the cause of the incident would be the subject of a marine accident investigation			2
he said the company was currently assessing damage and stability issues on board its vessel and that the primary concern had been for the crew on board			0
it has been confirmed that one crew member was injured			0
he was airlifted to @entity174 @entity173 in @entity175 with non-life threatening injuries			0
one of the major problems facing salvage workers is the immense weight of the ship and its cargo			0
sources say that one way to assist in refloating the boat would be to remove the cars from its cargo hold			0
but such an operation is expected to present an immense logistical headache			0
@entity95 is a well - known sandbank in @entity191 and is the scene of an annual cricket match between two yachting clubs when the sands are exposed in low spring tides			0
in november 2008 , the @entity198 liner queen elizabeth 2 with 1,700 passengers on board ran aground on @entity95 but was able to continue its journey on the rising tide after four tugs pulled it clear .			1
