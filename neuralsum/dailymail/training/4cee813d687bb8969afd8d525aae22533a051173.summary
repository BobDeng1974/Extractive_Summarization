the former @entity7 journalist – who worked closely with the @entity9 london mayor and helped mastermind his re-election – starts work today as communications director at @entity14 ’s media company			1
mr @entity3 ’s appointment will raise questions about continuing close links between the company and the @entity9 , which are under intense scrutiny at the @entity20 into press standards			1
earlier this month it emerged that @entity23 nearly hired mr @entity3 to be his spin doctor ahead of his eventual appointment of former @entity27 editor @entity26			2
mr @entity26 told the inquiry that mr @entity23 had held talks with mr @entity3 but was persuaded by @entity30 to hire him instead			0
mr @entity3 , the @entity7 ’s former chief political correspondent , went on to become mr @entity2 ’s spin doctor when he first won office in 2008 and worked with the mayor until his re-election for a second term earlier this month			1
it is understood that the prime minister made a second attempt to woo mr @entity3 after he let it be known that he would be stepping down as mr @entity2 ’s director of external affairs			1
commenting on mr @entity3 ’s new job , @entity42 mp @entity41 said : ‘ it feels a bit like the revolving door of the @entity9 , the @entity47 and @entity5 continues to revolve			1
’ @entity42 ’s media spokesman , @entity48 , said : ‘ it seems that the lure of @entity14 or his money is irresistible to some people in the political world – but this is a mistake , especially after @entity2 called for the head of the @entity7 to be a @entity9			1
‘ of course newspapers have values but to be able to hold politicians to account they need a degree of independence from political parties , which mr @entity3 is signally failing to demonstrate			0
’ mr @entity3 , 45 , who is reported to be on a salary of £ 250,000 a year , will be responsible for restoring @entity5 ’s battered image in the wake of the phone hacking scandal			2
but , after four years at mr @entity2 ’s side , he will have an intimate knowledge of the thinking of a politician still tipped to succeed mr @entity23 as @entity9 leader			2
mr @entity3 replaces @entity70 who held the position in an interim capacity and has recently set up his own agency			0
links : @entity42 mp @entity41 , left , has questioned if the appointment of @entity3 , centre , showed continuing close ties between the company run by @entity14 , right , and the @entity9 mr @entity2 , meanwhile , has been criticised for initially dismissing the hacking scandal as party political ‘ codswallop ’ in september 2010			1
documents subsequently revealed that @entity5 was at the time offering him £ 2million towards an academy school in @entity84 and talking of donating millions more to sponsor another @entity2 project , a cable car crossing the @entity87			1
pressure : culture secretary @entity89 , right , seen walking with former adviser @entity90 , left , will appear before the @entity20 this week in 2010 , according to emails already published by @entity93 , @entity5 executive @entity91 asked colleagues : ‘ where are we with the schools project , particularly @entity2 securing the land and [ education secretary ] @entity99 the capital investment ? ’ both offers were , however , dropped shortly afterwards			1
beleaguered culture secretary @entity89 faces more pressure this week when the men at the centre of the row over his handling of the @entity14 bid for @entity109 give evidence to the @entity20			2
his former special adviser , @entity90 , and @entity113 ’s chief lobbyist , @entity114 , will appear on thursday , leading to fresh scrutiny of the minister ’s role in the £ 8billion bid by the company to take full control of the broadcaster			0
mr @entity90 quit last month after a damning 163 - page dossier of emails between the minister ’s office and the @entity14 empire was published during @entity127 ’s testimony to the inquiry			0
mr @entity90 admitted he went ‘ too far ’ in handing sensitive information to mr @entity114 , but said he acted ‘ without authorisation ’ from the minister			0
mr @entity89 insists he acted with propriety and did not know what mr @entity90 was doing			0
@entity5 chief executive @entity134 said : ‘ @entity3 ’s experience as a communications professional , along with his solid journalistic background , means he is well qualified to lead us through the challenges we face as @entity5 continues to change and progress			2
’ mr @entity3 said : ‘ with a proud heritage and firm commitment to serious journalism , i relish the chance to play my part in helping the new leadership secure a strong future			0
’ last week , the company ’s former chief executive , @entity148 , 43 , was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice along with her husband @entity153 and four others			0
