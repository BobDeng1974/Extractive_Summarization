home helps must stay for at least half an hour with frail pensioners under new rules to end the scandal of ‘ drive - by ’ visits			0
updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing			1
the advice , published by @entity15 spending watchdog @entity13 , said 15 - minute drop - ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication			1
better care : health watchdog @entity13 has published new guidelines in bid to stop ' drive - by ' visits of carers ( stock photo ) in a sign of how bad things have become , guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly – telling home helps to leave enough time to ‘ talk to the person ’			1
care workers are also reminded to treat people with ‘ empathy , courtesy , respect and in a dignified way ’			0
the move marks a victory for the @entity43 , which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our dignity for the @entity49 campaign			1
last month a @entity43 investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes – with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes			1
some staff were even told not to chat because it wastes time , while visitors are sometimes poorly trained contractors or ill - suited to the job			0
in crisis : the recommendations come as @entity62 say funding for social care is ' in crisis ' ( stock image ) the guidance called on councils to ensure home care workers ‘ have time to do their job without being rushed or compromising the dignity of the person who uses services ’			2
it also attempts to stamp out the conveyor belt culture under which pensioners can be seen by ten or 15 different carers in a fortnight , saying ‘ continuity of care ’ must be a priority			2
last night care minister @entity83 called on councils to adopt the guidance as soon as possible , saying that many authorities were ‘ complicit ’ in providing poor care			0
however , the @entity62 , which represents councils , said money was just too short to end 15 - minute care visits once and for all			1
chairman @entity92 said funding for adult social care is ‘ in crisis ’			0
@entity96 are being urged to visit the elderly at least once a year to check they are not too cold , @entity13 guidance says			2
meter readers could also check the temperature in pensioners ’ homes and alert surgeries , it advises .			0

@entity15 watchdog @entity13 published new guidelines for caring
personal care appointments for washing or dressing must be 30 minutes
15 - minute drop - ins only appropriate for checking medication taken
