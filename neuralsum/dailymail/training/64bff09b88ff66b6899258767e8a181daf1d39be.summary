@entity0 , a spinal surgery specialist , abused his trusted status to commit the assaults on women - some of whom were vulnerable - while working at @entity6 's @entity19 and @entity21 hospitals			1
the 51 - year - old consultant was described during his two month trial at @entity24 as ' a good surgeon but not a good man			1
' jurors heard he performed intimate and prolonged examinations on women , often without gloves , which were found to be medically unjustifiable			1
they had come to him for back and neck problems			0
@entity0 was found guilty of nine sexual assaults against six women , which took place between 2012 and 2013			1
at a hearing at @entity24 judge @entity40 told the neurosurgeon he was the most intelligent man he had ever seen in the dock of a criminal court but that he had been ' brought low ' by lust			1
he said @entity0 exercised his lust ' arrogantly ' over his patients , abusing them in what he described as ' the most extreme breach of trust			1
' among @entity0 's victims was a woman in her mid- 20s whose complaint led to the neurosurgeon 's arrest and him being charged in november last year			1
this then triggered a sequence of events that led to other victims coming forward to report assaults at the hands of @entity0			1
when he was arrested @entity0 claimed his intimate examinations were medically justified but a subsequent investigation found this was not the case			1
the patient , who can not be named for legal reasons , told jurors she felt ' frozen to the spot ' as she was subjected to an assault at the private @entity69 in @entity6 last year			1
she has since been praised for her bravery in exposing the abuse of trust by @entity0			1
the other charges relate to four women who attended hospital for a variety of complaints between january and september 2012			2
the spinal injury specialist used his trusted status to attack the women , performing medically unjustifiable examinations on them			2
jurors heard that the victims , some of whom were described as vulnerable , were referred to @entity0 for neurosurgical assessment over a two - year period			1
@entity0 encouraged some of his patients to remove their clothing and on occasions , removed their clothes himself without a chaperone being present			2
he would then perform intimate examinations without wearing gloves , and made inappropriate sexual remarks			1
@entity0 abused patients during intimate medical examinations at the @entity100 in @entity6 the first victim to come forward said she was ' frozen to the spot ' when @entity0 abused her at @entity69 expert medical opinion was sought on the examination techniques he was using and he was found to be ignoring @entity106 guidelines			1
judge @entity40 jailed @entity0 for 16 years for the nine sexual assaults			1
he said : ' this is the most extreme breach of trust			0
' these ladies went to see you because they had significant problems and they thought - with your skills , abilities and experience - you were the person who could help them with the medical problems			2
' instead you grossly abused them			0
' @entity0 claimed throughout his trial at @entity24 that his victims were either lying or mistaken when he was arrested @entity0 tried to use his medical knowledge of research to claim his examinations were justified but this was later disproved			1
judge @entity125 added : ' you are without question in my experience the most intelligent man i have ever seen in the dock of a criminal court			1
' you , through hard work and devotion to your course of studies , rose high within your profession to become an enormously respected consultant neurosurgeon at one of the great hospitals in our region			0
@entity142 say they can not rule out the chance that @entity0 may have abused more women who had been in his care but who had not yet come forward			1
detective inspector @entity147 said : ' he 's been a neurosurgeon for a period of time , and these are the victims that have come forward to us at the moment			2
' it may be that we get further victims come forward			2
' it 's important that if they do , we will help them			0
' and it might show that it 's been occurring over a longer period			0
' mr @entity147 said @entity0 relied on his medical knowledge to claim what he did was justified and that his victims were wrong but this was later found to be incorrect			2
he added : ' to be in a position of having those skills and using that ability to sexually assault patients is very sad			1
' ' you were brought low by a simple failing - lust			1
' and you exercised your lust as a result of arrogance			0
you liked doing what you did , touching sexually your female patients , and you took the opportunity to do it because you could			0
' @entity0 , of @entity177 , @entity6 , trained in @entity178 and moved to @entity179 in 2000			2
he got a job at the @entity69 where he worked between 2003 and 2013 as a consultant specialising in disorders affecting the skull , spine and nervous system			2
@entity0 was acquitted of five charges of sexual assaults which related to four other patients			2
speaking after the case crown advocate @entity190 , who acted as junior prosecution counsel , said : ' @entity0 , whilst in a position of high trust , carried out intrusive and inappropriate examinations on vulnerable women while masking his true purpose , which was personal sexual gratification			1
' these examinations left women shocked , confused , embarrassed and deeply upset			2
' many were fearful about reporting one of the most highly esteemed consultant neurosurgeons to the authorities			0
' it is due to their courage and the cogent evidence they gave that @entity0 has been found guilty today of his crimes			2
' @entity209 , senior crown prosecutor from the @entity211 's @entity210 , said : ' this case is an example of a gross breach of trust at the highest level and i would like to thank all those victims who came forward and assisted the whole of the prosecution team in exposing this man			2
' the brave woman whose courage led to @entity0 's conviction the sex attacks carried out by @entity0 as he abused his position as a trusted surgeon could have gone undetected were it not for the courage of one of his patients			1
the woman , who is in her 20s , decided to go to him because she was suffering chronic pain and health issues stemming from a back complaint following an accident			0
she chose @entity0 because of his reputation , but this ended in a sexual assault at the private @entity69 in @entity6			1
the woman told jurors she felt ' frozen to the spot ' on the examination table as the 51 - year - old carried out a lengthy assault lasting some 20 minutes			1
she said : ' he was doing this rubbing thing on my legs and just kept going higher and higher			0
' he then started asking about my sex life ... the whole thing was mortifying			0
' she was then told by @entity0 that she was a ' sweet girl ' before he led her out of her office			0
the woman burst into tears as she walked through the car park and phoned a relative to tell her ' i think i 've just been sexually assaulted '			0
she then contacted police which led to @entity0 's arrest and the conclusion that his intimate examination was not medically justified and was sexual assault			1
after this police began to search for other victims			0
@entity0 was charged and this triggered a letter from his employer , @entity269 , which was sent to more than 700 patients			0
patients were asked if they had any concerns they wished to report , but the letter did not name him			0
for the woman who triggered the police investigation into @entity0 's offending , her feelings are mixed			1
she said : ' i 'll now always insist on seeing a female doctor , and if there 's not one available i 'll wait and put up with the pain until one is free			0
that 's how he 's left me feeling			0
' i 've seen countless doctors in the past and never felt any reservations about them , but what he did has changed all that and wrecked my confidence			0
' she said she was pleased she contacted police and was proud this led to the investigation			0
she added : ' it 's reassuring to think i might have saved other women from going through the same ordeal as me			0
' of the surgeon , who throughout his trial alleged his accusers were either lying or mistaken , she said : ' i do n't hate him , i pity him			0
' he 's abused his position of trust and sacrificed his career , his livelihood and his reputation and for what ? a few moments of weird gratification			2
' the knowledge he 'll be sent to prison and punished for what he 's done will help me move on			0
' detective inspector @entity147 , of @entity142 , has praised the woman for coming forward , and for the courage of other victims who also gave evidence			2
he said there could be more victims as @entity0 had power over his patients because he was in a position of trust as their neurosurgeon			1
mr @entity147 said : ' often they did tell family members about what took place and they were clearly upset by what took place , but they never came forward to police to explain what happened			0
' and i think that 's the power that this doctor had over them			0
he was in that position of trust			0
they doubted whether they would be believed , doubted whether it was medically justified what he had done			0
' they had questions , and that 's why it has taken so long for them to come forward			0
