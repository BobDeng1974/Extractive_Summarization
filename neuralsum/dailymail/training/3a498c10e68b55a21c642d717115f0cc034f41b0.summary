by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 01:32 est , 24 september 2013 ' missed opportunity ' : private @entity2 died in 2003 from heatstroke following a period of high temperatures in @entity6 army chiefs missed an opportunity to step in after a @entity11 soldier died from heatstroke when temperatures rose to above @entity14 in @entity6 , a coroner has said			1
private @entity2 , 32 , from @entity15 in the @entity16 was deployed in june 2003			1
he collapsed on august 13 that year with a fatally - high body temperature of @entity18 , having repeatedly told medical staff he was feeling unwell			1
he was taken to hospital but suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be saved			2
@entity22 , who serving with the @entity23 and was assigned to the @entity25 @entity24 , was stationed at the @entity27 athletics stadium on the western side of the city of @entity30			1
the inquest at @entity32 , the second to be held into @entity22 ’s death , heard conditions were tough in the disused stadium , described as a ' an unbearable , hot , dusty hell hole '			1
a number of soldiers said they felt unwell because of the conditions , the inquest heard			2
assistant coroner for @entity43 , recording her findings at the end of the five - day hearing , said : ' when climatic conditions deteriorated in august and the number of heat casualties increased , there was a missed opportunity to intervene			1
' she added that those in charge of the soldiers could have ' become more rigorous in monitoring individuals ' when temperatures soared , making sure they were treated for their symptoms and had enough rest			0
in her narrative conclusion , she described the circumstances as : ' death on active service overseas , involving a high tempo of operations in extreme temperatures , the risk of which would have been reduced by adherence to the then policy on heat illness , in terms of climatic monitoring , hydration , medical treatment and casualty reporting , and by the availability of air - conditioned accommodation and vehicles			2
' however , she added that it was not possible to prove that those factors ' specifically caused , or there was a direct causal link , between them and private @entity2 ’s sad death			1
' loss : ' @entity91 , pictured , and his fellow troops did not have air conditioning and were given ' inconsistent ' information on hydration , the inquest heard temperatures were at their seasonal maximum , and it became hot enough to fry eggs on a @entity101 in the days before @entity22 collapsed , his commanding officer lieutenant colonel @entity102 , who was a major at the time , told the hearing			1
soldiers also faced a ' punishing regime ' of working long hours , he added , with the inquest told there was only one medic to take care of 100 men			2
their accommodation was not air conditioned at the time of @entity22 ’s collapse			2
air conditioning units arrived there two days after his death			2
mrs @entity43 found that advice and information on hydration given to the soldiers serving in such arduous conditions was ' inconsistent ' and ' inadequate ' , but noted it had been stressed to them that drinking enough water was of utmost importance			0
she also said that medics had not been given forms to record reports of heat illness , and that not all medical consultations were recorded			0
the day before he died , @entity22 reported to the @entity11 medic with heat exhaustion and was advised to rest			1
that evening , he was deployed to a power station where he spent six hours in air - conditioned premises			0
the coroner said : ' the following day , he deployed twice to a petrol station but , before he was stood down at about 3pm , had spent some time in intense heat inside a @entity143 vehicle in full sun. ' she added that the time inside the vehicle was most likely the ' tipping point ' that led to @entity22 ’s deterioration			1
temperatures : the inquest , heard at @entity32 , pictured , heard how it was hot enough to fry eggs on a @entity101 at the time of the soldier 's death the inquest had also been told @entity22 had been deemed fit for his role in @entity6 and that the fact he had a relatively high body mass index of 34 would not have played a role in his death			1
he had also acclimatised to conditions in @entity6 by spending 10 days in @entity163 ahead of deployment , and his body had ' adapted reasonably well ' , mrs @entity43 said			0
@entity22 was described by @entity11 colleagues as a ' grafter ' who never shirked his duties			2
mrs @entity43 told his mother : ' it is important to realise what an important job he was doing , in these near - to - impossible conditions			0
' she also noted that heat illness is now dealt with in a different way by the @entity11 , adding that it was a ' changed world in terms of soldiering in heat in the last 10 years '			0
at the original inquest in 2006 , assistant deputy coroner for @entity181 recorded that @entity22 ’s death was caused ' by a serious failure to recognise and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate '			1
verdict : coroner @entity43 , pictured , said that those in charge of the soldiers could have ' become more rigorous in monitoring individuals ' in the extreme heat a second inquest was ordered by the @entity194 in 2010 after @entity22 ’s mother @entity195 successfully applied for a new public hearing , complying with the @entity197			1
mrs @entity198 , a grandmother - of - three , said she was glad to have fought for a second inquest on the grounds that the @entity201 should apply to troops serving abroad , but now it was over she could finally grieve the loss of her son			1
speaking after the inquest , mrs @entity198 said : ' i can live again , basically			1
i can now grieve , actually , and let it go			0
' when it ’s been ongoing , you just ca n’t do that			0
it ’s always on your mind			0
' and i ’ve heard things that have actually made me even more proud of my son from people , that i did n’t know before			0
' mrs @entity198 said she was pleased with the conclusion given by the coroner , adding that risks could have been avoided and that there had been ' a lack of following their own protocol '			1
mrs @entity198 said there had been failures ahead of her son ’s death in terms of the approach to heat - related illness , saying : ' in the situation they went into , it ’s something they did n’t predict , which possibly should have been predicted because of the time of year they were going in			1
' while the struggle to get all the answers has been long , mrs @entity198 said it had been worth it			2
she said : ' i feel i can now say i ’ve done what i can to prevent it happening to other families			0
describing her son , who had been in the @entity11 for 10 years and had completed a mechanics course shortly before his death , she said : ' @entity2 wanted to do what he wanted to do			2
he went out there to help people , which he did			0
' i never had anything against him doing what he wanted			0
it just so happened he was the one that did n’t come back with the group			0
' the coroner , who praised mrs @entity198 for her ' forbearance ' , also told her at the end of the hearing : ' it ’s been a long journey for you			1
i know nothing i say will replace the loss of @entity2			2
' i just hope it ’s been of some help in this hearing to hear from his mates , who were n’t there at the first inquest , and to realise , hearing from them , how @entity2 was so , so valuable to the team			1
