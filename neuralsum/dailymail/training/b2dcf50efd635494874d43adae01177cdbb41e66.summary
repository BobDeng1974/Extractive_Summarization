@entity2 president @entity1 ’s loyalists have paid tribute to @entity4 , describing the 69 - year - old @entity6 despot as a ‘ lovely man ’ , who ‘ was chosen by his people and regularly conducted elections ’			1
@entity12 , the secretary of administration for @entity1 ’s @entity14 , told @entity2 state radio : ‘ he was our great friend and we are not ashamed of being associated with him			1
’ the dead @entity6 leader was involved in the training and equipping of a para-military group in the @entity22 country in the early 1980s			1
popular leader : a loyalist of @entity1 , left , paid tribute to the dead @entity6 leader @entity4 , as his son , @entity27 , right , prepared to assume dual control of the country with his uncle @entity1 sought help to train the infamous @entity32 unit - which killed almost 20,000 people in an operation named @entity35 , meaning the first rains that wash the chaff			1
it has since been described as genocide			2
@entity4 played an instrumental role in training the crack special killer unit that operated outside normal @entity44 ( @entity44 ) command			2
but @entity45 , spokesman for the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , which was at the receiving end of the massacres , said his party had ' no option but to welcome ' the demise of the dictator			1
@entity53 , who will share power with his nephew , @entity27 , and the military he said : ' we will not shed any crocodile tears for the trainer of @entity35 , the only problem about his death is that it was before he could account for his actions , we are not apologetic about that			1
' meanwhile , in @entity66 citizens are observing three days of mourning in a show of solidarity for its fellow communist state			1
following his father 's death , @entity6 's new young leader will be @entity27 , who will rule the country alongside his uncle and the military , sources it was revealed today			1
@entity53 will work alongside his inexperienced and untested 28 - year - old nephew - the first time since the end of @entity81 a collective rather than a dictator from the family dynasty will be in charge			1
the army 's backing of @entity4 's third son , his proclaimed successor , has also calmed fears there could be a military coup			1
and it has prompted speculation there will now be a smooth transition of power - meaning little change for the millions of impoverished and poverty - stricken citizens			1
a source also revealed that the test - firing of a @entity6 missile on monday , following the announcement of @entity4 's death on saturday , was a warning shot against the @entity105 the source said : ' with the missile test , @entity6 wanted to deliver the message that they have the ability to protect themselves			2
' but @entity6 is unlikely to conduct a nuclear test in the near future unless provoked by the @entity105 and @entity114			1

three groups described the urgent need for food , reporting ' acute malnutrition ' among @entity6 children , ' widespread consumption of grass ' and elderly people on a ' knife edge '			2
there was ' substantial evidence ' of a growing food crisis for millions who live in the countryside - beyond the relative comfort of @entity129			2
' what we saw was extensive chronic malnutrition and cases of acute malnutrition , which is where the person is basically dying , ' said @entity161 , director of @entity6 's @entity162			2
he added : ' more than 50 per cent of people who are reliant on ( state - provided grain ) were out seeking out alternative food - things like bark , wild grass , and leaves - and mixing it in with food			2
we found there was no protein or fat in people ’s diets			2
' and when he returned in september , government grain rations had been cut by more than half to about 150 grams per day - the equivalent of one potato			2
alongside @entity4 's younger sister @entity180 , he is expected to guide the ' young general ' during his formative days in power			0
as part of the consolidation of power , security was stepped up in cities and troops put on high alert as @entity114 activists launched giant balloons containing tens of thousands of propaganda leaflets across the border			1
some showed graphic pictures of former @entity198 leader @entity197 's battered corpse and described his gruesome death			0

meanwhile , the young @entity4 on tuesday led a procession of senior officials in a viewing of @entity4 's body , which is being displayed in a glass coffin near that of @entity206			0
publicly presiding over the funeral proceedings was an important milestone for his successor , strengthening his image as the country 's political face at home and abroad			0
state media showed video of @entity27 receiving mourners , including foreign envoys , as he stood near his father 's body with an honour guard			0
he was sombre during the greetings , although footage at one point showed him teary - eyed			0
a report in the @entity6 's official @entity242 did not specify which foreign countries the envoys represented			0
according to official media , more than five million @entity6 have gathered at monuments and memorials in the capital since the death of @entity4			0
hundreds of thousands visited monuments around the city within hours of the official announcement that @entity4 had died			0

a book of condolences was opened at the @entity6 embassy in @entity283 , with a big photo of the dead leader and flowers in the entrance			0
@entity66 and @entity6 are two of the world 's last communist nations and have maintained good relations since establishing diplomatic ties in 1960 , the year after @entity288 took power in a 1959 revolution on the @entity297 island			0
they were both on the @entity105 list of state sponsors of terrorism until @entity6 was removed in 2008			0
protest : @entity114 activists have been sending propaganda balloons over the border up and away : some of the balloons showed graphic pictures of former @entity198 leader @entity197 's battered corpse and described his gruesome death @entity66 is facing its own succession issues as it approaches a generational leadership change without much new blood waiting in the wings			1
@entity66 was ruled for 49 years by @entity288 , 85 , who was succeeded by brother and then first vice president @entity314 in 2008			0
under the constitution , if @entity314 were to leave office tomorrow , 81 - year - old @entity315 , current first vice president of the ruling @entity274 , would succeed him until 2013 , although he could be replaced sooner			0
government opponents said they feared @entity66 leaders could circumvent the constitution and follow @entity6 's lead by quickly replacing @entity315 with a @entity288 family member			0
but other @entity66 discounted the possibility that the government would put another @entity288 in power , saying the @entity66 system would not permit it			0
