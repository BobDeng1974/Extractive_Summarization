the sound of screeching music : @entity6 was fined and ordered to stay out of the @entity21 for two years @entity6 was charged under a 173 - year - old law with using a ' noisy instrument ' in a public place for the purpose of obtaining money			1
but @entity6 insists it was his disability , rather than his playing , that was upsetting people			1
@entity30 , defending , said : ' my parents used to think that @entity33 were making a screeching noise			2
' it is a matter of opinion what screeching is			0
' @entity6 , who has lived in the @entity40 for 10 months , lost his legs in an accident when he was child , @entity39 heard			0
' on july 19 at about 3.45pm the defendant was outside @entity8 in @entity9 playing a recorder type instrument which makes a high pitched screeching noise , ' said prosecutor @entity46 out of tune : @entity6 busked outside @entity8 store in @entity10 's @entity9 ' the defendant was placing himself in a prominent place blocking the flow of pedestrians on the pavement and the pedestrians were seen to be recoiling from him			1
' he should n't have been in the place where he was blocking the flow on a busy street			0
' ms @entity30 said people were not moving away from him because of the noise he was making but because he was ' somebody who was using the skateboard as his feet '			1

district judge @entity78 told @entity6 , who wheeled himself into court on his skateboard : ' there are very significant problems from begging in this area in @entity10 because so many people are doing it			1
' there is no doubt that it is a big problem			0
what the prosecution are saying to me is that you are a problem			0
' it is clear to me that the way that you beg whether it is playing your recorder or whatever does cause harassment			2
' i do not accept that this was to do with your disability or being on a skateboard but that they were just being harassed by your behaviour			2
' it seems to me that there is pretty good evidence that you are living on the proceeds of begging and busking			0
' you are probably making good income from begging and busking			0
