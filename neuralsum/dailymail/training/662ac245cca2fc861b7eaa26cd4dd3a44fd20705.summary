the firm , which was organising @entity0 's planned comeback concerts in @entity46 , claims it was not responsible for the star 's decision to employ @entity42 as his doctor			2
dr @entity16 confirmed from his autopsy that @entity0 's skin became lighter in the 1980s owing to ' vitiligo , a skin pigmentation disease			1
' he added : ' so some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark			0
' the doctor also confirmed that an overdose of propofol killed the pop star although several other types of sedative administered by @entity42 the same morning contributed to his death			0
expert : medical examiner , dr @entity16 testified during dr. @entity42 's involuntary manslaughter trial in october 2011 and appeared in court again yesterday in the trial brought by the @entity72 against concert promoter @entity12 @entity74 , a lawyer for @entity75 , asked the deputy medical examiner for @entity8 : ' would a fit , competent doctor administer propofol for insomnia ?
