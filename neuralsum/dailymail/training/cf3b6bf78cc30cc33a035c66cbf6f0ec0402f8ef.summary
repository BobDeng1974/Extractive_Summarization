spooky footage claims to have captured the ghost of a long - dead lord mayor communicating with paranormal investigators			2
experts caught the eerie interactions on camera during a guided tour of the @entity8 , which is renowned for its apparently unexplained sightings			1
the team from @entity11 claimed to have noticed several elements of what they believe to be spiritual activity as they watched the footage back after the tour last month			1
there have been previous claims of ghostly sightings on the main staircase , the library and the @entity39 lecture theatre and the team , made up of four investigators and 17 members of the public , claim to have made contact with @entity45 , the lord mayor of liverpool from 1907 - 1908 - who died in 1926			1
their investigation began by identifying areas within the 19th century grade ii - listed building as potential hotspots for activity			2
@entity52 , from @entity11 , said : ' as a rule of thumb , we always begin by simply asking if there are any spirits that wish to communicate with us			0
' when we reached the medical library we set up electro - magnetic field sensors , known as rempods , on the outer side of the room			0
detection : @entity52 , from @entity11 , claimed that the electro - magnetic sensors in the medical library picked up a signal , pictured , from @entity45 , lord mayor of @entity66 ' if we did make contact , then the sensor should detect the electro - magnetic field that all spirits possess and set off an audible alarm with flashing lights - but it is very rare for this device to react			1
' the walls are covered with portraits of past significant bodies and we started by asking for the people in the portraits to step toward the device			0
' after calling for @entity45 , lord mayor of liverpool in 1908 , the alarms went off			1
' we continued to direct questions to @entity45 for two hours and have documented evidence of seventeen occurences in which the rempod was set off			2
' and spookily , each time this happened the temperature would drop by a staggering five degrees just before			0
' on the case : the team at @entity11 , pictured , claim to have made contact with @entity45 , the lord mayor of liverpool from 1907 - 1908 - who died in 1926 another part of the footage claims to show a ghostly orb at the foot of the main staircase , where others are said to have seen ghostly figures of a man and his dog			1
the light anomaly seems to appear out of thin air before crossing the path of the group and disappearing again			0
a member of the team walks straight past the orb and appears not to notice it			0
ms @entity52 claimed that the orb was too bright and intense to be dust , and that if it had been an insect there would have been a specific flight path and shape .			0
