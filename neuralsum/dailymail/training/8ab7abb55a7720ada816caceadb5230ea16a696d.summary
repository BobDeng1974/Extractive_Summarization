by @entity0 @entity1 have taken the extraordinary step of firing their goalkeeper , after his gaffes gifted @entity5 a 2 - 1 win in the @entity8 league on sunday			1
the inexperienced keeper , @entity9 , who is only 23 years old , was shown no mercy by the @entity12 club			1
the club are one of the most popular in @entity8 , along with @entity15 , but the defeat left them just a point above the relegation zone			2
down and out : @entity9 was given the boot after making one mistake too many for @entity1 @entity1 are notorious for their ruthlessness , and have changed managers so frequently over the last few years that they make @entity24 look like having the patience of a saint			0
in total , they have changed their head coach 14 times since 2008 , with new boss @entity31 replacing former @entity32 and @entity34 manager @entity33 ' @entity35 earlier this month			0
