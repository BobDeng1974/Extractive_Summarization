@entity0 laughs at the suggestion that professional rugby ’s academy system puts too much pressure on players to bulk up			1
in a month when the @entity8 ’s treasured academy system has come in for some heavy flak - with @entity10 and @entity11 among the high - profile critics of the northern hemisphere ’s apparent obsession with size over skill - saracens ’ ‘ @entity16 ’ take a very different view			1
‘ yes ’ it was tough , they say			1
‘ yes ’ at times the exercise regime bordered on " madness "			1
but was the pain endured in the gym and on the training ground worth it ? they think so			1
@entity27 of 2008 : academy graduates ( from left ) @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity0 and @entity33 , who are now shining for the north @entity36 club in the senior and international ranks ‘ i enjoyed it , ’ said @entity0 , one of five current @entity40 first - team regulars who joined the club in 2008 and went through the @entity41 together			1
‘ it was hard , but i needed it			2
‘ i remember doing twice as much in pre-season as the first team did			2
we needed to get to where they were			2
we did two skills sessions a day when they ’d do one			2
we did more weights too			2
‘ there was a reason for it			2
we needed to get up to their standard			2
i enjoyed it and we enjoyed it as a group			2
as a group we pushed each other pretty well			2
it ’s half the reason that we ’re here now			2
’ there are nods of agreement around the table in a hospitality box at @entity67 as @entity0 ’s team - mates and friends @entity30 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity31 concur with the @entity71 fly - half			1
the demands on a modern - professional rugby player are enormous			2
no - one doubts that			2
the game is more physical than it has ever been , the ball is in play longer than it has ever been , and the collisions are greater than they have ever been			0
it is a tough , uncompromising professional sport still finding its way both on and off the field after the transition from an amateur game in 1995			0
academies are a product of the age			1
‘ the best thing was the culture we created within the @entity41 itself , ’ said @entity33 , who now has 106 first - team appearances			1
@entity0 is hugely supportive of the demanding academy system which made him the player he is ‘ the only pressure was the pressure we put on each other			1
we set standards of pushing each other hard and doing the extras to try to be the best			0
‘ that takes the pressure off			0
you only feel pressure if you do n’t work hard enough			0
the reason we ’re all here is because we worked hard when we were younger and are still working hard today			0
’ as scouting and junior representative selection processes have improved , academies have formed the bridge between life on the inside of professional rugby and life on the outside			1
not every player in the top - flight goes through the system , but it is increasingly rare to find players such as @entity120 and @entity122 ’s @entity121 , who slip through the net			1
‘ it was tough , but a massive part of it was actually not to do with the physical side , ’ said flanker @entity31 , a schoolboy hammer thrower from @entity125 who took rugby up aged 14 and was signed by @entity40 two years later			1
‘ it ’s more to do with the mental side			0
[ former @entity40 coach ] @entity134 was tough on a lot of people			1
but it was what made us who we are now			0
we were in at 6.30 in the morning , getting up at 5am			0
‘ it was part of the learning experience that you need to go through			0
we were in first and out last			0
some of the training sessions were just mental			0
but they needed to be			0
you ca n’t compare now to then			0
’ @entity31 ( second from left ) says their academy education was mental as much as it was physical all five men agree that , five years after they were in the system , the academies have improved			1
whereas they trained in isolation from the first - team , today ’s crop - which includes 6ft 5in , 18 stone @entity156 captain @entity155 - are fully integrated with the first team in order to smooth the transition between the two			0
@entity120 , @entity10 and many others argue more emphasis should be placed on skills at the expense of weights lifted			0
earlier this month @entity8 chief executive @entity166 admitted he was concerned about doping in the sport among junior players with more rugby players currently serving suspensions than any other sport			0
none of those suspensions have been in the professional game , but @entity166 ’s concern is shared by some			0
‘ we all go through different stages of growth and if people are putting pressure on you to do it [ dope ] my message to them is that it ’s not worth it , ’ says recent @entity71 cap @entity30 , 24 , who shed his nickname of ‘ @entity178 ’ after adding two stone in his first season in the @entity41 under the direction of strength and conditioning coach and former @entity41 team - mate @entity184			1
@entity32 , who would surely be an @entity71 regular by now if were not for an horrendous run of injuries , adds : ‘ if you want to get big then there are proper ways to do it			1
as @entity33 said , you can get one lad who is huge at 14 and one kid who is tiny who then suddenly overtakes him			1
you ’ve just got to let nature take its course			0
@entity214 's ' @entity213 ' ( from second left after youth team coach @entity205 ) @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 proved you could win with kids ‘ you ’ve got five lads here who have been through a whole junior and senior @entity41 and not a single one of us have ever come close to it [ doping ] or had it mentioned to us			1
’ the five men are firm friends as well as team - mates			0
@entity31 recently became the first to have a child when his girlfriend @entity226 gave birth to @entity228			1
‘ we share each other ’s happiness on and off the field , ’ @entity33 says			1
the quintet have a been at the club during a period of unparalleled success which has seen them win the @entity238 for the first time in 2011 , as well as reaching two other domestic league finals , while last season they reached the @entity242 final for the first time in the club ’s history , only to be blown away by a @entity248 driven @entity247 machine			1
it hardly stands comparison to @entity214 ’s legendary ‘ @entity213 ’ , but with time on their side and an apparent desire to remain at the club they joined as teenagers the potential for this group is enormous			1
@entity0 takes in a breather as @entity40 scrape past @entity260 25 - 23 on saturday wing @entity261 ( centre ) celebrates scoring a try with scrum - half @entity264 ‘ it would be incredible to get to the end of our careers and be able to look back and say : “ i ’ve spent my entire rugby journey with the same group of lads ”			1
‘ we ’re friends for life anyway , but to have that connection throughout our whole careers would be very , very rare and something i ’ll try to hold on to			0
’ the five head in to the @entity279 with much work to do			0
the north @entity281 lie fourth in the @entity282 following yesterday ’s 25 - 23 victory at @entity260 while they must win at home to @entity285 and away to @entity286 to stand a realistic chance of qualifying from the toughest of @entity290 pools			0
but they will do so with the tightest five the @entity238 has seen			0
five who , fitnessand form permitting , could still be at @entity67 for many years to come .			0

@entity0 , @entity30 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity31 are all products of the @entity41 system
@entity0 said ' at times the exercise regime bordered on madness '
@entity301 legend @entity300 and @entity302 @entity11 have criticised an apparent northern hemisphere obsession with size over skill
all five @entity40 stars agree the academies have improved since their time
