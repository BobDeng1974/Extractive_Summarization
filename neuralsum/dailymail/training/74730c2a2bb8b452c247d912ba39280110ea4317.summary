by @entity1 reporter published : 14:42 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 20:47 est , 5 november 2013 initiative : @entity3 computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report @entity9 activity @entity3 computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report @entity9 activity			1
the new site , @entity12 , will encourage victims , or even former mobsters , to relay information to police , anti-mafia magistrates and journalists without fear of reprisal			1
@entity12 is aimed at people such as shopkeepers or business owners forced to pay protection money , as well as members of the public who have uncovered mafia activity and former criminals who want to spill the beans on their bosses or partners			1
based on the @entity34 website , information provided to the site is directed through an anonymous coded network , to protect the identity of informants , and is then passed on to sources such as the police			1
the volunteers behind the new site have also kept their own identities a secret in order to protect themselves against any possible retaliation from those exposed by @entity12			1
' there are fewer than 10 of us , with families , ' one of those behind the operation told @entity3 newspaper @entity53			0
' everything we do to do with @entity12 we do after work , using money from our own pockets			0
' a message on the website , which was down in ' maintenance mode ' today , proclaimed that the purpose of the site was to collect information on mafia activity directly , with words in @entity67 reading ' if you know something , say something '			2
the site is accessible to anyone , with informants making their anonymous reports to ' receivers '			1
site users are directed to one of three categories - ' whistleblowers ' , for those inside the mafia clans , ' victims ' , and ' know something ' , for those who have become aware mafia activity			2
they are encouraged to provide documentation of their claims , such as photographs , audio clips and other data			0
the information is then sent on to ' trusted persons ' , who will receive an alert that it has been posted			0
it is hoped that the list of trusted persons will include prominent law enforcement officers , journalists and anti-mafia campaigners			0
volunteers hope that the site could provide information such as the location of @entity9 bosses in hiding , or those behing extortion rackets			1
origins : the @entity9 emerged in the 19th century , with activity prevalent in more prosperous areas such as the capital @entity109 however , there have been fears raised that the site could be abused by those involved in organised crime , and that mafioso themselves could deliberately give false information to confuse investigators			1
magistrate @entity118 told @entity53 : ' @entity119 could be a good way of spreading a certain type of information and shattering the wall of silence			0
' however , he also said it could be used to mask ' desires for vengeance '			0
also known as @entity9 , which translates as ' our thing ' , the @entity9 emerged in @entity131 in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct			2
groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection			0
it has been estimated that the @entity9 costs the region 's economy more than â‚¬ 10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of @entity131 businesses pay some sort of protection money			2
politicians have also been accused of using the @entity9 to buy votes during elections .			0

site is based on @entity34 and is accessible to anyone
volunteers *remaining* anonymous to protect themselves from retaliation
