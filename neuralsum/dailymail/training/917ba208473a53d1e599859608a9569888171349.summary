eighteen months ago , at @entity3 ’s @entity2 , @entity1 cricket enjoyed one of the most pleasurably unexpected test wins in its history			2
much has been made of the contribution to that victory of @entity11 , and understandably so : here was proof of what , by then , was becoming a cliche – that he was a player of great innings , if not necessarily a great player			0
but the unexpectedness resided mainly in the fact that @entity19 had outspun @entity20 – and that they did so after @entity20 ’s captain @entity21 had called , with a tone of voice that sounded dangerously close to enthusiasm , for a turning track			1
on the outside looking in : @entity19 have problems in the spin department now @entity29 has retired @entity29 had match figures of eight for 113 , and @entity31 11 for 210			1
between them , and despite @entity20 ’s batsmen having first use of the pitch , @entity32 , @entity33 and an over-the - hill @entity34 managed nine for 400			1
the world had gone mad			0
those unearthly few days came to mind this week as we surveyed the domestic scene a month into the first season after the retirement of @entity29			1
and the fact was this : as play resumed on monday morning in the sixth round of @entity50 matches , not a single spinner sat in the top 10 of the @entity54 bowling averages			1
highest in the list was @entity57 ’s @entity56 off - spinner @entity58 , whose 14 wickets at 25 placed him 12th			1
@entity61 came @entity62 , the @entity64 slow left - armer who has yet to shake off the stigma of his ashes meltdown at @entity68			0
he was 23rd , with 10 wickets at 27			0
the situation was slightly rosier in @entity71 , where @entity73 ’s left - armer @entity72 ( 18 at 17 ) was third in the averages , and @entity76 ’s offie @entity75 ( 14 at 19 ) was 10th			0
and if the 22 - year - old @entity75 fits neatly into the ‘ one to watch ’ category , @entity77 is 36			0
with the best will in @entity80 , he will never play for @entity19			1
april and may have never been auspicious months for @entity1 spinners			0
june is n’t great either			0
july is reasonable , because pitches have started to dry out , but august is when the slow bowlers start to cash in			0
this august , there will be one full round of @entity50 matches			0
the dice have always been loaded against @entity1 spinners – or at least they have been since the advent of covered pitches			0
yet , as @entity19 seek to embark on the @entity93 era , it is troubling that this should still be the case			2
@entity29 ’s five - year test career allowed @entity1 cricket to pretend there was not a problem , while the bowler himself allowed the test team to play a four - man attack			1
and because he gave the ball such a rip , he could take the moral high ground when it came to questioning the legitimacy of deliveries he did n’t need , such as the doosra			0
but he might just as easily have been called @entity109 instead of @entity29 : this particular @entity29 ’s progress has been the exception , not the rule			2
it was no coincidence that @entity29 learned his trade on the turning tracks of @entity116 , before honing it on less helpful surfaces at @entity119			1
one taught him how to attack , the other how to defend : unusually among @entity1 spinners , he spent his @entity121 career doing both			0
second spinners : @entity64 's @entity62 ( left ) has 10 wickets at 21 in @entity54 , while @entity75 has 14 at 19 , but they have been taken in @entity71 for @entity76 for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin yet counties no longer produce turners , for fear of producing pitches marked ‘ poor ’ and ripe for the penalising			1
and so we had the curious situation last summer in which dryness was to be found at @entity121 venues only , the better to help @entity29 beat @entity138			2
and he obliged , with 26 wickets at 29 each			0
in 2015 , @entity19 wo n’t be able to try the same trick , because a combination of dodgy weather , questionable scheduling , seaming surfaces that increase a county ’s chance of a result , and our traditional suspicion of anyone who bowls more slowly than 75mph ( or more quickly than 90 ) will have regressed our cricket to its mean – to a world in which the spinner is tolerated rather than nurtured			1
there is talk this summer of producing bouncier tracks to defeat @entity158 and @entity20 , and it may well work			1
@entity31 may fill in for a few games , before the debate reopens about his batting and fielding			0
but none of it will change the fact that , with @entity29 now out of the way , @entity1 cricket ’s chickens are coming home to roost			1
clear your diaries ! pity the cricketers of @entity20			2
with the @entity175 final taking place on june 1 , and their flight to @entity19 leaving on june 22 , the three - week hiatus looked like the perfect time to count earnings and recharge batteries			1
except that the @entity181 have decided to use the downtime to play a – what else ! – three - match one - day series in @entity185			0
one of the consequences of leading the putsch at the @entity188 earlier this year was that @entity20 had to throw sweeteners this way and that to get the vote through			2
three games in five days in @entity193 in mid-june , so keeping the @entity195 ’s tv partners in clover , was one of the conditions			0
and @entity20 are taking the trip so seriously that both @entity21 and @entity200 will sit it out			2
the administrators must be proud			0
on their knees : the @entity20 team could be very tired by the time they land in @entity19 in late june in @entity206 10 days ago , umpire @entity205 refused to refer a run - out appeal against @entity11 to his tv colleague			1
replays showed @entity11 was out by a foot , and @entity213 captain @entity212 ’s repeated requests for a replay proved in vain			0
@entity205 later put this strangeness down to ‘ a human error ’			0
now , he has been removed from the @entity175 ’s umpiring panel			1
according to the @entity175 chairman @entity221 , ‘ there are many reasons ’			2
whatever can he mean ? so , the @entity223 are going to take charge of cricket ’s anti-corruption drive ? will that be the same @entity223 that is headed up by @entity227 , who has been instructed by @entity20 ’s @entity228 to step down as @entity181 president while investigations continue into the @entity175 spot - fixing scandal that occurred under his watch ? yes , it would			1
as @entity19 subsided to 88 all out against the @entity236 in @entity237 last month , it was widely agreed that they had missed a calm head , a wise old bird who would have taken one look at a target of 134 on a slow pitch and decided to milk his way to victory			2
sitting on the sidelines throughout the @entity248 , of course , was @entity249 , who reminded everyone of his class on friday by making 50 off 34 balls on a dog of a pitch in @entity255 against @entity256			2
the start of a new era can also mean @entity249 reclaiming responsibility at the top of the @entity248 order			1
sweeping statement : @entity249 's innings against @entity256 reminded @entity19 of his limited - overs prowess we may have given the impression two weeks ago that @entity267 – one - time slayer of @entity269 – was a busted flush , incapable of getting the ball off the square and emblematic of a @entity274 franchise that was too busy admiring all its big - hitters to actually get out there and win games of cricket			1
we now realise we owe @entity267 an apology			1
in sunday ’s game against @entity281 , @entity267 rolled back the clock to thrash 83 off 38 balls , then took four wickets with his left - arm pies			1
all was right with the world – until @entity287 and @entity288 added 85 in 5.2 overs to nick it for the @entity281			0
still , one step at a time …			0

none of top 10 bowlers in @entity295 is a spinner
@entity29 let @entity19 pretend there was *n't* a problem in spin department
counties no longer produce turning tracks *due* to fear of punishment
@entity20 's stars could be *knackered* by the time they get to @entity19
there has been some questionable umpiring at the @entity175
@entity223 to take over cricket 's anti-corruption drive
@entity249 is the perfect limited - overs solution for @entity19
@entity267 *deserves* an apology from the @entity319 ( well , sort of )
