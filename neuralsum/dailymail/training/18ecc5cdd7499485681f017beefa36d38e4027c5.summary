by @entity0 these remarkable pictures show the ‘ giraffe women ’ of eastern @entity3			0
these @entity5 women , from @entity6 , wear brass coils around their necks to give the impression that their necks are stretched			1
having a long neck is often seen as beautiful in @entity5 culture			2
the @entity5 women of eastern @entity3 wear brass rings around their necks to make them appear longer they can start wearing the rings from the age of five and tend to add more rings as they get older while the neck rings make the women ’s necks appear long , in reality , the weight of the coils pushes down the muscles around the collarbone and compresses the rib cage - meaning their necks appear longer than they are			1
the women – who can start wearing the rings from the age of five - have a long piece of brass wound in a spiral around their necks			1
the metal is wound manually by the women and , as brass is tough , this process can take many hours			0
a full set of the neck rings can weigh as much as 10 kilos - but few of the women now wear a full set			1
most women gradually increase the number of coils on their rings to steadily increase the apparent length of their necks			2
despite the weight of the rings , the women wearing them experience little restriction to their movement			0
the rings do not actually stretch the women 's necks - the weight pushes down their collarbones and compresses their rib cages making their necks appear longer the women can remove the rings but they tend not to as it can be uncomfortable and the skin underneath tends to be discoloured and , as the coiling and uncoiling process takes so long , the women rarely remove the rings – they usually only do so to replace them with a longer version			1
the coils can be safely removed even though the muscles underneath are weakened			0
however , many women prefer not to have them removed as their necks and collarbones are left bruised and discoloured underneath and they suffer discomfort when they are removed			0
additionally , when they have been wearing the rings for a long time , many of the women say they feel they have become an integral part of their bodies and they feel ' naked ' without them			0
the rings are made of long pieces of brass that are wrapped around the neck to form coils many of the women say that if they remove the rings they feel naked and vulnerable it is not known why the women started wearing the rings but there are many theories after a few days of not wearing the rings , the discomfort fades , but the discolouration tends to remain			1
it is not clear exactly how the tradition of wearing the neck rings came about			2
there are theories that women wore them to protect against tiger bites or that they were worn to make them look more like the dragons of local legends			0
other people believe they started wearing them to make themselves less attractive to other tribes so they were less likely to be taken into slavery			2
some people believe women originally wore the rings to protect themselves from tiger bites - other people think they were designed to make them unattractive so they were less likely to be taken into slavery now , most of the women wear the rings because they are seen as beautiful and to preserve the tradition some women wear the rings because they attract tourists and tourists bring vital revenue to the community however , when asked , most of the women will now say they wear them to preserve their cultural identities			1
kayan women are usually now given a choice as to whether or not they want to wear the neck rings			2
most of those who still do , do so because they see them as beautiful or because they want to preserve the tradition			0
it is also likely that some wear them because they attract tourists who bring vital revenue to the community			0
the rings are wound around the women 's necks and this can take several hours as the brass is very tough surprisingly , the rings do not significantly restrict the women 's movement a full set of the neck rings can weigh up to 10 kilos but few women wear these any longer			1

the @entity5 women wear coils around their necks to make them look longer
their necks are not actually stretched - the weight of the brass pushes down the muscles around their collarbones and compresses their ribs
this makes their necks look longer than they actually are
it is not known why the women originally started wearing the neck rings
now they do so as it is considered beautiful and to preserve the tradition
a full set of the neck rings can weigh as much as 10 kilos
