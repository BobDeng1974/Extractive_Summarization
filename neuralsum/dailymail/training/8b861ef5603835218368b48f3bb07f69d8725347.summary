his dramatic post-court speech , in which he announced he had saved @entity3 's life , drew gasps almost as loud as those that came when the jury found his client not guilty of murdering her young daughter			1
it was a rather bold statement to make by defence lawyer of the moment @entity13 , who has been called ' the luckiest man in @entity15 ' by one lawyer			1
@entity13 was chosen by @entity3 to represent her ' at random ' , court tapes revealed , after she heard his name mentioned by other prison inmates			1
it was a choice many questioned at the time - both among her family and in the legal profession			0
' in taking on the job of attempting to clear @entity37 of murder charges related to the death of her two - year - old daughter @entity3 , @entity13 went from being a small - time local lawyer to the defence attorney in the most high - profile case in @entity15			1
@entity44 , one of the three prosecutors who led the case against @entity37 , announced tonight that he will retire at the end of the week			0
mr @entity44 , 53 , has prosecuted for the @entity50 - @entity49 state attorney 's office for 30 years			1
his reputation and experience was in stark contrast to that of @entity13 , @entity37 's lead defence attorney , who was admitted to the @entity55 only three years ago			1
in 2008 , when the decision went public , @entity56 , the president of the @entity57 , was shocked			0
' i first said , " @entity13 who ? " @entity56 told @entity61			2
' i had no idea who he was			0
' @entity13 , 42 , a @entity64 veteran , took almost a decade simply to start practising as a professional lawyer			1
despite graduating from law school in 1997 , he was was perennially denied entry to the @entity69 bar until 2005 - because he refused to pay child support to his former wife or secure life and health insurance for his teenage daughter			1
@entity75 : @entity13 clings tight to @entity37 as they await today 's verdict victory for them both : @entity80 and @entity13 hug after she is found not guilty today relief : @entity3 clings on and cries as @entity13 looks proudly ahead he had previously declared himself bankrupt and defaulted on loans , according to an order by the @entity84			1
as a result , he was barred from the bar for eight years , because , according to the @entity69 @entity84 , the financial marks on his name showed ' a lack of respect for the rights of others and a total lack of respect for the legal system , which is absolutely inconsistent with the character and fitness qualities required of those seeking to be afforded the highest position of trust and confidence recognised by our system of law			2
' ' it kind of happened at random in booking			0
' i heard a couple of people talking about attorneys ... his name came up and i said if he 's good , can you do me a favour and pass my name along ' @entity3 on why she hired @entity13 the decision to hire @entity13 was also criticised by @entity37 's family			1
in jail house tapes from july 2008 played to the court , @entity37 , @entity80 's brother , warned her to switch attorneys			1
understand your rights in this ... if at any point you want to change jockeys in this horse race , you can do it … it 's as simple as you reaching out to anyone in the @entity130 … and make it known on what you want to do , ' he told his sister			0
her father @entity134 added : ' i just , i hope that the compassion that he says that he has is being genuine … i hope he 's not building a reputation for himself			0
' when @entity37 probed her on how she came to hire @entity13 , @entity80 explained : ' it kind of happened at random in booking			1
' i heard a couple of people talking about attorneys ... his name came up and i said if he 's good , can you do me a favour and pass my name along … it was an inmate and there was three other people that confirmed it			1
' in court , @entity13 faced much media criticism for what appeared to be a series of bold and dangerous moves , which could have scuppered his defence case			2
he was slammed , in particular , almost daily by notorious host @entity157 for his choice of argument in court and for ' relishing in the spotlight ' outside of it , supposedly using the case as an opportunity for fame			0
in his opening statements , @entity13 stunned onlookers by claiming his client had lied all along about what had happened to her daughter			2
furious : @entity157 has continually argued against @entity13 's tactics in court she was no longer arguing that a nanny had taken her for a month before her disappearance was reported but that a tragic accident in her parents ' swimming pool led to them attempting to cover up little @entity3 's death			1
@entity13 then told the court she had lied because of psychological problems that stemmed from @entity80 having been sexually abused by her father - a claim he completely denied			1
' you ca n't say they won because of @entity13 but i guess you can say they won in spite of @entity13 ' @entity157 on the verdict once the new story was established , @entity13 essentially backed himself into a corner , critics argued			2
the only witness who could corroborate these bold claims was @entity80 herself and legal experts almost always warn against bringing one 's client to the stand			1
as it transpired , the claims were never backed up and @entity80 did not give evidence			2
@entity13 was heavily criticised throughout the case by notorious host @entity157 and was labelled ' incompetent ' on one of her shows			2
speaking with defence attorney @entity204 about testimony instigated by @entity13 that @entity3 's remains may have been tampered with by woodland animals , @entity157 said : ' you know what ? maybe it was a dingo dog or @entity211 or @entity211 or a martian ! ' you know what ? i really think -- you know , i see you laughing , but here`s the deal			1
. the defence can`t laugh			0
they 've done it now			0
they can sit there and laugh in open court			0
what were they thinking ? a coyote did it ? ' different : @entity13 was criticised for using so many posters and charts in court @entity204 responded : ' we`re seeing is an entire team , not just mr @entity13 , their incompetency			2
' after the not guilty verdict was announced today , @entity157 said rather ungraciously : ' you ca n't say they won because of @entity13 but i guess you can say they won in spite of @entity13			2
' @entity13 had been practising as a lawyer for just three years when he was booked by @entity37			1
in his highest profile case before the @entity37 trial , he defended a @entity245 , a man accused of killing the granddaughter of a boxer			0
after @entity245 was convicted of manslaughter , the client filed a motion arguing that @entity13 was a defective attorney , although his motion was denied			2
while he was waiting to be admitted to the bar he worked with two bikini businesses - @entity253 and @entity255 - @entity254 , which are both now inactive			2
he also worked for not for profit organisations which fought to prevent domestic violence and child abuse			0
while his profile has soared since the @entity37 trial began , @entity13 's financial troubles have not ceased			1
' saved a life ' : @entity13 addresses the media after the historic result his home was in foreclosure last year , according to reports , and it is unclear how he was paid to represent @entity37 , although money from sales of pictures and footage of @entity3 are thought to have contributed			1
' he 's a guy with a colourful and complicated past and a very confusing present , ' @entity30 , a lawyer and professor at @entity273 told @entity61 during the case			0
' his courtroom demeanour leaves you with a sense that this is a guy who is in over his head			0
' he 's really flying by the seat of his pants			0
from his very confusing open , from the way he 's been cross examining witnesses , at this point , you really have to wonder what his strategy is			0
' despite all the criticism , however , today 's result is an undoubted milestone success for the attorney - which is perhaps why he so basked in the moment			0
turnaround : @entity13 won despite claims he took the job for fame as the clerk of the court read the verdicts , @entity37 hugged @entity13 and soon after began to cry			0
later , as the judge spoke to the jury , she could be seen mouthing ' thank you ' to him , before the whole defence team hugged in tears like a victorious sports team as the session ended			0
in a bizarre speech given after the case in both @entity314 and @entity315 , @entity13 appeared shaken with emotion as he shamelessly declared that his defence had ‘ saved a life ’			1
he told the media he was ‘ very happy for @entity80			0
i ’m ecstatic for her and i want her to be able to grieve and grow and somehow get her life back together ’ but spent much of the speech focussed on how the moment felt for him			0
he used to opportunity to speak out against @entity80 ’s ‘ trial by media ’ and the death penalty , which he labelled ‘ disgusting ’ , before saying : ‘ i want to thank everyone who stood behind me and supported me throughout this time			0
’ the speech then reached its climax as , holding back tears , @entity13 declared he was especially proud that when he went home this evening his daughter ‘ will ask me what did you do today and i can say i saved a life			1

' i saved a life ' says @entity80 lawyer
