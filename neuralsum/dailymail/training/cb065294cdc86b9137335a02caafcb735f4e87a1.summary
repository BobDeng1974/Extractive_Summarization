scientists from the @entity1 may found evidence that plants can ' talk ' each other using microscopic sounds			1
a study looking into how chilli plants grow has discovered that when seedlings are put next to so - called ' friendly ' plants , they grow stronger			1
yet , when the seedlings were put near ' bad neighbours ' , such as fennel , germination was hindered			0
dr. @entity14 and her research team at the @entity1 studied how chilli plant seedlings reacted when placed near other plants , such as basil and fennel			1
@entity20 encouraged the seeds to grow , whereas fennel hindered development			1
scientists believe this could be due to microscopic sounds the research team put one lot of chilli seeds in a locked container with basil , and then fennel			1
another lot were left to grow outside			2
in both cases , the chilli seeds sprouted and grew when the basil neighbour was present , and were hindered by the presence of fennel			2
this suggests that the development differences had little to do with the growing environment , and more to do with how the plants interact with one another the experiment was set up to block all possible known means of communication between plants , including chemical and light signals , and physical contact			2
chilli seeds were planted in isolated dishes around an adult basil plant that was either left open to the elements , or sealed in a cylindrical box covered in black plastic			2
the cylinder blocked all airborne chemical signals , and all wavelengths of light			0
as a comparison , other seeds were planted around a cylinder that was left empty			0
more of the chilli seeds sprouted and grew when the basil neighbour was present , whether or not the plant was masked and cut off from them			2
sounds generated by microscopic movements within plant cells might be the key to the mystery , the scientists suspect			1
the team , lead by researcher dr @entity14 , found that sprouting chilli plants grow more successfully next to ' friendly ' neighbour , which in the chilli plant 's case was an adult basil plant			1
yet place them next a neighbour from hell , such as fennel , and germination is held back			0
the study even discovered that the plants recognise what kind of plant lives next door when they are still seeds			0
@entity14 said : ' our results show that plants are able to positively influence the growth of seeds by some as yet unknown mechanism			0
' bad neighbours , such as fennel , prevent chilli seed germination in the same way			0
' we believe that the answer may involve acoustic signals generated using nanomechanical oscillations from inside the cell which allow rapid communication between nearby plants			1
' @entity108 is a bad plant neighbour because it competes aggressively , releasing chemicals that stunt the growth of its rivals			1
@entity20 , on the other hand , produces helpful chemicals that keep out weeds and act as natural insect pest killers			0
when the basil plant , pictured left , was near the chilli plant the seeds grew stronger because basil produces helpful chemicals that keep weeds out			0
alternatively , fennel , pictured right , competes ' aggressively ' and releases chemicals that stunt growth , which hindered the chilli plants development ' interestingly , this was true even when all known signals from the basil were blocked , indicating that the facilitative interaction observed between these two species is mediated through a signalling modality other than those studied thus far			1
' most importantly , the fact that germination of chilli seeds did not differ between the masked and open treatment indicates that light , touch or chemical signals may be important but clearly not necessary for chilli seeds and basil plants to sense each other 's presence			1
' they added : ' the observed differences in germination between treatments were relatively small but even small differences in germination are likely to have significant effects on competitiveness and thus on fitness			0
' previous research by dr @entity14 showed that , even when protected against fennel 's chemical chilli seeds are reluctant to germinate when placed near the plant			0
the new findings have been published in the online journal @entity161 .			0

@entity164 scientists have found that plants talk to each other using microscopic sounds
how well crops grow can depend on which other plants are nearby
@entity108 is ' aggressive ' , while basil acts as a natural *pesticide*
