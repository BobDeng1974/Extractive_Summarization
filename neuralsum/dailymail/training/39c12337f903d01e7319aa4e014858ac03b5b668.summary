the @entity0 risks accusations of political correctness after saying that foreigners sneaking into @entity4 should not be referred to as illegal immigrants			1
the department said those trying to get into @entity4 unlawfully should be referred to as ' clandestine entrants '			2
the debate about the correct term to use was ignited after @entity12 , the independent immigration watchdog , described them as ' irregular migrants '			1
the number , which has almost quadrupled in just three years , does not take into account those who made it into @entity4 undetected			1
from april to july this year , 11,920 attempts were made to enter the @entity4			1
each day , almost 100 illegal immigrants try to enter @entity4 , the statistics released following a freedom of information request sent by @entity30 newspaper reveal			1
if current rates continue , by the end of the year , there could have been more than 35,000 attempts by immigrants to sneak into @entity4			2
that would be a huge increase on previous years			0
in the year april 2013 to april 2014 , 19,000 attempts were made , in 2012/13 it was 11,731 , and in 2011 - 12 the figure was 9,632			2
mr @entity12 appeared on @entity41 's today to discuss how the number of illegals attempting to reach @entity4 had soared in 2014 and described them as ' irregular migrants '			1
referring to inspection reports on the immigration system , the chief inspector of @entity45 and @entity46 said : ' we found that people found in lorries were being released to the @entity53 authorities but no record was being kept of who they were			0
' and of course these people when they try again and very often succeed in getting into the @entity4 as irregular migrants , the authorities in @entity4 have no record of who they are			1
' the @entity0 later said that the preferred term for ' illegal immigrants ' was ' clandestine entrants '			0
a spokesman said : ' if you say ' illegal immigrants ' there is a presumption and connotations that they have done something wrong			0
there are other reasons people come to this country by illegal methods , for instance because they are trafficked or organised crime groups			0
' on wednesday , mr @entity12 , the chief inspector of borders and immigration said in his final report that the @entity0 was still failing to ' get the basics right ' on immigration			1
the report added that it was ' frustrating and disappointing ' to encounter the same problems ' over and over again ' , he added			0
attempts : almost 100 immigrants have been trying to enter @entity4 illegally every day , statistics reveal @entity87 of @entity88 , chairman of @entity90 , warned that the rise was likely be caused by increased pressure on @entity4 's borders			1
he told @entity30 : ' the sharp rise in the number of clandestines might reflect more effective detection , but an increase on this scale is more likely to be due to increased pressure on our borders			0
' part of that may be due to deteriorating conditions in the @entity105 and @entity106 , but there is little doubt that the freedom of our society , the existence of a black market in labour and the presence of relatives and friends add up to making the @entity4 a very attractive destination			0
' the government is seeking to make it more difficult to live in @entity4 illegally but it will take some time for recent measures to take effect			0
' around 2,500 migrants are camped in @entity124 , @entity125 , wanting to try to travel to the @entity4			1
the government has already earmarked £ 12m to improve security and has urged lorry drivers and tourists to take extra precautions to stop would - be migrants boarding their vehicles			1
immigration and security minister @entity133 said : ' we continue to strengthen the security of our borders to stop those who have no right to enter the @entity4			1
we have made significant investment in ports in @entity125 to improve security and infrastructure			0
' using some of the best technology in the world , our officers prevented more than 18,000 attempts to cross the @entity148 illegally in the year to april 2014 - a rise of more than 60 per cent on the previous year			2
' we have also committed £ 12 million to further bolstering security at @entity124 and driven down the cost of back - office functions , allowing us to invest more in front - line operations			2
' @entity154 , shadow immigration minister , said : ' the government has ignored repeated warnings from @entity157 and hauliers about the growing crisis at @entity124			2
' @entity160 needs to realise how serious this problem is and take urgent steps to work with our allies in @entity164 to sort it out			0
under this government , illegal immigration is getting worse			0
that 's why @entity157 has put forward funded plans for 1,000 more border staff to help sort the problems out			0
' it is unacceptable that the same people are trying night after night to enter @entity4 illegally			1
if they do not have the right to remain in @entity164 , why are the @entity53 authorities taking no steps to remove them ? '			0
