@entity0 will this week come under mounting pressure to make sure families forced to miss their holidays because of the government 's passport crisis get their money back			1
@entity8 immigration minister @entity7 said ministers urgently needed to look into compensation schemes for those who could n't go abroad as a result of lengthy delays in processing their passports and vowed to press the government on the issue in @entity17 tomorrow			2
he said he would be tabling parliamentary questions about what the @entity19 is doing to discuss the situation with insurance companies for those with travel policies			1
@entity0 , pictured here at the @entity26 ceremony in @entity27 yesterday , will this week come under mounting pressure to ensure families that have missed their summer holidays get their money back passport applications awaiting to be processed at an office in @entity33 due to a massive backlog he told the @entity37 programme on @entity38 : ' i want to explore this week - and i will be tabling parliamentary questions tomorrow - what the government are doing to discuss with insurance companies for people who have taken out travel insurance			1
but it is a real issue			0
' the @entity47 , which deals with disputes between the public and finance firms , has said it may ask an insurer to pay the claim for a cancelled holiday as long as the policyholder had ' done all they reasonably could to chase the passport application ' and had ' put in their passport application in far in advance of the deadlines laid down by the passport office '			2
in a statement last week it said : ' if they ( the holidaymaker ) were still unable to travel due to the delays , then we would be looking for the insurer to act in the spirit of the insurance policy			2
' the development came after the home secretary @entity70 announced a raft of measures on thursday designed to clear the application backlog			2
she said passport applications would be fast - tracked for free for those who need to travel abroad urgently			1
in an emergency commons statement , mrs may insisted the @entity41 was doing all it could to deal with the backlog of more than 30,000 applications which had not been dealt with within the normal three - week deadline			2
but there are growing fears that mrs may 's decision to draft in emergency staff to clear the backlog could leave the passport service open to risk			1
it emerged today that 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘ suspect ’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the @entity95			1
these documents could be issued within the next fortnight , sources within @entity95 ( @entity95 ) claim , despite home secretary @entity70 ’s vow that security would not be compromised			2
the security loophole has been exposed after staff in the @entity95 ’s ‘ @entity103 ’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere			1
@entity8 immigration minister has called on the government to make sure that families who missed their holidays through no fault of their own are properly reimbursed these highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications			1
the problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the @entity103			2
a source told @entity126 : ‘ all hands are being called to the pumps and the @entity103 is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties			0
‘ the @entity103 estimates that within the next couple of weeks , because of this panic , there will be at least 1,000 “ unsecure ” passports issued to “ suspect ” persons			0
’ last week , @entity70 confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from @entity139 consulates abroad to an online system based in the @entity139 monitored by @entity95			1
she said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘ consistency ’ of service			0
she stressed that security would not be compromised			0
but the @entity95 source added : ‘ at one of the major @entity95 hubs , in @entity150 , they ’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world , which have to be checked , double - checked and triple - checked			1
the @entity103 handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny			0
‘ there is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which @entity95 staff have been trained to recognise			1
‘ but the government is drafting in inexperienced @entity163 staff to help			0
the problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full - time staff			0
’ the @entity103 was set up after it was discovered ‘ bulk ’ applications mainly by @entity171 gangsters were being made for @entity139 passports and a small number had been processed			0
home secretary @entity70 has vowed that security will not be comprised while the passport application backlog is tackled as the @entity150 team picked up on the problem , it was decided to base the unit there			2
last week , leaked documents from the @entity95 revealed a plan to ‘ relax ’ checks on applications from overseas			1
the @entity185 said it had been ‘ unaware ’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn			0
an @entity95 spokesman said : ‘ security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed			1
’ meanwhile , civil servants at @entity95 received bonuses worth more than £ 1.8 million last year , @entity126 can reveal			0
the bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘ good performance ’ at the service , which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications			1
more than 94 per cent received the ‘ in - year ’ bonus , supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘ key business targets ’			0
@entity203 , the former chief executive , received a bonus worth between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000 in 2012/13			0
on tuesday the current chief executive , @entity205 , will go before the @entity206 to face questioning over the crisis			0
@entity209 , the chairman of the committee , told @entity126 : ‘ it is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence			0
