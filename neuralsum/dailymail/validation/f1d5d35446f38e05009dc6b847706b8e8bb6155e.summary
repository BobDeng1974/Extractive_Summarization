a blunder from @entity2 keeper @entity1 ensured that the @entity4 promotion clash against @entity5 at @entity6 finished in a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity9 's 18th goal of the season gave the @entity2 a deserved lead at the break and the hosts were controlling the game when disaster struck in the 66th minute			1
@entity1 had had little to do all afternoon but when required to catch an in swinging corner from debutant @entity17 he somehow fumbled the ball into his own net to gift the defensive - minded @entity21 a point			2
@entity2 's goalkeeper @entity1 reacts after fumbling the ball to concede an equalising goal @entity2 players stand dejected as @entity5 's players celebrate their fortunate equalising goal the clash between second - placed @entity5 and fifth - placed @entity2 got off to a cagey start , with @entity31 's off - target shot from long range for the home side the only effort of note in the opening stages			1
@entity2 were very much on the front foot though and @entity38 and @entity39 also tried their luck from distance with no success against a @entity5 side who looked as though they had come for a point			0
on - loan midfielder @entity46 then had a clear sight of goal , only for a poor first touch to allow @entity50 to clear for a corner , before @entity9 steered the ball just wide after being put in by @entity53			0
@entity2 's @entity9 scores his sides first goal of the game at @entity6 on saturday without their main men up front - @entity57 and @entity58 - the @entity21 barely posed a threat at the other end and it was no surprise when @entity9 opened the scoring for the hosts on 31 minutes			1
a slick one - touch move instigated by @entity38 ended with @entity66 crossing low for @entity2 's top scorer to slot home from close range			0
@entity5 's appeals for offside were waved away and @entity2 continued to dominate , although @entity50 's quick dart into the box did provide a rare moment of alarm for the home side			0
@entity2 maintained their grip on the game in the early part of the second period , with @entity9 heading over from a corner before @entity83 's parry from a @entity85 snap - shot prompted a scramble in the visitors ' box			1
@entity2 's @entity89 ( right ) and @entity5 's @entity90 compete for the ball during the draw @entity17 and @entity53 compete for the ball as both side look for the winner at @entity6 @entity5 's lack of a specialist front man was painfully obvious although @entity99 's low shot on the hour mark did draw a save out of @entity1			1
but the @entity2 keeper then made a horrible mistake to hand the @entity21 an equaliser they scarcely deserved			2
@entity17 's 66th - minute corner from the right should have been a routine gather for the former @entity108 keeper but he took his eye off the ball and somehow fumbled it into the back of the net			0
@entity2 responded well to the shock and it required a brilliant one - handed save from @entity83 to keep out @entity115 's header from an in swinging @entity53 free - kick			0
@entity83 then denied substitute @entity89 as @entity2 looked for a grandstand finish before @entity9 wastefully headed a @entity85 cross just over and @entity31 then followed suit with his left foot .			2

@entity9 's 18th goal of the season gave the @entity2 the lead
a blunder from @entity2 keeper @entity1 meant they were *pegged* back
in the end both sides had to *settle* for a share of the spoils at @entity6
just one point separates both sides in the @entity4 after the draw
