@entity7 , 39 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , explained on today 's @entity10 he has ' learnt to live ' with his condition but it has caused endless problems with his love life			1
while he said he has never had any trouble getting girlfriends , he said some have been more understanding about his situation than others			2
' it is difficult to explain to a new girlfriend but when i have some have been really nice about it , ' he said			2
' but i was punched in the face once when i told a girl			2
i guess she was angry as she felt like i had lied but it 's not something you can say right away			2
' mr @entity7 has hit headlines before because of his rare affliction			1
he explained how he was born with an ectopic bladder , meaning it formed on the outside of his body			1
doctors were able to fix his bladder so he was able to pass urine but he never developed a penis			1
angered one girlfriend : he explained to presenters @entity52 and @entity54 how he was once punched in the face when a date discovered the truth about his body presenters @entity54 and @entity52 asked him how he had coped as a school boy			1
he said : ' as child it was easy , guys do n't look at each others private bits			2
i did get bullied a little as i was always in and out of hospital , people did n't know why i needed treatment but had an idea of area it was in			0
' he explained how as he grew up it became ' second nature ' to hide his problem and when he first began to develop sexual feeling towards women it was n't a problem thanks to having a sympathetic first love			0
he said : ' my first girlfriend was really nice and understanding			0
we went out for four years and it was not a problem			0
it may had been if we were together in the future but we were only 15 so it was n't			0
' hope : mr @entity7 is happy with new girlfriend , @entity89 , right , and positive about surgery where a penis will be created from the skin on his arm despite his problem , mr @entity7 said he continued to have numerous girlfriends and his reluctance to jump into bed on the first date sometimes worked in his favour - as women were often delighted to be with a ' nice guy ' who wanted to take the relationship slowly			1
however , he also said he went through ' dark times ' when he took drugs to forget about ' who he was '			0
but this only led to him becoming more depressed and he was once so low he made a suicide attempt			0
but with the help of family , friends , and a new supportive girlfriend , @entity89 , he in now back on track			0
he admitted he is finally feeling ' positive ' about the future as he is set to have a groundbreaking operation where a penis will be created from the skin in his arm			1
this will then be ' wired up ' to be fully functional			0
there is a possibility he will one day be able to have children but he said he is yet to fully discuss this with surgeons at @entity124 who have agreed to carry out the complicated three - part operation			1
' i 've learnt to live with one but i owe it to myself to give it a go , ' he said .			0
