when @entity1 and @entity2 meet at @entity3 on sunday , there will not be a single local lad starting in this iconic fixture for the first time in the @entity8 era			1
april 26 1992 , the final time the two sides met in the old @entity11 , was the last time no player in @entity1 's starting @entity13 was born within 30 miles of @entity3 or a @entity2 player within the same distance from @entity16			1
in the 53 league and cup meetings since , the likes of @entity18 - likely to start from the bench on sunday - @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 have starred for @entity1 , while @entity2 's local lads have included @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity18 looks dejected in defeat after @entity1 were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity2 last december local lad @entity32 also started that game for @entity2 @entity34 - born @entity28 tackled by @entity18 at @entity3 last season @entity20 ( left ) and @entity36 during a game at @entity16 in march 2010 @entity38 , a designated @entity39 , does n't count ( although he was born less than four miles from @entity3 ) , while @entity40 is also excluded as he was born in @entity41			1
back in april 1992 , when @entity1 won 2 - 0 at home , there were 11 @entity45 players on the pitch , but none born within 30 miles of either stadium			2
in fact , the closest on that day was @entity50 , born 31 miles from @entity3 - but in @entity41			0
while @entity52 lad @entity51 , born 29 miles from @entity16 , came off the bench that day for @entity2			0
@entity1 's @entity22 is sent tumbling by @entity2 's @entity27 in march 2001 @entity1 players @entity56 ( left ) , @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity21 celebrate after beating @entity57 in the @entity58 in january 1998 @entity40 of @entity2 goes past @entity1 's @entity59 in january 2011 in the most recent encounter between the two sides , a 3 - 0 home win for @entity2 in december , both clubs featured a local lad from the start			0
@entity18 began the game for @entity1 , while @entity32 , born in @entity67 27.5 miles away from @entity16 , was selected by @entity68			2
like @entity18 , there is also a possibility that @entity32 and @entity71 - also born in @entity34 - could feature on sunday			2
@entity72 , meanwhile , will return at some stage from injury to boost the @entity76 ' scouse contingent			0
but with the departure of @entity28 from @entity2 last summer , and @entity18 leaving @entity1 at the end of the season , the chances are that the trend of no local lads starting the biggest game in @entity45 football will continue for a little while longer .			0

@entity18 is set to start on the bench for @entity1 on sunday
it means no local player ( born within 30 miles of their stadium ) will start for either side in this game for the first time in *23* years
@entity2 travel to face @entity1 in the @entity8
@entity32 and @entity71 could be on the bench for @entity2
