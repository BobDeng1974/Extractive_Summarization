a @entity1 construction expert has just finished making the first 3d - printed castle			2
@entity3 put up the building — complete with turrets and a spire — in his garden in @entity8			1
although it is just big enough for someone to stand in , the castle is a watershed moment for the technology			0
captivated by 3d printers , mr @entity3 , who has a background in engineering and design , created his own			1
he printed out a mixture of cement and sand using technology and software from the open - source @entity40 printing project			0
the structure is large enough for adults to walk into , and the darker area of the castle , which measures 50cm in height , was constructed in eight hours using his 3d printer @entity3 's castle was printed completely outside in his garden , where the cement sets quickly in the warm summer temperatures of 35 degrees @entity24			1

he said : ' i still have some imperfections , mostly when i stop the printer , but if i print nonstop , the layers look great			0
' ' though i 'm not completely finished with this structure yet , from the current progress , i can already see that i am ready for the next step , which is printing a house with this technology			0
