published : 09:30 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 10:48 est , 27 january 2014 @entity2 councillor @entity1 has quit the group in @entity4 in protest at the party 's handling of the @entity9 allegations a senior @entity2 councillor has quit the party group over its handling of allegations against mp @entity15			1
@entity1 resigned from the @entity2 group on @entity17 , accusing her party of turning the scandal into a ' game show '			1
it comes as the party effectively deselected mr @entity15 , announcing it was looking for a candidate to stand in the 2015 election			1
@entity26 ’s leadership faced a fresh crisis last week after revelations that mr @entity15 sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent			1
mr @entity26 said the first he knew about the crisis was when he saw a report by an independent @entity31 into the claims			1
the party only suspended mr @entity15 last week , three years after allegations against him first surfaced			1
mr @entity15 , who denies any wrongdoing , resigned the party whip in parliament last year , but was still sitting as a @entity2 local councillor			1
after a @entity41 police investigation concluded there was no case to answer , @entity17 launched an inquiry into whether mr @entity15 had breached the council 's code of conduct , but that has now been put on hold pending the outcome of the civil court action			1
the report , carried out by @entity53 for the council , found ‘ compelling ’ evidence of ‘ serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour ’ towards a vulnerable woman constituent			0
she suffered a mental health disorder and had been sexually abused as a child			0
now @entity61 , who has represented @entity62 - the same ward as mr @entity15 - since 2002 , has resigned from the @entity2 group on the council in protest			2
she told the @entity67 : ‘ i remain a @entity2 member , and committed to being a councillor and @entity4			0
‘ i hope that others involved in the @entity72 ’s decision on friday will reflect on their positions , and do the right thing			0
we need to run a city , not a game show			0
' @entity61 added : ‘ i have previously raised concerns with @entity2 headquarters in @entity80 , and i trust that they will concede that they need to give me , and others here , support to clean out the @entity84			2
’ @entity2 mp @entity15 , pictured leaving his home in @entity87 , @entity41 , is accused of making unwanted advances towards a constituent other @entity2 in @entity4 have continued to voice support for mr @entity15 , accusing the party leadership of suspending him without due process			1
on friday mr @entity26 insisted he had taken firm action against mr @entity9 : ‘ when i was given the specific allegations at the beginning of last year i immediately asked our chief whip to investigate			2
as a result @entity15 ceased to be a @entity2 mp			1
‘ when those allegations were then supported by the @entity31 's report that has come to light this week again we acted immediately and @entity15 has been suspended from the @entity2 altogether			1
’ however , today it emerged that the woman who has made claims against mr @entity15 wrote to mr @entity26 in march 2011 , saying : ' he can not be trusted and he is a liability to women , public and also your party			1
stop the behaviour from him and his staff and whoever is involved with mr @entity15 as this is holy wrong			2
and please reply to this letter as it is very important to me that i get answers from you			0
' a leaked tape recording shows number 10 staff confirming the letter had been released and it would be passed on to mr @entity26 's political office			1
now the party has moved to effectively de-select mr @entity15			1
the local @entity2 group has announced they are in the process of selecting a candidate for the next general election			0
@entity128 , chairman of @entity129 , has said that although the local party believed mr @entity15 had the right to respond to the allegations against him , they were still considering his future			1
he said : ' the executive has clearly reconfirmed its belief in natural justice and the right of @entity15 to fully respond in due course to the allegations made against him			2
we reiterate our belief that it is for the court to reach its conclusions based on all the evidence			0
' the executive is continuing the process of selecting parliamentary candidates for @entity149 and @entity150 constituencies to stand at the general election in may 2015 and will be continuing our efforts to contest all wards in the city in the upcoming elections in may 2014			0
' but mr @entity15 insisted he would not be forced out by the party			2
he told @entity4 newspaper @entity157 : ' i 'll make the decision whether i stand as an mp or not when i decide , not when people are trying to make a decision when they know it will be impossible for me to be involved in it			0
' i do n't think that it 's a very fair thing to do			0
i 'd have thought they at least owed me that to wait for the civil case			0
' meanwhile mr @entity26 continues to face questions about his handling of allegations against @entity170 , the former chief executive who denies inappropriate behaviour towards female activists			1
fear : friends of the embattled @entity170 have warned he could expose @entity2 sex scandals if he is expelled from the party friends of the embattled peer have warned he could expose @entity2 sex scandals if he is expelled from the party			1
@entity170 - who has denied allegations of sexual harassment - could go ‘ nuclear ’ if party leader @entity26 stops him from re-joining the party			1
@entity170 became active with the @entity2 as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party			2
now friends feel he has been treated ‘ cruelly ’ and could retaliate if he is shut out permanently			1
he could reveal secrets , such as claims like that of a former mp who was known to be a persistent sex pest , the liaison between a @entity2 peer and married mp , and details of gay affairs between peers and @entity197 , according to the @entity198			2
a spokesman for @entity170 declined to comment last night			2
the @entity2 peer has kept silent in the last few days , as have the women who made allegations against him			0
according to one source , he has a ‘ little black book ’ filled with many politician and activists ’ darkest secrets			0
the @entity2 , who did not wish to be named , said that most of in the party ‘ lived in fear ’ of the @entity211 - like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him			0
the source said : ‘ he is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off - loaded their skeletons on to him			0
but he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book			0
it ’s no wonder that it ’s taken ten years for anyone to confront him			0
’ crisis management : @entity170 was also at the centre of managing other @entity2 crises such as the discovery that @entity227 ( left ) had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of @entity230 ( right ) @entity170 was also at the centre of managing other @entity2 crises such as the discovery that former mp @entity227 had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of @entity230 when he was party leader			1
he was also chief executive at the time that former party leader @entity235 resigned after his drinking habit was exposed			0
another @entity2 source revealed : ‘ he is the mastermind of many of the dirty tricks campaigns during elections that we have , rightly or wrongly , become known for			0
loyal : @entity170 became active with the @entity2 as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party he once suggested printing a photograph of an opponent ’s house on a leaflet to point out that he did not live in the constituency			2
’ but sources close to party leader @entity26 have called it a ‘ grubby threat ’ and warned that ‘ it is this sort of thing that got us into this mess in the first place ... it ’s time to move past it			2
’ an independent mediator is being appointed by the @entity2 to try and broker a truce between both sides .			0

@entity1 takes swipe at party over claims against mp @entity15
she urges @entity26 to clear the party 's ' @entity84 ' of scandal
friends of peer @entity170 say he could go ' nuclear ' if he *kicked* out
they feel @entity170 has been treated ' cruelly ' and could retaliate
