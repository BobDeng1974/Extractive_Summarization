by @entity1 reporter at first sight it looks like nothing more than a fallen leaf , brittle and brown with a few insect bites taken out			1
but closer inspection reveals that the piece of foliage is in fact a cunningly camouflaged insect which has managed to blend in with its jungle surroundings			2
seconds after its hiding place was disturbed , the animal - a sort of grasshopper known as the leaf katydid - spreads its wings to reveal vibrant autumnal patterns on the inside			1
disguise : the insect , which was found hanging on a tree in the @entity28 country of @entity29 , is able to camouflage itself by mimicking a leag uncovered : the insect , which was disguising itself against a leaf , revealed its more vibrant wings when disturbed the insect was found blended into its surroundings in the @entity35 region of @entity36 , a @entity28 country north of @entity38			1
it was noticed by @entity28 photographer @entity39 , who took the pictures after making the lucky find as he travelled across the continent			2
he said : ' if you ever visit a humid , tropical area in @entity28 or @entity45 you may be rewarded with the discovery of one of the most amazing animals - the leaf katydid			1
' the only way to notice them is to look for the movement of their long antennae and legs as they slowly munch on leaves at night			0
' mr @entity39 added : ' these katydids are probably the best mimics of plants among all insects			2
' look for the antennae ' : the leaf kaydid ' their mimicry is by no means restricted to resemblance of plain , green leaves - that would be too easy			0
' when the insects fall to the ground , they often play dead when approached by a predator			0
' ' their bodies are replicas of leaves that have been chewed up , torn , rotten , dried up , partially decayed , or covered by fungi			0
but the best part is that no two individuals are alike			0
