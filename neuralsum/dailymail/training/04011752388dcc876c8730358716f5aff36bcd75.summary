@entity0 is reluctant to step in as a last - minute host for next year 's @entity2 after it emerged that @entity4 wants to postpone or move the tournament because of fears over the spread of the @entity9 epidemic			1
the @entity0 sport ministry is also wary of the ebola virus and cited unplanned staging costs as a reason for not wanting to host the tournament , which is scheduled to start on january 17			1
' there are just too many factors to consider for @entity0 , ' the country 's department of sport and recreation said in a statement on friday			2
@entity0 hosted the @entity21 but is reluctant to step in as hosts for the @entity23 the @entity24 wrote to the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) to outline its concern that hundreds of thousands of fans travelling into the country from @entity9 - affected areas could exacerbate the spread of the disease , which has killed more than 4,000 people across @entity33			1
although @entity4 has not officially refused to host the finals , the country 's authorities have made the case to @entity25 that the @entity9 outbreak in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 warrants either postponing the tournament or moving it to another country			1
it is unlikely that any of those three countries will qualify for the tournament			0
in response to @entity4 's concerns , @entity25 have reportedly approached seven nations including @entity49 and @entity0 about hosting the tournament , which is scheduled to start on january 17			1
the @entity2 is under threat due to host nation @entity4 's fears about the ebola virus the @entity0 sports ministry stressed it had not yet been officially asked by the @entity54 to consider hosting the tournament , but it moved quickly to rule itself out of the running			1
a statement said the cost of an unplanned hosting in just three months was its ' major concern , ' but @entity9 was a factor			2
' the tournament ... may also pose a challenge on how we can grapple with the @entity9 challenge engulfing the continent at the moment			0
' the @entity0 sport ministry is wary of the @entity9 outbreak and the cost of hosting the competition @entity54 president @entity69 added : ' we must all take care of this pandemic and put strict measures in place			2
' @entity75 is another of the nations being touted as a possible replacement and a decision will be made when @entity25 's executive committee meets on november 2			1
the alternative option to finding a replacement host is postponing the competition , but that would cause havoc with the football calendar , which is jam - packed as it is			0
@entity49 ( wearing red ) , in action last week against @entity40 , have also been approached to host the tournament @entity49 midfielder @entity89 denied rumours this week that he had contracted the ebola virus in the event of @entity25 forcing @entity4 to host the event and the country refusing , the governing body could ban the @entity96 from the organisation 's competitions			1
@entity99 , @entity4 's sports minister , insisted the country 's concerns were entirely sensible given the threat posed by the ebola virus , and he stressed that his country was simply following the advice of the @entity106 ( @entity106 )			2
' our concern is the health of @entity0 , and based on @entity106 reports and guidelines , we have to listen , ' @entity99 was quoted as saying in the @entity112			0
@entity114 manager @entity113 is testing @entity115 for @entity9 after he played in @entity0 this week ' zero safety does not exist , but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast , bringing together our @entity0 brothers			1
but given the current @entity9 situation , we do n't think such a feast can take place as expected			0
' we are talking about the @entity2 where we are expecting between 200,000 and 400,000 , even one million , spectators to converge in @entity4			0
i do n't think there is any state or any country that has the necessary capabilities to monitor , check and control the current @entity9 situation when faced with these numbers			2
this is our real problem			0
we do n't have a problem with visiting teams , we have a problem with visitors			0
' precautions are also being taken in @entity138 , with @entity114 manager @entity113 confirming that that they have become the first @entity141 club to screen @entity0 players returning from international duty for the virus			1
@entity145 ( r ) is another player returning from @entity0 who will be monitored by @entity114 's medical staff @entity113 , when asked about @entity145 , the @entity148 striker , and @entity115 , the @entity149 midfielder - who have played in @entity150 and the @entity151 respectively this week , as well as their own countries - stated that the @entity154 would be ' naive not to have concerns ' about the virus and advised other teams to take similar measures			1
' we have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of , ' he said			0
' they 're essential to us and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise and also protection for them , and making sure we do our very best to help them			0
it 's something to be concerned about and we have to be on our guard			0
