waves as tall as skyscrapers move deep within the ocean , but despite their vast size , marine scientists are unsure what happens when the waves crash into land			1
now , 40 researchers aboard ships in the @entity10 are trying to unlock the mystery of the 1,000ft ( 305 metre ) waves , by measuring how they travel , how their energy is dissipated and the benefits they may bring			1
the waves are thought to be important to the oceans ' health and understanding exactly how they ' die ' could lead to more accurate climate modelling			2
@entity36 , professor of oceanography at @entity38 in @entity39 , told @entity40 : ‘ the wavelength between crests is about 100 miles , and they ’re moving at jogging speed			0
’ internal tides form when the surface tides visible on coastlines wash water back and forth across undersea mountains			0
they can be created at any depth			0
the forces created by that movement spawn underwater waves that can travel great distances in the interior of the sea , but no - one is sure what happens to their energy when they hit land			1
some 40 researchers aboard ships in the @entity10 are studying the waves ( the @entity65 is shown )			2
they will deploy autonomous ‘ deep - diving gliders ’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings , which are anchored cables equipped with dozens of temperature sensors and other devices to provide data on the internal tides @entity72 , @entity73 , likened the east coast of @entity75 - where the reserach is taking place ( shown on the map ) to a natural laboratory for the study of deep tidal mixing what : an international ocean study to track the massive internal waves of the @entity10			1
the project , called the @entity86 ( t - tide ) will take 10 weeks			0
where : the ships – the @entity65 and @entity90 - have departed from @entity91 , @entity75			0
why : findings about how the waves dissipate will lead to improvements in global climate models and an understanding of how marine nutrients circulate			1
action : scientists will deploy autonomous ‘ deep - diving gliders ’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings			2
they will use instruments on the ships to search for turbulent internal waves at depths of up to two miles ( 3km ) that are predicted to collide with the @entity75 continental slope , and collect data about them			1
the waves are responsible for stirring up marine nutrients and carrying them to the surface , providing food for everything from plankton to whales			0
scientists believe that areas of the ocean with active internal waves , such as the @entity10 , are among the healthiest locations			1
marine biologists are focusing their research efforts on the sea , which is where the largest internal waves on the planet are formed			1
@entity72 , @entity73 of the @entity127 , likened the east coast of @entity75 to a natural laboratory for the study of deep tidal mixing			0
@entity75 stands in the path of a ‘ beam ’ of internal tidal waves that are generated on an underwater mountain chain - the @entity136 - south of @entity137			2
skyscraper - sized waves formed there , take around one week to travel 1,500 miles ( 2,414km ) to the southeast coast of @entity75 , before breaking on the continental shelf – the ' ramp ' of rock before the shore			1
computer models and satellite observations confirm that four waves slam into the east coast of @entity75 daily			0
but scientists are not sure how the energy of the enormous waves dissipates			2
internal waves are thought to be important to the ocean ’s health and understanding how their energy dissipates could lead to more accurate climate modelling as well as building the clearest picture yet of the vast waves			1
waves rebounding on a coastline are pictured the @entity38 says in a post : ‘ what happens next is n’t so clear , since the wave - breaking and turbulence that results from this impact will happen far below the often stormy sea surface			2
’ the researchers say the knowledge they gain on their trip will boost the accuracy of climate modelling			2
in order to study the waves , they will deploy autonomous ‘ deep - diving gliders ’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings , which are anchored cables equipped with dozens of temperature sensors and other devices to provide data on the internal tides			1
scientists will use instruments on the ships to search for turbulent internal waves at depths of up to two miles ( 3km ) that are predicted to collide with the @entity75 continental slope - and collect data about them			1
@entity38 oceanographer @entity189 said : ‘ the goal of scientists is to discover and measure the procession of those internal tidal waves and to document the various phenomena that occur when they impact the deep continental slopes			2
’ ‘ it is conjectured that the turbulent mixing that occurs in the deep sea off @entity75 and other “ special ” sites is sufficient to affect the overall circulation of the global ocean			0
understanding these processes is thus a critical step in predicting our climate			0
’ internal waves are responsible for stirring up marine nutrients and carrying them to the surface , providing food for everything from plankton to whales ( a stock image of a humpback feeding is shown ) commenting on the study , dr @entity216 , a physical oceanography lecturer at the @entity218 ( @entity218 ) told @entity220 : ‘ the importance of this research lies in understanding how different waters of the ocean are mixed together			1
‘ the global circulation of the ocean features cooling of surface water in the @entity229 and around @entity230			0
‘ this cold water sinks to the bottom of the ocean and travels towards the equator			0
near the surface , warm water moves towards the poles to replace the water that has sunk - the @entity234 is one of these warm surface currents			0
‘ a question that remains is how the cold water near the bottom is returned to the surface to complete the circulation			0
‘ mixing of the deep ocean water is required to do this and breaking of internal waves on continental slopes is one way this mixing can occur			1
the internal waves are generated either by the tide or by storms over the ocean			1
‘ the global circulation of the ocean is important as it - along with the circulation of the atmosphere - transports heat from the warm tropics to the cool poles			0
this is one climate connection .			0

internal waves - deep in the @entity10 - can be 1,000ft ( 305metres ) tall
*experts* do *n't* know what happens to waves ' energy when they hit land
waves can travel distanced of over 1,500 miles ( 2,414km )
marine biologists are dropping sensors into the sea to study the waves
internal waves are important to the ocean *'s* health and could boost the accuracy of climate models , according to marine scientists
