former @entity1 trainee @entity0 was part of the @entity4 side which triumphed at @entity5			1
he left the club as a 17 - year - old following a serious breach of discipline			1
five years on and @entity0 has rebuilt his career and is now one of the stars of @entity14 's side , playing a key role during their shock 4 - 2 victory in saturday 's @entity18 fourth round tie			1
here , the @entity21 - born midfielder reflects on his weekend with @entity22			1
@entity0 ( bottom ) celebrates with team - mate @entity24 after beating @entity1 in the @entity18 ' no - one felt any pressure really and we went there to enjoy the day - that was always the message			1
' but at the same time we had a game - plan and intended to stick to it			2
even at 2 - 0 down i thought we were playing well			1
' at that point i was actually still really enjoying the game because i thought we were doing okay , we certainly were n't falling to pieces			0
' when we got to 2 - 1 before half - time it was huge though			1
we came out for the second half full of belief and when we equalised it was just incredible , although it was deserved			0
' i went off at 2 - 2 but it was always going to be the way that the substitutes played a massive part , and they won us the game			1
@entity0 ( centre ) tussles for the ball with @entity1 defender @entity49 at @entity5 @entity0 and his dad show off his signed shirt from @entity1 captain @entity52 following @entity4 's 4 - 2 win ' i was kicking every ball after that			1
i mean , winning at @entity1 just does n't happen			2
what we achieved is unbelievable			0
but i honestly think we deserved to win			0
' at the same time , they were excellent			0
the way they move the ball makes it so hard			0
you do n't tackle , you just end up trying to block passes or cut off the space , they are so good			0
' when @entity66 came on i was a bit star - struck , he 's one of my idols			1
' to win against that side – with so many world - class players – is probably the biggest achievement of our careers			2
' it 's amazing for the lads , the gaffer , the club and the fans			2
' @entity79 was brilliant afterwards			0
he came in the dressing - room and shook everyone 's hand			2
he told us to make sure we enjoy the day and wished us luck in the next round			2
it was really classy and the lads loved it			0
former @entity1 trainee @entity0 is sent crashing to the ground after a challenge from @entity92 ( left ) @entity0 admits he was star - struck when his ' idol ' @entity66 entered the action as a substitute ' we were singing and dancing and the chairman sent some champagne down – the scenes were incredible			1
' @entity52 gave me his signed shirt and my dad is going to frame that with my shirt and the programme and scarf and match ticket to put up in the house			0
' i went back to @entity21 on the bus with all my friends and family afterwards – that was some journey			0
my dad , @entity113 , had organised it and they had some day			0
' we went out on saturday night to our local pubs , the @entity118 and @entity119			0
i did n't have to buy a drink all night ! ' like @entity121 told us , we had a fair few beers and enjoyed it - my fiancée had to send me home to bed in the end ! @entity127 beats the @entity1 defence and slots home past @entity130 to make it 4 - 2 to @entity4 @entity4 's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after a stunning comeback in west @entity136 ' then on sunday it was mum , @entity138 , her 51st birthday so all the family went out again			1
she 's a @entity1 fan though so she 's the only one who has n't enjoyed it as much as everyone else , but my dad is a fully signed up @entity4 fan			1
' we just ca n't wait for the draw now			2
it was so special going back to @entity1			2
a lot has been made of me leaving there but that is in the past and saturday was amazing , the best day of my career			0
' now i want @entity151 in the next round , another one of my old clubs			1
' but look at the teams left in , a lot of big boys have gone , why ca n't we go all the way ? '			0
