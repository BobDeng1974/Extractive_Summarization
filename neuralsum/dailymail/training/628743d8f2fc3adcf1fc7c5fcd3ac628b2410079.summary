@entity0 and @entity1 have vowed to resist what they believe is the ' game plan ' for @entity4 over the years to come			1
this weekend 's @entity5 may represent the title decider between @entity8 duo @entity7 and @entity9 , but off track there is far more at stake			1
for the third successive race weekend , @entity4 supremo @entity13 is to sit down with the trio of smaller marques pleading for change within the sport			1
@entity0 and @entity1 will speak to @entity4 supremo @entity13 this week about their future in the sport @entity13 has already rejected out of hand their demands for a more equitable distribution of income , with the ' big four ' - @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity8 and @entity29 - claiming half of last year 's £ 530million revenues			1
@entity1 team principal @entity31 and @entity0 deputy team principal @entity32 have already suggested ' an agenda ' is being set whereby the smaller teams are to be driven out of the sport			1
@entity32 , however , insists his team are ready to dig their heels in and fight tooth and nail against the potential introduction of third cars , and eventually customer cars			0
' you 've got to interpret from the evidence that ( an agenda ) is a given , ' @entity32 said			0
' clearly it 's indicating in that direction			2
we know what the desired outcome is			0
it does n't necessarily mean getting rid of us - it could mean converting us to customer teams			2
mercedes are one of four teams to have claimed half of last year 's £ 530million in revenues made by @entity4 ' but one way or another it is probably trying not to keep the status quo			1
where we have the full constructors ' series , it is to break us up			0
' the clear direction we are getting is there is a desire to have five constructor teams and five customer teams , which will be the best way they feel to go			2
' but a resolute @entity32 added : ' from our point of view , we can now focus on strengthening our status as a constructor , and we will do			0
' now we know what the game plan is , and the last few weeks have exposed it , we can work with it			0
' we just want to make sure we stay a constructor , and we will work hard to do that and stay competitive			0
' what has happened certainly makes @entity82 ( @entity83 , co-owner ) very , very strong			0
' @entity1 have been racing in the sport since 1993 but could be forced out due to the financial spat @entity31 , whose team are poised to the end the season without a point to their name for the first time in their history , is also of the same firm mind as @entity32			1
' we have been in this sport since 1993 , ' she said			2
' @entity0 have been around a while , @entity97 as well			2
how can you just drive out people like this ? it 's just not right			0
' the big teams use @entity4 as a simple sporting , marketing platform			1
it 's nothing more for them			0
' they talk of it as being a sport , of fairness and all that stuff , but where is that now ? ' years ago we had a situation with another team that now is the world champion , and all the teams got together			2
' we are not out here with , as they are saying , a begging bowl , but we are part of the show			0
' it 's very disrespectful to behave this way towards other teams within the sport , and even more disrespectful towards the fans			1
' @entity97 is another of those teams who 's future is uncertain at the moment in @entity4			1

@entity5 is the season - finale that takes place on *sunday*
@entity4 teams @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity8 and @entity29 claimed half of last year 's £ 530million revenues made by the sport
@entity0 and @entity1 want a change in order to survive in the sport
