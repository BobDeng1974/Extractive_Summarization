chasing a lorry down the motorway and pulling open the back doors to clamber inside , this was the scene in @entity4 today as yet more immigrants make frantic attempts to get into the @entity7			1
@entity9 authorities say they have been forced to send an extra 100 police to the port city as an estimated 2,500 migrants sleep rough in camps in the hope of crossing the channel			1
the frightened people , mostly from @entity17 and @entity18 , have been drawn to @entity4 in the hope of reaching ' @entity21 ' @entity20 , thanks to generous state handouts , according to the town 's mayor			1
desperation : a group of migrants rip open the back doors of a lorry in @entity4 today as they try to find a way to cross from @entity9 into @entity20 in search of a better life wave of humanity : there are thought to be around 2,500 people currently camping in the @entity9 port city , as authorities send another 100 officers to deal with the crisis dying for a better life : yesterday the mayor of @entity4 warned that migrants were willing to die in order to get to @entity20 , and blamed generous government handouts for drawing them in @entity47 yesterday told the @entity48 home affairs select committee that the @entity7 's welfare system is to blame for the crisis , which has seen record numbers of migrants arrive this year			1
the offer of £ 35 per week for those arriving on these shores is prompting people to risk their lives to cross the channel			0
she said : ‘ the real magnet is not the city of @entity4 but the benefits that are perceived in @entity20			2
‘ the weekly benefits of £ 36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives			2
‘ they have no idea about the value of money … but they know from those people who have got through [ to @entity20 ] that … they can easily find work , do n’t have to declare their work , they can find accommodation and can get some money every week			0
fleeing : the men are mostly @entity17 or @entity18 and are fleeing humanitarian problems back home , including war , famine and persecution lost : yesterday it was revealed that the @entity7 government has lost track of 50,000 illegal migrant , while it has failed to deport another 175,000 under attack : just last month a @entity94 ferry crew were forced to use a fire hose on 250 immigrants as they tried to rush on board the boat ( pictured , a migrant tried to break into a lorry in @entity4 today ) ' people who have got through call and say , … " this is @entity21 and we ’re staying here "			1
’ once here , there is also the chance that they could become one of the 50,000 illegal immigrants that the @entity112 admits it has lost track of			0
it was revealed today that ministers have failed to kick out another 175,000 immigrants , at a time when applications to enter the country have grown by an alarming 70 per cent in a year			0
it is perhaps no surprise , then , to find thousands of desperate people living in squalid camps in @entity9 , and leaping into lorries in an attempt to come here			2
these images show groups of ten or more forcing open the back of lorries destined for @entity130 before virtually tripping over each - other in order to pile in			2
setting up camp : the @entity9 government has announced plans for a shelter for the migrants who are currently sleeping in tents , saying that the conditions have lead to infighting no other choice : while many fear that the new shelter will simply attract more desperate people , @entity9 says it is the @entity7 benefits system that has drawn so many in the first place taking shelter : a migrant hoping to find a way into @entity20 from @entity4 sits underneath a makeshift awning in one of the camps that now surround @entity4 the issue of immigration has shot up the political agenda in @entity20 ever since @entity155 become the first @entity157 mp after winning a by - election in @entity159 by a huge margin			1
a @entity162 survey revealed last week that @entity163 is on course to become @entity166 's second mp in a by - election in @entity168 next month , as voters punish both the @entity170 and @entity171 over immigration and the @entity173			0
@entity174 and @entity175 exchanged blows over the issue during prime minister 's questions in @entity180 today , with @entity181 attacking the prime minister - saying his government had missed key migration targets			0
@entity47 says @entity20 must own up to its part in causing the current crisis in @entity4 , and called on @entity175 to prove that the @entity7 is not an ' @entity21 ' for migrants @entity175 hit back , saying he would compared his record to @entity171 's ' any time ' , suggesting that the last government had created the mess he was trying to fix			1
only last month staff on a @entity94 ferry were forced to use a fire hose on around 250 @entity195 men after they scaled barriers around the port and tried to storm on to the boat			0
the lorry driver who filmed the scene described the city as being like a ' war zone ' , saying the problem was the worst he had seen it in 20 years .			0
