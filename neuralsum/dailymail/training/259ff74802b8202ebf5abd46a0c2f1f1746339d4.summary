by @entity0 the backlash against the @entity2 is growing as home - schooling and other parents increasingly demand the end of the controversial education standards			1
the @entity8 forces scored a victory last week when @entity11 governor @entity10 signed legislation to repeal the rules in her state			1
home - schooling mothers like @entity16 are often leading the charge , becoming a frequent presence at legislative hearings and other political @entity20 , president of @entity22 , helped organize rallies , robo calls and letters to legislators encouraging the repeal			1
we had to do it , ' @entity16 said			0
' we just had to do it out of a shoestring budget out of our own accounts			0
' @entity35 , pictured with her sons @entity38 , 9 , left , and @entity39 , 11 , pulled them out of their public elementary school in part of because of her opposition to the @entity2 math standards home - schooling parents can teach their kids what they choose , but many of these parents still have a big beef with the standards			1
@entity53 groups such as ' @entity54 ' have popped up			0
a @entity55 produced video on the standards has been viewed online hundreds of thousands of times			2
' all parents should be concerned about this			0
to me , it 's not political , ' said @entity35 of @entity67 , @entity68			0
she pulled two of her three sons out of their public elementary school , in part , because of the math standards , and she co-founded @entity75			2
the standards , adopted in more than 40 states and the @entity78 , spell out what math and @entity81 skills public school students should master at each grade			2
they were pushed by governors concerned that too few graduates were ready for life after high school			0
use of the standards has become a hot button issue in many states , and governors in @entity94 and @entity95 recently signed legislation repealing them			0
the issue has pitted @entity99 - aligned @entity98 with grassroots conservatives , including many home - schooling parents			1
the @entity2 effort was led by the states , but the @entity105 administration has offered incentives to those that adopted ' college and career ' ready standards			1
that has led to charges of federal intrusion			0
the concern that the more education policy is centralized , ' the less control they have as citizens ' motivates many of these home - schooling parents , said @entity121 , director of education at the conservative @entity122			1
some of these parents , like @entity35 , believe the standards are poorly designed			2
@entity35 said she believes the math standards are developmentally inappropriate for younger kids , not rigorous enough for older students and too heavy on pushing informational text over literature			0
other home - schoolers fear that as textbook publishers incorporate the standards , it will lead to a smaller number of @entity137 based - textbooks , said @entity16 , from @entity138 , @entity11			1
she says she teaches her children using ' classically ' aligned texts			0
@entity121 said there is a concern that the @entity143 and the @entity144 , which owns the sat , are moving toward aligning with the standards			0
that , he said , would leave home - schooling parents no choice other than to follow the standards if they want their kids to do well on the college entrance exams			1
an @entity143 official said the company supports the @entity2 standards , but the exam has n't changed because of them			1
the @entity144 , which is revamping the @entity145 , has said the new version of the exam is n't aligned to a single set of standards			0
@entity161 waits for his computer to boot at home in @entity67 , @entity68 , after his mother pulled him out of school because of the new math standards @entity167 of the @entity55 , based in @entity168 , @entity169 , said there is n't anything ' inherently objectionable ' in the @entity2 standards , but there is concern that if the standards become more mainstream , there will be more pressure for home - schooled students to conform to them			1
a majority of states do not require home - schooled students to take a standardized assessment			1
in those that do , parents are offered a range of standardized assessments they can use , so it 's possible that home - schooling students in some states could take a @entity2 - based assessment or that in future years there will be fewer options for these students , @entity167 said			1
' that 's the concern we have , that our students are going to be marginalized by this @entity2 system and we 'll have difficulty and we 'll be pressured and pulled into kind of participating , and we do n't want to do that , ' @entity167 said			2
today , home schooling is much more acceptable than it was in the past , and an estimated 3 percent of students are educated at home today , according to @entity205 statistics			2
years of political battles taught these families to be ' very politically savvy ' , @entity121 said			0
@entity208 , executive vice president of the @entity209 , an education think tank , has testified before state legislative bodies in favor of the standards			2
he said the issue goes beyond the standards themselves			0
' this is much more of a fundamental , ideological concern for them ' , he said			0
@entity221 , a former @entity105 administration @entity205 official who is the executive vice president for policy at the liberal @entity223 , said she finds home - schooling parents ' opposition to the standards a bit ' perplexing '			1
' those families make a personal choice , which is a legitimate choice that they are going to handle their child 's education at home , so the @entity2 does n't really affect them ' , @entity228 said			1
' they have the option just like a private school to decide what curriculum is going to be used for their children			2
' @entity239 , a home - schooling dad in @entity240 , @entity241 , runs two conservative - bent web sites and has done contract work for the @entity122			1
he said that even though his family is ' going to do what we 're going to do anyway ' , he 's concerned about what the standards will do to public education			0
' a one size fits all approach does not work and that 's one of the primary reasons many of us homeschool , ' @entity239 said .			0

more parents are pulling their children out of school because of the new educational standards
