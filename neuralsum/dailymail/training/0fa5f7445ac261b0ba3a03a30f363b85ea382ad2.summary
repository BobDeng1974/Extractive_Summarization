by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:53 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 29 december 2012 almost 6,000 drivers have been banned from the road because they can not see properly , new figures show			1
the number of licences revoked or blocked soared by 10 per cent higher in 2011 , amid growing fears about the eyesight of thousands of people who climb behind the wheel			1
officials tore up 5,285 licences for cars and motorbikes and 685 lorry and bus drivers last year because holders could not pass a standard eye test			1
in 2011 almost 6,000 people had their driving licences revoked or blocked because of their eyesight , a 10 per cent rise on 2010 in 2010 , 4,906 car and motorcycle licences were revoked or refused , along with 493 lorry or bus applications			1
among lorry and bus drivers the increase was a shocking 39 per cent			2
transport minister @entity29 revealed the figures for 2011 in response to a series of parliamentary questions from @entity35 mp @entity34			1
mr @entity29 told @entity1 : ' licensing rules have an important part to play in keeping our roads safe			0
we must make sure that only those who are safe to drive are allowed on our roads while at the same time avoiding placing unnecessary restrictions on people ’s independence			0
all drivers must meet certain minimum eyesight standards			2
there are additional checks for drivers of large goods vehicles and passenger carrying vehicles , which we strictly enforce			0
' this is to protect the driver and other road users given their size , the number of passengers and the likely additional distance and time spent on the road			1
' driving with defective eyesight is an offence and a driver who does not meet the required standard could be prosecuted			1
they may also invalidate their motor insurance			0
ms @entity34 said : ' a recent report showed that in 2010 road accidents caused by poor driver vision resulted in an estimated 2,874 casualties			1
' these figures provide information on how many drivers who have come forward and reported problems with their vision to the @entity76 had their licenses revoked or refused			0
' i will be continuing to seek further information to ensure that robust measures are in place to check drivers ’ vision , so we can continue to improve road safety			1
for most people it is simply a matter of getting their eyes tested to ensure they have glasses or contact lenses if required			2
' under @entity95 rules , all drivers should be able to read a number plate from 20 metres away , with glasses or contact lenses if necessary			2
they should also be able to pass an eye test with an optician and have an adequate field of vision			0
the government has ruled out introducing formal eyesight testing whenever a driving licence is renewed			1
instead , it is up to drivers to ensure that they are able to meet the appropriate vision standards while driving			1
police officers are able to carry out roadside eye tests if they think a driver does not meet the minimum requirements			0
if the driver fails the roadside test , the police can inform the @entity76 who will revoke the driving licence			2
last month a survey by @entity117 found one in three drivers were putting themselves and others at risk by failing to meet the legal vision standard required for driving			2

by 2032 the number aged over 70 will have risen to 5.8million , and the total will include almost two million over 80 , the @entity131 said			2
earlier this month 87 - year - old @entity134 was released from jail on appeal , after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and making a false statement to obtain a driving license after twice lying to the @entity76 about his eyesight			1
@entity143 , @entity144 in @entity145 , ran over and killed war veteran @entity146 , 86 , in january			0
@entity134 was jailed for 18 months , but the @entity147 said it was ‘ wrong in principle ’ for the frail pensioner to remain behind bars			0
the court heard how after the accident @entity134 was seen using a magnifying glass to use his mobile phone even whilst wearing glasses			0
it was later found that he could only read a number plate from just eight metres			0
on appeal @entity134 ’s jail term was quashed and he was handed a 51 week suspended sentence , with a 12 - month supervision requirement			0
