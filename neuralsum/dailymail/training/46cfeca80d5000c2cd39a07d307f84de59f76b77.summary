@entity0 just turned five last month and all she can think about is starting ‘ big girl school ’ next year and growing up to be a ‘ princess ballerina ’			1
only a few months ago , these dreams were looking far from realistic , but thanks to her three - year - old brother @entity6 – things are well and truly looking up for the beautiful little girl			1
there was a 25 per cent chance of @entity6 being a bone marrow match for his older sister @entity0 , 5 , from the @entity12 in @entity13 , who was in desperate need of a helping hand after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia , a type of blood cancer which particularly hits children			1
but @entity6 did so much more than that by providing a very rare ' perfect match ' with his sibling – a moment his mother , @entity24 , has described as nothing short of ' magical '			1
@entity0 dreams of one day growing up to be a ‘ princess ballerina ’ the magical moment when @entity0 ( left ) saw her brother @entity6 ( right ) for the time after the bone marrow transplant operation five weeks later only 17 months apart in age , @entity0 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) have always had a close relationship @entity0 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) at the @entity33 in @entity34 ‘ it was just awesome – we were just ecstatic to know @entity6 was able to help her to heal and be a part of her journey , ’ she told @entity35			1
@entity0 was categorised in the low risk category when she was diagnosed in december but within three months , after chemotherapy , she rapidly escalated to extremely high risk with just a 40 per cent chance of recovery			1
‘ i was glad i was sitting down when i got the news – i was absolutely beside myself , ’ she said			0
but the best possible news was delivered to the family in march when @entity6 had an unusual 10 out of 10 bone marrow match with his sister			1
' i did have a mother 's instinct that he would be a match , but it was amazing when the news came , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
the way @entity24 and her husband @entity57 explained to their three year - old son that he was going to be the unique gift to @entity0 was by reading him a book			2
' we sat down and explained to him with a superhero story , and he thought it was an awesome story , she said			0
@entity0 has been her mother @entity24 's tower of strength throughout the long journey their mother describes her son and daughter as having a bond as strong as a pair of twins @entity6 had 280ml of barrow marrow removed , which was transplanted into @entity0 just a few hours later on july 9			1
amazingly , his young body has replaced this marrow within a few weeks			2
‘ he woke and all he wanted to do was see @entity0 , but she was in isolation so he waved at her through the window , ’ she said			1
when the pair reunited five weeks later , @entity24 was glad to have her camera on hand to capture the heart - warming moment			0
the huge grin on @entity0 ’s face spoke a million words when she held her little brother			2
‘ he ran into the room and they just embraced , ’ she said			0
‘ they do n’t go well when they do n’t see each other for a while			0
’ only 17 months apart in age , @entity0 and @entity6 have always had a close relationship which has significantly strengthened since the beginning of this special journey			1
‘ she has always been like his little mother since he was born and he ’s her strength – they are more like twins , ’ she said			0
‘ and now they have a bond that will never be broken – it has been magical to watch it grow			0
’ @entity0 has a very strong understanding of the incredible gift she has been given by her brother @entity6 the inseparable pair have a special bond that will never be broken @entity0 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) ca n't bare spending long periods of time apart from one another when @entity24 and her husband , @entity57 , had to tell @entity0 who was only four at the time , that she was sick , they decided to break it down in a way she would easily understand			1
‘ i told her that the chemo was pacman , who had to eat the nasties inside her , ’ she said			0
but when the chemotherapy was n't successful , they had another chat with their daughter about her brother helping out			0
her instant response proved her extraordinary understanding of a complex situation for a child who had not yet turned five			0
‘ @entity138 is not doing a good enough job so @entity6 ’s super cells are going in to help			2
but @entity138 is still on guard to help kill them off if they come back , ’ @entity0 told her parents			2
' she ’s an intelligent young girl , ’ her mother said			0
‘ she ’s my strength and always has positivity			0
’ ‘ she says “ i ’ll get those nasties ” – it ’s been an amazing journey			0
’ six weeks after her transplant , @entity0 was given the all clear for the first time			2
but thursday is the big day for @entity0 as she has her 100 - day test			1
