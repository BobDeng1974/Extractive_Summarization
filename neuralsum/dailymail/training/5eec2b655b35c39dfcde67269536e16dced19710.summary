mrs @entity17 and her staff ensured that the baby elephant had food and water as rangers headed out on the reserve to track down her mother			1
mrs @entity17 , who has owned the reserve for 15 years , said she has never experienced anything like this – and was shocked to find that the baby was the calf of an elephant her husband had rescued several years earlier			1
‘ she must be like the littlest hobo as baby elephants never ever get lost from their herd			2
‘ it 's also remarkable that she ended up at my home - we have 4,500 hectares of land and she was spotted a day before she arrived at my home with her herd at the other end of the reserve			2
tiny dancer : after wandering into the garden , the ten - day - old elephant make its way into the @entity79 's living room @entity23 nom nom : game rangers @entity81 and @entity83 feed the distressed baby elephant in an attempt to calm it down while its mother was tracked down where 's mummy ? the young elephant is thought to have travelled for several miles , after getting separated from its mother and the rest of the herd , before ending up in @entity30 's living room @entity23 , meet tom : @entity23 the baby elephant with chef @entity97 , who originally found her in the garden , in @entity10 , @entity7 ‘ she had walked miles to get here and was quite distressed when she arrived - she looked tired , thirsty and hungry			1
’ mrs @entity17 and her staff left @entity23 the elephant free to roam and were careful not to have too much contact with the animal , fearing it might make her mother reject her			1
‘ her mother - who we rescued from a neighbouring reserve which was going to allow a hunter in to shoot her - was delighted when @entity23 was finally reunited with her			2
‘ i ca n't say the same for @entity23 - she must be a bit of a renegade as she tried to run after the van as we pulled away			0
‘ she was only here for a few hours before we managed to get her back but it was magical			0
‘ her herd was monitored overnight to make sure everything was fine and she was accepted back in			0
‘ it really is a remarkable rescue story			0
i tried to take photos but could n't use the flash as i did n't want to startle her			0

‘ @entity140 was famous for the work he did saving elephants and even saved @entity23 's mother - people are saying the elephant needed saving and was drawn here			1
‘ i do n't really know about that but i am sure that she could n't have spent much longer out there alone			0
