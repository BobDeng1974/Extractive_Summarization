they warned mr @entity7 he faced legal action if he failed to pay - but @entity29 eventually agreed to let him pay off the outstanding bill at £ 3.55 a week			1
it means he will be 97 - years - old when the balance is cleared			0
the grandfather - of - ten said : ' the letter came as a massive shock			0
as far as i was concerned the work i did over the years was of a good quality and added value to the house			2
' we lived there for 20 years so were bound to change some things and i wanted to make the place looking nice			1
i ’m not a @entity27 disaster - far from it , i used to work in the building trade			0
' we decorated the house and i put a shed in the back garden			2
i changed a couple of the doors inside to ones that were more expensive and i fitted a new sink in the kitchen			1
handy man : mr @entity7 had also built his own shed , apparently with a collection of wooden planks , pictured above , at the property in @entity36 , @entity32 , before the couple moved out earlier this year costly : but when mr @entity7 and his wife moved out of the property in @entity36 , @entity32 , to a smaller bungalow , they were sent a £ 5,000 bill to cover the cost of fixing his @entity98 work ' i also fitted a security light to make sure we could deter burglars - and moved a light in one of the rooms , but i got an electrician to do that for me			1
it was good job - not some fly - by - night cowboy operation			0
' we ’re pensioners and ca n’t afford to pay this amount of money			0
it ’s unfair they ’re taking this out on us			0
all of the work was carried out by professionals i know through my career in the building trade and was completed with quality materials			2
i ca n’t believe these people are saying its botched job			0
' the elderly couple were sent the bill after downsizing to a smaller bungalow a mile away in nearby @entity126			1
as an incentive , @entity29 even promised £ 300 to aid his move			0
but just months after settling into their new home the letter dropped through the letter box saying he was liable for £ 4,977 of ' rechargeable repairs '			2
it said £ 178 pounds was being billed for a ' cleanse ’ to the property which it then said referred to items being removed which had been left behind			2
debt : mr @entity7 has been told by @entity29 that he can pay back the bill at £ 3.55 a week - meaning he will be 97 - years - old when the balance is cleared the letter added : ' £ 2,500 is a for full electrical re-wire which was necessary due to major and dangerous diy electrics both internally and externally to the property			1

i ca n’t believe they are chasing me for this money			0
it ’s not much for them but it ’s a phenomenal amount for me			0
charges : this copy of the bill sent to mr @entity7 shows the breakdown of the costs of repairing his diy work - reaching a total of £ 4,977.74 ' i said to them : " what am i actually paying for ? " the reality is it will take so long to settle the balance , i ’ll be dead before i ’ve paid it all off			1
' mr @entity7 's local @entity176 , which has written to the housing association on his behalf , said : ' we believe that our client , however misguided , carried out certain work in good faith and in the belief that he was in fact improving the property			1
' considering the simultaneous regeneration of the area and , as we understand it , this property we would like to request that the debt be written off			0
' but @entity191 from @entity29 said : ' tenants have a right to make improvements and alterations but there are requirements to ensure works are carried out to a certain standard			2
written consent must be sought from us before any work is carried out			2
' specifically the must comply with planning or building regulations and any work related to electricity or gas apparatus systems or equipment has to be carried out by a suitably qualified person			0
' the tenancy handbook also clearly states that if a customer carries out improvement work either without first seeking our permission or after we have refused permission they could end up reinstating the property to its original condition			0
' we may also take legal action for breaching tenancy conditions			0
' mr @entity191 added : ' the tenancy agreement states that if or when a customer moves out of a home they must either leave the improvement in good working order or remove it and make good the original fitting at their expense so we can re-let the property			0
' failure to do this will mean a recharge for putting right any work that is not of the required standard , is unsafe unfinished or is in any breach of any other regulation			0
' new home : @entity7 and @entity236 were given £ 300 to entice them to move to a smaller property , pictured , but it has ended up costing them thousands of pounds more			1
