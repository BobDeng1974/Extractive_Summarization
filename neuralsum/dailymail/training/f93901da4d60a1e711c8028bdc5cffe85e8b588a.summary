@entity0 has unveiled electronic wristbands that store information and allow its theme parks to track visitors			1
@entity6 , as they are playfully called , completely do away with paper tickets , room keys and even credit cards through the use of microchips			1
they also transmit personal information to sensor - wearing mascots , log visitor buying habits and even tailor rides to the people on them , according to the @entity18			2
it 's magic ! : just wave the wristbands at sensors deployed around theme parks and you 're let onto rides , can pay for food and even enter your hotel room the waterproof rubber wristbands use @entity29 technology – a low frequency radio transmission currently used for things like transit cards and some tap to pay technologies			1
@entity29 technology only works at close distances			1
magicbands replace theme park entry tickets and @entity39 , hotel room keys and credit cards			1
they send names and birthdates to mascots – leading to them possibly greeting children by name			0
‘ hi , @entity49 ! ’ as the @entity50 put it			0
people waiting on line for certain rides will have entertainment and information fed to them on video screens based on observed spending and park migration habits			2
the theme park manages the monitoring of guests using the @entity63 + ‘ vacation management system , ’ according to the @entity50			0
the danger within : the wristbands use @entity68 technology , which techies posting to @entity0 forums worry can be cracked by even a cell phone happy birthday ! : the data on the wristbands can also be used to tell mascots park visitors ' names and birthdays , allowing them to provide personalized greetings a consumer version of the platform is made available to vacationers to manage the information added to the wristbands including park passes , dining credits and even @entity87			1
information is input using an app available in either of the popular mobile app markets			0
the @entity37 are currently in a limited beta testing phase , according to @entity0 , but are expected to be made available to all theme park guests			1
despite growing outrage over @entity97 spying and the increasing lack of privacy on @entity100 and other social media sites , vacationers ca n’t wait to slap them on , according to comments on a well - read review of the bracelets			0
the review posted to @entity0 fan site @entity108 suggests the only major problem with the bands , which can be adorned with charms depicting a multitude of popular @entity0 characters , is their functionality			2
no mention of privacy issues is made anywhere in the write - up			0
they also track you : park officials can also use the wristbands to track movements and chart spending habits tech buffs posting to one of many @entity0 theme park - related forums expressed concerns that cell phones could access and possibly clone the information stored on the bands			2
much of the criticism was leveled at @entity0 ’s choice of ‘ easily readable ’ rf technology over the more secure @entity136 ( @entity136 ) standard			1
purchases made using the bands would require the use of a pin code , but only if they exceed $ 50 , according to a previous @entity142 report			0
the @entity144 review noted that it was nearly impossible to get those pin codes to work			0
a @entity0 spokesperson also told the @entity50 that no personal information will be stored on the wristbands			2
park visitors commenting on the @entity152 review have had mixed results – but none have spoken of privacy issues .			0
