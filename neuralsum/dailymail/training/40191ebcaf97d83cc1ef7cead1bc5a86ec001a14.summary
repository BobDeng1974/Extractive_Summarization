@entity1 ’s promise to curb immigration was shattered yesterday by figures revealing it has hit the highest level on record			1
annual net migration – the measure of how many people have come into @entity10 minus those who have left – has reached nearly 300,000			1
when he took power in 2010 mr @entity1 pledged to bring this politically sensitive figure below 100,000			0
a total of 624,000 people migrated to @entity10 in the 12 months up to last september while 327,000 left			1
the inflow is up 94,000 on the year before			2
last year 300,000 migrants arrived in @entity10 , with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the @entity17 net long - term migration to the @entity10 was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier the fact that most of the extra migrants – 190,000 of the net inflow of 298,000 – came from countries outside the @entity17 provides further embarrassment for the prime minister			1
unlike @entity17 citizens , these people have no automatic right to work here and the government had pledged to slash their numbers			1
there were increasing numbers of arrivals from the @entity37 sub-continent and a rise in ‘ chain migration ’ where existing migrants bring in their relatives			2
opposition politicians said mr @entity1 ’s immigration policy was ‘ in tatters ’ and pro-immigration pressure groups said he should instead focus on improving the lives of new arrivals			2
@entity49 mp @entity48 said last night : ‘ every set of immigration data reinforces the need to control our borders			2
‘ how can one expect a country to maintain its common identity and memories when in one year the population change alone was almost one million people – 327,000 leaving and 624,000 arriving			1
‘ that ’s over a one - seventieth change in the entire population			0
' at this rate in the next parliament it ’ll be the equivalent to the whole of inner @entity69 ’s population being changed			0
’ @entity70 described the figures as a ‘ disappointment ’ but also a reflection of a strong economy			2
the highest numbers previously recorded were 600,000 in september 2010			2
when mr @entity1 entered @entity70 in may 2010 net migration was running at 244,000			1
net migration from the @entity17 hit 162,000 in the year ending september 2014 , up from 130,000 in the previous year a total of 37,000 @entity79 and @entity80 arrived in the @entity10 , up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months ' we would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands			1
' @entity1 , jan 2010 ' levels of immigration can return to where they were in the 1980s and 90s			0
net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year			1
that 's a promise we made to the @entity10 people			1
' @entity1 , april 2011 ' when we made that comment ... we were very clear that was what we wanted to do			0
it remains the objective towards which the prime minister and others are working			1
' @entity101 , nov 10 ' it is , of course , unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the @entity105			0
' @entity101 , nov 23 yesterday ’s 298,000 figure has been surpassed only once , in 2005			0
while eastern @entity110 immigration remains steady , the majority of @entity17 migrants now come from @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , which all have moribund economies and high youth unemployment			1
the figures also show that nearly 200,000 @entity79 and @entity80 applied for national insurance numbers to work in the @entity10 in @entity120 only 37,000 were registered as arriving in the 12 months to september of that year – suggesting that tens of thousands were here before the lifting of labour restrictions that january			1
@entity125 , of the @entity49 - leaning @entity126 think tank , said : ‘ in light of these numbers , the government urgently needs to broaden its focus to the experiences and impact of migrants once they arrive			0
‘ they need to do more to address the pressures of immigration , including on local authorities , schools , gps and social cohesion			0
’ prime minister @entity1 promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands but lord @entity145 @entity10 , a campaign group which has a record of accurate projections of immigration , said : ‘ these figures will be extremely disappointing for the public			1
the additional pressure on housing and public services is clearly unmanageable			0
this outcome is a wake - up call to redouble efforts to tackle mass immigration			0
’ he added : ‘ if political leaders are content with net migration of 300,000 , they should say so			1
otherwise they should pledge to continue with a target and set out policies to achieve it			2
‘ a problem as serious as this requires serious money			0
‘ we call on all political parties to double the resources available for immigration control , which now account for only 0.25 per cent of government expenditure			2
’ a new poll today showed people are most concerned about the impact of immigration on the @entity176 and the economy in an interview with @entity179 , mr @entity1 defended his policy and blamed the booming @entity10 economy for attracting workers from around the world			1
' outside the @entity17 , immigration has come down , thanks to the action we have taken since 2010 , for example , closing down 700 bogus colleges			2
' but inside the @entity17 , migration has gone up , partly because @entity10 's economy has been strong and we 've been creating 1,000 new jobs a day , which is why i have put forward tough welfare policies that i will secure as part of our renegotiation with the @entity17			1
' there are four parts to it – firstly , if someone comes to the @entity10 from the @entity17 to look for work , they do not get unemployment benefit			1
' secondly , if they have not found work after six months , they will be forced to return home			0
thirdly , if they do find work here they will not be able to claim in - work benefits like tax credits or social housing for four years			0
and fourthly they will no longer be able to send home child benefit to their country of origin			0
' mr @entity1 has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue mr @entity1 had hoped to use his immigration speech last year to announce a cap on the numbers of people who can come to @entity10 from elsewhere in the @entity17			1
but the idea was jettisoned by @entity229 chancellor @entity228 , who insisted there could be no question of altering freedom of movement rules			0
@entity125 , from the @entity126 think tank , said : ' these figures confirm that the net migration target has failed			1
in light of these numbers , the government urgently needs to broaden its focus to the experiences and impact of migrants once they arrive in @entity10			2
' they need to do more to address the pressures of immigration , including on local authorities , schools , gps and social cohesion			0
' no wonder they tried to bury the bad news analysis by @entity253 home secretary @entity101 , pictured , had long - since downgraded the prime minister 's immigration pledge to ' a comment ' little wonder that officials tried so cynically to bury yesterday ’s immigration figures beneath the findings of the @entity261 inquiry			1
for , no matter how hard the @entity263 might look , there was n’t a crumb of comfort to be found for @entity1			0
for more than two years , it had been apparent he would miss his 2010 election promise to cut net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
the lowest total the government ever achieved was 154,000 in september 2012 and since then it has been rising steadily			0
indeed , @entity101 – knowing failure was inevitable – had long since downgraded the prime minister ’s pledge to a ‘ comment ’			1
but the excuse the @entity263 could always fall back on was that it was all the fault of the @entity17 and free movement directives that mr @entity1 plans to renegotiate , if the @entity229 will let him			2
migration from outside the @entity17 – which they could control – had been cut sharply , ministers insisted			1
yesterday that fig leaf was pulled away as the number of incomers rose in every significant category			0
immigration for the purposes of study was up from 175,000 to 192,000 in the year to september 2014			2
the number getting visas for family reunion – including weddings – was up from 66,000 to 90,000			0
asylum applications rose by 6 per cent to 24,914			0
overall , net migration from outside the @entity17 was 190,000			1
in other words , if @entity17 migration had not added a single person to the @entity10 population , mr @entity1 would still have missed his ‘ tens of thousands ’ target by 90,000			1
it ’s hard to think of an election promise being broken more spectacularly			0
home secretary mrs may did try			0
hundreds of bogus colleges were closed down , sham marriages were disrupted and it was made far harder to get a family reunion visa			0
but the immigration system remains like a balloon : squeeze one route into the @entity10 and a bulge appears elsewhere			2
mrs may was also opposed in her reforms every step of the way by the @entity318 , the @entity313 and the vocal universities sector – all of which are convinced mass immigration is the only route to prosperity .			0
