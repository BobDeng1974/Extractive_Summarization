the committee hired @entity38 in january to lead a probe into the state 's @entity51 governor and his appointees , at least three of whom are linked to an apparent plot to snarl traffic in the @entity9 town of @entity58 as payback for its mayor 's failure to endorse @entity3 's 2013 re-election bid			1
@entity2 and @entity63 , a former senior @entity3 campaign official , insist that the @entity12 's right against self - incrimination should protect them from turning over documents that might point to their guilt in the alleged scheme			1
superior court judge @entity71 quizzed @entity38 on the former officials ' legal argument that giving documents to @entity38 would be tantamount to testifying against themselves – something the @entity12 says they can avoid			0
' if that were true , ' @entity38 responded , ' essentially every single subpoena would be open to the @entity12			0
' @entity77 , @entity2 's attorney , said monday that she would show up personally in court , a step she did n't have to take			0

under fire : @entity2 is accused of being part of a plot to deliberately snarl up traffic on the @entity89 to get back at a mayor who refused to endorse @entity3 highs and lows : @entity2 seemed relieved after she was clear of the cameras outside the court			2
her taking the @entity12 has led some to speculate she could be angling for legal immunity at a later date @entity63 ( @entity117 ) is a former @entity3 campaign manager who was implicated in a string of emails related to the bidge closures the pugnacious @entity3 's approval numbers have dropped but he remains a viable 2016 presidential contender , aided by the direct , no - nonsense style that he brought to a town hall meeting with constituents on march 4 @entity63 's lawyer , @entity127 , argued that the legislature 's democrats do n't have the right to demand thousands of documents that they suspect might suggest his participation in a partisan attack on @entity58 mayor @entity136			1
but @entity38 told judge @entity71 that emails already in his possession point to the existence of many others			2
' i 'm really sorry for causing you this much stress this close to november , ' @entity63 wrote in one email			0
@entity127 read all five emails aloud in court , dismissing @entity38 's argument and saying they do n't constitute ' reasonable particularized knowledge ' or a ' foregone conclusion ' – the legal standards – that more documents are waiting to be discovered			2
@entity127 argued that the government 's position is that ' we do n't have any idea what exists , but we 'd like you to tell us			0
' tuesday 's hearing is crucial to @entity9 legislators ' continuing investigation into the actions of @entity3 's staffers , because if @entity71 quashes the subpoenas , all three of the key @entity7 figures will have blocked committee @entity34 .			1
