plans have been unveiled to create a new £ 39billion airport for @entity2 - in the middle of the @entity4			1
engineers unveiled the proposals for a four runway airport , which would ease pressure on the @entity10 's overburdened runways , on a man - made island 1.8 miles off the coast of @entity13 on underwater banks known as @entity15			1
construction firm @entity16 are touting the site as the answer to @entity2 's need for a new hub airport			1
proposals : engineers have unveiled ambitious plans to create this £ 39 billion airport for @entity2 - in the middle of the channel modern : the plans feature a state - of - the - art terminal building and four runways the plans feature a state - of - the - art terminal building and runways connected to @entity2 by a high - speed underground rail link			1
the hazardous sands are said to the perfect location as there pose no environmental , economical or social risk			2
the four runways will sit 1.5km apart so that they can operate independently and taking off and landing over water rather not an urban area will allow 24 - hour flights			1
no homes will have to be demolished and developers say there would be no concerns of damage to conservation or wildlife			0
@entity16 director @entity49 said the proposal was the most ' sustainable solution ' yet to be put forward			2
he said : ' we believe that an offshore hub airport is the only option that can realistically provide the four new , independent runways that research reveals @entity2 needs			1
terminal : the airport blueprint is the latest option put forward that could solve the @entity61 's aviation problems ' if the @entity62 endorses the long - term requirement for a new , four runway hub airport for @entity2 , then locating it at @entity15 will have the least adverse social and environmental impact of any option			1
' it is certainly the most sustainable solution available			0
' creating a new airport for @entity2 presents a major regenerative opportunity			2
' we believe that @entity13 is an area that could benefit most from the boost of new jobs and economic uplift			2
links : the airport would have a high speed rail line direct to @entity2 ' the location of an airport offshore is an alternative that crowded island nation 's are turning to across the globe			1
' it is the solution recently adopted at @entity87 's new @entity86 and at @entity88 in @entity89 and in @entity90			0
' it is not the first time that developers have mooted plans for an airport in the @entity96 , with other proposals including designs for a runway at the @entity100			2
but the latest developers say that other sites have ' significant disadvantages ' compared to their project			0
options : @entity107 's preferred choice is ' @entity108 ' but he may also consider @entity110 expansion and now a third option in the channel mr @entity49 added : ' each proposal is located in at least one internationally designated , environmentally sensitive area			0
' all the sites either interfere with shipping lanes or else are too small to provide four runways sufficiently spaced for independent operation			0
' the proposed site is within @entity61 territorial waters and would be owned by the @entity121			0
passengers from the airport could be in @entity2 within 40 minutes thanks to the rail link which would connect up with the current @entity127 line , with further connections to @entity129 planned via @entity130			1
two major roads , the @entity132 and @entity133 , lead to the site			0
although @entity2 mayor @entity107 has already openly backed a bid for the ' @entity108 ' - @entity137 's designs for an island airport also in the @entity96 - his advisor @entity139 said he had been encouraged by the new designs			1
he said : ' the mayor has been encouraging proposals for a new airport to the east of @entity2			2
' this proposal is welcome as a contribution to a critical national debate and as a demonstration that a new airport is feasible and deliverable			0
' the arguments for the construction of a new hub airport in the @entity61 are overwhelming and this proposal offers one option of how to build it			0
' we now urgently need to recognise that a new hub airport is the answer to our aviation capacity problems and press ahead with considering the best way to deliver that airport			0
' plans for @entity137 's airport on an island in the @entity96 were unveiled in september this year and include four floating runways tethered to the river bed			1
vision : this is what @entity110 could look like it it was turned into a four - runway superhub plans : how @entity110 would look on the map if it was extended plans to extend @entity61 's busiest airport @entity176 were put forward in the same month as part of the government 's review into airport expansion in the @entity10			1
earlier this week @entity107 put the idea of expanding @entity110 back on the table as a way of solving the @entity61 's aviation headache as he fights tooth and nail to block the @entity176 expansion			0
though @entity108 is undoubtedly his current first choice , it is understood he will now order a £ 3million detailed feasibility study to consider if ' compromise option ' @entity110 could cope if transformed			0
a high speed rail link would also be built cutting journey time to @entity2 from the @entity195 site to just 25 minutes			1
proposed location : the airport will be built 1.8miles off the coast of @entity13 on underwater banks known as @entity15 plans : lord @entity137 's £ 50billion design for @entity108 that would sit in the @entity96 and handle 150 million passengers a year if suitable , @entity110 's growth could be put at the heart of the @entity206 's 2015 general election manifesto as a fall - back from @entity108 and building a third runway at @entity176			1
but it will still be highly controversial as proposals for a second runway there have already led to years of protests from people living under its flighpath			2
@entity110 has been targeted by many protests including one where more than 50 people burst onto its runway and shut it down for more than five hours			0
transport experts fear @entity61 could miss out on crucial revenue from tourists and flight taxes if major carriers move their @entity129 base to rivals on the continent .			0

@entity16 unveiled the proposals for the four - runway airport today
it would sit on a man - made island 1.8 miles off the coast of @entity13
four runways would sit separately and operate independently
a high speed rail link direct to @entity2 would be built
the plans pose ' no conservation or environmental risks '
