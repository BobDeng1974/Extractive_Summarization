sir @entity44 , a regular best - seller , slipped from last year ’s number two to six			1
sales of 2013 calendars are reported to be up 10 per cent , mainly on the strength of @entity13 ’s popularity , who are outselling the rest of the top 10 combined			1
@entity10 merchandise buyer @entity54 said : ' @entity13 topped the @entity55 for 2012 , and it looks like they have no competition , athough @entity10 are experiencing a demand for @entity1 ’s raunchy debut calendar this week , so we may well see a festive surge from him too			1

( - ) the wanted @entity30 bronze medallist @entity1 , 18 , appears in a variety of poses - some of them shirtless and covered in water			1
but @entity1 has admitted that his calendar is ' almost a bit of a mick take			2
' he said : ' the one on the front cover where i ’m covered in water was really funny to do			0
someone had to pound a bucket of water over me , it was n’t cold , it was sort of lukewarm			0
it took a few takes to get to get it right through because the water needed to be in the right place			0
' he continued : ' i ’m going to give it to all my friends at @entity106 , it will be a funny present			0
' my friends all think the calendar is really funny			0
it ’s a mick take almost			0
it ’s the first calendar i ’ve done and it was good fun			0
i really enjoyed it and i just hope people like it			0
' apparently the @entity115 said there is a lot of interest in it			0
' although the 18 - year - old might look as if butter would n't melt in his mouth , some of the shots featured in the calendar reveal that he has a saucy side			0
among the photos are several shirtless shots , including one that sees him wrestling with a turquoise fine knit jumper			2
unsurprisingly though , @entity1 , of @entity132 , @entity133 , says his favourite picture falls on his birthday month of may , which shows him receiving his bronze medal at the @entity30			2
in total , nine of the twelve photos show off his toned , tanned torso , although three are action shots			0
the remaining images show off @entity1 's conservative sense of style , including a scrubbed up shot of the diver sporting a lilac cotton shirt			1
although @entity1 has never modelled in an advertising campaign , he 's no stranger to editorial photo shoots and has posed - in varying states of undress - for numerous @entity154 magazines and newspapers .			1

@entity1 's effort sees off competition from @entity41 and @entity44
boy band @entity13 take the top spot with @entity15 in second
