by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 29 march 2013 prize - winning photography of life - threatening illnesses will be on display in @entity4 , @entity5 , at the @entity7 ’s annual competition showcasing the beauty of cells and a close - up view what deadly diseases look like			1
one of the winning images was a cervical cancer cell captured in the process of cell division , taken by dr @entity17 of the @entity18 for @entity19 , @entity20			1
it shows the role that the very latest imaging technology can play in helping scientists to understand the inner workings of human cells			0
red alert : @entity29 from the @entity30 , @entity28 was the overall winner of the @entity32 , with her close - up shot of cancer cells this is playing an important role to aid the discovery of new , more effective and targeted drugs to treat diseases such as cancer by stopping diseased cells from replicating			1
this groundbreaking technology , known as ‘ super resolution microscopy ’ , enables structures inside a cell , which play a crucial role in cell division ( ‘ microtubules ’ coloured yellow in the image ) , to be seen more clearly than ever before , although their diameter is in fact just 1000th of the thickness of a human hair			0
disease in detail : this image of @entity59 's disease won @entity60 from @entity62 first place in the high - content analysis category this technology is special because it allows things to be seen at a greater level of detail than before			1
it is an example of some of the innovations being developed by @entity7 which are shaping the face of medicine of the future			0
the @entity20 is one of the first universities in the world to invest in this imaging technology			1
cervical cancer is the 11th most common cancer among women in the @entity80 , and the most common cancer in women under 35			0
scary beauty : the cervical cancer cell is brought into focus by @entity17 from the @entity20 cervical screening saves approximately 4,500 lives per year in @entity88			1
the winners of the @entity32 include @entity29 from the @entity30 of @entity28 , in the microscopy section			0
her image was in the disease focus of cancer , a @entity95 epithelial cell stained for microtubules ( red ) , kinetochores ( green ) and @entity98 ( blue )			1
@entity60 from @entity62 won first place for his image for @entity59 ’s disease stem cells			0
@entity59 ’s disease becomes noticeable in mid-adult life and is the most common genetic cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called chorea			0
under the microscope : a beautiful but deadly image of @entity110 , a progressive failure of the immune system that allows life - threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive incredible images of cervical cancer cells won @entity17 , from the @entity18 at @entity20 , the award of regional winner in the microscopy section			1
@entity119 , general manager of research and @entity121 , @entity122 , said : ' this year ’s winning images are as beautiful and compelling as ever			2
neurological disorders : conditions include paralysis , muscle weakness , poor coordination , loss of sensation , seizures , confusion , pain and altered levels of consciousness ' not only can they be appreciated from an aesthetic point of view , but they remind us of the cellular complexity behind disease and why the study of cells is so important			2
' we were delighted to receive so many outstanding entries to the competition , which highlights how high - content and super-resolution cell imaging are helping scientists explore the universe of the cell , and so advance our understanding of so many life threatening and life - limiting diseases			1
' starting in the mid- 1990s , the emphasis in clinical cancer research shifted towards therapies derived from biotechnology research , such as immunotherapy and gene @entity161 funding for cancer research comes from taxpayers and charities , rather than from profit - making businesses			2
in the @entity166 , less than 30 per cent of all cancer research is funded by commercial researchers such as pharmaceutical companies			0
[ 15 ] per capita , public spending on cancer research by taxpayers and charities in the @entity166 is seven times as much as public spending by taxpayers and charities in the @entity176			0
as a percentage of @entity179 , the non-commercial funding of cancer research in the @entity166 is four times the amount dedicated to cancer research in @entity182			0
[ 15 ] half of @entity182 's non-commercial cancer research is funded by charitable @entity186 number of teenagers and young adults dying from cancer in @entity80 has fallen from around 580 per year in the mid- 70s ( 1975 - 77 ) to around 300 today ( 2008 - 2010 ) , according to a new @entity191 cancer death rates of teenagers and young adults have fallen by almost a half - from 74.5 to 37.7 per million 15 - 24 years old in @entity80 in the same time period.the focus on specialisation in teenage and young adult care has brought increasing awareness of this group ’s specific needs			1
experts believe that the change in the way that some teenagers and young adults are treated - in a similar way to children rather than adults – means that they are now doing better for some cancers , such as the leukaemias			0
in the last fifteen years in @entity80 , the largest drop in deaths was in the leukaemias - from an average of 54 deaths per year in 1995 - 1999 to 39 deaths in 2006 - 2010 in young males			2
in females , it fell from an average of 38 to 21 deaths per @entity220 there are now fewer young males dying from non-hodgkin lymphoma than there used to be , dropping from an average of 20 deaths per year in 1995 - 1999 to 14 deaths per year in 2006 - 2010 .			2

cervical screening saves approximately 4,500 lives per year in @entity88
