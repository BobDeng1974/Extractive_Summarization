a six - year - old boy who suffers from an incredibly rare condition is not allowed to play outside in the winter , as catching a virus could kill him			1
the genetic disease , which affects just 50 people in the world , means @entity7 struggles to fight off the mildest infection			1
it means even a common cold or simple case of chicken pox could potentially kill him			2
he was diagnosed with @entity13 ( @entity14 ) two years ago , and without a life - saving bone marrow transplant he wo n't survive into adulthood			1
@entity7 , from @entity17 , does n't go out to play in winter as his mother is afraid he will be struck down by just a common cold , which could prove deadly in the winter months , his parents wrap him up warm before he goes to school and do n't like to take the risk of letting him play outside			1
his mother @entity24 said : ' we have had a lot of snow recently and it 's heartbreaking because we ca n't take the risk of letting him play outside			1
' just to get him to school , we have to dress him in thermals , leggings , multiple pairs of socks , a hat and a balaclava			0
you can only see his eyes , it 's so sad but we have to make sure he does n't get cold at all			1
' @entity7 wants to go and build snowmen and have snowball fights but just being outside for ten minutes could put him at risk of a life - threatening infection			2
' although chilly temperatures have not been proven to increase your chance of catching a cold , winter weather may make the inside lining of your nose drier and more vulnerable to viral infection			1
the youngster , from @entity17 , @entity52 , was a sickly child from birth and suffered regularly from colds and sickness bugs			0
but he was finally diagnosed with @entity14 after he contracted salmonella poisoning when he was four - years - old			0
the condition is caused by a mutation in his @entity60 gene			2
after a month in hospital with rehydration treatments , @entity7 was sent home but @entity24 and his dad @entity65 , soon noticed he had relapsed			0
further tests revealed @entity7 's white blood cell count was between 50 and 60 , when it should have been as low as 0.04 in a child of his age			2
ms @entity24 said : ' generally he seemed ok in himself but he picked up lots of coughs and colds			0
we kept going back to hospital but they did n't know what was wrong with him			2
' the doctors could n't understand why his white blood cell count was so high			2
' wrapped - up : @entity79 dresses her son in thermals , leggings , a hat and balaclava to go to school leaving doctors at @entity88 ( @entity88 ) baffled , specialists at @entity91 's @entity90 ( @entity90 ) picked up on the syndrome , after @entity7 was unable to stand on one leg when he got up one morning			0
ms @entity24 , 37 , said : ' he said that he could n't stand on one of his legs			2
i called the doctor and they told me to take him straight to hospital			0
' they did n't know what had happened , he did n't have any broken bones which is what his symptoms suggested			2
' a series of mri scans revealed @entity7 had @entity107 , a trait of @entity14 , which causes infection in the bone after it is spread through the blood			1
@entity7 became so poorly his weight dropped to just 20kg and his spine protruded through his back			0
ms @entity24 had to be trained to give him intravenous injections through a tract which ran just centimetres from his heart , so he could have regular antibiotics , in an attempt to fight off the potentially deadly disease			0
now , the youngster must have a cocktail of antiviral and immunoglobulin therapy injections up to four times a day , which are fed directly into his stomach			0
without the antibodies , @entity127 's immune system would be extremely low and his life would be at risk every time he stepped outside the house			1
but , the treatment is simply a short term fix , and @entity7 must have a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible , to eliminate the syndrome from his body			1
@entity7 , with his parents and brother @entity138			0
he suffers from a condition which affects just 50 people in the world mr @entity65 , a factory worker , said : ' when we heard a bone marrow transplant could cure @entity127 we were over the moon			1
but this quickly turned to fear as our family was tested and no one was a match for @entity7			0
he needs a transplant from a stranger , but so far there 's no one on the @entity153 bone marrow register who 's a suitable match			1
' @entity24 , @entity65 and @entity7 's three - year - old brother @entity138 are appealing for more people to be tested to see if their bone marrow is a match , in a desperate bid to save their son 's life			1
ms @entity24 , a nursery nurse , said : ' the antiviral injections wo n't help him forever , one day he will become immune to them			1
' he urgently needs bone marrow and we are urging people to come forward and be tested			1
even if people do n't match @entity7 , they can be put on the @entity153 register and they are very likely to be able to help someone else , who desperately needs life - saving treatment			1
' @entity7 knows he 's different , he says ' mummy , i 'm a bit more poorly than most people ' and i explain it 's because he needs some special blood to help him feel better			0
' potential donors should be between the ages of 16 - 30 and in good health			0
joining involves filling in a simple medical questionnaire and providing a saliva sample			0
donating bone marrow is usually done through a process a bit like giving blood			1
@entity188 , national recruitment manager at @entity153 , said : ' we need potential donors from the @entity192 community to join the register to give patients like @entity7 a chance of life			2
' patients who are white northern @entity198 have a 90 per cent chance of finding a match , but this falls to 40 per cent for patients from minority ethnic backgrounds			0
' anyone aged 16 - 30 who ca n't attend the event can join online at @entity206			0
we especially need donors from all minority ethnic backgrounds to join			0
