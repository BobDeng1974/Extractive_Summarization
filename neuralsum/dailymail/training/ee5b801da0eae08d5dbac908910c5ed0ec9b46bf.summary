@entity1 , 35 , stole thousands of pounds from the pre-school after her habit of playing an online version of the game left her massively in debt			1
locking stumps , in @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity18 was left just ' days from closure ' after the mother - of - three plundered its account			1
in a desperate bid to prevent it from going bust , the school 's skeleton staff of five agreed to work for free and parents launched fund raising events to help save it			2
@entity1 , an assistant manager at the pre school , admitted theft by employee but a judge at @entity36 told her she only needed to pay back the ' nominal ' sum of a pound due to her ' extensive debts			1
' speaking after the case , @entity40 , a trustee at the nursery which has 29 children on its roll said : ' we appreciate she has young children and a custodial sentence would have been difficult for but we do n’t see what deterrent paying back £ 1 will serve			2
'' the penalty is completely pointless , we do not understand charging her £ 1			2
we were within days of closing , the only reason we did n’t close was because staff worked unpaid for months and the pre-school had to borrow money to pay bills			1
' we can never thank staff enough , to do that shows their dedication			2
the parents in the community have fundraised and supported us to get us where we are today			2
' @entity62 , 28 , a parent of a child at the nursery said : ' everyone is really shocked at the fact that this woman has only had to pay a pound			1
' it ’s ridiculous and it just goes to show people can steal and get away with it			2
it seems the message from the court is go ahead and spend other people ’s money and it will be ok			2
' people have said if this lady was that hard up , they would have leant her the money if she had asked			0
' he added : ' both my kids have been to or go to the pre-school			1
i went in one day to collect my son and the staff were all crying because they did n’t have enough money to pay the wages			0
' the company i own do charity organising so we stepped in to help			0
the pre-school was on the verge of closing and all the parents wondered where would our kids go			2
' we thought it was terrible what happened			0
we did a couple of events at the local pub like charity fundraising evenings , bbqs and raffles			0
locking stumps pre-school was almost forced to close after the mum - of - three siphoned off cash from its account to help pay her online bingo debts ' all the parents in the area rallied around and thankfully we did enough to keep the pre school open			1
if it was n’t for the community doing that then we would n’t have a preschool for our kids now - and all the troubles were down to one woman			0
' our fundraiser raised £ 1,500 in just three weeks and the school staff were over the moon			0
we ’re just so relieved we saved the place from closing down			0
' earlier the court was told @entity1 was responsible for financial affairs at the pre school but began signing cheques to herself			1
her thefts emerged in may last year when trustees realised there was no money in the account			0
prosecutor @entity133 said : ' @entity1 was responsible for the financial affairs and was one of two people authorised to sign cheques on the school account			1
the co-signee was advised by the bank on may 16 that a cheque had bounced			0
“ she was quite sure it should n’t have bounced because there was substantial funds in the account			0
' @entity1 was arrested later and confessed she had been signing cheques as she had debts in the region of £ 20,000 and had already taken out pay day loans to stem her debts caujsed by online bingo			1
she admitted stealing £ 2,212			0
her defence counsel mr @entity152 said : ' it ’s a classic tale in the modern internet age and the accessibility to users of gambling which can be accessed from the comfort of one ’s home in which enormous debts can be run up			1
@entity1 was arrested later and confessed she had been signing cheques as she had debts in the region of £ 20,000 and had already taken out pay day loans to stem her debts caujsed by online bingo			1
she admitted stealing £ 2,212.18 ' effectively her downfall can all link back to when she first discovered the world of online gambling			1
she was paying herself in advance and some times she managed to pay off a significant amount in her own wages but some times she could n’t			0
' she is a pariah in the small community because so many of her neighbours have children who go to the nursery			0
she is not only shunned but has remarks aimed at her in the street			0
' @entity1 was also given a 12 month community order including supervision			1
the judge mr recorder @entity183 told her : ' you had financial difficulties because of your initial and growing interest in online gambling			1
' everyone knows what you have done and the fact there has been a reaction to that is a profound punishment in itself			0
