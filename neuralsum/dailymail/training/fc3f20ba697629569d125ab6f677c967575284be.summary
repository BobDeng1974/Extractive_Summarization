@entity28 refused to insure him at all because of his lack of road experience			1
mr @entity5 , who lives with his parents in @entity31 , said : ' i earn £ 15,000 a year , so i just ca n't afford that on top of everything else			0
' it feels like they need to start taking into account driving qualifications and skills and not just look at your age and think " this guy 's going to be a delinquent teenager and we 've got to hike up the price for him "			0
off the road : @entity5 says he ca n't afford to pay the high insurance costs and will wait until he has had his licence for longer before reapplying ' i have to rely on my parents to take me everywhere - or get the bus			1
