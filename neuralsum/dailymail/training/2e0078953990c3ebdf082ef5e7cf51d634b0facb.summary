by @entity0 for more than three years , @entity1 and @entity2 have been at loggerheads over patent infringements , but the war could soon be coming to an end			1
reports in the @entity8 claim the tech giants have agreed to begin talks to settle such disputes out of court			1
the claims come after a jury awarded both companies damages during a high - profile court battle earlier this month , which made it easier to resume talks			1
@entity1 and @entity2 are reportedly in talks to bring their long - standing patent battle to an end			2
sources ' directly involved in the matter ' said a recent court ruling which said they were both at fault , to varying degrees , made it easier for talks to resume			0
although more time will be needed for the two firms to fix terms regarding royalties the latest case began on 31 march and a jury concluded both firms were at fault to varying degrees			2
in 2010 @entity1 began by suing @entity2 , but the @entity39 firm counter-sued just days later			2
@entity1 then secured an injunction to restrict sales of @entity2 ’s @entity42 in @entity43			0
in july 2012 , @entity1 was told to publicly state @entity2 had n't copied its designs , but in august 2012 @entity1 won $ 1 billion in damages			0
these damages were then dropped from $ 1 billion ( £ 593 million ) to around $ 800 million ( £ 475 million )			0
in june last year , the @entity47 ruled @entity48 infringed on @entity2 patents and should be banned in the @entity50 this ruling was vetoed two months later			0
a retrial began in november that @entity1 won , but @entity2 appealed			0
sources ‘ directly involved in the matter ’ told the @entity8 : ‘ some more time will be needed to fix terms of details such as royalty payments in return for using patents owned by each before reaching a full agreement			0
’ the two tech giants have been battling over patent lawsuits since 2010			1
each company accuses the other of stealing and using hardware and software features from their respective handsets			0
the latest battle was brought by @entity1 and involved at least 10 patent software infringements from the ‘ slide to unlock ’ feature , to face time and video calls			1
the court case began at the end of march , and at the start of this month a @entity79 jury reached a mixed verdict			1
the eight - person jury agreed @entity2 had infringed two @entity1 software patents , awarding the company a total of $ 119.6 million			1
but the jury also found in favour of @entity2 in its counterclaim , awarding the firm $ 158,400 for the infringement of one patent			0
the $ 119.6 million is barely more than five per cent of the $ 2.2 billion in damages @entity1 asked of the court			2
the latest case between the two companies was brought by @entity1 and concerned software infringements , including the ' slide to unlock ' feature , pictured			1
a jury agreed @entity2 infringed two @entity1 patents , and awarded $ 119.6 million , but also found in favour of @entity2 , awarding it $ 158,400 it is also much less than the $ 930 million @entity1 was awarded in 2012 in the same court , the @entity103 , in @entity104			2
the move comes just days after @entity1 and @entity106 bought a similar three - year battle to an end by issuing a statement saying they will be dismissing all patent disputes			1
