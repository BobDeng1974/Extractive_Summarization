a tour guide in the @entity1 has captured the amazing moment a meteor burned up in the atmosphere in a stunning image			1
his long - exposure shot of @entity8 shows the shooting star streaking across the sky			1
and the event is so bright that it casts its light across the water			0
his 30 - second long exposure shot ( shown ) was taken with a @entity21			1
he said that it was just ‘ sheer dumb luck ' that he managed to get the photo the photographer was @entity15 , a tour guide in the @entity1 from @entity17 on the west shore of @entity8 , who runs the website called @entity29			1
mr @entity15 captured the 30 - second long image using a @entity21 compact camera at about 9pm on sunday			1
and he said that it was just ‘ sheer dumb luck ’ that he managed to get the photo			1
an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system			0
most are located between @entity39 and @entity40 in the @entity41			0
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds			0
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			1
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			0
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere			2
if any of this meteoroid makes it to @entity65 , it is called a meteorite			0
@entity67 , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets			0
for example , if @entity65 passes through the detail of a comet , much of the debris burns up in the atmosphere , forming a meteor shower			2
mr @entity15 , 42 , wanted to take pictures of the night to advertise the area for his business			2
the father - of - three , who lives in @entity17 , near @entity82 , said : ‘ i ’ve never seen a shooting star before , i could n’t believe it			1
i quickly checked to see if my camera had picked it up , and it had			0
my wife called it sheer dumb luck			1
‘ i was n’t out looking for it , it was completely unexpected			0
it was a total fluke			0
’ @entity94 , a professional astronomer , told @entity95 that automatic triggering systems can be used to detect the bright motion of a meteor and ‘ start the cameras rolling ’ if others want to attempt to replicate the photo			1
‘ this one is , however , very aesthetically pleasing , ’ he added			0
also of interest are the colours in the water in the photo , which are likely due to the particular scattering of light			0
@entity110 - eyed viewers might notice the colours of the @entity113 flag in the water , very apt considering it is @entity116 tomorrow			0
the was taken near @entity17 on the west shore of @entity8 , shown here			1
mr @entity15 , 42 , wanted to take pictures of the night to advertise the area for his business the meteor was probably the size of a basketball and burned up in the atmosphere before it hit the ground			1
hundreds of meteors enter @entity65 's atmosphere every day ( illustration shown ) a meteor like this is unlikely to very large , but the speed at which they enter the atmosphere produces the amazing shooting star			2
‘ in terms of size , it ’s hard to tell with no scale reference , but a fireball this size could typically come from an object about the size of a baseball to basketball , ’ said mr @entity94			1
hundreds of meteors enter @entity65 ’s atmosphere every day , but very few - if any - make it to the surface as meteorites			2
however , some experts have warned that we need to make more of an effort to track incoming asteroids , as they can cause damage - such as the @entity152 in @entity153 on 15 february 2013 , which seemingly came out of nowhere but injured hundreds when it exploded near the ground .			2

@entity15 captured the image from @entity17
this is on the west coast of @entity8 in @entity19
his 30 - second long exposure shot was taken with a @entity21
he said that it was just ‘ sheer dumb luck ' that he managed to get the photo
the meteor was probably the size of a basketball and burned up in the atmosphere before it hit the ground
