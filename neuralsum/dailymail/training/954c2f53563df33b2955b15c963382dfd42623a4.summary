the elusive ' @entity2 particle ' discovered by scientists in 2012 has the potential to destroy the universe , professor @entity0 has warned			1
at very high energy levels , the @entity12 could cause space and time suddenly collapse - and ' we would n't see it coming ' , the former @entity7 professor of mathematics says			1
the @entity2 particle , which gives shape and size to everything that exists , could cause a ' catastrophic vacuum delay ' if scientists were to put it under extreme stress			1
the theoretical physicist wrote his thoughts on the @entity12 in the preface to a new book , @entity42 , a collection of lectures by scientists and astronomers including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity50 guitarist @entity49			1
prof @entity0 wrote : ' the @entity12 potential has the worrisome feature that it might become megastable at energies above 100bn giga - electron - volts ( @entity55 )			1
' this could mean that the universe could undergo catastrophic vacuum decay , with a bubble of the true vacuum expanding at the speed of light			0
' this could happen at any time and we would n't see it coming			2
' the theoretical physicist wrote his thoughts on the @entity12 in the preface to a new book , @entity42 , which is released in early november this year @entity68 scientist @entity12 predicted the @entity12 in the early 1960s but it was only found in 2012 the higgs boson was a key missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works			1
scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the @entity77 that gave birth to the universe , an invisible energy field , called the @entity12 , formed			1
this has been described as a kind of ‘ cosmic treacle ’ across the universe			0
as particles passed through it , they picked up mass , giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you , everything around you and everything in the universe			0
this was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy @entity98 that has now been confirmed			0
without the @entity12 field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does			2
a boson is a type of sub-atomic particle			2
every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what ’s around it			0
the professor did add sarcastically , however , that such an event is unlikely in the near future			0
he said : ' a particle accelerator that reaches 100bn @entity55 would be larger than @entity115 , and is unlikely to be funded in the present economic climate			0
' professor @entity117 , a theoretical physicist at @entity27 , said : ' one thing should be made clear			0
the discovery of the @entity12 at the @entity120 ( @entity121 ) did not cause this problem , and collisions at the @entity121 could not trigger the instability , because their energies are far too low			0
' particle accelerators make subatomic particles travel at greater and greater speeds as they are pumped with more energy before smashing them together			0
scientists do this to try and spot tiny fragments of particles which fly off , and it is how the @entity12 was discovered at the @entity121 in @entity136 in 2012			2
in that experiment , physicists noticed unexpected debris from the collisions that fitted with what @entity68 scientist @entity12 had predicted in the early 1960s			2
the @entity12 boson particle is thought to be part of the mechanism that gives matter its mass , but scientists do not fully understand it yet			1

the @entity12 ' @entity2 particle ' could destroy the universe , @entity0 says
space and time could suddenly collapse - and ' we would not see it coming '
if scientists put too much energy in the @entity12 boson the universe could *end*
disaster very unlikely as physicists do not have large enough collider
