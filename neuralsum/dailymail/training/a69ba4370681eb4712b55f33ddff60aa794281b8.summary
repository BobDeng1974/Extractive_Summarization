on sunday , @entity0 said that he would definitely get a pick for the @entity2 if he was in captain @entity4 ’s shoes			1
the great ones never lack self - belief , do they ? never mind that @entity0 had just finished with his worst 72 - hole score in a major , taking 24 more shots than he delivered in securing victory at the @entity11 ; he was even five strokes worse than 64 - year - old @entity4			1
perhaps it is as well for @entity14 ’s @entity2 hopes at @entity15 in september that @entity4 the wise is looking for something a little more substantial than blind faith			1
‘ i ’ve said all along i ’ll pick @entity0 if he ’s healthy and playing well			1
he ’s looking like he ’s playing without pain , which is good , but what i was also hoping for from this week was that he would make some money and get in the @entity31			0
how is he doing today ? is he under par ? ’ alas , he was not , as he followed up his triple bogey at the seventh on saturday with a double on his way to a three - over - par 75 , a dismal score on a day when , in @entity4 ’s words , ‘ the course was there for the taking ’			1
@entity4 is desperate for @entity42 to play in the @entity31 is as the four play - off events that make up that competition are the principal tournaments leading up to the @entity2			1
frustrating : woods was expected to perform better at the @entity11 despite recently returning from an injury lay - off @entity48 holds hand up after poor display the top 125 contest the first one and @entity0 is currently outside the top 200			1
his poor finish here will have done little to improve his placing			0
@entity0 now has two events left to clamber up the rankings			1
the good news for @entity4 is that these two events are the @entity57 in 10 days at a @entity59 course where he is a serial winner , followed by the @entity60 over the same venue at @entity62 where he won in 2000			2
asked if he would consider playing in @entity64 if he did n’t make the @entity63 , @entity0 said : ‘ i ’ve still got two events to go and i ’m planning to be there			2
’ disappointing : @entity42 would have hoped to have performed a lot better at the @entity11 @entity4 acknowledged : ‘ it would be up to him if he played in @entity64			2
but it would certainly make it tougher for me to pick him if he is not playing			0
’ the pressure is on in @entity0 ’s next two events			2
‘ i just made way too many mistakes to compete , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ what was it , two triples and three doubles ? but the good news is i got some game time and i am still building and getting stronger all the time			0
it ’s encouraging in terms of getting over the injury but there ’s obviously an awful lot to work on			0
’ not much time , either			0
his next two events will surely decide his @entity2 fate			0
video the open championship : final round			0

@entity4 *reveals* @entity0 could miss out on the @entity14 @entity2 team
64 - year - old *insists* @entity0 is not an automatic choice
@entity14 finished with *hsi* worst 72 - hole score in a major at @entity99
