by @entity0 good mothering really does boost a baby 's brainpower , according to new research			2
scientists found that a mother 's presence can have a positive influence on the neuron generation of her children			1
and they hope to develop diagnostic tools and therapies for people whose brains may have been impaired or simply underdeveloped during infancy			0
researchers from @entity17 studied mothering habits , and they found babies had better neuron generation when in their mother 's presence ( stock image shown ) , which can apparently regulate and control electrical signalling in a positive way that boosts brain development in other infant news , scientists think that cooing at a newborn baby is a vital part of teaching them to speak			1
exaggerated vowels that experts call ‘ motherese ’ - the ‘ goos ’ and ‘ gaas ’ that can be infuriating to non-parents - are a key part of the learning process , a study by the @entity32 suggests			0
exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises , the researchers suggest			0
they found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they can not see the person speaking			2
by the age of 11 months , before they can speak themselves , the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages , the scientists discovered			0
the study serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development			0
and the authors say the long , clear vowels that parents babble at their newborns is a key part of the process			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity69 , are the first to show how such natural , early attachment behaviours including nesting , nursing and grooming impact key stages in postnatal brain development			0
' our research shows how in mammals the mother 's sensory stimulation helps sculpt and mould the infant 's growing brain and helps define the role played by " nurturing " in healthy brain development , and offers overall greater insight into what constitutes good mothering , ' said professor @entity88 of @entity17			1
' the study also helps explain how differences in the way mothers nurture their young could account , in part , for the wide variation in infant behaviour among animals , including people , with similar backgrounds , or in uniform , tightly knit cultures			0
' in the study the researchers observed new - born rats and found as they were protected , warmed and fed their neurons grew and communicated better with each other			1
an analysis of almost 100 hours of video and electrical readings from the pups brains found maternal - infant bonding directly moulds early neural activity			2
the study found the mother 's presence in the nest regulated and controlled electrical signalling in the infant pup 's brain			1
the ' slow wave ' , neural signalling patterns seen during the initial phases of mammalian brain development in rats aged between 12 and 20 days , closely resembled those seen in humans for meditation and sleep - wake cycles and during highly focused attention			1
this suggested that , when the rats were with their mother , their brains were undergoing periods of increased neuron generation			1
when their mother was not present , however , their brain activity was more erratic			1
professor @entity88 's previous research in animals showed how maternal interactions influenced gene activity in the infant brain			2
and this latest study offers an even more profound perspective on maternal caregiving			0
' there are so many factors that go into rearing children , ' added co-author dr @entity151			0
' our findings will help scientists and clinicians better understand the whole brain implications of quality interactions and bonding between mothers and infants so closely after birth , and how these biological attachment behaviours frame the brain 's hard wiring			2
' the study came to the conclusion by observing rats aged 12 to 20 days and studying over 100 hours of video			1
in the presence of their mother they had periods of increased neuron generation ( shown ) , but brain activity became more erratic when they were separated			1
