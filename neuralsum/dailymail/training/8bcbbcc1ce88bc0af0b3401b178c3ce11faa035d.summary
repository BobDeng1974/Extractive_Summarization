by @entity0 published : 02:47 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 05:50 est , 10 january 2014 in the cut - throat battle for @entity4 sales , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 all announced humiliating defeats yesterday			1
@entity5 and @entity6 have been squeezed by a shift in shopping habits as customers desert to budget rivals			1
@entity16 , shares in the two supermarkets were marked down amid warnings that profits will be below expectations			2
the rise of online shopping and a move away from a big weekly shop also played a part , with families choosing to buy little and often online or at convenience stores			0
blow : @entity7 , whose @entity4 ad campaign was fronted by model @entity30 , has revealed a tenth successive quarterly like - for - like sales decline , this time by 2.1 per cent in december @entity7 , like fellow high - end retailer @entity33 , did well on food – but poor sales at its struggling fashion department meant a weak overall result			1
earlier this week @entity38 ’s , the third largest supermarket , admitted it had seen the toughest festive period for 30 years			1
for the first time in at least that long , less food and drink was bought this @entity4 than the year before , industry experts say			2
the disappointing figures heap pressure on all three chains to turn things around in the middle of the cost of living squeeze			0
@entity5 admitted profits will be as much as £ 150million less than forecast , sending its shares down 2 per cent in early trading			1
it is the second year in a row @entity56 ’s biggest supermarket has seen festive takings fall			2
the 2.4 per cent decline came despite a £ 1billion improvement programme			2
chief executive @entity60 said : ‘ clearly @entity4 was disappointing			2
’ website and convenience store sales were up , but they fell in big out - of - town stores			2
‘ consumers are still feeling they do n’t have as much to spend , ’ mr @entity60 said			0
‘ people are shopping more locally , shopping online more			0
’ high end : @entity33 saw sales rise by 4.1 per cent in the 12 days ending on @entity68 -- taking a record £ 51million on december 23 , when an average of 22,000 items were sold every minute @entity5 dropped plans for 100 large @entity73 stores , and is carving up others and using the space for family restaurants , coffee shops , bakeries , gyms and even play areas			1
@entity81 , of consultancy @entity82 , said : ‘ such woeful @entity4 numbers show @entity5 is still stuck in a deep rut			1
‘ its @entity4 was dire			2
and the clearest indication yet that the chain ’s £ 1billion turnaround package is n’t working			0
’ arguably , @entity6 is in an even deeper hole than @entity5 , with festive sales down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago , significantly more than at @entity5			1
the company now says full - year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts , around £ 783million			0
its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘ quite awful ’ by @entity97 @entity98 , an analyst at @entity99			0
the company ’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service			0
chief executive @entity106 said it is working hard to catch up and its first deliveries of online orders will go out today			0
by contrast , @entity112 and @entity113 ’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success			1
the stores offered higher quality food and drink , from aged fillet steaks at £ 5 to award - winning mince pies and fresh turkeys			0
meanwhile at @entity7 fashion sales fell for a tenth consecutive quarter			1
winners : @entity112 and @entity113 are believed to have increased combined sales by about 20 % in the festive quarter the retailer had pinned its hopes on a winter range by new style director @entity130 , the former boss of @entity131			1
it also spent £ 5million on its ‘ leading ladies ’ ad campaign featuring women such as @entity136 and @entity137 in images by photographer @entity139			0
the company blamed a vicious high street price war and an unseasonably warm october as like - for - like fashion sales fell 2.1 per cent year on year for the 13 weeks to december 28			1
chief executive @entity145 said : ‘ anyone who was on the high street could see on the weekend of december 14 to 15 , the whole market was already red [ with sale signs ]			0
’ negative clothing sales were offset by strong food sales , which were up by a total of 4.1 per cent in the three months leading up to @entity4			1
overall , @entity7 figures were not as bad as some analysts feared , and shares rose 3.6 per cent after falling for much of december			1
chancellor @entity154 said disappointing @entity4 figures for some retailers were countered by positive results for @entity158 , @entity33 and @entity159			1
he said : ‘ what that says to me is it ’s very competitive out there in retail , and people know that			0
‘ there ’s also a big change happening in our country with more people shopping online			0
’ @entity33 has a long - standing link with the @entity174 - starred chef @entity173 , who has created a successful range for its stores but how did @entity33 buck the trend ? @entity33 bucked the fall seen at its mainstream rivals thanks to a reputation for quality – and a loyalty card that offers free hot drinks			1
the upmarket retailer has a long - standing link with the @entity174 - starred chef @entity173 , who has created a successful range for its stores			0
this year he developed a number of festive products including gourmet chocolates , a stollen cake flavoured with @entity192 and puff pastry mince pies with pine sugar			0
his reputation for quality and innovation has rubbed off on @entity33 , which reported that sales for the 12 days ending on @entity68 were up by 4.1 per cent on the same period a year before			1
the perks offered by the chain ’s @entity202 loyalty card – a free cup of coffee or tea every day – have also been instrumental in bringing more people through the door			0
the scheme has been controversial as it means that small independent coffee shops are losing trade , while some customers have complained that the free hot drinks attract a lower class of shopper			0
however the chief executive , @entity216 , has been unrepentant , arguing that the immediate benefit is much better than points - based reward systems such as @entity5 ’s clubcard or the @entity38 ’s @entity221			2
high - end food has done well in general this @entity4 , with @entity7 posting strong results for its grocery department			1
@entity33 may also have benefited from its stores being ‘ click and collect ’ sites for the thriving wider @entity158 partnership .			2

@entity7 suffer tenth quarterly drop in clothes and home sales - down 2.1 %
@entity5 sales down 2.4 % and @entity6 slump 5.6 % over festive period
but @entity33 , @entity112 and @entity113 *flourish* after *marvellous* @entity4
shares in @entity5 and @entity6 slump after bad news is revealed
