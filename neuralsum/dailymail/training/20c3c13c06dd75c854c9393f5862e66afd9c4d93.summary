by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 18 february 2013 a father - of - three was shamed into taking drastic action over his weight after humiliating day out with his children at @entity5			1
@entity6 was riding the log flume when his 23 - stone bulk weighed down the ride so heavily that it would n't move in the fast - moving water			1
while his friends could n't help but laugh , @entity6 , 37 , was forced to stand up and shunt the log along the sides of the slide to get to the end of the ride			1
dramatic transformation : after getting stuck on the log flume , @entity6 , 37 , lost an impressive eight stone and while the former engineer tried to laugh too , it a serious wake - up call - if he did n't lose weight fast he would be in serious trouble			1
he said : ' the log just got stuck			0
it was supposed to get rushed along by all the fast - moving water but it just got jammed , largely because of my weight			2
' everyone was watching us and having a giggle and , to hide my embarrassment , i joined in with the joke			0
' but deep down i was mortified , particularly as all my daughters were there			0
sleeping off lunch : before @entity6 lost weight , he 'd happily feast on large portions of fast food ' we had no choice but to push the log along just to get off the ride			1
i could n’t wait to get off			0
' @entity6 , from @entity48 , @entity49 , had been over-eating for years and would think nothing of gorging on a 10 - piece family bucket at @entity52			1
his weight had ballooned as he travelled around the south - east in his job as an engineer			1
' i was in my van a lot and i would just live off snacks from bakeries , @entity59 and my beloved @entity52 , ' he said			1
' i had played a lot of sport - rugby and cricket in particular - but gradually i became more susceptible to injuries as my weight shot up			2
' in the end , the only trousers i had in my wardrobe were jogging bottoms - because i knew the waists would stretch			2
' i had a 48 - inch waist and i knew that if i did n't lose weight and radically change my lifestyle i was going to run into serious health problems			2
' the scene of the crime : @entity6 and his friends ride the log flume where he later got stuck after getting wedged , @entity6 realised it was time to do something about his 48 - inch waist @entity6 started exercising again regularly - swimming a mile at a time because a session in the pool put less strain on his joints than other sports			1
and he began to count every calorie he ate using an app on his phone			0
' i relished my new lifestyle			0
i started making my own bread - instead of using sugar i would use sweetener			2
' a typical slice of bread has more than 120 calories - mine had around 55			2
the weight began to fall off me			0
' he also took @entity100 diet pills - first made popular by @entity101 and @entity102			1
they are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising			2
@entity6 said : ' i work as engineer - i like to know how things work			1
i took the same attitude to my weight loss - looking at all the factors which had caused my weight to balloon			2
' i knew that i needed to change my diet and start a regular regime of exercise			0
then and now : thanks to ditching his beloved fast food and a new fitness regime the weight fell off @entity6 ' the diet pills were also a really important step			1
they worked for me in the same way patches work for a smoker who is looking to give up			0
' they gave me that extra impetus @entity131 helped me to stop wanting food			0
' some people say that using diet pills is cheating			0
' they do n't just work on their own : you need to combine them with a good diet and regular exercise ' i soon found that i was full up eating half what i had done before			0
he lost three stone in the first three months and has shed eight stone since that fateful day at @entity5			1
his weight has gone down from 23 stone to under 15 stone and he has around two stone to go reach what he feels will be his ideal weight			1
@entity6 's weight loss has helped him transformed his life and allowed him to cuddle his daughters again for the first time in years			1
he said : ' they tell me now , " @entity155 , we can get our arms around you again			0
" ' they are looking forward to going back to @entity5 this summer			0
' i ’ll go straight back to the log flume , ' he explained			0
' and this time i wo n’t get stuck			0

@entity6 , 37 , thought nothing of *scoffing* 10 - piece family bucket at @entity52
went from 23 stone to under 15 stone after humiliating family day out
engineer *credits* exercise , *slimming* pills and ditching junk food for *success*
