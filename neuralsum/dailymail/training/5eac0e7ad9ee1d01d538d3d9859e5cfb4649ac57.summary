more than 400 war heroes , army generals and rank - and - file soldiers have issued a plea to @entity5 voters warning that independence would leave @entity8 's defences ‘ irresponsibly weakened ’			1
the former servicemen and women - who are all eligible to vote - have signed a statement entitled ‘ we are stronger when we stand together ’ urging @entity5 to vote against separation on thursday			1
the signatories boast a who ’s who of @entity5 ’s military history over the last seventy years , including six former heads of the @entity17 in @entity5 and the two @entity19 veterans who helped sink the @entity20 and its sister ship the @entity23 - lt cdr @entity22 and lt cdr @entity24			1
in the statement , the veterans warn voters that the only way to safeguard @entity5 ’s interests in the future is to vote against independence			1
‘ we are in no doubt that were @entity5 to break away from the @entity8 the current arrangements for defending all these islands would be irresponsibly weakened			1
’ ‘ we recognise that when deciding which way to vote we will all be influenced by many different factors			0
however in defence terms there is no question about it			0
we are a great deal better together			0
’ the statement also expressed concern over the @entity55 ’s plans to set up a separate @entity56 with a budget of just £ 2.5billion a year			0
plans : @entity59 says that an independent @entity5 would set up a £ 2.5billion @entity5 @entity56 ‘ we see no evidence that the @entity55 ’s proposals for the defence and security of an independent @entity5 could possibly provide us with a credible , effective defence force capable of securing the interests of @entity5 and our people			2
‘ @entity8 ’s armed forces represent a potent safeguard against those who mean us harm			2
’ it adds that @entity5 stands to lose thousands of highly - skilled and high - value jobs in the wider defence industry , while @entity8 ’s military would continue to offer ‘ challenging and rewarding careers ’ for many @entity5 if the union remains intact			1
‘ we are very proud of the remarkable contribution that @entity5 men and women have made to the @entity80 and the important and integral part we have played in preserving our nation ’s freedom and safeguarding our interests			2
’ heritage : the @entity85 , one of the best - known @entity5 battalions , while deployed in @entity87 in 2004 one signatory , captain @entity89 of the @entity90 , who left the army in 2010 after 27 years , added : ‘ i have very strong emotional ties to the union			0
it would absolutely break my heart to see the @entity5 element of the @entity97 flag unpicked and separated from it when i ’ve fought together with my @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity102 comrades			0
’ @entity103 , leader of the @entity104 , added : ‘ in no area is the case for our @entity8 better made than in defence			0
why , on this small island , would we split up the defences that have kept us safe for centuries ? ’ ‘ we are stronger and safer together			0
these veterans know it and will be voting to keep @entity5 secure as part of the @entity8 on thursday			1
