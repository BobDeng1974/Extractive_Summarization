businessman prince @entity10 became embroiled in a dispute with @entity12 after selling an airliner to former @entity15 dictator colonel @entity14			1
consultant mrs @entity12 helped broker the deal and sued the wealthy owner of the @entity18 in @entity19 claiming he owed her about £ 6.5million commission for the part she played			0
unsatisfactory : a judge branded prince @entity10 's evidence ' confusing and unreliable '			1
right , consultant @entity12 , who is owed £ 6.5million by the prince following her successful claim although the prince disagreed , judge mr justice @entity28 today ruled against him			0
mrs @entity12 had said prince @entity10 agreed to pay the commission in 2005 following a meeting in @entity14 's tent in @entity15			1
prince @entity10 had disputed her claim , at a trial in @entity19 earlier this summer , and denied that any agreement was made for a ' specific commission '			1
legal dispute : prince @entity10 arriving at the @entity5 earlier today flanked by his legal team judge @entity28 said the dispute turned on whose evidence he accepted and that he had ' overwhelmingly concluded ' that he preferred mrs @entity12 's case			1
he said : ' at the end of the day i simply found his ( prince @entity10 ) evidence confusing and too unreliable and mrs @entity12 's was more credible on any dispute of fact between them			1
' having seen the prince in the witness box and the evidence he gave , i found his evidence completely unsatisfactory			2
' his memory had clearly gone as regards the detail of any of these transactions			0
his attempts to bolster that defect in the witness box were frankly pathetic and he demonstrated great amounts of confusion			2
' judge @entity28 added : ' it is not necessary for me to determine that he was telling lies in the witness box			2
he came close to admitting it			0
' mr justice @entity28 pointed out the prince was one of the richest men on the planet			0
' the front cover of his autobiography published in 2005 refers to his being the fifth richest man in the world , ' added @entity72			0
' he has an estimated fortune of over $ 20billion with extensive and substantial business interests throughout the world			0
' after the ruling , mrs @entity12 said that she was relieved at the outcome			0
she added : ' today 's decision has reinforced my belief in the fairness and impartiality of the @entity84 courts			0
' the prince now plans to appeal			0
a spokesman said : ' the court has not undertaken a balanced assessment of all the evidence and has been unduly swayed by the judge 's own view regarding prince @entity10 's business negotiations with the government of col @entity14 to secure full payment for his aircraft after @entity14 had reneged on agreements with him			1
' @entity10 believes today 's ruling is wrong and is not an accurate analysis of all of the evidence before the court			1
' reneged : prince @entity10 claimed the former @entity15 dictator col @entity14 had failed to stick to a business agreement between them upper class : prince @entity10 owns the @entity18 in @entity19 , a retreat favoured by only the very wealthiest of people			1

@entity108 's ' fifth richest ' man *reprimanded* by judge over @entity14 airliner deal
prince @entity10 's witness box efforts branded ' pathetic ' at @entity5
deal broker said she was ' relieved ' at the outcome of the hearing
