@entity5 , 33 , was so stressed by the ordeal he developed shingles and was told to avoid his fiance for a month , leaving his big day in doubt			1
he was driving along a country lane with fiancee @entity11 when the gang jumped out of the bushes and blocked his path			0
brandishing baseball bats and setting off stun grenades , they told him to ' get out of the f * * * * * * car , get on the floor ! ' and bundled him into the back of a van			1
he was bound , gagged and dressed in a @entity24 - style jumpsuit			1
clair - who was in on the gag - pretended to be terrified as @entity5 was driven off in fear of his life			1
@entity5 was then handed a rusty bike and map and ordered to cycle ten miles before reaching the venue for his stag party - an outdoor activity ' boot camp ' centre			1
but the stress of the prank left @entity5 suffering shingles - an illness often found in combat veterans			1
@entity5 , of @entity59 , @entity60 , was so contagious he could n't go near @entity61 for a month in the run up to the wedding			1
luckily he recovered in time and the pair tied the knot last saturday in front of 130 guests			0
smoke alarm : @entity5 was driving along a country lane with his wife - to - be @entity11 when they were intercepted by the gang rough treatment : he was then bundled into the back of a van before being bound , gagged and dressed him in a @entity24 - style jumpsuit stitched up : @entity79 ( left ) in his orange jumpsuit and ( right ) on his bike in a lime green mankini which he given after being dumped at the side of the road and told to cycle ten miles to his stag do @entity5 said : ' i was absolutely terrified			1
we were stuck behind this van that had ' @entity91 bailiff ' printed on the back			2
' then all of a sudden , all these men dressed in black balaclavas burst out of the bushes and dragged me out of the car			2
' they put me in handcuffs , slapped me around a bit and threw me into the back of the van			0
' i have never been so scared in my entire life - i did n't know what was going to happen			0
i was petrified with fear			0
' for more than two hours i was in that van - i had no idea what was going on , or where they were taking me			2
' when i got the diagnosis my heart sank			0
they told me i would have to stay away from @entity110 until i got better and i was really worried i would miss the big day			2
' the gang struck on a country lane outside @entity59 as @entity5 headed out on what he thought was a day trip with @entity110			1
wicked wife - to - be : fiance @entity11 , who was in on the joke , pretended to be terrified but is later seen laughing as her fiance is driven away elaborate : the gang , pictured driving their friend on a 100 - mile journey , wore ski masks and balaclavas it was the week before the planned date of his stag do - but unbeknown to him his stags had brought the date forward			1
the prank was planned with military - style precision - including codenames and a 14 - page plan for the ' elite strike team ' on how to apprehend the ' target '			1
called ' @entity137 ' , the plan detailed a ' non-elite strike team to intercept and kidnap the subject and deliver safely to rendezvous point '			0
the plan said : ' @entity141 are to remain on for maximum effect and ' fear factor ' ' @entity144 and other non- ' pro ' equipment is to remain hidden in bags until the subject has been removed from his vehicle			0
' once subject is secured , he is to be dressed in an orange jumpsuit , restrained with handcuffs and ' bagged			2
' subject will then be transported to @entity156 rv point			0
' @entity5 quivered in the back of the van for nearly two hours before his pals finally revealed it was a joke			1
prepared : one of the planning documents produced by the gang showing the proposed point of contact organised : another document detailing the code names and roles of members of the gang but he then had to endure the humiliation of riding a bike into @entity172 , @entity44 , on a busy @entity173 weekend			0
he added : ' by the time i had worked out they were my friends , i still had to get into that ridiculous costume and cycle along busy roads on a bike that was barely fit for purpose			1
' i 've cycled to @entity182 and from @entity183 to @entity184 , but that was by far the most difficult ride of my life - i was still shaking so much			0
' a week after the do @entity5 began feeling sore and itchy - and was diagnosed with shingles , a skin and nerve disease commonly seen in combat veterans and brought on by stress			1
he said : ' i have no doubt that fake kidnapping caused me to develop shingles			0
' i 'm usually such a calm and placid guy - but the stress of that ordeal was so much i thought i was going to have a heart attack			1
' the shingles was excruciating - @entity110 never had chicken pox as a child , so i 've been quarantined from her for most of the last month because i was so contagious			2
' we had to sleep in separate bedrooms			0
' happy ending ! @entity5 developed shingles due to stress and feared he would miss his wedding a dish best served cold : the marketing consultant still invited his friends , but has vowed to seek ' vengeance ' all 's well that ends well : mr @entity5 and his bride @entity11 on their wedding day but big - hearted @entity5 still invited his pals to the wedding , despite their prank causing his illness - which is a debilitating form of the chicken pox virus			1
he said : ' it would have been hilarious if the joke was on anybody else apart from me			0
i 've not forgiven my friends , i 've just logged it for future vengeance			2
' a few of them have their own weddings coming up , so i 'm going to have to come up with something spectacular			0
' i 've got a really close group of friends who are always playing pranks on each other - i 've dressed a mate up in a bondage suit and tied him to a lamppost in the middle of @entity241 before			2
' one of the organisers , electrician @entity243 , said : ' a lot of time and planning went into this			0
' @entity5 is a great guy , but we wanted to get him back for all the pranks he 's pulled on us over the years			2
' it was hilarious - he was so terrified he was about to shake out of his skin			0
we did n't mean to give him shingles , but it was worth it			0

@entity5 feared he would miss wedding after stress gave him shingles
ambushed with smoke grenades and bats and told to ' get on the floor ! '
