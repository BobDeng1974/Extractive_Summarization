by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 05:39 est , 25 july 2013 the world is facing an ' economic time bomb ' because of methane gases being produced by shrinking sea levels in the @entity6 , researchers claim			1
there is a large amount of methane stored in the region around the @entity11 and if it was suddenly released into the atmosphere it could change the @entity14 's climate causing extreme weather , flooding and drought			1
by using economic modelling , scientists from @entity19 and @entity20 discovered that if the @entity6 ice levels continue to shrink at their current rate it could produce enough methane to cause global climate change damage of £ 40 trillion - the same size of the world economy in 2012			1
scientists from @entity19 and @entity20 have discovered that shrinking @entity6 ice levels could produce enough methane to cause global climate change damage of £ 40 trillion			1
methane released into the atmosphere could change the @entity14 's climate causing extreme weather , flooding and drought the groundbreaking claims were made by @entity35 from @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 in @entity39 at @entity40 , @entity19 , and @entity41 , professor of ocean physics at the @entity19			2
they calculated - using an economic computer program called @entity45 - that the thaw would release 50 gigatonnes of methane into the air			2
if other factors , such as ocean acidification are included , the cost would be much higher			0
around 80 per cent of these costs caused by the damage will directly affect developing countries as they experience more extreme weather , flooding , droughts and poorer health as @entity6 warming affects climate			2
it is said to be the first time researchers have calculated the potential economic impact of methane from the @entity11 being released into the air as a result of the thaw			1
the researchers used an economic computer program called @entity45 to calculate that the thaw of @entity6 ice , pictured , would release 50 gigatonnes of methane into the air certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping			2
some gases remain in the atmosphere and do n't react physically or chemically to changes in temperature			0
these gases , including carbon dioxide and methane , are described as ' forcing ' climate change and contribute to the greenhouse effect and include : carbon dioxide is a small but important part of the atmosphere			1
it is released through natural processes including volcanic eruptions as well human actions such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels			0
methane is a hydrocarbon gas produced through natural sources , such as the shrinking ice levels in the @entity6 , as well as human actions including waste in landfills , agriculture and rice cultivation			1
methane is considered a more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide			0
if a large amount of methane was suddenly released into the air , it could bring the date at which the global average temperature rise exceeds 2 degrees @entity111 by between 15 and 35 years			2
although this constitutes just a fraction of the vast reservoirs of methane in the @entity6 , scientists believe that the release of even a small proportion of these reserves could trigger possibly catastrophic climate change			1
' the global impact of a warming @entity6 is an economic time - bomb , ' said @entity35			0
@entity41 added : ' the imminent disappearance of the summer sea ice in the @entity6 will have enormous implications for both the acceleration of climate change , and the release of methane from off - shore waters which are now able to warm up in the summer			1
' this massive methane boost will have major implications for global economies and societies			0
' most discussions about a warming @entity6 focus on increased oil - and - gas drilling and the opening up of new shipping routes that attract investments of hundreds of billions of dollars			0
the researchers added these economic discussions are missing the big picture on @entity6 change and call for the @entity145 to invest in the further modelling needed to assess the true costs			0
they also want to encourage world leaders to ' consider the economic time - bomb beyond short - term gains from shipping and extraction			0
' the claims also suggest that the methane released by the shrinking levels would bring forward the date at which the global average temperature rise exceeds two degrees @entity111 by between 15 and 35 years			0
dr @entity37 , of @entity19 , added : ' in the absence of climate - change mitigation measures the model calculates it would increase mean global climate impacts by $ 60 trillion			1

shrinking ice in the @entity11 releases methane gas into the air
amount of gas produced could cause catastrophic climate change damage
economists believe this damage will cost us £ 40 trillion - the same size of the world economy in 2012
