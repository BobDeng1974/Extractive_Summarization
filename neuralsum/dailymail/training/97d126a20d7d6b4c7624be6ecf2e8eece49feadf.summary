a rocky lookout with niches for lanterns and a subterranean cave complete with a secret waterway entrance have shed more light on the life of 17th century pirates			1
the two locations in the @entity8 are believed to have been used by a group of 17th century pirates and smugglers , but remain unexcavated , with possible treasure thought to rest nearby			1
historians believe the secret spots could have been used by a powerful alliance that was destroyed in a huge battle in 1614 when it was at the height of its power			1
archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates , one of which is located at a place known today as ' @entity27 's @entity26 ' , east of @entity28 in county @entity29			1
the location has niches for candles or lanterns ( pictured ) that would have been used to signal to pirates in the darkness the area was dominated by @entity38 pirates in the 17th century because there was a crackdown on pirates in southern @entity38 by @entity42 private sailors who made a living fighting the @entity45 moved to @entity46 to make a living once peace was declared			1
@entity46 at the time was a @entity51 colonisation experiment			0
the local economy was buoyed by loot stolen by pirates who largely escaped the law because of @entity46 ’s location and cooperation by local officials , ms @entity52 explained			2
pirates typically paid three times the price for local goods in return for smuggling their loot ashore without any problems , so that local business people grew rich			2
the practice even helped to fund exploration and colonisation projects in the @entity72 , such as @entity73 in @entity74			0
ms @entity52 said : ‘ legitimate businessmen and merchant venturers were deeply involved , as it was assured access to venture capital , that was , in turn , invested in colonial ventures elsewhere in the @entity82 , which was opening up to the maritime empires globally at this point in time			2
’ the alliance that operated off the southwest coast of @entity46 at the time was wealthy and elected its own admiral , but was ultimately destroyed by a @entity27 fleet , according to historians			1

the site has niches for candles or lanterns that would have been used to signal to pirates in the darkness			0
while it might not have been used in the 17th century , underwater archaeologist @entity52 , who discovered the site , told @entity105 that it would have been ‘ used over a very long period by pirates , smugglers and others who wanted to do secret things ’			1
another site nearby called @entity112 led to a subterranean cavern that could be accessed by a boat via a small waterway – ideal for unloading stolen booty			0
both the sites are unexcavated and were found by ms @entity52 , who works for the @entity119 's underwater archaeology unit			0

it is possible to see concealed steps in this photograph an expert in 17th century pirates , she said : ‘ one pirate haul is said to have been worth , in today 's money , some $ 7 million			1
this was an amazingly lucrative commercial venture , and this is why it was so successful			0
’ the pirate alliance in @entity46 was largely made up of @entity148 as well as @entity8 , @entity149 and ‘ renegade ’ @entity150 , according to records			1
ms @entity52 said they show that @entity153 , who was lieutenant to pirate captain @entity154 , was the only black man to have held a position of command in the motley crew			0
she plans to search @entity158 , close to @entity112 , for the remains of the destroyed alliance fleet and there is the prospect of finding treasure there , according to a list describing the loot on - board one of the ships			0
‘ certainly part of the lower hulls and its cargoes could be there - things that were in the hold of the ships , ’ she said			0
‘ similarly , if a ship exploded , then material could be scattered , and we could be dealing with a wider archaeological site			0
’ while it would be difficult to tell if any ships did indeed belong to pirates , if they were found and identified , the ships would be the first pirate - associated wreck found in @entity8 waters			2
archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates , one of which is located at a place known today as ' @entity192 ' near @entity28 ( pictured )			1
another hidden subterranean waterway was discovered near @entity158 ( also marked )			0

historians believe 17th century pirates could have used secret spots in southern @entity8 to unload loot
two sites were discovered , one of which is located at a place known today as ‘ @entity27 ’s @entity26 , ’ east of @entity28 in county @entity29
piracy at the time was a lucrative venture and it is thought some treasure might still be lost at sea nearby
