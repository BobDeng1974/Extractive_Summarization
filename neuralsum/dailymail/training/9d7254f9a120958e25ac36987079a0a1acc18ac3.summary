born out of the @entity2 in 2003 , @entity1 's deadly grip has stretched across the @entity3 and into northern - @entity4 where today , only the @entity5 separates the militants from @entity7			1
it has conquered regions of @entity10 , @entity11 and recently @entity12 while building a terrifying support structure in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
and this tyrannical expansion is all part of its ' global strategy ' to seize control of destablised countries while ' engaging in all - out battle against the @entity28 , ' @entity29 told @entity30			1
counter-terrorism analyst @entity31 said : ' what we 've started to see is @entity34 has begun to accelerate its operation to activate these sleeper groups that its reaching out to and it 's having international effects			1
' the vastness of its influence went largely unnoticed among the wider public until sunday when it released a gruesome video showing the beheadings of 21 @entity18 christians on a @entity12 beach			2
growth of terror : since its formation as the @entity34 in 2013 - it has conquered regions of @entity10 , @entity11 and recently @entity12 - while building support among marginalised @entity52 in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 the strength of @entity34 ' control went largely unnoticed until footage of 21 @entity18 christians being beheaded on a beach in @entity12 ( pictured ) emerged control : supporters brazenly show their support for @entity1 in their @entity10 stronghold of @entity61 ( pictured ) , which the government is now trying to take back expansion : as the @entity28 's gaze was transfixed on @entity1 's brutal acts of terror in @entity10 and @entity11 , it was gaining support from marginalised @entity52 as far as @entity68 ( pictured ) on the @entity70 - @entity19 border the country 's proximity to @entity7 and its role as a ' hub ' for radicalism now poses a ' disaster scenario ' according to @entity3 and @entity4 legal consultants @entity77			1
its chief executive @entity79 told @entity30 : ' there is real concern that dynamics in @entity12 could destabilise neighboring states like @entity21 which , like @entity18 , has had a long and particularly violent battle with extremism			2
' radicals from neighboring countries have been using @entity12 as a refuge and a base for operations against their home countries			1
' @entity34 commands 31,500 loyal fighters according to the @entity94 but a commander of the @entity97 fighters who battled the extremists told the @entity99 on sunday that they number closer to 200,000			1
its growth in power and territory has been staggering since 2004 when it was known as @entity34 ( @entity34 )			1
the group played a prominent role in the violent insurgency against the @entity106 and @entity108 occupation of @entity10 after toppling @entity110 's rule in 2003			0
after a string of bombings and murders over the next two years , its membership grew to around 1,000 according to the @entity115			0
@entity34 then merged with its @entity117 allies in october 2006 to form the @entity34 ( @entity34 )			2
during the @entity2 which took place between 2006 and 2008 , @entity34 had strongholds in @entity61 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 and commanded between 1,000 and 2,500 soldiers by late 2012			1
when it expanded into @entity11 in april 2013 , it finally transformed into the @entity34 in @entity11 ( @entity34 ) as it exists today			2
@entity1 has now self - proclaimed the @entity11 city of @entity125 as its capital , although there have been reports of increased defections			0
new ground : its presence in @entity12 went largely unnoticed - but footage emerged of terrorist group @entity134 parading a fleet of @entity136 in @entity137 while carrying @entity1 flags @entity7 's doorstep : @entity1 has now gained control of a number of @entity12 coastal towns including @entity137 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 it was once a rebel group defying the @entity108 and @entity106 occupation of @entity10			1
now other extremists across the @entity3 and northern - @entity4 are pledging allegiance to it			1
' @entity34 has name brand power , ' @entity31 says			0
' what we 've seen in a few different places is @entity34 ability to transfer new military expertise , explosives planning , new planning to other groups to win over their allegiance and we 're seeing that in @entity12			1
' terrorist organisations inside the country such as @entity134 - which has taken control of @entity137 and declared its own @entity34 state - also announced its alliance with @entity34 in 2014			1
while @entity15 - based militant group @entity166 ( @entity166 ) - one of @entity34 's most powerful branches - defected to @entity34 this month according to @entity106 monitoring group site			0
and while it has no confirmed territory in @entity20 , the country has become a breeding ground for @entity34 fighters with the @entity173 claiming 2,400 citizens had become combatants since 2011			1
@entity34 does control regions in the north and west of @entity10 , including @entity179 near the capital @entity120 and its second largest city @entity61			1
it continued presence in @entity10 has forced the @entity28 into action , with the @entity106 announcing it will train as many as 25,000 @entity10 soldiers to retake it			0
fighters in @entity186 , northern - @entity10 were able to successfully expel the insurgents from its village last month with the aid of @entity191 air strikes			0
but @entity196 aggression only fuels @entity1 's propaganda , counter-terrorism think tank @entity197 has said			2
fightback : the majority of @entity34 ' territory lies inside @entity10 and @entity11 but there have been recent reports of defections in @entity11 , while @entity10 plan to retake its second city of @entity61 from the @entity206 researcher @entity207 told @entity30 : ' one of the mainstays of is ideology is provocation			0
so air strikes by the @entity191 were always going to be interpreted as air strikes by the crusaders			0
' what better propaganda can you use to convince people there is a conspiracy against the @entity221 world than showing horrible images of children who have been killed in air strikes ? ' ' their ability to menace and intimidate the rest of the world is all based on propaganda			0
if you took away their propaganda , they would not look nearly as dangerous			0
' in @entity18 's @entity17 region , which became the centre of a violent insurgency after @entity236 was overthrown , the @entity232 militant group has pledged its support to @entity34			0
as did @entity21 - based miltants @entity239 - or soldiers of the @entity241 - who swore their loyalty to @entity34 after kidnapping and beheading a @entity244 citizen in september			2
earlier this year , @entity246 slogans and graffiti even began to appear on walls in @entity249 , @entity70			0
local @entity252 groups there have considered joining @entity34 after becoming frustrated by the army 's almost total control in the region , the @entity250 has reported			1
propaganda : experts say @entity1 's brutal execution videos are designed to entice the @entity28 into a war , while more ' inane ' videos are planned to build support among ' marginalised @entity52 ' exaggerated presence : counter-terrorism experts also believe the group uses effective and carefully produced propaganda videos to amplify ' the exact amount of power it has in a region ' extremism : islamist groups in @entity18 , @entity272 , @entity12 and even the @entity273 have pledged their support to @entity1 although it controls no territory in the country , the @entity275 says it has declared an interest in the country and its neighbour @entity19 - where it has reportedly sent envoys to recruit			1
@entity272 's @entity282 publicly declared its support for the @entity285 extremists just one month after it established a worldwide @entity34 caliphate in june 2014			0
there have even been reports of guerrilla units taking its brand of brutal militancy to the @entity273 , where its spokesperson said : ' we have an alliance with the @entity1 and @entity296			0
' experts say the group 's recent surge in military support is down to obscure propaganda videos showing the militants fixing roads and planting flowers which are ' enticing ' to @entity206 excited about the idea of a global caliphate			2
it also uses effective and carefully produced propaganda videos which could ' exaggerate the exact amount of power it has in a region ' .			0

@entity34 began as @entity34 in 2004 and militants had just 1,000 soldiers , but it has grown to more than *30,000*
reach of @entity34 now spans @entity3 and northern @entity4 , with only the @entity5 separating from @entity7
terrorist groups around the world now pledging allegiance to @entity1 as groups seize destabilised countries
experts say @entity34 ' control in @entity12 could create *potential* ' disaster scenario ' and coalition *airstrikes* are fueling the militants ' *manipulative* propaganda
@entity34 has 31,500 loyal fighters according to @entity94 but estimates place this far *higher* at around 200,000 militants
