the top half of the @entity2 table shows just how close the race for a place in the top four is the race for the @entity7 is shaping up to be the most tense in years			1
with @entity9 and @entity10 in a two - way fight for the @entity2 title , five teams are battling it out for the remaining two spots in the coveted top four			2
just three points separate @entity17 in third spot and @entity19 in seventh , with @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 jostling in between			1
the riches of @entity25 's elite competition await the lucky two clubs who claim their places in the top four			2
with just over a third of the season to go , @entity30 analyses the contenders ' strengths and weaknesses ... but who do you think will win the race ? @entity17 reasons they will make the top four their mean defence			1
the @entity17 have conceded just 17 @entity2 goals this season - the best defensive record in the top flight			1
@entity46 has got his back - four , led by skipper @entity47 , well drilled			2
if they score , the likelihood is that @entity17 leave with the points			1
reasons they wo n’t make the top four the lack of experience			2
@entity46 has assembled a young and vibrant squad down at @entity55 's			0
but when it comes to the crunch do they have the knowhow and mettle to go the distance ? we do n't know the answer because we 've not seen them in this position			0
but we 're about to find out			0
despite failing to keep this @entity67 effort out , @entity47 has marshalled the league 's best defence remaining fixtures ( top four challengers in bold ) @entity17 vs @entity72 - wed 11 feb , 7.45pm @entity17 vs @entity73 22 feb , 4.15pm @entity74 vs @entity17 - sat 28 feb , 3pm @entity17 vs @entity75 - tue 3 mar , 7.45pm @entity9 vs @entity76 15 mar , 1.30pm @entity17 vs @entity77 - sat 21 mar , 3pm @entity78 vs @entity17 - sat 4 apr , 3pm @entity17 vs @entity79 - sat 11 apr , 3pm @entity80 vs @entity17 - sat 18 apr , 3pm @entity17 vs @entity22 - sat 25 apr , 3pm @entity81 vs @entity17 - sat 2 may , 3pm @entity82 vs @entity17 - sat 9 may , 3pm @entity17 vs @entity83 - sat 16 may , 3pm @entity10 vs @entity76 24 may , 3pm @entity85 's goals have fired @entity17 deep into the race for a @entity7 slot @entity20 reasons they will make the top four they 've been there , seen it , done it , got all the memorabilia			1
@entity97 's side are masters at timing their run perfectly to ensure they finish in the top four			2
so many times we 've questioned their @entity7 qualification credentials			2
they 've not buckled , yet ... reasons they wo n’t make the top four their injuries			0
with a fully - fit squad at his disposal , @entity97 has a team to challenge @entity109 and @entity25 's best			0
but his season has been beset by injuries to key men			0
and with doubts now over @entity114 and @entity115 following the win over @entity82 , could this be the year they miss out ? @entity97 may have shot himself in the foot by rushing @entity114 back from injury too quickly remaining fixtures ( top four challengers in bold ) @entity75 vs @entity20 - sat 21 feb , 3pm @entity20 vs @entity122 1 mar , 2.05pm @entity123 vs @entity20 - wed 4 mar , 7.45pm @entity20 vs @entity72 - sat 14 mar , 3pm @entity124 vs @entity20 - sat 21 mar , 3pm @entity20 vs @entity19 - sat 4 apr , 3pm @entity77 vs @entity20 - sat 11 apr , 3pm @entity20 vs @entity81 - sat 18 apr , 3pm @entity20 vs @entity9 - sat 25 apr , 3pm @entity79 vs @entity20 - sat 2 may , 3pm @entity20 vs @entity125 - sat 9 may , 3pm @entity21 vs @entity20 - sat 16 may , 3pm @entity20 vs @entity126 24 may , 3pm @entity128 hs returned to help @entity20 surge towards yet another top - four finish @entity21 reasons they will make the top four their firepower			1
admittedly , it has n't clicked for @entity136 in the attacking third - but if it does they 'll walk into the top four			2
@entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
is there a better forward line in the continent ? reasons they wo n’t make the top four their inconsistencies			0
it 's been a stop - start season for @entity21			1
just when you think they 're are on a run , they falter			0
it 's been a transitional season for @entity157 , an injury - hit one at that , but if they continue to stop - start then they could be facing a second successive season out of @entity25 's elite club competition			0
there are still bi question marks over @entity21 's team , such as where @entity141 should play remaining fixtures ( top four challengers in bold ) @entity21 vs @entity77 - wed 11 feb , 7.45pm @entity125 vs @entity21 - sat 21 feb , 3pm @entity21 vs @entity81 - sat 28 feb , 3pm @entity124 vs @entity21 - wed 4 mar , 7.45pm @entity21 vs @entity169 15 mar , 4pm @entity19 vs @entity170 , 1.30pm @entity21 vs @entity83 - sat 4 apr , 3pm @entity21 vs @entity171 , 3pm @entity9 vs @entity21 - sat 18 apr , 3pm @entity78 vs @entity21 - sat 25 apr , 3pm @entity21 vs @entity74 - sat 2 may , 3pm @entity75 vs @entity21 - sat 9 may , 3pm @entity21 vs @entity20 - sat 16 may , 3pm @entity79 vs @entity170 24 may , 3pm the sight of @entity143 celebrating a goal has been all too rare for @entity21 fans during a difficult season @entity22 reasons they will make the top four the striker the supporters call ' one of their own '			1
in short , @entity182 has been a revelation for @entity22 this season			1
goal after goal after goal			0
it 's 23 for the season and surely an @entity109 debut is on the horizon for the striker			0
if he stays in top form , @entity22 can make a real fist of making the top - four			1
reasons they wo n’t make the top four their leaky defence			0
@entity197 has struggled to find a settled back four this season and it shows			0
spurs have conceded 34 league goals so far this season - only five clubs in the @entity2 have shipped more			0
@entity197 must find a solution or @entity22 will miss out again			2
the inspirational @entity182 ( left ) scored his 23rd goal of the season for @entity22 at @entity19 remaining fixtures ( top four challengers in bold ) @entity22 vs @entity208 22 feb , 12pm @entity22 vs @entity125 - wed 4 mar , 7.45pm @entity123 vs @entity22 - sat 7 mar , 3pm @entity21 vs @entity169 15 mar , 4pm @entity22 vs @entity82 - sat 21 mar , 3pm @entity77 vs @entity22 - sat 4 apr , 3pm @entity22 vs @entity83 - sat 11 apr , 3pm @entity124 vs @entity22 - sat 18 apr , 3pm @entity17 vs @entity22 - sat 25 apr , 3pm @entity22 vs @entity10 - sat 2 may , 3pm @entity80 vs @entity22 - sat 9 may , 3pm @entity22 vs @entity79 - sat 16 may , 3pm @entity78 vs @entity169 24 may , 3pm @entity209 , pictured ( left ) unable to stop a rampaging @entity211 , is part of a poor @entity22 back line @entity19 reasons they will make the top four momentum			1
@entity19 have got the wind in their sails at the moment ; reminiscent of last season 's blistering finish to the season that saw them just miss out on the title			1
with @entity226 back fit and @entity227 fully - charged after his winter break to @entity229 , the @entity225 are on a roll			1
reasons they wo n’t make the top four their poor start to the season means @entity19 must have a virtually faultless end to the season in order to break into the @entity7 places			1
even with their momentum , you fear they 've left themselves too much to do			0
and with their @entity243 run - could they take their eyes off the prize ? @entity226 's return from injury could be the spark @entity19 need to make the top four remaining fixtures ( top four challengers in bold ) @entity17 vs @entity73 22 feb , 4.15pm @entity19 vs @entity251 1 mar , 12pm @entity19 vs @entity77 - wed 4 mar , 8pm @entity125 vs @entity19 - mon 16 mar , 8pm @entity19 vs @entity252 , 1.30pm @entity20 vs @entity19 - sat 4 apr , 3pm @entity19 vs @entity124 - sat 11 apr , 3pm @entity79 vs @entity19 - @entity253 , 3pm @entity74 vs @entity19 - sat 25 apr , 3pm @entity19 vs @entity123 - sat 2 may , 3pm @entity9 vs @entity19 - sat 9 may , 3pm @entity19 vs @entity75 - sat 16 may , 3pm @entity80 vs @entity73 24 may , 3pm @entity255 's struggles summed up @entity19 's awful start to the season , but he has finally scored			1

@entity17 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity19 are all in contention for top - four finish
@entity7 race promises to be most exciting in years
just three points separate third place from *eighth* in the table
@entity182 , @entity226 and @entity114 are among the key players who will decide the race for @entity272 riches
