mr @entity0 and members of the new @entity1 government pose outside the @entity75 after the prime minister 's address in the first meeting of his cabinet in his first speech to cabinet , the new prime minister sent a double message , one to the lenders - that the new government does not want things to be taken to a ' mutually destructive rupture ' but at the same time it will not concede to submission - and a second one to a domestic audience that it will decisively deal with the establishment of the past decades and corruption in a sign that the new government will take a hard line in haggling over the 240 - billion - euro package , @entity0 named leftwing economist @entity95 as finance minister			1
a fierce critic of the conditions imposed by creditors , @entity95 argues the country 's shattered economy will never recover until they are relaxed			2
the new ruling coalition - who together have 162 seats in the 300 - member parliament - must address an end - of - february deadline set by the @entity3 for @entity1 to carry out more reforms in return for a seven - billion - euro tranche of financial aid from the bloc and the @entity10			2
@entity0 , who has vowed to reverse many of the severe spending cuts and other measures that @entity1 's creditors insist on , must soon decide whether to delay the deadline			1
@entity1 's @entity64 partners have been quick to stymie the prospect of debt forgiveness , with @entity121 chancellor @entity120 's spokesman saying that @entity1 membership of the eurozone ' means ... sticking to its previous commitments			1
' however the @entity3 's governing body indicated wednesday that it was willing to show flexibility with the new @entity1 leaders to keep the debt - stricken nation in the eurozone			1
the @entity134 , @entity133 's @entity135 , said he ruled out any ' break ' between the @entity137 and the new @entity1 administration , the @entity133 daily @entity132 reported wednesday			0
the @entity137 and the @entity3 are willing to seek ' less intrusive , more flexible forms of cooperation ' with @entity28 , the paper quoted him as saying			0
finance minister @entity95 attends the first meeting in the parliament building in @entity28 where mr @entity0 told ministers voters had given them a mandate for radical change ' what we all want is that @entity1 recovers , creating growth and jobs , that it reduces inequality , that it can deal with the problem of its debt and remains in the euro area , ' he said			1
the head of the eurozone finance ministers , @entity158 , will visit @entity28 on friday ' to get to know ' @entity1 's new leaders , his spokeswoman said			1
but in a newspaper interview wednesday , a member of @entity121 's @entity163 central bank warned @entity28 of ' fatal consequences ' if it rejected the bailout terms			0
' if the continuation of the programme of aid for @entity1 is called into question ... @entity1 banks would lose access to central bank funds , ' @entity171 told the @entity121 business daily handelsblatt			0
' it would have fatal consequences for the @entity1 financial system			0

it wants to spend 1.2 billion euros to immediately increase the minimum wage and pensions for the poorest			0
however , the @entity10 extended an olive branch to the new government , saying it was prepared to continue its support to the country			0
@entity1 's economy is set to emerge from recession after shrinking by a quarter in five years , a slump that has left one in four out of work			2
many @entity1 say that even if @entity0 can deliver on a fraction of what he has promised , their lives will improve			0
@entity0 stands alone as @entity64 's first anti-austerity leader for the moment , but @entity32 's victory could inspire other movements born out of the crisis , including @entity207 's @entity206 , which is aiming for an absolute majority in the @entity207 election in november			0
