the @entity6 says drastic changes should be made to the running of hospitals so that senior staff , emergency tests and urgent surgery are quickly accessible each day			1
it suggests that patients should be checked by consultants daily because it is ‘ ethically unjustifiable ’ that patients should face greater risks on public holidays and weekends - when less experienced staff take over			1
@entity3 consultants should work on weekends because it is ' wrong ' for patients to be at greater risk on saturdays and sundays , a report has said ‘ it is wrong that a patient in hospital can suffer more because their stay includes a weekend and / or a bank holiday , ’ the report said			2
at present junior doctors are expected to staff hospitals at weekends and to rely on consultants who are ‘ on call ’ for emergencies			1
and some patients are currently made to wait up to four days to see a consultant because they do not work weekends , research from the 20 organisations which represent senior doctors showed			1
but it is ‘ ethically unjustifiable to provide a lower standard of care to patient at weekends than weekdays , ’ the document stated			0
as well as better access to consultants the colleges recommended that emergency surgery , diagnostic tests and results of those tests should be made more accessible on weekends			1
patients should expect laboratory services , x-ray , ultrasound and @entity57 scanning , emergency surgery , anaestheisa , physiotherapy , pharmacy and patient transport to work on a seven - day basis , the report said			2
at present junior doctors are expected to staff hospitals at weekends and to rely on consultants who are ' on call ' for emergencies research which emerged earlier this year showed that patients were 44 per cent more likely to die following planned surgery on a friday than those who had the same operations on a monday			1
other studies have found 16 per higher mortality among those admitted to hospital on sundays , compared with patients who fall ill during the week			0
professor @entity75 , @entity77 chairman for the academy , and president of the @entity80 , said : ‘ what we want to see is a health service that can truly meet the demands of the 21st century			0
' it is not acceptable that over weekends and bank holidays , patients receive a lower standard of care than they would during the week			0
’ he told the @entity98 : ‘ using the findings of this report , we must work together to re-shape hospital services in a way that strengthens the quality of care given to patients regardless of when they are admitted			0
’ the report predicts that changes will increase @entity3 costs in the short - term , but that the improvements in care could reduce costs in the long run			0
the colleges said hospitals will have to be centralised on fewer sites , to ensure there are enough specialists working in the right places .			0
