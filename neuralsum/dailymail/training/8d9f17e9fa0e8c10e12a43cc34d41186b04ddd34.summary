this is an excellent time to plant a hedge			1
@entity2 is close and if you get your plants into the ground by mid-march , they 'll enjoy the maximum number of growing days in their first year			1
hedges are valuable in so many ways			1
functionally , they make better windbreaks than walls and can muffle sound			1
you can use them to improve privacy , create enclosures , act as backdrops or mask unsightly objects			1
@entity20 also make lovely features			1
deciduous , evergreen , flowering , fruiting — they run through subtle changes with each season			2
you can plant low - growing ones for bordering paths , prettying up little beds or just to create formal patterns			1
lots of woody plants are suitable for hedging , but some adapt more readily than others			2
growth speeds vary , too , but here 's a golden rule : never choose plants purely for speed			2
@entity42 — the fastest — is a terrible choice because it ca n't produce new shoots from mature branches			2
so if you cut back an overgrown leyland hedge , you 'll be left with permanently hideous naked limbs			1
it had to be yew @entity49 , on the other hand , is perfect			1
even if cut back to a stump , it will grow as a dense bush			2
though not speedy , it grows faster than most people expect and thrives in a variety of conditions			2
what 's more , you can trim yew to any size and it needs cutting only once a year			1
@entity61 keeps its shape with a single annual clip and most varieties of common holly are suitable			2
those with plain green leaves tend to have more vigour than variegated varieties			2
@entity71 grows much faster , but needs several cuts each year			1
@entity74 ebbingei makes a fine hedge , too , but @entity76 is an excellent evergreen that flowers through winter			1
among deciduous hedging , beech and hornbeam keep their old foliage all winter			2
@entity84 copes well with heavy soils , but beech is better for chalky or sandy conditions			0
beat the blight for little hedges , box has been grown for centuries			0
it 's easy to clip and can be kept tiny , but there 's one big drawback — box blight			0
this serious disease damages mature hedging , so if you 're planting new , choose something else			0
the small @entity100 holly @entity99 is an excellent substitute			0
it 's robust , has tiny rounded leaves and clips to any size , even teeny			0
before planting your hedge , dig a roomy trench that will accommodate roots			1
to boost fertility , work compost into the trench bottom and mix in a little bonemeal			0
with bare - rooted hedging plants , make sure the roots never dry out			0
keep them heeled into the ground until your planting trench is ready			0
apply a mycorrhizal booster , such as @entity123 , to ensure rapid establishment			0
you can buy this from garden centres or online			0
tall plants will need support while they develop their root systems			0
use canes or light stakes and tie the main stems gently to these with jute string			0
@entity135 newly planted hedges regularly during their first summer , particularly during dry spells			0
and never allow weeds or grass to grow at the base of the developing hedge			1
after planting , i like to trim away as much as a third of the growth			0
this seems brutal , but will help stimulate new growth			0
when the young hedge grows back after its first trim , it should do so quickly and with denser branches			1
when your hedge is growing well , remove supports			1
trim as necessary , making it fractionally wider at the bottom than top			0
it will take years to develop the dense growth needed for a sound and durable hedge			1
at first , there 'll be ugly holes , thin zones and an uneven top			0
and with regular clipping and a few years ' loving care , it will be less like a row of shrubs and more like a proper grown - up hedge .			1

with spring on the way , now is the perfect time of year to plant a hedge
they are great windbreaks , create enclosures and mask unsightly objects
@entity20 can also be used to border paths and pretty up flower beds
