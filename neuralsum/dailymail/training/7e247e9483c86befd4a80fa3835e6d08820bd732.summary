visitors to this year 's @entity2 conference could be forgiven for assuming they had accidentally stumbled upon a @entity4 convention ... if the people in costume were n't some of the most powerful in the world			2
@entity8 and @entity9 were among 21 world leaders who attended the summit of @entity13 nations in @entity14 today dressed in traditional @entity16 tunics			1
but when the official photograph of the event was beamed around the world , many thought they better resembled the likes of @entity22 from the hit television and film franchise			0
@entity49 added : ' is this a new @entity50 ? ' however , @entity52 journalist @entity51 pointed out that the @entity2 has a ' rich tradition ' in dressing its members traditional clothing of the country holding the summit			0
' @entity58 to remember @entity8 's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant @entity2 fashion			2
see @entity64 , 2013 , ' she wrote , referring to the @entity66 ' endek ' woven shirt worn by secretary of state @entity64 and leaders attending the summit in @entity70 last year			0
meanwhile at the shoot , @entity71 president @entity8 appeared in no mood to break the ice with his @entity76 counterpart , and even looked away when the two crossed paths			0
@entity9 took centre stage at the official photocall , placed at the middle of leaders next to @entity16 president and event host @entity28			0
mr @entity8 , however , was left wedged between the wife of @entity70 's president and @entity87 's leader , @entity86 , on the periphery of the photograph			0
from left to right ( front ) @entity92 @entity91 , @entity94 president @entity93 , @entity76 president @entity9 , @entity16 president @entity28 and wife @entity30 and ( back ) @entity99 prime minister 's wife @entity100 and prime minister @entity101 , @entity103 prime minister @entity102 , @entity105 prime minister @entity104 and wife @entity96 - @entity95 snub : @entity8 was all smiles as he chatted to @entity16 premier @entity28 ( left ) but was less than welcoming when @entity9 walked past ( right ) tension : with @entity76 - @entity112 ties at their lowest point since the @entity115 , amid the dispute over @entity117 , the strain in their personal relations was clearly visible when the photograph was taken and the heads of state filed off stage , @entity8 seemed to turn his head as @entity9 came past , rather than catch his eye			1
the two leaders last met in june , when they exchanged a few words during a ceremony in @entity126 marking the d - day invasion anniversary			1
with @entity76 - @entity112 ties at their lowest point since the @entity115 , amid the dispute over @entity117 , the strain in their personal relations was clearly visible			1
together : after the photo call , @entity8 and @entity9 joined mr @entity28 , his wife and the other delegates to watch a spectacular firework display @entity132 : the firework display was held at the @entity133 on the sidelines of the @entity2 , in @entity14 , originally built for the @entity135 appearances : but @entity8 and @entity9 did not seem to talk to each other despite their close proximity			1
instead @entity8 joked with mr @entity28 while @entity9 spoke with @entity16 's first lady , @entity30 no stranger to cold : @entity9 wasted no time in trying to charm his hosts and wrapped his blanket around ms @entity30 to keep her warm keeping warm : she appeared to appreciate the gesture as @entity8 looked away the meal : ( left to right ) @entity76 president @entity9 , @entity16 president @entity28 with wife , @entity30 , president of indonesia @entity148 with wife , @entity150 , @entity71 president @entity8 , during the ceremonial reception held for members of the @entity154 ' meeting and , as these pictures show , today was no different			1
however , @entity9 's foreign affairs adviser , @entity156 , has said that no meeting has been set but that @entity9 and @entity8 have ' a good chance ' to meet on the sidelines			2
@entity156 emphasized that @entity9 was n't shunning such a meeting			0
in @entity163 , @entity162 national security adviser @entity161 said that while there were no plans for a formal meeting between @entity8 and @entity9 , ' i would n't be at all surprised if they had some informal communication			2

@entity170 attended @entity2 ( @entity2 ) summit in @entity14
they have n't met since june at d - day invasion anniversary in @entity126
there they *shared* a few words but strain in personal relations clearly visible
and today was no different when @entity8 looked away as @entity9 passed by
