property prices in @entity1 are soaring beyond the means of many would - be homeowners			1
but if you are willing to look further afield , you could become lord of a magnificent country manor for a fraction of the price of a simple apartment in the capital			1
estate agents @entity11 say the average price of a two - bedroom flat in the very heart of @entity1 has now risen to almost £ 1.1million			1
a typical example in @entity18 - not far from @entity16 - boasts just one reception room and a bathroom , in comparison to the roomy , remote locations on offer outside of the capital			1
yet if you do n’t need to commute , you could buy a substantial historic home in @entity26 or @entity27 for about half that price			1
here is our pick of some of the properties currently available ... @entity34 : if you like people , the 1830s - built @entity35 outside @entity36 has eight bedrooms , ideal for guests			1
if you do n't , it 's surrounded by trees at the end of its own gravel drive , so you can remain a recluse			1
but beware : the decor is more dated than a @entity48 joke @entity49 : a @entity51 church in the village of @entity53 has been converted into a three - bedroom home , with stained - glass windows intact			1
and what home is complete without double cart lodge , as this one boasts ? @entity59 : man the battlements			2
the five - bedroom @entity63 - built @entity62 near @entity65 has a distinctive crenellated roof			1
it 's also near to the beach ... but it is a @entity69 beach , so take your cagoule			0
@entity72 : with eight bedrooms , @entity73 could house several adults ... or several million woodworm if you do n't keep the timber frames treated			1
a @entity81 landmark , dating from the 15th century , it has a music room , drawing room , and even a formal rose garden			0
the adjoining paddock has planning permission for four detached houses , should it not yet be quite big enough for you @entity27 : if you 're prepared to tackle the upkeep of a thatched roof , this picture - postcard 1800s cottage ( originally built as a pair ) has four bedrooms and more charm than you could want			1
it 's not all old , though , as there 's a newly refurbished conservatory with underfloor heating @entity26 : more property , vicar ? originally dating from 1588 , this three - bedroom house was once the village vicarage for @entity105 - and it boasts barns , a stable block and a vegetable and fruit garden			1
there 's also a small orchard @entity59 : if you fancy yourself as the next @entity114 , this 1757 - built , seven - bedroom country house eight miles from @entity65 could be converted into a guest house			1
it comes with an acre of land and great views , too			0
@entity18 : instead of any of the above rural gems , a two - bedroom flat in this building not far from @entity16 , @entity1 , would set you back £ 1.1million @entity123 : something of a commute from anywhere - it 's 19 miles to the nearest station ( @entity129 ) then three hours to @entity130 - the 16th @entity131 , which has three bedrooms and two towers , was once owned by the @entity135 clan @entity136 : a special bargain , this seven - bedroom @entity138 house in @entity140 comes with eight acres , a billiard room and an orangery			1
nine months ago it was on the market for £ 1.7million - now agents are asking ' just ' £ 950,000 warning : @entity148 governor @entity147 said that the @entity149 must build new houses to avoid boom and bust the governor of the @entity148 has issued a stark warning that the booming housing market is now the biggest single threat to the economy – and said that the country must build more houses if it wants to avoid further catastrophic boom - and - bust cycles			1
@entity147 said not enough homes were being constructed to meet demand , and that there were signs that an increasing number of buyers were beginning to borrow heavily again			1
his warning comes as house prices soar in some parts of @entity149 – although in other areas they remain stagnant			0
mr @entity147 said : ‘ the biggest risk to financial stability , and therefore to the durability of the expansion – those risks centre in the housing market , and that ’s why we are focused on that			0
’ contrasting @entity149 with his native @entity180 , he added : ‘ the issues around the housing market in the @entity149 … [ are ] that there are not sufficient houses built in the @entity149			0
‘ [ there are ] half as many people in @entity180 as in the @entity149 , [ but ] twice as many houses are built in @entity180 every year than in the @entity149			0
’ official figures show 112,000 homes were constructed in @entity190 in the 12 months to march and that the number of new properties being started is rising			0
but the figure is still far below the 177,000 houses built in 2007			0
mr @entity147 – who issued the warning in an interview with @entity198 ’s @entity197 , to be broadcast today – also revealed there was a risk that home buyers are borrowing heavily once again , with signs that loans of four times a person ’s salary or more were starting to increase			1
‘ we do n’t want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium term , ’ he said			0
‘ we would be concerned if there were rapid increases in high loan - to - value mortgages across the banks ... we ’ve seen that creeping up and it ’s something that we are watching closely			1
’ the @entity148 has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent , despite pleas from some economists that action is needed to calm the bubble emerging in some regions			0
last week , mr @entity147 said the @entity148 judged the economy was still fragile and indicated rate rises were unlikely in the near future			0
when they came they would be ‘ limited ’ : ‘ the recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable , ’ he said			0
the @entity148 is widely expected to use tools other than an interest - rate rise to stem excessive borrowing			2
under new powers granted to it as part of an overhaul of financial regulation , it could require banks to set aside more capital reserves against home loans or tighten rules on lending			1
the @entity243 , which is chaired by the governor and is in charge of the stability of the financial system , is expected to outline how it might use those powers next month			0
estate agents are forcing desperate buyers to stump up thousands of pounds in unexpected fees to secure a home in @entity149 ’s increasingly heated property market			1
a probe has now been launched into the ‘ borderline illegal ’ , but increasingly widespread , practice			0
typically levied at two to 2.5 per cent of the sale price , the charge is paid by buyers who win a ‘ sealed bid ’ tender process , and means the agent is making money from both buyer and seller			2
property ombudsman @entity264 said he was ‘ very concerned ’ over the practice , which is most common in the hotspots of the @entity267			2
he told @entity268 he was seeking legal advice , adding : ‘ the agents ’ clear legal obligations are to the seller and entering into a contract with prospective buyers may well compromise that , and be seen as a conflict of interest			2
’ @entity278 chief @entity277 said : ‘ it allows the agents to cream even more money from both sides at a time when houses are practically selling themselves			0
’ but agents who impose the fees insist they are acting in a legal and transparent way which brings more buyers to the market			2
the entire @entity292 hamlet of @entity293 is going on the market on friday , complete with beach , boathouses , golf course and pub. all 728 acres have been owned by the same family for generations , and will have an asking price of £ 10million			2
the sleepy settlement - which has one pub and and a village shop - was bought up by a military commander in 1922 , and most residents rent their properties			2
scenic : the view over @entity293 , a sleepy hamlet which is on sale for £ 10million and now - thanks to a dispute over a food van - its 21 homes and other properties will be sold to the highest bidder			1
when @entity317 - one of the estate 's five directors - allowed a ' gastrobus ' to sell food and drink to visitors , she was deluged by complaints from locals attacking her act of ' commercialisation '			2
this , according to @entity327 , caused her to change her mind about bequeathing the estate to the visitors , and she amended her will to demand the village be put on the market			0
picturesque : the view over the bay from @entity293 in @entity292 @entity338 : the @entity293 cliffs , which could soon be sold off to developers she died in november , triggering the sale , which is being run by estate agents @entity344 and @entity345			0
if no single buyer emerges , they intend to split the village into six separate lots			0
the prospect of a new landlord has alarmed residents - many of whom rent their homes			2
@entity354 , the landlord of the @entity356 pub in the hamlet , said : ' the same families have lived here for generations			0
we came here five years ago and since then only one property has been sold			2
' another said : ' people are nervous , of course they are			0
we ’re worried that someone from @entity1 will see an ‘ opportunity ’			1
they ’ll kick the tenants out and turn the cottages into a " boutique hotel "			0

according to recent estimates , a two - bedroom flat in central @entity1 will now set buyers back by around £ 1.1million
but outside of the capital , property is far *cheaper* - with mansions available for much less
the more extravagant examples are *extremely* remote - but could provide *luxury* living for those who do n't commute
