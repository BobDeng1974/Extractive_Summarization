a @entity1 female sporting team are celebrating international victory as they take home the @entity4 for elephant polo			1
@entity7 , 45 , from @entity8 , @entity6 scored all 27 goals and secured a triumph for her team , the @entity11 , at the annual tournament in @entity13 last week			1
the unusual game involves two teams of up to four players sitting on top of the enormous animals , and is played in a similar manner to regular polo			1
@entity7 ( second left ) celebrates winning the @entity4 for @entity21 with her team mates @entity22 to keep the sport fair , teams swap elephants at half time to ensure victory does not come down to who has the better elephant			1
eco-tourism travel consultant @entity7 has already made a name for herself in the sport after she came third in 2013 and second in 2012			2
however , @entity7 had not yet made it to championship status and said that she was over the moon to finally have triumphed			2
@entity21 works under similar rules as the original game however it sees players swap horses to ride elephants ' i 've been playing for 15 years now and i 'm just ecstatic			1
i had no idea how good it felt to be a champion until i became one			0
i have to keep pinching myself			0
' we had gotten so close in recent years and it 's great to finally win a tournament			0
we 're very competitive but are very nice about it			0
' i was very fortunate to play with such a good bunch of ladies that would get the ball to me as often as they could			0
' @entity7 first discovered the sport while on a gap year to @entity13 in the 80s @entity7 added that living in @entity55 provided some logistical issues when it came to getting practice in for matches			1
' unfortunately , we do n't have an elephant at home so it is quite difficult to train in the gaps between playing but i 'd say it 's important to keep fit			0
' i play quite a lot of tennis and golf and find that the skills in those sports are very transferable			0
' it 's kind of like riding a bike , once you know how to ride an elephant that never leaves you			2
' @entity7 had already made a name for herself in the sport after she had come third in 2013 and second in 2012 @entity7 first discovered the game around thirty years ago in @entity13 and has since developed it into a full time hobby			1
' i first heard of the sport in the 80s when i was working in @entity13 on a gap year but did n't really get into it until the turn of the century			2
' my husband @entity83 has played and won in the past so it 's particularly sweet to have bragging rights over him this time around			2
' @entity55 players have been dominant since the sport was invented in 1983 as teams have been successful 11 times with a @entity91 on their side and being @entity55 herself @entity7 does not break the tradition			1
@entity13 has registered elephant polo as an @entity97 sport which means that if @entity99 were to ever host the @entity97 then elephant polo would be played on an exhibition basis			1
@entity7 's husband @entity83 , 53 , is the chairman of the @entity102 and a former world champion			1
he had also played in the championships and said although he had not been met by the same victory as his wife he was very pleased for her			0
' of course i 'm disappointed to have lost but once my team were knocked out i wanted @entity7 to win			1
' @entity83 added that the @entity55 penchant for another club - based game might explain their success in the exotic sport			0
' i think @entity55 is actually quite well placed to produce great elephant polo players as the home of golf since a lot of the skills are transferable			1
' experience counts for a lot in this sport and i 've been playing for 28 years now and do n't really practice until i 'm back on an elephant			0
' another reason that @entity55 might be so good at it is that during the day you play hard then at night party harder			0
' the sport has raised over Â£ 600,000 for elephant welfare charities and the elephants competing in the world cup remain in their natural environment			2
the defending players must be 15 metres from the spot source : @entity135			0

@entity7 scored 27 goals and secured first place victory at the games in @entity13
elephant polo has similar rules to the original game but instead of horses sees players ride elephants
she and her husband both play the game and she said it had been ' sweet ' to secure a win over her former world champion partner
