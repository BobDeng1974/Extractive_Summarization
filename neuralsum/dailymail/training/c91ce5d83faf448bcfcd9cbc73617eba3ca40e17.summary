' it 's really just a question of whether we 're willing to acknowledge and honor what we know , and act on it in a positive way			0
' often , we let our fears get in the way , or we shut it down because we do n't want to believe there is another way , and we do n't want to listen			0
' i have been there , too , trust me			0
i have completely ignored what i knew to be true because i did n't like the truth - it was n't what i wanted			2
