by @entity0 for @entity1 they may look like farm workers in the fields of the tranquil @entity6 countryside			0
but specialist @entity7 and his colleague @entity8 are actually combing the landscape for unexploded shells fired almost 100 years ago during the @entity11			1
the pair are among a handful of men known in @entity6 as ' les demineurs ' , loosely translated as ' the sweepers ' whose sole task it is to collect unexploded munitions from fields in northern @entity6			1
@entity8 , left and @entity7 , centre , pry a 155mm artillery shell from the @entity11 out of the ground after it was discovered in a field in @entity25 owned by @entity26 , right mr @entity7 then discovers an unexploded 150mm @entity28 artillery shell , dropped during the @entity11 , in the long grass of a field near the city of @entity32 mine - clearing specialist mr @entity7 carefully carries away two unexploded @entity6 70mm artillery shells found by a local farmer in his field mr @entity8 holds a @entity28 105mm artillery shell , which had lay in a corn field after being dropped during the @entity11 most of the unexploded shells they collect are from the @entity11 , with many being found between the city of @entity32 and the @entity28 border around 60 miles away			1
fighting around @entity32 was particularly intense during the conflict and it is estimated that millions of both @entity6 and @entity28 shells are still strewn across the region			2
during the 10 - month @entity32 in 1916 artillery barrages in some areas were so intense that thousands of artillery shells fell on average per each square metre			0
mr @entity7 and his team of demineurs expect they and their successors will be collecting shells still for centuries to come			2
fighting around @entity32 , where farmer @entity26 owns fields , was particularly intense during the @entity11 , meaning the discovery of shells is common although some who discover the shells try to destroy the ammunition themselves , mr @entity7 recommends that the bomb clearance unit be notified mr @entity8 holds the inner pieces of a 75mm anti-personnel @entity6 artillery shell from the @entity11 they also found a @entity28 mortar shell called a ' taube ' , left , which means pigeon , while others , right , may have contained chemical agents mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 measure an unexploded shell , which turns out to be a 155mm artillery shell from @entity11 he explained : ' today we need more space , we build new houses , and what happens ? we stir up the earth			1
when you stir up the earth , you keep the legacy of this war which are the shells , the grenades and the mortars			0
' so in this sense , the war is not over			0
and i think , in the area where we are now , it will continue for 100 or 200 years			0
' although some who discover the shells try to destroy the ammunition themselves mr @entity7 recommends that the bomb clearance unit be notified and the dangerous work be carried out by professionals			2
the shells , including this unexploded @entity28 250mm shell , are taken to a storage facility in @entity103 for safe keeping once in the storage facility , the unexploded ordnance is then taken away , so it can be disposed of safely @entity106 figures on the number of deaths due to exploded shells are hard to come by , but two experts from the @entity103 unit were killed in 2007 after a shell they were transporting detonated			1
mr @entity7 said that given the number of munitions that remain in the area and are yet to be discovered , ' it 's almost impossible that nothing will happen			1
' ' someone said once , " the bomb does its own thing "			0
' in normal conditions if it 's in a certain position , you can carry it around taking a number of precautions			0
' you might be able to carry a million of them but the next one might explode			0
' most of the unexploded shells they collect are from the @entity11 , with many being found between the city of @entity32 and the @entity28 border around 60 miles away these @entity28 shells , that were taken to the storage facility in @entity103 and stand in a bin , are thought to possibly contain chemical warfare agents			1

specialist @entity7 and his colleague @entity8 collect unexploded ordnance from the @entity11
the pair are among a handful of men whose sole task it is to collect the munitions in the fields of northern @entity6
most shells are found between the city of @entity32 and the @entity28 border around 60 miles away
the area was the scene of heavy shelling during the @entity32 in 1916 , when thousands of shells were fired
mr @entity7 believes unexploded shells will still be discovered 100 years from now due to the numbers still hidden
