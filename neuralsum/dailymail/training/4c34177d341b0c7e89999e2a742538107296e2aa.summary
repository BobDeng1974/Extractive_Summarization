the man used a giant wave to take care of a serious eye condition known as pterygium , in which fibrous tissue grows over the outer layer of the eye			1
the ailment , popularly known as ' surfer 's eye , ' is is common in people who spend a lot of time outdoors in sunny climates			2
normally , pterygium requires surgery to treat			0
however , the 61 - year - old surfer took a more radical route			1
the surfer 's eye three days after he stuck his head in the water to remove excess tissue from his eye though he did suffer mild inflammation as a result he dipped his head in cascading water while riding a huge 30 - foot wave in @entity28 , a popular surfing spot known for big waves off the coast of @entity32 , according to research published recently in the journal @entity35			1
' he momentarily dipped his face into the water while travelling at top speed , but was able to recover his balance and continue surfing the wave , ' dr. @entity37 , a medical officer at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity36 wrote in the journal article late last month			2
' this impressive maneuver resulted in the pterygium being ripped off his eye surface , ' he added			0

. the pterygium is not easy to remove , even with scalpels and scissors , dr. @entity58 , an opthamologist at @entity60 's @entity59 told @entity64			0
@entity58 said it 's likely the force of the water from the wave ripped his conjunctiva , a membrane on the eye 's surface , that would have provided a blood supply to the pterygium			1
although big wave surfers can reach speeds of 30 or 40 miles per hour , it 's not easy for the blunt force of water to rip off a pterygium			1
this vascular tissue is even difficult to remove with scalpels and scissors , said dr. @entity58 , an ophthalmologist at @entity59 in @entity60			0
' but it would take a heck of shot of water to do that , ' he added			0
' pretty unlikely this is going to happen to anyone else			0
