the @entity179 said the story had emanated from a freelance journalist who had been told by a source close to @entity186 herself and added : ‘ mr @entity178 ’s allegations are mendacious smears driven by his hatred of the media			1
’ challenged about his hacking claims against the @entity179 , mr @entity178 was asked by counsel for the inquiry @entity218 : ‘ you have n’t alleged that before , have you , in the public domain ? i think the highest it can be put is frankly it ’s a piece of speculation on your part , is n’t it , in relation to this question ? ’ during a combative appearance , the actor also accused the @entity229 of obtaining information about the recent birth of his baby with @entity234 ex-girlfriend @entity233 from a source at a @entity96 hospital			1
the @entity179 unequivocally denied the allegation , saying the information came from a showbusiness source two weeks after the birth , and stressing that it spent a further two weeks seeking a response from mr @entity178 ’s representatives			1
