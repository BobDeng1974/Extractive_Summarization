by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor mothers of the bride and groom will be added to marriage registers for the first time , @entity2 announced today			1
the prime minister said the change – the first in 150 years – addressed ‘ another inequality in marriage ’			0
the current system , which dates back to the early years of @entity16 @entity15 's reign , only records the fathers ’ names			2
but mr @entity2 said this did not reflect modern @entity20			1
@entity2 , speaking at the @entity21 at the @entity22 of @entity23 's in central @entity24 this morning , said mothers should be included on the marriage register marriage certificates in @entity28 and @entity29 only record the names of couples fathers - not mothers he said @entity20 had recently sent a ‘ powerful message ’ by legalising gay marriage but needed to go further			1
it comes after tens of thousands of campaigners signed a petition calling for mothers ' names to be added to marriage certificates			1
there is space for the name of the father of the bride and the father of the groom and their occupations today , mr @entity2 said : ' we 're going to address another inequality in marriage too			0
' the content of marriage registers in @entity28 and @entity29 has not changed since the beginning of @entity16 @entity15 's reign			0
' at the moment , they require details of the couples ' fathers but not their mothers			1
' this clearly does n't reflect modern @entity20 – and it 's high time the system was updated			1
so i have asked the @entity66 to look at how we can address this too			0
' the petition calling for mothers ’ names to be included on the certificate , published on the campaigning website @entity74 , appeals for a move away from the view in which marriage is seen as ‘ a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom ’			1
the last change to the marriage register rules took place during the reign of @entity16 @entity88 , the prime minister said today currently , in @entity28 and @entity29 , marriage certificates include space for the name of the @entity92 and the @entity93 , with separate boxes allocated to each of their occupations			2
the mothers of the happy couple are excluded from this official documentation			2

according to the petitioner , the lack of mothers ' names on marriage certificates in @entity28 and @entity29 ‘ is part of a much wider pattern of inequality			1
women are routinely silenced and written out of history			0
’ the format of the @entity28 and @entity29 marriage certificate has remained unchanged since the @entity122 of 1837			0
mr @entity2 ’s announcement that mothers ’ names would be added to the marriage certificate came in a speech in central @entity24 this morning in which he called for more to be done to help families			1

he said single parents did ‘ an absolutely brilliant job in bringing up children ’			0
he added : ‘ there are some cases where it is better for parents to split up			0
‘ i would n't for one minute want to stop that			0
but where you can help people come together and stay together , then surely the government should play its part			0
’ government figures also show @entity20 has 500,000 ‘ troubled families ’ , costing the state more than £ 30billion a year			2
he announced there would be a new ‘ family friendly test ’ , to ensure every new policy does not damage family life .			0
