a young woman who dismissed a brown mark on her arm as melted chocolate was later told it was a cancerous mole			1
at first , @entity5 , 26 , tried to wipe off the brown spot , believing it was the remnants of a chocolate bar she had been eating			1
but concerned when it did n't go away , she visited a doctor , who reassured her it was nothing to worry about			2
when she realised it was a mole , she saw her gp - but was told there was nothing to worry @entity22 , 26 , was eventually diagnosed with melanoma - the most deadly form of skin cancer - after a different doctor noticed her mole during an appointment for a chest infection it was only months later that another doctor happened to notice the mole - and she was eventually diagnosed with melanoma , the most deadly form of skin cancer			1
@entity22 , a youth worker who lives in @entity35 , then underwent three operations to completely remove the mole and save her life			1
at age 22 , @entity5 noticed the 2cm spot in the mirror and headed straight to her doctor			1
she was reassured that as she was so young , the chocolate - coloured mole was nothing to worry about			1
but seven months later when she was at her gp surgery for a chest infection , her doctor noted the mole as a cause for concern and decided to keep an eye on it			1
it was only when @entity22 returned in february for a check - up that she found out the smudge she had at first thought was a blob of melted chocolate was actually skin cancer			1
she underwent initial surgery a week after her diagnosis and then two further operations to make sure the cancer was completely removed			2
she underwent three operations to completely remove the cancer , and has now fully recovered the following @entity65 rules show some changes that might indicate a ' melanoma ' , the deadliest form of skin cancer			1
as skin cancers vary , it is important to tell a doctor about any changes to the skin , even if they are not mentioned here			0
@entity76 - the two halves of the area may differ in shape border - the edges of the area may be irregular or blurred , and sometimes show notches colour - this may be uneven			0
different shades of black , brown and pink may be seen diameter - most melanomas are at least 6mm in diameter			0
report any change in size , shape or diameter to your doctor expert - if in doubt , check it out if your gp is concerned about your skin , make sure you see a consultant dermatologist , the most expert person to diagnose a skin cancer			2
source : @entity108 @entity107 of @entity109 even now she has six - monthly check - ups and diligently checks all of her moles once a week to make sure there have been no changes			0
@entity5 was supported by the @entity115 who put her in touch with other young people who have also had the same type of cancer			2
but she is determined not to wallow , wants to share her experience to help make other young people aware of the risks			0
@entity22 said : ' i mistook my mole for chocolate and so quickly realised that it was something much more serious			1
' never did i think something so small or seemingly insignificant could have such a big effect			0
' one day i saw this big mark on my arm			2
i thought it was chocolate and tried to wipe it off			2
' then i realised that it was a mole i had always had that had changed dramatically			2
' it was april , so i 'd been wearing long - sleeved tops practically all of the time through the winter and not noticed it			0
' i went to the doctor who shrugged it off and said it was nothing to worry about			0
' you 're so young that you think these kind of things do n't happen to you			0
' the following november , she visited the @entity100 with a chest infection and another doctor noticed the mole			1
she said : ' when i took my jumper off for the doctor to listen to my chest she noticed and said she wanted to keep an eye on it			1
' i went back in february for some tests and a week later i had a phone call saying that the doctor wanted to have a chat			1
@entity22 said talking to other young cancer sufferers through the @entity115 made her feel less alone ' i did n't even think that it was anything to worry about until the doctor explained that it was melanoma and they needed to take action as quickly as possible			1
' miss @entity5 then underwent three operations to have the cancer removed			2
she said : ' i had a big lump taken out of my arm at the beginning of march but i was really lucky that it was caught so early			0
' at first they checked me every three months and now it 's every six months ' i am really careful in the sun now and prefer to go on holidays where it wo n't be too hot			0
' talking to other young people suffering cancer made her feel less alone			0
she said : ' i spoke to a contact from the @entity115 at the hospital and she put me in touch with other young people who had a similar experience			0
' i was able to talk about everything i was going through on the online forums which made a huge difference in helping me overcome the cancer			0
' i thought i was the only person going through it but being able to speak to other people in the same position made me feel so much more normal ! '			0
