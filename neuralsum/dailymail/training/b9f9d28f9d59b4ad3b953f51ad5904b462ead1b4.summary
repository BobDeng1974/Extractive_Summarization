by @entity0 and @entity1 a lot may have changed in the last century but it seems one thing has n't - a woman 's quest for eternal youth and the bizarre lengths she 'll go to in order to look younger			2
today women will try vampire facials and dermarollers to banish wrinkles			1
but a book has revealed that in @entity15 times they had less sophisticated beauty methods but still believed in no pain , no gain			1
in @entity20 and @entity21 , a 1910 book by @entity23 , recently unearthed on @entity24 , the author emphasises the importance of keeping skin firm and tightened , especially around the face and neck			1
she recommends vigorous self - massage and various oils and creams			1
@entity33 beauty regime : a book from 1910 recommends vigorous self - massage to banish a double chin miracle weightloss cure : the author believes the technique will also give you thin arms massage was also recommended to reduce swollen eyelids , left , while tinting eyebrows and lashes was in fashion just like today ' it is a fact always to be remembered that the tendency of flesh on the face is to droop downward with age , ' she writes			1
' so all muscles and cords must be rubbed up , to prevent their stretching			2
' a photo demonstrating how this is done shows a woman in an elaborately ruffled nightgown sitting in front of a sink , her palms rubbing against each cheek			2
the caption reads : ' face massage , showing upward stroke on cheek - must be hard '			2
at night , @entity23 recommends applying a mixture of almond oil , white wax , lanoline , elderflower water , witch hazel and spermaceti - a wax made from the head cavities of sperm whales			1
application is different depending on your face shape , however			2
' rub gently to increase the flesh and make the cheeks round , ' she says			0
alternatively , ' if a double chin or superfluous flesh is to be removed , rub vigorously to wear away the fat by friction			1
' outdated : @entity20 and @entity21 , a 1910 book by @entity23 , contains odd tips like massaging the face with a mixture containing spermaceti - a wax made from the head cavities of sperm whales soft skin : one of the seemingly older pieces of advice is eradicating wrinkles by using adhesive plaster not a modern idea : women a century ago had their own form of dry shampoo another way to maintain clear skin , according to this 1910 beauty expert , was by embracing the elements			1
' even in extreme cases shampooing is not to be done oftener than once in three weeks ' ' walking in the rain , for persons who are not susceptible to cold , is an excellent tonic for the complexion , ' she writes			0
surprisingly , modern celebrity make - up artist @entity112 - whose clients have included @entity114 and @entity115 - told @entity116 that this advice ' was n't that far off '			2
' today the closest thing would be to probably give your face a good steam ! ' she said			2
when it comes to haircare , it appears women in the early 1900s were equally averse to over-washing - although the period they could tolerate between shampoos was significantly longer			0
' even in the extreme cases of exudation shampooing is not to be done oftener than once in three weeks , ' @entity23 advises			1
staying youthful : ' by the time a woman is twenty - five years old she should devote at least ten minutes , night and morning , to massaging her throat under the chin , ' she writes excess grease , like today , was dealt with by using a sort of dry shampoo			1
' should the hair become heavy with grease during the intervening weeks much of it can be removed by sprinkling the locks thickly with fine corn meal , ' she says			0
the cornmeal is then ' brushed out after absorbing the dirt , with a long but soft - bristled brush			0
' @entity23 writes that being in the sun gives ' tone and vigor ' to hair , ' and to dry one 's hair in the sun after washing it is ideal '			1
she takes it a step further when she writes just how essential sunshine is			0
' so important do i regard this treatment that i consider it an error to wash the hair on a damp or cloudy day , ' she writes			0
and her views on brushing your hair before bed were apparently non-negotiable			0
' i believe that it is impossible for a girl to have pretty hair , and i know that she can not possess luxuriant tresses when an old woman , unless she brushes and combs her tresses before going to bed , ' she asserts			0
unlikely method : ' if a double chin or superfluous flesh is to be removed , rub vigorously to wear away the fat by friction ' in order to ensure a strong head of hair in old age , she advises ' at least twenty long strokes of the brush after all snarls have been removed with a comb '			1
physical exercise , she wrote , could be done to benefit both the complexion and the figure - a statement that still holds true to this day			0
' exercises must be taken before an open window to clear the complexion ' but the manner in which women were advised to exercise - and the clothes in which they carried out these routines - are a true mark of the times			0
' an excellent garment to wear when going through these movements is a light flannel dressing sacque that will give warmth without impeding the freedom of movement , ' writes @entity23			1
' i mention this article of wearing apparel because the exercises must be taken before an open window to clear the complexion , and if one is not properly clad , the flesh might become chilled , ' she explains ' felt or woolen slippers must also be worn , ' she adds , presumably to similarly avoid ' chilled flesh '			0
keep fit : women were told to touch their toes to keep their waistline small ... and do the housework @entity217 : while some of the ' hints ' are undoubtedly undated , others have held true to this day - like trimming cuticles when giving yourself a manicure an activity she recommends for keeping fit and ' developing the figure ' is housework , like sweeping , dusting and washing			1
' @entity229 is excellent exercise for a girl who wishes to develop a round , pretty figure , ' she says , ' for [ it ] helps to strengthen and beautify the body			0
' she goes on to elucidate how a woman should hold back her shoulders and bend at the waist while carrying out household chores to get the most benefit out of it .			0
