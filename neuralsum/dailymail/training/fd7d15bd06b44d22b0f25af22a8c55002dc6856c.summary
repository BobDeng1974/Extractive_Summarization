conservative @entity8 ( left ) said hospitals should take a leaf out of the book of @entity3 's former host , antiques expert @entity11 ( right ) ‘ the economic climate has meant that households across the @entity27 are trying to make their money go further , bargain hunting is no longer just for the thrifty , but a commonplace part of modern life			1
’ in an attempt to save £ 1.5billion a year dr @entity8 will today announce plans to require hospitals to publish how much they pay for goods and services so that patients and the public can compare them			2
some @entity5 trusts are paying three times as much as others for prosthetic limbs , rubber gloves and syringes			1
in some cases hospitals spend £ 56.50 for a box of 100 surgical gloves while a comparable glove is available for £ 34.90 per 100			0
a standard 10cm x 10cm polyurethane foam dressing is available for £ 11.74 per pack of ten , but some trusts still prefer to purchase a brand that costs £ 19.87 per pack of ten , a price difference of 74 per cent per pack			0

' when our @entity5 is the single biggest organisation in the @entity27 , hospitals must wake up to the potential to make big savings and radically change the way they buy supplies , goods , services and how they manage their estates			0
‘ we must end the scandalous situation where one hospital spends hundreds of thousands more than another hospital just down the road on something as simple as rubber gloves or syringes , simply because they have n’t got the right systems in place to ensure value for money for local patients			2
‘ this kind of poor resource management can not go on , and this radical new strategy will help our nhs get a grip on wasteful spending to drive real change and improved procurement practices so that more of our @entity5 ’s resources can be spent on frontline patient care			0
