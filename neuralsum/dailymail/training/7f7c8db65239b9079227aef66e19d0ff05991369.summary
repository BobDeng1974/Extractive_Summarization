by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 8 may 2012 a young mother was told her baby son had a condition that could potentially leave him brain damaged from a stranger on the internet			1
@entity7 discovered six - month - old @entity8 had the rare condition trigonocephaly because a woman whose son has the same thing spotted the tell - tale signs on a @entity15 profile picture			1
the woman spotted the ridge running down @entity8 's forehead - a sign that he has the condition			1
it is so serious that without an operation the one - year - old could be left permanently brain damaged			1
@entity24 , 22 , who lives with @entity8 ’s father - car factory worker @entity26 - in @entity27 , @entity28 , said she was angry the condition was not spotted by doctors earlier			1
relieved : @entity7 and @entity26 with their son @entity31 , who they discovered had a rare skull condition from somebody who made the diagnosis over @entity15 she said she also wanted to tell other parents so babies affected could get the help they need			1
@entity24 said : ' my son is six months old and i found out that he has something quite rare			1
' all the doctors i ’ve been to see and even the health visitors have n’t picked up on this			1
it was a mum whose son has the same thing			1
' if she had n’t got in touch he could have ended up severely brain damaged			1
unaware : ms @entity7 had been using a picture of @entity8 on @entity15 when one of her online friends spotted the signs of trigonocephaly - something her own son suffers from ' all i want to do is raise awareness so other people can notice it and get something done before it ’s too late			1
' when baby @entity8 was born @entity24 said she noticed that he had a misshapen head but he was checked over and given the all - clear			1
@entity63 is the fusion of the two frontal parts of the skull , also known as the metopic suture			2
the metopic suture runs from the top of the head , at the fontanel or soft spot , down the center of the forehead to the nose			2
it is the only part of the skull that begins closing in infancy			2
in cases of @entity63 , a ridge can be seen running down the center of the forehead and the fontanel is usually closed			2
children with @entity63 will have a forehead that looks narrow , and the child 's eyes are often spaced closer together than is normal			2
the forehead will have a triangular shape , like the bow of a boat			2
@entity63 affects between one in 2,500 to one in 3,500 babies			0
it can be difficult to diagnose the condition due to the the variations in severity			0
it is not known what precisely causes @entity63			0
however , the children of mothers who have taken @entity97 for seizures can be more at risk			0
it was thought after the birth his different head shape could be a sign of @entity105 but when he was checked by a pediatrician at @entity107 it was dismissed and he was discharged			0
after being warned that her son could have trigonocephaly she contacted a specialist at @entity111 and received the diagnosis the same day			0
the condition is caused when the frontal part of the skull fuses together to produce a head shaped like the bow of a ship			0
@entity24 , who is on maternity leave from her admin job at a care agency , said if the condition goes unnoticed it can cause blindness , severe learning difficulties and in worst cases even death			0
@entity24 said : ' when he was diagnosed i was absolutely devastated , not only with the diagnosis but he will need a major operation at one year which will leave him with a scar from ear to ear which he will have for life			0
' and if it had n’t been noticed by this woman i dread to think what he would have gone through and what his life would have been like			0
' craniofacial consultant @entity141 at @entity111 said trigonocephaly was a very rare condition and often not picked up immediately			0
a spokeswoman for @entity107 said : ' we always take concerns relating to care provided by this @entity147 very seriously and where appropriate we will investigate thoroughly			0
