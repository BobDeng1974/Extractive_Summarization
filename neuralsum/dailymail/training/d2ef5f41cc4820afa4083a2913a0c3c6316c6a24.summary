by @entity0 @entity2 the security robot moves around at the @entity4 offices in @entity5 , @entity6 it may look more like the robot from ' @entity9 ' than the terrifying droids in ' terminator ' , but this machine could be the future of fighting crime			1
@entity2 , the first robotic security guard in the @entity15 , is the latest recruit employed by @entity4 to help secure its headquarters in @entity6			1
when the metal minder spots something out of place , he stores the information on his internal hard - drive and quickly reports it to his human counterparts			2
the autonomous android can even speak to his colleagues , ask for help when he gets stuck , and plug himself in to charge when his battery runs low			0
the blue machine is part of a £ 7.2 million ( $ 12.2 million ) robot pilot project by the @entity32 to get robots in offices around the world			1
‘ @entity2 is not about replacing our security officers ; the security officers are at the point of use , ’ said @entity4 spokesman @entity36			1
‘ they are able to make incisive , very , very quick decisions about changes in the environment			0
‘ @entity2 is a complimentary activity that can do guard tours over a period of time overnight or during the day , but also pick up on some of the low level activities that the guard does n't necessary need to be involved in			2

if he spots something has changed since his last visit , he analyses it and sends the information to a real security guard			2
using cameras and scanners he is able to create a map of his surrounding area , plotting the location of desks and chairs , as well as detecting people moving , and learning how the environment changes			0
@entity2 ( pictured ) knows the floor plan of the office in @entity5 , @entity6 , and rolls from room to room , scanning and filming in @entity73 , using technology similar to games consoles			1
if he spots something has changed since his last visit , he analyses it and sends the information to a real security guard it is hoped the pilot project will help @entity2 ( pictured ) learn more about coping with other people - and machines - in the workplace security robot @entity102 at the @entity4 offices in @entity5 is pictured on the left , while the right image shows the control screen used to control @entity2 's actions it is hoped the pilot project will help @entity2 learn more about coping with other people - and machines - in the workplace			1
dr @entity120 , from the @entity121 at the @entity32 , said : ‘ current robots are n't very good with their hands , or able to manipulate objects , however @entity2 is good at driving around and monitoring objects , so is perfect for a job in security as a night or day watchman where he can monitor what is going on in his immediate surroundings			1
‘ we want to see @entity2 survive on his own for up to 15 days , doing jobs that are useful for security , for example , checking whether fire doors are obstructed , whether there is paper on desks			1
’ the project is being led by the @entity121 at the @entity32			1
a similar robot called @entity135 is currently being tested in a care home in @entity137 , @entity138 , as part of the same project			2
@entity135 will carry out similar security duties to @entity2 , but he is also able to play simple games with residents in the home			2
in a country dominated by ' kawaii ' - or cute culture - @entity147 has embraced the rise of cuddly robots			0
now , one @entity152 - based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world 's first droid that can read human emotions			0
mobile carrier @entity157 said its robot , named @entity159 , will go on sale in @entity147 in february for 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 )			0
the machine , which has no legs , but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a @entity152 suburb , cooing and humming			0
@entity159 uses an ' emotional engine ' and a cloud - based artificial intelligence to study gestures , expressions and human speech tones			0
the 48 - inch ( 121 cm ) tall , 62 lb ( 28 kg ) white @entity159 has no hair , but two large doll - like eyes and a flat - panel display stuck on its chest			0
it was developed jointly with @entity177 , which designs , produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots .			0

@entity2 rolls from room to room at @entity4 offices in @entity6
if something looks *suspicous* , @entity2 analyses it and informs human security
@entity2 is on a three - week trial with scientists *assessing* his *performance*
the machine is part of a £ 7.2 million ( $ 12.2 million ) project by the @entity32 to get droids into offices worldwide
