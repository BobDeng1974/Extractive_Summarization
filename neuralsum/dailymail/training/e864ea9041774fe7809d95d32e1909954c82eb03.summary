by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 04:01 est , 9 november 2012 when you 're the @entity4 , the role of ' back seat driver ' becomes a rather more esteemed position			2
it means full control of a ' traffic light system ' - with the capability of ordering the driver when to stop , slow or start at the touch of the button			1
her majesty commissioned a green @entity15 in 1978 with such functions and it is now up for sale to the highest bidder			1
the @entity21 vehicle , built for the @entity4 , is expected to fetch between £ 15,00 and £ 18,000 when it goes up for sale at an auction the vehicle comes complete with a ' traffic light ' system which the @entity4 used to control the driver of the time and tell them when she wanted to stop , slow down or start the journey in 1979 the vehicle was sent to a workshop where engineers fitted the 4x4 with an unconventional ‘ traffic light system ’ , allowing @entity4 to control the vehicle			1
and despite being almost 35 years old , the car - dubbed @entity4 ’s @entity15 - has covered just 1,892 miles from new and appears to be in almost perfect condition			1
the vehicle , perfect for a @entity40 , is being sold by the @entity41			0
the industrious off - roader is being auctioned on saturday november 24 at the historics at @entity44 near @entity45 , @entity46			0
it is being offered at the bargain estimate of between £ 15,000 and £ 18,000 but , because it is owned by the @entity41 , is subject to @entity49 if sold within the @entity50			1
a @entity15 used by sir @entity51 recently sold for £ 129,000 - more than twice its initial estimate			1
and @entity53 , from the @entity54 , believes £ 15,000 for the @entity4 ’s old model would be a bargain			0
the front seat where a light would show up on the driver 's control box which would tell him what the @entity4 wanted to do in the back despite the vehicle being almost 35 - years - old , it has covered just 1,892 miles he said : ' it is a very special model and i am sure it will attract a lot of interest			2
' the fact it was used by the @entity4 makes it all the more interesting and a £ 15,000 estimate seems stupidly low			0
' i think it will sell for a lot more with that provenance and hopefully it will go to a museum and someone will look after it			0
' the @entity15 was the most common @entity15 with 440,000 built at the company ’s factory in @entity81 between 1971 and 1985			2
fit for a queen : side - profile of the 1978 @entity15 3 designed to be robust and easy to repair , it has been claimed that 70 per cent of all @entity85 are still on the road - although very few will have a mileage as low as the @entity82			2
@entity89 , director at @entity90 , said : ' we are excited and honoured to be entrusted with the task of finding a new home for such a unique vehicle			0
' we pride ourselves on bringing distinctive vehicles to auction , and despite prolific production of the @entity99 , it ’s highly unlikely one like this will ever come to auction again			0
