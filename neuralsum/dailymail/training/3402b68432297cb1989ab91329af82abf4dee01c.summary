@entity0 have got to play keep ball @entity0 played well on saturday and it was good to see them going for it in attack , but i still worry that we do n’t keep the ball well enough			1
the stats say @entity0 completed 91 per cent of their passes , but everything was done at 100mph			1
as a neutral that ’s great because it makes for exciting , end - to - end stuff but it ’s impossible to keep up that tempo in the heat			0
when you do lose possession against a side as good on the ball as @entity21 , you end up chasing shadows			1
by the end of the match @entity0 players were on the floor with cramp			1
you did n’t see any @entity28 going down exhausted			0
that ’s because they know how to take the sting out of a game			0
when they need to they make simple passes so the players can grab a breather			0
until @entity0 learn to do that , we will still struggle against the very best sides			1
struggling : @entity42 and @entity43 help @entity44 after he goes down with cramp in the latter stages of @entity0 's defeat to @entity21 wilting in the heat : @entity49 throws water over his face to cool down in the hot conditions of @entity53 @entity0 ’s options for a perfect 10 this week , @entity56 will have to make the biggest managerial call of his @entity0 career : who should he play at number 10 against @entity61 ? there will be a clamour for @entity56 to drop @entity49 but @entity61 would be delighted if he was not on the team - sheet			1
they will have a second - string right back after @entity66 got sent off so why not put @entity44 out there ? he is excellent in the middle but just as comfortable playing wide			0
@entity49 ’s best position is through the middle , not out on the left			1
defensive duties : @entity49 attempts to block a cross by the impressive @entity74 but @entity21 held the upper hand on that flank for much of the match in @entity44 and @entity78 , @entity0 have two unique players			1
@entity44 can play anywhere and even though he did n’t have many minutes , @entity78 came on and did well cutting inside			0
@entity56 has plenty of options but @entity49 is wasted on the wings			2
if he does change it , then @entity84 could be the one to be sacrificed			2
there ’s no doubt he works hard for the team but he does n’t create enough			0
i ’d like to see more from him if he still plays			0
sacrifice : @entity84 could be the one to make way when @entity0 play @entity61 on thursday perfection from @entity94 95.4 % - @entity94 's pass completion rate against @entity0 in @entity53 , the best of any midfielder on the pitch			1
@entity94 is my kind of midfielder — he really is the conductor of the orchestra			2
he might be 35 but @entity94 glides across the pitch and makes time stand still when he ’s on the ball			1
he dominated @entity0 at @entity104 with 114 passes before killing them off with his chipped penalty			1
he was at it again on saturday			0
in @entity53 he ‘ only ’ managed 103 passes but it was always the right one			0
wherever he is on the pitch @entity21 look to him because they know he will keep possession and give them all a breather			2
he is a joy to watch and you ’d love to have an @entity118 like him , but players like @entity94 do n’t come along very often			2
midfield masters : @entity0 captain @entity121 congratulates @entity21 's @entity94 after the match @entity123 showing a killer instinct for 70 minutes against @entity21 , @entity123 was causing their defence all sorts of problems			1
he really he can scare opposition defences with his movement			0
he always wants to dribble at people with pace , which is terrifying for any defender but he gets into good positions , too			0
just look at his finish for @entity0 ’s goal			2
it was a great move , started by @entity44 ’s wonderful pass — he ’s more than just a dribbler — and set up by @entity49			0
it was @entity0 at their very best			0
better form : @entity123 continued his scoring streak this season when he converted @entity49 's cross on 37 minutes inch - perfect : @entity49 's cross was right on the boot of @entity123 to turn home and bring @entity0 level at 1 - 1 @entity0 vs @entity21 match facts			1

@entity0 will be unable to compete until they learn to slow down the play in tough conditions
they completed 91 per cent of their passes , but the tempo was too high
@entity49 must return to central role against @entity61 , with @entity84 making way
@entity94 proved he is still the master at 35
@entity123 showed a *brilliant* killer instinct to score against @entity21
