eight competitive rounds to the @entity1 and @entity2 is determined to get back on track after the rude awakening of a rare missed cut at the @entity5 last week			1
‘ sometimes a kick up the backside can do you a world of good , and i want to do well in these next two events , ’ said the world no 1 , who will tee off alongside world no 2 @entity15 and no 3 @entity16 in the @entity17 at @entity18 on thursday			1
the 25 - year - old took advantage of some unexpected time off to take his mum @entity21 out for a birthday treat last friday night before getting down to some serious hard practice over the weekend			2
@entity2 was back in action during a practice round ahead of the @entity17 @entity26 has this event and the @entity28 to hone his game for the masters @entity2 only has the masters left to complete a full set of golf 's grand slam titles ‘ i guess coming off a three - week break you ’re never quite sure how your game is going to be , and i just was n’t comfortable playing the shots i needed to play in the wind , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ now i ’m excited to get back at it and obviously put in a better performance			1
i ’ve worked on those wind shots and i feel in a better place and probably a little more prepared than i was last week			1
’ on monday , @entity2 turned up at the renowned @entity46 club in south @entity47 for their fabled member - guest event			1
he walked through the locker room and studied the names on the winner ’s board			2
men with names like @entity55 and @entity56			2
@entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			2
‘ it would be cool to have my name up there , ’ he thought to himself and well , you can probably guess what happened next			0
the four - time major champion breezed round in 63 and won by two strokes			0
the @entity67 gets lost among the azaleas while playing the @entity1 last season @entity2 got a ' kick up the backside ' by missing the cut at the @entity5 in @entity47 now it is the first @entity73 event of the season featuring every single member of the world ’s top 50			1
‘ i do n’t know whether it ’s important for me to be going to the masters at the top of my form , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i ’ve won majors when not playing well leading up to them			2
but i know one thing for sure			0
i ’d much rather be going there with a win or a good performance under my belt			0
’ when he has finished here , @entity2 will head up to @entity89 with his dad @entity90 before playing his final competitive event ahead of his first tilt at a career grand slam			1
that event will be at the @entity28 at @entity96			0
@entity2 was not the only one to leave @entity97 last week determined to make amends here			1
how about @entity99 , who bossed a good field in terms of shotmaking but squandered a golden opportunity to claim his first strokeplay triumph on @entity106 soil ? @entity107 hero @entity99 announces he will be hosting the @entity109 masters in october the @entity109 masters will be staged at @entity110 in association with @entity112 @entity99 put no fewer than five balls into the water during his final round to miss out on the sudden death play - off by a stroke			1
now he finds himself on a course laden with so many water hazards it is known as the @entity121			0
any prospect of a watery hangover , therefore ? the ever - confident one gave short shrift to the notion			0
‘ do you think i will have suddenly developed a phobia for water ? ’ he asked , aghast			0
i ’m holding a bottle of water for heaven ’s sake ! ‘ honestly , i could n’t care less there ’s water everywhere			0
this is a course where you ’ve got to hit your targets and yes , if you miss them and hit bad shots then chances are that your ball is going to finish up wet			0
‘ but i ’m going into this tournament having led the field last week in greens in regulation and shots that finished closest to the hole			2
‘ yes , it ’s a tournament i should have won and i ’m devastated in some ways that i did n’t			0
but i have n’t spent the time since wallowing on the sofa or worrying about the three or four loose shots that cost me			0
@entity99 found the water no less than five times as he missed out on a play off at the @entity5 @entity99 insists he has put the slump behind him and is fitter than ever heading into the @entity73 at @entity18 ‘ time to move on and enjoy the fact i ’m fitter than i ’ve been for some time			1
i did some tests last week and the strength in my shoulder area is 75 per cent greater than last year , when i was struggling with injuries			2
no , it does n’t mean i ’m going to hit the ball 75 per cent further but it does mean i ’m going to be able to cope better with the rigours of a long season and be able to hit the number of practice balls on the range that i want to			0
’ @entity99 was speaking at the official announcement that he will be the host when the @entity109 masters , with @entity112 as presenting sponsor , is relaunched in october			1
if that welcome development sounds familiar , it is because @entity177 broke the news last november			0
as we revealed back then , @entity99 will be followed in future years as host by @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 .			1

@entity2 missed the cut at the @entity5 , @entity47 last week
@entity26 is back playing at the @entity17 in @entity18
