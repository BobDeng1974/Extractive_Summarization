when it comes to getting something for nothing , one man from @entity1 thought he was the master			0
always on the lookout for a deal , @entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , spotted an offer for the on - demand limo and taxi service , @entity13 that would see him receive $ 20 in ride credit for each person that signed up			1
by referring friends and cleverly forwarding a referral link to various deals and coupon code websites , he was able to rack up $ 50,000 in credit for future car rides			1
creative : @entity24 , who works at a @entity1 - based real estate startup signed up so many people to @entity13 he earned $ 50,000 in credits almost everyone 's private driver : @entity24 credit was canceled and his account was flagged after he gave one driver a one - star review all @entity34 riders know they can get a free $ 20 credit toward future rides by signing up their friends , but it is safe to say , even someone as popular as mr @entity24 did n't have 2,500 friends			1
he posted his @entity34 credit code on a @entity44 site for people looking for cut - price deals			1
his referral link became so popular that if someone searched for ' @entity50 ' or something similar on @entity52 , his link would be the one that users would sign up			2
he believes more than 90 % of the several thousand people that signed up came from his link			2
speaking to @entity58 , mr @entity24 defended his get - free - rides - quick scheme			1
' i think my actions were appropriate			0
did i violate any of their guidelines out right ? no. did i walk a fine line ? perhaps			0
i brought them new business that they never had before			0
i saved them tens of thousands on customer acquisition and generated a huge amount of new revenue			0
' although clearly frustrated at the loss of $ 50,000 , mr @entity24 says he does n't intend to sue			1
' instead of taking it all away , they should have taken back the credit earned from practices they deemed inappropriate and let me keep what was rightfully mine			0
' common knowledge : uber riders know they can get a free $ 20 credit toward future rides by signing up their friends for the on - demand limo and taxi service deceptive ? @entity13 declined to comment on @entity7 ' claim , but pointed us to the company 's credit policy , which requires users to actually know the friends they 're signing up for the mobile app new @entity34 members were enticed further to use the code as they each received $ 45 ride credit of their own			1
strangers are encouraged to use someone else 's referral code to join			2
within a matter of weeks , he had racked up enough ride credit to take care of every need			0
' @entity13 for life , essentially , ' he told @entity107			1
however , mr @entity24 life in the back seat all came to a grinding halt eight weeks after he began enjoying the hi - life when his account was flagged by the account integrity department at @entity34			1
mr @entity24 , who works at a @entity1 - based real estate startup , believes it occurred after he left a driver a bad review			1
' i rated a driver one star because he took a terrible route and wasted 30 minutes			0
that review was probably flagged in the system , which led to a community manager to review the ride , and consequently my account			2
they noticed how high my credits were and froze my account			2
they informed me that i earned credit inappropriately and my account / credit was suspended			2
' ' of course i wished i would have stopped and stayed under the radar with $ 50k in credits			0
but at the time , it was too easy and i thought i was doing everything legitimately			0
i think they would have eventually caught on			0
' @entity13 cancelled his credit and wrote him the following curt message : our system has flagged your account indicating you ’ve taken advantage of the @entity34 referral program to earn @entity13 credit inappropriately			1
you will no longer earn credit from invite codes associated with these accounts , and we ’ve removed the credit earned previously from the primary account associated with this invite code			1
good for business : mr @entity24 believes that more than 2,500 signed up to @entity13 under his referral code and he should still be earning credits as a result but he has been blocked from doing so entrepreneur : jareds had posted his @entity34 credit code on a @entity44 site for folks looking for cut - price deals , and many of his 2,500 or so referrals came from there @entity13 declined to comment on @entity7 ' claim , but has restated the company 's credit policy , which requires users to actually know the friends they 're signing up for the mobile app. it prohibits giving away your credit code to strangers : ' public distribution on sites where you are a contributor but not the primary content owner ( e.g. , @entity179 , coupon websites ) is not allowed			1
' mr @entity24 has said that he believed @entity13 should be rewarding him for his ingenuity			1
' i am not happy with their decision to cancel my credit since a great majority was earned within their guidelines			0
on the other hand , they are a mutli - national , multi-billion dollar private company and they can do whatever they want with my account and not have to answer to anyone			2
i brought them 2,500 new uber users			0
they should be thanking me and rewarding me with the credit			0

@entity24 , 23 , realized that more than one person could use his sign - up code for @entity13
he posted it *online* where more than 2,500 people used his code to open @entity34 accounts
@entity13 credited $ 50,000 to his account but then removed it after realizing his scam
