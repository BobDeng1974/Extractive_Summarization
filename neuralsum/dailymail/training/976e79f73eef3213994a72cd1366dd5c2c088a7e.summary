@entity0 claimed @entity2 's poor start to the season was behind @entity5 's decision to pull out of @entity7 's starting line - up against @entity8			1
@entity5 was dropped to the bench and replaced by @entity10 in @entity7 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity8 after admitting he was n't mentally ready to start the @entity13 qualifier			1
the @entity2 forward , still only 19 , came off the bench to win the 74th minute free - kick that led to @entity7 skipper @entity16 scoring his 43rd goal for his country			1
@entity2 's @entity5 was a second - half substitute in @entity8 after admitting he was n't mentally ready here are facts for @entity5 's season so far with club side @entity2 ... games played : 10 minutes played : 854 goals : 3 total shots : 17 shots on target : 12 shooting accuracy : 71 % shot conversion rate : 18 % mins per goal : 285 assists : 2 chances created ( inc. assists ) : 20 passes : 382 passing accuracy : 79 % @entity35 : 48 % @entity0 said : ' there is an awful lot going on in his head			1
perhaps it 's quite simply the season has n't started quite as well for @entity2 as they wanted			1
' he 's player who 's always in the focus and spotlight for @entity7 and @entity2 , maybe that 's had some effect			1
but i do n't know , it 's a theory			2
' in mitigation of a young player , when you break into a team like @entity2 and you have a fantastic season , then you go to the @entity53 and you do well and people regard you as one of the few who lived up to his reputation			2
' then you come back and you 're still only 19 years of age , there are a lot of other things that play a part it people 's make up			0
it is n't quite as simple as the training you 're doing maybe taking some juice from your legs			0
' @entity0 claimed @entity5 is one of the biggest talents in @entity70 football after the @entity53 , but the decision to withdraw him from the team to start in @entity73 is highly unusual			1
the @entity7 substitutes watch on in @entity8 as @entity5 ( second right ) was rested from the starting line - up @entity76 makes way for @entity5 in the second - half in @entity73 despite revealing he felt fatigued of the players @entity7 used against @entity8 , only @entity79 has played more minutes this season than @entity5 ... @entity79 1164 minutes played @entity5 1079 mins @entity82 1064 mins @entity76 1035 mins @entity83 995 mins @entity84 990 mins @entity85 990 mins @entity86 919 mins @entity87 836 mins @entity16 758 mins @entity88 741 mins @entity10 538 mins @entity5 played just 45 minutes of @entity7 's 5 - 0 victory over @entity90 at @entity91 on thursday night and @entity0 claimed at the time that he looked to the head coach in the dressing room to say ' why me ? '			1
less than 48 hours later @entity0 revealed that @entity5 approached him after a warm up at @entity96 on saturday morning to tell him that he was not in the right mental state to play			1
@entity0 said : ' people do n't like it when you simplistically tell the truth			2
we were training at @entity103 doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically			0
' just before we started , @entity5 had done the warm up and he came to me and said '' look i really am feeling a bit tired , i 'm not in my best form at the moment because i am feeling a bit tired ''			2
' so i said best thing is @entity10 starts the game and you rest and i have got you to bring on from the bench , simple as that			0
@entity5 's @entity2 team - mate @entity10 started in his place and put in a solid performance in @entity73 ' as you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he is n't suffering from anything			1
' it was a question of having two players , who both did pretty well against @entity90 and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded , the other one is full of beans			0
' we 'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve			0
' i think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they 're 100 per cent when they are n't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity			0
i thought @entity10 had a good game			0
' @entity5 told @entity0 he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on saturday @entity5 came on and made an impression , but the expectation of the youngster is high after the @entity90 game , @entity0 claimed that the @entity2 forward had been at his best on the night and that there was no cause for concern			1
that had changed by the time he explained the decision to leave @entity5 on the bench until the 63rd minute , when he came on to replace @entity76			2
@entity0 added : ' do n't forget it was two days after quite a difficult game against @entity90			2
it was two days after the game			0
' it was fatigue he had n't managed to shake off after the @entity90 game , it was no more complicated than that			0
is it common ? i do n't really know			0
@entity5 , warming up during the first - half in @entity8 , complained of feeling tired in training @entity5 raises expectations when he gets the ball and perks up the support , despite starting on the bench ' at international level , when there are so many good players trying to get their hands on the shirt , i do n't think you should keep hold of it when maybe you are feeling yourself that you 're not at your best			1
' we have to take players ' welfare into consideration and there are times when top league teams with @entity190 football when players suffer from a physical and mental fatigue			0
' @entity0 has a good working relationship with @entity2 manager @entity194 , but these claims will create tension when @entity5 returns to @entity197 on monday			1
@entity2 manager @entity194 ( right ) might have a different view to @entity0 on @entity5 's fitness @entity200 ( left ) attempts to catch up with @entity5 in the second - half in @entity73 @entity5 is one of @entity2 's best players and it will be down to @entity194 to make sure the forward is in the right frame of mind to face his former side @entity207 on sunday			1
@entity0 added : ' i do n't want to say any more , i do n't want to get drawn			2
if you really want to research that further you 've got to speak to him , people who work with him and his club			0
it was a simple decision			0
' it was good to have him up our sleeve to put on in the last 25 mins and i 'm convinced he 'll have a week now , exactly a week , i 'm pretty sure when he goes back to @entity2 they 'll sort him out and come sunday you 'll see him flying around			0

@entity2 winger @entity5 started @entity8 match on the bench
@entity5 told @entity0 he was tired and was n't in the right mental state
@entity0 claims @entity2 's poor start and expectations could be a factor
@entity5 eventually came on in the second - half as @entity7 won 1 - 0
