she said : ‘ i knew i was n’t one of the skinny girls at school but it never affected me when it came to friends or boyfriends and i was n’t bullied or anything like that			0
‘ as i got older i started to gain more weight but even embarrassing situations , like the time i cracked a sunbed at a tanning salon , did n’t motivate me to lose weight			0
‘ it changed when i had @entity49 , i hated the idea that i might be an embarrassment to her or @entity16			1
‘ they never said anything and i know they loved me whatever my size but i always worried about how my weight impacted on them			2
’ mrs @entity5 , from @entity59 , spent years making excuses not to attend social occasions because she was afraid of embarrassing her husband , and avoided parents ' evenings in case other mothers thought she was a bad parent			1
mrs @entity5 says she was motivated to lose weight by the birth of her daughter , @entity69 , 15			1
she was so embarrassed by her weight that she avoided parents ' evenings for fear people would think her a bad mother mrs @entity5 says that she does not consider herself to be on a diet now - she just ditched the takeaways and only eats fresh , home - cooked food a turning point came when she realised her size also had implications for her long - term health and dying prematurely became a real concern			1
she said : ‘ i ’d sort of accepted that being overweight was my fate			0
i genuinely believed that my weight would be what killed me – which is scary looking back now because i was only 37			0
‘ i used to go to bed at night and wonder if that might be the night i did n’t wake up			0
’ as a result , mrs @entity5 joined a slimming club in march 2010 in a bid to lose weight and save her life			1
she said : ‘ i was totally embarrassed			0
i was terrified i ’d be too big for the scales and even made my friend check with the consultant first , and i worried i ’d be the biggest person there			0
‘ i probably was the biggest but it did n’t matter , everyone was different shapes and sizes but we were all in the same boat and in it together			0
’ mrs @entity5 used to be too afraid of getting stuck in an aeroplane seat to go on foreign holidays			2
she is now looking forward to taking her daughter , @entity17 ( left ) , on the family 's first trip abroad mrs @entity5 was worried that her weight would eventually kill her			1
she feared that one night she would go to sleep and not wake up so she felt that she needed to join a slimming club to save her own life mrs @entity5 ditched the takeaways and ate only fresh food cooked at home			2
she said : ‘ i always say i ’m not on a diet , i just eat healthily now			0
‘ i ’ve got a completely different relationship with food			0
it used to be a battle , but now i know how to eat healthily and that i can still have treats if i want them so there ’s nothing to fight anymore			0
‘ if i want a treat i have it , but i ’ve found that a lot of the time you only want it because you think you ca n’t or should n’t have it			0

at @entity143 someone even described me as a cougar , i could n’t believe they meant me ! ‘ three years ago i never dreamed that i ’d be able to lose the weight , so it ’s hard to believe i ’m not only half the size i was but that i have a whole new career and so much to look forward to			2
‘ life really has begun at 40 for me and i ca n’t wait to get stuck in ! when i went to bed i used to worry whether i ’d wake up or not , now i find it hard to sleep because i ’m thinking about all of the exciting things i ’ve got planned			2
