' the revelation that the @entity1 is actively working with the @entity5 government to promote food stamps for illegal aliens should have a direct impact on the fate of the immigration bill now being debated in @entity28 , ' @entity52 president @entity86 said in a statement			1
' these disclosures further confirm the fact that the @entity59 administration can not be trusted to protect our borders or enforce our immigration laws			0
and the coordination with a foreign government to attack the policies of an @entity2 state is contemptible			0
' @entity86 's group also obtained a march 2010 @entity1 flyer advertising a taxpayer - funded online seminar for nonprofits serving @entity110 communities			1

that letter encouraged staff at those @entity5 diplomatic missions to learn in another webinar how to encourage more of ' the needy families that the consulates serve ' to enroll in the @entity19 program			2
@entity52 said thursday that the 2012 document did not discriminate between legal @entity2 residents and illegal immigrants			2
in august , agriculture under secretary @entity141 rolled out a new range of anti-fraud programs aimed at preventing food stamp funds from going to ineligible recipients			0
' @entity1 has a zero tolerance policy for @entity19 fraud , ' @entity141 said when announcing new measures to clamp down on abuse of the program that he promised would ' help us hold bad actors even more accountable than in the past and discourage them from abusing the public 's trust			2
' the agency 's press release , however , made no mention of efforts intended to deny @entity19 benefits to illegal immigrants			0
people line up for their monthly debt cards and food stamps all over the country former @entity167 governor @entity166 is president @entity59 's secretary of agriculture and is responsible for the @entity19 program 's operation last year @entity173 @entity172 senator @entity172 complained in writing to @entity1 secretary @entity166 that , ' it defies rational thinking for the @entity2 – now dangerously $ 16 trillion in debt – to partner with foreign governments to help us place more foreign nationals on @entity2 welfare			1
' an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the @entity2			0
