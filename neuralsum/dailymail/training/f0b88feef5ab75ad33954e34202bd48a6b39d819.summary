despite capitulating defensively at @entity1 , @entity0 managed to cling on to top spot in the @entity3			1
they now find themselves level on points with @entity7 , with the title race primed to become as keenly - contested as last season			1
but @entity11 's pursuit was n't quite as close as this battle between the champions and @entity15 's @entity14			2
@entity15 could only watch on as @entity0 were beaten 5 - 3 away at @entity1 @entity16 looks on dejected as @entity0 surrendered an early lead at @entity18 @entity19 and @entity20 celebrate as @entity7 beat @entity21 3 - 2 at the @entity22 the pair are not only level on points , but on goals scored , goals conceded , wins , draws and defeats			1
in an astonishing quirk , @entity0 lead the way by alphabetic virtue			2
if this were to be the case at the end of the season , both sides would need to play - off in a one - off clash to determine who lifts the @entity3 crown			1
the match would be played at a neutral venue chosen by the @entity3 board of directors and agreed by both clubs as soon as viable after the season finishes			1
a play - off remains highly unlikely , but would serve as an exciting crescendo for supporters up and down the country			0
the @entity52 rules state : ' if at the end of the season either the @entity3 champions or the clubs to be relegated or the question of qualification for other competitions can not be determined because two or more clubs are equal on points , goal difference and goals scored , the clubs concerned shall play off one or more deciding @entity3 matches on neutral grounds , the format , timing and venue of which shall be determined by the @entity41			2
' captain @entity65 scored a stunning goal for @entity7 against the @entity21 on @entity67 a play - off has never been played before , although league officials did plan for a title - decider between @entity72 and @entity73 at the end of the 1995 - 96 season			1
the match would have taken place on either may 16 or 21 at @entity77 but @entity72 beat @entity78 on the final day of the season and @entity73 drew at @entity1 , leaving the @entity80 four points clear at the top of the table			1
if a play - off were to happen this season a venue away from @entity86 would likely be chosen			0
tickets were printed for a title play - off between @entity72 and @entity73 but the game was n't needed @entity90			0
the position of @entity93 in the table shall be determined by the number of points scored in that season , the club having scored the highest number of points being at the top of the table and the club having scored the lowest number of points being at the bottom			0
if any 2 or more clubs have scored the same number of points their position in the table shall be determined on goal difference , that is to say , the difference between the total number of goals scored by and against a club in @entity117 in that season , and the higher or highest placed @entity101 shall be the club with the higher or highest goal difference			0
if any 2 or more clubs have scored the same number of points and have the same goal difference the higher or highest placed @entity101 shall be the club having scored the most goals in @entity117 in that season			0
subject to rule @entity130 , if any 2 or more clubs have scored the same number of points , have the same goal difference and have scored the same number of goals in @entity117 in that season they shall be deemed to occupy the same position in the table			0
if at the end of the season either the @entity140 or the @entity93 to be relegated or the question of qualification for other competitions can not be determined because 2 or more clubs are equal on points , goal difference and goals scored , the @entity93 concerned shall play off one or more deciding @entity117 on neutral grounds , the format , timing and venue of which shall be determined by the @entity41 .			0
