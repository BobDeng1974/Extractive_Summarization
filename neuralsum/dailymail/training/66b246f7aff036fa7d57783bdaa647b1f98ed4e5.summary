two high - profile woman candidates quit the party in disgust yesterday : @entity19 and @entity20 , who is a human rights barrister			1
principle : human rights barrister @entity20 , left , and high flier @entity19 both resigned from the @entity6 in disgust over the secret courts plan and accuse party leaders of supporting ' unfair bill ' activists applauded when miss @entity19 , who is also a lawyer , announced her resignation on stage at the party conference in @entity32			1
in an emotional speech , she said : ‘ it ’s not me @entity9 , it ’s you ’ , claiming that mr @entity9 had ‘ abandoned liberal values for the privileges of power ’			1
she added : ‘ the leadership of the @entity6 has chosen to ignore party members , ride roughshod over party policy and support this unfair , unnecessary and unbalanced @entity42			2
‘ the leadership has chosen to protect secrets and abuses of power over openness , accountability and freedom			0
i can not support such a leadership			0
’ mr @entity9 made no mention of the row in his keynote speech which brought the conference to a close at lunchtime outside the conference hall , miss @entity19 told the @entity58 : ‘ i love this party , i am dedicated to this party but i can not continue under this leader			1
this bill runs contrary to what we are about ; fair trials and the ability to hold power to account			0
’ a female activist accused miss @entity19 of betraying her party , saying : ‘ i have lost respect for you … resigning like that in the open			1
there will pages of it in the papers tomorrow , saying how rubbish we are			0
’ during an emergency debate yesterday , former @entity78 @entity6 mp , @entity77 , said it was wrong for the government to claim that secret courts would affect only ‘ civil proceedings ’			0
he added : ‘ the @entity42 does nothing to help the secret services gain more information to foil terror plots			0
all it does is give them an unfair advantage in cases where they are accused of kidnap and torture			0
’ emotions also ran high on the issue during a question and answer session with mr @entity9 on saturday			1
three out of ten questions asked concerned secret courts , as delegates became increasingly frustrated with the party leader ’s answers			2
one told him the legislation was ‘ illiberal ’ and warned that members could not support it			2
mr @entity9 said he understood the strong feelings about the issue but it would be impossible to block it in the face of support from the @entity114 and @entity115			1
‘ please do n’t allege that this government , with @entity6 in it , is doing something abhorrently illiberal , which we are not , ’ he insisted			0
the government ’s @entity120 passed its third reading , despite a rebellion by @entity125 mps and a handful of @entity6			1
ministers say civil claims against the state involving terror suspects and armed forces should be held behind closed doors as too often the government pays out millions of pounds to settle claims to prevent secret intelligence from being revealed			0
former @entity125 leadership contender @entity136 said : ‘ @entity137 must be spinning in his grave			0
let ’s be clear – given the majority for secret courts in the @entity143 , it is the @entity6 who have delivered them			0
’ @entity147 , director of @entity148 , said : ‘ @entity19 is a rising political star and a member of the @entity6 federal executive			1
losing her should feel like losing your soul and reflects a loss of human rights values at the top of the party			2
