the scam saw him befriend the victim , whose identity was protected by a judge , over seven years and persuade him to hand over cash for specialist treatment			2
on one occasion , he even arrived at the man ’s home with a bandaged head , claiming to have just had a brain tumour removed			2
when the man became suspicious , @entity6 , who police believe has been known by at least four fake identities and once changed his name by deedpoll , claimed he needed more cash because he was being threatened by gangsters over unpaid loans			1

conman : @entity6 tries to dodge photographers after appearing at @entity70 , @entity71 , last month the hearing was told that his mother was just 15 when she gave birth to him in 1967 , but her parents were so embarrassed that they secretly brought him up in the @entity71 town as their own – allowing him to believe his mother was his sister			1

another scam saw @entity6 pretend to be the manager of a computer firm earning £ 35,000 a year to secure a car loan , while claiming benefits under another false name			1

the pensioner initially went to police , who warned him he might be the victim of a conman , but he decided not to press charges			0
later , @entity6 returned and claimed he needed a further £ 35,000 to release cash from the will of his mother , whom he said had died in a car crash in @entity130			1
