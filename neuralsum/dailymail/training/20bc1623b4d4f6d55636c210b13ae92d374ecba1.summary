by @entity0 in @entity2 , fishermen are busy at work and receiving a helping hand from an unlikely group of companions			0
swimming in circles alongside the fishing boat , two short - haired otters shriek excitedly as they navigate their way through the river which feeds into the @entity12 , the world 's largest mangrove forest			2
the setting is @entity16 , some 130 miles from the @entity18 capital @entity19 , where fishermen drop their net close to the riverbank and one by one , tails up , the animals dive into the water			1
fishermen in @entity18 rely on otters to help them with their daily work			2
the otters diver under water and chase fish into the nets the technique has been used for centuries in the area but the tradition is now dying out in parts of @entity39			1
one fisherman @entity40 said ' our job depends on the otters ' in recent years , once abundant fish are increasingly scarce and when fishermen drag up their nets they are often empty			1
the scarcity of fish within the river has been put down to pollution , over-fishing and pesticides this is a rare technique that has been handed down for centuries in the country but a partnership which has already long died out in other parts of @entity39			2
' our job depends on the otters , ' said @entity40 , a fisherman in his 50s , whose family has trained the animals to help them fish for generations			0
the otters do not catch the fish themselves , instead they chase them towards the fishing net placed next to the boat			2
' the otters manage to spot fish among the plants , then the fish swim away and we stay close with our nets			2
' if we did it without them , we would n't be able to catch as many fish , ' said mr @entity40 ' son @entity79 , standing as he steers the boat along the leafy canal			0
fishing is usually done during the night when the fishermen can expect to catch between four and 12 kilogrammes ( 8.8 and 26 pounds ) of fish , shrimp and crabs			2
over 25 years the number of families involved in otter fishing in the area has dropped from 500 to just 150			1
in 50 years the practice has declined by around 90 per cent ' the otters manage to spot fish among the plants , then the fish swim away and we stay close with our nets , ' said mr @entity40 ' son @entity79 ' if we did it without them , we would n't be able to catch as many fish , ' said mr @entity40 ' son @entity79 , standing as he steers the boat along the leafy canal the family earns around $ 250 ( £ 151 ) a month selling their catch at the local market			1
but in recent years , once abundant fish are increasingly scarce and when fishermen drag up their nets they are often empty			2
' the kinds of fish we used to find with our father , we do n't see here anymore , ' said @entity79			0
natural fish populations have reduced drastically in recent years , said @entity114 , a zoology professor at @entity19 's @entity115 , because ' the fish simply can not breed			2
' ' @entity117 , water pollution from oil and the use of pesticides in ( rice ) paddy fields , as well as overcatching are all having an impact , ' mr @entity114 said			1
fishing is usually done during the night when the fishermen can expect to catch between four and 12 kilogrammes ( 8.8 and 26 pounds ) of fish , shrimp and crabs otters swim alongside the fishermen , busy at work finding fish in the river in @entity16 , some 120 miles from the capital @entity19 farmers spend half of their monthly wage of £ 150 feeding their companions mr @entity114 has been studying otter fishing in @entity2 for 25 years			1
over this period , the number of families involved has dropped from 500 to just 150			1
' go back 50 years and the practice has declined by about 90 per cent , ' he said			0
if the trend continues , he believes otter fishing will be ' completely wiped out ' within the next two decades			1
@entity149 still in his 20s , fisherman @entity79 is equally pessimistic			0
' if there are no fish , then there 's no point in having the otter fishing system , ' he said			1
' just look at my family 's situation			0
my brothers and sisters , they all want to study			0
they do n't want to get into the river and catch fish			0
due to over-fishing and pollution , the river is now experiencing a shortage of fish			0
the number of families in the fishing industry in the local area has decreased from 500 to 150 in 25 years wildlife experts fear it is not only the livelihoods of the fishing families that are under threat			1
short - haired otters are an endangered species in @entity2 and otter fishing plays a key role in their conservation , according to mr @entity114 ' if they study then they will obviously move out of the village to find better jobs or they will buy fish from the wholesale and sell them , ' he added			1
he worries that his only source of income will soon no longer be profitable			0
each month almost half of his earnings are spent on feeding his five otters -- two fully trained adults and three young apprentices -- who consume 3 - 4 kilogrammes ( 6 - 9 pounds ) of fish a day			1
and wildlife experts fear it is not only the livelihoods of the fishing families that are under threat			0
short - haired otters are an endangered species in @entity2 and otter fishing plays a key role in their conservation , according to mr @entity114			1
' the captive population here is very healthy because of the fishing , ' he said			0
sometimes fishermen release otters into the wild which strengthens that population , research shows			0
' but as the practice gradually decreases , the wild population will face increased pressure , ' he added .			0

fishermen in @entity16 , 130 miles from capital @entity19 , use the otters to lure fish into their nets
in 25 years the number of families otter fishing has dropped from 500 to 150
expert @entity224 fears that if the trend continues otter fishing will be ' wiped out ' within 20 years
the fishermen spend around half of their £ 150 earnings each month buying feed for the otters
rivers in the area are now short of fish because of water pollution and overcatching
