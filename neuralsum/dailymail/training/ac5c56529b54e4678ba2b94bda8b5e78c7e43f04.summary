@entity0 has moved to the @entity1 to begin his pre-season training regime with his personal trainer in tow			1
the @entity6 striker , prevented from working with his team - mates because of his four - month ban from ' all football activity ' , wants to be fit for the new season as soon as possible			2
he is hoping that when the @entity12 hear his appeal , in the second week of august , they reduce his ban and he can join @entity16 's men fit for the new season			0
it is the same place that @entity36 chose to go to in october 2012 , when he went with a physiotherapist			0
training at altitude will also benefit @entity0 's fitness when he returns to @entity6			2
furthermore , he has been advised by his lawyers to stay out of the spotlight and so training away from media and supporters in the @entity1 will allow him to do just that			0
his legal team are anxious to ensure that @entity46 do not think he is contravening their sanctions			0
@entity0 hired the personal trainer himself , without any assistance from @entity6 , as per @entity46 rules			1
he is not allowed a coach linked either to his club or his national team			2
even if @entity0 's ban for biting @entity56 during the @entity57 is not reduced , both he and the club hope that it will at least be relaxed enough for the @entity58 to join in with @entity6 training			0
his team - mates are currently training at @entity61 in @entity62 ahead of their pre-season campaign which starts against @entity64 on saturday week			1
@entity6 players including @entity67 train at @entity61 on wednesday put your left leg in : @entity6 's @entity71 ( right ) and @entity72 stretch during a training session @entity74 is one of world 's best - @entity72 pretty in pink : @entity6 are spending time at @entity61 without their new signing @entity0 not fooling anyone : @entity0 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity56 cover up ! @entity0 holds his face to suggest that he had only collided with the @entity84 defender			1
