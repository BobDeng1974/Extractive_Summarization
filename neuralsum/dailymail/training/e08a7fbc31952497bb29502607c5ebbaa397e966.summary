for a man so incredibly quick with his feet , @entity0 was hardly rushing to follow his father into the family business			1
banana farming in the plantation surrounding his home in @entity9 was one outcome he desperately wanted to avoid			1
‘ it ’s hard , hard work , ’ says the @entity12 winger			1
‘ long days and hard			2
for sure , that would be me now if i did not play football			2
‘ i worked in the farms for a while but i was lazy			2
i just wanted to play football			2
always , all i wanted was football			2
@entity38 midfielder @entity37 is also among the players named			2
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we have had no contact from any authority regarding this matter			1
’ it ’s what he would say to the teachers who confronted him over his truancy			2
and to one of his early clubs , which he left after four days because they insisted on 5am alarm calls to kick - start a series of daily chores			2
it ’s also what he said to the numerous suggestions that he was just too small to be any good			2
‘ i had the same hormone treatment as @entity62 when i was young , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ i ’d probably be 10cm smaller if i did n’t			0
’ at 5ft 7ins and 25 years old , the little boy from @entity9 has grown up in a number of ways			1
going into saturday ’s match against @entity67 , @entity0 has emerged as one of @entity12 ’s biggest threats			1
his demolition of @entity71 was central to @entity73 ’s defeat at the @entity74 last month ; his match - up against @entity77 ’s @entity76 in september ’s @entity79 fixture was even more one - sided			2
@entity12 's @entity0 ( right ) challenges @entity73 's @entity71 at the @entity74 last month there were also prolonged moments against @entity83 ’s @entity82 , @entity85 ’s @entity84 and @entity27 ’s @entity86 when the first impression was underlined — he is a fantastically entertaining left winger who , on form , can turn games			1
his deliveries require work , but his pace , feints and flair make him one of the most effective dribblers in the @entity96			1
the statistics show he has four assists in 11 starts — most recently against @entity100 this month — and on average will beat a man three times a game , the sixth highest tally in the @entity96 behind @entity106			1
it is why he has seemingly overtaken @entity108 in the @entity12 pecking order in the past six weeks and why , in @entity9 , they call him ‘ turbine ’			1
‘ i have always liked to run at defenders , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ it is a part of the game i love			0
my family name is @entity0 , my mother ’s name is @entity118 so some people at home call me a @entity121			1
’ home for @entity0 is @entity124 , a city of 153,000 people in the centre of @entity9			1
agriculture is the main industry and bananas are the family trade			0
@entity0 in action for @entity9 at the 2014 @entity132 against @entity133 in @entity134 last june his house is down a long , narrow dirt path in the heart of one of the plantations			1
‘ i come from a very modest family , ’ @entity0 says , speaking via a translator in his first major interview in @entity142			1
‘ my family have always worked really hard			0
they have always worked in agriculture			0
my dad was on the farm and my mother was in the home			0
‘ i have a brother and a sister but they do n’t play football			0
my dad used to play with me when i was little and he tells me his father used to play for @entity156 in @entity9			1
‘ in school all i wanted was football			0
i used to get grants for schooling because of my football in the local teams , but i used to turn up maybe 10 days per month and the teachers would get unhappy and say , “ stop playing all this football			0
you need to study because football is not going to give you anything ”			0
‘ i used to pass every year but football was what i wanted			2
i watched football whenever i could — i used to like @entity73			0
@entity170 scores a penalty for @entity73 during a @entity175 match against @entity176 in 2005 ‘ my dad used to support me			0
my mum was complaining that i should n’t choose football but i always wanted to play only football			0
’ it was that mindset that led him to quit a club as a 16 - year - old			1
‘ i was at a team in @entity9 and they used to wake up at 5am to work and only afterwards would we play football , ’ he says			1
‘ we would spend hours cleaning			0
after four days i told them i was leaving and i went to @entity188 , a big team in @entity9			1
‘ it is a big rival of @entity156 , who my dad supports			0
he said : “ do not go there ” but when i was 16 i realised i could do something with football			0
’ from @entity188 , @entity0 joined @entity23 in the @entity9 second division and then went on loan to a @entity199 side before heading for @entity200 in @entity33 in 2009			1
@entity0 ( right ) , then at @entity200 , chases @entity156 's @entity62 ( left ) during a @entity202 match in 2010 ‘ in my first - team debut , i came on as a substitute for @entity170			1
i used to watch him so closely and then i was coming on for him			0
it was very strange but amazing			0
‘ i also played with @entity206 for a couple of years and i never knew what foot was his strong foot			0
he was amazing with both			0
’ @entity0 went on loan to @entity35 and @entity210 before joining @entity211 in @entity199 in 2012 and almost headed to a different part of @entity213 a year later			1
‘ i was close to joining @entity214 , ’ he says			0
‘ i was desperate to come to the @entity96 but everything happens for a reason			1
maybe the reason was i had to be at @entity12			2
‘ i am grateful @entity214 wanted to sign me			0
it was not a decision from me ( to turn @entity214 down ) and i do n’t think it was a decision from @entity214			0
it was a decision from my ex-agent			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) and @entity73 's @entity33 midfielder @entity206 vie for the ball at the @entity224 last month @entity0 stayed in @entity199 and went on to start all three of @entity9 ’s @entity132 games before finally getting his move to the @entity96 for £ 4m this summer			1
‘ @entity227 from @entity38 told me this was the best league and i love it , ’ he says			0
‘ after going to the @entity132 as well i would say this is maybe my best year			1
i play great players every week			0
( @entity232 ) @entity231 was probably the hardest full back – he was very clever			0
‘ i have been able to help my family which has always been my dream			0
my father does n’t have to work any more			2
’ the banana industry ’s loss has been @entity12 ’s gain .			1

@entity0 has emerged as one of @entity12 's biggest threats
the @entity9 is one of the best dribblers in the @entity96
@entity0 used to work in the banana plantations in @entity9
the 25 - year - old started all three @entity132 games in @entity134 last summer
