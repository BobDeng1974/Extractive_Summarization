you could have heard a pin drop			0
' it took about a minute for me to begin breathing , and @entity13 ’s face went so pale			2
' but after the initial shock , of course we are delighted			0
we ’ve been told we ’re having girls , so @entity13 and @entity28 are definitely about to get very outnumbered at home			1
' they say your second baby is easier to cope with than your first , but since our first and second came at the same time , we ’re hoping babies three and four are a breeze			2
' as far as i know , i ’m the youngest mum in @entity3 to have two sets of twins			2
' miss @entity11 said she always wanted another baby after @entity27 and @entity28 were born in april 2011 so was delighted when she realised in january she was pregnant again			1

my face dropped ' - @entity13 ' but we never wanted a big family			1
last year i said to @entity13 that i wanted another baby , and then we ’d stop			2
i guess good things come in twos			0

for the last part of her pregnancy , the 21 - year - old will be forced to use crutches to get around			2
she said : ' spd is horrible			0
i ’m in constant pain and it ’s making looking after @entity28 and @entity27 so much harder			1
' but it should go away once the babies are born , so i ’ll have them to tire me out instead			0
' her husband - to - be , said : ' it was a right shock when we were told @entity7 was carrying twins			1

scans of the couple 's second set of twins , who are due in less than eight weeks @entity27 and @entity28 , pictured at 19 days old , at their home in @entity75 , @entity129 ' i ’ll always work as much and as hard as i can to support my family - i ca n’t understand why other fathers would n’t			1
i just hope we do n’t have any more			0
' @entity133 , director for @entity134 at the @entity34 , said : ' i have been a midwife for over 30 years and have never seen someone at such a young age have two sets of twins in succession like this			0
' as a mother of twins myself i know what she is going through and i wish her well in her pregnancy			0
' women having twins and multiple births are monitored closely throughout the pregnancy particularly when it is a teenage pregnancy			0
' the experience gained with her first set of twins will be helpful when she gives birth second time round			2
' the important point is that she gets the right levels of support from the midwives and local maternity services throughout the pregnancy and also postnatally along with support from her partner and family			0
' midwives are very skilled at supporting women with multiple pregnancy but do so in partnership with obstetricians			0
