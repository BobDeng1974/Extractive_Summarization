eighteen months ago , @entity0 arrived in @entity1 as a one - fight @entity3 novice			1
he left a bona fide star - albeit a limping one after the @entity5 tore his cruciate ligament in his knee during his victory over @entity9			1
on sunday , he will clamber into the same @entity10 against veteran @entity12 @entity11 , knowing he is just one win away from a title shot			1
@entity0 is back in @entity1 as he headlines a @entity3 show for the first time against @entity11 @entity0 works out at a media and fans session at the @entity3 gym in @entity1 , three days before the fight @entity0 has become known for his unique fighting style , here he demonstrates a kick ' now i 'm on taxis and billboards and the sides of buses out here so that 's one thing that 's changed , ' @entity0 told @entity28			1
' i 'm getting noticed a lot more in @entity30			0
the fan base here seems to be growing at a rapid pace			0
' if i step back and look at the journey i 've been on and i see how far i 've come , i just enjoy it			0
' in my imagination , i always had everything but now it 's transforming into reality			2
it 's becoming more difficult to figure out the difference between imagination and reality , they appear to be one and the same			0
' after almost a year on the sidelines , @entity0 returned last summer with successive first round stoppages of first @entity47 and then @entity48			1
@entity0 's last visit to @entity1 saw him outpoint @entity9 but he left with a serious injury after almost a year on the sidelines , @entity0 returned to beat @entity47 in front of his home fans @entity0 then dispatched @entity48 in equally stunning fashion in the first round in @entity56 ' i came back from a career threatening injury and things have been going so well for me , ' @entity0 added			1
' i 'm taken aback every day by it but i control it , embrace it and i move on			0
everything has gone smoothly ; i focus on what goes right and everything else will go right			0
' @entity0 , 26 , has been outspoken about his next opponent , particularly in regard to @entity70 's failed drug test last april for which he was slapped with a nine - month ban			1
' ' i could easily have sat out and waited for mid-summer and fought for the belt , ' @entity0 said			2
' but as a man who loves competition , i asked for a fight			0
' i am not the person who picks the opponent at the end of the day			0
he [ @entity70 ] was in the frame before the @entity48 fight even took place			1
' after that i was the no 1 contender , i did not have to compete again			0
@entity0 has shown little respect to @entity70 ( right ) ahead of their main event clash at the @entity87 ' they went down the line of the top featherweights , everyone else had been matched but @entity11 had n't			1
' i do not think he deserves it but he got lucky			0
when the door shuts and the bell rings , his luck will run out			0
' @entity0 has long predicted a stoppage within two minutes on sunday , a result that would lead to an early summer clash with featherweight champion @entity99 , possibly in front of 80,000 fans at @entity102 in @entity5			2
' anytime i can bring the @entity3 back to @entity104 , it is motivation for me , ' he added			2
' it will be a historic event to fight for the title on home soil			2
' @entity0 is on track for a title fight against featherweight champion @entity99 at @entity102 in may			1

@entity0 takes on @entity11 in the main event on sunday
his last visit to @entity1 saw him beat @entity9 in his second @entity3 fight
since then @entity0 beat first @entity47 and then @entity48
victory against @entity70 will set him up for a title shot against @entity99
