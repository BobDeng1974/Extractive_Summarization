however , i had pains in my chest and was very out of breath whenever i used it			1
' i tried walking but even this left me breathless and in pain			2
i felt absolutely lost and could n't find a way to help myself so i made an appointment to see my gp			1
' my doctor , dr @entity44 , explained i was putting too much stress on my body			2
