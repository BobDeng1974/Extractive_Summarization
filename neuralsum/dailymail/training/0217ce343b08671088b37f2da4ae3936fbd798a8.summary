a bitter spat between former prime ministers @entity1 and @entity3 over who was most responsible for the success of @entity6 in the late 1980s , shows no sign of ending			1
the latest saga in this simmering feud , which has been running for nearly 30 years , involves mr @entity1 's recent appearance on @entity14 's @entity13 story and contributions by cabinet colleagues of the time			1
mr @entity3 takes aim at @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 for their rosy view of mr @entity1 's prime ministership			1
it 's this way , no it 's not			0
@entity1 and @entity3 were a formidable combination as prime minister and treasurer after @entity6 was returned to power in 1983			1
the partnership ended in 1991 when @entity31 was toppled by @entity3 in a party room challenge for the top job at odds			1
@entity1 and @entity3 have had very different points of view on just who was most responsible for @entity6 's significant success while in power during the 1980s @entity3 ( left ) and @entity1 served as treasurer and prime minister from 1983 until 1991 in an era considered one of @entity6 's most successful in government as far apart as ever			1
@entity1 was pictured next to @entity44 at the @entity45 and @entity3 alongside @entity46 he also dismisses as a ' tawdry hagiography ' a book written by mr @entity1 's wife @entity49 in 2010			2
' as he often does , he uses relatives , friends and colleagues to do the rebutting for him , ' mr @entity3 said of mr @entity1 in the @entity13			2
mr @entity3 argues mr @entity1 was a lucky prime minister , as well as a good one			0
but he uses published accounts of the time , including by ms @entity49 , to back his argument that mr @entity1 was paralysed by inertia in the years following a traumatic personal issue involving his daughter in 1984			0
one of the few occasions in which @entity3 and @entity31 have been pictured together was following a @entity60 for former @entity62 premier @entity61 in @entity63 on may 1st this year @entity46 and @entity3 are pictured chatting at the @entity45 @entity1 greets @entity44 at last week 's @entity45 mr @entity3 says no word would have been uttered by him about those ' vanishing ' years , had mr @entity1 not distorted history in his own memoir			2
' but @entity1 , as he often does , overdid it - he baited me one time too often , ' he said			0
' and no apologia by his mates , no matter how well meant or sentimental , can change the truth that obtained at the core of his government 's management			0
' both @entity3 and @entity31 received rousing receptions inside and outside of the @entity76 at last week 's @entity77 but arguably the biggest cheer was reserved for @entity44 .			0

30 years on the @entity3 - @entity1 spat takes another bitter twist
@entity3 has taken a shot at former cabinet colleagues @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 for supporting @entity31 's *version* of events
@entity3 was made treasurer when @entity6 came into power under @entity1 in 1983
he successfully *unseated* @entity31 in a party room challenge in late 1991 to take over as @entity92 , a position he held until 1996
