by @entity0 published : 15:41 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 07:36 est , 22 may 2013 teenagers are turning away from @entity3 because of oversharing friends and concerns over their parents knowing what they are up to			1
a major new study found they are turning to @entity10 and services like @entity12 in increasing numbers - where they are sharing more personal information about themselves than ever before			1
researchers found a big increase in the number of ' selfies ' being posted , along with information about their school , city and even their mobile phone number			1
the research also looked at what teens were posting online - and found photos of themselves and other personal information was the most popular teens told researchers there were too many adults on @entity3 and too much sharing of teenage angst and inane details like what a friend ate for dinner			1
' the key is that there are fewer adults , fewer parents and just simply less complexity and less drama , ' said @entity45 of the @entity46 , one of the study 's authors			0
' they still have their @entity3 profiles , but they spend less time on them and move to places like @entity10 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
' in the latest poll , 94per cent of teens who are social media users have a profile on @entity3 — flat from the previous year			1
@entity61 discussions with teens show that they have waning enthusiasm for @entity3 , the researchers said , but they keep using it because participation is an important part of overall teenage socializing			1
the concerns come amid growing fears in the city that ' @entity3 fatigue ' is setting in among users , and recent figures show that 40 per cent of young @entity3 users in the @entity76 say that they expect to use the site less this year than they have in the past			1
' one of the most frequent conversations i have with investors is about whether the younger demographic is disengaging from @entity3 , ' says @entity85 , internet analyst at @entity86 , recently told the @entity87 ' they believe that it is happening			1
' focus groups carried out as part of the research found why teens are leaving @entity3			1
here is what they said : female ( age 19 ) : ' yeah , that 's why we go on @entity10 and @entity54 [ instead of @entity3 ]			1
my mom does n't have that			0
' female ( age 15 ) : ' if you are on @entity3 , you see a lot of drama			2
' female ( age 14 ) : ' ok , here 's something i want to say			0
i think @entity3 can be fun , but also it 's drama central			1
on @entity3 , people imply things and say things , even just by a like , that they would n't say in real life			2
' male ( age 18 ) : ' it ’s because [ @entity3 ] it 's where people post unnecessary pictures and they say unnecessary things , like saying he has a girlfriend , and a girl will go on and tag him in the picture like , me and him in the sun having fun			1
why would you do that ? ' female ( age 15 ) : ' i have two [ @entity3 ] accounts			1
one for my family , one for my friends			0
' female ( age 16 ) : ' and so now i am basically dividing things up			0
@entity54 is mostly for pictures			0
@entity10 is mostly for just saying what you are thinking			2
@entity3 is both of them combined so you have to give a little bit of each			2
but yes , so @entity54 , i posted more pictures on @entity54 than on @entity3			2
' female ( age 15 ) : ' i have a @entity3 , a @entity55 , and @entity10			1
i do n’t use @entity3 or @entity10 much			1
i rather use @entity55 to look for interesting stories			0
i like @entity55 because i do n’t have to present a specific or false image of myself and i do n’t have to interact with people i do n’t necessarily want to talk to			0
' 60 % of teen @entity3 users keep their profiles private , and most report high levels of confidence in their ability to manage their settings			1
the typical teen @entity3 user has 300 friends , while the typical teen @entity10 user has 79 followers			1
the @entity46 report found twenty - six per cent of teen social media users were on @entity10			1
that 's more than double the figure in 2011 of 12per cent			2
socially needier : a new poll finds that teens are moving increasingly to @entity10 to avoid their parents and the ' oversharing ' that they see on @entity3 in what is likely a concern to parents , more than 60 per cent of the teens with @entity10 accounts said their tweets were public , meaning anyone on @entity10 — friend , foe or stranger — can see what they write and publish			1
about one - quarter of kids said their tweets were private and 12per cent said they did not know whether their tweets were public or private			2
' teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they did in the past , ' the researchers warned			1
' @entity10 holds a different kind of attraction as an alternative or supplement to @entity3 , ' the researchers say			1
additionally , focus group participants saw the 140 - character limit as preventing the type of excesses found on @entity3			1
male ( age 18 ) : ' @entity3 does n't have a limit to characters on it			2
so in @entity10 , there 's only so much you can say			2
on @entity3 , they say so many details of things that you do n't want to know			2
you 'd be like , are you serious ? no one really cares that much			0
' male ( age 16 ) : ' a lot of friends convinced me to make a @entity10			2
because everyone 's saying @entity3 's dead			1
' female ( age 15 ) : ' i mean , i could just tweet forever			0
there 's no limit on my tweets			0
cause on @entity10 like i express myself more , but at the same time , and like i said , i just do my thing			2
' female ( age 13 ) : ' like , sometimes you just like express your feelings [ on @entity10 ]			2
like you feel like yourself			0
' female ( age 15 ) : ' i 'm on @entity10 more often , and it 's easier			2
i mean @entity3 is easy since i know how to do it , but @entity10 is i think more addictive			1
' female ( age 13 ) : ' on @entity10 you like , get to say whatever you want , and you tweet it			0
but there 's like a limit to what you tweet and everything			0
but whatever you tweet it 's like random things of what 's on your mind			0
and like she said , like , you could express yourself			0
' ' for the five different types of personal information that we measured in both 2006 and 2012 , each is significantly more likely to be shared by teen social media users in our most recent survey			1
' however the researchers also found teens were aware of the security settings of the services they use			2
' teens take other steps to shape their reputation , manage their networks , and mask information they do n’t want others to know ; 74 % of teen social media users have deleted people from their network or friends list , ' they say			1

the researchers surveyed 802 parents and their 802 teens			0
the poll was conducted between july 26 and september 30 , 2012 , on landline and cell phones			0
' a popular new application brought up repeatedly in the focus groups is @entity12 , an image - messaging app where sent pictures and videos are displayed for only several seconds and then are deleted , ' the researchers said			0
' the primary attraction of @entity12 is its central feature , the limited time a recipient sees a picture or video			0
@entity61 participants reported using this feature to send silly or embarrassing pictures			0
' female ( age 13 ) : ' and [ @entity12 ] it ’s really fast like if you sent it over a text it takes like two minutes to load			0
' female ( age 16 ) : ' yeah , [ @entity12 ] it 's faster			0
and you can use @entity12 at school with the school 's website - because i have the basic phone , i use my @entity310			0
” female ( age 13 ) : ' [ @entity12 ] it 's really great			0
i have to admit , it 's better because i could pick the most embarrassing photo , and know that they 'll [ the recipient will ] see it for 10 seconds , and then i 'm done			0
' female ( age 17 ) : ' and it 's just kind of fun			0
because it 's like texting , but you get to use your face as the emoticon instead of an actual emoticon			0
' female ( age 16 ) : ' well , because @entity3 , everyone sees what i 'm doing			0
but @entity12 is just to one person , unless they 're a jerk and they screenshot it and post it on @entity3			0
but mostly it 's just the person that you 're sending it to , so it 's like a conversation			0
