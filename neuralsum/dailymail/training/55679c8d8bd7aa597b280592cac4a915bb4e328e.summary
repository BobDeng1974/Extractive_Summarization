by @entity0 most of us hit our thirties and begin to fret about the onset of the signs of aging : the wrinkles , the greying hair , the cellulite , the saggy bottoms			2
but grandmother @entity11 is already 47 and none of these predictable side effects have happened			1
and she really wishes they would			2
the mother - of - four says she is constantly being mistaken for a woman half her age , and @entity11 , a market stall worker from @entity19 , says looking like a 20 - year - old is actually ruining her life - and now she 's thinking about having cosmetic surgery to make herself look older			1
@entity11 , 47 , hates being mistaken for a woman half her age and wishes she looked the same age as her friends ' everyone wants to look younger but i 'm not joking or exaggerating when i say looking young is ruining my life ' @entity11 says that her youthful looks have ruined a marriage and two long - term relationships , as younger men constantly chat her up			1
she also believes jealous friends have abandoned her because she makes them look older			2
her eldest son , who has recently become a father , hates being seen with her after being mistaken for her boyfriend			1
now size eight @entity11 fears her youthful looks will mean a lifetime of loneliness because she only ever gets chatted up by toyboys she has nothing in common with			1
she says : ' everyone wants to look younger but i 'm not joking or exaggerating when i say looking young is ruining my life			1
i would do anything for a few wrinkles to look my age			2
' why i have none is a mystery to me but the older i get , the bigger the problem becomes for me			2
i need someone to invent the reverse of @entity52 because i 'm desperate to look older			2
' @entity11 married her first husband at the age of 24 , but within a few years they were bickering over her looks			1
she said : ' i was in my late twenties but my husband noticed much younger men looking at me and he started to get jealous			1
' i was n't interested , but as the years passed i remained looking the same age and he looked older , which led to even more rows			2
' we were the same age but he hated people thinking he 'd married a younger woman so i did my best to dress older			1
' @entity11 - second from right , on a night out with friends - says she is forced to socialise with people in their twenties so she looks the same age as them @entity11 used to enjoy shopping trips with eldest son @entity74 , left with his baby , but he got fed up of his mum being mistaken for his girlfriend eventually it drove them apart			1
and despite having two sons together - @entity74 , now 25 , and 19 - year - old @entity82 - they got divorced when @entity11 , who also does some work as a tv extra , was 32			1
four years later , she embarked on a long - term relationship with her second partner , who worked for the @entity87			1
he was just two years older than @entity11 who , at 36 , was often taken for a twenty - something			1
she says : ' at first he loved it and complimented me on my appearance			2
he said he was proud to be with me			2
' but soon the looks from younger guys triggered arguments			1
but what could i do about it ? ' the couple had two sons - @entity100 , now 13 , and seven - year - old @entity101 - yet even being a busy mother - of - four took no toll on @entity11 's looks			1
she reveals : ' when he was 42 i still looked 22			2
people did n't believe i had four children			1
' he hated people asking if he was my dad or brother			0
i could see the way things were going again			0
i would have changed it if i could , only there is no operation to make you look older			0
' after five years together , the couple split up and @entity11 feared she would never find love again			1
@entity11 with her son @entity101 , who is now seven , when he was a baby she says : ' i was only chatted up by young guys			1
at first it was flattering but then it got boring			0
' they want to talk about cars and nightclubs but i needed something more			0
there 's no way i would date someone the same age as my son			0
toyboys do not interest me at all			0
' eventually , aged 42 , @entity11 met a 32 - year - old			1
he was mature enough for her yet , she hoped , young enough not to be concerned over her looks			0
but she soon faced exactly the same problems			0
she said : ' people would stare at us as if we should n’t be together			0
he even got called a dirty old man			0
nobody would believe i was a decade older than him and men would approach me to chat me up when i was with him because they thought he could n't possibly be my partner			1
' it became a nightmare			0
i was even accused of being a gold - digger because it looked like i was with a much older man			1
it was driving us both mad			0
it was like history repeating itself			0
' ' i was even accused of being a gold - digger because it looked like i was with a much older man			1
it was driving us both mad ' earlier this year , after five years together , they split up			0
@entity11 revealed : ' once again i found myself alone			1
i was heartbroken that my life was being so badly affected by the way i looked			0
' she has since struggled to meet any men her own age but has no shortage of offers from men 20 years younger			1
she says ' people think that must be great but i am a grown woman with four sons			0
i do n't want to date a kid			0
i want a real man , but men my age do n't want to date me because it makes them look like perverts			2
i feel caught in a trap and i do n’t know what to do			0
' it 's not just her love life that has suffered because of her youthful appearance			0
@entity11 used to enjoy shopping trips with eldest son @entity74 , but he got fed up of his mum being mistaken for his girlfriend - making it impossible for him to meet anyone either			1
@entity11 says : ' girls just assumed he was taken			1
he found it embarrassing to have to explain to them i was his mother			0
' i could n’t believe that me looking young was stopping both me and my son from meeting anyone			0
' friendships have also been wrecked by jealousy over her looks			0
she says : ' as they started to look older and i just looked younger , my friends saw me as a threat to them			2
' their husbands would tell me how young i looked and it annoyed them so they stopped inviting me out			0
it was n't my fault but what could i do ? ' women my own age think standing next to me makes them look old			0
i can see them looking me up and down - i 've even been called a bitch			2
' so i have to hang around with much younger women			2
they are good fun but deep down we 're not into the same things			0
some are younger than my son but what choice do i have ? ' because of the way i look i do n’t feel i fit in anywhere - with young people , or those my own age			1
i bring out the bitchy side in women so i 'm scared to try to make new friends			0
' @entity11 , who uses just soap and water and @entity232 's face cream , has even started examining her face in the mirror in the hope of finding a wrinkle			1
she admits : ' most women dread them while i am desperate to find just one			0
but my face and body are totally smooth			0
' i ’ve lost count of the times people have asked me if i could bottle my secret and sell it - i 'd be a millionaire if i could			2
