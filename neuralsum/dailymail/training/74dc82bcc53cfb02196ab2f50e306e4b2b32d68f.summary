by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 governor @entity2 has said @entity5 staff involved in an astonishing scam to defraud taxpayers could be guilty of ‘ criminal conduct ’			1
@entity5 was yesterday discovered to have ripped off the @entity9 at the height of the financial crisis by lying about its creditworthiness			1
this allowed the state - backed bank to gain access to tens of billions from a government ‘ lifeline ’ scheme at favourable rates – but left taxpayers out of pocket			1
yesterday – as @entity5 was fined £ 218million and a senior mp said the public did not understand why rogue bankers had not been jailed – details of a letter sent by mr @entity2 to the @entity5 chairman revealed the governor ’s fury			1
he wrote : ‘ such manipulation is highly reprehensible , clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved			1
’ he added that ‘ in view of the seriousness of this matter ’ , the @entity3 will consider pursuing further action against @entity5 and the individuals involved			1
@entity5 also faces a possible investigation by the @entity52			1
@entity5 chairman @entity53 replied : ‘ this was truly shocking conduct , undertaken when the bank was on a lifeline of public support			1
’ last night @entity60 mp @entity59 , who sits on the @entity61 , said : ‘ the public does n’t understand why bankers have not gone to prison			1
ripped off the @entity9 : lloyds was fined £ 218million and a senior mp said the public did not understand why rogue bankers had not been jailed ‘ this is , on the face of it , a deliberate action to defraud the taxpayer by a bank that we bailed out			1
’ his @entity60 colleague @entity75 , chairman of the committee , said : ‘ the banks were manipulating @entity79 [ the inter-bank lending rate ] and the repo rate , in the process deceiving the @entity3 in its operation of a taxpayer - backed support scheme			2
’ he called it ‘ appalling behaviour ’			0
july 27 , 2006 july 28 , 2006 july 19 , 2007 august 17 , 2007 march 31 , 2009 the @entity87 ( @entity88 ) was set up as a lifeboat for @entity91 ’s ailing banks in 2008			0
it allowed banks to swap unwanted , mortgage - backed securities for desirable @entity95 which could be used to swiftly raise cash			0
participating banks were charged a fee by the @entity3			2
this fee was intended to make the overall cost of @entity88 funding comparable with commercial borrowing			0
crucially , the banks were allowed to set their own ‘ repo rate ’ which would determine the level of fees			0
during the period that @entity109 and @entity110 used the @entity88 , they paid £ 1.28billion in fees			0
high street giants @entity111 and @entity112 have already received hefty fines for manipulating @entity79 , which is a key inter-bank lending rate used to set mortgages			0
but @entity5 is the first to be penalised for attempting to fix repo rates to reduce fees for the @entity87			1
@entity5 was the biggest beneficiary from the @entity88 , receiving more than £ 90billion in emergency funds before the scheme was closed in 2012			2
yesterday regulators said that by manipulating the rate , @entity5 also reduced fees paid by other banks , meaning taxpayers were left further out of pocket			2
damning messages published by regulators showed how traders joked about rigging the interest rates			0
one message sent by a trader to his manager on july 19 , 2007 , joked : ‘ every little helps … it ’s like @entity134			0
’ the @entity5 manager replied : ‘ absolutely , every little helps			2
’ reflecting the seriousness of the scam , £ 70million of the £ 105million penalty imposed on @entity5 by the @entity91 ’s @entity140 was for rigging the repo rate			2
the remainder was for manipulating @entity79			0
a further @entity79 - linked fine of £ 113million was imposed by regulators in the @entity145 , bringing @entity5 ’ total fine to £ 218million			2
in total , 22 former and current @entity5 staff were involved in manipulating both rates			1
the bank said all of them have either left , been suspended or will now face disciplinary action			0
@entity5 has also agreed to a demand from mr @entity2 to pay back the £ 7.8million			1
the taxpayer still has a 25 per cent stake in the bank			0
critics have complained that no bankers have been jailed for a string of scandals , although 12 people have been charged by the @entity52 over @entity79 - rigging so far			0
@entity5 ’ bill for mis - selling payment protection insurance is set to hit £ 10billion on thursday , when it is expected to set aside more money to compensate customers .			0

@entity2 says @entity5 staff involved may be guilty of ' criminal conduct '
@entity3 ripped off @entity9 during financial crisis with creditworthiness lies
it gained access to tens of billions from @entity175 at favourable rates
@entity178 says public do **n't** understand why rogue bankers have **n't** been jailed
