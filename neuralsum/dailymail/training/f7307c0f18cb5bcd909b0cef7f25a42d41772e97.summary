by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 05:41 est , 22 november 2012 this is the heart - warming moment a young orangutan called @entity3 bounds joyfully into the @entity5 wild for the first time , his arms waving excitedly above his head			1
even the cameraman struggles to keep up with the thrilled ape as he heads out to explore his new surroundings , to the obvious delight of his carers from the @entity14			1
@entity15 was one of 21 orangutans released into the wild at the @entity18 earlier this month and their reactions - joyful , uncertain , apprehensive - were all caught on camera			1
and he 's off ! the cameraman can barely keep up as a young orangutan called @entity3 bounds off into the @entity5 wild for the first time , running from the cage as soon as it is opened no stopping me now ! @entity15 ca n't contain his excitement as he sprints off to explore his new environment at the @entity18 conservation forest , to the obvious delight of his carers the five mothers and their babies had been looked after at the @entity33 orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centre for several years and many had never experienced the wild			1
they were taken into rehabilitation as young orangutans who , although born wild , found themselves in captivity			1
it can take up to 12 years to prepare them for life in the wild , but pictures like these make all the work worthwhile			2
another one shows @entity49 and her baby @entity50 who , unlike the other orangutans , did n't have to be sedated for the long plane and helicopter journey to the release area			0
instead , the mother picked up her baby and walked calmly into the travel container without any fuss			0
once released , all the orangutans wasted little time in getting to know every tree and branch of their new home - with some even making nests			2
visit the @entity65 's website at @entity66 for more information			0
this is all new to me ! @entity70 takes a good look at his new home before slipping out of the crate			2
he was one of 21 orangutans released into the wild by the @entity76 new home : @entity49 and her baby @entity50 needed no encouragement to jump in the crate to the release area and were the only orangutans who did n't need sedation for the plane and helicopter journey not hanging around : @entity87 and @entity88 get to grips with their new habitat and seem to have wasted no time in finding a branch to swing from not sure about this ! @entity88 looks a bit nervous as he embarks on the move from the @entity33 rescue centre to the conservation forest hold on tight : @entity98 clings on to his mother @entity99 with more than a glint of anxiety in his eyes as they prepare to make their big move into the wild ( left ) , but once there they did n't hesitate in finding a nice tall tree to climb ( right )			1
but while @entity99 is looking for a higher vantage point , little @entity109 just ca n't look down ... they will now be monitored closely for up to a year to make sure they can fend for themselves			0
meanwhile , the @entity114 is just starting its valuable work			0
over the next three years , they have more than 600 orangutans to release from @entity118 in order to meet a government target to return all rehabilitated orangutans to the wild			2
@entity123 , chairman of the @entity124 , said : ' i have a mixed feeling of joy and sadness			0
' i feel sad for us to be separated from the orangutans we have cared for , but i am also excited that 13 orangutans from the 21 to be released have all successfully progressed through our reintroduction programme in @entity33			0
' what a view ! all the orangutans were transported to the conservation forest by helicopter ( left )			0
once there , @entity137 surveys the panorama of the forest canopy but her baby @entity141 only has eyes for the camera in front ( right ) monkeying around : @entity109 climbs on his mother @entity99 's back for a better look around ... but she does n't look too pleased to be carrying the extra weight king of swing : @entity49 and @entity50 take a whistlestop tour between the branches as they get to know their new territory all in a tangle : giant the orangutan seems right at home as she frolics amongst the vines and branches deep in the forest cover a quick peep : deep in the jungle , @entity99 and @entity165 's crate is opened up and they get their first taste of freedom in the wild the big move : @entity173 is wide - eyed in anticipation as he climbs into a crate for the journey into the wild time to go : workers at the rescue centre ensure the sling load around one of the crates is nice and tight as they prepare to transport the 21 orangutans by helicopter on our way : one of the apes is loaded onto the back of a pick - up truck en route to the helipad no fuss : @entity49 came out of her enclosure at the centre without any difficulties not letting go : @entity98 clings to the belly of his mother as they 're carried to transport waiting to take them to the helipad helping hand : @entity49 did n't need any sedation to be lifted into the crates , instead walking calmly there with her baby out of it : @entity141 though needed a little medical help to get through the journey and was sedated before lift - off			1

five mothers and their 16 babies were released into the @entity18 in @entity5
one of them , @entity15 , bounded from his crate with arms waving in wild excitement , to the delight of his carers
