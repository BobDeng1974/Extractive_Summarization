by @entity0 by showing a different side to her character , @entity1 has even become unpopular with her fans fourteen years ago this week , fresh - faced 17 - year - old @entity5 made her @entity7 debut as pretty kennelmaid @entity8			1
since then she 's taken centre stage in some of the show 's most harrowing storylines : who can forget her heartbreaking stillbirth , or when she was widowed after just eight months of marriage ? but for @entity1 things could have turned out very differently			1
years earlier she was turned down for another part - the daughter of @entity19 's girlfriend - when she was 11			2
' @entity20 , the sister of @entity21 , who plays @entity22 , got it because she had ginger hair , ' says @entity1 , 31			1
' i remember crying on the sofa , saying , " what 's wrong with me ? " but now i 'm glad i did n't get it because @entity7 is huge and it could have been a shock to the system at that age			2
' instead , child actor @entity1 - she started drama classes aged six - won roles in @entity35 , heartbeat and doctors , before heading back to @entity38			1
' at 17 , having done other shows , i felt ready for it , ' she says			0
one of @entity1 's disappointed rivals for the role was @entity44 singer @entity43			1
' we 've laughed about it since , ' says @entity1			1
' and @entity43 's done amazingly with @entity44 , so i 'm sure she does n't mind she 's not playing @entity8			1
i definitely would n't want to swap with her - i love my life			0
and anyway , i ca n't sing ! ' @entity1 's enjoyed showing a different side to @entity8 recently - even if it 's got her into trouble with fans			1
this week sees @entity8 's transformation from goody two - shoes to bad - girl complete as her bid to split up her ex @entity56 and @entity57 ends in disaster			1
' for once , i do n't mind people slagging me off , ' she laughs			0
' on @entity61 they all say how much @entity8 's annoying them ! it 's been nice getting a bad reaction			1
' it 's been challenging though , showing another side to her			2
after all the years of hurt it has to explode some time			0
she 's been pretty sane , even with her husband @entity71 being murdered			2
but her boyfriend @entity72 being gay and cheating on her with @entity73 really drove her over the edge			0
thankfully my life 's more settled than @entity8 's			1
' @entity1 describes her outfit a her first @entity78 's appearance as her most embarrassing moment @entity1 lives in @entity80 with hunky @entity83 ice skater @entity81 , 33 - who she partnered on last year 's @entity84 - and her four - year - old daughter @entity85 by her property developer ex-husband @entity86 , who she divorced in 2011			1
@entity1 says , ' i have a really good family behind me			1
mum 's great and picks @entity85 up from school if needed , and @entity86 is just around the corner , so he helps a lot , as does @entity81			2
' @entity1 remains coy about their future plans , and when asked if she fancies getting married again she 'll say only , ' i 'm really happy as i am now			2
' perhaps , given @entity8 's dreadful record with men , @entity1 's right to keep things the way they are			1
cats or dogs ? i love walking my dog , @entity103			0
he 's a @entity104 and is becoming a celebrity because i keep getting photographed with him ! holiday - sun or snow ? the sun , as we do n't get a lot of it in @entity112 ! food - @entity113 or @entity114 ? @entity115			2
i grew up with it because my dad was @entity115			0
@entity118 or @entity120 tv shows ? i 'm working my way through the box set of @entity120 series @entity123 , starring @entity125			0
it 's rude but funny			0
grease or @entity128 ? @entity128			0
me and @entity81 always do ' the lift ' when we 've had a few drinks			0
pop or rock ? pop. i like all sorts - from enya to @entity136			0
my current favourite song is hideaway by @entity138			0
it 's a great summer tune .			0
