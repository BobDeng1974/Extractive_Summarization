tiny quantities of anti-depressants flushed down our sinks and toilets are having a dramatic effect on the behaviour and biology of crustaceans			1
scientists are becoming increasingly aware that common drugs including @entity11 and @entity12 are ending up in our seas and rivers via human waste treatment plants			1
the research found even low concentrations of these drugs are causing the creatures to change colour , grow larger or spawn more regularly			1
researchers claim aquatic wildlife , such as the spot prawn pictured , can be affected by exceedingly small amounts - as little as one nanogramme per litre - of prescription drugs			1
the research found even low concentrations of these drugs can cause creatures to change colour , grow larger or spawn more regularly a range of antidepressants aimed at pets with behavioural problems could become available in the @entity35 later this year			1
prozac - style drugs would help benefit 80 per cent of @entity35 's eight million dogs , according to a recent study			2
the research found that the idiosyncrasies of man ’s best friend , such as chasing their tail relentlessly and barking at the door even if nobody is there , are often born from psychological problems such as anxiety and phobic behaviour			0
and in some cases , a lower concentration affected the creatures more than a higher dose			2
‘ there is a staggering list of prescription drugs passed from humans to wastewater treatment plants and into receiving streams , estuaries , or oceans by direct consumption , metabolism , and excretion , or by toilet flushing of old prescriptions , ’ said dr @entity54 , a marine biologist from the @entity55			2
‘ marine invertebrates , such as amphipod shrimp become more active and increase their speed of movement , while freshwater snails display altered reproduction , and some lose their ability to attach to surfaces			1
‘ some bivalve species , such as zebra mussels , were induced to spawn when exposed to anti-depressants			0
researchers claim a staggering number of prescription drugs , including @entity11 , stock image pictured , are being passed from humans to wastewater treatment plants and into streams , estuaries , or oceans by direct consumption , metabolism , and excretion , or by toilet flushing of old prescriptions some bivalve species , including zebra mussels , pictured left , are induced to spawn when exposed to antidepressants			1
marine invertebrates , such as amphipod shrimp become more active while freshwater snails , pictured right , display altered reproduction and some lose their ability to attach to surfaces dr @entity54 added that just as antidepressants affect hormones such as serotonin in the human brain , many biological functions within invertebrates are similarly under the control of serotonin			1
‘ in many invertebrates , serotonin controls the release of certain pigments , causing the creature to change colour and recent studies have shown that anti-depressants can alter colour changes in cuttlefish			0
the drugs can also affect growth , feeding and metabolism , ’ he said			0
‘ what we now know is they can be affected by exceedingly small amounts , as little as one nanogram per litre - the equivalent of dropping a few grains of the compound into an @entity133 - sized swimming pool			0
just as anti-depressants affect hormones such as serotonin in the human brain , many biological functions within invertebrates are similarly under the control of serotonin			0
for example , in invertebrates such as the cuttlefish , pictured , serotonin controls the release of certain pigments , causing the creature to change colour ‘ although concentrations observed in our rivers and estuaries are very small , it 's worrying that an increasing number of studies have shown that these incredibly small concentrations can dramatically alter the biology of the organisms they come in contact with			2
’ dr @entity54 said the release of human pharmaceuticals into aquatic ecosystems is an environmental problem we should consider seriously			0
‘ a body of evidence is building that suggests anti-depressants at concentrations currently found in surface , waste and groundwater are sufficient to cause a wide variety of effects			2
‘ this is despite the fact that reports indicate these types of drugs take up only 4 per cent of the known pharmaceuticals detected in the environment			0
’ the research is published in the journal @entity179 .			0

a ' staggering ' amount of drugs are being flushed into seas and rivers
these include antidepressants such as @entity11 and @entity12
lower than *expected* concentrations are affecting the behaviour and biological make - up of aquatic creatures
shrimps move *faster* , while snails lose the ability to attach to surfaces
other effects include changing colour , growing larger and spawning more
