@entity170 : 2:07.81min wr : 2:01.84 throughout the competition , the flag - waving home crowd had gone wild when @entity18 's beaming smile was projected on the big screens			1
draped in a @entity180 flag , @entity177 , 28 , of @entity178 , north @entity23 , said she felt lucky to be part of the @entity7			0
' they said there were two billion applications for some of the tickets in the stadium , ' she said			0
the noise , the flags , the excitement - even the sun 's come out			1
' it 's been an amazing day , absolutely amazing			2
' she sent the @entity39 into raptures yesterday with @entity196 of a stellar heptathlon performance – then she got set for gold			2
@entity18 brought a capacity crowd to its feet with a sensational start to the athletics , setting a @entity4 record in the event for the 100 - metre hurdles			1
at one stage she was conducting applause from the track by raising her arms and turning 360 degrees around the vast @entity39 , creating the most electrifying atmosphere it has seen so far			0
go girl ! go @entity215 ! ’ they bellowed , chanting ‘ @entity218 ! ’ until it reached a crescendo			2
but the @entity9 - born champion was rendered ‘ speechless ’ when she saw her 12.54 second record for the 100 - metre hurdles flash up on the scoreboard – a lifetime best , and equal to the gold medal winning time in the women ’s hurdles in @entity225			1
the amazing performance propelled her instantly to the top of the leader board , precisely the kind of start she needed			0
and still the crowd cheered			2
composed : after a shaky start @entity18 celebrates after her second jump in the women 's heptathlon @entity236 long jump event jubilant : @entity18 had been in trouble with a first round jump of 5.95m , significantly down on her rival @entity242 's 6.54m			1
but she managed 6.40m in the second round and 6.48m in the third ‘ show us yer abs ! ’ , a lone voice demanded as she took off her tracksuit for the high jump			1
( the 2012 poster girl has come to be known as the @entity257 pin - up because of her enviable six - pack abdominal muscles and torso , repeatedly grandstanded yesterday to the delight of front - row spectators )			1
sometimes the crowd cranked up the volume so much it drowned out the names of the athletes as they were announced on loudspeakers			2
when they clapped and stamped their feet , it vibrated all through the stands			0
it just blew me away to be honest , ’ @entity18 said afterwards			0
‘ how much they got behind me was amazing			0
you try and prepare yourself but it ’s nothing like you can imagine			0
it was a great start to the day			0
’ will there be joy on @entity14 ? @entity0 raises her arms in celebration after finishing the 200 - metre race in the heptathlon competition yesterday event four : @entity0 claims a personal best in the 200m to put her back in the driving seat for heptathlon gold thumbs up : @entity18 is leading the way in the heptathlon after the first day of action at the @entity39 the athletics were conducted in breaks between a loudspeaker soundtrack that blared out hits from the @entity294 and @entity295 , among others – plus @entity298 ’s @entity297 is shining when it pelted with rain for a few minutes , flooding uncovered areas in the stands and drenching lower - tier spectators in their seats			1
barely a single empty seat could be spotted inside the stadium when @entity18 and her team - mates were in the arena			2
her parents @entity18 and @entity311 were here – waving a @entity313 and cheering their daughter towards victory at every stage			0
‘ this is her dream , ’ they said – then spoke of their hopes that she will achieve her ambition to win gold in front of a home crowd			1
high hopes : @entity0 fell slightly behind in the heptathlon after a disappointing shot put , but is expected to claw back some ground in the 200m jumping for victory : @entity0 during the @entity329 at the @entity39 she has dreamed about this for so long , ’ miss @entity311 said			1
‘ it has been a long wait , and she has worked very hard			2
’ elsewhere , crowds gathered at a giant screen in the @entity334 , the @entity336 equivalent of @entity338 ’s @entity337			0
there was another in @entity9 ’s @entity341 , where she first ran as a 13 - year - old			0
her secondary school hosted a final ‘ good luck ’ celebration , and the city council appeared to have contingency plans to cope with a chaotic homecoming if she returns triumphant			0
on the internet , @entity350 mentions of ‘ @entity18 ’ increased 600-fold around the time she chalked up her first stunning result			0
but it meant @entity18 , who was absent from @entity225 four years ago through injury , is now under intense pressure to come up with a gold			0
uniquely in the public mind , and possibly in her own , winning mere silver would be regarded as failure			0
@entity364 , her coach since childhood , said she was probably the only person in the @entity4 track - and - field team who , if she fails to win gold , it would be viewed as a loss .			1
