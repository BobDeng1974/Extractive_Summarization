@entity0 was also hit with a £ 453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the @entity18			2
the loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time for chancellor @entity33 , six days before the @entity34			2
a return to profit for both @entity0 and state - backed @entity36 would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the @entity42 government in 2008			1
