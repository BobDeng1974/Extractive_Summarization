@entity31 , who runs a construction firm with her family , said : ' we really miss having @entity10 about - she 's a real character and we 'd love to find her and bring her home			1
' we ca n't believe she 's done a real - life @entity44 - but she 's such a character , we knew if any of our chickens was going to go on such an adventure , it would be her			0
' she was named after @entity49 , so it 's quite fitting she 's created her own little mystery for us to solve			0
' she 's a very nosy chicken , and always poking her beak into what 's going on - so we 're not hugely surprised that she got herself into the back of a truck			0
' we thought a fox had got her after she disappeared on saturday - but it suddenly occurred to me that she had been hanging around the delivery van , and i phoned the delivery company to ask if they 'd seen her			0
' i thought they 'd probably laugh at me , but they said they had found a chicken in one of their vehicles			0
' the delivery driver got a huge fright when he opened the doors and she came flying out			0
' he said she 'd run off before he had a chance to realise what was going on			0
' the bird fled 40 miles from home in a delivery van			2
pictured is another chicken from @entity31 's coop @entity31 is now desperately trying to find @entity10 and believes she would n't have got too far from @entity25			1
she added : ' we just hope that she has n't been caught by a fox but she 's a pretty wily bird , so we 're sure she 'll be fine			0
' @entity10 is very friendly , and if you whistle , she 'll come waddling straight over to you			1
' we are doing some building work at our house and @entity10 knows , as soon as the mini-digger comes out , that there 'll be lots of worms so she runs straight over - she 's very ' we 'd love to have her back - and just hope that someone out there has spotted her			1
