@entity0 gave @entity1 and @entity2 their first starts but it was the wise old head of @entity5 who rescued them against @entity8			1
the @entity9 came on in the second half to pull the strings and converted a penalty to make the score 1 - 1			2
@entity5 came extremely close to leaving @entity0 this summer , having been linked with moves to both the @entity15 and @entity16 , but eventually decided to see out the last year of his @entity0 deal - and having that experience around while the squad deals with huge changes could prove vital			2
eye on the ball : @entity22 controls the ball with the outside of his left foot as a @entity8 player tries to tackle him @entity27 : @entity28 holds off @entity29 during @entity0 's second pre-season friendly shouting instructions : @entity32 signals to his players during @entity0 's 1 - 1 friendly draw with @entity8 @entity32 's side had flown to @entity36 on saturday morning after a week 's training at @entity38 , to face opponents who are ready for the new season			1
nice kick off their @entity43 campaign next weekend , but the @entity44 still have three weeks to go before @entity45 begins			0

goal : @entity5 pen 67			0
they were without @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 for this clash , all of whom return to the fold on august 5			0
@entity0 's second pre-season friendly , following their 1 - 0 win over @entity95 , featured a lot more of their stars with the @entity99 players returning to action			1
@entity101 is still absent for family reasons , while star signing @entity103 is suspended			0
instead , it was some of the other summer purchases who got the chance to appear at the @entity109			0
@entity1 had a shaky start to his @entity0 career , with a couple of misplaced passes and then a foul on the edge of his own box			1
the @entity36 has plenty to prove at @entity0 with a â‚¬ 20million fee on his shoulders , a baffling amount for someone about to turn 31			2
there is pressure on @entity2 too , who is expected to be the long - term successor to @entity126			2
he remained calm , palming a low free - kick away and gathering a long shot with ease early on			0
however , there was little he could do about the opening goal , when @entity67 gave away a penalty			0
the defender is coming off the back of a poor season and a worse @entity136 and shoved over @entity59 in the box			2
it was a soft decision to give , but the player picked himself up and rifled it past @entity2			0
the goalkeeper dived low to his right and got a hand to @entity59 's effort but it was not enough			0
cool finish : @entity59 made no mistake with his spot - kick , sweeping a shop past @entity2 applause : nice forward @entity59 is congratulated by his team - mates after putting the @entity36 side in front @entity78 - brother of @entity154 - is also looking to impress this season , but started up front in an unfamiliar false nine role			1
he made way at half - time along with several of his team - mates as a new look side entered the fray			1
sporting director @entity162 hailed @entity1 for his immense pace when he was presented , but the defender was caught out by @entity54 and had to bring the midfielder down on the right			2
however it was also @entity1 who headed the resultant free - kick away - his extra height will be a boost for @entity0 at the back this season			1
@entity0 were sloppy in the first - half , creating little until the minutes before the interval			1
@entity22 hit the bar with a mis - hit cross , while a surging run from highly - rated youngster @entity179 was rudely ended with a trip			0
@entity22 cut the free - kick back to @entity182 , whose low drive was beaten away by @entity46			0
connection : @entity8 goalkeeper @entity47 punches the ball away from @entity0 centre - back @entity68 flawless technique : @entity28 controls the ball brilliantly in front of @entity29 in midfield @entity191 , having taken to the field for the first time in the no 5 shirt he inherited from retired captain @entity195 , made way for @entity5 , @entity73 made his debut , replacing @entity28			1
@entity0 should have been level five minutes after the re-start , when @entity200 pressured @entity8 into an error , but @entity79 fired straight at the goalkeeper when clean through			1
the game began to open up more in the second half , with @entity0 looking a lot more incisive thanks to veteran midfielder @entity5			1
he played three sublime passes shortly after coming on , helping @entity0 look significantly more threatening			0
it was the 34 - year - old who pulled @entity0 level , after @entity79 was taken down in the box by @entity213 and the game 's second penalty was awarded			1
@entity5 sent @entity216 the wrong way from the spot , dispatching it into the left - hand side of the net			0
young guns : @entity74 , left , and @entity78 , right , were both given playing time by @entity0 boss @entity32 they could have added a second a few minutes later , but @entity200 was selfish and ended up being tackled at the end of a fantastic run			1
his decision making was the one aspect of his game which was lacking at @entity229 and he should have squared the ball to @entity79			0
instead @entity231 stole in to sweep the ball away			0
@entity80 had an opportunity late on , curling the ball against the left - hand post in the 82nd minute from close range after @entity238 's sliced shot landed at his feet			0
@entity32 wo n't be too disappointed with the result , with his players still some time away from being fully fit and also without their star names			2
however , he will hope that the injury which forced @entity65 off in the first half is not too serious , and that the side have more fluency on wednesday night			0
next up for @entity0 are @entity249 's @entity248 , who will be a far tougher proposition than @entity8 .			1

veteran midfielder scored late penalty to level the scores in friendly match
@entity8 took the lead from the spot in the first half through @entity59
@entity0 boss @entity32 started new duo @entity1 and @entity2 , while @entity73 , their recent signing from @entity264 , came on at half - time
