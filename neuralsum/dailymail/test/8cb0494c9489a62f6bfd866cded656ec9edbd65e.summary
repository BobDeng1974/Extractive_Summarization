ever since the @entity1 launched in 2009 , @entity0 has followed a new handset one year with a marginally - different 's ' version the year after			1
but rumours suggest it is about to abandon these plans by skipping the launch of a @entity8 this autumn in favour of going straight for the @entity1 7			1
this difference may seem slight , but it suggests the next model of @entity1 could be substantial improvement on @entity1 range , and rumours have hinted towards new features such as @entity15			1
rumours suggest @entity0 is about to abandon the @entity8 later this year in favour of going straight for the @entity1 7			1
this difference may seem slight but it suggests the next model of @entity1 could be substantial improvement on @entity1 range ( pictured ) , and rumours have hinted towards new features the claims were made by @entity20 analyst @entity19 during a note to investors on tuesday , reports @entity23			1
he said the next - generation @entity1 will feature @entity15 , recently added to the @entity25 and new macbook			1
@entity0 describes @entity15 as the ' most significant new sensing capability ' since @entity28			1
it recognises typical scrolling and pinching gestures , but it additionally tracks the pressure of a person 's click and responds accordingly			2
the claims were made by @entity20 analyst @entity19 who said the next - generation @entity1 will feature @entity15 , recently added to the @entity25 and new macbook ( pictured )			1
it recognises typical scrolling and pinching gestures , but additionally tracks the pressure of a click and responds accordingly @entity0 released its @entity40 update yesterday			1
and in addition to 300 new emojis , including the much - anticipated ' racially diverse ' people icons , @entity0 also rolled out @entity44 calling on more networks			1
people on @entity47 in the @entity48 and @entity49 in the @entity50 can now use their iphones to make calls using the web			0
@entity44 calling routes calls through a @entity44 instead of using mobile signal , which can be notoriously temperamental			0
calls made over @entity44 do n't use minutes or data and can be used to make free calls when roaming			0
@entity0 added the option in @entity60 in september , although it was only used by @entity61 at that time			2
@entity49 launched the @entity50 's first @entity63 service earlier this week on the @entity64 and @entity66 's @entity65 and @entity67			0
although services such as @entity69 and @entity71 offer calls over @entity44 , @entity63 does n't require an app and uses the handset 's built - in dialler and contact list			2
this means gestures and tracking feel more intuitive and are more responsive			0
and on the watch this feature is used to access more options in menus , for example			0
if @entity15 is added to the next @entity1 , mr @entity19 said the change will be significant enough to warrant @entity0 adding the 7 moniker to any new handsets			1
this follows recent rumours which suggested a 4 - inch version of the @entity90 is in development to replace the @entity92 with a lower cost and ' female friendly ' design			0
the handset will be launched during 2015 , according to @entity97 rumour site @entity98 , and it would complement the current range of larger 4.7 and 5.5 - inch screen sizes			0
in particular , the @entity98 report called the new design ' female friendly ' , alluding to the fact women typically have smaller hands than men			0
this could be known as the @entity108 , or based on mr @entity19 's predictions , the @entity110			2
the larger handsets were extremely well received and became @entity0 's fastest - selling product to date , selling more than 10 million units within the first three days			2
many doubted how successful a large screen @entity1 would be , claiming it was too big but the recent sales figures show the 6 @entity116 is outselling every other ' phablet ' in the @entity48			0
despite being on the market for just a single month of the three months ending october 2014 , the @entity118 captured 41 per cent of ' phablet ' sales			0

claims were made by @entity139 - based @entity20 analyst @entity19
he said the next - generation @entity1 will feature @entity15
this was added to the watch and @entity144 and tracks click pressures
if true , the change will be significant enough to warrant @entity0 calling its handset @entity1 7 rather than adding a *traditional* 's ' to the @entity1 range
