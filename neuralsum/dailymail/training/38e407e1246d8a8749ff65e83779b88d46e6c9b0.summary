by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:23 est , 23 february 2014 the @entity6 's @entity5 residence is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country , figures reveal today			0
traffic traveling along the @entity12 - known as @entity13 - which runs adjacent to @entity14 , produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide ( @entity17 ) in 2012 , data shows			1
figures from the @entity19 show the average level of the gas - produced mainly from diesel engine traffic fumes - was 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air			1
@entity14 is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country , data shows traffic along @entity13 - which runs adjacent to the @entity14 - produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide ( @entity17 ) in 2012 at 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air the figure is almost four times the @entity34 legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre			1
@entity36 , another road close to the @entity14 , registered as 109 micrograms per cubic metre			1
other highly polluted areas include @entity39 near @entity40 , which registered at 150 micrograms and @entity41 near @entity42 on 138 micrograms			2
the fourth and fifth locations were @entity44 and @entity45 - which measured 135 and 134 micrograms respectively			0
roads near other top @entity5 tourist attractions such as @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 also featured on the list of 50 worst offenders - all of which were in @entity5			0
the road running next to the @entity6 's @entity5 residence was the worst offender on a list of 50 locations provided by @entity19			0
the @entity34 legal limit is 40 micrograms per cubic metre a graphic showing the five locations with the highest levels of @entity17 in the country , all in @entity5 - measured in micrograms per cubic metre of air outside @entity5 , @entity66 scored 68 , @entity67 63 and @entity68 59 micrograms per cubic metre			1
almost 30,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by air pollution			0
nitrogen dioxide in particular has been linked to breathing issues			1
today environmental groups criticised the statistics			0
@entity76 , founder and director of clean air in @entity5 , said : ' these levels of nitrogen dioxide ( @entity17 ) are nothing short of staggering			1
' @entity83 guideline is no human exposure in a single hour over 200 micrograms per cubic metre ( with an annual average guideline of 40 )			1
@entity39 near @entity42 measured 150 micrograms per cubic metre ' the thought that hundreds of thousands or millions of tourists and @entity90 in a year may be exposed to air pollution this high is deeply troubling			1
' in @entity5 , we need the mayor to : ban the oldest cars emitting carcinogenic diesel exhaust as @entity97 did more than four years ago , remove the turning circle requirement that still forces cabbies to choose between two large diesel taxis if they want a new vehicle and reinstate phase 5 of the low emission zone that was a key commitment in the mayor ’s @entity104 until scrapped early last year			0
' he also needs to ensure his ultra-low emission zone for 2020 includes the roads with the highest @entity17 rather than excluding them which will force the most - polluting vehicles to join those avoiding the congestion charging zone and issue smog warnings to save lives , avoid hospitalisations and build public understanding of air pollution			2
@entity41 had the third highest levels of @entity120 at 138 micrograms ' in short , ‘ invisible ’ air pollution is where smoking was 30 years ago in terms of the known health risks and the lack of public awareness			2
people need prince @entity128 to champion action to comply with air pollution laws in @entity5 and elsewhere			0
' the @entity131 faces fines of up to £ 300m from the @entity34 commission after they launched legal action due to a failure to reduce high levels of @entity17 air pollution from traffic			1
the commission said this was despite over a decade of warnings and several extensions and postponements given to the @entity131 government			2
other @entity34 countries have also failed to meet the air quality directive , the commission said			0
a @entity19 spokesman said : ' air quality has improved significantly in recent decades			0
just like for other member @entity148 , meeting the @entity17 limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge			1
' that is why we are investing heavily in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads and we are working with the @entity157 to ensure this happens as soon as possible			0
' @entity44 had 135 micrograms per cubic metre			1
the data follows the news the @entity157 is to take legal action against the @entity131 for its failure to lower levels of the toxic gas @entity45 measured 134 micrograms			1
environmental groups have today slammed the data , saying the findings are ' nothing short of staggering ' the highlighted that the @entity131 meets the @entity171 air quality limit values for all other air pollutants			2
responding to the latest figures , a spokesman for @entity174 said : @entity5 ’s air quality is steadily improving , meeting legal limits for eight out of nine @entity171 regulated pollutants			0
' since the mayor was elected @entity17 emissions have reduced by 20 per cent and the number of people living in areas exceeding @entity17 limits has halved but he fully recognises the need to take further action			2
' this includes the introduction of the world 's first @entity189 in central @entity5 from 2020 , tougher requirements for taxis from 2018 and a £ 20million fund to tackle local problem areas			0
' these most ambitious measures will deliver enormous economic and environmental benefits for central @entity5 and will make this global city an even better place to live , work and visit			0

@entity13 , next to @entity14 , the most polluted road in @entity131
level of toxic nitrogen dioxide gas at 152 micrograms per cubic metre
@entity207 is four times the @entity34 legal limit of 40 micrograms
@entity17 is mainly produced by traffic fumes from diesel engines
comes as the @entity157 launches legal action against @entity131 for failure to lower high levels of @entity17 gas
