' no amount of " securing " can not be undone by readily available tools , bolt croppers and portable disc cutters are both very cheap , ' wrote @entity47			2
' we need police , on patrol at night , and perhaps some streetlights again ? ' @entity52 added : ' the issue is n't that people do n't secure their sheds			0
the issue is we do n't have any police on the beat			2
' @entity59 asked : ' there are no police on the beat , crimes are being committed on a regular basis in the same areas , why on earth do n't the police patrol these areas ? ' and @entity69 said : ' is our police force policing @entity71 or a @entity72 ?

over the course of two days , tuesday , january 28 and wednesday , february 5 , police in @entity12 visited a total of 92 homes to highlight insecurities in people 's homes and vehicles			1
some 40 properties were visited in @entity102 , including the unlocked shed where the fishing equipment was discovered			1

' @entity8 is a crime prevention tool used to raise awareness among residents of how leaving your property insecure can make it all too easy for a thief to enter			1
since the initiative began we have visited over 130 properties and are sure that residents would prefer a police officer enter their home than a burglar			2
' despite our best efforts in the past to highlight the dangers of leaving property insecure it still occurs throughout the county and therefore we have to come up with new ways of raising awareness			0
if the initiative is now gaining media interest we would suggest it is working			0
' officers will always knock on the door of a property first and await a response			0
if there is no response then a uniformed officer will try the door to see if it is insecure			0
if this is the case they will enter , make sure no one is inside of the property before leaving a leaflet to explain that we have been and why			0
' the spokesman added that there were no immediate plans for @entity8 to make a return			2
' i do n't think there are any plans at the moment , we do it if we have a particular spate of burglaries , ' she said .			0
