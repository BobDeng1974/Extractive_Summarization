immigrants are being granted permission to settle in @entity3 despite having ‘ zero income and no employment ’ , a government inspector warned last night			1
the failure to carry out full background checks on the migrants undermines a key @entity10 policy that applicants should be able to support themselves and their families without relying on the @entity13			1
foreign nationals who want to remain in the @entity3 permanently are supposed to undergo strict checks by officials into their financial background			2
as a minimum , they require enough money to pay for housing , plus a disposable income of more than £ 100 a week			2
but the chief inspector of immigration , @entity20 , found potentially tens of thousands were having their applications rubber - stamped without either a face - to - face interview or @entity34 investigation			1
an estimated one million migrants apply for permission to stay in the @entity3 each year			2
but , incredibly , @entity34 is willing to do only 3,000 checks a year for the @entity38 – just 250 every month			2
such checks would establish if a migrant who claimed to be able to support themselves was telling the truth about their income or even having a job			1
as a result of the @entity34 policy , officials are letting migrants stay without having had access to wages slips , p60 forms and other crucial data			2
mr @entity20 , who carried out spot checks on a small sample of cases , said officials had granted permission to settle here despite the applicant having ‘ zero income and no employment ’			1
@entity34 is only willing to do 3,000 checks a year for the @entity38 despite an estimated one million migrants applying for permission to stay in the country each year he said the number of @entity34 checks was ‘ insufficient ’ and must be urgently increased			1
of 49 cases he looked at where migrants were asking to stay on the grounds of marriage , not a single person was interviewed			1
this is despite huge concern over sham marriages			0
in other cases , the application was decided while the husband or wife was still overseas			2
mr @entity20 said in one in every ten of such cases the decision reached by immigration officials was ‘ unreasonable ’ , mainly due to insufficient evidence the migrant could afford to support themselves			1
the inspector raised his concerns in a report which focused on how @entity38 handles cases involving marriage and civil partnerships			1
in it , he also said there are currently more than 16,000 migrants waiting to hear from border officials whether they can stay in @entity3 in yet another ‘ unacceptable ’ @entity38 backlog			1
some 14,000 applicants , growing at a rate of 700 a month , have already been refused the right to stay but are pleading with officials to reconsider			2
an additional 2,100 cases – shipped in a box from a @entity38 office in @entity104 to @entity105 – are still waiting for an initial decision , some dating back a decade			1
mr @entity20 said : ‘ this is completely unacceptable and i expect the @entity38 to deal with both types of case as a matter of urgency			1
@entity20 said immigrants were being granted permission to settle despite having ' zero income and no employment ' ferry passengers caught entering @entity3 with cocaine in their luggage are being let off with just a small fine			1
instead of arresting and prosecuting , border officials are routinely confiscating the drugs , allowing passengers to pay around £ 100 and then letting them carry on their journey			0
@entity20 , chief inspector of @entity125 and @entity126 , said the approach was unlawful and anyone caught with class a drugs should be put before a court			1
his report into border controls found two occasions where a small amount of cocaine was discovered on a passenger or in their luggage coming into @entity138 via @entity139			0
both cases involved less than 1g of the drug			0
under customs laws , passengers caught with small amounts of @entity146 and @entity147 drugs can pay a ‘ compound settlement ’ , have the drugs confiscated and escape prosecution			0
but that law does not extend to class a drugs			0
anyone caught entering with even small amounts of heroin , cocaine or ecstasy must be arrested and can face a lengthy prison sentence			0
the report said : ‘ although the amount was small , we were concerned that in one case investigators advised a compound settlement for the offence , given that this was contrary to @entity168 ’s own guidance			0
‘ @entity168 subsequently informed us that they had revised their guidance to reiterate that class a drugs fall outside the scope of compounding			0
’ ‘ delays also mean enforcement action is likely to be more difficult in the event the case is ultimately refused			0
this is because the individual will have been in the @entity3 for a number of years and may have developed a family or private life			0
’ he also said the percentage of successful appeals in marriage cases was too high , at 53 per cent from april 2011 to february last year			0
mr @entity20 told @entity187 's today programme this morning : ' work is being transferred but missed or lost			1
the organisation should know what its own backlog and workload is , then it can prioritise			1
' i was concerned at the high rate of appeal			0
' he admitted that 13 per cent of cases remained unresolved			0
@entity198 , minister of state for immigration , told the show that the 14,000 outstanding appeals had not been done through the proper channels			2
' we went and just allowed people to say , " can you just go through it again ? " they should have given a clear message			0
' we inherited an agency with a lot of problems			1
' sir @entity211 , of @entity212 , said : ‘ this is yet further evidence of the chaos in the immigration system			0
’ @entity38 said last night : ‘ we are working with @entity34 to increase the number of searches we can do against their systems			0
since this report we have brought in strict new rules on proving income levels to make sure that those bringing in family members are able to support them			0

chief inspector of immigration @entity20 said many had ' zero income '
thousands may have had applications rubber - stamped without full checks
a further 16,000 are still waiting for a decision on whether they can stay
some of the cases date back almost a decade , to 2003
minister for immigration said he inherited an agency with problems
mr @entity20 said the organisation should have known what its backlog was
