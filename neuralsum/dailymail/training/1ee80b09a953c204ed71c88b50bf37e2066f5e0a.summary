a toddler born with a rare condition that made her feet run out at right angles has taken her first steps			1
@entity5 was born with dislocated hips due to a rare condition called @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
this meant she could n’t straighten her legs , stand on her own , or walk			1
the toddler , from @entity12 , @entity13 , had to have both of her legs broken and metal bolts inserted to rebuild her hips			1
@entity5 ( with parents @entity17 and @entity19 ) was born with a rare condition that made her feet turn out at right angles diagnosis : @entity5 was suffering dislocated hips due to a rare condition called @entity8 ( @entity8 ) recovery : @entity5 can now walk properly for the first time thanks to surgery without the surgery , it is likely that @entity5 , now two , would not have been able to walk properly , and she would have had further hip problems in the future			1
her mother @entity19 picked up on her condition when she noticed her feet were sticking outwards			1
mrs @entity5 , 31 , said : ' her feet were pointing at right angles , from the age of just eight weeks old			1
' i was a first time mum and i did n’t know if @entity5 was developing correctly			2
' doctors reassured me there was nothing wrong , but it just did n’t look normal			0
' she said : ' had her condition been picked up earlier , it could have potentially been rectified with a less invasive procedure , involving what is known as a @entity43 where the hips are held in place to encourage them to grow around the socket			0
' we ’re relieved that we pushed to have further scans or we may still not know about @entity5 ’s @entity8 today			1
i think it was a mum ’s instinct			0
' as @entity5 began to crawl , @entity19 and her husband @entity17 noticed @entity5 was dragging her legs along the floor			1
' it looked as if she had wonky hips			0
it was clear that she had a problem with her stability			0
' said mr @entity61 , 36			0
a further scan revealed that @entity5 did n't have fully formed hip joints and both were severely dislocated			1
this meant she could n’t straighten her legs or stand on her own			2
during surgery , both of @entity5 's legs were broken and metal bolts were inserted to rebuild her hips recovering : without the surgery , it is likely that @entity5 , now two , would not have been able to walk properly , and she would have had further hip problems in the future at 14 months old , @entity5 went through the first of two procedures to try and reposition her hips			1
this involved breaking one of her femurs each time and reducing the hip socket around the top of her leg , before bolting them back into the correct position			0
' just hearing what they were going to do to her was terrifying , ' said mrs @entity5			2
' it sounded frightening but we we told by the surgeon that it was the only option			0
' following the surgery , @entity5 had to wear a full body cast , which stretched from her chest to her ankles , to allow her hip sockets to grow back around the bones			1
she was strapped into the cast for 24 - hours a day , to hold her hips in place			2
this meant @entity19 and @entity17 had to re-learn how to change nappies and buy her a range of specialist medical kit , including a customised £ 250 car seat			0
@entity17 , a tv reporter , said : ' it was a bit of a struggle because we could n’t look after her in the ways we were used to			0
' but we just had to do what was necessary			0
if it meant @entity5 would be able to walk properly , it was worth it			1
' just weeks after the second operation , her cast was removed and @entity5 began to try and pull herself up on furniture , and move around the house in her walker			1
she can now walk , but tires easily road to recovery : @entity5 will have more surgery later in the year when she will have the metal pins removed from her hips just weeks after the second operation , her cast was removed and @entity5 began to try and pull herself up on furniture , and move around the house in her walker			1
' she had very little balance and her confidence was badly knocked , so we had to keep encouraging her to keep going , ' mrs @entity5 , a finance assistant said			2
' but she slowly began to get the hang of it			0
she was very scared at first and so were we but we had to do what was best for our little girl			0
' she can now walk , but she gets tired quite quickly and then tries to revert back to crawling			0
she ’s getting there though			0
' the operation took a lot out of her and it ’s amazing that i ’m finally getting my little girl back			0
' @entity5 will have more surgery later in the year when she will have the metal pins removed from her hips			1
had @entity5 's condition been picked up earlier , it could have potentially been rectified with a less invasive procedure , say her parents for the first six weeks , she will have holes in her femurs , leaving her at risk to breaks while she heals			2
her father said : ' a lot of adults would complain if they had to go through this , but she ’s been fantastic throughout all of her treatment			0
we are so proud of her , she ’s a superstar			0
' providing everything stays where it should , there is nothing to say @entity5 wo n’t live a fully mobile life			2
' @entity5 's parents are now battling to raise awareness of the rare condition , which affects one to three per cent of newborns but which often is n’t picked up until later in life			2
@entity5 's parents are now battling to raise awareness of the rare condition , which often is n't picked up until later in life @entity19 has since organised a walk for @entity5 and other children with @entity8 to raise awareness of the condition			1
all of the children who took part in the ‘ little steps ’ event were 2 - 3 year - olds who have had surgery because of @entity8 or are children who wanted to support their friends			1
' we just wanted to make @entity8 a condition that all new parents are aware of , as early diagnosis is key			2
' the walk , which was held yesterday , was for the charity ‘ steps ’ which has helped the family through their tough time			2
steps support families who are affected by lower limb conditions , helping them to make confident and informed decisions about treatment and guide them through what is often a confusing and difficult time .			0
