@entity1 boss @entity0 is confident his title - winning team is better now that it was 12 months ago			1
the defending champions launched their @entity5 campaign with a hard - fought 2 - 0 win at @entity7			1
@entity0 was delighted with a victory which came despite many of his @entity11 stars having gone into the game short of match fitness , but , while he knows there will be stiff competition once again this season , he is certain @entity1 have grown during his time at the club			1
maybe last year a lot of people doubted we could win the title because it was my first season here in the @entity5			1
' today , we have one year more working with the players and i think we have also a strong squad			2
' but always in @entity33 in the @entity5 , you have five or six teams that can win the title , so we need to have the same attitude as we had today , the hunger with which we have started the season , the same humility with which we played today in every game			1
new recruit : right - back @entity51 has signed for @entity1 from @entity53 this summer competition : @entity55 ( right ) will compete with @entity56 ( left ) to be @entity1 's number one keeper big deal : centre - back @entity60 signed from @entity62 this summer for Â£ 32 million ' i am sure this squad can fight , and we will see at the end of the season which titles we will win			1
' @entity1 got their noses in front when @entity71 expertly converted @entity72 's clever 38th - minute back - heeled pass , but they had to wait until stoppage time at the end of the game at @entity77 to wrap up victory			2
@entity79 secured the points with a close - range finish after goalkeeper @entity82 had blocked his initial effort , although only a remarkable block by @entity85 had denied @entity7 a late equaliser minutes earlier			1
up and running : @entity71 scored @entity1 's first league goal of the season against @entity7 three points : @entity79 wrapped up the 2 - 0 victory for @entity1 , scoring in stoppage time scorers : @entity0 will hope to have @entity71 and @entity79 in fine form this season as @entity1 attempt to retain the title @entity0 said : ' i am very happy because i think it 's always important to start the season winning , especially when you have to play away at so difficult a stadium as @entity77 ' - it 's always a difficult stadium for every team that comes here			1
' maybe in the second half we could n't have so much possession of the ball because seven of our 10 [ outfield ] players were not able to play 90 minutes at the same pace			0
' but we were very concentrated , very well organised and we kept a clean sheet , and finally we decided the game with a second goal			0
' opposite number @entity115 was able to take positives from defeat in a game which saw him hand competitive debuts to @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , with @entity126 and @entity127 getting a first taste from the bench			0
@entity115 said : ' i honestly feel we have come up against individuals today who we are not going to see every week			0
' some of their play is outstanding and you have only got to see it close up to know the quality of [ @entity139 ] @entity138 and @entity71 , the power of @entity141 , and @entity72 up front is a real handful , and i thought we coped with it as well as we could			0
' when you play the top teams , you need a break - there 's no doubt about that			2
quality : @entity7 boss @entity115 accepts the world class players of @entity1 were too good ' whenever i have won against the tops sides , you get a break in the game and it did n't happen for us today			1
we did n't get a ricochet or something that fell our way			0
' but i am as pleased as i can be with a 2 - 0 defeat			1
' @entity115 was less than polite to his opposite number when the sides met on @entity162 last season , but there was no repeat this time around			2
@entity0 said : ' i do n't have any problems with @entity115			2
it was a mistake that he made the other season , but he apologised in the moment , and i told him in the same moment , " do n't you worry about that , it 's finished and all forgiven			0
" ' there was no problem			0
he had a lot of problems last year - not only with me			0
it 's a new season and everyone learns from things			0
