astronomers have discovered stars forming in a remote region of the @entity3 not thought possible before			1
the stars were seen in a cloud of molecular gas 16,000 light - years below the flattened disc of our galaxy - further than any others ever seen			1
and if any planets were to form around these stars , inhabitants would see the entire glory of the spiral galaxy above them in their night sky			1
@entity18 scientists have discovered remote stars forming in the @entity3			1
they are the most distant stars ever to be seen forming in the galaxy			1
shown is an image from @entity25 ’s @entity24 telescope of dust emissions , centred on the star cluster called @entity28			0
some of the stars may be hidden by dust the amazing discovery - led by dr @entity32 of the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity18 - marks the first time that star - forming clusters that are part of the @entity3 have been found this far from our galaxy			1
‘ this is the first time astronomers have found stars being born in such a remote location , ’ said dr @entity32			2
‘ our work shows that the space around the galaxy is a lot less empty than we thought			0
’ previously , it was only thought possible for stars to form inside giant molecular clouds ( @entity54 ) located in the inner part of the galactic disc			0
the @entity3 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars			1
this makes it a ‘ middleweight ’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known , @entity62 , containing more than 100 trillion stars			0
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky , the most you can see from any one point on the @entity68 is about 2,500 stars			1
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the @entity3 has a spiral shape			1
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created			0
and also at the centre is a supermassive black hole , known as @entity80			0
astronomers believe the @entity3 was n’t always a stunning barred spiral , though			2
it may have formed into its current size by ‘ eating ’ other galaxies			0
within these clumps , many stars are born together in clusters			0
using @entity25 ’s orbiting @entity24 ( @entity24 ) telescope , dr @entity32 and his team discovered several @entity92 above and below the disc of our @entity3			2
but they were shocked to find that one @entity54 16,000 light - years from the galactic centre contained two clusters of stars forming			1
their location is towards the outer limits of our galaxy - far enough that they would see the entire splendour of its spiral above them , but not so far that they are not classified as being in the @entity3			1
from the position of @entity68 in the @entity3 , the galaxy appears flat , with most of its material surrounding the supermassive black hole at its centre			2
the new clusters are named @entity28 and 439 , reported the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , and are located within the molecular cluster known as hrk 81.4 - 77.8			0
the cloud is thought to be about two million years old , and is located towards the constellation of @entity121			0
the discovery was made using @entity25 ’s orbiting @entity24 ( @entity24 ) telescope ( artist 's illustration shown )			0
dr @entity32 and his team discovered several @entity127 above and below the disc of our @entity3 - but they were shocked to find that one @entity54 contained two clusters of stars forming the new clusters are named @entity28 ( left ) and 439 ( right ) , reported the @entity116 , and are located within the molecular cluster known as hrk 81.4 - 77.8			1
both of these images are 24 light - years across , and the black dots in the image are individual stars if any planets are in orbit of the stars , this illustration is the view they would see of the @entity3			1
the location of the clusters is towards the outer limits of our galaxy - far enough that they would see the entire splendour of its spiral above them , but not so far that they are not classified as being in the @entity3 there are currently two theories explaining how stars came to be forming in this region so far from the @entity3 , where dust and gas is thought to be much less abundant			1
one theory is known as the @entity161 , which suggests that supernovae and other violent explosions ejected dust and gas out of the galactic disc , merging to form these @entity92			2
this would have required several hundred massive stars to explode over several generations , creating a ‘ superwind ’ that moved hrk 81.4 - 77.8 to its present location			2
bubbles from these explosions would then lead to the creation of new stars within the cloud			0
the other theory suggests that the interaction between the @entity3 and its satellite , known as the @entity179 , may have disturbed gas falling into the galaxy , giving rise to these distant clouds			1
‘ the new clusters of stars are truly exotic , ’ said dr @entity32 , according to the @entity117			0
‘ in a few million years , any inhabitants of planets around the stars will have a grand view of the outside of the @entity3 , something no human being will probably ever experience			2
‘ now we want to understand how the ingredients for making stars made it to such a distant spot			0
‘ we need more data and some serious work on computer models to try to answer this question			0
’ one theory to how the stars came to be is known as the @entity161 , which suggests that supernovae ( illustration shown ) and other violent explosions ejected dust and gas out of the galactic disc , merging to form these @entity92			2
bubbles from these explosions would then lead to the creation of new stars the discovery is the most distant example of star formation taking place in our galaxy			0
many other closer such regions have been discovered before , such as the @entity221 cluster , seen here , which is located about 500 light - years away			1
young stars are seen forming in this infrared image taken by @entity25 ’s @entity225 telescope			0

@entity18 scientists have discovered remote stars forming in the @entity3
they are the most distant stars ever to be seen forming in the galaxy
the stars were spotted in a cloud of dust and gas 16,000 light - years below
from a planet around one of the stars , the entire spiral *structure* of the @entity3 would be seen in the night sky
' @entity244 ' from supernovae could have moved the cloud to its location
