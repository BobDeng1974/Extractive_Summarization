by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 19 august 2013 she 's famous for her fresh - faced looks and appears far younger than her 38 years but according to how not to get old presenter @entity3 , youth does n't always equal beauty			1
' i think the important thing is looking good for your age and not necessarily trying to look younger , ' she revealed in an exclusive interview with @entity11			2
' i think the women who look the best are those who look their age , but have looked after themselves and look good for it , rather than those who are trying to look 20 years younger			2
bare - faced beauty : @entity3 appeared sans make - up in a fund - raising campaign for @entity18 ' as you see wrinkles appearing it can be quite aggravating and of course there are things you can do about them but personally i think it is best to accept what 's happening and make the best of it			1
' @entity3 , who along with her presenting work has co-founded cosmetics company , @entity30 about @entity31 , added : ' my tips would be to look after your skin : although my skincare routine is simple , i believe it can still be really effective			1
' people do n't need to spend hundreds of pounds on products and spend hours on a routine - sometimes all you need is a good moisturiser			2
' also keep your make - up simple			2
the older we get , less is definitely [ becomes ] more			0
' @entity3 certainly knows about paring down her make - up bag			1
last year , she appeared bare - faced alongside @entity42 and @entity43 to help raise money for @entity18			0
despite the lack of make - up , her fresh - faced , glowing complexion appeared enviably youthful and wrinkle - free , although @entity3 complains that she 's had to deal with pigmentation problems and patchy skin since becoming a mother in 2004			1
unable to find products to sort out her skin , she turned instead to make - up artist @entity53 for help			2
the result was paraben - free make - up line , @entity30 , and @entity3 is justifiably optimistic about its future			1
fresh - faced : @entity3 ( pictured with husband @entity58 ) still looks enviably young at 38 business : @entity3 set up @entity60 with the help of make - up artist , @entity53 favourite : @entity3 's hero product is @entity30 about @entity63 20 , Â£ 19.00 ' i am very proud to have the business , ' she revealed			1
' we are still on a journey and have a long way to go			0
' starting up a company , especially in today 's world is tough - it 's dog - eat - dog out there			2
not many businesses even make it into their first year of trading so i feel very proud that we have been able to get it off of the ground and into the make - up bags of so many women everywhere			0
' my aspiration is that the company will grow and one day every woman will be using at least one wild about beauty product in their make - up routine			1
' her own favourite product is the @entity87 , which along with @entity88 , deals instantly with patchy skin			0
' it is the one product that really evens my skin out and i can see a difference instantly - i do n't leave the house without it , ' she enthuses			0
she also makes a point of being careful about looking after her complexion , although admits that she , like many other working mothers , does n't have time for a complex routine			0
' i do n't spend a massive amount of time on my skincare or make - up routine - i get things done really quickly , ' says @entity3			1
' i choose products that are quick and easy to use so that i do n't have to waste too much time on it all			0
' who has the time to spend hours on a beauty routine when you have young children to run after ? ' so does she have any advice for other mothers on the run ? ' i think a really good skin prep followed by a tinted moisturiser is very important , ' she says , seriously			1
' this takes the effort out of getting really nice , even skin and gives a more natural look than piling on layers of foundation			0
' it can also save you a lot of time and avoid that horrible dreaded patchiness that you only notice when you 've run out of the door and got in the car ! ' wild about @entity31 is available on @entity132			0
@entity3 will appear on the channel on 13th september .			0
