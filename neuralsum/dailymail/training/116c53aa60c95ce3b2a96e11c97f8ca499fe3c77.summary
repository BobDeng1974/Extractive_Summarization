@entity7 appeared on this morning where she said the @entity10 tragedy may have been a result of the family being targeted as a result of resentment from other people			1
she said : ' this was an accident waiting to happen			0
there 's a lot of resentment out there for families exactly like this , especially now , especially with the country in the state that it 's in , there 's not much money and people have seen families maybe like this one taking advantage			1
' @entity7 said on this morning that there was a lot of resentment for the @entity33 family grief - stricken : @entity38 and @entity33 , the parents of six children that died following a fire at their home in @entity10 last week , appeared at a news conference yesterday @entity38 and @entity33 were inconsolable yesterday during a press conference about the house fire her comments were met with anger on @entity44 with one user known only as @entity46 saying : ' @entity7 fails at empathy , sensitivity , decency and humanity			1
6 children burned to death			0
stem your hatred for a few minutes			0
' ms @entity7 added : ' this family became a target a couple of years ago and i suspect they have many enemies out there because they were seen to be on benefits , they were seen to be asking for a bigger council house and i think they upset a lot of people at the time			1
' she was speaking the morning after the fire claimed its sixth victim , 13 - year - old @entity69 , who succumbed to his injuries over the weekend			1
his parents , @entity38 and @entity33 , broke down in tears yesterday as police confirmed that an arsonist had started the blaze and petrol had been poured through the family 's letterbox			1
@entity79 , ten , and brothers @entity80 , nine , @entity82 , seven , @entity83 , six , and @entity84 , five , all perished as flames and smoke engulfed their council house in @entity10			1

victims : @entity69 , 13 , ( top left ) next to his brother @entity80 , 9 , ( top right )			1
bottom row ( left to right ) are : @entity82 , 7 , @entity83 , 6 , their sister @entity79 , 10 , and @entity84 , 5 , the family in 2007 , including five of the six children who died			2
back row from left , @entity106 and @entity107 in @entity109 's arms , @entity110 and @entity84 in the arms of mr @entity69 , @entity79 , @entity82 and @entity112			1
front row , from left , @entity115 and @entity116 with mrs @entity33 , @entity69 and @entity80 when @entity90 pointed out that accelerants had been used so it did n't appear to have been an accident , @entity7 responded by suggesting the family had brought it on themselves			1
she said : ' i mean the culture of the family and the fact that they consistently did interviews about their situation			2
they did bring attention to themselves			0
the tragedy ; this is what 's happened			2
six innocent children have died as a result			0
' sixth victim : @entity69 , 13 , died in hospital after his parents made the difficult decision to turn his life support machine off on @entity145 , user @entity143 wrote : ' this is despicable ! no one , @entity146 rich or poor , employed or unemployed deserves to lose a child , let alone 6 ! this " person " , i use the term loosely as any normal thinking person would think " is this comment going to hurt people that are grieving ? " , is abhorrent			1
' there were people who agreed with @entity7 , however , with @entity158 from @entity159 saying : ' i ca n't help but think that @entity7 might be right about the comments she made on @ itvthismorning ' distancing themselves from @entity7 's comments , a spokesman for this morning said : ' the views expressed in the @entity162 newspaper review on monday were those of @entity168 and not shared by @entity169 or this morning			1
' our thoughts are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy at this difficult time			2
' today it emerged hundreds of people are to join hands in a mile - long human chain to help pay for the children 's funerals			1
the fund - raiser will see 1,600 people each pay £ 1 for the funerals , which are due to take place at @entity186 on a date yet to be fixed			1
the funerals were originally due to be held at a local @entity189 , but have been moved to the cathedral because of the large number of people who want to pay their respects the @entity194 want each coffin to arrive at the cathedral in a horse - drawn hearse			1
a series of events have been organised by the local community in support of the family			1
@entity204 , who is co-ordinating the events , said : ' the response from the community has been nothing short of overwhelming			0
' quite often people keep themselves to themselves but this tragic event has helped unite them in their grief and support for @entity38 and @entity33			2
' everyone in the area knows @entity38 , @entity33 and the children and everyone knows how much he loved not just his own children but other people ’s children too			0
' mr @entity204 said hundreds of people from across the world had offered to help raise money for the funerals and surviving family members			1
the human chain event will take place on tuesday , june 5 ; starting at the @entity227 home where the blaze took place and finishing at a local park			0
other fund - raising events include a 16 - mile walk ending in @entity10 city centre			0
local schools are allowing children to come to school without wearing their uniforms tomorrow to raise money for a trust set up to help the @entity240			0
police are yet to establish who started the fire that killed the six children or what their motive was but said yesterday they were ruling no one out			1
one line of inquiry is that the family was targeted because of its ‘ celebrity status ’			0
mr @entity69 , a father of 17 children by five women , became known as ‘ @entity38 ’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house to share with his wife , his girlfriend @entity109 , and eight of his offspring			1
when asked if @entity69 and mrs @entity33 would be quizzed as suspects , officers refused to comment			2
appearing at a press conference yesterday , mr @entity69 , 54 , repeatedly broke down in tears while describing the events of last thursday night and thanking the authorities for their efforts in trying to save his children			2
mr and mrs @entity33 are believed to have been sleeping downstairs when petrol was poured through the letterbox of their three - bedroom council house and ignited with a match or a cigarette lighter			1
the fire then funnelled upstairs , with smoke filling the rooms where the children were sleeping			0
respect : well - wishers have left hundreds of cards , flowers , teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil mr and mrs @entity33 were woken by a smoke alarm but ‘ valiant ’ attempts to save the children were unsuccessful			0
mr @entity69 said : ‘ i want to thank my three eldest children because they have helped us cope			2
and then there ’s a young lad who tried to get in the house the same as myself			0
‘ then of course there is the four firemen , the police , the ambulances , the doctors and nurses – everybody who tried to help save our children			0
‘ we ca n’t express our gratitude enough			0
it ’s not just us that have suffered , it ’s them as well – it ’s everybody			0
’ mr @entity69 said that his son @entity69 ’s organs had been donated to save the life of another child			2
‘ that makes us happy and it takes a bit of the pain away , ’ he added			0
‘ we grew up in a community that ’s been through a lot of problems with violence and to see this community come together like it has , it ’s too overwhelming			0
' those poor gentlemen from the fire brigade , who saw what we saw – my heart goes out to them			0
’ @entity329 , assistant chief constable at @entity330 , said : ‘ the seat of the fire was inside the front door below the letterbox and there are clear indications petrol was used as an accelerant to light the fire			1
‘ the consequence was the fire took hold and smoke went upstairs to where the children were sleeping			0
tragically , those children died of smoke inhalation			0
’ mr @entity329 added that authorities were ‘ not ruling anybody out ’ as suspects			0
mr and mrs @entity33 are yet to be questioned fully because it would have been ‘ utterly inappropriate ’ so soon after the tragedy , he said			0
mr @entity69 ’s former mistress , @entity109 , 28 , and her brother - in - law @entity353 , 38 , had been arrested on suspicion of murder before being released without charge			2
miss @entity109 shared the home in @entity357 with @entity69 and mrs @entity33 until they fell out two months ago			2
she is in a custody battle with mr @entity69 over their five children .			2
