by @entity0 at the age of 28 , with a wealth of @entity4 and international experience under his belt , @entity1 has long since moved beyond the point in his life where he might become star struck at anyone walking through the doors at @entity12			1
nonetheless , @entity14 ’s mr @entity13 admits the appointment of @entity16 as @entity18 ’s @entity17 last week momentarily transported him back to a time he was just another kid with a ball at his feet and a head full of dreams			1
for any @entity14 fan of @entity1 ’s age , those formative years following the club were testing times			1
the early to mid- 1990s were a barren period in the club ’s history			2
despite — to put it kindly — the mediocrity that surrounded the pair in that era , their talents still shone like beacons in the dark			2
some 18 years may have elapsed between @entity16 ’ departure as a player and his return as assistant manager but , to those old enough to remember , those flashes of brilliance are still inspirational			1
‘ when i was growing up , @entity0 was the player i looked up to , ’ @entity1 recalled			1
‘ he wore no 11 for @entity14 and he was one of my heroes			1
i remember him scoring a free - kick at @entity56			0
he was a great player and servant for @entity14			1
i ’m sure everyone is delighted to have him back			0
’ new challenge : @entity1 admits he knew little about new manager @entity60 before his arrival in @entity62 @entity16 , who plied his trade at @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 after leaving @entity14 in 1996 , would have required no introductions to the vast majority of the players who gathered for pre-season training on tuesday			1
@entity18 , by contrast , was a low - profile choice			0
but if the name of the man who took unfashionable @entity77 to the @entity79 title prompted some frenzied internet research when he was first linked with @entity14 , the impression he has made with the squad since they reconvened has been overwhelmingly positive			1
‘ i did n’t know much about @entity18 before he got the job , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ i thought he came across really well and it has been the same meeting him			0
‘ we had a couple of meetings to get to know him and to get an idea of the way he wants to play			0
they were positive and everyone responded well			0
there are differences ( from the last regime ) but he is trying to get his ideas across			0
prepared : @entity1 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 pose together ‘ i ’m sure he has looked at some games and seen things we did well , but there will be things he will think we can improve upon			1
hopefully , we can do well for him			0
’ it would be foolish to rush to judgment on the new regime			0
but there is no escaping how defining the forthcoming three @entity4 qualifiers are			1
hurdle the three trip wires and the wind is in @entity18 ’s sails			2
come a cropper and there is no disguising the deflation			0
@entity118 present a testing but hardly ominous opening assignment in @entity121 on july 15			1
yet these are not unfamiliar tests for this crop of @entity14 players			2
twice in succession now they have faced up to potentially treacherous ties in the middle of summer and have lived to tell the tale			0
familiarity , @entity1 hopes , will breed contentment			2
‘ it gives you experience and you know what you ’re up against , ’ he explained			0
‘ last year , against @entity140 , they were into their season and you could see playing the game how much they wanted to be in the @entity4			2
‘ @entity146 away was difficult , a hostile atmosphere			0
every team is scrapping to get there			0
it does n’t matter about ability when a club wants it and the prize at the end is so big			2
’ new man : @entity16 has put any old disagreements behind him as he prepares to get started at @entity14			1

@entity14 's mr @entity13 looked up to @entity16 as a kid
@entity159 was an *unknown* to @entity1 when he arrived at the club
@entity14 face a testing trip to @entity118 in the @entity4
