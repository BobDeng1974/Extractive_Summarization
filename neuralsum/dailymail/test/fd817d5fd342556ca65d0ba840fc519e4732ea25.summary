@entity0 hailed ultimate impact sub @entity1 for his hat - trick performance in @entity7 ’s comeback @entity5 win over @entity8			1
and then @entity10 manager said the striker ’s desire to prove him wrong should serve as an example to any player left out of his starting @entity15 @entity16 took just 19 minutes to score a treble that takes @entity7 ever closer to a clean sweep of domestic honours , staking an obvious claim to start in sunday ’s @entity21 semi-final against @entity23 at @entity24			1
@entity0 , asked if he thought the forward was trying to prove a point , said : ‘ it looks like that - and that ’s how you ’re going to do it			1
that ’s what i expect from the other subs as well			0
you can be angry but the way to get back into the team is to prove you deserve to play - like @entity1 did today			1
@entity0 celebrates after @entity7 came from behind to beat @entity8 at @entity10 on wednesday ‘ he was fabulous			1
you ca n’t do any better than three goals			0
and his left foot ? he could be a kicker in @entity42 – he ’d be very good , i think			0
‘ he ’s improved a lot in my time here			0
he ’s training well and as a 24 - hour athlete he ’s been getting better and better , even though he eats cakes on the bench sometimes			2
but it ’s just a start – he needs to keep working on small things and he ’ll get even more goals			0
‘ he and @entity51 played well together today and that ’s something to think about when we play with two strikers			0
’ asked if @entity1 is now a certain starter for sunday , @entity0 said : ‘ he played very well today so we ’ll see			1
’ @entity0 shakes hands with @entity1 , who collects the match ball after his hat - trick @entity7 came back from the loss of a goal early in the second half to crush @entity8 , @entity0 saying : ‘ defensively we were very good for the first 60 minutes , we had the ball all the time and they did n’t have a shot on target			1
‘ our attacking play was too slow , too many square passes and we did n’t create anything			0
we said at the break we needed to take more risk and get behind them			0
with @entity1 coming on we had a lot more movement and we opened them up and got our goals			2
’ @entity7 could now win the title against closest rivals @entity78 on may 10 – if both teams win all their games beforehand			1
but @entity0 hopes his team wo n’t even need to beat the @entity78 in their own back yard to be crowned champions			1
@entity1 completes his hat - trick against @entity8 on wednesday at @entity10 to move eight points clear wednesday ’s win took @entity7 eight points clear with six games remaining			1
should both teams win their remaining league games , an away win at @entity91 would finish the race			0
yet @entity0 said : ‘ we could win it before @entity91			2
it ’s possible – if they lose a game and we win we can do that			0
‘ we want to win the title as early as possible and today was a very important win and we ’re in to a very important week			0
if you can get into the last five games eight points ahead we have a very good chance			2
‘ the @entity10 side have two friday night fixtures against @entity105 and @entity106 – and wo n’t play another game on saturday at 3pm this season			2
substitute @entity1 came off the bench to spark @entity7 into life after lacklustre first - half if @entity7 wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against @entity23 on may 24 , the final day of the season			1
@entity78 will play @entity106 in their final game , with the top six completed by a @entity105 derby			1
the final round of bottom six ties could be held on the night of friday , may 22			0
the team which finishes 11th will be consigned to a two - leg play - off against the winners of the @entity124 play - off			2
with @entity127 10 points adrift at the foot of the table with just 15 points left to play for , @entity125 will begin their quest to leapfrog @entity132 out of the play - off spot with a local friday night derby against @entity135			2
