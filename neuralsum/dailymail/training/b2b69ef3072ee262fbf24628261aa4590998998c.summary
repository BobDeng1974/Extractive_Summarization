@entity0 are refusing to rule @entity1 out of next month 's autumn internationals despite @entity3 insisting his groin injury will prevent him playing any role			1
@entity3 director of rugby , @entity6 , is adamant @entity1 will not be involved in any of the @entity7 against @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 after limping off against @entity12 on saturday			1
the 23 - year - old centre was omitted from the 33 - man squad for the @entity15 picked by head coach @entity16 , but tellingly his name was also missing from the list of injured players not considered for selection			1
@entity0 centre @entity1 could be fit for the last couple of @entity7 , insists coach @entity16 @entity1 limped off after 15 minutes of saturday 's 25 - 18 @entity24 victory over @entity12 with a groin injury @entity1 was outstanding against the @entity8 during @entity0 's three - test tour in @entity8 last summer while the opener against @entity8 on november 8 and the clash with @entity9 seven days later are clearly beyond @entity29 , @entity16 has raised hopes that he may be involved beyond that			1
' the reason we brought @entity34 into the camp is that @entity1 wo n't be fit for the start of the series , but we have not shut the door , ' said @entity16 , who retains @entity39 as captain for the autumn			1
' it could take six weeks but we 'll never say never			0
it 's a joint management programme between us and @entity3 and between us we have to get it right			2
' the most important person in all of this is @entity1 and we have to make sure we get his rehabilitation right and get him some game time			2
' there 's no definitive timeline			0
it 's not that sort of injury			0
' head coach ( centre ) named his 33 - man @entity55 on wednesday bath wing @entity57 is one of three uncapped players included in the 33 , with @entity16 revealing his promotion at the expense of @entity62 offers @entity0 similar game - breaking ability to @entity1			1
@entity65 - born @entity57 , a lance - corporal in the @entity66 , has been devastating at the @entity67 this season and @entity16 views him as a contender to start against the @entity8			1
' we 're keen to get working with him because he 's been outstanding for @entity71 , ' @entity16 said			2
' when you lose someone like @entity1 , @entity72 comes into the equation because of his impact in collisions , his ability to beat defenders and carry the ball over the gainline			2
he 's a finisher as well			0
' even allowing for the raw promise offered by @entity57 , @entity1 's power will be missed next month and his absence leaves a gaping hole in @entity0 's backline			1
@entity71 wing @entity57 has earned an @entity0 call - up after scoring six tries in seven matches inside centre in particular and the midfield combination in general have long been the source of headaches for @entity0 , although @entity16 hints that @entity97 and @entity98 will be paired against @entity8			1
' i would n't say the centres are an area of concern , ' @entity16 said			0
' @entity98 and @entity97 have both been outstanding and you have @entity104 and @entity105 there as well			0
there 's plenty of competition			0
' then there is @entity34 who is perhaps the form centre of all of them			0
' it 's about balance - you want a balance of pace , power and footballing ability			0
' we will see them head to head ( in training ) and we will make our decisions on the combinations			0
' @entity0 will be aiming to win the @entity126 ( left ) and the @entity127 vs @entity8 and @entity11 high - profile omissions from the 33 are @entity129 and @entity130 with @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 chosen as the squad 's three fly - halves			1
' i would n't say @entity129 's gone backwards , ' @entity16 said			0
' @entity133 was very unlucky not to start the first test against @entity8 in june - he would have done had he not played in the @entity139 final			1
' @entity133 has the best skills execution , has played in big games and deserves his chance			0
' @entity130 and @entity129 have done well in games this season , but we 've gone for the consistency that @entity133 has shown and the attacking prowess of @entity132 , while @entity131 's inclusion is merited on what he 's done in the past			0
' centre @entity105 and wing @entity151 are present despite enduring mixed tours to @entity8 in the summer			2
@entity155 flanker @entity154 features among the six back rows , while @entity157 is included in a senior @entity0 squad for the first time			2
@entity16 ( left ) will bring seven more players into his squad on sunday ahead of their @entity15 autumn series			1

@entity3 centre @entity1 injured his groin against @entity12 on saturday
@entity0 coach @entity16 is hopeful he can be fit next month
@entity1 will definitely miss matches against @entity8 and @entity9
but @entity16 believes he has a chance of playing in the other matches
@entity1 has not been named in 33 - man squad or on list of injured players
