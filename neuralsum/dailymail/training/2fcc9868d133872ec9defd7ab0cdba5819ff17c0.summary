@entity0 , 85 , is expected to have a send off to remember tomorrow after a social media appeal for mourners to attend his funeral went viral a @entity5 appeal for mourners to attend the funeral of an ex @entity7 has been so successful there are concerns the venue will prove too small			1
@entity0 , 85 , will be remembered at a service in @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , tomorrow			1
the church had feared they would struggle to fill a single row of pews at mr @entity0 's funeral			1
@entity19 - born mr @entity0 , had lived in a care home in @entity21 for the past 14 years			1
the former railwayman died with little known about his family after he spent his final 14 years in a care home in nearby @entity21			0
officials said it would be ' horrible ' if no - one attended his send - off , so the reverend @entity29 , the curate who will lead the service , posted a message on the church 's @entity5 page on monday			1
it said : ' on thursday november 13 , we have the funeral for the @entity39 at 12 noon			2
' he lived in @entity41 before moving to a care home in @entity21 approximately 14 years ago and requested that his funeral be at our church			0
' unfortunately there 's been some difficulty tracing next of kin or knowing who his friends were , or if they 're still in @entity13			0
' if you did know @entity0 or have any more information , please get in touch or come along to his funeral on thursday			2
' twenty four hours after @entity55 posted her plea on the social media site the appeal went viral			2
up to 200 people are now predicted to attend mr @entity0 's funeral - and the only worry now is where to put them all			1
the service will have a battalion bugler play the @entity64 , while two standard bearers will display regimental flags and around 20 veteran and serving @entity68 will turn out in full uniform to pay their respects			1
@entity72 enthusiasts , of which mr @entity0 was a founding member , are also planning to attend the farewell service			1
@entity75 , director of the @entity77 , said : ' nobody wanted to see an empty church for the service of a man who had done a lot in his life			0
' there was a worry that there would be row after row of empty pews with not enough people even to fill the first line			0
@entity0 , 85 , will be remembered at a service in @entity12 in @entity13 ( pictured ) tomorrow ' but once the appeal appeared on @entity5 all that changed			1
i know there 's a bus load of @entity68 coming for the service and many people have been in touch			2
' the phone has been red hot and from what i understand there could be around 200 people attending tomorrow			1
' it could well be there will be more outside the church than in it			0
' colonel @entity107 , @entity108 for 1st @entity109 , said : ' there will be 10 to 15 people from the @entity112 attending the service and up to seven from the battalion			1
' this has only cropped up in the last 24 hours so we 've not been able to trace his service record yet			0
' i understand mr @entity0 did his national service with the @entity109 in the 1940s in @entity120			1
' he added : ' we pride ourselves on being a family regiment			0
we also have a very strong association			0
once you don the uniform you become part of that family			0
' others will be attending the service out of a sense of duty towards a former soldier			0
similar social media campaigns to find mourners for forces veterans have also produced results in recent months			0
in april , @entity136 , believed to have won the @entity137 for his bravery during the @entity140 's campaign in @entity141 , died in a care home at the age of 92 with no known friends or family			0
however a big crowd turned up for his funeral in @entity148 following an online appeal			2
and last month , hundreds of total strangers turned up in @entity151 to pay their last respects to d - day @entity154 veteran @entity153 , who died with no surviving family .			2

@entity158 was worried no one would attend funeral of @entity0 , 85
mr @entity0 did national service with the @entity109 in 1940s @entity120
@entity164 posted a message on @entity5 asking if anyone could go along
appeal went viral and around 200 people are expected to pay their respects
at least 20 veterans and serving @entity7 will turn out in uniform
