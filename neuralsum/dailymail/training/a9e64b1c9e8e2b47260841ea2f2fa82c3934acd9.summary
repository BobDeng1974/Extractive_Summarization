this week i 'm going back to the @entity1 to create a look inspired by one of the era 's most influential icons @entity6 , with the help of one of my good friends , talented make - up artist @entity10			1
@entity10 created for me a striking yet wearable @entity6 - inspired look with dewy skin , babydoll lashes and faux freckles			1
if you 've got a fancy dress party coming up or simply want to get more creative with your make - up choices , this modern twist on a 60s look is surprisingly not too hard to achieve – here 's how ! to provide a fresh , glowy base and cover any blemishes , @entity10 applied a layer of @entity24 over my face , before moving on to the main focus of the look – the eyes			1
she smudged the line with a small round ended brush to make it softer , and flicked it out slightly towards the outer corners			0
she then took the white highlighter shade from the @entity47 to accentuate the area of my lid under the drawn - on line			0
to make the look modern and wearable , she used a slightly sheerer white highlighter shade , but any white or cream - coloured shadow should do the trick			0
feeling squiffy ? @entity32 was looking a little worse for wear as she headed out with her @entity57 chums last night however her @entity59 makeover sees her looking much more polished to reinforce the eye line , she also dabbed the black eyebrow shade from the @entity63 palette over the pencil			1
next , @entity10 applied the @entity65 very close to my lash line to add further definition			2
i do find liquid liner tricky to use sometimes - if you struggle with it too , simply dot the product over the lash line first for a basic outline and then go over it slowly			0
@entity32 enlisted the help of ex co-star @entity77 to transform her look as well as being one of @entity6 's staple beauty features , defined , doll - like , spiky lashes were all over the @entity83 catwalks			1
@entity10 began by defining my bottom lashes with @entity85 , applying layer after layer until we achieved the desired volume			2
she then applied a fluttery set of falsies to my top lashes followed by a few individual false lashes across my bottom ones , to really make my eyes pop. @entity10 then used the @entity96 under my eyes to cover any eyeshadow or mascara fallout , setting it in place with a translucent powder			2
she deliberately used one shade lighter than my skintone to disguise eye bags and brighten up my eye area , as well as to highlight my nose and @entity107 's bow			0
@entity10 used a high definition mascara to achieve @entity32 's doll - like lashes to achieve a look to mirror @entity6 's @entity10 suggests focusing on the eye area with a smoky palette and heavy eyeliner next , @entity10 added some definition to my face with a light dusting of @entity117 in @entity118 over my cheekbones			1
fresh skin and doe eyes are the two main beauty components forming this look , so even if you 're a tanaholic like myself , try to keep the bronze at bay ! in keeping with @entity6 's usual beauty choices , @entity10 decided to keep my lips muted , enhancing them with a slick of the gorgeous pinky - nude @entity131 in @entity132			1
finally – for an authentic @entity6 - style look , @entity10 dotted some faux freckles across my nose and cheeks using the @entity137 in @entity138 and @entity139 , using varying amounts of pressure to keep them looking natural			1
you can get all the products @entity10 used from @entity144 , and do check out her @entity146 channel for some more amazing beauty tutorials and lifestyle videos			2
make - up : done			0
now to grab my favourite shift dress , perfect my bouffant and hit the town ! hope you all have a fantastic bank holiday weekend			0
lots of love , @entity158 xxx			0
