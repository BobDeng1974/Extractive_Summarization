the @entity0 has already given her seal of approval to @entity4 's new diffusion line , having worn it on the campaign trail in october			1
now finally , just weeks before the january 7 launch , full lookbook images from the @entity9 @entity8 collection have been released			1
the line takes a strong lead from the @entity13 , with retro shifts and ladylike detailing			0
first look : a lookbook for the new miss @entity8 line from @entity4 has finally been released ahead of next month 's launch - though @entity19 wore a piece back in october at an event in @entity22 , @entity23 model @entity24 looks every inch the ingenue in the lookbook images			1
hemlines , waistlines and hemlines are all at the higher end of the scale , striking a balance between flirty and demure			0
prints are key from @entity19 's green pixellated shift to butterflies and op - art rings			0
but the best part , for fans of the designer , is that price points will be significantly lower than the mainline collection			2
ladylike : the designer believes his new lower - priced line will bridge a gap in the market affordable : prices for miss @entity8 start at $ 195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to $ 795 for a black leather jacket prices start at $ 195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to $ 795 for a black leather jacket			1
a garment from the @entity4 collection , meanwhile , averages at about $ 1,700			1
intended to be ' playful and a little younger ' than his main collection , mr @entity4 , 29 , told @entity62 : ' instead of just doing " @entity4 - for-less " , the idea is to explore the other side of myself			2
' i always see @entity4 [ the collection ] as my aesthetic , my design sensibility			2
miss @entity8 is my personality			1
it was really fun to explore that facet of who i am - slightly more downtown , and with a more relaxed attitude			0
' here come the girls ... miss @entity8 is intended to be ' playful and a little younger ' than his main collection prints charming : textiles reign supreme , from polka dots and stripes to butterflies the collection will be available exclusively at @entity82 for its first year - a huge coup for the store			1
@entity85 , the retailer 's executive vice president of designer merchandising , explained : ' there ’s a large audience who wants to wear his clothes			0
' this collaboration has an appeal not just to a younger set of women , but to a broader set of women and at prices that are approachable			2
role play : model @entity24 looks every inch the ingenue in the lookbook images shift in time : the @entity13 silhouette is a style signature for the collection save the date : the collection will be available exclusively at @entity82 from january 7 ' what ’s great is that while feeling different from the @entity4 signature collection , it still clearly has @entity4 ’s design dna			1
' mr @entity4 added that the new line will bridge a much - needed gap in the market			0
' one thing that is rare in the contemporary market is more feminine , girlier clothes , ' he said			0
' it tends to be more hard - edged , or too young			0
i felt this is something that brings a little bit of softness			0

miss @entity8 launches on january 7 at @entity82 , with prices starting at $ 195
the @entity0 wore a piece from the collection to a campaign event in @entity22 , @entity23 in october
