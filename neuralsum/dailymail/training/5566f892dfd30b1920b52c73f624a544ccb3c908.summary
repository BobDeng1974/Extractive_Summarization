by @entity1 reporter the controversial @entity3 free school is to stop teaching secondary pupils from this summer			1
the government has stepped in after an @entity7 report warned that the @entity9 faith school in @entity10 was in chaos , with concerns over teaching quality and the curriculum , amid claims that it was imposing strict @entity17 practices such as forcing women to wear headscarves			1
schools minister @entity20 said : ‘ it would simply not be in the interests of parents or pupils at the secondary school to continue to fund provision which has failed them in the manner now apparent			2
’ he said the move would allow the trust in charge to focus on the primary school			2
faith : the @entity35 in @entity10 , which has shut its doors to secondary pupils after the government stepped in to run it following an @entity7 report which raised concerns over teaching quality and the curriculum the school opened in september 2012 , and within a year was under investigation by the @entity43 over alleged irregularities			1
in october 2013 @entity7 said it was ‘ dysfunctional ’			1
critics have held the situation up as an example of the problems with the coalition 's flagship free schools policy			2
in a letter to the @entity52 , @entity20 said it was ' clear there is a great deal of work to do at the school '			2
' i am particularly concerned at the poor quality of secondary teaching and the lack of breadth in the secondary curriculum , ' he wrote			0
' i have decided it would be in the best interests of those children in the secondary school to continue their education elsewhere from this september onwards			2
' a member of staff at @entity3 : there were claims that it was imposing strict @entity17 practices such as forcing women to wear headscarves a @entity78 spokesman said : ' the vast majority of free schools are performing well but where we have found failure we have acted swiftly and decisively			1
' we have monitored @entity3 very closely since problems came to light last year			1
based on the current situation we believe the new board - which began work last week - needs to focus efforts on the primary school in order to bring about the level of improvement required			2
' the board has accepted our decision to close the secondary school and we have offered our full support in helping pupils to find alternative places before the start of the next academic year			2
' the newly appointed chair of governors @entity99 , brought in by the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) to turn the school around , said the blame lay squarely with the old trust board , which was replaced last week after failing to act			1
he said it was ' absolutely accurate ' to describe the operation of the school , which opened in september 2012 , as amateur			0
mr day , who is also chief executive of the @entity109 , said that the surrounding community still supported @entity3 but had been badly let down by the previous trustees , who failed to make improvements following the highly critical @entity7 report published late last year			1
he said shutting secondary provision would allow the trustees and staff to build the foundations of a good school , and eventually reopen doors to older pupils			0
mr @entity99 added : ' the new trustees took over last friday because the advice about what needed to be done in the school was being ignored by the previous trust and @entity20 took that action so things could actually start moving			0
' i think the closure is a real blow for the local community but it does give the new trust members the chance to turn things around			0
' it is about laying the foundation and i believe because we can focus on building up a new primary for the next three - and - a - half years it now has a much greater chance of being successful			0
' he said there were now less than 140 secondary pupils on the roll and the new governing body had been speaking with the council about finding alternative places for these youngsters			0
mr @entity99 said the dysfunction between the staff and management meant ' many of them ( staff ) felt they could n't do their job because of interference by others '			0
he added : ' every single member of staff wants this school to be successful but there is absolutely no doubt that many of the staff are inexperienced , some of the staff are not qualified and all of them need additional training to make this work			0
' mr @entity99 said his sympathies were with the parents and wider community who had invested a lot of support in the school			0
' i believe they 've been let down by the previous trustees - they 're responsible for the position the school is in and it 's up to myself and the new board and other experts that will come in to drive this forward , ' he said			0
farce : newly appointed chair of governors @entity99 said there was no doubt that many of the staff are inexperienced , some of the staff are not qualified and all of them need additional training ' to make this work ' shadow education secretary @entity189 said : ' this is more evidence that @entity192 's free school programme is damaging education standards in this country			1
' @entity7 judged that @entity3 , one of the prime minister 's flagship free schools , is completely dysfunctional			1
' it has come to symbolise everything that is wrong with the free school programme : unqualified teachers in the classroom and a complete lack of local oversight of these schools			1
' despite the continuing evidence that this programme is damaging standards , the @entity206 - led government is happy to plough on			0
' @entity210 , deputy general secretary of the @entity211 , said : ' once again education secretary @entity212 has a lot of questions to answer about his flagship free school policy			1
' it is becoming increasingly apparent that the process for approving groups to open free schools is inadequate and that in his haste to open these schools , procedures for ensuring that providers deliver the highest standards of education are not in place			0
' the free school programme must be paused so that the lessons of troubled schools such as the @entity230 , @entity3 and the @entity231 can be learned			1
' free schools should be brought within the responsibility of their local authority to ensure proper oversight of both their governance and the standard of education they offer			0

@entity3 free school was mired on controversy when it was claimed that teachers had been forced to wear headscarves
now the @entity78 has stepped in after @entity7 report warned that the faith school is in chaos
