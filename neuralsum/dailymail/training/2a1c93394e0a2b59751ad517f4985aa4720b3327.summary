an eight - year - old boy has left doctors baffled after his hands swelled to giant proportions and now weigh more than two stone			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , is unable to carry out simple tasks , including tying his own shoe laces , after he was born with hands twice the size of an average baby			1
his mother @entity12 , 27 , said she knew he was different at birth but was powerless to help and the youngster 's hands have now grown so large they measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the end of his middle finger			1
he said : ' i do not go to school because the teacher says other kids are scared of my hands			2
' many of them used to bully me for my deformity			0
they would say " let 's beat up the kid with the large hands "			2
' some of them have actually beaten me and would go after me often			0
' i find it difficult to put on my clothes , button my shirt and pull up my pants			0
' but i do n't know if i want doctors to operate on my hands			1
they would have to make me unconscious and then they would cut me open			0
' i have no problem if they could do it without an injection			0
a small operation would be okay			0
' his parents , who earn just Â£ 15 a month , have been desperately trying to find help for their son - but to no avail			0
his mother @entity12 , 27 , ( pictured with @entity5 and another one of her children ) said she feels ' powerless ' @entity5 , a keen cricketer , said the teachers at his school have told him other children are ' scared ' of his hands he has found it difficulty to play cricket and hold a bat due to his condition but tries to still join in with his friends his mother , who has other children who do not suffer from the same condition , said : ' when @entity5 was born his hand was twice the size of a normal baby 's			1
' his hands were big and his fingers were long			2
initially his fists were small but they began to grow large as well and his fingers also kept growing			2
' his father , @entity85 , 45 , who works as a labourer , is worried his son will never be independent and blames himself for not earning enough money			0
' he has difficulty feeding himself because his fist does not bend properly - so we have to feed him , ' he said			0
' using two fingers he is able to pick up some things like a glass of water to drink			0
' we want to take him to the hospital but there have been times when money has been so low that my wife has been forced to go begging			0
' in that kind of financial situation , getting treatment for @entity5 was difficult			1
' even when i tried to get @entity5 into the school , the headmaster told me to put in writing that the school would not be responsible if the other children were afraid of his hands or bullied him or laughed at him			1
' doctors in @entity6 have been left baffled by his growing hands and many are at a loss as to what the condition is the youngster has difficulty eating , tying his shoelaces and carrying out other basic tasks due to his hands @entity5 's father @entity85 , 45 , ( pictured together above ) is worried his son will never become independent the couple have only just been able to take their son to a local doctor for an assessment but their hopes of an instant cure have been dashed			1
dr @entity131 , the director of the local hospital , said : ' as far as my knowledge goes , this is an extremely rare condition			1
' i have not seen a case in medical journals or on the internet where only the hands grew to such a large size			1
' until we have done proper genetic testing we will not be able to say exactly what is causing this deformity			0
' he said that apart from the unsightly growths , @entity5 is in good health - with properly functioning lungs and heart			1
doctors have assessed @entity5 and have described his hands as a ' rare condition '			1
he is otherwise healthy @entity5 was born with larger - than - average hands but they have continued to grow throughout his childhood but as his hands continue to grow it may put increased pressure on his cardiovascular system , potentially shortening his life			1
elsewhere , dr @entity160 , head of paediatrics at the state - of - the - art @entity162 in @entity163 , near @entity164 , has also been left baffled after reviewing photographs and videos of the boy 's hands			2
however , he believes @entity5 may be suffering from either lymphangioma or hamartoma - which are both treatable			2
he added : ' this condition looks very rare and i have come across something like this before			2
without proper examination and medical tests i am not 100 per cent sure about what this is			0
' @entity5 's parents are now hoping to raise money for their son in the hope that his condition can be treated one doctor said he believes the @entity5 may be suffering from either lymphangioma - a condition of the lymphatic system causing extreme inflamation - or hamartoma - a benign tumour - both of which are treatable @entity190 is a condition of the lymphatic system which causes extreme inflammation resulting in doughy masses forming in certain parts of the body			1
@entity197 is a benign type of tumour where the body produces excess tissue			0
after hearing from the doctors , @entity5 's parents now have renewed optimism that something can be done for their son and are doubling their efforts to raise money for him			1
' we have tried several places with no solutions so far , ' said @entity85			0
' but i have a feeling there is a way to get the resources to give my son a normal life			0
