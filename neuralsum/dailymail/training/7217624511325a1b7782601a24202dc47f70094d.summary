by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 11:24 est , 4 march 2014 it ’s 2pm on a drizzly monday and i ’m sitting in a doctor ’s waiting room			2
a selection of well thumbed magazines are strewn across a coffee table and in the corner , a young couple whisper nervously to each other			2
it could be a snapshot from any gp ’s surgery in the land , but for one crucial difference : we all have needles hanging out of our arms , attached to bright yellow iv drips			1
intravenous vitamin infusions – so - called ‘ healthy ’ cocktails pumped straight into the bloodstream to fight fatigue , boost energy levels and sharpen mental performance - are becoming big business			1
earlier this week @entity28 tweeted a photo of herself hooked up to an iv drip before filming her new music video @entity28 posted snaps of her @entity30 on her @entity34 account they ’re the natural evolution of the vitamin injections that have been doing the rounds in the @entity39 since the 1960s , and are being fuelled by a growing celebrity fan base ( @entity28 posted photos of herself hooked up to a vitamin drip two days ago , while @entity44 , @entity45 and even @entity46 are all reputedly devotees )			1
now , specialist clinics offering the procedure - as either a direct injection or the more efficient iv drip - have started appearing across the @entity52 as a quick health fix for the cash - rich , time - poor			1
think about it : in a world where many of us consume most of our five a day from @entity59 containers , is it any wonder a treatment that offers a more direct route to better short - term health , glowing skin and boosted immunity is so sought after ? hooked - up health it ’s not a new trend in some parts of the world			1
in @entity72 , for instance , iv cafes offer entire menus of vitamin drips , from jabs that burn fat to those claiming to boost skin radiance			1
women 's health reveal which jab solves what body issues in their april issue in the @entity39 , the ‘ @entity84 ’ bus has been circling @entity85 for years , offering the burnt - out victims of @entity85 an immediate intravenous pick - me - up			1
just a few months ago , model @entity88 tweeted a picture of herself hooked up to a vitamin drip to help her recover from a cold			1
one of the first to advertise the treatment in the @entity52 was the @entity95 based @entity94 , which has been administering vitamin drips from its @entity98 centre since the start of 2013			1
founder @entity100 says more than 1,000 patients have already paid for the procedure , to the tune of £ 100 to £ 450 per hit			2
' the majority of our clients are high achievers in their late thirties , and it ’s evenly split between the sexes , ' she says			0
' typically , it ’s individuals who work very long hours and travel frequently - people who simply can not afford to get ill. ' @entity100 claims the four iv drips her clinic offers - ranging from immunity and vitality - boosting treatments to an anti ageing cocktail , all containing a blend of minerals such as magnesium , calcium and potassium and vitamins @entity122 and @entity124 - are ' 10,000 times ' better than the benefits you glean from your standard five - a - day diet			1
' the results are phenomenal , ' she says			0
' these infusions make you look younger as well as armour - plating your immune system			1
i have n’t been sick once since i started using them 12 months ago			0
' too much of a good thing the concept of vitamin iv treatments began in the @entity39 more than 50 years ago , when a @entity138 physician named @entity139 invented the @entity140 , containing a combination of vitamins @entity142 , as well as calcium and magnesium to treat a broad range of conditions from muscular strain to chronic fatigue			1
over the past 12 months , the continual drip - drip of celebrity testimonials has been enough for the trend to soak into the public consciousness on this side of the @entity155 , too			1
a preventative solution that does n’t involve spending hours at the gym or your entire life savings in @entity161 ? sounds too good to be true			0
a number of @entity52 health experts have voiced doubts , claiming the drips are at best a serious waste of cash and at worst potentially harmful			1
@entity88 posted an @entity34 photo taken while on an iv drip with girlfriend @entity171 back in january ' when you eat food , your body breaks it down in your digestive system , taking what it needs and creating hormones such as insulin , glucagon and serotonin in the process , ' explains @entity182 , a senior technical adviser at multivitamin company @entity183			1
' ingesting pure vitamins intravenously completely bypasses your body ’s natural checks and measures			0
' @entity190 gp dr @entity189 goes even further			0
' people say you ca n’t have too much of a good thing , but of course you can , ' he warns			0
' a female acquaintance described it as ' feeling like @entity197 for three days afterwards			0
another close male friend said he was " swinging out of bed feeling immediately awake " ' ' vitamins are medically active compounds and , as such , can become toxic in high enough doses			0
if people are feeling tired or run down , they should be looking for answers on a dinner plate , not in an @entity30 ' the real deal ? after 45 minutes in a leather chair attached to a vitamin drip , i can honestly say i feel no different			1
to be fair , @entity100 recommends at least three or four infusions before you can expect to see significant effects , but that would involve a four figure sum - a cash injection i ’m less willing to stomach			1
other celebs who have tried the trend include @entity220 ( left ) and @entity221 of @entity223 star @entity222 ( right ) perhaps my vitamins were already balanced and my stress levels low - after all , i ’d just returned from holiday			1
and there is certainly anecdotal evidence of dramatic success			0

another close male friend tried one during a particularly stressful period and said he was ' swinging out of bed feeling immediately awake ' each morning for six days			0
perhaps it ’s the placebo effect , or perhaps both of them were significantly more run down or vitamin deficient than i was on that rainy monday ( according to the @entity243 , as many as 30 % of adults may be @entity124 deficient ) , but it ’s certainly not a one - shot - suits - all treatment			1
leaving the clinic , i chat briefly to a woman called @entity250 , a vitamin - iv - junkie who i guess is in her mid-thirties			1
' the infusions are fantastic , ' she enthuses			2
' they make you look and feel so young and healthy			0
' faith , it turns out , is 52			0
suddenly , a few hundred pounds does n’t look very expensive at all			0
