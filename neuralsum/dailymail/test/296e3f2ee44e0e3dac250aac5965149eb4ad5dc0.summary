the first dramatic footage of the @entity2 jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery - as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm			1
the six - strong gang dressed in high - vis jackets were captured on @entity10 working throughout thursday night having successfully broken into the basement of the building in the heart of @entity15 ’s jewellery district			1
shockingly , the footage reveals they returned again on saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping			1
@entity32 tonight refused to confirm to @entity33 whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the @entity22 , but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm			1
the footage begins at 9.23pm – just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit centre lock up for the @entity43 weekend – as the first thief appears on camera carrying a black bin bag			2
it was unclear exactly where the cameras were situated , but at least one is aimed outside the building and shows a white van thought to be the getaway vehicle			0
over the following four nights , half a dozen raiders are seen lugging heavy - duty tools , including massive bolt cutters and a red monkey wrench down to the secure vault			2
each member of the gang is wearing builder ’s overalls and high - visibility vests			1
at least one has a balaclava over his face , while others wear dust masks – but each one is partially reconisable			0
the first raider to appear has been dubbed mr @entity72 after the colour of his hair			0
another , wearing a builder ’s hat , has been referred to as mr @entity78 and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond - tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault			1
the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault the @entity89 – who wears an @entity91 tracksuit – carries two red tools up and down the stairs			2
another , dubbed the @entity95 because of his grey hair , later appears to struggle for breath in the footage as he lugs bags from the vault			2
two other raiders have been nicknamed @entity101 , for his smart brown shoes , and mr @entity104 because he is wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word			0
reports say that he has a shaved head , and possibly an earring in his left ear			0
at about 9.40pm the gang disappear into the building			2
at 7.52am on @entity116 , according to the footage , members of the gang can be seen again			1
the street camera captures the white @entity118 pull up to the alley			0
on sunday , at around 6am , the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs			1
it has been reported these contained potentially millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables			2
the last trace of the raiders is recorded at 6.44am on @entity129 , when a white van pulls up and the gang load it with all the remaining equipment and disappear			2
detective chief inspector @entity134 of the @entity135 , speaks to journalists outside @entity137 today following last weekend 's burglary in @entity15 another suspect , riding a moped , may also be connected to the gang			2
the raid was not discovered until the following tuesday the thieves apparently thought they had covered all their bases when covering their footsteps , but had failed to realise they had missed the cameras			0
a source told the mirror : ' this was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail			1
' but they may have made a mistake in leaving this footage behind			0
' the footage came to light as @entity32 was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation			1
that failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over @entity43 and escape with gems and cash worth ‘ millions and millions ’ from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video			1
officers were informed that the warning had been triggered shortly after midnight on @entity116			0
but they decided that the possibility of a burglary did not need immediate investigation			0
instead , a private security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the building			0
last night , jewellers who rent boxes with the @entity182 security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company			1
one jeweller , a 63 - year - old named @entity188 , said : ‘ as far as i ’m concerned the police have got a lot to answer for			1
suing anyone is a last resort but it ’s something i would consider			0
’ a gang of criminals broke into the @entity137 over the @entity197 weekend another jeweller called @entity199 , who runs a business with his father in @entity2 , added : ‘ it is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company			1
’ the deposit firm has also faced criticism over the building ’s ‘ antiquated ’ alarm system			0
security expert @entity211 , 47 , said : ‘ it was a well - planned heist , but the lack of modern technology made it a lot less difficult than it should have been			0
’ a @entity32 spokesman said : ‘ a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required			1
we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call			0
‘ it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident			0
