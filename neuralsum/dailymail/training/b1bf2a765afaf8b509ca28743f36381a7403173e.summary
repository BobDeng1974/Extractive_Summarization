these two slender figures , clad in sumptuous clothing and wearing pearls round their necks , would be utterly typical for the period - except for the fact that one of them is black			0
the mysterious picture seems to show the two women as equal , despite hailing from an era of huge racial prejudice , when @entity17 still bought and sold @entity18 in a booming slaving industry			0
intriguing : this 1779 portrait , by @entity20 , shows @entity22 , seemingly the equal of her playmate @entity23 and now , rather than being an oddity , it has emerged that @entity22 - the poised , dark - skinned figure in the portrait - could have played an instrumental part the @entity17 's historic move to abolish the slave trade for good			2
miss @entity22 , who was taken in by an influential judge and raised almost like one of his family , could have helped sway the mind of her guardian in a landmark series of legal cases which found against avaricious slavers , and helped to end the trade for good			1
the director of a new film - @entity22 - depicting her unusual life has spoken of the influence @entity45 must have had over @entity46 , 1st @entity47 , who looked after her			1
legal champion : @entity46 , 1st @entity49 , ruled against slavers in a series of rulings lord @entity46 , who was lord chief justice ( one of the country 's most senior judges ) , took @entity22 in at the request of his nephew , her father - and went on to make landmark rulings against slave traders , which set the stage for the abolitionist movement			1
speaking to the @entity65 , @entity66 , the director of @entity22 , said : ' i think it would be disingenuous to believer her presence in the house did n't have some impact on him			0
it makes or a fascinating story to think that his love for his child opened his eyes			0
' the film , which is released in the @entity17 this june , was inspired by the intriguing portrait , which shows miss @entity22 posing with her playmate , @entity23 , a contemporary who was also under lord @entity46 's care			1
miss @entity22 , born in 1761 , was the illegitimate daughter of lord @entity46 's nephew , @entity86 , who was a respected captain in the @entity87			1
her mother is thought to have been an @entity18 slave who was captured from a @entity91 trip while mr @entity86 was serving in the @entity92			2
she was placed into lord @entity46 's care as a child , and was raised at @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , where her presence shocked well - to - do visitors			1
one outraged visitor , a governor of @entity100 , then a @entity17 colony , wrote an astonished diary entry , noting that @entity46 has been ' reproached for shewing a fondness for her			0
' big screen : a new film , called @entity22 , will tell her unusual story			2
@entity107 , pictured above in character , plays miss @entity22 indeed , miss @entity22 was allowed to lead a relatively privileged life - although she did not eat with the family - and married a junior lawyer			0
lord @entity46 's will would eventually confirm her freedom			2
but it was while under his care as a child , and later a young woman , that lord @entity46 struck two major blows against the slave trade			2
the first , in 1772 , was part of a series of wrangles about the legal status of slavery , which had been tolerated and accepted by courts despite the lack of an actual law to make slave - owning legal			0
high - class : miss @entity22 was raised at @entity94 in @entity96 , where visitors were shocked at her presence lord @entity46 declared that it was in fact illegal for a slave owner to force a reluctant slave to leave the country with him			1
he said that the fact that slave - master relationships were commonplace was not a good enough reason - and left open the possibility that owners may have no legal rights over their slaves at all			0
later , in 1781 , he made another ruling which threw out an a claim by slave ship owners who threw men and women overboard to drown , then tried to claim their value back on insurance			0
but lord @entity46 ruled that the owners of the @entity153 - a slave ship travelling from @entity18 to @entity155 - had been wrong to jettison the slaves in the hope of claiming their value back , and described the condition of slavery as ' odious ' in his judgment			1
the case - closely watched by @entity163 campaigners - helped fuel the movement to end the slave trade , which was eventually outlawed by @entity166 in 1807			1
in 1833 a further law was passed freeing all existing slaves .			0

think she may have *softened* heart of her guardian , the @entity47
lord @entity46 , the lord chief justice made landmark *anti-slaver* rulings
cases helped fuel the abolition movement - which outlawed slavery in 1833
