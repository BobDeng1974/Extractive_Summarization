his proud parents had suffered the heartache of two miscarriages and a failed attempt at @entity10 before hearing about the innovative technique in which music is played to eggs in a dish			1
studies suggest that the tiny vibrations produced by music give fertilisation a helping hand			1
@entity19 is the first @entity3 baby to be born thanks to a musical fertility treatment @entity2 is now one , and his parents , @entity22 and @entity23 , say he seems to have a natural love of music			2
the couple , from @entity26 , said : ‘ from early on we noticed he was hugely drawn to music			0
he always loved being sung to and seemed more relaxed when music was being played			2
‘ we hope that when we tell @entity2 about the musical element of his beginnings it will help him feel extra-special			2
’ @entity2 ’s mother became pregnant with him after travelling to @entity32 for treatment at the @entity35 fertility clinic where researchers are studying whether playing music in @entity10 labs boosts the odds of fertilisation			1
they injected sperm into almost 1,000 eggs and put them in dishes in incubators			2
they then placed speakers in half the incubators and played music round the clock			2
the playlist included pop songs by @entity52 and @entity53 , heavier tracks from @entity55 and @entity56 and classical works by @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
as expected , not all of the eggs were fertilised			0
but , to their surprise , they found that fertilisation rates were around five per cent higher in the incubators in which music had been played			1
studies suggest that the tiny vibrations produced by music give fertilisation a helping hand pop , heavy metal and classical music appeared to work equally well			1
embryos do n’t develop the ability to detect sound for at least 14 weeks , so it is thought that the vibrations produced by the music are key			1
they are believed to ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste , so increasing the odds of fertilisation taking place and the fledgling embryo surviving			1
in natural conception , the fertilised egg is rocked as it rolls down the fallopian tube			0
it is also subjected to gentle contractions in the womb			0
it is too early to say if the musical technique boosts the odds of giving birth but couples in 17 countries , including the @entity3 , have become parents thanks to it			0
@entity2 ’s loves nothing more than turning the knobs of a large radio that is put beside him when he plays on the floor			0
it is thought the vibrations created by music ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste , so increasing the odds of fertilisation taking place his parents , who spent four years trying for a family before travelling to @entity116 , said : ‘ we were utterly overjoyed when we discovered that we had been successful			1
after all our earlier disappointments , it was hard to actually believe that everything would be all right – but it was			0
‘ we were amazed to learn that our son had been the first born in the @entity3 using the technique			0
‘ this was a very exciting discovery for us , as we are both huge music lovers			0
’ @entity116 researcher @entity125 added that there is no harm in those trying to conceive naturally playing music			1
she said : ‘ music is beneficial for everything			0

@entity2 was conceived thanks to an @entity10 technique which *involves* playing music to eggs which are being fertilised artificially in a lab
fertilisation rates are 5 *%* higher in incubators where music is played
embryos do n’t develop the ability to hear for at least 14 weeks , so it is thought that the vibrations produced by the music are key
they ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste
