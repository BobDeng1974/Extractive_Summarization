we all eat the same fat and the same sweets , ' he said			0
@entity9 also insisted that he would use ' humbler ' types of fish because they often posed more of a challenge than higher - class fare			2
comparing a sardine to the more prestigious turbot , he said that cooking the former required almost ' surgical skills '			0
' the humbler the product , the more attention it demands , ' he said			0
signature dishes on the menu in 2012 : signature dishes on the new menu - smoked swordfish and @entity4 bacon on toast - black rice cooked in the oven with shellfish - @entity95 legs beignets with a sorrel dipping sauce - @entity97 and octopus - - @entity101 fowl pie - @entity47 monkfish mixed with bulgar - @entity104 's milk cheese , caramel and @entity106 with shellfish ' in this case it 's 15 per cent sardine and 85 per cent work			1
' most of the organic cereals and vegetables served at the restaurant , which reopens on monday , will be grown in the gardens of the @entity116 , built by @entity118 's ' @entity117 ' @entity117			0

two years later , he was approached by the @entity14 with an offer to take over the gloriously ornate @entity136 restaurant			0
