eat well : researchers reviewed 16 studies involving more than 830,000 people and confirmed that five portions appeared best eating more than five portions of fruit and vegetables a day wo n’t help you live any longer , claim researchers			1
a major study shows that five a day is the optimum for reducing the chances of dying at any age – especially from heart problems – but that eating additional fruit and veg is unlikely to make a difference			1
it comes after a call by some experts in march for the five - a - day message to be revised upwards to seven - a - day because of @entity22 research by @entity23 suggesting that it led to the lowest risk of premature death			1
in the latest study , researchers from @entity27 and @entity28 in the @entity29 reviewed 16 studies involving more than 830,000 people and confirmed that five portions appeared best			1
the review , published on @entity32 , found that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables was significantly associated with a lower risk of death from all causes , particularly cardiovascular problems			2
the average risk of death from all causes was reduced by about five per cent for each additional daily serving of fruit and vegetables compared with eating none			2
but once a person had consumed five portions , eating more did not enhance survival chances			0
the maximum achievable cut in premature death risk was around 25 per cent			0
the standard portion was defined as 77g for vegetables and 80g for fruit			0
just one in four @entity22 manages to eat five portions a day , with the proportion plummeting to one in ten among teenagers			1
the review says : ‘ this analysis provides further evidence that a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of all - cause mortality , particularly cardiovascular mortality			1
‘ there was a threshold around five servings of fruit and vegetables a day , after which the risk of all cause mortality did not reduce further			1
’ the researchers speculate that eating more does not produce greater benefits because the body can not absorb any more nutrients , and there ’s a limit on the digestibility of fruit and vegetables			2
professor @entity73 , of the @entity74 , @entity75 , said the finding should not put people off eating plenty of fruit and vegetables			0
the researchers speculate that eating more does not produce greater benefits because the body can not absorb any more nutrients , and there ’s a limit on the digestibility of fruit and vegetables women who eat healthily and exercise while going through a divorce or other stressful periods , are more likely to avoid premature ageing , says a study			2
the key , say scientists , lies in our telomeres – biological caps at the ends of chromosomes that protect the dna in them from damage			0
as we get older , our telomeres get shorter			0
@entity29 scientists took blood samples from 250 women aged 50 to 65 to measure their telomeres and investigated their lifestyles			0
‘ those who exercised , slept well and ate well had less telomere shortening than the ones who did n’t maintain healthy lifestyles , even when they had similar levels of stress , ’ researcher @entity105 , of the @entity106 , told the journal @entity108 .			0

in march experts asked for *guidelines* to be revised upwards to seven - a - day
but researchers from the *university* and @entity27 say five is still fine
