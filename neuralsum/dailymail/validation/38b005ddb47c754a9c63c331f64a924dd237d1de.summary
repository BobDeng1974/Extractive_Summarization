@entity0 is ' alive ' but ' neutralised ' as shadowy security chiefs stage a stealthy coup in @entity4 , it was claimed last night			1
former @entity6 chief @entity5 was behind the plot , claimed chairman of the @entity9 , @entity10			0
there have been no confirmed sightings of @entity0 for nine days , while in the febrile atmosphere engulfing @entity4 a convoy of large trucks parked outside the @entity16 fueled rumours of a flit by the president			1
despite this , bloggers likened it to @entity43 leader @entity42 's treasure - grab as he fled into exile just over a year ago in @entity45			0
' i think that @entity0 is neutralised at the moment , but of course , he is alive , ' said @entity10 , seen as a @entity16 loyalist			1
' he is under the control of the power - wielding agencies , who have , in my opinion , organised a coup d'etat			0
' recent pictures of @entity0 supposedly working during a nine day absence from public sight was ' playing for time ' by the plotters , he claimed			1
' my information is that @entity5 met @entity61 leader @entity60 in @entity62 on 11 march and tempted him over to his side			1
' he also pointed to a recent visit by patrushev - head of @entity0 's security council - the @entity68			1
the visit came despite sanctions barring visits by most senior @entity21 officials			1
' i think he was offered something there that he failed to reject , ' said @entity10 on @entity76 tv channel @entity75			0
several large trucks were parked near @entity79 fueling rumours connected with @entity0 's absence @entity0 has not been seen in public for nine days which has caused certain consternation in @entity21 @entity0 failed to reappear again on saturday - the ninth day without a confirmed sighting - as his @entity61 enforcer suggested the @entity21 strongman is in danger of being overthrown			1
@entity60 - a devout muslim whose security apparatchiks are seen as being behind the brutal murder of @entity91 - said he would remain devoted to the @entity16 leader ' whether he is in his position or not '			0
this came amid a claim that pictures issued by the @entity16 on friday of @entity0 meeting @entity98 head @entity97 may date from 2011			1
the images were rushed out in a bid to show @entity0 is still at work , and followed the release of other photographs which had been taken on or before 5 march when he was last seen in public			1
with feverish speculation in @entity4 over @entity0 's health and whereabouts , and claims of a bitter power struggle in his entourage which could even trigger an attempted coup , the head of @entity61 spoke emotionally of people ' trying to harm the president of @entity21 - and @entity21 itself '			1
and he claimed that forces were scheming ' to break us apart ' , referring to him and his guarantor @entity0			2
as startling has been the lack of shows of support in recent days from other senior @entity16 cardinals during an absence which has no obvious parallel in his 15 years as president or premier			0
the voices of prime minister @entity129 , defence minister @entity130 , chief of the @entity16 staff @entity131 - and @entity0 's intelligence tsars - have remained silent			2
@entity60 has enjoyed extraordinary power and largesse under @entity0 as a reward for keeping an iron grip on the rebellious oil - rich @entity61 region , scene of two bloody wars since the collapse of the @entity143			2
as a result he is hated by many senior @entity0 loyalists			2
but @entity60 's enemies claimed yesterday that the 38 year old bearded regional potentate is in ' panic ' because he can no longer contact his mentor			0
' he is phoning anyone he can in an attempt to arrange a talk with @entity0 - but he fails , ' alleged a website linked to @entity155 hardliners seeking to overthrow @entity60			2
one of the two men formally charged with killing opposition leader @entity91 is a personal friend of @entity60 , who spoke out in his support for the second time yesterday			0
' i 'll repeat now that i knew him as a true warrior and patriot , ' he said of @entity163 , who is accused of murder			0
there are allegations that a security official closer to @entity60 ordered the @entity91 murder , and that the @entity6 and @entity169 in @entity4 have full proof			0
his slaying has triggered bitter factional infighting in the @entity16 , which includes talk of defence and security service generals seeking to replace @entity0			2
others believe @entity0 will reemerge tomorrow to stamp his authority once more on his government			2
there were also unverified claims last week that @entity0 's alleged girlfriend , @entity182 gymnast @entity181 , 31 , had given birth to a child in @entity185			0
this was denied by the @entity16			0
the political chaos in @entity4 comes after @entity189 sanctions and a low oil price have caused mayhem to the @entity21 economy , with a serious fall in the rouble			0
many of the clans in @entity0 's entourage became hugely rich under his rule , but now face their fortunes evaporating			0
software experts in @entity21 yesterday suggested the pictures of @entity0 meeting @entity25 , supposedly taken friday , were created in 2011 and modified a year later			1
but @entity0 is shown in front of the presidential flag , though he was not head of state in 2011			1

@entity0 is supposed to hold public meetings on *monday*
the @entity21 leader has not been seen in public for the past nine days
@entity0 *reportedly* met the head of the @entity98 on friday for talks
however , the video is now believed to have been taken from file footage
