the @entity0 have clinched the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in their history after agreeing a £ 3.6million contract over three years with @entity4			1
@entity5 exclusively revealed last year that @entity4 had agreed to pay £ 20m over four years for the naming rights of @entity7 — and that the telecommunications giant would follow that up with a deal to have their trademarks on the famous dark blue jersey			1
now that has come to fruition and , come the summer , they will take over from ousted backers @entity16			2
the @entity0 insisted the combination of the initial @entity4 investment coupled with the new cash injection from the strip deal had already started to transform @entity22 rugby			1
the @entity24 shirt , worn here by @entity26 , will have @entity4 on it rather than @entity16 from the summer ‘ i am delighted @entity4 will be the new strip partner of the @entity22 teams and although i can not confirm how much the deal is worth as it is commercially sensitive , i can confirm it is the largest ever shirt sponsorship deal we have done , ’ said @entity27 , the @entity0 ’s director of commercial operations , communications and public affairs			1
‘ @entity4 is now very much under the skin of @entity22 rugby and their cash has allowed us to invest in a way we have not been able to ever before			1
their brand will now be seen by millions of fans around the world on the iconic dark blue jersey of the @entity22 team , which shows their further commitment and desire to help us develop all elements of our game			2
’ all form of jersey advertising is banned during the forthcoming @entity54 in @entity55 later this year but @entity22 will have @entity4 branding on their training tops			1
the @entity0 say that the @entity22 under - 20 side will be the first team to run out with @entity4 on their jerseys when they compete in the @entity61 in june and the senior side will first wear the logo on their jerseys during their @entity54 warm - up fixture against @entity66 in august			1
the @entity22 women ’s team will also wear the national jersey with the @entity4 logo on it as will all age - grade sides			1
@entity27 said the cash was being spent from pro level down to the grassroots , with clubs all over @entity22 set to benefit under the long - term sponsorship deals			0
a general view of @entity7 in @entity77 ahead of an @entity78 match in february ‘ @entity4 ’s initial investment was around @entity81 and @entity77 when they became their principal shirt partners , ’ he continued			0
‘ since then , that investment has gone into @entity22 rugby to enhance and develop both those brands and help pay to bring in new players and bring on younger ones			0
‘ you can see the success of @entity81 who are sitting top of the @entity94 table and part of that is a result of their investment			0
@entity77 are going for a place in the @entity101 final and that will be live on @entity103 on friday night			0
there is a demonstration at the partnership in action			0
‘ at club level you have seen clubs participate in the @entity110 and @entity111			0
they are also dipping in to the funds for clubs we have set up to enhance their premises and pitches that has around £ 400,000 a year available and we are going through the new applications for money just now			0
’ @entity27 added that bringing on the next generation of @entity22 rugby players was vital , which was why much of the cash would be spent setting up and running regional rugby academies over the duration of the @entity4 deal			2
one has already been created in @entity127 with others to follow to cover @entity77 and @entity81 as well as the @entity129			0
@entity130 , director of bt @entity22 , added : ‘ this will showcase our partnership on a global stage and demonstrates our support of @entity0			2
