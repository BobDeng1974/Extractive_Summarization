it may have been the slowest chase ever when a tortoise attempted to run down a television presenter who interrupted it having sex with its mate			1
@entity6 - who hosts @entity8 's @entity7 - was on @entity9 , north of @entity10 , when he heard an animal call , which he described as a ' blowing sound '			1
as he walked towards the strange noise , it soon became apparent @entity15 and his cameraman had stumbled upon a male and female tortoise mating			1
as @entity15 and his cameraman stop and try to observe the ritual , the giant tortoises stop mating			1
the presenter said he did not know whether or not they had stopped because of their close proximity or they had finished			0
the animals are seen touching noses as @entity15 and his cameraman watch from behind bushes			2
he was on @entity9 - north of @entity10 - when the incident happened during filming @entity15 and his cameraman were there taping for his @entity8 show , @entity47 the host heard a ' blowing sound ' while he was walking the island and went towards , discovering the tortoises almost immediately the male tortoise spots them and slowly begins to turn himself around , pointing himself in the direction of the television crew			1
the animal then starts to make its way towards them , with as much gusto as it can muster			0
@entity15 is heard telling his cameraman , ' do n't move ' , as it becomes apparent the tortoise is after them			2
as the reptile gets closer and closer to the camera , he shows no sign of stopping and so the cameraman jumps back			0
what ensues is a very low speed chase where the tortoise tries to defend his territory and take a bite out of @entity15			2
the male tortoise slowly turned around to start running after the pair who were startled by the move humouring the reptile , @entity15 continued to slowly back away from it instead of running , observing its behaviour @entity15 said it was the male tortoise 's way of protecting his territory and getting him away from the female later , the host said the tortoise had ended up chasing them for about 365 metres in a circle ' this is the male saying , " hey i think you 've interrupted my mating session " , ' @entity15 told the audience as the tortoise inches closer			1
' you ca n't blame him he 's in the bushes over there mating on this beautiful , private island and i pitch up to take a look			0
' @entity15 continued to humour the tortoise instead of running away			0
he said it was completely relentless in his pursuit , chasing them around in a 365 - metre - loop .			0
