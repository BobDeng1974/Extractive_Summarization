but the headmistress at one primary school has issued a fashion clampdown – on frilly socks			1
elaborate ‘ princess socks ’ , decorated with frills , bows and ribbons , are considered a ‘ trip hazard ’			2
any pupil who flouts the rules will be told to replace them with another pair from @entity20			2
a playground craze has seen pupils wearing increasingly elaborate ' princess ' socks decorated with frills , bows and ribbons			2
but they have been banned at @entity27 , in @entity28 headmistress @entity29 turned against the flowery footwear after a pupil fell over - and sent a letter home to the parents of the 438 pupils , citing health and safety fears			1
she imposed a blanket ban on frills larger than 3cm the ban at @entity27 in @entity28 came after one girl suffered a fall which was judged – in a health and safety assessment form – to have been caused by the garments			1
parent @entity46 , 42 , started the playground craze by making them for her six - year - old daughter @entity49			1
they proved so popular she made hundreds of pairs for her daughter ’s classmates , which she sells for £ 2.50 a pair			0
the cleaner has now accused school officials of going ‘ health and safety mad ’			1
‘ my daughter could fall and break her arm doing @entity63 , but she ’s not allowed to wear frilly socks ? ‘ it ’s a joke – shoelaces are a million times more dangerous than the socks , ’ she said			2
' the parents of more than 400 pupils were told that frills larger than 3cm ( 1.1ins ) were banned following an incident in the playground			0
however , mother - of - three mrs @entity46 says the fall was not caused by the socks – and many parents are defying the ban			1
any child found now breaching the order will be forced to change into a plain pair bought from @entity20 , and parents given a ‘ reminder ’ letter			0
headmistress @entity29 said it was clear the items were a ‘ trip hazard ’			0
