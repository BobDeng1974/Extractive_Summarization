the @entity14 of @entity15 , which oversees the addition of official new words to the @entity7 lexicon , had lined up ogooglebar for inclusion in an official list of new words , defined as ' something that can not be found on the web using a search engine '			1
but it reckoned without the might of @entity5 , which demanded that the wording be amended			0
it insisted that its trademark should not be diluted by being used to apply to all searching of the internet			0
instead , lawyers said the definition should be ' something that can not be found on the web using @entity5 '			2
the search giant also wanted its trademark sign added			0
the council refused to bow to the demand , and simply dropped the word from its list of new additions instead			0
in a statement , the council 's director @entity43 said : ' @entity5 asked the @entity14 to amend the definition of the word			2
do n't use our name in vain ! lawyers acting for @entity5 chief executive @entity51 , pictured during a news conference in @entity53 , instructed the @entity54 to amend the definition of ' ungoogleable ' ' today , we instead are deleting the word , marking our displeasure with @entity5 's attempts to control the language			1
' the term had become a notable new use or neologism during 2012 , the council had said , alongside emoji , emoticons used in instant messages ; drinkorexi , an eating disorder involving barely eating while drinking alcohol instead ; and conversesjukan , or @entity70 disease , bad feet or posture caused by wearing trendy trainers			0
' marking our displeasure ' : @entity43 of the @entity54 said it should not be up to @entity5 to dictate how language evolves a statement on the @entity14 of @entity15 's website , asks : ' who decides language ? we do , language users			1
we decide together which words should be and how they are defined , used and spelled			0
' in response , a @entity5 spokesman told the @entity85 : ' while @entity5 , like many businesses , takes routine steps to protect our trademark , we are pleased that users connect the @entity5 name with great search results			2

@entity54 wants to *introduce* phrase ' ogooglebar '
term for *un-googleable* was to mean ' can not be found on search engine '
but @entity5 said the word should only apply to @entity5 , not any others
@entity7 language *experts* then dropped the phrase
