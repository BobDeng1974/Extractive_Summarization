despite the successes of recent @entity2 blockbusters with strong female leads - from @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , to @entity7 , bridesmaids and @entity9 and the @entity11 - speaking roles for women in cinema have hit a five - year low , with men now being given more than 70 per cent of speaking roles in films			1
and the female roles most likely to be given words to say are those of teenagers showing a lot of skin , according to a study by the @entity24			1
among the 100 highest - grossing films at the 2012 @entity27 box office , only 28.4 per cent of the 4,475 speaking characters were female - a ratio of 2.51 males to every one female on screen - a figure which has fallen from 32.8 per cent three years ago			1
despite the successes of films with strong female leads , such as @entity4 starring @entity38 , female speaking parts in @entity2 have hit a five - year low the report , lead by communication professor @entity42 , declared that ' females are grossly underrepresented on screen in 2012 films ' , and that only ' 6 per cent of the top - grossing films in 2012 featured a balanced cast , or females in 45 to 54.9 per cent of all speaking roles '			1
and when they are on screen , 31 per cent of women in 2012 were shown with at least some exposed skin , and 31.6 per cent were depicted wearing sexually - revealing clothing			1
professor @entity54 said : ' the last few years have seen a wealth of great advocacy for more women on screen			0
unfortunately , that investment has not yet paid off with an increase in female characters or a decrease in their hypersexualization			0
' the study also found that the majority of all female roles are written for 21 to 39 - year - olds			1
the study found that the majority of all female roles are for 21 to 39 - year - olds , such as 23 - year - old @entity69 , pictured here in @entity5 females in the top - grossing films of 2012 are more likely than males to be shown in ' sexy ' clothes - 31.6 per cent compared with seven per cent - or partially naked - 31 per cent compared with 9.4 per cent			1
and actresses aged 13 to 20 are more likely to be shown in either of these states than those aged 21 to 39 or 40 to 64			0
the samples also found that the proportion of teenage females in alluring apparel has increased by 22 per cent between 2009 and 2012			0
behind the camera things are not much better			0
a mere 16.7 per cent of the 1,228 directors , writers , and producers are female across the 100 top - grossing films of 2012			2
women accounted for 4.1 per cent of directors , 12.2 per cent of writers , and 20 per cent of producers - a ratio of five males to every one female behind the camera			2
@entity54 added : the under representation of females on screen is surprising given population and movie attendance patterns			0
girls and women represent fully half of the @entity27 population and buy half of the movie tickets sold			2
