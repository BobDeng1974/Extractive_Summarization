by @entity1 reporter published : 19:13 est , 26 may 2012 updated : 19:14 est , 26 may 2012 education officials are investigating claims that a school broke rules to coach pupils in advance about a crucial national curriculum exam			1
the @entity9 has seen dozens of examples of coursework from children attending @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , which suggest they were told in advance about the contents of the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) writing paper recently taken by ten and 11 - year - olds across the country			1
schools can open the exam paper only one hour before the test is due to begin , and teachers are forbidden from coaching children			2
the @entity9 has seen dozens of examples of coursework from children attending @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , which suggest they were told in advance about the contents of the @entity19 a complaint was first investigated by the @entity31 in march and the school was cleared			1
now another claim is being probed by the standards and @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , the executive body of the @entity38 which is responsible for the @entity19 exams			0
copies of work from children ’s exercise books , which were passed to @entity9 by a source , reveal they were asked to complete several pieces of creative writing both in classrooms and as homework from march this year			0
the exam paper – which the pupils sat on may 15 – contained instructions to complete similar pieces of work			0
the allegations are particularly harmful because the school ’s headmistress , @entity55 , is training to be an inspector with the schools ’ regulator , @entity58			1
the source said : ‘ teachers were told to let pupils watch @entity64 videos on very specific subjects and to prepare @entity67 presentations for them so they were fully informed			0
’ the first allegations were investigated by the @entity69 of @entity14			0
a spokesman said : ‘ a thorough investigation of a previous allegation of “ coaching ” very firmly concluded that there was absolutely no substance to the claims and no case for the school to answer			2
' the headteacher at @entity80 is someone in whom the local authority has real confidence			2

claims are particularly *damaging* to the @entity15 school as the headteacher is training to be an inspector
