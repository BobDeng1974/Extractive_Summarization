at 11 weeks old , this kitten has had enough drama to last him nine lives			1
after apparently wandering off from his owners , the ginger pet ended up being shot in the head by thugs			1
when he was found in a garden , he was starving and at death ’s door			2
remarkably , however , the kitten – named @entity14 after @entity15 ’s ginger - haired friend @entity14 – is now on the road to recovery thanks to a local vet			1
survivor : @entity14 the kitten has made a miraculous recovery after being shot through the eye safe : @entity14 is being cared for by foster owner @entity22 , who has appealed for his owners to come forward a 5mm airgun pellet had narrowly missed his eye and is still lodged in his neck			1
@entity26 , of @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , said : ‘ if it had been a centimetre either way it could have been a lot worse			2
close call : an x-ray shows the lodged pellet in the kitten 's neck ‘ the pellet could have hit his eye or the soft tissue close to his brain			1
he ’s very lucky that it did n’t cause any long - term damage			2
‘ when he was brought in , he was in a bad way – very thin , because he had n’t eaten in quite a few days			2
' we examined his mouth and found a wound and found the hole next to his eye and worked out that he had been shot			1
‘ we could feel there was a lump under his chin , which is probably the pellet and inflammation , but decided that he was too young to operate on and because it was n’t causing him any trouble at the moment , we could wait until he was a bit older			1
‘ we syringe - fed him and the next day he was a lot better , even quite playful			0
he ’s a lovely little thing			0
’ @entity62 , cat re-homing coordinator at the @entity64 ’s @entity63 , @entity28 and @entity65 , said : ‘ it ’s dreadful			0
i did n’t think he would survive it			0
‘ i ca n’t understand how anyone can shoot a baby animal			0
i ca n’t get my head around it , but at least he is safe now and will be getting lots of tender loving care			0
’ @entity14 is now recuperating with foster carer @entity22 and will be offered for adoption if his owners fail to come forward			1
she said : ‘ he ’s doing brilliantly now			0
he is the most loving kitten you could ever meet , he loves to be fussed over and purrs his head off			2
‘ he does n’t appear to be in any pain , which is great considering what happened to him			0
you could n’t print what i want to say about the people who did it			0
