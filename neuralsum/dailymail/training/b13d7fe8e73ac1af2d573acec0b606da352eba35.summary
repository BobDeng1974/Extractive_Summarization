by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor first minister @entity2 was mauled during last week 's tv independence debate over his refusal to spell out a ' @entity5 ' if @entity6 refuses to allow @entity7 to use the pound @entity2 is ' running out of opportunities ' to win next month 's independence referendum it was claimed today - as a new poll showed a huge lead for the ' no ' camp			1
a survey , carried out amid the fallout from last week ’s tv showdown between mr @entity2 and the former chancellor @entity18 , gives the @entity20 campaign a 22 - point lead over the nationalists			1
the findings come just five weeks before voters north of the border go to the polls in the september 18 referendum			1
more than 1,100 @entity7 were asked their voting intentions between monday and thursday last week – coinciding with tuesday ’s independence debate			1
according to the @entity32 poll , published in the @entity33 today , some 55 per cent of @entity7 voters now plan to vote no to independence , compared to just 35 per cent who plan to vote @entity36			1
but once the ‘ do n’t knows ’ are stripped out , the no camp lead by 61 to 39 per cent			1
polling expert @entity38 , of @entity32 , said mr @entity2 was running out of time to turn his poll ratings around			0
he said : ‘ @entity36 campaigners had hoped that the @entity42 would have narrowed the gap and it has n’t			0
‘ with five weeks to go and a 20 point no lead to overturn , the @entity45 campaign need a game - changer and are running out of opportunities			1
’ better together campaign director @entity49 added : ' @entity2 's failure to be honest with @entity7 about his @entity5 on currency is costing him votes			1
' it 's clear that the momentum in this campaign is with those of us who believe the brightest future for @entity7 is to remain part of the @entity20			1
' @entity2 wants us to take a leap into the unknown with independence			1
he wants us to take a huge risk with the future of our country			0
yet he ca n't tell us what money our wages , pensions and benefits would be paid in			0
' he ca n't say what currency we would use to invest in our schools and hospitals			0
and he ca n't be clear about what money we would be paying our supermarket and energy bills in			0
' mr @entity18 , the leader of the @entity76 campaign , added : ‘ this is yet another encouraging poll			2
‘ however , we are in no way complacent			0
there are just six weeks to go and we will be fighting for every vote			1
‘ what is clear , though , is that the closer we get the more people are looking at the nationalists plans and realising that they make no sense			0
’ but a spokesman for @entity45 said : ‘ this poll is unchanged from the last @entity32 poll in june			0
‘ two other polls in the past week have shown support for @entity36 as high as 47 per cent — including the snap poll conducted after last week ’s debate			1
’ ‘ yes vote is @entity7 ’s one opportunity to protect the @entity94 from @entity6 privatisation , create more jobs in @entity7 , and transform childcare instead of wasting billions of pounds on @entity99 nuclear weapons			2
’ today ’s @entity32 poll also showed that 39 per cent of @entity7 believed there should not be another referendum if @entity45 votes no. just a quarter of @entity7 believe say there should be another poll within a decade , while 17 per cent say it should not be for at least another 20 or 30 years			2
@entity2 , the first minister of scotland , and @entity18 , the chairman of @entity76 , took part in a live television debate hosted by @entity111 at the @entity112 of @entity7 in @entity113 last week today ’s findings follow last week ’s tv mauling of mr @entity2 by the @entity116 mp mr @entity18			1
the @entity118 leader was lambasted over his failure to tell voters what would happen if @entity6 refused to allow to @entity7 to use the pound after independence			1
following his disastrous tv performance mr @entity2 insisted there was no acceptable ' @entity5 ' if an independent @entity7 is barred from using the @entity127 pound			0
the first minister said dropping the pound ' implies settling for what 's second best ' - but still insisted there will be a deal on a currency union with the rest of the @entity20			2
mr @entity2 has also reiterated his threat to refuse to pay @entity7 's share of the national debt if he is barred from using the pound			2
he said : ' that means taxpayers in the rest of the @entity20 would be lumbered with up to £ 5billion a year in debt interest payments			0
' and @entity7 would start life as an independent country debt - free			0
that 's just one of the many good reasons there will be a currency union			2
' the poll , carried out after the live debate between @entity7 's first minister @entity2 and @entity76 campaign leader @entity18 , shows nearly a quarter of viewers are now more likely to reject independence during tuesday ’s bruising tv debate with mr @entity18 , when mr @entity2 failed to answer questions about his ‘ plan b ’ , the first minister has claimed ‘ it ’s @entity7 ’s pound and we ’re keeping it ’			1
polls following the debate showed that 56 per cent of @entity36 voters want mr @entity2 to draw up a ‘ plan b ’ , with only 35 per cent content for the first minister to remain silent			2
the alternatives are a separate @entity7 currency – either pegged to the pound or with a flexible exchange rate - joining the euro , or using the pound unilaterally in the way that @entity173 and @entity174 use the @entity176 dollar			0
keeping the pound is by far the preferred option for @entity7 , but if a deal is ruled out a separate currency pegged to the pound is the most popular , according to the poll			0
mr @entity2 has gambled his political future on convincing voters that @entity116 , the @entity185 and the @entity186 are bluffing when they said they would rule out a currency union			0
the poll shows that 40 per cent agree with this , and 39 per cent of @entity7 believe they are telling the truth .			0
