it 's been a rollercoaster year for rock band @entity2 since announcing their retirement			1
the @entity6 rockers dealt with major tragedy and then watched it all play out on the small screen miniseries @entity2 : never tear us apart			1
despite the personal challenges , the band has topped the highest - selling album in @entity6 with their greatest hits , @entity14 , which stayed at the @entity16 spot for seven weeks this year after the success of the record - breaking four - hour miniseries			1
the band realised the popular telemovie had quite a hand to play in the resurgence in their popularity , which also sparked a surge in sales , selling more than 280,000 copies			2
' i never guessed we would sell that many to make quadruple platinum and the biggest selling album in @entity6 for the year , which is fantastic and a great honour			1
' one of the reasons band member @entity29 thinks it pushed @entity2 back into the spotlight is because it showed people at home just how much the guys put into their music			1
' the thing i got from it was now all @entity6 know how hard we worked and what we actually achieved			0
i do n't think a lot of @entity6 were really aware of that , ' @entity29 said			0

@entity31 also revealed his wife has been battling breast cancer			0
' i was struggling about whether to say this , but i 'll tell the truth			0
when all that was happening ( the making of the tv miniseries ) my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer , so i was n't really concerned with the past or what it meant , ' he said			0
' i love these guys ... but i was very much in the now			0
so for me , i then replay it as an amazing blessing to have had all those accolades and attention given at the time i was just absolutely smacked with reality from a different area , ' he said			0
his wife is doing better and he says he now feels lucky the band have had this experience			2
' it 's been an interesting year , ' he said			2

' @entity28 was there all the way through it and we 're indebted to @entity28 for that - to relive it again and have the rollercoaster of emotion it must have taken its toll , ' @entity72 said			0
the @entity6 rockers who made it big globally , dealt with major tragedy and then watched it all play out successfully in a four - hour miniseries despite their sudden retirement in 2012 , the band has not ruled out a reunion completely while it was difficult to portray everything perfectly in a four - hour miniseries , the band agrees it captured the essence or the vibe of that time in their life very accurately			1
@entity28 said the actor who played @entity59 , @entity148 , was so like the frontman , that it was almost eerie			2
