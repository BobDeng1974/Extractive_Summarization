by @entity0 published : 04:11 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 26 july 2012 instead of waiting for a service at a local church or temple , worshippers can now pop into a ' pray - o - mat ' and pick up a blessing			1
believers can follow their faiths in a whole new frame of mind by saying their prayers in this ' church ' made from an old photo booth			0
instead of paying £ 5 for a set of four passport snaps , people can now use the touch screen inside the converted booth to listen to up 300 pre-recorded prayers and incantations in 65 different languages			2
scroll down to hear some of the prayers prayers on the go : created by @entity27 artist @entity26 , the specially converted photo booth gives @entity29 's citizens somewhere to pray pick up a prayer : a ' church ' has been installed on the grounds of the @entity29 , home of a large , three - year research project on multi-faith spaces as well as the @entity37 , there are @entity39 and @entity40 benedictions ; aborigine devotional songs , voodoo blessings and solemn chanting of an orthodox @entity45 congregation			1
even @entity46 is catered for , with five minutes of @entity48 prayers included too in the booth			0
users will step into the booth named the ' pray - o - mat ' , scroll through a menu and make the selection on the touch - screen - before donating money in a nearby slot			1
it has opened at the @entity29 in @entity29 as part of a £ 500,000 three year research project into prayer rooms and ' multi faith spaces ' across the world			2
dr @entity63 , senior lecturer in @entity64 at the @entity29 's @entity65 who is leading the project said : ' though the pray - o - mat is a bit tongue - in - cheek , there is a serious message to what we 're doing			1
' successful multi-faith spaces do not need to be flashy or expensive			0
pray - o - mat : the project is described as being ' tongue in cheek ' but has a serious message and will allow people of different faiths to worship in the same place ' in many places a small , clean and largely unadorned space can serve adequately			1
' the conversion of the @entity27 ' @entity85 ' into an @entity87 ' pray - o - mat ' was partly supported by the @entity88 , @entity89 and was funded by the @entity90			1
created by @entity27 artist @entity26 , the booth is free to use and offers prayers via a touch screen - after @entity26 collected them mainly from radio archives including a recording of missionaries singing church songs in 1903			2
the university research team have visited almost 250 multi-faith spaces in the @entity101 and abroad including those at airports , universities , hospitals and shopping malls			0
rearchers say multi faith spaces are presently viewed in @entity101 as ' tangible manifestations of tolerance and pluralism , within a socio - religious landscape characterised by a certain degree of fragmentation			2
' after choosing a blessing , people can then pick up a snack at the vending machine next to the pray - o - mat in the @entity29 they saw charting the emergence and scope of the spaces has been difficult because many are concealed from public view , the team estimate over 1,500 exist in the @entity101			1
they are hoping to investigate the multi faith spaces in terms of architecture , how they might be built and whether they can be places of historical interest			0
researcher dr @entity132 said : ' it is clear that a universal , off - the - shelf space can never adequately serve locally specific purposes			0
' while multi faith spaces - and multi-faith issues in general - have received attention from a theological perspective , less is known around practical themes , such as design , architecture and ornamentation			0
' @entity144 : listen to some of the 300 pre-recorded prayers and incantations ...			0
