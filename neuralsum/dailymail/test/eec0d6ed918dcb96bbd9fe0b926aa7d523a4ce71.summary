@entity0 is a subject you either understand and enjoy or struggle through feeling rather bored			0
but a maths teacher from @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , may have just created the most interesting lesson ever			1
@entity8 , who often posts videos of himself tricking his class on his @entity12 channel , put in a great deal of planning to pull off a lesson that would have engaged even the sleepiest student at the back of the room			2
@entity8 , a teacher at @entity4 in @entity6 , often posts videos of himself tricking his class this amusing clip would have engaged even the sleepiest student at the back of the room acting inconspicuously , mr @entity8 announces to his class that if they have any trouble with some of the things he has gone over in the lesson , they can look up the answers in one of his many helpful videos			1
loading one up on his screen in demonstration , the teacher watches a bit of the video before noticing that the content is backwards and stating that he is embarrassed			2
after acknowledging his supposed blunder again , the recorded version of mr @entity8 on the video screen suddenly halts his virtual lesson to confront the teacher in the classroom			1
the two then begin arguing before the virtual teacher states : ‘ oh , i ’m embarrassing you , well why do n’t you come over here and say that to my face			2
’ pretending to question his sanity , the teacher says : ‘ wait , you ’re just a video , how could i come over ? ’ as the virtual teacher begins telling him off , the real teacher leans out and ' pushes ' the screen back the many pupils in the class can then be heard laughing in astonishment as his virtual counterpart begins pushing the side of the screen and shuffling towards the teacher			1
as the virtual teacher begins telling him off , the real teacher leans out and pushes the screen back to where it was originally			1
the man in the video stumbles as the pupils laugh hysterically at what they are seeing			0
continuing to argue , the pair fight against each other and shove the video box from left to right before the teacher announces that his counterpart needs sorting out			0
he then moves the top part of his body behind the large projection screen and miraculously appears on the screen of the computer			0
the many pupils in the class can then be heard laughing in astonishment during the argument fighting against each other some more , the pair then start throwing the computer ’s icons from the dashboard at each other – one flying past the virtual screen and into the room			0
managing to break free from the box , the virtual teacher turns the tables and ' traps ' the real teacher inside , telling him that he is now stuck inside the video			2
wearing a baseball cap sideways , the rogue teacher closes the video causing the top - half of the real teacher to disappear before heading over to the legs – that dangle from beneath the screen – and attaching himself to them			1
the teacher then re-emerges from behind the screen wearing the baseball cap and the class erupt with laughter			0
the video concludes with the teacher announcing a quiz and the class clapping in admiration .			0
