just 32 per cent of 18 - 24 year olds would consider voting to sever ties with @entity9 in a referendum , compared to 60 per cent of the over- 65s			1
it raises the prospect of the in - out vote promised by @entity14 being fought along generational lines , with those in favour of remaining in the @entity5 relying on getting young people to the ballot box			1
young voters are much less likely to want to leave the @entity5 than the over- 65s , according to the @entity23 poll for @entity4 future the @entity25 have promised to renegotiate @entity4 ’s @entity5 membership , claiming powers back from @entity9 , before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
the new study by the think tank @entity4 future shows young @entity32 are much more pro-european and fear leaving the @entity5 would hit jobs and the economy			0

@entity5 age gap @entity4 future director @entity44 said : ‘ our poll shows that @entity4 people are currently leaning more out than in when it comes to a referendum on @entity50 - but most are a long way from making up their minds and are waiting to see what deal @entity14 can get on the terms of our membership			2
’ it will be a challenge for those who want to stay in the @entity5 , with only younger people in favour of staying in - a group that is less likely to vote than those aged over 65			2
‘ this could make a referendum on @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity5 the first major political event where opinion is divided along generational lines , when we ’ve previously viewed political questions as decided by class , geography or gender			2
’ eight in 10 18 - 24 - year - olds said jobs and the economy would be important when deciding how to vote in a referendum , compared with 62 per cent of over- 65s			1
unsurprisingly just half of pensioners were worried about the loss of the right to work in the @entity5 , compared to 77 per cent of 18 - 24 year - olds			0
