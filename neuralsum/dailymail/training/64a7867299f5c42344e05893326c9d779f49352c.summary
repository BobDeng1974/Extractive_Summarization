by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 13 march 2013 plans for easy - to - understand savings accounts were unveiled by ministers yesterday			2
they want the ' plain vanilla ' products to protect customers from being ripped off , especially by misleading introductory interest rates			1
the products will be backed by an official kitemark to reassure people that a savings account or insurance deal ' does what it says on the tin '			1
ministers want more easy - to - understand savings accounts to be offered by banks the move is a victory for @entity23 's @entity22 campaign , which has called on banks and building societies to end confusion and offer savers simpler , easy - access accounts			1
they will now introduce new and straightforward products including an easy - access savings account , a 30 - day notice savings account , a regular savings account and fixed - term life insurance			1
the savings accounts will not offer bonus or introductory interest rates and all new and old savers will be paid the same rate , regardless of the length of time they hold the product			0
there has been increasing concern about customers being lured in with tantalising initial rates on saving products , not understanding that returns fall to almost nothing later on			1
figures from the @entity51 show £ 1trillion is invested in @entity53 deposit accounts			0
yet , according to the consumer group @entity54 , 40 per cent of this cash is in poorly paying products – some with interest rates as low as 0.1 per cent			1
the onus is on the saver to shop around and switch , allowing banks to make huge profits from those who fail to do so			0
savers with some of banks are told about rates only once every 12 months and are not told when they fall , or when a bonus lapses			0
in many cases , the details are hard to find on the internet			0
the government 's plans will be outlined today following a review by @entity72 , the former chief risk officer at @entity73			1
@entity74 , the economic secretary to the treasury , said : ' people need to be able to manage their everyday finances with confidence and ease			2
' the products outlined in this report represent a milestone towards achieving this , and i am impressed with the way that such a diverse group of organisations has worked together to develop them			2
' the challenge now is to ensure that the work that has gone into the sergeant review is transformed into tangible changes for consumers			0
' miss @entity72 said : ' we have known for a long time that being able to manage your finances effectively leads to increased well - being and a better quality of life , at every given level of income			0
' i hope the simple financial products initiative will make it easier for people to understand and compare the key financial products they need and make good choices with confidence			1
it is now really important to make the recommendations a reality			0
' @entity112 chief executive @entity111 said : ' the development of a suite of simple financial products should help customers to save for a rainy day and to protect themselves against the unexpected			2

products will be backed by an official kitemark to reassure people
move is a victory for @entity23 's @entity125 campaign
