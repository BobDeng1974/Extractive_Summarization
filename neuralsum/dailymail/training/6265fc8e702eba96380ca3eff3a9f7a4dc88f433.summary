by @entity0 published : 22:58 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 28 february 2013 it remains the worst maritime tragedy in @entity4 history , and cost more lives than the @entity6 , but the @entity8 disaster is a story history has largely forgotten			1
in april 1865 , at least 1,700 people , mostly @entity11 soldiers returning home after the end of the @entity14 , lost their lives when the riverboat exploded on the @entity17			1
captain @entity18 had allowed the @entity8 to become dangerously overloaded with passengers - it was carrying six times its capacity of 376 - and the vast majority of helpless victims either suffocated , burned or drowned			1
one of the @entity8 's steam boilers exploded , tearing the vessel in two and sending victims plunging into the icy water the side - wheeler boat had been built for transporting cotton - but had been adapted to carry people and captain @entity30 was encouraged to pick up @entity11 soldiers trying to get home by the offer of $ 5 for each enlisted man and $ 10 for each officer			1
captain @entity30 was encouraged to take on more passengers because the @entity4 government was paying him for each soldier and officer he brought home he left @entity42 with around 100 passengers and headed north but each time he stopped more and more soldiers would get on			0
many had spent months or years in prisoner camps and were desperate to get home			0
at one point the ship had to stay docked for several days while one of steam boilers was repaired which allowed even more passengers to get on			1
when an army officer raised his concerns , captain @entity30 assured him that the @entity8 was more than capable of carrying the load			2
' take good care of those men , ' the officer told him			0
' they are deserving of it			0
' despite being packed in like sardines , the soldiers spirits were high and they were singing songs and telling war stories			0
but after leaving @entity67 , the extra load finally took its toll			0
at around 2am on april 26 , one of the steam boilers exploded quickly followed by the other two			1
the enormous blast split the ship in two firing burning hot coals out like bullets			0
victims were pitched out into the icy water while others suffocated or burned			1
the @entity8 was carrying six times as many passengers than its maximum capacity when it sank in 1865 newspaper reports of the tragedy were relegated to the back pages because of the end of the @entity14 one survivor described it like this : ' the whole heavens seemed to be lighted up by the conflagration			1
hundreds of my comrades were fastened down by the timbers of the decks and had to burn while the water seemed to be one solid mass of human beings struggling with the waves			0
' of an estimated 2,300 people - at least 1,700 lost their lives that night , including captain @entity30			2
but the @entity8 disaster remains a largely unknown part of @entity4 history			2
in the aftermath of such a bloody war , the nation was largely densensitised to death and newspapers were instead full of reports about the end of the war , the new presidency and rebuilding			0
there was also a degree of embarrassment on the part the @entity120 in light of the poor decisions made by officers and the ship 's captain			0
but the bow of the @entity8 remains at the muddy bottom of the @entity17 as a sad memorial to the men who never made it home			1
the story of the @entity8 has been retold in @entity133 's @entity132			2
survivors of the @entity8 described ' the whole heavens being lit up ' during the explosion			2

at least 1,700 died during sinking of riverboat @entity8 in 1865
