young @entity2 fly - half @entity0 scored 22 points to inspire his team to a 43 - 22 win over @entity6 and give them a chance to progress to the @entity10 knock - out stages			1
@entity0 booted five penalties and converted all four of his side 's tries as @entity2 grabbed a crucial bonus point in their battle for qualification			1
prop @entity17 , wing @entity18 , number eight @entity20 and replacement @entity22 went over for the home tries as they replied from three points down at the break to win the second period 27 - 3			1
fly half @entity0 carries forward against @entity6 as his 22 points helped @entity2 to victory @entity32 fly - half @entity30 kept his side in the game during the opening period with four penalties and a conversion of prop @entity39 's try , but could only add one further penalty before the end			1
the key to the win was the @entity2 pack , who were dominant at the set - piece , but their mistakes within kicking distance kept @entity6 in the game during the first period			2
@entity30 took advantage of an early error with a penalty and added a second to keep his side in front after @entity0 had opened the hosts ' account			0
but the powerful pack set the trend and were at the forefront of @entity2 ' opening try when a drive reached the @entity32 line and @entity64 picked up from a ruck , went left around the fringe and found a gap for a converted touchdown			0
@entity2 ' @entity22 scores a try in the corner as @entity71 ( top ) and @entity73 fail to hold him back @entity2 started to stretch out when @entity0 booted his second penalty , but another error saw the clinical exiles fly - half make it a third successful penalty			1
and the @entity78 chipped away at the @entity2 lead again with the half - time whistle approaching and got to within four points as @entity30 struck for a fourth time , this penalty from 38 metres			0
and the visitors ' tenacity paid off as centre @entity73 , who had come close to scoring earlier in the half , nearly got a try , but was hauled down just short			0
yet , from the series of rucks that followed , nobody could stop powerful @entity91 from going over from two metres			0
@entity92 clears the ball from the ruck as the @entity78 fall to @entity2 at @entity95 with @entity30 converting and adding another penalty on the re-start , @entity6 were set fair with a six - point advantage			2
but that was as good as it got for @entity6 , whose hopes of progression are now hanging by a thread			0
@entity2 retook the lead when @entity18 finished off a great move which involved his stand - off in the left corner , with the conversion taking his side a point to the good			2
the home side never lost the lead after that - and did not look likely to either as two more penalties from @entity0 put @entity2 further ahead			2
wasps and @entity32 players line up to observe a two - minute silence on @entity120 @entity6 did not help themselves when replacement prop @entity121 found himself in the sin - bin inside the final quarter of the game			0
and that signalled the end of the @entity32 challenge			0
the home fly - half put his forwards five metres from the @entity78 line and , with them a man down , a driving line - out saw @entity20 easily bundle his way over			1
the bonus point was sealed when @entity2 turned over an @entity32 attack near the home line for a spectacular 80 - metre converted try which was started by @entity0 and finished by flyer @entity22 .			1
