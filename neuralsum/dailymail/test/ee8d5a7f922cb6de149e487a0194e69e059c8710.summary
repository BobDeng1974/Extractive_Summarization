from a man obsessed with looking like @entity3 to a woman who had cement injected into her face , reality tv ’s favorite doctors are back to taking on some of the world ’s most shocking plastic surgeries gone wrong			1
dr @entity9 and dr @entity10 , the resident experts on the popular @entity13 series botched , which is due to begin its second season tonight , spoke to @entity15 about the ' jaw - dropping ' cases they were faced with while filming the upcoming season of the show , explaining that many of the various cosmetic blunders featured go beyond anything either of them had ever been faced with before			1
' these cases are not found in any textbook , ' dr @entity9 said			1
' you ca n't call any surgeon and say , " have you ever seen this ? " because no one has ever seen this			0
during the interview , the duo , who have seen their fair share of cosmetic disasters , also stressed that cosmetic procedures are ' as serious as brain surgery ' - which is one of the reasons why there are so many terrible outcomes			0
dr @entity9 , who said that he and dr @entity10 were ' floored ' by 60per cent of the surgeries they had to fix this season , noted that the show 's producers had to give them time to figure out what they were going to do before they proceeded with a client 's surgery so that they could come up with an effective means of fixing the often horrifying mistakes made by other plastic surgeons			1
he explained that he started this season by putting the cases in the photo section of his cell phone and every morning he would wake up , look at them and ask himself : ' how can i make this possible ? ' he referred to this season as a ' @entity87 ' story because the problems they came across were so impossible to face			0
@entity90 world : @entity92 , who is known as @entity92 , stops by the office to meet with dr @entity9 one of their patients this season , @entity39 , received black market injections from a self - proclaimed ‘ physician ’ who had her face filled with cement at a ' pumping party '			1
dr @entity10 said that @entity39 , who is transgender , underwent the controversial – and incredibly dangerous – procedure ' an underground party where people get injections of black market product '			2
the unknown ' fillers ' can be anything from non-medical grade silicone to food products to even caulking used for the bathtub , and dr @entity10 noted that people performing these risky procedures are not professionals - they are rarely even physicians			2
and the results are often disastrous			0
' once you have something put in your body , you 're screwed , ' she said			0
' i obviously do n't want to use that word , " you 're screwed , " but you 're permanently ruined			0
' reality star : @entity125 @entity124 ( pictured ) has spent more than $ 100,000 on plastic surgery to make him look more like his idol @entity3 dr @entity10 added : ' you ca n't reverse it most of the time			1
people say , " oh , it 's no big deal , go get some fillers ! " wrong			0
' other times the outcomes can even be deadly			0
' the chances that it could go south , that you could have a complication is real and it 's more than one per cent , ' he said			0
the doctors also acknowledged that there is a ' circus act component ' to the show , particularly when they are dealing with patients who are obsessed with looking like human dolls or their favorite celebrities , including @entity125 @entity124 , who has spent thousands to look like @entity3			2
while they do n't want to help people become ' famous internet freaks ' , dr @entity9 explained that it is important for them to fix the patient 's surgical problem because ' they still deserve the right to be back in society normally '			1
costly obsession : this woman says she has had 300 cosmetic procedures seeking perfection : this man said his nose has been ' chopped up more than ahi tuna ' before he visited the show 's doctors and giving people that opportunity is a part of what makes the show so rewarding			0
according to dr @entity9 , the patients featured on the series have often been ' turned down by every good plastic surgeon in the nation ' , so he and dr @entity10 are often their ' last hope '			1
they even had patient this season who went homeless because of trying to correct a botched surgery			2
' if we do n't use our experience , our education , our training on them , some numbskull with no experience and no education or training is going to try and it 's going to get worse , ' he said			0
on tonight 's premiere of the show , the doctors are trying to help former reality star @entity195 ' @entity198 ' @entity197 from @entity200 series @entity201 fix her sagging breasts			1
the doctors will also treat former baywatch star @entity204 and musician @entity205 from @entity206 , among others , this season			2
