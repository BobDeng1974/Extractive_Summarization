@entity1 , a financial expert who was instrumental in saving the foundering @entity14 project in the @entity15 , now intends to have the ban ruled illegal at the @entity17			1
the 56 - year - old was furious to be told by email that he will never be allowed back on a @entity0 train unless he proves he can be ‘ courteous and polite ’			2
last night the father of four described the ban as ‘ ridiculous , repugnant and ‘ draconian ’ after trying to buy another ticket and having it cancelled			0
the row began when he was returning with a colleague to @entity27 on september 6 after a conference in @entity29			0
in the buffet car he ordered two teas at £ 2.20 each – and asked for an extra bag so he could have a strong cuppa			1
however , when he was charged £ 2.20 just for the third tea bag , he complained			1
staff refused to back down and after a heated row he left the untouched teas and extra @entity39 tea bag on the counter and walked off mouthing the words ‘ idiotic bitches ’			1
but the buffet car staff said they felt threatened and the train made an unscheduled stop at @entity47 in @entity48 where mr @entity1 was bundled off by police , accused of trying to steal a tea bag			1
mr @entity1 , of @entity51 , south - east @entity52 , only found out he had been banned for life after buying a single to @entity55 to pick up his car from a house he owns in northern @entity58 on december 3			1
two days before travelling , he received an email from @entity0 telling him the ticket had been cancelled and he was banned			2
after calling @entity61 , @entity0 ’s service and people director , mr @entity1 emailed him to claim he was being punished for complaining about service			1
an hour later , he received a reply stating : ‘ we have decided you should not be permitted to travel on @entity0 services			2
any other booking made by you will be cancelled			0
the above decision is final			0

last night he said : ‘ i am being blackmailed into making an apology and dropping my case			0
they are just bullies , abusing their monopoly and using brute force to require me to drop my claims			0
and despite all this they have n’t even changed their policy on their tea			0
’ ironically , mr @entity1 helped to keep the @entity14 dream alive when it looked as if it might fail			1
in 1993 , when he worked at the bank @entity101 , the @entity100 called him in to advise on the project as costs spiralled			0
he and his team managed to get extra bank funding to keep it on track			0
last night , mr @entity1 , who part owns the tea firm @entity107 , said : ‘ when i have a builder ’s tea i like a proper stand - up job			1
‘ in every other situation where i have asked for an extra bag everyone has agreed – apart from @entity0			1
anyone who believes in the rule of law will see this is repugnant			0
