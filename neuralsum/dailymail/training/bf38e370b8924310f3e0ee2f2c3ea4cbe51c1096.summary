@entity1 ’s banker foursomes pairing of @entity2 and @entity3 had already trampled on @entity5 opposition before the start of the @entity7 at @entity8 on friday morning			1
the @entity10 duo have designed their first course together at @entity14 ’s @entity13 , just across the border from @entity16 , which has 12 courses			1
the new @entity19 course , which opens next month , is set up for matchplay			2
it is a complete re-design of the previously named @entity23 course , which has been consigned to the deep rough			1
foursomes pait @entity2 and @entity3 during thursday 's practice at @entity8 @entity27 name the courses after their famous golfing designers , such as @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
but it was felt that former world @entity37 , a @entity7 player in 1999 and 2001 , had fallen too far off the golfing map			0
his design was n’t considered a good one , either			0
@entity40 and @entity2 will officially open their course on october 28 with a singles matchplay			1
the winner is to receive a luxury flat on the @entity47 complex			0
@entity2 and @entity3 were in good spirits ahead of the start of the @entity7 all week in the captains ’ press conferences , @entity1 ’s @entity52 has come across as the more assured leader			1
but after the pairings were announced on thursday , it was noticeable the @entity5 ’s @entity56 suddenly looked the more confident			1
@entity5 team captain @entity56 speaks during the opening ceremony the chances of traffic meltdown around @entity8 this morning , with 45,000 spectators arriving in the dark to be there for that iconic first tee shot at 7.35am , are more likely than an @entity2 fist pump , such has been the shambolic transport planning			1
it reached the ludicrous situation on thursday of the driver of a media bus adding to an already lengthy one - and - a - half hour journey from @entity71 by stopping in a @entity73 car park for a 30 - minute rest because he had exceeded his designated hours			2
@entity76 , who run @entity7 travel services , pass the buck and said they were only one of a number of agencies involved in the transport blueprint and they had sub-contracted the botched bus service			0
@entity85 media transport driver has to stop near @entity86 in a @entity73 car park for a half hour break the merchandising tent at @entity8 is doing better business than the one at @entity91 in 2010 , although it is nowhere near as big as the @entity94 operation , which made more than £ 10m in three days of frenzied trading			1
this follows retail specialists @entity98 taking over the running from marketing agents @entity101 after a tender			0
@entity104 ’s online business has also seen 5,000 commemorative @entity7 £ 5 notes sold for £ 20 each			2
stars sidelined at gig the music at the @entity7 gala concert in @entity71 was considered top drawer but those who went to the event principally to see the golfers introduced to the crowd would have felt very short - changed			2
there was only 20 minutes allocated for the players in the @entity118 proceedings and they were rushed through the ceremony , with only brief words from the two captains			0
dull @entity123 radio presenter @entity122 , who had great trouble recognising who was who , announced one competitor and partner just as another couple was walking on to the stage			0
@entity1 congratulate singer @entity131 for her performance in the opening ceremony this diluted the marvellous reception given to both sides , with not a moment allowed to soak up the special applause , especially loud for @entity56 and local boy @entity139			1
even the @entity141 team , who had complained about the length of their stay at the concert in @entity146 , felt they should have been on stage longer to make it more of an occasion			0
@entity151 ’s barb about @entity152 and @entity153 ‘ litigating ’ against each other has not affected the harmony within @entity1			2
but there has been some discord behind the scenes with @entity123 ’s @entity159 , who played in 2012 , very upset he was n’t picked as a vice-captain when the event is being staged on his home soil			0
@entity52 preferred @entity164 ’s @entity163 and @entity34			0
however , @entity159 did tweet during the opening ceremony : ‘ fantastic speech from captain @entity52 , well done			2
’ northern irishmen @entity153 ( left ) and @entity168 ( right ) wait to tee off on wednesday @entity169 a marked man			0

@entity1 pair @entity2 and @entity3 have designed a course in @entity14 together - a *redesign* of the @entity23 course
@entity5 captain @entity56 has grown in confidence throughout the week
traffic chaos expected at @entity8 ahead of friday morning start
@entity8 merchandising tent is doing better business than the one at @entity91 in 2010
