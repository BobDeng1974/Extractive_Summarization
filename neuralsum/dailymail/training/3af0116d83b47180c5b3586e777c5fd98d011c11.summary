by @entity0 parents are furious after seven girls were sent home from their secondary school in disgrace - due to their knee - length skirts being worn ' too short '			1
the youngsters were confronted by teachers who claimed the skirts would ' ride up ' while they were walking , sitting or climbing stairs			1
one girl said a staff member asked to check the waistband on her skirt to see if it was rolled up			1
two others went back to the 1,424 pupil @entity15 in @entity17 , @entity18 , with what they believed was the correct length of skirt - but were sent home again because it was deemed to be the ' wrong ' material			1
the pair missed up to three days of lessons due to the row			1
skirting the issue : ( left to right ) @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , who were sent home about the length of their skirts			1
@entity30 and @entity31 later returned but were then told their garments were the ' wrong material ' today the mothers of @entity31 and @entity39 , both 12 , voiced their disgust at the school			1
pub landlady @entity42 , 40 , said : ' i 'm absolutely disgusted that @entity31 has had to be off school for three days over this			2
it 's just so petty and a really bad way of dealing with the issue			1
' as far as i 'm concerned the skirt is the required length but they say it rides up when she was walks or goes up the stairs - but all clothes can do that in those circumstances			1
' whatever you 're wearing your trousers or jeans or skirts will ride up when you sit down or move - you ca n't help that			1
that 's no reason to make a girl miss three days of school			2
' @entity31 has tried other skirts but they are too long and too big			0
sending them home is not right			1
surely a detention or a warning would be more appropriate			0
' the row erupted earlier this month after the girls arrived at school for monday classes			1
teachers believed their knee length skirts were too high and did not conform to its rules of ' a smart , distinctive and mature appearance '			1
anger : left , @entity42 with daughter @entity31			0
the mother said : ' it 's just so petty and a really bad way of dealing with the issue '			1
@entity84 , @entity85 and daughter @entity30 @entity30 and @entity31 went back the next day but were sent home again after staff questioned the skirt 's material			1
by wednesday their parents went to the school themselves to resolve the row			1
@entity30 was allowed back to class after she promised to keep pulling her skirt down to the right length , but mrs @entity31 failed to reach an agreement on @entity31 's uniform and the youngster missed another day of school			1
when she was finally allowed to return after missing three days on thursday june 12 she was put on school report - meaning teachers had to record a comment on her skirt every lesson			2
the year 8 pupils , both of @entity17 , are now so upset over the affair that their parents are considering transferring them to different schools			1
@entity30 's mother @entity85 , 41 , a bookkeeper , said : ' it 's ludicrous			2
the girls have basically been sent home for simply following the rules			1
the skirts are quite clearly knee - length - i do n't know who says which part of the knee it has to be			2
@entity15 in @entity17 , @entity18 , has defended its uniform policy ' the school policy states knee - length black skirt and that 's what this is			1
the policy has always been there and there 's never been a problem until now			0
' the punishment does n't fit the crime			0
the girls have missed out on vital learning			2
' people are saying we should follow the rules for our daughters but we are ... it 's atrocious the school will go to such lengths over a skirt not to mention the time it took me to actually speak to someone about it			2
' @entity31 and @entity30 are both good kids			0
@entity30 had an outstanding school report yet the staff seem happy to put them through all this and allow them to miss days			0
row : @entity152 with daughters @entity29 and @entity154 ' there 's also no consistency either as @entity30 said some of the teachers told her , her skirt was fine and there are other kids with skirts even shorter			1
' ' if they 're going to be pedantic , they need clear and concise rules on uniform			0
saying its the wrong material makes them look undignified			2
' @entity31 said : ' i have n't done anything wrong			0
the staircases are open so teachers are saying people can look up your @entity175 i did n't do any of this on purpose			0
' according to the school 's website girls must wear a white blouse , black trousers or knee - length skirt , ' sturdy ' black school shoes , tights and black or grey socks			1
it adds : ' our uniform tries to combine a smart , distinctive and mature appearance with value for money			0
it is important to us that our students have a reputation for looking good and behaving well , both on and off our premises and we believe that our uniform helps us in that aim			0
' findings from the school 's most recent @entity200 inspection in march last year ruled that @entity15 still required improvement after an inspection in january which found gcse scores were ' generally below average '			0
parents have taken to social media to criticise the school 's decision on their skirt - length policy			1
one said : ' it 's a shame the schools do n't pay the same attention and passion to bullying and truancy , etc instead of focusing and punishing silly little things like this , sort out the big issues			0
' @entity222 added : ' they did exactly the same with our daughter			0
i went into school and they had me waiting two and half hrs before anybody would see me			0
' i 'm appalled at what they are doing they need to deal with the issues that are serious in that school not the petty skirt situation			1
they have more important things to sort out			0
' @entity15 's community director @entity238 said school policy was for either parents to bring alternative uniform into school or pupils would be sent home			2
she added : ' all parents and students are aware of the @entity15 's uniform policy			0
' it is the responsibility of parents to send their children to school appropriately dressed			0
students and parents are given an opportunity to resolve issues with uniform should they arise			0
' last week the headteacher of a secondary school where more than 250 girls were taken out of lessons because their skirts were too short defended the ‘ uniform crackdown ’			2
dr @entity263 , headteacher at @entity264 on the @entity265 , said the school ’s uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness in a letter sent to parents			0
he said : ‘ we are preparing students for the world of work so it is important that we teach students about the importance of managing their appearance and working to a dress code			0
' we have a number of female students who have recently said that they are coming under peer pressure to wear their skirts shorter than they feel comfortable			0
‘ it is not fair that girls should be made to feel uncomfortable when they are just following the uniform policy			2
' many parents , however , were angry about the clampdown			0
@entity289 , from @entity290 , @entity265 , said her 14 - year - old daughter @entity291 had been sent home twice on the same day , for having a skirt that was too short and then trousers that were too tight			1
the 39 - year - old mother - of - two said : ‘ it was an absolute joke			2
it has been a nightmare			0
‘ i just ca n’t understand why the school have decided to do it five weeks before the end of the year			0
