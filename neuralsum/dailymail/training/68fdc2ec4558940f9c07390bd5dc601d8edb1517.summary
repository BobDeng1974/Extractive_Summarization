‘ there is currently no cure for kidney diseases , so early detection is vital to provide any chance of halting , preventing or reversing the damage to the kidney caused by the disease			2
‘ however , the signs are often difficult to spot which is why the disease is often referred to as the “ silent killer ” and many patients go undiagnosed until their kidneys completely fail			0
