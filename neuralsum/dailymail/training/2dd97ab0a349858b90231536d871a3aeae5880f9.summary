three gp practices in @entity1 have been put into special measures after health inspectors deemed they are providing sub-standard care to patients			1
the step is significant marking the first time gp surgeries have ever been subjected to the move by the @entity9			0
the independent health and social care regulator said : ' it is the first time , and it is significant			0
' the special measures , which come with help and support from officials , are a six - month warning for improvements to be made			2
if steps are not taken to improve care to patients at the surgeries in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , the @entity9 has the power to review the practice 's registration , or ultimately , call for the practice to be shut down			1
three gp practices have been placed in special measures by the @entity9			1
it is significant as they are the first gp surgeries ever to be subjected to the measure			0
@entity35 and @entity36 , right , run by dr @entity37 , left , is one of the three currently receiving extra help to improve professor @entity40 , the @entity9 's senior national gp adviser , said : patients should be able to expect high quality and consistent care from every gp practice			1
' where we have required improvement , we will expect the practice to take the necessary steps to address the issue , and we will return at a later date to check that those improvements have been made			0
' three of the five practices , which have been rated inadequate have been placed into special measures and have been offered a package of support by @entity1 to help them improve			1
' the other two practices have been told they will be put into special measures if they fail to improve			1
' the first of the three practices placed into special measures are @entity35 and @entity36 run by dr @entity37 in @entity63 , @entity22			1
inspectors rated the surgery inadequate for being safe , effective , caring , responsive and well - led			1
the second , @entity67 run by dr @entity68 in @entity23 , @entity69 , was rated inadequate for being safe and well - led			1
the surgery was seen as being good at caring for patients but needs improvement to be considered responsive and effective			0
meanwhile @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , was the third , also rated as inadequate for being safe , effective and well - led			1
the @entity9 said it also needs improvement to be considered caring and responsive			0
two other practices have been warned they will be placed in special measures if they fail to improve			1
three gp surgeries in @entity1 have been placed into special measures after @entity9 inspectors deemed the service they provide inadequate			1
they are : two more practices have been rated inadequate and warned if they fail to improve they will be placed into special measures			1
they are : they were named as those surgeries run by dr @entity90 , @entity91 in @entity92 , and the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95			2
the @entity92 practice is inadequate for being safe , effective , responsive and well - led and needs improvement to be caring while the @entity98 was deemed as inadequate for being safe and well - led			1
it was rated as good at being caring , responsive and effective			0
patients registered with any of the practices put into special measures were told not to worry			2
help is being provided by @entity1 and the @entity104 of @entity105 ( @entity106 ) and aims to ensure there are no immediate risks to patient safety			0
@entity1 @entity1 's deputy medical director dr @entity110 said : ' general practice is the bedrock of the @entity1 and it 's pleasing that the majority of practices inspected are rated good , with some rated outstanding			1
' these inspections are about ensuring that every patient , anywhere across the country , receives consistently high quality services by identifying issues so improvements can be made			0
' and for those in special measures that need extra support , we are working with the @entity105 , @entity123 and @entity124 ( @entity125 ) to help turn the affected practices around , including the offer of additional support from the @entity106			2
' the @entity9 began inspecting the 8,500 gp practices in @entity1 last october			2
they are all judged on five categories - according to whether they are safe , caring , effective , responsive and well - led - and rated as outstanding , good , requiring improvement or inadequate			1
of the 143 it has rated so far , six have been outstanding , 112 have been good , 20 have been judged to require improvement and five , including the three now in special measures , have been ruled ' inadequate '			2
the @entity140 ( @entity141 ) directors , who manage the @entity72 , accepted that they ' still need to put further work into improving the running and organisation ' of the practice			0
they wanted ' to reassure patients that patient care remains our top priority ' and they would be ' redoubling our efforts ' to improve under the watchful eye of @entity1 ( @entity154 ) , the @entity155 and @entity156 and the @entity106 ( @entity106 )			0
five practices in total have been found to be inadequate since @entity9 inspectors began the process of rating each of the 8,500 gp practices in @entity1			1
so far 143 have been inspected ( file picture ) in a statement they said : ' we know that continuity of care is important to our patients and that improvements to our processes will help improve the running of the practice , so we ask that patients please continue to support us and please speak to us about any concerns they may have			0
' the @entity141 directors said they had taken over a practice with many challenges but counted patients being seen on the same day if needed , introducing legionella testing and reviewing infection control processes along with increasing the number of gp sessions available among the signs that it has made progress			0
@entity186 , which provides support and advice to primary care in @entity69 , said of dr @entity68 's surgery : ' patients can be assured that the @entity125 is working with relevant agencies , including @entity1 , to support the practice during the next six months and will ensure that the population of @entity23 receives locally delivered gp services which meet the required standard			1
' in the meantime , patients of @entity67 can , during the period of special measures continue to receive their care at @entity67 in the same way			0
' a spokeswoman for dr @entity37 said they did not want to comment			2
the @entity207 ( @entity207 ) raised concerns at the @entity9 naming and shaming the five practices			0
chairman dr @entity210 , said : ' it is encouraging that the vast majority of inspection reports returned good or outstanding ratings for gp practices			2
' this does demonstrate that gp practices across the country are delivering high quality , responsive care to their patients despite the incredible workload and funding pressures that @entity98 services are facing			2
' however , we remain concerned at the way the @entity9 continues to name and shame in public the small number of practices that the @entity9 deems to be having problems			0
' while any issues with patient care must be immediately resolved , it is not helpful that the @entity9 continues to pursue an inspection regime that is flawed in many aspects			0
' for example , it is absurd that judgments are being made before physical inspections take place on a number of questionable indicators such as how many internal meetings a practice holds			0
' we really must strive for a more robust and fair approach that maintains patient care while at the same time supporting and helping those practices that are struggling			0

first time the @entity9 has ever placed @entity251 into special measures
all gp practices are being inspected to check they are safe , effective , caring , responsive and well - led
dr @entity37 in @entity22 , a practice offered by dr @entity68 in @entity23 and @entity258 in @entity73 are receiving help
if they do not improve in six months , @entity9 can review their registration
two other practices - in @entity92 and @entity95 - were rated inadequate and warned they will be put in special measures if they fail to improve
