by @entity0 the terrifying power of sharks has been revealed in a stunning video where a great white attacks a robotic vehicle			1
the @entity6 was deployed off @entity8 ’s @entity7 to film the predators in the wild			1
but the researchers had n’t banked on a shark feeling threatened by an intruder in its territory - and were stunned when on - board cameras recorded a formidable encounter			1
a robotic vehicle off @entity8 's @entity18 has been attacked by a shark ( shown )			1
the dramatic footage was captured by six cameras on the @entity22 the robotic vehicle was being operated by a research team from the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
a surge in shark attacks around the @entity28 of @entity29 has n’t stopped surfers getting into the water			2
instead , locals are placing their trust in technologies that claim to keep the predators away by sending an electric pulse through the water			2
one particular device , known as the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , has enjoyed massive popularity on the island			0
‘ they just can not make these things fast enough , ’ said @entity42 and @entity44 owner @entity43 , who keeps a waiting list for the products and sells out as soon as he 's restocked			0
users strap the devices to their ankles , wetsuits or surfboards			0
some are about the size of an oversized watch , others the size of a wallet			0
they range in price from £ 249 ( $ 399 ) to £ 390 ( $ 649 )			0
the cylinder - shaped vehicle has six cameras facing in all directions to provide a panoramic view of its environment			2
it uses special acoustic tags to follow objects or animals in its vicinity			0
‘ but the hunter soon became the hunted , ’ the video explains			0
@entity6 was approached by a great white shark , which soon swam into it at high speed and began biting the vehicle			1
during its attempt to eat the vehicle the shark closes a flap of skin over its eye known as the nictitating membrane to prevent any damage from flailing prey			1
once it realises the vehicle is n’t food , however , it then merely considers it a threat			2
in the video ( shown ) the shark tried to eat the robotic vehicle like it is a seal when the shark realises the vehicle is not food it begins to attack it and mark its territory			1
the video could help reveal how sharks hunt in the water it begins swimming past and ramming the vehicle , showing clear signs of a creature exhibiting territorial behaviour			1
it lurks in the darkness before swimming up and attacking			0
the researchers were surprised when the vehicle was pulled back out of the water only to find teeth marks all over it			0
as one expert explains in the video , causing such damage would have required a great force			0
‘ if you banged on it with a screwdriver you would n’t get the same amount of damage ’ he said			0
it ’s hoped the footage will help reveal details about shark strategies in hunting and interacting			2
the shark lurks in the darkness before springing its attack upon the robotic vehicle six cameras on board @entity6 film a panorama of its environment , with the shark shown in the front - right here an expert explains how the teeth marks they found would be hard to replicate with a screwdriver			1
