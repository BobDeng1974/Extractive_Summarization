by @entity0 published : 17:38 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 17:38 est , 9 september 2013 only five consultants work in @entity3 overnight across the entire country , it can be revealed today			1
emergency departments are being left in the hands of junior doctors between midnight and eight in the morning			1
and they are being overseen by only a handful of slightly more experienced medics – many of whom are locums			0
midnight terror : once the clock strikes 12am , there are only five senior consultants in all of @entity19 , leaving junior doctors in charge figures obtained by the @entity23 show that just five @entity25 trusts in @entity19 employ a consultant to work in @entity3 overnight – even though thousands of seriously ill and injured patients turn up during these hours			1
although most of the other hospitals have an ‘ on - call ’ consultant who can be contacted after they have gone home , junior staff are often reluctant to trouble them			1
even during the day , 90 per cent of trusts have only one consultant working in @entity3 at weekends			1
the number of patients turning up in @entity3 has soared by 50 per cent in a decade and many hospitals are struggling to cope with the surge in demand			2
today health secretary @entity40 will announce a range of plans – including £ 500million of extra funding – to help casualty departments avoid a crisis this winter when it is feared the numbers of patients will increase further			0
hope for help from @entity40 : secretary of state for health @entity40 is set to announce £ 500million of extra funding to @entity3 departments to get them through the winter these are likely to include making a named gp responsible for every older person so fewer end up in @entity3 in the first place			0
he also wants to free family doctors from paperwork so they have more time to see patients – particularly out - of hours when many go to casualty instead			0
but it is unclear how the measures will be able to force consultants to work overnight			0
opinion polls show the public expects the most experienced hospital doctors to work their share of anti-social hours			0
not all patients who arrive in @entity3 need to see a consultant and they can be managed by junior doctors or nurses			1
however , consultants play a vital role in @entity3 where crucial life - or - death decisions about the most seriously ill patients need to be made very quickly			1
the @entity23 used the @entity80 to ask all @entity25 hospitals how many consultants worked in @entity3 overnight and at the weekend			1
around two thirds of some 160 hospital trusts in @entity19 have @entity3 departments			2
just five of the 92 trusts which replied employed one consultant overnight – @entity88 and @entity89 , @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 of @entity93 , @entity94 and the @entity95			2
at the remaining 87 @entity25 trusts , the last consultant goes home at either 8pm , 10pm or midnight			1
the figures also showed that more than half of trusts only employ one ‘ middle grade ’ doctor overnight , who will generally have two and six years ’ experience			2
increasing numbers : 21.7million people were admitted to @entity3 last year , a 50 per cent rise in ten years these will be tied - up with the most critical patients , leaving junior doctors to deal with everyone else			1
and 90 per cent of trusts said there was just one consultant working at the @entity3 department during the day on saturdays and sundays			1
statistics show that patients are 10 per cent more likely to die if they are brought to hospital at weekends compared to during the week			0
@entity120 of the @entity121 , a charity , said : ‘ patients are increasingly resorting to @entity3 because they can not get an appointment with their gp			0
when they use @entity3 they expect to see the most competent staff who are in a position to make the correct diagnosis			0
‘ the care that is provided outside normal working hours must be of the same standard – for too long we have put up with this nine to five mentality within the @entity25			0
’ @entity134 of charity @entity133 said : ‘ you need top quality doctors in @entity3 more than anywhere else as here – by definition – is where the emergencies come in			2
’ @entity141 mp , @entity142 ’s health spokesman said : ‘ these figures reveal the full - blown staffing crisis at all levels of @entity19 ’s a&es			0
there can be no case for ministers not investigating these findings			0
’ the @entity23 ’s figures also reveal that some units are so understaffed that more than half of the consultant posts are currently vacant			0
many doctors do not want to work in @entity3 because it is regarded as stressful and the hours are longer than those in other departments			2
a spokesman for @entity40 said : ‘ we know senior consultants ’ presence in @entity3 makes a big difference to patients			1
that ’s why a large portion of this year ’s winter funding ( the £ 500million ) will go to help pay for extended consultant hours in @entity3			2

just five @entity25 trusts employ senior consultants for @entity3 overnight
units are instead left in the hands of junior doctors between 12am - *8am*
nine in then trusts only have one senior @entity3 consultant at weekends
