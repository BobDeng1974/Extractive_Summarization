for fans of the cult film the @entity3 , it is a familiar pose			0
however , in the latest video from the @entity8 military team developing a two legged fighting robot , the buildup to ' crane kick ' is seen in a new way			1
the researchers taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process			2
' @entity18 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			2
' in extremely challenging terrain , @entity18 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			2
' the @entity18 robot created by @entity31 - owned firm @entity20 is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb			1
the robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision , and is one of the most advanced robots ever created			0
however , it 's not just karate - @entity39 has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the @entity42 which allows him to drive a car			1
' to achieve this level of maneuverability in robots , researchers at @entity47 look toward nature , ' the team say			0
' inspired by the speed of cheetahs , the endurance of horses , the maneuverability of monkeys , and the versatility of humans , @entity47 researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast , efficient , and graceful , with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can			0
' at the @entity66 's @entity65 , @entity39 came second , despite competing as a virtual software simulation			2
despite his lack of limbs , the world 's most innocuously named ' bot was able to walk , carry a fire hose and , most impressively , get in a car and drive it			0
the ' crane ' stance , being held by @entity3 @entity77 ( played by @entity78 left ) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the @entity18 robot			1
it demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the @entity31 - owned machine , said the firm @entity18 is a high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain , @entity20 said			1
' @entity18 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			2
in extremely challenging terrain , @entity18 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			0
the researchers taught the robot the trick to show off its balance			0
the @entity18 robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can ' see ' where it is going			1
' articulated , sensate hands will enable @entity18 to use tools designed for human use			0
@entity18 includes 28 hydraulically - actuated degrees of freedom , two hands , arms , legs , feet and a torso			1
' an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder			0
' @entity18 is powered from an off - board , electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this .			1
