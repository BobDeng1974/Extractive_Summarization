an awful 146 - word term paper littered with grammatical errors that is barely even readable has become a potent visual symbol of the @entity4 's fake classes scandal			1
the one - paragraph essay on civil rights icon @entity6 earned an a- and was exposed by former @entity4 professor @entity9 , who spent 10 years teaching @entity4 's athletes before she turned whistleblower on alleged classroom corruption			1
the shocking essay came to light during an @entity16 documentary timed to coincide with the @entity18 basketball competition			0
it contains allegations that @entity4 athletes in danger of failing were encouraged to sign up for fake tutor groups designed to let students pass			1
scroll down for a video : allegations of academic fraud : this is @entity9 a former student adviser at @entity4 who has claimed that many athletic students at the college were unable to read or write and that fake classes were set up to enable them to play and to graduate the so - called ' paper classes ' were essentially no - show study groups that allowed semi-literate and in some cases , illiterate athletes to pass , thereby boosting their @entity38 to meet the @entity40 's eligibility requirements			1
the anonymous essay , titled , ' @entity6 : my story ' attempts to recount the important moment on december 1 , 1955 in @entity45 , @entity46 , when @entity6 refused to give her seat up for a white man			1
however , it fails to even place the event in the past or give any gravitas to the momentous moment in @entity54 history			0
' some of these college students could read at a second or third grade level , ' @entity9 , a @entity4 academic adviser since 2003 told @entity16			1
' students were taking classes that really did n't exist			2
they were called independent studies at that time and they just had to write a paper ... there was no attendance			0
' during the course of her @entity16 interview , @entity63 confirmed the existence of ' easy paper classes ' and alleged that students were guided to these classes by their academic advisors			1
' their job is n't necessarily to make @entity74 a better person , a smarter person , ' @entity63 told @entity16			0
' their job is to make sure i 'm eligible to play			0
' @entity74 , played football at @entity4 from 2007 to 2010 and has admitted to the scam , now says he is ashamed to have been involved with it			1
@entity9 's whistleblowing began in 2011 after she became appalled that @entity4 , rather than educating its athletes was keeping them from needing to study at all			1
the paper : this is the essay on @entity6 that received an a- that @entity9 produced as evidence of apparent academic fraud on an @entity16 special timed to coincide with @entity18 she began to release information to journalists about basketball and football stars who read at a grade school level			1
she confessed herself to steering many young men into lecture classes that simply did not exist			0
and most galling for her , given @entity4 's proud history pushing for desegregation , that the courses were in african - american history			1
@entity9 began to feed information about alleged academic fraud to the @entity103 in @entity104			1
@entity4 is heavily invested in the $ 16 billion business that is college sports but @entity9 's revelations threaten that			1
' i was part of something that i came to be ashamed of , ' said @entity9 to @entity112 in february			1
on the evening of december @entity6 decided that she was going to sit in the white people section on the bus in @entity45 , @entity46			2
during this time blacks had to give up there seats to whites when more whites got on the bus			0
@entity6 refused to give up her seat			2
her and the bus driver began to talk and the conversation went like this			0
' let me have those front seats ' said the driver			0
she did n’t get up and told the driver that she was tired of giving her seat to white people			0
' i ’m going to have you arrested , ' said the driver			0
' you may do that , ' @entity6 responded			2
two white policemen came in and @entity6 asked them ' why do you all push us around ? ' the police officer replied and said ' i do n’t know , but the law is the law and you ’re under arrest			2
' we were n’t serving the kids			0
we were n’t educating them properly			0
we were pushing them toward graduation , and that ’s not the same as giving them an education			0
' when she publicly came forward , @entity4 stripped of her supervisory title and denied the allegations of widespread academic fraud			1
@entity4 officials noted in a statement released after the @entity16 report aired that little new information was revealed and noted that the university has used the episode as a chance to improve			1
' we have instituted numerous reforms , including new governance and accountability standards in our @entity161 , ' vice chancellor for communications and public affairs @entity155 said in the statement			0
in january senior @entity4 officials publicly condemned her for suggesting that football and basketball stars could n’t read well enough to get through college classes honestly			1
the fake classes were investigated in 2012 and department head @entity170 was listed as the instructor for the classes , although he calender revealed him to be abroad during some of these			1
he has been charged with a felony for defrauding the university , and is currently fighting the charge in court			0
indeed , @entity4 has been in an academic crisis mode for more than three years			1
shocking : @entity9 said her research of 183 football or basketball players at @entity4 from 2004 - 12 found 60 percent reading at fourth - to eighth - grade levels and roughly 10 percent below a third - grade level			1
an @entity40 investigation into the football program in 2010 expanded into a probe of how the nation 's first public university provides academic help to athletes			1
it led to a discovery of fraud in a department with classes featuring significant athlete enrollments			2
now , the debate of balancing academics and big - time sports at the university has been reignited by comments from a reading specialist about the reading levels of football and basketball players			0
' it really has just been like we 've been under siege for the past three years , ' said @entity211 , a banking law professor and @entity4 's faculty athletic representative in january			1
' now to the extent that we 've uncovered problems during this siege , that 's a good thing — to find those problems and weed them out and to try to put processes in place to hopefully ensure ... that some of this stuff does n't happen again			0
' in a @entity223 story that aired in january , @entity9 said her research of 183 football or basketball players at @entity4 from 2004 - 12 found 60 percent reading at fourth - to eighth - grade levels and roughly 10 percent below a third - grade level			1
she said she worked with one men 's basketball player early in her 10 - year tenure who could n't read or write			0
' i do n't believe it 's true , ' @entity4 coach @entity231 said in january			2
' it 's totally unfair			0
i 'm really proud of the kids we 've brought in here			0
... we have n't brought anybody in like that			0
we 've had one senior since i 've been here that did not graduate			0
allegations : @entity9 said she worked with one men 's basketball player early in her 10 - year tenure who could n't read or write ( her allegations did not relate to @entity74 - who is pictured here in a game gainst the @entity249 in 2009 ) ' anybody can make any statement they want to make but that is not fair			1
the @entity4 does n't do that			2
the @entity4 does n't stand for that			2
' @entity9 has said in interviews that she has received death threats and hate mail			1
@entity4 police spokesman @entity259 said investigators have contacted her and ' are responding appropriately			2
' @entity211 said @entity9 had shared her findings previously but has n't provided data that led to her conclusions			2
' if @entity9 's data uncovers issues that would be helpful to us in our admissions process or in our academic support process , then i want to know about those so we can benefit from whatever work she has done ... in moving forward and doing things better , ' @entity211 said			1
admissions director @entity274 , a review group member , said his office wo n't hesitate to tell coaches no if a recruit ca n't handle coursework			0
' we do not rubber - stamp anyone for admission , ' @entity279 said			0
' we evaluate students for admission and we decide whether the students are capable of succeeding academically at @entity4			2
that 's about as plain as i can make it			0
' the topic of balancing academics and athletics is n't unique to @entity4 , such as the @entity290 reporting in 2011 that 39 schools had at least 50 percent of football players clustering in one , two or three majors			2
but the scope of problems here has often left officials sifting through what happened as much as looking ahead			0
in december , a grand jury indicted @entity300 for receiving $ 12,000 to teach one of the no - show classes in summer 2011 , a lecture course that was instead treated as an independent study requiring a paper			1
the enrollment was 18 football players and one ex-player .			0
