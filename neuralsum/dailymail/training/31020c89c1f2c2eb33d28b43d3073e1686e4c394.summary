@entity0 was embroiled in a bitter social media row with the president of the @entity3 on friday after being branded ‘ a little girl ’ for his criticisms of sir @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity3 chief @entity8 aimed a puerile assault at the @entity10 after @entity0 , in his recent book @entity12 , lashed out at @entity6 ’s captaincy of the defeated @entity15 team at the @entity16			1
writing on his @entity18 account , @entity8 wrote : ‘ @entity6 ’s record stands by itself			1
six majors and all - time rc points			0
yours vs. his ? @entity24			0
’ @entity8 aimed an assault at @entity0 , who had criticised @entity6 's captaincy at the 2008 @entity27 @entity0 said the comments made by @entity8 were ' disappointing for the leader of the @entity3 ' in a separate post on his @entity32 page , @entity8 cited @entity0 ’s criticisms of @entity7 ’s decisions as @entity36 captain in this year ’s @entity27 , writing : ‘ used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticised the icons			1
‘ @entity7 ( 8 majors and a 10 - 3 - 1 @entity27 record ) and @entity6 ( 6 majors and all - time @entity27 points leader ) get bashed by @entity46			2
really ? sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess			0
@entity49 ! ’ @entity8 later deleted the messages , with @entity0 hitting back in a statement : ‘ is being called a “ lil girl ” meant to be derogatory or a put down ? @entity0 said sir @entity6 has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about @entity57 the @entity10 also hit out at @entity7 for dropping @entity58 and @entity59 at the @entity27 ‘ that ’s pretty shocking and disappointing , especially coming from the leader of the @entity3			1
’ the @entity3 said @entity8 , whose two - year term in the post ends next month , ‘ realised that his post was inappropriate and promptly removed it ’			2
the 60 - year - old later said : ‘ obviously i could have selected some different ways to express my thoughts on @entity0 ’s remarks			1
‘ @entity71 had always been a sport where respect was shown to its icons			0
that seems to have gone by the wayside			0
’ @entity6 is the only losing @entity15 @entity27 captain this century , and during commentary for this year ’s tournament he riled @entity80 ’s team when he said @entity57 was ‘ useless ’ during the loss in 2008			2
@entity0 and @entity57 ( right ) celebrate with the trophy after @entity15 's @entity27 victory earlier this year ‘ @entity6 has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said , ’ @entity0 wrote			1
‘ 2008 is the only @entity27 we ’ve lost in the last 15 years			0
so who ’s useless ? i think @entity6 might need to have a little look in the mirror			0
’ @entity0 was also critical of eight - time @entity93 winner @entity7 ’s call to drop @entity58 and @entity59 for both sessions on saturday at this year ’s @entity27 , which @entity15 won 16½ - 11½			2
@entity0 said @entity7 ’s decision - making ‘ completely baffles me ’ and called it ‘ utterly bizarre ’			1
@entity8 , a controversial figure in @entity36 golf , made 65 - year - old @entity7 the oldest captain in @entity27 history			0
he recently announced that a task force had been appointed to help solve @entity36 ’s recent losing streak in the @entity27 .			0
