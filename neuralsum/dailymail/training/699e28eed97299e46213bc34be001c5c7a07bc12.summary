by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 30 august 2013 he inspired a generation in the 1980s as television 's loveable wheeler - dealer @entity3 , who was always looking for a quick way to make easy money			2
but @entity3 star @entity8 is far from happy with his real - life next door neighbour , after he reveled plans to build his own sawmill next to his @entity14 property			1
his wife @entity15 - famously referred to as ' er indoors ' during the @entity18 drama - has also taken the news badly and has been prescribed valium to help her cope with the stress			1
@entity22 : @entity8 as @entity3 ( left ) in the 1980s tv show @entity3			1
@entity24 , @entity25 , who starred alongside him as @entity26 mrs @entity27 said : ' this was our safe place and suddenly it is n't anymore			1
' @entity8 has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems			1
' he has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet , otherwise he would n’t have been here for 70 years			2
' at our age we do not socialise except with our children and grandchildren			0
we never go away , we ’re always here			0
' mrs @entity27 claimed her actor husband , now 88 , was nothing like the over-the - top characters he once played on television and film , which included roles in @entity45			1
they fear that if their next - door neighbour , @entity47 , gets the go - ahead for his 90ft - long barn , which stands 24ft high , and is on the boundary of their properties , their properties , their quality of life will inevitably be affected			2
they claim they will be deprived of the peace and quiet they have enjoyed up to now and have called for the plan to be scrapped due to the loss of trees , impact on the environment and the noise the development will create			2
honour : @entity8 was made an obe in 1992 , pictured here with wife @entity15 at @entity71 they are not the only people fighting the plans for the site in @entity76			1
major general @entity77 owns a property with nearly 40 acres of woodland next to the site			0
he said : ' i very much doubt if i could justify setting up a sawmill to manage it even if i could get permission to cut the trees down			0
' i am therefore at a loss to understand where he will find the timber needed to operate a sawmill of some size , on just five acres of his own land , unless he intends to import it			0
' mr @entity47 explained he was having diseased trees cut down , which were too big for the local sawmill to process , and would have to be cut up on site and stored until they could be removed			0
he denied he was setting up the mill as a commercial venture insisting he would only be processing wood from his estate			0
he argued his proposal would result in less disruption than if lorries had to transport the trees from his land			0
he added : ' i am surprised by people ’s attitude to woodland management , especially in an area of such forestation that has many plantations and areas under the management of the @entity113 , which actively harvests trees			0
' upset : the actor @entity8 , 88 , is fighting his neighbour , who wants to build a sawmill on land next to his @entity14 home			1

tv *legend* , 88 , is *battling* his neighbour 's plans to build a sawmill
@entity8 and wife @entity15 fear the mill will harm their peace and quiet
the matter has caused mrs @entity27 so much stress she is on valium
