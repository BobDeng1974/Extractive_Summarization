@entity0 , the @entity1 man who was wrongfully convicted in 2001 of second - degree murder and freed after ten years in jail , has said reading @entity5 's book helped get him through some of his darkest days			1
in parallels to @entity0 's case , @entity5 and her former boyfriend @entity7 were also wrongfully imprisoned , serving four years in an @entity11 prison for the 2007 murder of @entity15 student @entity13			1
@entity0 has said he is able to identify with @entity5 on many levels			1
' i know first hand what it is like to have the world turn against you based on a series of lies , ' he said in a revealing post on @entity26			1
the sweet taste of freedom : @entity0 pictured enjoying a steak and a beer following his release from prison just a couple of hours earlier in november 2013 waiting to be read : @entity0 says he learned a lot about @entity5 's case by reading her book whilst in prison			1
he also drew comfort and inspiration from her words although @entity5 's original conviction was overturned in 2011 and she returned to the @entity43 , a retrial has been taking place over the past couple of weeks in @entity11			1
@entity46 was not required to be at the trial and has said she would not voluntarily go to @entity11 if she were ordered to return to prison			0
@entity46 , who became a free @entity0 supporter after hearing about his case , says the two have formed a close friendship since his release			1
‘ to get arrested and to get charged for a crime you did n't commit is incredibly easy , and you lose your life very fast , ’ @entity0 said upon his release from jail			1
‘ but to get out of prison , it takes an army			0
’ something in common : it 's no secret that @entity0 and @entity5 have become good friends since both were released			1
here @entity5 holds a sign welcoming @entity0 with her best friend @entity66 @entity11 's highest criminal court overturned @entity46 's acquittal in the 2007 murder of a @entity15 student and ordered a new trial			1
@entity0 , left , had been sentenced to 40 years for the 2001 murder of @entity73 , right , a newspaper sports editor @entity0 's case gained attention because his high school classmate , @entity77 , claimed to have recalled through dreams that he and @entity79 had killed @entity73 during a late - night robbery after a @entity81 of partying			1
@entity77 has since recanted his testimony but is still in prison			0
@entity0 has since revealed that while he was in prison , he read @entity5 's book , waiting to be @entity87			1
@entity0 has decided to speak publicly about @entity5 's case , saying he has studied her situation in depth			1
' i knew about @entity5 's case while i was in prison			2
they 're at this crucial point with their lives right now and to not say something , not speak up to not help spread awareness , it would be negligent , ' @entity0 said			2
wrongfully imprisoned : @entity5 , left , and @entity7 , are seen outside the rented house where 21 - year - old @entity15 student @entity13 was found dead in @entity102 , @entity11 like his own case of wrongful imprisonment , many people had a knee - jerk reaction to @entity46 's story based on misleading information that has leaked into the media			2
in his posting on @entity26 , @entity0 points out several facts about @entity46 's case for people to understand : 1 ) when @entity5 was initially interviewed by the @entity11 police she was badgered for hours in an interrogation that was later ruled illegal by an @entity11 appeals court			2
@entity5 eventually signed a false confession in a moment of desperation			2
25 % of wrongful convictions are the result of false confessions ( remember , my conviction also hinged on a false confession from @entity128 ) 2 ) there was plenty of dna evidence in the room in which @entity13 was murdered including blood and fingerprint samples			0
none of it matched @entity5			0
but it did match with @entity13 , who was later convicted of the murder			0
3 ) the only ' witnesses ' against @entity5 were later deemed unreliable by an appeals court			0
( sound familiar ? ) 4 ) @entity143 had a history of breaking and entering and wielding a knife			0
in the days following @entity13 's murder he fled the country			0
5 ) the prosecution did n't have any real facts to convict @entity5 – so turned the trial into a character assassination , presenting @entity46 as a crazed , sexual deviant			2
( in the same way my prosecution presented me at trial as a spoiled rich kid ) ' freed at last : after his release from jail last november , @entity0 , 29 , held an emotional press conference thanking his parents and the ' army ' of people who had helped in his struggle @entity0 notes that despite @entity5 being originally convicted of @entity168 ’s murder and then freed by an @entity11 appeals court , the current retrial that is taking place is as a result of an appeal launched by the prosecution			1
he believes the retrial is ' a politically motivated move [ by the prosecution ] to cover their mistakes			0
' if @entity46 loses this appeal she may be extradited to @entity11 to serve a life sentence for @entity168 's murder			0
if she is n't extradited she will essentially become a prisoner in her own country , never be able to leave the @entity43			2
the conviction with hang over her for the rest of her life			0
on his decision to speak out about @entity5 's predicament , he says the choice was a simple one for him to make			0
' people helped save my life and i feel like if i can do some small part in helping another person get their life back then i 'm going to do that			0
