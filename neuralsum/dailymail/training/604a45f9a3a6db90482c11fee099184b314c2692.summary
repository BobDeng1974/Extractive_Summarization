by @entity0 , @entity1 a year after considering quitting tennis , @entity2 is through to her first grand slam quarter - final for three years			1
in 2011 , the popular @entity5 made the last eight at three of the four slams and was ranked in the top 10			2
but back , ankle and knee injuries over the next 18 months sent her ranking plummeting to 177 when she finally returned to the tour for good in march last year			2
beaming : @entity5 's @entity2 celebrates after reaching the @entity14 quarter - finals after losing in the second round of qualifying at @entity14 last year , @entity2 thought about calling it a day			1
the 26 - year - old said : ' it was n't because i had lost in the second round against some player that was ranked 160			1
it was n't about that			2
it was just i did n't like playing any more			0
' i was putting so much pressure on myself to get back where i was , and it was n't fun any more			2
everything was work and hard			0
it was n't what it was , why i started playing tennis			0
' i started playing tennis because i love it and it 's a big part of my life			0
it brought so much to me and my family			0
' i think it brings so many people together , and it 's a nice , a beautiful thing , and it 's not something that is ugly and hard and difficult			0
' that 's what it was for me when i came back from my injuries			2
' my footwork was off , my strokes were bad			0
that 's why i wanted to stop			0
after that , i won a tournament , luckily , so i did n't , and i kept doing what i did			0
' and now i 'm here and it 's a nice reward			0
' back on form : @entity2 plays a forehand after her three - set victory in the fourth round that title came in @entity62 and final appearances in @entity64 and @entity65 followed , while in april she won the biggest tournament of her career in @entity68			1
@entity2 is back to 27th in the rankings and on monday beat surprise package @entity69 1 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 in the fourth round of the @entity14			1
the draw has undoubtedly worked out well but @entity2 has taken advantage , albeit a little hesitantly this time			2
she said : ' i was really relieved that i picked myself up after i was up 4 - 2 in the third and i started playing a little passively			2
' i was n't going for my shots any more			0
i was sort of hoping that she was going to miss. she 's too good for that			0
respect : @entity2 shakes hands with opponent @entity69 ( left ) after sealing victory ' after going down 5 - 4 in the third , i just told myself , " okay , listen , you have to play aggressive			1
you have to go for your shots , and nobody 's going to give you the quarter - finals just because you 're nice , so go gain it "			1
' i started playing more aggressively			0
it paid off in the end			0
' @entity2 will have to step up her game if she is to go any further with 2012 finalist @entity88 up next			1
the 10th seed defeated sixth seed @entity90 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) , 6 - 2 in a minor upset to make the quarter - finals for the third straight year			1
elation : @entity95 @entity88 celebrates her victory over @entity90 to reach the last eight in @entity98 the @entity99 was left to rue a missed opportunity , saying : ' it 's a big disappointment , especially when you see the draw and who is left in the draw			1
' it 's one of those @entity109 opens that opened up , especially for me			0
' @entity90 's exit means fourth seed @entity111 is the only member of the top six still @entity112 made just her second grand slam quarter - final thanks to a 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 victory over 15th seed @entity116			1
marching on : @entity118 's @entity117 beat @entity116 in straight sets at @entity14 there she will face 2009 champion @entity121 , who is once again having a good run at @entity14 and defeated @entity123 6 - 3 , 6 - 4			1
@entity121 is through to the last eight for the seventh time in the last nine years and last year troubled @entity126 at the same stage			1
on the run : @entity128 's @entity121 plays a forehand during her fourth - round match			1

@entity2 fought back from a set down to beat @entity69
the 26 - year - old considered *retiring* after losing in qualifying last year
