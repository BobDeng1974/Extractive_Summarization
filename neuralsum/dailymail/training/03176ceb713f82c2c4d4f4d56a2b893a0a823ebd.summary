by @entity1 medical correspondent arthritis sufferers had pain and stiffness relieved by more than 30 per cent using an extract from green lipped mussels , say researchers			1
the greatest rate of improvement came in the first two weeks , according to a new trial			2
but the benefits to hips and knees continued for three months while patients were taking the @entity16 capsules			2
the joint healing properties of green lipped mussels were first noticed more than 100 years ago by @entity18 in @entity19 , where they are sustainably harvested the joint healing properties of green lipped mussels were first noticed more than 100 years ago by @entity18 in @entity19 , where they are sustainably harvested			1
the capsules also contain hyaluronic acid , which is naturally found in the fluid lubricating joints in the body and is also used by doctors to tackle joint pain			2
around 10 million @entity28 suffer from joint problems every day , and it costs the @entity28 £ 5.7billion a year			1
in the latest @entity36 study , 53 people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee or hip were recruited by community physicians working in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			2
the patients asked to take @entity16 , a food supplement , for three months , and their symptoms were recorded at the start , monthly and two weeks after the trial was completed			2
their pain , stiffness , and difficulty moving was reported using a well - established scale known as the @entity51 and @entity52			0
the total scores improved by more than 30 per cent during the trial , when compared with their initial scores			0
the biggest fall of 15 per cent occurred during the first two weeks of taking the capsules			0
the score for ' global functioning - the ability to move more easily - improved by 14.2 per cent over the three - month period			0
only two weeks after stopping the capsules , total scores rose by 10 per cent			2
the study was managed by a clinical trial company and funded by the @entity65 , which makes the product			0
dr @entity67 a senior lecturer in @entity69 at @entity70 , said green lipped mussels are a potent source of an essential fatty acid known as eicosatetaenoic acid ( @entity75 ) and have a powerful anti-inflammatory action			1
she said people might be sceptical about supplements causing a marked improvement to joint pain , but there was scientific evidence supporting the use of green lipped mussels and other marine oils			1
@entity16 capsules : omega oils have an anti-inflammatory effect and this supplement contains green - lipped mussel extract , which is particularly rich in them degeneration of the joints also related to the quantity and quality of hyaluronic acid present , she added			1
' as a nation we eat too little fish but the reason for calling them essential fatty acids is because they are not produced in the body , they have to come from dietary sources or as supplements			0
' there is now good evidence this kind of supplementation helps people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis , although it 's unlikely to work for patients with severe joint problems			1
it 's best to catch it early			0
' more research is needed into optimal levels , but most people 's diet is deficient as a result of our under - consumption of fish ' she said			0
new zealander @entity129 , who now lives near @entity130 where he works in marketing , eats green lipped mussels because of the health benefits			1
he said ' it 's well known in @entity19 that green lipped mussels have health benefits , and they taste good , but they 're not always easy to get hold of			1
' i 'm quite sporty , and being 37 in june feel i 've got to take some preventive action to help my joints and it 's easier to take capsules			0
' a spokesman for medical research charity @entity144 said : ' although we do n’t really understand how green - lipped mussel works , we do know that extracts contain omega - 3 fatty acids , amino acids , minerals and carbohydrates			1
' @entity152 fatty acids are important for maintaining cell structure and function , so this could explain how and why it works in some people			0
' we recently reviewed the clinical trial data for green lipped mussel and found that there is some promising evidence to suggest that it works			1
' as a result we awarded it an effectiveness score of three ( out of five )			0
apart from causing nausea and flatulence in some people it appears to be reasonably well - tolerated			0
