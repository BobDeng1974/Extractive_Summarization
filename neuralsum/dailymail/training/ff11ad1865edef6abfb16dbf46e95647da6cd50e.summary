by @entity0 published : 14:22 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:38 est , 7 february 2014 plans have been submitted to develop the world 's first tidal lagoon energy project in the @entity6			2
and the ground - breaking project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in @entity10 , @entity11 for 120 years			0
developers behind the £ 750million to £ 850million @entity14 project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the @entity6 's electricity needs from the tides			1
an artist 's impression of the proposed @entity21 , which if developed would be the world 's first tidal lagoon energy project and provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in @entity10 for 120 years the developers say the £ 750million project , along with four others could meet 10 per cent of the @entity6 's electricity needs from the tides by 2023			1
the six - mile wall around @entity14 complete with turbines could generate electricity 14 hours a day			1
@entity33 believes the project will boost a @entity6 supply chain and create a new export market if it gets the go - ahead			1
the project includes creating a 10km sea reef , the reintroduction of the native oyster to @entity14 and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities			2
it would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year			1
1,850 construction jobs would be created plus 150 long - term jobs in its operation			0
the scheme would involve a six - mile ( 9.5km ) wall built around @entity14 , which would create a lagoon in the @entity54 with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day			1
if it gets the go - ahead , the lagoon could be the first of a series of five developments around the @entity6 , coast which could generate as much as 10 per cent of the @entity6 's electricity by 2023			1
@entity33 , the company behind the project , said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the @entity6 , boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market			1
the project includes creating a 10km sea reef , the reintroduction of the native oyster to @entity14 and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities			2
according to the developers , research as part of the project 's initial stages found that 86 per cent of local residents were in favour of the scheme			2
the @entity14 project would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year and create 1,850 construction jobs			1
around 150 long - term jobs in operation and the leisure facilities would also be created in the area while the development would also boost jobs in the wider supply chain , the company said			2
if the ambitious scheme ( illustrated ) gets the go - ahead , the lagoon could be the first of a series of five developments around the @entity6 , coast which could generate as much as 10 per cent of the @entity6 's electricity by 2023 ‘ until now , tidal energy has been heavily promoted by governments and environmentalists as an intuitive source of clean and reliable energy for our island nation , but the business response has focused on relatively small - scale tidal stream devices , @entity110 , chief executive of @entity33 said			1
‘ the @entity6 has the second highest tidal range in the world and today we are submitting an application for a development that will prove that this resource can be harnessed in a way that makes economic , environmental and social sense			0
‘ tidal lagoons offer renewable energy at nuclear scale and thus the investment of hundreds of millions of pounds in @entity6 industries and coastal communities			0
’ he added : ‘ our intention is to supply 10 per cent of the @entity6 's domestic electricity by building at least five full - scale tidal lagoons in @entity6 waters by 2023 , before the @entity6 sees any generation from new nuclear			1
’ it is believed that building more , larger lagoons would bring economies of scale			0
the project would expect to benefit from subsidies levied on energy bills for clean power , but mr @entity110 said a second lagoon would require a lower level of support than offshore wind			0
the project is the latest plan to harness the huge tidal power of the @entity54 , after a separate scheme for a barrage across the estuary failed to win political support amid concerns that the economic and environment case for it did not stack up			0
the new @entity156 is pictured a third lagoon , he suggested , would be competitive with the support received by new nuclear plants but without the decommissioning costs and safety concerns			0
and other sites where lagoons are being considered , such as the @entity166 coast , could have added benefits such as flood defences			0
the developers have submitted an application that will now be considered by the @entity171			0
if the application is accepted it will then be assessed with a final decision expected from the @entity175 in early 2015			0
if the go - ahead is given , construction could start next year , with the first power generated by 2018 , the company said			2
