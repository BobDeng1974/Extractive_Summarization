the @entity1 feature was quietly introduced to @entity2 a year ago it is tracking your every move – recording the exact time you left for work , where you bought your coffee and where you like to shop			1
but this is n’t a futuristic spy drone or some sinister @entity12 state – it ’s the @entity2 sitting in your pocket			1
hidden in @entity16 phones is a function which logs every journey			1
the iphones are then able to analyse the data to figure out where you live and work , basing decisions on the frequency and timing of trips			1
the function – called the @entity28 feature – was quietly introduced to @entity2 a year ago			1
but since access to the programme is buried beneath five layers of settings menus , few people know it exists			2
@entity16 claims the data never leaves your phone without your permission , and that it was only designed to improve mapping services			1

‘ every place you go , where you shop , where you have a drink – it is all recorded			0
this is a divorce lawyer ’s dream			0
but what horrifies me is that it is so secret			0
why did we not know about this ? ’ smartphones have had the ability to track their owners ’ movements since they were first installed with gps chips and mapping functions			1

the revelation comes at the end of a week in which @entity16 saw £ 12billion wiped off its value after a glitch left @entity2 6 owners unable to get a signal – and some owners of the new slimline @entity95 bent their frames			1
in an open letter this month , @entity16 chief executive @entity97 said : ‘ our business model is very straightforward			2
we do n’t “ monetize ” the information on your @entity2 or in @entity103			2
’ but professor @entity40 said : ‘ @entity16 might promise not to use our location information for advertising			1
