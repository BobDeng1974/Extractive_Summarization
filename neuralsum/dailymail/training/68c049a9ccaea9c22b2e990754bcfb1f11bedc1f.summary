@entity0 claims many modern footballers have developed a ' soft underbelly ' which influences their decisions when the going gets tough			1
@entity0 was writing in the @entity6 programme at the end of a week when debate has swirled around @entity10 teenager @entity9 since he told @entity12 manager @entity11 he was feeling tired			1
' i was no @entity9 , let ’s get that clear , but at 19 years of age i was working 40 hours a week in an engineering factory in @entity17			1
i used to get up a 5am every morning , catch a bus to work and clock on at 6am , ' said the former @entity22 , @entity6 and @entity21 striker			0

he has claimed modern players have a soft underbelly ' at 3pm i would clock off , catch another bus to @entity28 where @entity30 ’s first - team coach @entity29 would be waiting for me at 3.30pm to take me into the gym to work on my heading , control , fitness and other aspects of my game			1
around 5pm i ’d shower and walk home to get some dinner then collapse into my bed			0
' i did this roughly three times a week along with a wednesday reserve team game for one season			0
i was tired and exhausted most of the time , sometimes too tired to go out socially with my friends at weekends , but i did it because i wanted to be a professional footballer			0
' @entity0 , who was at @entity48 for the game against @entity50 , added : ' when i turned pro at 20 , i can categorically tell you that during my worst moments in football like getting booed and racially abused by my own fans at @entity22 , or going 17 games without a goal at @entity6 , i never asked to be left out of the team			2
@entity9 complained of feeling tired while on international duty with @entity12 last week ' on those days , social media was n't born , no slogans were written on the walls of the training grounds and senior players kept the younger players in check			1
someone would utter that old phrase : ' when the going gets tough , the tough get going ' and no player wanted to show signs of weakness			0
' things have changed a bit since those days but there is a soft underbelly to a lot of the guys playing the game nowadays			1
' too much reward too soon is n’t something that can be reversed in football nowadays but at times it might be an easy way out when the going gets tough			0
' i 'm not suggesting that @entity9 is doing this but i 've heard players spend countless hours playing @entity88 15 on @entity89 or @entity90 , sometimes well into the early hours of the morning			2
' what players must do is make sure they are preparing themselves in the correct manner , in which they can maximise their full potential			0
' @entity9 was left out of the starting line up against @entity97 after a chat with manager @entity11			2
