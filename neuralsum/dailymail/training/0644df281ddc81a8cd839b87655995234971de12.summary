by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 8 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:10 est , 9 december 2013 personal ? a study in @entity4 has found each person interprets smells differently it is an age - old problem			1
why is it so difficult to buy perfume for a loved one ? well , scientists may have come up with the answer - but it does n’t make picking a gift any easier			2
we all think we know how certain things smell			0
but to someone else that same bottle of perfume - or piece of cheese , or glass of wine - may smell completely differently			2
@entity24 scientists have discovered that we all experience odours in a completely different way			0
their paper , published in the @entity29 journal , reveals that 30 per cent of smell receptors differ between any two people			1
each single receptor can alter the way each person perceives an odour			0
dr @entity35 , a molecular biologist at the @entity37 in @entity4 , said : ‘ for different items there is a big gap between what you smell and what i smell			1
‘ the amount of variation was really surprising to us - it was about 30 per cent of receptors are different between two individuals at random			0
that is a pretty high number			0
’ the human nose contains 400 different olfactory receptors - and dr @entity35 ’s team found that changing a single receptor could dramatically change the way a person perceives a smell			1
good or bad ? while some detect the aromatic smell of sandalwood from a scented candle , others smell it as pee dr @entity35 said : ‘ the activation pattern of these 400 receptors encodes both the intensity of an odour and the quality – for example , whether it smells like vanilla or smoke – for the tens of thousands of different odours that represent everything we smell			1
’ changing one particular receptor meant that some people smell a specific type of steroid as a pleasant sandalwood - while others thought it smells like pee			2
‘ it is very different , ’ dr @entity35 said			1
‘ one person might find it to be mild and pleasant and by changing that single receptor another might find it to be as a very strong and urinous			0
’ the researchers cloned 511 receptors and embedded them in host cells in the laboratory			0
they then measured how each receptor responded to a panel of 73 different odours			0
the process identified 28 different ways that each array of receptors would respond to the different odours			0
the team used mathematical models to extrapolate the findings , and came up with the result that 140 of their 400 receptors - about 30 per cent - of any two individuals would be different			1
dr @entity35 said the results may enable scientists to accurately create different smells			1
‘ the long - term goal is to figure out how the receptors encode odour molecules well enough that we can actually create any odour we want by manipulating the receptors directly			2

human nose has 400 different receptors - one change could be dramatic
paper published by @entity37 in @entity4 found one thing could smell like sandalwood to some and urine to others
