claims : @entity1 , who is serving a life sentence for terror charges , has said @entity4 financed the 9/11 attacks a jihadist serving life in prison on terror charges brought in the wake of 9/11 has claimed the @entity4 royal family helped finance the plot			1
@entity1 , 46 , says an unnamed @entity13 paid for flying lessons for him and the 19 terrorists who hijacked planes in the september 11 attacks in the run - up to the atrocities			1
the incredible claims were made in documents filed to a federal court in @entity23 , in which @entity1 says a prince ' was assisting me in my @entity27 terrorist activities ... and was doing so knowingly for @entity28 '			1
he also said that @entity28 provided assistance from @entity4 leaders in planning the attacks , and that he was involved in a plot to shoot down @entity33 with president @entity34 on board			2
the @entity4 government has flatly denied any involvement in 9/11			1
@entity1 's own credibility is also suspect - as even @entity28 has denied he had anything to do with his terrorist plots			1
lawyers for the federal government have taken him seriously enough to interview him over the claims at the maximum security @entity46 prison where he is serving a life sentence without parole			1
they say he had ' relevant ' material to contribute			2
however , officials in @entity23 have said @entity1 's requests to be allowed to speak in open court and to be assigned government lawyers will probably be denied , as his claims have nothing to do with any existing cases			1
' even if he somehow got to the point where he could testify , there would be a credibility issue , ' said @entity60 , a professor at the @entity61			0
' would his testimony be valuable ? that 's doubtful			0
' court battles : @entity1 cut a bizarre figure in his three - year - long trial on terror charges			1
above , a court sketch shows him celebrating as he is sentenced to life in a maximum security prison the offers are also clouded by his record of changing his account of his involvement in the sept. 11 plot and his erratic behavior in court			1
in court papers filed in @entity80 in september , lawyers for @entity4 said flatly : ' the @entity4 had no role in the attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
' they also noted that the @entity83 ' has said often and vigorously that @entity4 is an important ally in the fight against terrorism			2
' even so , his attempts to cooperate in the civil cases stand in contrast to the defiant attitudes of other @entity93 defendants who have endured after years of confinement without volunteering information except for claims they were tortured			0
@entity1 , who is 46 and refers to himself in writing as ' @entity99 , ' was first arrested on immigration charges in august 2001 after employees of a @entity103 flight school became alarmed that he wanted to learn to fly a @entity106 747 - even though he had no pilot 's license			1
atrocity : according to @entity1 , an unnamed @entity4 prince supported him , and the 19 hijackers who flew planes into buildings on september 11 , 2001 , while they were training to fly ' nothing to do with me ' : a 2006 video message , above , purportedly from @entity28 , featured a voice saying @entity1 was nothing to do with 9/11 he was in custody on september 11 , 2001 , and pleaded guilty in april 2005 to conspiring with the hijackers to kill @entity83			1
during his three - year legal fight , @entity1 repeatedly insulted the judge and tried to fire his lawyers			1
at one point he was facing the death penalty , which jurors decided against			0
during the hearing he spontaneously declared that he had planned to pilot a plane into the @entity127 on september 11			0
a psychologist called by his lawyers testified that @entity1 had paranoid schizophrenia			2
@entity1 mocked the testimony , shouting as he left courtroom , ' crazy or not crazy ? that is the question			0
' in 2006 a recording emerged online of @entity28 distancing himself from @entity1			2
he said : ' he had no connection at all with september 11			0
i am the one in charge of the 19 brothers , and i never assigned brother @entity138 to be with them in that mission			0
' response : the @entity4 government said it had nothing whatsoever to do with the september 11 attacks last month , lawyers in a federal lawsuit against @entity4 were permitted to interview @entity1 in prison			1
what was said ca n't be shared publicly until the @entity83 government finishes sifting through the transcript to ensure it contains no secret messages that could pose a threat to @entity83			0
@entity153 , a lawyer who interviewed him , said : ' i will say that we believe it was relevant and material to our case			2
' @entity1 also wrote to the clerk in federal court in @entity160 in september , saying he had seen a report on @entity162 about another suit accusing the @entity165 - based @entity164 of helping finance suicide bombings in @entity167			2
he said he was willing to testify , but the plaintiffs never took it seriously			0
the communication was n't relevant to the @entity164 case and ' do n't make clear what his motives are , ' said one lawyer , @entity174			0
' i do n't know his state of mind at all			0
' at @entity176 - known as the ' @entity177 of the @entity178 ' - @entity1 is subject to restrictions requiring screening of any attempt to communicate with the outside world			0
however , there are exceptions for court filings .			0

@entity1 , 46 , filed court documents claiming @entity4 *funded* 9/11

@entity1 was given life sentence in 2006 after admitting terror charges
