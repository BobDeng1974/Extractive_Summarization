regrets : one in 20 people think they should have married an ex-partner and 16 per cent feel they wasted years with the wrong partner more than half of those surveyed admitted wishing they had made a different life choice at some point , such as having a different career , living somewhere else or marrying someone different			1
a fifth of women regretted wasting time with the wrong partner , compared to 10 per cent of men			1
but a quarter of the 2,000 participants said they did not believe it was possible to live a life without regrets , perhaps explaining why , on average , we spend 19 minutes per day – or more than two hours a week – thinking about things we could have done differently			1

not taking a gap year more than a third of us blame a lack of cash for preventing us from fulfilling our dreams , while 25 per cent think loved ones held us back			0
but 32 per cent admitted that the blame lay with their own lack of courage , according to the research by the @entity73			0
dr @entity74 , senior lecturer at the @entity75 , said : ‘ there seems to be a certain air of resignation amongst us that living out our dreams may simply not be possible for a variety of reasons			0
’ but perhaps in an effort to ensure we have fewer regrets to dwell on in future , the survey also revealed that we have a rather ambitious ‘ to do ’ list – with winning the lottery our number one goal			1
