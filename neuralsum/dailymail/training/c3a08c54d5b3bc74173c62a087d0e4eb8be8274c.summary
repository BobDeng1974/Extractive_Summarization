tens of thousands of people could be helped to buy newly - built homes worth up to £ 500,000 after the @entity3 said it would use £ 1billion of taxpayers ’ money to ensure they get mortgages with just a 5 per cent deposit			1
prime minister @entity9 today launched a scheme that is designed to guarantee risky mortgages for all home buyers in a bid to kickstart the flagging property market			1
the move heralds the return of 5 per cent deposits rather than the 20 per cent typically demanded by lenders since the credit crunch			2
it could save buyers £ 34,000 on the average house			1
but mps were warned that the @entity25 scheme , which could allow people to put as little equity as £ 11,000 into a £ 228,000 house , could spark another credit crisis			1
help : @entity9 , seen meeting aspiring home owners today , launched the @entity31 to enable such couples to buy homes with a deposit of 5 per cent , rather than the 20 % figure most have to find @entity37 mp @entity36 said that by allowing may reinflate the housing bubble which burst at the start of the financial crisis			1
once again this could lead to banks repossessing homes and families being forced from their houses as they failed to make repayments , the member for @entity48 said			2
during a @entity51 debate , he said : ' while we all want house building to get moving again and get first - time buyers on the housing ladder , is it not true that 95 % mortgages and even higher were what went wrong with the housing market in the first place ? ' wo n't any attempt to artificially prop up house building with government subsidy just come back and bite us ? ' @entity64 and @entity65 are typical of thousands of homeowners who find themselves unable to move up the housing ladder			1
the couple , pictured below , bought their two - bedroom terrace home in @entity72 , @entity73 , in august 2007 , and while they have been happy there , @entity64 , 33 , a vet , and @entity65 , 34 , a civil servant , would like more room for a growing family			2
they have a son , 22 - month - old @entity80 , as well as a dog and a cat			2
@entity64 says : ‘ we paid just under £ 250,000 for this house , but similar properties are on the market for about £ 230,000 to £ 235,000			2
‘ when you factor in moving costs and how much we ’d have to pay to move up to a three - bedroom home , even in a cheaper area , we ’d need to have a deposit and moving fund of about £ 50,000			1
and at the moment , saving that sort of sum is completely out of our reach			0
’ @entity96 says : ‘ if you are stuck in this position , your first step should be to talk to your present lender and see what it might be prepared to do			0
’ some lenders might relax their borrowing limits slightly if they are dealing with a customer who has a good record of repayments			0
others have a range of incentives aimed at trapped homeowners			0
@entity112 runs an equity support scheme for existing borrowers , including those with @entity116 and @entity118 mortgages			1
under the @entity25 scheme , which is open to aspiring as well as actual home owners , the government will stump up 5.5 per cent of the value of a mortgage on a home worth up to £ 500,000			1
and the housebuilder will put up 3.5 per cent to help guarantee mortgage lenders against any losses and stimulate a wave of fresh lending			2
buyers would still be required to come up with the 5 per cent deposit and pay off the full loan in time - worth up to 95 per cent of the value of their home			1
but if they defaulted , the house builders ' and @entity3 's money would be kept by the lender			0
@entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 said they are ready to start lending under the scheme , while @entity144 aims to make products available by the middle of the year and @entity116 is expected to follow suit			1
@entity148 said the scheme is already proving popular and nearly 20,000 people have registered interest on its website			0
currently , most prospective buyers are expected to have saved twice their annual income to have enough cash to put down a 20 per cent deposit - worth £ 45,665 on an average £ 228,385 house			1
but , if lenders will provide a mortgage with a 5 per cent deposit , they would only need to have saved £ 11,419			0
however , the project , which could help up to 100,000 people , has been derided by critics as a gimmick that will help the construction industry rather than struggling home buyers			1
they say such deals are pointless unless they are cheaper than other 95 per cent mortgage offers that are - despite most deals vanishing after the credit crunch - open to some bank customers			1
@entity171 , of your mortgage decisions , said : ' you can already obtain 95 per cent mortgages with comparable interest rates of 5 per cent plus			1
' it 's more of a gimmick			0
it 's a great headline and it will help some but mainly the construction industry			1
' all this will do is encourage people to buy new properties but old property wo n't be sold and the chain will stop			0
' also , there are fears that a widespread return to home buyers requiring only 5 per cent deposits could trigger another crash if currently low interest rates were to rise significantly			0
before the credit crunch , loans of up to 125 per cent of home value were possible			1
@entity196 , ceo of @entity197 , said : ‘ the government 's @entity25 guarantee scheme , like many such schemes over the years , smacks of desperation			1
‘ the property market will come back when it is ready to come back and schemes like this are mere tinkering around the edges			0
‘ if the government thinks this scheme will kickstart the property market then it is in @entity211			0
‘ the concern is that @entity25 is intrinsically leveraged , and we know where leveraging got us in the past			1
‘ people should buy when they are genuinely in a robust position to do so , not because a bank says they can buy			0
’ housing minister @entity219 said criteria for lending were much stricter since the credit crisis			1
he added : ' the problem was sub-prime lending , not 95 per cent mortgages , which operated perfectly well in this country for many decades			2
' the problem was lending to people who simply could n't afford to pay back the mortgages			0
' separately , two million occupants of social housing will be offered subsidies of up to £ 75,000 in the biggest extension of @entity235 ’s flagship right - to - buy policy for decades			2
drop : the graph shows how the number of new houses being built has plummeted since the credit crunch ministers say that for every home sold , the government will provide a new ‘ affordable ’ home , the majority of which are expected to be newly built			0
as well as helping buyers to get into the market , the scheme is intended to support 50,000 jobs in construction and related industries			1
the prime minister said : ‘ strong families and stable communities are built from good homes			0
that ’s why i want us to build more homes and i want more people to have the chance to own their own home			2
‘ we are acting today across the board to make this happen			0
‘ we ’re re-booting the right to buy scheme to increase discounts for two million tenants in social housing in @entity270			0
‘ and we ’re delivering on our promise to offer affordable mortgages to buyers who might otherwise not be able to raise the money to buy a newly - built home			1
it ’s no good hoping people will climb the property ladder if the bottom rung is missing			0
affordable properties and available mortgages are vital			0
’ chancellor @entity282 will use his budget later this month to signal a major housebuilding programme , with plans for around 500,000 new homes and a relaxation of planning laws			0
the right - to - buy scheme was introduced by @entity235 in 1980 , but @entity37 put the brakes on the programme when it came to power			2
currently right - to - buy discounts are capped at £ 16,000 in most of @entity294 , and £ 38,000 in other parts of the country			2
under the government ’s plans , they are expected to be doubled			0
currently , banks are reluctant to lend more than 75 per cent of a property ’s value , so the government has had to underwrite the risk to persuade them to take part			0
following in her footsteps : @entity9 has pledged to ' reboot ' @entity235 's right - to - buy scheme by offering council tenants discounts of up to £ 75,000 but under the @entity25 scheme , the deals mean that rather than typical buyers saving a £ 40,000 deposit , they will now only need £ 10,000			1
@entity316 , @entity37 ’s shadow housing minister , said : ‘ today ’s announcement is too little too late , but at least it ’s something from a government that has done virtually nothing to tackle the worst housing crisis in a generation			0

£ *1bn* of taxpayers ' cash to be used to guarantee loans for new - build homes
@entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 to offer 95 % mortgages under scheme
but @entity331 fear @entity25 deal , which is open to all buyers , could spark another credit crisis
and deal is derided as gimmick that will only help construction industry
