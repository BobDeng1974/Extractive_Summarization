by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 8 november 2013 alone in the darkness , in icy waters on the sea bed , her rusting hulk symbolises the sacrifice so many made for freedom			0
this is the ghostly image of @entity9 , torpedoed by a @entity11 u-boat during one of the blackest days of the @entity13			1
the magnificent battleship ’s guns lie twisted in the deep , her once - proud tower broken and buried by the sands of the last seven decades			0
tragedy : 800 officers were killed in the attack on @entity9 on october 14 , 1939 as it sat in the @entity23 sea			1
it sank in 13 minutes after being torpedoed cheap : @entity27 leaders ordered for the battleship to be cheaper than they could afford			1
but as war approached they backtracked and weighed it down with weaponry but today , after a poignant mission ahead of tomorrow ’s @entity35 commemorations , a white ensign was raised once again from the ship			2
@entity38 divers carried a new standard 80ft below the surface of @entity40 in the @entity23 , where the warship sunk in 1939 , and attached it to the upturned hull			1
it is an annual ritual performed to underline an eternal promise - that those who gave their lives would never be forgotten			0
remembering : a naval diver replaced the @entity49 - a @entity50 and @entity52 's flag - on the wreck of @entity9 in the @entity40 in the @entity23 wartime : she faced @entity57 's bombers while protecting the borders of @entity59 during the @entity60 1936 - 9			1
the ship also starred in a film as a @entity64 rebel vessel ' @entity65 ' as she was known , was a revenge class battleship built in @entity68 and launched in 1914			2
she first saw action at the @entity71			0
the 29,000 ton ship had a top speed of 20 knots and an impressive array of guns			2
but by the time @entity13 broke out she was deemed unsuitable for front - line action			0
she was sunk while anchored at @entity40 , the wartime home of the fleet , on october 14 , 1939			1
the war was just 41 days old			0
a u-boat captained by @entity11 naval ace @entity83 sneaked through a blockade into the supposedly safe haven , and fired a series of torpedoes			1
three scored direct hits and the ship took only around ten minutes to sink			1
@entity9 was loaded with fuel and ammunition - so regular safety inspections of the wreck have to be carried out along the wreck 's 620ft ( 189m ) hull			1
twelve years ago , 97 - year - old war widow @entity96 was reunited with her late husband @entity97 when her ashes were placed in a weighted casket in the ship on which he died			2
six weeks into the war , 833 sailors were killed when the ship went down in minutes after being attacked at anchor			1
most were killed by fire , many as they slept in their hammocks			0
of those who escaped , few survived the freezing cold sea			2
more than 100 of the ship ’s 1,234 compliment were ‘ boy sailors ’ , the war ’s biggest loss of these brave teenage seamen , assigned to the @entity115 fleet before they became ordinary seamen at 18			1
in a sombre ceremony , ten divers from the @entity118 , based at @entity119 , raised the flag in the eerie underwater silence before attaching it to an upper propshaft and saluting the memory of the fallen			2
normally , the white ensign is flown at all times when @entity38 ships are underway			1
here , it could hardly flutter in the same way as the one on a nearby shore memorial does - but at least the current allowed it to stay unfurled with some dignity			0
this was still a war grave , after all , and hundreds of ordinary men and boys , who once served beneath this flag ’s wartime forebear , lay inside			2
the ship ’s previous ensign was recovered and will be presented to the @entity142			1
the haunting picture of @entity9 was created technologically 12 years ago by joining together a series of photographs and video clips , the only possible way to visualise the wreck through the murky waters as a single image			1
even on the clearest days , visibility is limited to around 50ft ; on bad days , to virtually nothing			0
after the ensign was in place , the diving group ’s commanding officer , lieutenant commander @entity153 , paid tribute to the dead and their sacrifice			0
‘ diving on the @entity9 is a timely reminder to the younger members of the team of the @entity115 ’s maritime heritage and the great contribution the @entity38 made , ’ he said			1
‘ for many at the time , this tragedy symbolised the beginning of the war in the realisation that nowhere was safe - and the country was at war at home just as much as it was on the @entity174			0
’ having survived the @entity176 , she narrowly missed bombs thrown by @entity57 's pilot during the @entity179 while conducting ' non intervention patrols ' around the coast			2
in 1937 she also starred in a melodramatic movie , @entity182 , as a @entity64 rebel ship , @entity184 , commandeered by @entity185			0
despite the relatively shallow water in which she sank , the majority of bodies could not be recovered from @entity9			1
the wreck has been designated a war grave and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the @entity195			0
ritual : officers remember the site , now an official war grave , every year			0
this time , they recovered the original flag and took it to display ' diving on the @entity9 is a timely reminder to the younger members of the team of the @entity115 's maritime heritage , ' lt cdr @entity153 said the brass letters that formed @entity9 's name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s			1
after being returned twenty years later , they were displayed in the @entity40 visitor centre in @entity212			0
a memorial at @entity214 in nearby @entity215 displays a plaque dedicated to those who lost their lives and a book of names			0
this list of names was not released by the government until 40 years after the sinking			0
a page of the book is turned every week .			0

@entity9 was fired three times by @entity11 in the early hours of october 14 , 1939 , in @entity23 , @entity229
1,200 crew members were alseep below deck . just *325* survived the attack , which sunk the ship in 13 minutes
a team of @entity38 officers have recovered the original flag and replaced it to *honour* to memories of the sailors
