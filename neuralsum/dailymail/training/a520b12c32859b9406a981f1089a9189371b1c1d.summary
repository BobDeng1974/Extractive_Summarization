these are the pictures proving that there is finally love and happiness for the boy who suffered the most appalling neglect when his @entity6 adoptive mother sent him on a plane back to his @entity9 motherland with a note saying she no longer wanted him			1
@entity11 , a 34 - year - old nurse , unilaterally revoked her adoption of @entity13 , then seven , that she had agreed after travelling to @entity9 and plucking him from an orphanage in 2009 offering him a new life in the @entity17			1
less than a year later the child had virtually forgotten his @entity9 when he was unceremoniously dumped alone on the plane and sent back to @entity19 , with a note ' to whom it may concern ' saying : ' i no longer wish to parent this child '			1
@entity26 , aged nine , is now living with a foster family outside @entity19			1
last spring his @entity6 adoptive mother put @entity26 , who was then going by the @entity6 name @entity13 , alone on a plane to @entity9 with a note pinned to his clothing her action sparked worldwide outrage and a diplomatic rift between @entity19 and @entity35 , as the @entity9 authorities - left to pick up the pieces - desperately sought a suitable home for a child who @entity11 also cruelly labelled ' mentally unstable '			1
the @entity41 's tsar for children @entity43 took a personal interest in the case but despite his efforts , initially the right home for the boy eluded them			2
yet now almost two years on from his horror flight , @entity13 finally feels loved and cared for - thanks to a remarkable @entity9 foster mother			1
once again , he now lives under the name he was born with - @entity26 - and he is approaching his tenth birthday			1
@entity53 , 53 , is the woman he now calls @entity54			2
she is an ' @entity55 mother ' in @entity57 village , part of an unusual and highly effective project to rescue society 's most neglected children			2
a former office worker , she has no children of her own yet she now mothers six , all under 18 , and has 11 more who have grown up and left her village			2
to her , they are all her sons and daughters , and she raises them with her husband @entity68 , 46			2
' @entity26 came to live with us on 25 october last year ( 2011 ) , ' she recalled			1
' we had a party that day - my daughter @entity71 turned 9 - we invited @entity26 to join us and eat something but he was not so keen			1
' @entity26 now calls @entity53 , right , @entity54			1
she and her husband hope to adopted him and five other children they have been fostering			2
the @entity41 's tsar for children , @entity43 , left , has a special interest in @entity26 's case and makes periodic visits he was ' exhausted by plane flights and going back and forth between orphanages and foster parents ' , she said			1
' he then walked around our house , met the other children			0
i went with him saying - ' look , this is your home now , you will live with us here , in our family '			0
' i told him there are two more kids of the his age and he would not feel lonely			0
in the evening our kids talked to him and told about our life - that we are one family here , kids call each other brothers and sister , and here are your mother and father			0
' we do n't say orphanage , and we want @entity26 to find a good family here , not just another orphanage			1
' next day @entity26 began to call me ' mama '			1
he asked me for a notebook and a pen and said he wanted to write a diary			0
' he also went to our local school			0
now , almost six months later , i can say he 's coping well			0
he is a good student in school , not the very best but all is fine			0
there are a few slight behavioural problems , but this is natural , he 's a typical boy			0
he went to the winter camp with other kids for @entity118 and learned to skate			0
he says he likes it here , especially that we are a family rather than an orphanage			0
' her description of him is far from the label that @entity11 and her mother tagged him with before packing him back to @entity9			1
@entity53 says @entity26 is a good student in school , not the very best but fine			1
and unlike the claims of his former adoptive mother , @entity53 says there are only slight behavioural problems that are typical of a boy ' @entity26 is a nice boy , very kind and responsive			1
he is also very reasonable , as if he is older than his years , ' said @entity53			0
' he likes to help me around the house , to clean and cook			0
the other day he helped me to clean and fry potatoes			0
' i simply do not see that @entity26 has problems communicating with other children			1
i think he is mentally normal , there 's no problem to establish good contact with him			2
he is just a child with a very sad life experience and our task is to help him			0
one day if he wants to tell me his story , i 'll listen carefully , but i wo n't push him , if he wants to forget it , it is his right to do so			0
' before @entity11 chose him at the orphanage in the far east of @entity9 , he had been neglected and rejected once already - by his natural mother , who was stripped of her parental rights by a @entity9 court			1
it is hard to know how the impact of his treatment will affect him as he gets older but @entity53 is confident she can help him to grow up normally			0
' i was shocked when i heard @entity26 's story , who would n't be ? ' whatever happened in his @entity6 family , that woman did not have a moral right to throw him away like a useless thing			1
' i am sure there is a clever legal way to cancel adoption if it is all going wrong so i can not begin to understand why she chose such an inhuman way			0
' she said that @entity26 now wants to forget his time in the @entity6 , so painful was the ending			1
' he does not like to recall anything about @entity6 and does not want to answer any questions about it			0
he openly tells me this			0
' she stressed : ' frankly , i was also surprised to know that normal healthy kids like @entity26 can be adopted by foreigners			1
i was sure before that it was sick and disabled kids can go to live abroad where foreign people have money and facilities to help them and take proper care			0
@entity183 nurse @entity11 took a trip to @entity9 in 2009 and met @entity26 , who she renamed @entity13 , in an orphanage			1
their meeting is pictured here ' i do not think it is right to let healthy good @entity9 kids to leave our country			1
we must take better take care of them ourselves			0
' ' i am glad that @entity194 gave me the chance to work and live here			0
' i became a mum here , i started a family , i just became happy here			0
i am so proud that i am a mum of 17 kids , can you believe it ? @entity26 is the 17th and he is loved as much as all the others which is as much as any child can be loved			1
' my elder kids come to see me with their children and they all call me grandma			0
' this way @entity26 and the other younger children see that they will have a proper family , too , after they grow up			1
' my husband and i now plan to officially adopt all the six kids including @entity26 who live with us now , so we will be a totally normal legal family , ' she confided			1
@entity43 's determination that right must be done by this child have paid off , and the @entity41 official regularly finds time to visit and check up on @entity26 's progress			2
@entity53 spoke as a @entity6 judge this week ruled that @entity11 , from @entity221 in @entity183 , must pay child support even though she has not been prosecuted for neglect			2
worth forgetting : a swing set seen here in @entity11 's shared backyard in @entity183 is part of life @entity26 hopes to forget this followed a lawsuit from her adoption agency , @entity231			1
the judgement was made even though @entity11 has now vanished to @entity233			2
' i do not believe that i can obtain a fair and unbiased hearing from this court , ' she said in a letter faxed to the court			0
' whether or not ms. @entity11 will ever realise the consequences of her actions remains to be seen , but at least we know now there has a been a ruling by the court that she has been determined to be liable for her actions , ' said @entity244 , attorney for @entity245 , after the hearing			2
the sum that must be paid in support is yet to be fixed , and it is likely to accumulate and go to @entity26 when he is an adult			2
' the irony is if you leave a child in a car with the windows rolled up in a parking lot today , you can be arrested , ' said @entity244			0
' but sending a child 3,000 miles across the @entity258 and there are no consequences for it , that is truly disturbing			0
' at least , though , @entity26 finally has the loving home he so craved .			2

@entity11 adopted @entity26 in 2009 and sent him back to @entity9 in 2010
@entity26 was put a plane to @entity19 alone with a note reading ' mentally unstable ' pinned to his clothing
