a new kind of ‘ @entity2 ’ planet - so - called because of its huge size - has been discovered 560 light years from @entity4 , raising hopes of finding rocky worlds that could sustain life			1
named @entity9 - 10c , the planet is 17 times more massive than our planet , and has been named a ' @entity13 '			1
astronomers did n't believe such a world could exist because they argued anything so large would grab hydrogen gas as it grew and become a gaseous ‘ mini-neptune ’			1
a new kind of ‘ @entity2 ’ planet - dubbed a @entity21 - has been discovered in a distant star system			2
pictured is an artist 's impression of the newly discovered planet , which dominates the foreground			0
its sibling , the lava world @entity29 , is in the background but to their surprise , kepler - 10c has been able to remain solid despite being more than twice as old as the @entity4			1
the discovery suggests that potentially life - bearing rocky planets may be far more common than first thought , and some could be extremely ancient			2
kepler - 10c circles its sun - like parent star , located in the constellation @entity40 , every 45 days			1
the planet has a diameter more than twice that of the @entity4			2
the @entity46 star system is thought to be 11 billion years old , meaning it formed less than three billion years after the birth to the universe			2
it is located about 560 light - years from @entity4 in the constellation @entity40			1
the heavyweight world is up to 17 times more massive than the @entity4 , it has at least one unusual neighbour , @entity9 - 10b - a scorching hot ' lava world ' three times heavier than @entity4 that whips around the star once every 20 hours			1
kepler - 10c is n’t likely to harbour life as it is too close to its parents star			1
gravity at the surface is about twice that of @entity4 ’s gravity			0
the @entity46 star system is thought to be 11 billion years old , meaning it formed less than three billion years after the birth to the universe			2
@entity4 , by comparison , is only around 4.5 billion years old			2
‘ this is the godzilla of @entity4			0
but unlike the movie monster , kepler - 10c has positive implications for life , ’ said dr @entity68 , from the @entity69 for @entity70 ( @entity71 )			1
‘ finding kepler - 10c tells us that rocky planets could form much earlier than we thought			1
and if you can make rocks , you can make life			1

the kepler space telescope orbits around the sun , 40 million miles from @entity4			0
it is named after @entity102 astronomer @entity101			0
the probe launched in 2009 with the mission of finding new planets			0
@entity9 's mission was supposed to be over by now , but last year @entity107 agreed to keep @entity9 running through 2016 at a cost of about £ 13 million ( $ 20 million ) a year			0
according to @entity107 , there is , what 's dubbed , a ' @entity111 ' in space where the temperature is not too hot , or too cold , for water to exist in liquid form			0
any planets found in this zone could have life on them			0
if @entity9 is retired , @entity107 scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered			2
kepler - 10c was originally spotted by @entity107 's @entity9 spacecraft , which finds planets using the transit method , looking for a star that dims when a planet passes in front of it			1
by measuring the dimming , scientists can calculate the planet ’s physical size			0

kepler - 10c , which has a diameter more than twice that of the @entity4 , was previously thought to fall into the category of ' @entity151 ' planets that have an icy core surrounded by a thick gassy envelope			1
but observations made from the @entity156 @entity155 in the @entity157 confirmed that it has 17 times the mass of the @entity4 - far heavier than expected			0
this proved it must be made from dense rocks , like the @entity4			0
' we were very surprised when we realised what we had found , ' said astronomer dr @entity165 , also from the @entity71 , who led the research			0
' kepler - 10c did n’t lose its atmosphere over time			1
it ’s massive enough to have held onto one if it ever had it - it must have formed the way we see it now			0
' @entity71 astronomer @entity175 believe he has found a correlation between the period of a planet - how long it takes to orbit its star - and the size at which a planet transitions from rocky to gaseous			2
this suggests that more mega-earths will be found as planet hunters extend their data to longer - period orbits			0

by measuring the dimming , scientists can calculate the planet ’s physical size the early universe contained only hydrogen and helium			0
heavier elements needed to make rocky planets , such as silicon and iron , had to be created in the first generations of stars			2
when those stars exploded , they scattered the crucial ingredients through space , which then could be incorporated into later generations of stars and planets			0
the process should have taken billions of years , but kepler - 10c shows that the universe was able to form such huge rocks even during the time when heavy elements were scarce			1
professor @entity68 said astronomers should not rule out old stars when they search for @entity4 - like planets			1
and if old stars can host rocky earths too , he said , then we have a better chance of locating potentially habitable worlds in our cosmic neighborhood .			0

the 11 billion - year - old planet is located 560 light years away from @entity4
named @entity9 - 10c , it has remained a rocky world despite being so huge
astronomers *initially* did n't believe such a large , rocky planet could exist
scientists argued that its size would cause it to become a gaseous planet
‘ finding kepler - 10c tells us that rocky planets could form much earlier . and if you can make rocks , you can make life , ' said astronomer @entity68
