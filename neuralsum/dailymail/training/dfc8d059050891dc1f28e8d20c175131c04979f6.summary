the footage , taken from a camera mounted to the rider 's helmet , was uploaded to @entity43 where mr @entity7 commented on the incident			1
an experienced downhill racer , he wrote that he was travelling to fast to avoid the boy and had ' no doubt ' that the child 's helmet saved him from a serious head injury and possibly even death			1
' i have no doubt that the little fella 's helmet saved him some extensive head injuries , and possibly his life , ' he said			2
' the force of that impact , though reduced as best i could , would have easily been enough of a ' king hit ' , if he had not been wearing a helmet i dare say he 'd be in a hospital or worse			2
ï»¿ ' mr @entity7 's @entity43 channel is filled with videos of him riding along similar circuits to the @entity10 bike park , in @entity67 - the track he was riding on when he hit the child			1
he says he is a rider for @entity70 , a brand of mountain bike specifically designed for downhill racing			2

' practice run was going awesome until i got over the top of this blind drop to find a small child standing on the landing , ' he said			0
' unfortunately we both chose the same way to avoid each other , luckily he had a helmet on and was ok			0
gave me a heart attack though ! ' the video was originally uploaded to the social media site @entity100 by user @entity101			0
