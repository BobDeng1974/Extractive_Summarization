by @entity1 reporter published : 05:02 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:14 est , 3 september 2012 a mystery consortium is drawing up plans for a four - runway airport close to @entity6 , it was claimed yesterday			1
the unnamed group of @entity9 businesses has commissioned a ‘ world - leading infrastructure firm ’ to assess potential sites to the west and north of @entity14 which could rival , or even replace , @entity6			1
the claim came as it emerged that @entity16 is to order an independent review of the future of @entity9 ’s airports in a bid to end @entity22 infighting over plans for a third runway at @entity9 ’s only international hub airport			2
hub : the new airport would have four runways and be within easy reach of @entity14 and the midlands expansion : debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at @entity6 demand : it 's feared @entity9 will be left behind without a bigger airport - but campaigners have fiercely fought @entity6 expansion plans the prime minister is hoping the review will secure cross-party support and defuse a row over aviation policy that has split the @entity42			1
the consortium in the latest claims is reported to have opened talks with @entity47 sovereign wealth funds over the financing of the project , which could cost between £ 40billion to £ 60billion			2
transport secretary : @entity51 is preparing to launch a major consultation on future airport expansion it is understood experts have been asked to evaluate tracts of land which could take such a large development , with sites in @entity60 and @entity61 potentially in the frame			1
such a proposal would inevitably face opposition from communities and environmental groups			0
in a chaotic day yesterday senior @entity67 appeared to contradict each other on whether the party might revisit its pledge to rule out a new runway at @entity6			1
@entity72 told the @entity74 ’s @entity73 that the government needed to examine ‘ all options ’ for expanding airport capacity within the @entity78			0
‘ we need more runway capacity in the @entity78 of @entity81 , ’ he said			0
‘ okay , then there ’s a question of where it should go – @entity6 , new estuary airport , @entity86 , @entity87 ? people have lots of different options			1
what i would say is let ’s examine all the options			0
let ’s do it now			0
’ but within an hour foreign secretary @entity97 took to the airwaves to rule out a u-turn on @entity6			1
he told @entity100 : ‘ the circumstances have not changed , it ’s important to stick to that election promise			0
’ the @entity105 ’s leader in @entity106 also weighed in , saying a third runway at @entity6 was essential for both the @entity9 and @entity106			1
@entity108 said : ‘ priorities – and economic landscapes – change			0
in politics , you need to be big enough to change your mind			0
’ last week the senior backbencher @entity115 issued a challenge to mr @entity16 to drop his opposition to expansion at @entity6			2
@entity119 insists the prime minister will not back down over @entity6 , at least until after the 2015 election			2
ministers hope that an independent review will take the political heat out of the situation and force the @entity126 and @entity127 to agree a consensus solution			0
a report yesterday claimed an airport close to the @entity131 might take only two years longer to build than a third runway at @entity6			1
the analysis suggests that plans for a £ 23billion airport on the @entity136 , in @entity137 , could become a reality within 14 years .			0
