by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 15:43 est , 5 march 2014 a gypsy couple have been ordered to demolish the £ 250,000 home they have lived in for eight years , because it is 18 inches too wide			1
@entity6 and partner @entity7 moved onto the land in @entity9 , @entity10 in 2006 but ignored the local planning laws which outlines a ban to build on the site			1
in 2011 - after an appeal - they were eventually granted permission to have two mobile homes which they knocked into a single property , complete with conservatory			1
a gypsy couple have been ordered to demolish the £ 250,000 home they have lived in for eight years , because it is 18 inches too wide but they found themselves in another battle with @entity27 when it emerged their double park home - which has a front garden and an ornamental pond - was too big and did n't adhere to the planning proposal			1
mr @entity6 , 70 , said the battle has already cost him £ 30,000 in planning fees and it would cost him another £ 38,000 to reduce the size of the property in which he and his partner were planning to retire in			2
it comes after planners said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites			0
mr @entity6 , and his partner , 75 , were refused permission to keep the existing home on the site as the council voted for ' direct action ' to remove it in 2012			1
the ' mobile home ' structure is on a plot of rectangular land , settled back from the road			2
planners said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites			0
the plot also has a pond and a front garden the couple appealed but a high court judge has now lifted an injunction stopping the council from getting rid of the property under the original enforcement notice of 2006			1
a report to a recent planning committee meeting said : ' implementation and execution of direct action to comply with part of the enforcement notice , the removal of the unauthorised park home , will now be carried out to remedy the ongoing breach of planning control			0
' mr @entity6 said : ' all i want to do is live here and retire here			0
that 's all i 'm asking			0
' it 's cost me £ 30,000 in solicitor 's fees so far and i 'm not finished yet			0
' he has estimated it would cost him £ 38,000 to reduce the width of the property			0
in 2006 , the council refused to accept that the mobile unit was a ' caravan ' because it did not pass the necessary mobility tests			0
council chiefs also did no believe that mr @entity6 was a gypsy at he beginning of the planning process - so the planning decision was not assessed in accordance with gypsy sites			1
however , after hearing additional information about his formerly ' nomadic life ' - which he lived until he decided to settle down and cease travelling - they accepted his status and gave permission for him to build a ' mobile home for persons of gypsy status ' .			2

@entity6 and @entity7 moved onto land in @entity9 , @entity10 in 2006
but they ignored local planning laws which outlines ban to build on the site
eventually granted permission for two static homes to be knocked through
now council says home , which has pond and garden , is 18 inches too wide
