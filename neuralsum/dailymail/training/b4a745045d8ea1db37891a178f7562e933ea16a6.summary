a fan of weed , comedy , and quality burritos found himself in an awkward situation after mistaking a parody commercial for the real thing and firing off an angry e-mail to @entity8			1
a @entity10 user posting under the screen name ' @entity12 ' recounted the story about how he dozed off while getting high at the wrong time			2
he 'd been watching a new episode of @entity16 , which has been lacing its episodes with jokes about the near future in its final season set in 2017			2
' for some stupid reason i was pissed , ' @entity31 wrote on @entity10			0
' hell , @entity8 just took an item off the menu because of the way they were treating animals , how could they possibly justify teaming up with a company who is destroying the planet ? ! ' he decided to give @entity8 a piece of his mind writing : ' now you 've teamed up with @entity38 , a company who is destroying the planet and laughing about it as they run away from their responsibilities to the environment			1
' luckily for the @entity10 user @entity8 understood his confusion and invited him in anytime luckily his missive found its way to an understanding corporate rep. ' we definitely have n’t partnered with @entity38 , ' the rep responded			1
' the only thing i can find online that might suggest this is a fake commercial that aired on @entity16 recently			0
which is an awesome show as far as i ’m concerned , but i ’m sorry if it caused any confusion ! ' @entity12 , or @entity73 as the posted e-mails reveal his first name , sent off an apology and explanation			0
' @entity79 to have set you straight , @entity73 , ' the amused rep wrote back			0
' the next time the munchies hit , hopefully you can head for @entity8 and fell good about where your money is going			1

@entity86 ' woke up right in the middle of an ad that seemed to be touting a merger between the upscale @entity36 chain and fossil fuel behemoth @entity38
had been *smoking* *marijuana* and dozed off during @entity16 episode
amused @entity8 rep *forgave* the mistake and told @entity12 to come into a *restaurant* if the munchies hit
