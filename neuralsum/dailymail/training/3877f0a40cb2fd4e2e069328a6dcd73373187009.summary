@entity0 may have slipped from the summit of @entity3 football but this tie proved that @entity5 are still stranded half - way down the mountain			1
the @entity8 giants arrived in @entity9 on the back of a shock defeat to @entity12 on saturday that left them four points behind @entity15 at the top of @entity17			0
and they were besieged by controversy about @entity21 ’s visit to a casino in the early hours of monday morning with team - mate @entity23			1
@entity24 fired home from a tight angle after outwitting @entity27 to put @entity0 ahead @entity24 ( left ) finishes off a lovely move from a tight angle to give @entity5 a mountain to climb the @entity5 defence can only look back in anger after @entity24 hit his second of the game to stun the hosts but @entity5 soothed all their visitors ' uncertainties away with a performance that was timid , insipid and ineffective			1
@entity5 were , quite simply , the dream opponents , supine and dull			2
@entity0 strolled through the first half as if it were a practice match			1
it felt as if they could not quite believe their luck			0
this is the kind of result and performance that could act as a catalyst for @entity0 as they try to reclaim their crown , at home and abroad			2
for a side that frets about its @entity54 , this was a performance that suggested @entity0 are more than a one - man team			1
the old @entity57 of @entity21 , @entity58 and @entity59 is no more			2
@entity58 was on the bench and there are doubts about the longevity of @entity59			0
but even though @entity21 was sublime , there were signs a new @entity57 is emerging			2
@entity66 , @entity5 's saviour in the group stages , gave his side a glimmer of home with this sublime effort the @entity73 striker was his bustling , energetic best giving @entity75 little chance @entity66 breathed life into the tie with his 69th minute strike pegging back an irresistible @entity0 so far , @entity24 has been content to play a supporting role to @entity21 and feed the @entity73 ’s goalscoring genius			1
those close to the team say @entity24 has made a conscious decision to sacrifice individual glory in the pursuit of the trophies that have largely eluded him			2
@entity24 knows that making sure @entity21 is functioning at his peak represents the team 's best chance of being successful and he has resolved to do everything he can to assist him			1
it is one of the reasons why @entity24 and @entity21 , who does not like to share the scoring spoils , get on so well			1
but on his first return to @entity97 since his £ 75million move from @entity99 in the summer , @entity24 showed the match - winning talent that was his trademark during his time on @entity103			1
@entity104 saves @entity21 's spot kick to hand @entity5 a @entity107 lifeline time stands still as @entity21 throws himself at the rebound , but his diving header goes wide of the post @entity113 ’s 4 - 4 - 2 system played into @entity0 ’s hands by leaving @entity5 hopelessly outnumbered in central midfield where @entity0 literally ran rings around them			1
that was @entity0 ’s foundation but it was @entity24 , @entity21 and @entity121 who ripped @entity5 ’s defence to shreds			1
@entity0 ’s front three were a joy to watch			2
@entity21 , listless and ineffective against @entity12 , was back to his dazzling , dribbling , mesmerising best			1
it was his curling cross that flummoxed @entity27 after 16 minutes and allowed @entity24 to rifle in the rebound			1
and it was his beautiful run across the face of @entity5 ’s box and his lay - off to @entity132 that allowed @entity134 to curl a cross into the path of @entity24 that the @entity137 touched home			1
the maddening thing for @entity5 and their fans was that this was an opportunity missed			2
@entity144 's reckless tackle on @entity145 was rewarded with a second yellow of the night and an early bath @entity104 and @entity21 share a light - hearted moment during a tense @entity107 encounter @entity0 are still a fine , fine side , of course			1
the fact that they had won 11 straight games before that defeat to @entity12 tells you that			0
but they are vulnerable , too			0
or they would have been if @entity5 had offered any type of threat			2
there was a reason why @entity21 ’s casino visit caused a furore			0
there was a reason why the issue poisoned @entity0 coach @entity169 ’s press conference here on monday night			0
a few seasons ago , when @entity0 were sweeping all before them , the casino visit would have been ignored			0
but things are different now			0
their dominance has gone and so has the confidence of their fans			0
they find more reasons to fret			0
@entity24 's two - goal salvo silenced the @entity183 and left @entity5 's @entity107 hopes hanging by a thread @entity27 was at fault for the first and the @entity5 captain trudges ruefully to the half - way line @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 cut dejected figures after @entity24 's second of the night so after the defeat to @entity12 on saturday afternoon , the casino visit felt like a symbol of a team whose focus has slipped			1
and the @entity0 team that walked out on to the pitch at the @entity183 was a team that has lost its assumptions of superiority			0
it is a team in transition			0
some say it is at the beginning of a new cycle			0
some argue it has not yet ended the old one			0
against that backdrop , it turned out that a visit to the @entity183 was exactly what @entity0 needed			0
it was the perfect tonic			0
by midway through the second half , most @entity5 fans were resigned to their team ’s fate			2
@entity121 was a nuisance and is pictured giving @entity220 a run for his money @entity21 was also outstanding and is manhandled by @entity223 with @entity27 and @entity189 looking on they gasped in awe when @entity21 took down a high ball that was falling over his shoulder and killed it stone dead			0
@entity5 forced their way back into the game with a goal from @entity66 20 minutes from time but that was largely because @entity0 had taken their foot off the pedal			1
when they pressed back down on it , @entity5 were chasing shadows again and would have gone further behind if @entity21 had converted either his injury time penalty or the rebound that he headed wide			1
it felt like we were turning back time to when @entity0 were revered as the kings of beautiful football , the epitome of everything that is good in the game			2
it was a time to sit back and marvel .			0

@entity113 named an attacking line - up and his *selection* was *punished*
his 4 - 4 - 2 system played into @entity0 's hands by leaving @entity5 hopelessly outnumbered in central midfield
@entity24 struck twice in the first half hour to give @entity0 control
@entity66 hit back in the 69th minute to give @entity5 a @entity107 lifeline
@entity144 was sent off for a rash *challenge* on @entity145
@entity104 saved @entity21 's last - gasp penalty and the @entity73 missed the rebound with a diving header
