the @entity1 ’s new secret superspy plane is flying in the airspace above @entity3 and will likely be ready for missions by 2015			1
the large , classified unmanned @entity6 - 180 , developed by @entity7 , is designed for intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( @entity11 ) missions			1
the secret unmanned aerial system ( @entity13 ) , funded through the @entity1 ’s classified budget , was awarded to @entity7 after a competition that included @entity16 and @entity17			1
stealth in the sky : the @entity1 's new secret superspy plane , the @entity21 , is flying in the airspace above @entity3 and will likely be ready for missions by 2015			1
this is an artist rendering of what it will look like the aircraft will conduct intelligence missions that have been left unaddressed , and under wide debate , since the retirement of the @entity30 in 1998 , according to @entity31			0
it is also set to take the place of @entity17 's @entity34 , which was the plane used in the operation that killed @entity37			1
although the new plane is top secret and details of it have yet to be released , it is definitely very big			0
publicly available overhead imagery shows that new hangars at @entity7 's @entity45 , @entity46 , site and at the @entity1 's @entity3 test center in @entity3 , @entity48 , have been built to hold an aircraft with a wing span of more than 130 feet			1
this makes it much bigger than the @entity34 , which has an estimated wingspan of between 65 feet and 90 feet			0
the @entity21 carries radio - frequency sensors such as active , electronically scanned array ( @entity56 ) radar and passive electronic surveillance measures , according to @entity31			0
it could also be capable of electronic attack missions			0
@entity3 : a dirt road that leads to the restricted @entity3			0
the stealth plane is reportedly flying over this area already as the @entity1 is making trial runs top secret : the classified unmanned @entity21 , developed by @entity7 , is designed for intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( @entity11 ) missions			1
it is being tested over @entity3 , pictured , at the moment the @entity1 nor @entity7 have wished to comment on the classified airplane			2
@entity1 spokeswoman @entity71 said that the @entity1 ‘ does not discuss this program ’			0
this aircraft ’s design is key for the shift of @entity11 assets away from ‘ permissive ’ environments - such as @entity78 and @entity79 , where @entity7 ’s non-stealthy @entity81 and @entity80 operate - and toward operations in ‘ contested ’ or ‘ denied ’ airspace , according to @entity31			2

the @entity21 eclipses the smaller , less stealthy and shorter - range @entity34			2
the plane will be another to the growing fleet manufactured by @entity7			0
the latest was the @entity97 unmanned aircraft system which completed its first flight from the @entity7 manufacturing facility in @entity45 on may 22			2
the 80 - minute flight successfully demonstrated control systems that allow @entity97 to operate autonomously			0
@entity97 is designed to fly surveillance missions up to 24 - hours at altitudes of more than 10 miles , allowing coverage out to 2,000 nautical miles			0
@entity105 of @entity13 planes : the @entity97 unmanned aircraft system is shown completing its first flight from the @entity7 manufacturing facility in @entity45 , @entity46 , in may if the previous patterns for secret @entity11 aircraft operations are followed for the @entity21 , the new @entity13 will be jointly controlled by the @entity1 and the @entity110			1
this arrangement has been used for the @entity34 , which is operated by the @entity1 ’s 30th @entity112 , according to a fact sheet the @entity1 released after one of the aircraft turned up in @entity116 in december 2011			1
the @entity116 proudly displayed on state television a stealthy @entity119 unmanned aircraft it claimed it had downed while conducting reconnaissance overflights , which turned out to be the @entity34			2
@entity7 ’s financial reports point to a possible award of a secret @entity13 contract in 2008 , when the company disclosed a $ 2 billion increase in the backlog in its @entity129 , said @entity31			2
this year , @entity7 financial reports acknowledged that an unnamed aircraft program entered low - rate initial production , the @entity134 term for low - volume deliveries that begin as testing and near completion , and before the program is approved for full production .			0
