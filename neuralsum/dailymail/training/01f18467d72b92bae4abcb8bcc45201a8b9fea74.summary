@entity0 chairs the all - party group which has suggested a range of measures to help to free up more than 4 million family homes			1
stamp duty should be waived for millions of pensioners to encourage them to downsize , a group of mps said last night			1
they quote analysis that found a third of over- 60s want to move into smaller houses – but are put off because of the large amount they have to pay in tax			1
it means they are forced to continue to live in family - sized homes which are far bigger than they need , and which are expensive to heat			1
the all - party parliamentary group on housing and care for older people said the answer was to exempt them from stamp duty on homes worth £ 250,000 or less			1
they could then move into smaller homes more appropriate to their needs – freeing up their larger houses for families who need more room			1
the help to move idea is contained in a report by the all - party group , which is chaired by @entity0 , the former head of the @entity42			1
it suggests a range of measures to help to free up more than 4 million family homes			1
‘ more and more people in their “ extended middle age ” are thinking about downsizing , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ this can mean much reduced fuel bills and maintenance costs , perhaps the release of some capital , and can prevent a forced move in later life			2
‘ our report recommends a help to move package of stamp duty relief , financial advice and mortgage support – like the help to buy assistance for younger purchasers – to generate the demand that will get more high - quality homes built for this age group			1
a third of over- 60s specifically wanted to downsize , while a quarter said they were interested in buying a retirement property			1
the mps say exempting older people from stamp duty on homes worth up to £ 250,000 would lead to a net gain to the @entity86 because of the consequent moves in the property market			1
the report also calls for loans for older homeowners with lower value properties to allow them to get mortgages to buy higher - value retirement homes			2
@entity96 found a third of over- 60s want to move into smaller houses , but are put off because of the large amount they have to pay in tax - forcing them to continue to live in family - sized homes which are far bigger than they need and are expensive to heat at present , many older people can not access mainstream mortgage lending			1
the report said a scheme like @entity63 to buy , which helps younger people get on the housing ladder , could help pensioners at the other end of their lives			0
@entity115 , chief executive of the think tank demos and author of the report , said : ‘ politicians from all parties are committed to helping first time buyers get onto the housing ladder , while ignoring the problems at the other end of the market			0
‘ many older people would like to downsize and are stuck in properties that are hard to manage and heat			0
‘ a lack of suitable properties and the practical and emotional upheaval of moving ca n’t be underestimated – but affordability is a major barrier for many			0
‘ the government needs to commit to really helping this group of people with concrete policies – not just to ensure older people enjoy a better quality of life but also to stimulate their entire housing market by helping more older people move from family - sized homes			1
’ while some homeowners are lucky enough to be mortgage free , many people in their 50s will still have a home loan			2
