by @entity1 reporter published : 10:16 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 22 september 2012 patients endured ‘ completely unacceptable ’ conditions when they were forced to stay in a hospital ’s day - surgery ward for up to four days because of @entity7 bed shortages			1
with no showers on the ward , they had to clean themselves in disposable cardboard wash bowls filled with water			0
and because there were no proper catering facilities , they were given sandwiches and frozen ready meals heated in a microwave instead of freshly prepared food			0
@entity20 : legal restriction to stop it from keeping patients in the surgical day unit for more than 23 hours patients on the ward also had to leave their belongings on the floor because there were no bedside cupboards			1
the failings were discovered at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , by @entity35 inspectors			1
to ensure the ‘ safety and wellbeing ’ of patients , the watchdog body has now banned the hospital from keeping them on the day - surgery ward for more than 24 hours			1
patients on the day unit did not receive freshly cooked meals for days and washed in disposable bowls the disposable cardboard wash bowls they were required to use are favoured by @entity7 staff over plastic ones as there is a lower risk of infections being spread between patients			1
due to a clause in the hospital ’s catering contract , it can not provide patients with hot food from the kitchen on the day - surgery ward			2
@entity60 , interim chief executive of the trust , said : ' we do accept that the facilities and environment on this unit were not entirely suitable for inpatients ' patients were only meant to stay in the unit for up to 24 hours before being discharged or transferred to another ward , but some had to remain there for four days			1
@entity71 , deputy director of the @entity35 in the @entity72 , said : ‘ the failings we witnessed on this unit at @entity31 were completely unacceptable			2
‘ the @entity35 took swift action following our inspection to ensure the safety and wellbeing of patients			2
‘ the decision to place an urgent condition on a provider ’s registration is not one we take lightly			0
however , when we find poor practice , as we did in this case , we will take immediate action to ensure patients are not at risk			0
’ the hospital will now have to prove to the watchdog that it has made substantial improvements and may face further inspections			0
patients staying in the ward had all undergone day surgery including having hernias removed , varicose vein treatment or dental operations			2
most having such procedures are allowed to go home on the same day , but some have to stay on after developing complications or taking longer to recover			0
@entity104 , @entity105 ’s shadow public health minister , said : ‘ the failings here are totally unacceptable , and it ’s a real concern that incidents like this seem to be becoming increasingly commonplace because of the strain the @entity7 has been put under			0

inspectors found there was no night lighting on the wards so *bright* lights were *switched* on when needed , *disturbing* sleep of other patients
no bedside *storage* so patients belongings were left on the floor
@entity35 has *imposed* restriction on @entity125 to stop it treating long - term patients on day unit for more than 23 hours
trust interim chief said they accepted facilities were not ' entirely suitable '
