whether or not you choose to drink in front of them , however , is up to you			0
but by doing so could you be setting a dangerous example , and setting them up for a troublesome relationship with the sauce as adults ? two mothers appeared today on @entity22 's @entity21 to debate the issue , with journalist @entity24 maintaining that enjoying a glass of wine over dinner with her husband sets her children a beneficial example , while writer @entity31 stressed that children who see everyday drinking as normal will use that as their life model			1
this has lead to prominent alcohol education charity @entity59 beseeching parents to have the ' alcohol chat ' with their children before it 's too late			1
speaking to @entity64 and @entity65 , mother - of - four @entity24 said : ' my children - the eldest of whom is almost 15 - see me drinking a glass of wine in the evening - with my husband , with food - to relax			1
' they see it in moderation			0
they do n't see me drunk or staggering			0
' it 's naive to think children are n't going to come across alcohol when they leave home , and it 's safer for them to learn about it here with me rather than by binge drinking at university			1
' big debate : @entity65 and @entity64 watch @entity24 and @entity31 discussing the issue on @entity22 's @entity21 today @entity31 said : ' it 's hard to disagree with this , but we 're talking about the more extreme things			1
of course it 's a good idea for children to see parents having a good relationship with alcohol , the problem is when it 's every day , when wine is on the table every night at dinner			1
' health professionals say we should stop daily drinking and make that clear to children from the ages of 0 to 10			2
instead of " when @entity105 's tired she has a drink "			0
' you see it on @entity109 - " 5 o'clock : wine o'clock " - 5 o'clock should n't be wine o'clock ! it should be make the kids tea o'clock , or go for a walk o'clock , or go to the gym o'clock			0
' drinking alcohol should not be an everyday thing			2
' heated : @entity24 , left , said she did n't want to feel guilty for enjoying wine with dinner , but @entity31 , right , said children learn by example learning young : @entity31 suggested that children aged 0 - 10 should be shielded from alcohol to learn that you do n't need to drink it @entity24 counteracted the argument explaining daily drinking is part of @entity130 culture and also done in the @entity131			1
she reiterated that she 'd rather alcohol was n't a hidden topic , but discussed openly within her family so her children were less likely to rebel later on			2
' i will give my kids a drink before they go to university - half a beer or a glasss of wine - so hey can understand the effect alcohol has on their bodies			0
' i have alcoholism in my family and so my kids have seen the negative effects it can have			0
seeimg me drinking one glass of wine in the evening is not the same			0
i object to the guilt trip mothers are when they have a glass of wine at the end of a stressful day			0
' @entity31 , who admitted having bought her 15 - year - old a bottle of beer when she took her to the @entity158 , said it was precisely that language that caused the problem , leading children to believe that the solution to feeling stressed , tired or even hungry is at the bottom of a bottle .			1
