‘ a substantial number of purchasers are likely to [ have been ] deceived into buying [ the ] t - shirt because of a false belief that it has been authorised by @entity2 , ’ he said			1
the judge said it was damaging to her goodwill and represented a loss of control over her reputation in the ‘ fashion sphere ’			2
damages will be decided later			0
the legal case against @entity4 has come as a surprise to some , given @entity2 ’s apparent friendship with @entity4 tycoon sir @entity15			1
big win : @entity2 in @entity52 , @entity53 , on tuesday night after eating in an @entity55 restaurant on the eve of her court victory in @entity27 yesterday decision : justice @entity25 sitting at the @entity26 said @entity4 's sale of a @entity2 t - shirt at the centre of the dispute was an act of ' passing off ' the what ’s my name singer dined with the businessman and music mogul @entity68 during her @entity70 break in @entity71 in 2010			1
she later tweeted : ‘ just had dinner w / @entity68 @entity15 @ @entity73 ! great night ! ’ @entity2 has also spent time with sir @entity15 ’s daughter @entity75 when they were on holiday at the same time in the @entity78 two years ago			2

@entity4 has in the past released a t - shirt featuring a picture of @entity2 taken from the video for her hit @entity88 , which sold out quickly			1

dinner pals : @entity2 having a meal with sir @entity15 and friends in @entity71 on @entity106 2010 chat : sir @entity15 's daughter @entity75 sits with @entity2 on @entity71 over christmas 2011 claims : @entity4 was selling a t - shirt emblazoned with a picture of @entity2 's face she claims is ' very similar ' to one of her album covers @entity115 driver @entity114 successfully sued @entity116 over its use of a photo of him in an advert which suggested he endorsed the radio station celebrities can not easily exert control over the use of their face but @entity2 's victory might encourage more to try , an expert has said			1
the singer successfully sued @entity4 because she was able to convince the court it had created the impression the t - shirts had been endorsed by her			1
@entity132 , head of the intellectual property team at @entity27 law firm @entity134 , said : ' a number of fans would have mistakenly believed she had entered into a commercial deal with the company to sell the clothing			2
' although it is fashionable to talk about image rights , there is in fact no such legal right in existence under @entity147 law			0
' in other words , celebrities , sports personalities , film stars ( or anyone else ) can not exert general control over the use of their likenesses			0
' they can only act to prevent the unauthorised use of their image in a particular case if the type falls within another area of law that does provide protection			0
' examples are where they can use copyright law , the law of privacy or , as in the @entity2 case , " passing off " '			0
' there must be a misrepresentation to the public that there has been a commercial link - up between the celebrity and the person selling or making that t - shirt			0
' people were more likely to think that such a garment must have been licensed or endorsed by the celebrity in question			0
' a number of fans would have mistakenly believed she had entered into a commercial deal with the company to sell the clothing ' @entity132 , @entity188 law firm ' the photo was also similar to one of her album covers and this again suggested an " official " use rather than that the t - shirt was simply an independent work of fashion			0
' it is not the first time a celebrity has successfully sued in this way			0
@entity115 driver @entity114 successfully sued @entity116 over its use of a photo of him in an advert which suggested he endorsed the radio station			0
mr @entity132 said : ' the fact the judge was persuaded to find in @entity2 's favour may give some encouragement to other celebrities			1
' this does not look to me to have been as clear a case as the @entity114 one was			0
' @entity4 clearly decided to run the case on the principle that they could use the @entity2 image in this way			1
' it turns out they could not			0
but this looks to have been a decision that could have gone either way			0

@entity225 said it could harm reputation with fans who think it 's ' *approved* '
@entity4 said they *'d* bought licence for image - taken from music video
retailer says @entity2 's team requested clothes after writ was issued
but high court judge @entity25 found in the @entity244 singer 's favour
' surprised , *perplexed* and *confused* ' @entity4 says it intends to appeal
