by @entity0 forget a slim waist , great legs or glowing skin , the one thing that i have always coveted most in other women is smooth , shiny hair			1
at 44 , i have spent most of my life battling my thick , frizzy mane — hair that , left to its own devices , would grow upwards and outwards , instead of down			1
i can still recall the blow - dry that changed my life : it was 1982 , i was 13 and blissfully unaware that i had the bad hair gene			1
but that afternoon , my hairdresser produced a paddle brush and proceeded to blow - dry my hair straight			1
as shiny , smooth tendrils suddenly skimmed my collarbones , i had an epiphany : for the first time , i felt pretty			1
from frizzy to fabulous : @entity0 now has the sleek hair she 's always yearned for ever since , i have devoted time and money to recreate that feeling , spending 90 minutes ( though that time has more than halved ) blow - drying my hair straight			1
i was convinced — still am — that people take me less seriously with my natural all - over - the - place curls , and when i have sleek hair , i exude a calmer , confident allure			1
what makes hair frizzy ? blame it partly on family , partly on environment			1
mine was inherited from my coarse - haired @entity39 parents , and doubles in size in humidity and damp weather			2
i ’ve been known to leave the house in a beanie hat , even in summer			0
‘ even if hair has been blow - dried , as soon as moisture enters cuticles , the outermost layer , strands behave as they would naturally — in your case , twisting instead of lying straight , ’ says trichologist @entity45			1
‘ there ’s no cure for frizz , you can only use products to calm it			0
’ believe me , over the past 31 years , i have tried every treatment and product			1
some may not be cheap , others may not be easy , but as anyone with the frizzy gene will know , if they work , it ’s worth it			0
natural look : @entity0 aged 12 i once left a salon looking like @entity68 it from the @entity70 after a stylist said ‘ all one length ’ would help my hair drop ( it did n’t )			1
another time , i emerged with more flicky - out layers than @entity76 , and once , i went for a blunt fringe that left me looking like one of @entity79 i met @entity80 at @entity81 in @entity83 ’s @entity82			1
he gently , and i mean gently , layered my hair in a way that thinned out all thickness , letting it fall evenly			0
‘ ask your hairdresser for long , soft layers with volume at the bottom , ’ he says			0
‘ tell them to cut texture in to combat “ poofiness ” , leaving layers with gentle movement			0
’ @entity100 , cheap shampoos add to frizz , making hair coarser by upsetting the lay of the cuticle			0
look for products free from sulphates , harsh detergents that make hair brittle and stiff			0
the best i have used is @entity111 ’s @entity110 range , ( shampoo , £ 13.86 ; conditioner £ 17.85 ) , which also protects hair from frizz - aggravating uv damage			1
if i could take one hair product to a deserted island , it would be bumble and @entity118 , ( £ 16 )			0
even when my hair is due a cut , a few sprays of this when it ’s wet will smooth instantly			2
menthol and peppermint extracts prevent roots getting oily and it ’s alcohol - free : great news , as alcohol increases frizz			0
@entity130 burst on the scene to cult status about ten years ago			0
argan oil is its best - known ingredient , but it also contains silicone polymers which calm frizz and protect from humidity			0
i apply it to towel - dried hair			2
i never use it on dry hair as it makes it greasy			2
bad hair gene : @entity0 , ( aged 19 ) would spend up to 90 minutes trying to tame her curls i discovered @entity146 ( £ 17.90 ) on a trip away with a sleek - haired friend who i would never have guessed was prone to frizz , till i saw her post-swim			1
a touch of this balm and her hair dried naturally into soft curls			2
too much will weigh hair down			0
it 's expensive , but as a finisher on dry hair , nothing beats @entity163 ’s @entity162 ( £ 21.20 )			1
in the same way a @entity167 face cream evens out skin , this smooths flyaways and helps stop the puffy ‘ helmet effect ’ my blow - dry gets on humid days			1
i worship the paddle brush as it creates soft , breezy , straight hair			1
the standard is available from most brush shops , but i recently discovered the @entity175 ( £ 10.20 )			0
the natural bristles are thick and hard , gripping hair for faster blow - dries , leaving a silkier result			1
i ’m not a fan of straightening irons , as i find results short - lived , leaving hair straw - like			2
but i am a fan of ionic hair - dryers , as they emit negative ions which help the cuticle lie flat , giving that glossy effect			2
they cause water in wet hair to break down faster			0
celebrity hairdresser @entity193 ’s @entity192 ( £ 59.99 ) cut my straightening time from 25 to 15 minutes			2
coarse hair can often look dull from too much heat and product overload			0
my antidote is @entity199 ’s @entity198 ( £ 3.49 ) , which adds gloss without weight			0
i stole the secret for this cheap beauty find from a make - up artist who not only uses it to spruce up coarse hair , but also to give skin a moisturised and radiant look			2
i feel pretty ! after 31 years of searching @entity0 has found her frizzy hair 's holy grail @entity211 blow - dries , in which a straightening solution is painted on hair , have been hailed as the ultimate anti-frizz remedy			1
they are controversial as their active ingredient formaldehyde ( used in embalming ) , can be carcinogenic if inhaled in large quantities			0
but i discovered a formaldehyde - free alternative — the @entity222 — at @entity223 , a top salon at @entity225 in @entity83			0
the £ 220 treatment uses a solution with natural keratin ( the protein hair is made of ) and glycolic acid ( used in skincare )			2
@entity232 found it reduces frizz as it penetrates hair shafts and rebuilds keratin semi-permanently			2
stylist @entity235 promises it will leave 70 per cent wave , but remove 100 per cent frizz			0
my hair was washed twice then blow - dried about 80 per cent dry , before being coated in a thick , white substance			1
it was left for 20 minutes then blow - dried , with the product in , before a once over with a straightening iron			1
the result was straight locks , which i was told not to ‘ dent ’ or wet for three days			0
by day three , my hair was so greasy , i could n’t go out			0
but on the fourth , i shampooed and let my hair dry naturally : it dried with a gentle wave , and zero frizz			2
my picture for this piece was taken that day			0
since then i have been caught in rain , sweated in the gym and not had to blow - dry my hair or go near it with a straightening iron			1
my hair is swishy and shiny with no effort , save a little towel - drying			1
best of all , the effects should last around five months			0
after 30 years of searching , i ’ve found my frizzy hair ’s holy grail .			1
