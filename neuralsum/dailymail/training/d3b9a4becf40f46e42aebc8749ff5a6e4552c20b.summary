climate change experts have been trying for years to explain why the sea ice in @entity2 is expanding			1
now scientists claim to have found the answer – global warming			0
they believe the paradoxical shift is caused by water melting from beneath the @entity2 ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface			1
a pod of orcas amongst the breaking sea ice , @entity13 , @entity2 2009			1
researchers now believe the ice is increasing the frozen sea around the @entity17 has been steadily growing , reaching a record extent in the winter of 2010 , while the @entity21 ice at the north of the planet shrank to a record low last year			1
now a team from the respected @entity26 says that the fresh water melting from the @entity2 ice sheets has a relatively low density compared to the denser salty seawater , so it accumulates in the top layer of the ocean during the summer months			1
the surface waters re-freeze during autumn and winter to spread across a greater area			0
the @entity36 study , published yesterday in the journal @entity38 , says : ‘ @entity39 around @entity2 is increasing despite the warming global climate			2
this is caused by melting of the ice sheets from below			2
this powerful negative feedback counteracts @entity46 atmospheric warming			0
’ september 26 , 2012 , when ice covered more of the @entity48 than at any other time in the satellite record			0
the researchers predict the phenomenon will continue			0
the @entity54 ’s poles have very different geography			0
surrounded by @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , the @entity21 ice cap floats on the ocean , not land			2
it has lost a large amount of its older , thicker sea ice over the last 30 years , making it more vulnerable to the warming trend			0
the @entity2 , however , is a continent circled by open waters that lets sea ice expand during the winter but also offers less shelter during the melt season			1
the @entity36 report notes that despite the increase in surface ice expansion each winter , the total mass of ice around @entity2 is continuing to shrink because of the underwater ice melt			1
the study is not the first to put forward a reason for the @entity2 effect			2
however , there is some scepticism about the findings			0
the @entity85 and @entity86 believe wind in behind the rise in ice levels in the @entity2 @entity90 of the @entity85 stuck to his findings in a report last year that a shift in winds linked to climate change was blowing a layer of meltwater further out to sea and adding to winter ice			1
‘ the possibility remains that the real increase is the sum of wind - driven and meltwater - driven effects , of course			0
that would be my best guess , with the meltwater effect being the smaller of the two , ’ he said			0
the @entity36 report also speculated that a cold layer of water created offshore may be responsible for lower than average snowfall in @entity2 , as it cools the air above it			2
cold air can hold less moisture than warm			0
‘ @entity116 sea surface temperatures around @entity2 could offset projected snowfall increases in @entity2 , with implications for estimates of future sea - level rise , ’ said the study			1
at a winter maximum in september , ice on the sea around @entity2 covers about 7.3million square miles , bigger than @entity2 ’s land area			1
the scientists say the @entity2 sea ice has shown a small but significant growth of 1.9 per cent per decade since 1985 .			2
