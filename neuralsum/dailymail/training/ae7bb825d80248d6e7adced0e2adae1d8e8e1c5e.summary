prince @entity0 is said to be furious at being relegated to a walk - on bit part in the family			0
@entity3 is exasperated that his wife @entity4 is no longer the @entity6 ’s favourite			1
but one of the royals is overwhelmed by relief as crowds continue to swarm around @entity11 , @entity12 and baby @entity13 on their tour @entity15			1
as she enters the tenth year of her marriage to the @entity0 , the former mrs @entity20 ‘ could n’t be happier to see @entity18 taking all the limelight ’ , says one of her ­ closest friends			1
the @entity6 is said to have grown fond of the @entity24 and has been impressed by her ' un-showy ' way for she knows that it deflects attention from what many now see as her remorseless progress towards becoming @entity6 @entity30 alongside @entity31			1
carefully laid state plans currently rule this out , of course , and she has to settle for being called @entity35			0
but she has triumphed before			0
she was said to have had no wish to destroy princess @entity38 ’s marriage to @entity31 — yet it was destroyed			0
she felt no need to be more than prince @entity31 ’s ­ mistress as long as she had him to herself — yet she married him			0
she had no desire for the unnecessary trappings of a royal title — yet these days we know her as @entity46 the @entity24			0
she never expected to be mentioned alongside the @entity6 , prince @entity47 and @entity31 in sunday prayers for the @entity49 in churches , yet this is under discussion			1
oh yes , and for years friends have said she has no wish to be @entity6			1
of course , the driving force behind her inexorable royal progress is prince @entity31			0
and who could doubt the success of his softly - softly strategy as @entity30 took her place at the ­ historic @entity62 for the ­ president of @entity64 last week			1
she looked for all the world like a @entity6 - in - waiting — her carefully dyed fair hair swept up and crowned with the @entity68 ’s favourite , glittering @entity70 tiara			1
she sat graciously at the heart of matters , on the right of diminutive @entity64 president @entity74 , while the @entity6 was on his left			1
the @entity76 and @entity12 along with @entity77 are seeing a surge in popularity as they continue their @entity81 tour today , it would seem churlish for anyone in royal circles to harbour resentment against a woman who is approaching her 67th birthday in july and who has , quite obviously , settled comfortably into the public role that arrived late in life			1
but friends and admirers of @entity38 continue to find the ease with which @entity30 has been welcomed into royal life as the @entity96 ’s replacement very hard to swallow			1
it will be even harder for them to learn that the @entity6 herself — who once memorably dubbed @entity30 ‘ that wicked woman ’ — is understood now to ‘ genuinely like her ’			1
‘ why should anyone be surprised ? ’ says one of @entity30 ’s circle			1
‘ they have a lot in common , after all			1
they love horses and the countryside			0
‘ and the @entity6 has been impressed with @entity30 ’s un-showy way of going about her duties			1
just like the @entity6 herself , @entity30 does n’t like grand appearances for their own sake and does n’t have to be competitive like the rest of the family			1
’ though @entity30 was divorced from her first husband , the security of her position ironically owes much to the @entity6 ’s own happy marriage and belief that it has taken two ­ people to create the brilliant success of her reign			1
the @entity6 thinks that , for @entity31 to be a successful ­ monarch , he will need someone to support him as @entity47 has done so wonderfully over six decades			1
timing , they say , is everything , and @entity30 was conveniently at the @entity0 ’s side as the @entity6 noticeably began scaling back her role last year following the triumphant , but tiring , @entity127			1
@entity128 looked very much at home sitting with @entity31 on two mini-thrones alongside the @entity6 and @entity47 at the @entity131 last may			1
and in november when , for the first time , @entity31 represented the @entity6 , who will be 88 on monday , welcoming @entity134 heads of government at their get - together in @entity137			1
so just what is it that gives @entity30 such confidence ? after all , she knows that many still blame her for destroying @entity38 ’s marriage			1
the answer may come as a ­ surprise			0
according to one of her closest friends : ‘ @entity30 knows the @entity6 is now depending on her			1
’ this is an extraordinary turn of events			0
not so many years ago , the @entity6 feared that @entity31 ’s mistress was putting the throne in jeopardy			2
so anxious was she about the public ’s reaction to the prince marrying @entity30 , that she distanced herself from the ceremony at @entity157 in april 2005 , only attending the blessing afterwards			2
yet last week the couple sailed through their ninth wedding anniversary apparently without a care in the world			0
‘ @entity30 ’s value to the @entity6 lies in her ability to manage @entity31 ’s moods and frustrations , ’ explains a palace aid			1
@entity4 , the @entity4 was said to be the @entity6 's favourite daughter - in - law she performs the key function of ‘ propping up ’ the man who has been heir to the throne for a record 62 years as he goes through what an aide describes as ‘ one of his ­ periodic bouts of gloom over where he is heading ’			1
‘ at such times , ’ says the aide , ‘ the @entity0 feels he is an insignificant figure trapped between an immensely popular monarch and a glamorous young couple			0
only @entity30 is capable of bringing him out of these glooms			2
’ after the @entity187 in 2012 , @entity31 established an ‘ understanding ’ with his aged parents giving him special responsibilities to ­ fashion the monarchy in his own way when he accedes			0
‘ despite this , he still has a habit of periodically becoming preoccupied with being the longest - running understudy in history , ’ says one close figure			0
‘ and it does n’t help him that the world ’s attention on , and fascination with , @entity11 , @entity12 and baby @entity13 is growing by the day as crowds swarm around them @entity205			2
‘ i do n’t know how he would have coped without @entity30			2
it ’s probably why he needed her as his ­ mistress for all those years			0
she knows how to keep him going			0
’ little wonder the @entity6 wants her mentioned in @entity209 prayers			2
not everyone , however , is as enthusiastic about the changing pecking order in @entity212			0
the break - up of @entity31 ’s marriage to @entity38 , and prince @entity0 ’s with @entity215 , meant that for several years prince @entity3 ’s wife , former public relations girl @entity4 — the @entity4 — was the royal woman next in line of precedence to the @entity6			2
out of her daughters - in - law , @entity4 is her favourite			0
‘ @entity4 had a taste of being the woman next in line to the @entity6 and quite liked it , ’ says one who has observed her at close quarters			2
‘ then @entity30 married @entity31 , pushing her down a notch , and after this @entity12 arrived as @entity12 , pushing her down the list even further			1
the @entity6 and the @entity24 attend the @entity228 service together ‘ she does n’t like it			2
@entity230 knows how she ’ll react if @entity0 ever gets round to remarrying @entity215			0
’ @entity30 has no such worries			2
as the wife of the @entity0 , her position as second only to the @entity6 is unassailable			2
‘ she lets people think this sort of thing matters not a jot to her , ’ says an aide , ‘ but the truth is , attention is addictive			0
everyone in the @entity49 likes the limelight			0
’ brotherly harmony has been replaced by bitterness and a sense of ‘ princes at war ’ behind palace walls			0
@entity31 continues his policy of slimming down the monarchy , although his ‘ magnificent seven ’ of royals who really matter in the @entity256 — the @entity6 and @entity47 , himself and @entity30 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity257 — is now eight with its youngest star , @entity13			1
‘ @entity30 ’s enhanced importance is petrol on the flames , ’ says one close figure			2
‘ @entity0 in particular will never get used to being permanently upstaged , and he is fuming about his daughters @entity264 and @entity265 being pushed to the margins of royal life			0
he is constantly reminding ­ people they are the only two ‘ blood princesses ’ of their generation			0
he thinks it is is disgraceful			0
‘ @entity3 is furious that @entity4 now has to curtsey to @entity30			2
@entity274 , though , could n’t care less			0
’ through all this , the former maitresse en titre glides effortlessly beside the @entity0 , soothing his brow one moment , cajoling him the next			0
if she is eventually crowned @entity279 , will it be his triumph , or hers ?			0
