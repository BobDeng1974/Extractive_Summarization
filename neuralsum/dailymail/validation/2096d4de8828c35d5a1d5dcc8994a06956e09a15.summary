the @entity0 is often captured in all its beauty with a series of images that show off its romantic side			1
but an @entity7 filmmaker has created a three - minute video that presents @entity0 in an entirely unique way			1
@entity10 , a 31 - year - old from @entity11 , used special effects to make the @entity15 capital 's famous landmarks , including the @entity16 and @entity17 , and pedestrians look like miniature toys			1
the video is the work of photographer @entity10 , who studied at the @entity23 the @entity7 video maker captures a shot of the @entity16 in the distance of his unique film @entity10 filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend , a @entity32 student who is studying in @entity0			1
he said : ‘ when i went to visit her we decided to make this video			0
on her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film			2
‘ we could n't film on rainy , cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times			2
’ @entity10 , who was educated at @entity41 , but later studied at a film school in @entity43 , explained that his intention was to present the @entity15 capital in a way it has never been seen before			2
@entity10 experimented with effects that make @entity0 famous landmarks look like small toy sets the people captured underneath the @entity16 in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines he said : ‘ my goal was to show @entity0 to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites			2
’ the video opens on a landscape shot of the city , with the @entity16 and @entity64 appearing to be positioned almost too close together			0
the @entity65 is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it , appearing to look like figurines			0
@entity10 spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images a train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child shots of boats travelling under bridges tie @entity0 ' natural beauty with its urban iconography a couple of timelapse shots of the @entity16 continue this theme before a train , which looks like it could be being controlled by a child , travels across a bridge			1
more landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football			0
as darkness descends on the @entity0 streets the landscapes become more beautiful , before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell			2
@entity10 recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in @entity0 the @entity17 is momentarily captured before more close - ups shots of people looking like toys a distant shot of the @entity17 is momentarily captured before more close - ups of people negotiating busy streets			1
eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons , a boat travelling under a bridge – which ties @entity0 ’ beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together – and a casual shot of the @entity16			1
discussing the difficulties faced while filming , @entity10 explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation			0
@entity10 's goal was to show @entity0 in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it @entity10 had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality ‘ it 's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect			1
i spent two weeks testing different ways to change the " texture " of the image , ’ he said			0
‘ i experimented with some really distorted toy - like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect			0
this was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening			0
’ @entity10 ’s work is available on his @entity145 page and the original video can be viewed here .			0

@entity10 , from @entity11 , created the three - minute footage over eight days
