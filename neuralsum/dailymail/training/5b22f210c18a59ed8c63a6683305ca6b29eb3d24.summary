by @entity1 reporter published : 07:18 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 21 august 2013 a grandmother who booked a dream package holiday to @entity4 arrived at her hotel only to find she ’d been taken to @entity6			1
@entity7 flew june @entity8 , 66 , and friend @entity9 to @entity4 ’s @entity10 - before putting them on a bus and driving them 100 miles over the border to @entity6 ’s @entity15			1
when june returned to @entity16 , she complained to the tour operator , who has now offered her £ 200 compensation			1
disappointed : june @entity8 , 66 , ( pictured ) is still waiting for the trip to @entity4 that she asked @entity7 to book for her , after she was sent to @entity6 instead but mrs @entity23 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , is still waiting for the £ 1,247 @entity4 holiday she paid for			1
she said : ' the customer service people keep saying , " what ’s wrong ? did n’t you like the hotel ? " and i keep saying the hotel was fine but i was n’t in @entity4			2
it ’s like booking a holiday to @entity35 and ending up in @entity16			0
' if i sit in a seat and ask a holiday company to book me a holiday to the @entity39 i expect to end up in the right country			0
' mrs @entity23 , 66 , booked the break at the @entity7 store at @entity25 's @entity43			1
she said : ' i used to work for a cruise operator so i ’ve been to most of @entity45 but had never been to @entity4 so i was really keen to go			2
' the tour operator told mrs @entity23 they ’d found her a seven - day trip to the @entity39 - the southernmost point of mainland @entity4			1
armed with a booking confirmation , she hurried home to pack , her head full of the region ’s beautiful hilltop villages and beaches			0
but after the flight to @entity10 the trip took an unexpected turn			2
@entity59 snaps : the friends said that while the hotel and food was nice , it was n't what mrs @entity23 had asked @entity7 to book for them in @entity6 : mrs @entity23 booked the holiday for her and her friend @entity9 , right			1
they wanted to visit @entity4 's @entity39 , but ended up at the @entity69 , left , on @entity6 's @entity15 , near @entity70 june said : ' during the journey , people were commenting that there were @entity6 road signs but we just dismissed it			1
then we arrived at the hotel and it really began to dawn on us that it was n’t @entity4			2
' i went up to the rep and said " where are we ? " and she said " @entity6 , is there a problem ? " and i said , " yes , i should be in the @entity39 "			1
she just said it would be difficult to move us because there might not be a free hotel and that we ’d definitely enjoy it here			0
' with no other option , mrs @entity23 and her two companions forged ahead with the holiday at the @entity69 hotel , near @entity70			0
she added : ' the food was good and clean but we were stuck in @entity6 in the middle of nowhere			0
' it ’s the type of place where everyone just sits by the pool all day			0
i ended up spending a fortune on day trips to @entity101 , where i ’d been before			0
' june @entity8 and her friend @entity9 were flown to @entity10 , in the @entity39 of @entity4 , then driven 100 miles to a hotel in @entity69 , near @entity70 , in @entity6 since her return , mrs @entity23 has been twice to the @entity43 store to complain and made three calls to customer services			1
only after the press was alerted was she offered compensation			0
a spokeswoman for @entity7 @entity112 & @entity113 said : ' we know how important holidays are for our customers , and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that may have occurred when mrs @entity23 booked her holiday with us			2
' while mrs @entity23 did not query her holiday confirmation documents prior to travel , whereupon we could have amended her booking , we can confirm that we are speaking to her with a view to resolving this matter to her satisfaction			0
' mrs @entity23 ' holiday confirmation document says they are going to ‘ @entity15 , @entity39 ’			0
some travel agents do refer to @entity15 as ‘ the @entity6 @entity39 ’ - but @entity69 is not in the @entity39			0
on @entity7 ’s website it comes under the heading of @entity6 with no mention of the word ‘ @entity39 ’ .			1

june @entity8 , 66 , booked a dream trip to @entity4 as she *'d* never been before
@entity7 flew her to @entity10 , @entity4 , but then bussed her to @entity6
when she complained the rep questioned what the problem was
she 's been offered £ 200 compensation but still awaits a trip to @entity4
