as well as having it ’s name behind one of @entity5 football ’s biggest clubs @entity3 , @entity6 now looks set to have its name in front of one of the world ’s most emblematic stadiums – the @entity13			2
the @entity15 emirate that has bankrolled @entity3 entered into a financial partnership with @entity17 last november and for around £ 15million a year over a reported 20 - year period they have won the naming rights for the club ’s stadium according to @entity22			1
@entity23 and @entity24 had both shown an interest in having their name on the @entity13 but the race looks to have been won by the @entity29 energy company @entity28 which in turn is owned by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) which is owned by the @entity6 government			1
@entity17 's @entity13 stadium is set to be renamed @entity34 the @entity13 was opened in 1947 and is one of the most iconic venues in world football name : @entity13 capacity : 81,044 built : 1944 - 47 opened : 1947 first match : @entity17 3 - 1 @entity43 the stadium was named after former @entity17 chairman @entity45			2

in november of last year when the three - year tie - up between @entity31 and @entity17 announced by @entity17 , president @entity52 was caught on camera saying the stadium will be called ‘ @entity31 or @entity56 , whatever they want ’			1
according to the as report the sponsors have settled for ‘ @entity34 ’			0
the stadium was named after former @entity17 chairman @entity45 the renaming will not take place until the stadium is remodelled			1
planning permission for the £ 375m project is currently stalled because of a @entity66 enquiry into possible illegal state aid			0

it was revealed last week that @entity17 are the world 's richest club in terms of revenue , raking in a staggering £ 459.5m in 2013 - 14 and the renaming of the stadium to earn extra cash is certain to anger supporters of this traditional club			2

the £ 300m @entity6 investment will be the club 's most lucrative deal in its history and , as well as helping fund the redevelopment of the famous old ground , will give @entity17 the best chance of staying ahead of @entity102 rivals @entity103			1
