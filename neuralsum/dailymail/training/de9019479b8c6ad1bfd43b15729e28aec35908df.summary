it is a real drop but he got what he deserved preying on an old lady like that			0

the first time was about two years ago when a man sneaked into my house at tea time and hid under the stairs for hours			0
' when i went to bed around midnight it just felt like something was wrong , so i kept getting up			0
around 3am the man popped out from under my bed , apologised and ran off			0
' that was horrific , especially thinking about what could have happened			0
to be targeted again is horrible			0
' detective inspector @entity151 , from @entity54 said : ' this @entity18 footage shows the lengths opportunist thieves will go to			2
if they see an open window or door , they will take their chances and , in @entity7 's case , risk life and limb to get into your home			2
' i hope people are reassured that @entity7 is now off the streets and behind bars for a considerable amount of time			2
' at the same time , i hope this acts as a warning to residents to make sure they lock their doors and windows before they go out and before they go to bed			0
