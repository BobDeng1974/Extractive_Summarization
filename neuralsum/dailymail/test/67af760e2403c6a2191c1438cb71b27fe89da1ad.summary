doctors who treated brain cancer sufferer @entity2 in @entity3 yesterday accused the boy ’s parents of putting his life at risk when they refused to let him have chemotherapy			2
consultant @entity9 told a @entity11 documentary @entity13 ’s chances of long - term survival could have been halved by @entity15 and @entity17 ’s decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here			1
dr @entity9 , clinical director for child health at @entity20 , claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five - year - old ’s cancer returning			1
’ mr and mrs @entity17 had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a ‘ vegetable ’ and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy , an alternative form of radiotherapy			1
mr @entity17 , 51 , said @entity13 did not need subsequent chemotherapy as his cancer was in remission			0
last month , four months after the proton treatment ended , the family said scans showed ‘ no evidence ’ of the tumour			0
but dr @entity9 , a paediatric intensive care consultant , said @entity13 should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in @entity20 last july , and said it was too early to say he had been cured			2
he told the @entity11 : ‘ we are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is … every month that goes by that he ’s not getting chemotherapy , his outcome worsens			0
the family then went to @entity77 for proton beam therapy , and now say there is ' no evidence ' of a tumour ‘ there are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival – so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent , which is quite dramatic			1
’ dr @entity9 said there was an ‘ international consensus ’ of medical opinion that @entity13 ’s form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
after he had the surgery in @entity20 his parents took him from the hospital without telling doctors			0
he was eventually given radiotherapy in the form of proton beam therapy in the @entity104 , but his parents said the chemotherapy was not needed			2
they initially fled to @entity31 where they were arrested then released after the @entity107 approved their plan to take @entity13 to @entity77			0
the @entity109 eventually agreed to pay for the proton therapy there			0
dr @entity9 said there was a risk that tiny cancerous cells remained around the tumour site after the surgery , and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return			2
the @entity122 were unavailable for comment but have said they wanted @entity13 to receive the best possible treatment			0
paediatric intensive care consultant dr @entity9 said it was ' deeply unfair when the @entity109 is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all ’ that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children			1

doctors and *nurses* have *criticised* @entity13 *'s* parents in @entity11 documentary
dr @entity9 claims chemotherapy was essential to reduce chances of five - year - old ’s cancer returning
complained of ‘ vitriol ’ to which he had been subjected as a result of case
consultant warns case - which saw parents *ignore* medical *advice* to take @entity13 to @entity77 for proton beam therapy - could set a worrying *precedent*
