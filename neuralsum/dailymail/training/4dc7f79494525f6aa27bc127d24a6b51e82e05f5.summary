by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:52 est , 21 february 2014 holding an umbrella , plus your bag and anything else you need when out and about in the rain can make enjoying a coffee on the go rather tricky			2
but that 's all about to change because a gadget has been invented to stop rain - lashed commuters being forced to awkwardly juggle a brolly with their morning coffee			1
and it 's so good , you 'll wonder why you did n't think of it yourself ! now you can stay dry and still hold a cuppa while out and about in the rain a nifty new invention means you can easily hold your umbrella without struggle to enjoy a coffee on the go the device is a cup holder which clips on to the centre pole of an umbrella and enables a user to carry their drinks with ease			1
the contraption is able to pivot , which means your beverage will stay upright whether your brolly is furled or open			2
the nifty new invention , called the @entity37 , enables people to have a spare hand which they can use to carry a bag , check their phone or change a track on their mp3 player			2
it can be removed and attached within minutes by twisting the nut on the side and will fit a variety of different sized umbrellas			0
it comes in two models - one for single cups , and another that can hold two drinks			1
the @entity37 lets you hold a single cup of your favourite drink or you can help a mate and hold two the product was invented by friends @entity61 , 35 , @entity62 , 36 , and @entity63 , 30			1
@entity61 , from @entity64 , said : ' my friend @entity65 was outside a pub in when it started to rain , so he had his drink in one hand and an umbrella in the other			1
' he then realised there could be a product that would make them easier to hold and got in touch with me and another friend , @entity77			0
you do n't have to be on the move			0
use your umbrella as a handy cup holder when you 're chatting with friends ' initially i laughed and then i realised that it could actually be something really useful and that it just might work			2
' we made a few prototypes out of cardboard and then approached some designers and got it patented			0
' @entity88 comes in two different styles , a single cup holder and a double cup holder			1
' someone can easily attach one to an umbrella by unscrewing the nut , putting it around the pole , and then screwing it back on			0
' the holder can move so that no matter how the umbrella is held , the drinks will always stay upright because the centre of gravity is below the pivot			0
' it makes it easier to carry an umbrella and a drink and frees up a hand to hold a bag , get something out of a pocket , use a mobile phone or change the song on an mp3 player			0
' it ’s perfect for commuters who might be carrying a lot of things or for festival - goers who are trying to fetch a couple of drinks in the rain			0
' the @entity37 has been launched on @entity124 where @entity61 , @entity65 , and @entity77 hope to raise £ 35,000 for the manufacturing process			1
the expected retail price for the single - cup device is between £ 5 and £ 10 , and between £ 8 and £ 12 for the double			1
with the @entity37 you have a free hand to send emails , texts and make calls in the rain			0
