by the time @entity1 was replaced in the final minute , the mask had gone and the jeers had melted into applause			0
the appreciative majority overwhelmed the vocal minority to offer a tribute to the @entity7 , one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an @entity11 shirt in the modern era			2
it ’s true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for @entity11 it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have			2
@entity1 was booed by large portions of the @entity11 supporters upon his return to the @entity29 @entity1 was cheered - albeit sarcastically - by the same set of fans when he was booked for diving however when the @entity34 midfielder was substituted in the dying moments he was given an applause @entity37 ( away ) - may 4 @entity38 ( home ) - may 11 @entity40 ( away ) - may 17 @entity41 ( home ) may 20 @entity43 ( home ) - may 24 there have been genuine signs of promise in @entity48 and reasons for optimism in 2015 , even if @entity51 was unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against @entity54			1
it is 13 games and counting , and while the @entity11 boss insists it matters not a jot , it is much to @entity54 ’s amusement			2
‘ it ’s about our club and our team , not about me , ’ said @entity51			1
‘ we wanted to win the game for the club			2
what is important is what happens on the football pitch			0
@entity11 are third in the @entity71 , level on points with @entity74 but with a game in hand ‘ we want to finish the season well			1
every game is difficult but we need to keep the focus until the end of the season			0
we want to secure the top four , then the top three and the top two , before the @entity83 final			2
’ to finish as runners - up , for the first time in a decade , and successfully defend the @entity83 , can be framed as progress			1
more significant is the development of @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
together with a philosophical tweak , it has made @entity11 a more solid defensive unit , capable of taking points from @entity74 and @entity34 and winning at @entity40 in the @entity83			1
@entity89 and @entity90 were both ready to make smart fouls at the expense of yellow cards to stop the visitors as they sought to counter quickly			1
this is not a typical @entity11 trait			2
@entity88 has been outstanding and few have contained @entity102 this season as effectively as the teenager did on sunday , but @entity11 need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer			1
‘ we have closed the gap since the start of the season , ’ said @entity51			1
‘ but what happened is that they had the experience at the back and could close the game down			0
‘ the build - up was quick and sharp but the final ball was n’t there			0
’ with five to play , @entity11 trail the champions - elect by 10 points and must concentrate on catching @entity34 in the knowledge their rivals from the capital ’s west will strengthen again in the summer			1
amid the progress , there remain reasons for concern			0
despite the flair overload of @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , they could not break down a @entity54 team determined to protect their clean sheet			0
@entity137 defender @entity88 ( left ) has come on leaps and bounds for the @entity140 this season @entity89 of @entity11 evades @entity1 of @entity34 during the 0 - 0 draw at @entity29 on sunday @entity132 had glimpses of goal , but @entity144 did to @entity133 what @entity88 did to @entity102			1
@entity34 finished the game with a midfield trio of @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , which together with their usually resolute back four amounted to a seven - man defensive shield			0
in the @entity154 studio , @entity11 legend @entity152 questioned the quality of 18 - goal striker @entity156			1
‘ @entity51 has to strengthen , ’ said @entity152			1
‘ in order to win the league you need great players			0
i do n’t think you can win the league with @entity156			2
@entity90 ( left ) is among the @entity140 players who have impressed recently and did so against @entity34 ‘ @entity34 struggled last year but they went out to buy ( @entity164 ) @entity163 , @entity1 , @entity148 and ( @entity166 ) @entity165			1
you see today the difference between a team that did and a team that did n’t strengthen			0
@entity11 still need four top players			0
’ those four would be straight down the spine of the team			0
imagine @entity11 if you threaded @entity163 , @entity176 , @entity148 and @entity165 through the centre of their fast and fluent side			0
@entity11 do not long for a @entity1			0
they have players who can offer his vision and passing range			0
perhaps the supporters who applauded him from the pitch have come to accept this			0
@entity152 said @entity11 will not win the @entity71 if they do not buy another striker but @entity34 do have individuals who would offer extra physical presence and match - winning know - how which would provide a platform for those like @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 to deliver			1
@entity152 must realise this is not the @entity51 way but time for nurturing is running out			2
the @entity11 manager has two more years on what could be his final contract			1
if he is to close the gap , catch @entity34 next season and end this hoodoo against @entity54 , then it must be done in the summer transfer market .			0

@entity11 legend @entity152 says ‘ @entity51 has to strengthen ’ the @entity140
however the progress of @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 has been significant this season
to come second in the @entity71 and defend the @entity83 can be seen as progress
but the @entity11 manager has two years on what could be his final contract
@entity133 says @entity11 must *challenge* for the title next season
@entity152 : @entity11 ca *n't* win title with @entity156 in attack
