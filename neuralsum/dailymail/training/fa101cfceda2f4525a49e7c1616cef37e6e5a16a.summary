by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ charliefscott @entity2 needs to learn to adapt his @entity4 team when they face top opposition in order to mount a serious @entity8 title challenge , according to former @entity10 right - back @entity9			1
@entity9 believes @entity4 were very fortunate to escape with a point at @entity12 after battling back from two goals down to draw 2 - 2 with @entity14 in the @entity8 on saturday			1
' they ’ll be delighted to get out of there [ @entity12 ] with a draw , ' said @entity18 on @entity20 's @entity19			2
' they ’ve got out of jail in the last ten minutes			2
they continued to keep going but that ’s the least a @entity8 team can do			0
stuck in his ways : @entity9 thinks @entity4 have no chance of challenging for the @entity8 title unless their manager @entity2 learns to adapt against the best teams in the division late charge at @entity12 : @entity35 's header grabbed @entity4 a point after they had been two goals down making a difference : @entity35 celebrates his fine header against the @entity14 on saturday afternoon ' @entity2 does not seem to adapt in any way shape or form for opposition teams in the @entity8			1
and even with his signings , you ’d think that they ’re crying for presence			2
@entity46 against @entity47 is a mismatch			1
' it happened last year where they had problems in that situation , ' @entity9 added			1
' so you think to yourself that they ’d need a presence in midfield to support them in these type of games			0
he does n’t seem to adjust his principles for any opposition team			0
he only thinks about what @entity4 are going to do and that they ’ll always come out on top , but it ’s not working now year after year against the bigger teams			1
hurry up : @entity66 grabs the ball after scoring @entity4 's first goal against @entity14 to make it 2 - 1 ' @entity4 ’s problems are always against the biggest teams , the best teams			1
they bully the other teams when they out football them , but generally i would say they ’re going to have to change if they ’re going to want to go that extra mile that they need to get to the championship			2
they ’re not going to do it with that type of player all the way through the team			0
you need two or three but not seven or eight of them			0
@entity9 also spoke about @entity4 's @entity86 qualifier against @entity87 on wednesday			1
' i hope they qualify , ' he said			0
' we want our teams to be in the @entity86 , we need our teams to be in the @entity86 because it ’s great for @entity93 football			0
' we want our teams to do well because our league improves through it			0
i think there are signs now that were are getting better in the past couple of years but we still have some way to go to catch up with the very best in @entity100 and the very best in @entity101			0
