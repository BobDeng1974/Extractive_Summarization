finding yourself stuck in traffic and needing a toilet break can be an unpleasant experience			1
but what if you could spend a penny while on the move ? a plumber has built the world 's fastest fully - functioning toilet which has a powerful 140cc motorbike engine hidden under the seat and four gears			1
there is also a clip so he can read the newspaper while he zooms along			0
the petrol - powered lavatory can almost reach the national speed limit and does 10 miles to the gallon			0
' it is quite scary to drive as the water in the toilet makes it very top heavy and i get wet when i go over any bumps , ' said mr @entity15 , from @entity36 , @entity37			1
toilet training : @entity19 spent a month building the breakneck bog which is even filled with water so it can be flushed never caught short : the high speed lavatory even has a clip so mr @entity15 can read the newspaper while he zooms along @entity44 - py : the petrol - powered lavatory can almost reach the national speed limit and does 10 miles to the gallon ' the toilet seat is also quite slippery so it 's hard to stay on and stop myself from sliding off when i go fast			1
it 's also pretty tricky to steer			0
' mr @entity15 , who is often called out to fix and install toilets , decided to build the super loo as a bit of @entity54 used a mobility scooter for the base and attached a steel frame with a wooden plinth before mounting the white toilet on top			2
he has fitted four electronic gears to the handlebars and built a manual override , disguised as a toilet brush in case they fail			2
mr @entity15 has also added a towel rail to the back of the toilet , covered the base with black and white lino tiles and turned the exhaust into a toilet roll holder to make it look authentic			2
do n't forget to flush : the toilet has a powerful 140cc motorbike engine hidden under the seat when nature calls : if you are someone with a poor bladder you might want to hop on @entity15 's super loo ' i 'm a plumber and i 'm used to putting toilets together so i thought i 'd try the challenge of making the fastest , ' said mr @entity15			1
' i 've seen people build them before using mopeds , but i 've given mine a more powerful engine so it can go much faster			1
' mr @entity15 has managed to get the toilet to travel at an amazing 55mph but believes it will be able to go even faster along a smooth track and may even reach 60mph			0
the previous fastest toilet was the @entity94 , which could travel at 42.25mph and was presented on the set of @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 in march 2011			0
a @entity100 stunt woman @entity99 recorded a speed of 46mph on a motorised toilet in @entity103 last year , but this was not verified by @entity105			0
mr @entity15 will be doing an official time trial at the @entity107 in @entity108 upon @entity109 on saturday and hopes to gain a place in the @entity111 .			0
