by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 12:27 est , 17 july 2013 @entity2 's autumn / winter womenswear range was given a resounding thumbs by fashionistas when it was unveiled last week - even winning over the @entity6 's fashion critic @entity5			0
now the menswear collection has been revealed and the @entity9 high street brand will be hoping for positive feedback leading to a boast in sales			1
aiming for a younger audience , the collection is modelled by rising star @entity15 from @entity16			2
dapper : bold colours and classic cuts feature in the ' @entity20 ' from @entity2 ' fantastic value ' : this @entity23 style suit costs £ 800 the chiseled cheekboned 24 - year - old has already helped tills ring at @entity2 by modelling their swimwear and also boosted sales at @entity29 when he became a face of the brand			1
now the boyfriend of popstar @entity34 lends his effortlessly cool image to the @entity2 range that aims to celebrate the best in @entity9 design and manufacture			1
the brand say the ' @entity41 ' - made entirely using @entity9 designers , fabrics and manufacturers - ' combines our rich heritage with modern styling to create an edit of timeless pieces with an emphasis on true @entity9 craftsmanship and quality			1
' the garments have been made from fabrics such as @entity56 cashmere through to @entity58 cloths			0
bold yellow , blue and red jumpers brighten up an autumnal look when combined with grey suits while crisp white shirts can be dressed up for a smart work look or down for a geek chic appearance			0
something for everyone : head of menswear design @entity66 said they hope the collection appeals to a younger audience as well as older customers as with the womenswear , coats are a key element of the collection with checked overcoats , tweed and fitted styles allowing wearers to be suave as well as warm			1
head of menswear design @entity66 told @entity80 that the jewel in the crown of the collection is a @entity23 quality suit for £ 800			1
' i love the idea of a young guy wearing one of our @entity90 jackets with jeans and brogues whereas your classic guy is going to wear it with a lambswool and cords ' he said : ' the great thing with the company at the moment is what they can offer quality-wise is incredible			0
there are some pieces that are fantastic value for what they are			0
even though the £ 800 best of @entity9 suit is our most expensive suit ... to give the chap that accessibility to a suit that would normally off the peg in @entity23 cost £ 2,000 for £ 800 is something ! ' he added that in aiming for a younger market the brand do n't want to alienate their older fans but instead believe they can offer something for everyone depending on how an item is worn			1
he said : ' in terms of the brand itself we have a broad church of classic customers , but what we 're seeing increasingly is a growth in the under 35 market : people appreciating what we 're doing with quality and i 'm really trying to push the style aspect further			0
' i love the idea of a young guy wearing one of our @entity90 jackets with jeans and brogues whereas your classic guy is going to wear it with a lambswool and cords			0
' seal of approval : @entity149 described the collection as ' perfect ' and ' on trend ' in his blog @entity154 looks : the @entity9 brand hope to have successful sales with their revamped women 's and men 's ranges after his modelling gig , @entity149 gave the collection his own seal of approval			1
writing on his blog , i wear the trousers , he said : ' is this range of menswear from high street giant @entity2 the best they have ever produced ? that 's a big fat yes in my eyes , and it 's not just because i 'm face of the campaign			0
' every item in the @entity177 collection is perfect , massively on trend and very wearable and that 's not to mention the quality of the material and cuts of suits			1
the stand out pieces are their beautiful double - breasted , @entity188 - checked overcoats , and their grey speckled suits - they would n't look out of place in any of the biggest runway shows around the world ! @entity194 has so stepped up to the mark and way beyond it with this range and i feel very honoured to be part of this fashion history			0
' ' @entity2 are showing that a mainstream , high - street retailer can return to producing in @entity9 if they want to			2
returning to their @entity205 roots , the collection offers the best of the @entity208 , most notably tweeds and knitwear			2
while some may think £ 800 for a suit is expensive , it is actually good value			1
for something comparable with a designer name and made in the @entity9 , you would be looking at least double , if not triple the price			2
' @entity219 , founder & creative director , @entity221 ' it 's rare that you actually say to yourself , i want everything in the collection , but on this occasion , that 's actually how i feel			2
@entity2 have pulled it out of the bag , it hits the exact right balance of being directional , stylish and completely wearable and if that was n't enough all the range is produced to the highest of quality , right here in @entity238 ! ' @entity239 , editor in chief clothes - make - the - @entity241 ' what i like about this collection is that @entity2 has resisted the temptation to play safe with middle - aged grunge			2
what i saw is a collection of beautifully - made classics , for both men and women , interpreted in a snappy and very contemporary way			0
