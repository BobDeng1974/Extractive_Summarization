by @entity0 he 's spent weeks surviving on nothing more than cow 's blood and milk , faced down great white sharks and lived for months in the @entity8 jungle			1
but despite his dark good looks - and impressive survival skills - tv explorer @entity10 , 40 , says none of it is anywhere near as difficult as finding lasting love , even if he does admit that his constant travels do n't always help			1
' a great white has the ability to tear your arms off , ' chuckles @entity10 , who is currently starring in @entity21 's @entity22			1
' i ’ve been giving this love stuff a pretty good shot - my last relationship lasted for six years , ' explains @entity10			1
' and i loved being crazy in love			2
the problem was , it was crazy - it had an uncanny resemblance to @entity44 ! ' i barely came out of that alive and i was lucky my cat did n’t get boiled ! at least i know where never to venture again			2
' while boiling cats is a definite no - no , @entity10 , a regular consumer of gruesome foods , says cooking is a sure way to his heart , although you do n't have to be good at it			2
do n't hurt my cat ! @entity10 says he likes a girl who can cook , although he 'd prefer that his cat does n't get boiled tough guy : @entity10 spends much of his time travelling , in this case in the @entity59 with the @entity60 / ' hoansi @entity62 people ' i rarely complain about the cook ’s abilities , ' he explains			1
' being able to cook is a major turn on but she does n’t have to a good one			0
' being able to put up with a night in a tent and a penchant for travel to off - the - beaten track destinations also help , as does being able to shin up a tree - a favourite first date test of @entity10 's			1
' i have been known to assess a date on whether they climbed a tree with me or not , ' he confesses			0
' but the best dates i have had are the ones where there are sparkles by the end and that just plain does n’t happen that often			0
' part of the reason for that , of course , is @entity10 's passion for travelling			2
@entity87 took him to six different countries and he 's currently in @entity89 working on his other career as a biologist			2
survival skills : @entity10 says he likes a girl who does n't mind roughing it in a tent in the wilderness occasionally holiday trip : @entity10 says he would take a girl to the @entity30 - definitely not @entity100 's chilly wilderness nevertheless , he says he would eventually like someone to come home to - and in return , would occasionally swap remote wildernesses for ' sand and palm trees type places ' for the right girl			1
' of course i enjoy travel but if i know it would n't be the sort of trip that would be a recipe for disaster , then i 'd love to share my experiences with the girl of my dreams			1
' for this type of travel i prefer beaches with palm trees , white sand and tropical fish			1
even better would be with a hut in the village i filmed in the @entity30			0
regardless of the sharks , i ’d like to go back there , hopefully with a lovely girlfriend			2
' so what else does it take to impress the intrepid explorer ? according to @entity10 , looking good and smelling nice are important , although you do n't necessarily need to brave tribal living			2
' i need a woman that is certainly strong enough to rough it camping and loves getting dirty , ' he adds			0
' but a girl who is feminine and smells really nice - yeah ! i like that ! ' helpful : if you 're looking for a man who knows how to see off a ( gigantic ) spider , @entity10 is the one for you @entity142 beauty : @entity10 admits to a fondness for ' smart and feminine ' @entity142 women - ideally from @entity145 @entity142 women get the thumbs up too , although it 's to the @entity149 rather than @entity150 that @entity10 is looking to for a @entity142 love			1
' some of those @entity142 women have stolen my heart , ' he chortles			1
' one of the main things that impresses me about @entity142 women is that they embrace being smart			1
' they celebrate being intellectual and are not afraid of having educated original thoughts and conversation but they also have a refined femininity which i like			0
' the problem is , i do n’t know many well enough to know if they like getting dirty and embracing the rugged			0
i think i need more experience to give a better assessment			0
' @entity150 is amazing , ' he continues , ' but in all honesty , it ’s too big and crazy for me			0
i love it when i visit but i love the smaller towns and countryside too			0
comfort zone : while he is happy to be in remote @entity171 , he says he can only handle small doses of @entity150 tough guy : @entity10 's travels have included a stint with @entity178 's blood - drinking @entity177 people ' as far as cities go , i 'm in love with @entity145			1
i ca n't wait to get back to the @entity142 and i 'm hoping to get back as soon as possible			1
' in the meantime , smart @entity142 girls looking for a rugged adventurer will have to content themselves with watching survive the @entity184 is , for now , deep in the @entity89 jungle			1
' i help lead trips over there whenever possible , ' he explains			0
' this time , i 'm on a two - week adventure with biology teachers from all over the world to teach them about the tropical rainforest and to discuss new ways of teaching science			0
' it ’s like camp for a bunch of adventurous , science - obsessed , nerdy , adults - we all have quite a blast			0
' when he returns , he says it might be time to start his search for love in earnest , although he adds that he has no intention of putting up with a girl with plans to play games			2
' i ’m not interested in playing games , ' he sniffs			0
' i am impressed by a woman that does what she says she is going to do and knows how to be a good person for herself and others			0
' those are the only kind of women that know a good man when they see it			0
' presumably , you imagine , one like @entity10 himself			0
