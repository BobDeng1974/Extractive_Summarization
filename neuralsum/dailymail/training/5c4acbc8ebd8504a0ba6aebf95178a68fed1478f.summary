@entity0 believes @entity1 have no chance of winning the @entity3 this season as they do n't have enough quality in defence			1
a @entity8 brace handed @entity1 a 2 - 1 win against @entity10 on monday night , but @entity12 's side managed just three shots in the match , the lowest number by any team in the @entity3 this season			1
however , it is @entity1 's defensive quality that really concerns @entity0 , and the former full back believes his old side are some way off being able to challenge for the league title			1
' they 've been decimated with injuries			2
to say can they go and win the title ? i think they 're too short defensively at this moment in time			0
i do n't think they 're at that level i really do n't			0
' they 're going to have to step it up			0
they look shaky on the ball			0
they lack counter attack , they lack speed , they did n't have anything			2
' they 've got away with murder tonight			0
@entity1 will be happy with the result but they will have to play better than that			1
' i think they will get better , they 're showing a bit of resilience			0
that 's a good quality to have but they need to play better			2
' @entity1 looked shaky at the back and @entity12 was forced to make changes before half time @entity67 was also substituted due to injury , leaving @entity12 with even fewer options			1

@entity1 beat @entity10 2 - 1 at @entity27 's on monday night
@entity8 scored a brace and @entity73 scored
but @entity1 only had three shots all game and looked poor at the back too
@entity0 said his old side lack the quality to challenge for the league
@entity12 *unhappy* with @entity0 after @entity1 vs @entity83 is referred to as ' the @entity84 versus the @entity85 '
