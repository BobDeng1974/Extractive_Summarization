by @entity0 an @entity2 man who loved @entity3 so much he wrote books about it has been deported from @entity3			1
@entity6 left his native @entity7 , @entity8 , for @entity3 's second largest city of @entity10 a decade ago and became an unofficial ambassador , appearing on tv and running a website called kingofromania.com			1
but in april @entity3 's @entity14 began proceedings to remove him after saying his stay had not been legal for six and a half years			1
he lost a court appeal , making national headlines as offcers drove him to the border with @entity21 and told him not to come back until 2017			1
deported : @entity6 ( left with his girlfriend @entity23 and right ) moved to @entity3 10 years ago from @entity8 and loved it so much he talked about it on tv			1
now he has been told to leave and barred from returning cross : the 41 - year - old said : ' i could n't believe it when they turned up at my door and told me i was being deported			1
at first i thought they were @entity34 due to the way they were standing with paperwork ' the 41 - year - old insisted he had simply fallen foul of red tape , forgetting to renew his visa , and wanted nothing more than to stay with his @entity3 girlfriend and his possessions			1
he was known in local media as ' @entity45 ' ( @entity6 the @entity3 ) because of his passion for the country , appearing on national television and joking : ' i 'm more @entity3 than you are '			1
his wrote tourist guides and blogs about his adopted home for several years , including a ' @entity54 's guide to @entity3 ' in 2011			1
but the @entity3 immigration service said that by forgetting to extend his stay , which would probably have been automatically approved , he qualified for a ban			2
joke : the @entity2 citizen posted memes like this one about his adopted home on his @entity63 page that meant armed officers dragged him from his home for violating immigration law			2
he complained he was not given time to arrange for anybody to care for his pet cats			0
' i could n't believe it when they turned up at my door and told me i was being deported , ' he said			0
' at first i thought the two people at the door were @entity34 due to the way they were standing in front of my door with paperwork in their hand			0
' but when they identified themselves as immigration officers and said they were there for me , i thought it was a joke			2
it was only when they started to cart me off that i realised they were serious			0
' i was told it was a minor matter but as soon as they got me in the car and took me to the police station , i was banged up in a tiny cell where i was surrounded by immigration officers including one guy that was shouting at me and demanding to know why was breaking the law			0
' to be honest they treated me like a child molester , not just somebody who 'd forgot to extend his visa			0
i was kept there for five hours and they would n't even let me go to the bathroom			0
' mr @entity6 complained that during his appeal - which he lost at the end of june - he was given a translator who did not speak @entity108			1
his pleas that he intended to marry his @entity3 girlfriend @entity23 also went unheeded , he said			2
explaining the alleged mix - up , he said : ' i came into the country on a tourism visa and then became part of a local company that gave me a permanent visa , but my trouble started when that got stolen			2
' i guess what happened after that was lost in translation and now i suddenly find myself evicted			0
' popular : mr @entity6 , left and right signing what he said was his last autograph before leaving the country the self - appointed @entity3 expert is now staying with friends in southern @entity128			1
@entity129 , the chief commissioner of @entity10 's immigration service , said : ' he legally entered the country six to seven years ago and forgot to leave			1
' in order to stay in the country for so long , he should have contacted any local office and requested the extension of his stay			0
' anyone that comes here needs to obey the law			0
those that do n't obey the law have to face the consequences			0
' as both nations are part of the @entity146 , @entity143 are free to live and work in @entity3 and vice versa after restrictions were lifted on january 1			2
but @entity2 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 must apply for a visa if they are staying for longer than 90 days .			0
