within hours of the fatal fire , the behaviour of @entity1 and @entity2 was already arousing the suspicions of the police			1
the couple were keen to ‘ get rich quick ’ off the back of the children ’s deaths , receiving at least £ 3,100 directly in cash gifts which they used to buy new sportswear and to get drunk at parties			1
@entity2 remained shameless to the last - and he was still smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children			1
today the trio face sentencing for their deadly actions			0
far from being an anguished father , @entity1 's inappropriate actions in the aftermath of the blaze made investigators suspicious			0
a shrine to the six dead children : @entity2 tried to auction teddy bears left in memory of his children flowers piled high : the community left teddies outside the @entity49 ' home in @entity50 , @entity51			1
@entity1 wanted to sell the teddies and keep the money the pattern of extraordinary behaviour also saw @entity2 : fake a collapse and joke around in a hospital mortuary sing the 1975 @entity58 songs @entity59 and my boy on a pub karaoke machine and proposition a female police officer during a ‘ jovial ’ visit to a hospital when he called his children ‘ little sh * * * ’ appear at a barbecue where his drunken wife showed off a new pair of £ 80 pink trainers			1
become ‘ fixated ’ with creaming off the remainder of a fund to cover the children ’s funeral costs and convert it into @entity80 vouchers			1
tell fundraisers to collect and sell teddy bears which had been left outside the burned family home , ordering one wellwisher : ‘ shut up and just get on with it			1
’ play the entire second half of a charity football match staged to raise funds for the family			0
community in grief : the six dead children are carried into @entity94 's @entity93 in @entity95 , @entity51 , as they are laid to rest @entity2 called his children ' little sh * * * ' during a ' jovial ' visit to hospital prosecutors wanted to tell jurors about @entity2 ’s private thirst to ‘ spend ’ the cash or ‘ get rich quick ’ from it , arguing he had been presenting a ‘ very different public face ’			1
but the evidence was ruled inadmissible			0
the deadly gamble was to save the six youngsters , blame @entity112 , and win back custody of five children who had recently moved out of the cramped three - bedroom semi with her			0
yesterday @entity1 , @entity25 and @entity2 were found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at @entity119			2
the former live - in lover who @entity2 tried to frame for the fatal fire in a bitter custody battle is ' happy for the first time in years ' , it was revealed today			1
@entity31 , who had five children with the killer , left the house she shared with him and his wife @entity25 in a bizarre love triangle in february last year			2
but when took the children with her , @entity2 hatched a despicable plot to start a fire at his house and blame her			1
she was arrested the day after the blaze which killed six of his other children , but was released within hours			0
a source told @entity141 : ' she has escaped the nightmare that was living with @entity2 and @entity25			2
' she is now a new woman , happy for the first time in years			2
' assistant chief constable @entity143 , of @entity144 , said after yesterday 's verdict : ' we decided at a very early stage @entity31 was not involved			0
' @entity2 , 56 , shouted obscenities before saying ‘ it ’s not over yet ’ moments after mrs @entity151 asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘ out of respect for the memories ’ of the children he had killed			2
but with typical arrogance , @entity2 , who infamously appeared on the @entity158 to demand a bigger council house , crossed himself , waved and smiled as he was led away			0
on may 11 last year , after @entity2 had a sordid sex session with his wife and @entity2 on their home snooker table , the fire was lit , with the intention that the six children sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window , with @entity2 both ‘ the hero and the victim ’			1
but the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong			0
too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving @entity2 unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching @entity177			1
@entity178 , ten , and brothers @entity179 , 13 , @entity181 , nine , @entity182 , eight , @entity183 , six and @entity184 , five , all died of smoke inhalation			0
detectives started to take a firm interest in @entity1 soon as they began receiving witness statements which cast doubt on @entity2 ’s claim to have made repeated attempts to reach his children			2
while some heroic and soot - covered neighbours needed medical attention following their attempts to reach the six trapped children , @entity2 appeared ‘ spotlessly clean ’			2
he was spotted wandering off from his 32 - year - old wife and other relatives at the @entity201 for a 30 - minute discussion with his friend @entity2			0
he even had to be persuaded by police to travel with his dying stepson @entity179 , 13 , when it was decided to transfer the teenager to @entity208			0
devastation : the @entity2 's burnt out home in @entity50 , @entity51 , after the fire which killed the six children gutted : the blackened bathroom after the fire ripped through the home			1
@entity2 and @entity2 was found guilty of manslaughter and starting the blaze yesterday @entity1 and @entity2 wanted to ' get rich quick ' off the back of their six children 's deaths he died there three days later			1
@entity179 ’s godmother @entity221 said that in the hospital canteen ‘ they would all sit quiet and then all of a sudden they ’d all start a food fight and i was like , how can you have a food fight ? you have just lost six kids … i was just sitting there thinking “ no , this is not right ”			0
’ by the time of a press conference five days after the blaze , he and his wife were already under deep suspicion			1
@entity2 called the conference himself , ostensibly to thank the emergency services for their efforts to save his children			1
he appeared to be revelling in the ‘ celebrity ’ of being the father of six dead youngsters			0
during the trial , the court heard how @entity2 lived with his wife , @entity112 and their combined 11 children in his cramped three - bedroom council house in @entity248 , @entity51			2
but he was left irate after @entity112 , 29 , became disillusioned with his ‘ domineering behaviour ’ and summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her five children early last year			1
that decision to leave , taking with her more than £ 1,000 a month in benefit payments , was the ‘ catalyst for everything that was to follow ’			0
@entity143 , @entity259 assistant chief constable , compared @entity2 ’s demeanour to that of an ‘ excited child ’			0
far from seeming nervous , @entity2 chatted about his love of karaoke and singing @entity58 songs			0
tragic end : kind - hearted locals raised £ 15,000 for the funeral of @entity2 's six children ( top row , l - r ) @entity184 , five , @entity271 , six , @entity182 , eight , ( bottom row , l - r ) @entity181 , nine , @entity178 , 10 , and @entity273 , 13 he dabbed imaginary tears from his eyes during the brief conference , then performed a fake collapse in a corridor seconds after being ushered off stage			1
his wife said nothing throughout the event			0
just 24 hours earlier , the couple made their first of three ‘ circus - like ’ visits to the mortuary , in which @entity2 called his six dead children ‘ little sh * * * ’ , indulged in one - sided ‘ horseplay ’ with a police officer and asked for gin when he was offered water			2
yesterday @entity2 ’s sister , @entity294 , said his family believed ‘ justice has been served ’			2
‘ this past year has been a very difficult time for our family as we have had to come to terms with what @entity302 and @entity25 and @entity2 have done , ’ she said			1
‘ we can now attempt to move on and our six angels can rest in peace			0
’ mrs @entity2 ’s family said the children had been taken away in the ‘ cruellest way imaginable by the very people who were supposed to love and protect them			1
’ her sister @entity311 , who was ejected from the courtroom , said she was convinced of the @entity314 ’ guilt from the outset .			0
