@entity16 was the nickname given to the @entity19 bombers flown by the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) - which suffered huge losses of men between 1942 and 1945			1

' the ' @entity9 ' tribute - named after the bombers the @entity4 's eight @entity4 flew - from afar			1

887 of the crew were killed - around 19 per cent - and 123 were declared missing in action			0
another branded the move ' disgusting ' , adding : ' why do we have to put up with @entity131 as it is today ? it â€™s all going down the pan			0

a @entity152 spokesman said : ' a temporary screen was erected around the @entity24 @entity154 at @entity10			1
