@entity0 have not been blessed with many batsmen who thrive under pressure in one - day internationals but they may have found one in @entity5			1
for all the talk of the potential power hitters such as @entity8 , @entity9 and newly - installed captain @entity10 , @entity0 will need someone like @entity5 at @entity12 to hold together an innings if they are to regularly post the 300 - plus totals that will be necessary at next month ’s @entity15 in @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity5 is looking forward to the new era under @entity10 the 25 - year - old , who averaged 73 for @entity20 in one - day cricket in 2013 and 88 last year , finds himself in pole position to bat at three for @entity0 in the upcoming tri-series against @entity16 and @entity25			1
it is an opportunity he earned thanks to a brilliant knock of 90 in @entity29 last month , when he came back into the side following a 15 - month absence for the fourth odi in @entity33 after then captain @entity34 was banned for slow over-rate offences			0
‘ i knew i needed to take any opportunity that came my way and that arose when @entity34 could n’t play , ’ he said ahead of @entity0 ’s first warm - up match against an @entity37 on monday in @entity38			2
@entity0 captain @entity10 has been described as a ' strong leader ' by @entity5 ‘ i was put in a massively pressurised situation — if i did n’t score runs i was n’t going to the @entity15			1
but you want to be put in those situations because that means things are going well			0
' hopefully , i ’m put in those situations again where i ’m relied on			0
i had hopes of being here and always knew if i did score runs and kept knocking down that door the opportunity would arise			0
‘ i just want to win games for @entity0			2
