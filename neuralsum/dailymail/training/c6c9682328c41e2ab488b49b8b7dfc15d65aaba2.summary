by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 his @entity4 debut lasted 69 minutes but in that time @entity5 gave @entity7 supporters more than a glimpse of what is to come from their new no 7 in the future			1
@entity13 has only trained twice with his new team - mates , since his £ 60million move from @entity17 on tuesday , yet in spells on saturday afternoon at @entity19 it seemed he had been at @entity4 longer as he linked up neatly with @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity23 boss @entity22 deployed the 26 - year - old in central midfield of his 3 - 5 - 2 formation and @entity13 showed his energetic qualities that helped @entity17 win a @entity28 and @entity29 double last term			1
in the opening stages at @entity48 's first involvement in the match saw a trademark dribble ended by an over-hit pass into the path of @entity20			0
the skill involved , as he beat two men in the heart of @entity33 's midfield , was warmly appreciated by the travelling @entity4 supporters who chanted ' @entity42 ! @entity42 ! ' in honour of their new £ 60m acquisition			2
welcome to @entity62 : @entity13 ( bottom ) wins his first @entity65 free - kick after 12 mins @entity13 's influence into the match grew as @entity4 weathered the opening 10 - minute storm from @entity70 's side who pressed and pressurised the visitor 's shaky defence			2
the midfielder 's move to the @entity23 broke the @entity77 transfer record fee and @entity4 supporters got their first insight into why their club paid a premium price to acquire @entity13 's talents on 14 minutes			1
collecting the ball on the half - way line , @entity13 sprayed a beautiful 40 - yard pass into the path of @entity87 who saw his shot saved by @entity90			0
ping : @entity13 almosts assisted after 14 minutes when he played a delightful 40 - yard pass to @entity21 at real last season , the @entity93 created the most assists in @entity97 's top five leagues with 17 , and the vision he showed to pick out @entity87 was evident in what was the move of the match			1
that pass was one of 33 he attempted on his debut at @entity19 , and the midfielder soon once again neatly linked up with @entity87 to create another opening for @entity107 's side			0
sharing is caring : @entity13 attempted 33 passes during his 69 minute showing at @entity19 surging down the left flank , he performed a one - two with @entity87 , flicking the ball to the @entity113 , before crossing to @entity114 who slipped just as he was about to shoot from 10 yards out			2
playing nominally in the heart of @entity4 's midfield there were times however when @entity13 struggled to cope with his defensive duties			2
primarily brought in as an attack - minded player the former @entity17 galactico lost half of his personal duels when challenging for the ball			0
getting stuck in : @entity13 ( right ) tackles @entity126 ( left ) for the ball in midfield role reversal : @entity13 ( top ) is dispossesed by @entity131 ( bottom ) in the first - half on saturday blank canvas : @entity13 failed to register any tackles , clearances or blocks during the match vs @entity33 he failed to register any tackles , clearances or blocks and was at fault for man - of - the - match @entity144 ' blistering volley that @entity145 did well to tip over for a corner in the first - half			2
@entity107 did n't buy @entity13 for his defensive abilities though and the @entity113 must find a way to utilise his new signing 's main assets in a different way - be it with a change of formation perhaps as his winless start in the @entity4 hotseat continues			2
for @entity17 and @entity42 - @entity13 shone in a 4 - 3 - 3 formation drifting out to the left - hand side during matches from his central role and his most destructive work for @entity4 came in the second - half doing just that but in @entity107 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
marauder : @entity167 's heat map shows @entity13 did most of his work down the left - hand side for @entity4 on 52 minutes he gave the @entity33 defence a warning of his speed , providing @entity20 an overlap before seeing his drive blocked by @entity175			1
six minutes later the 26 - year - old showed his blistering pace out - muscling and out - sprinting @entity175 down the left flank before his ricocheted cross found @entity20			1
the newly - appointed @entity62 captain 's mishit effort fell back to @entity87 who saw his deflected left - footed volley cleared off the line by @entity126			0
denied : @entity13 's ( top ) one shot in the match was blocked by @entity175 ( bottom ) expensive taste : @entity13 's £ 60m to @entity4 broke a @entity77 record transfer fee shortly after that thrilling burst though , @entity13 's afternoon was ended when he was replaced by @entity191 on 69 minutes			1
moments before that the @entity65 's most expensive player went down with cramp much to the worry with everyone connected to the club			0
@entity107 later confirmed that his latest signing was taken off as a precaution after taking a kick to his calf			0
impressive viewing : @entity22 ( third left ) will have been pleased with @entity13 's debut at @entity19 down and out ? @entity13 ( left ) had to be substituted after 69 minutes after taking a kick to his calf overall @entity13 's performance was the only real positive for @entity4 as they struggled to break down @entity65 new boys @entity33			1
his industrious display mixed with his unquestionable quality will be a welcome addition to @entity4 as they look to rebuild from last season 's disastrous campaign			0
it 's clear that @entity4 have problems elsewhere though and @entity107 has until the transfer window closes on september 1 to address these problems			0
if not , then the qualities of @entity13 may not get to be displayed at the @entity23 as often as @entity4 supporters will wish for			0
encouraging start : @entity4 fans will be hoping @entity13 can kick on after making his debut for the club			0

@entity5 played well as @entity4 struggled at @entity33
@entity13 started for @entity4 at 0 - 0 draw at @entity19 on saturday
@entity42 international was deployed in centre - midfield in @entity22 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation
26 - year - old showed glimpses of his talent with some great passes and direct running
he created pass of the match for @entity21 after 14 minutes
his debut ended on 69 minutes after taking a kick to his calf
