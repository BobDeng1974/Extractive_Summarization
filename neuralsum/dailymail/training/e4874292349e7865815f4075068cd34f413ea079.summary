a judicial review application submitted by @entity2 convicted drug traffickers @entity3 and @entity4 could lead to a window of opportunity for the pair who have been sentenced to execution			1
despite the @entity14 attorney general 's former claims that the appeal would be rejected on tuesday due to there being only one exhausted entitlement for judicial review , the @entity11 chief , judge @entity10 , is yet to make a decision on the matter			1
' there is no difficulty			0
we just have to look at all the regulations , including the @entity27 decision , the @entity29 decree as well as the joint decision that was made in january , ' mr @entity10 said on tuesday , rather than dismissing the appeal , @entity23 reports			0
' anyone who studies the facts in the case of @entity4 and @entity3 would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals			1
in fact because of the @entity14 penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping @entity14			2
it simply makes no sense now to kill them , ' mr @entity38 told @entity23 the sliver of hope comes after it was revealed on monday that the @entity58 pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions			1
the pair , who have been on death row since 2006 , could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the @entity14 government on drug cases			1
' there is no difficulty			0
we just have to look at all the regulations , including the @entity27 decision , the @entity29 decree as well as the joint decision that was made in january , ' mr @entity10 said on tuesday , rather than dismissing the appeal according to @entity76 and @entity3 will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at @entity80 in @entity81 and flown to @entity82			2
from there they will take a five - hour journey through the villages of @entity87 before they arrive at the port of @entity90			0
the men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters , where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on @entity96			0
from there the @entity2 men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island , where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners			0
@entity96 is where the @entity105 bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago			2
meanwhile appeals for the two men 's lives continue to be made , the latest of which has come from a @entity114 band known as one of the @entity14 president 's favourites			1
@entity119 's lead singer @entity118 penned a letter to @entity121 asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers @entity119 's lead singer @entity118 penned a letter to @entity121 asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers and posting the open letter to the band 's facebook page last month , for their 729,000 followers to read			1
mr @entity121 is said to be a big fan of metal , and recently revealed in an interview that he discovered the genre when he stumbled across a thrash metal band gig when he was just 14 years old			2

' as a follower of our band @entity119 , you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world , whether it comes from a state or as an individual			1

if these things are not challenged and ultimately changed , i believe we will never truly move forward as humankind			0
i understand that you are standing as a leader determined to change things for the better , and so i believe granting clemency would be a major step forward in this pursuit of betterment			0
i appreciate that heroin can be damaging on many levels , but i believe that this is a much deeper issue that can not be changed or altered by simply taking away the lives of people			0
again , i respectfully ask that you make a real difference and overturn these sentences			0
in hope and peace , @entity118 ( @entity119 ) ' if these things are not challenged and ultimately changed , i believe we will never truly move forward as humankind , ' the post continued			2
