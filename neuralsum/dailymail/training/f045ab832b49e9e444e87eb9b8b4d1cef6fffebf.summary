by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin the first test at @entity2 provided plenty of material for both sides of the @entity6			1
if you think the new era is a land of milk and honey , you ’ll have gone home cuddling your positives			2
and if you regard the @entity14 and @entity15 as devils incarnate , you ’ll be smugly shaking your head			2
the truth is somewhere in the middle			2
for while there were moments when @entity15 ’s captaincy reverted to the type we winced at in @entity26 , the fact remains that @entity27 almost took seven wickets after tea on one of the flattest surfaces in the world game			1
oh , and it turned into an amazing game of cricket – a nine - down special which @entity27 , as if attempting to keep @entity35 alive all by themselves , seem to produce about once a year			1
ca n't believe it ! @entity39 and @entity27 came within a whisker of winning the first test against @entity42 contrast : @entity45 ( left ) and @entity46 fist bump after guiding the tourists to a draw at @entity2 of course , some perceptions refuse to be altered by the facts			1
@entity27 ’s first innings rattled along at 4.4 runs an over , their fastest run - rate in a test innings of 40 overs or more since @entity58 ’s bowlers kept laying out buffets in 2011			1
yet still some called it boring			2
then there was @entity27 ’s second innings , condemned in some quarters as the period of the game which cost them the chance of victory			1
arriving at the ground that day , @entity69 tweeted his wish : a lead of 380 by stumps			0
despite this , others argued that @entity27 should have declared earlier , and that @entity15 ’s desire to allow @entity77 to complete a maiden test hundred obscured the team goal			1
it is an argument that ignores a couple of important points			0
the first is that @entity27 spent much of the fourth afternoon trying to prevent their collapse of 6 for 75 from turning into something terminal			1
@entity46 ’s probing spell earned @entity42 the right to scupper an early declaration			1
it was n’t until the final few overs of the day that @entity77 felt comfortably about hitting out			2
if @entity15 had given himself half an hour to bowl at @entity42 on the fourth evening , the target would have closer to 330 – not inconceivable on a surface that remained flat and with @entity95 batting like @entity96			1
the chances are that @entity42 would have been only three down at tea on the final day in any case			1
and it was a minor miracle that @entity27 came so close to forcing a win			1
but , yes , there were issues too			0
@entity15 ’s field placings on the fourth morning , when @entity27 needed three quick wickets to cement their huge first - innings advantage , smacked of a team that had not yet got the @entity109 whitewash out of their systems			1
@entity15 began with four men on the fence for @entity113 , and later increased that to five			0
as @entity115 pointed out , boundary fielders are not necessarily a problem – so long as attacking fielders are in place too			0
yet @entity113 twice nibbled @entity119 between keeper and a floating slip for four			1
the field was not so much in - out as shake - it - all - about			0
the last hour also included a couple of curious calls			0
why give an over to @entity128 , which for a minute or two took the sting out of the situation ? and why bring on @entity132 for the ante - penultimate over when this was precisely the kind of scenario beloved of @entity39 ? we should n’t be shocked by these quibbles ( though the over-rate from both sides was appalling ) : @entity15 will never wake up to discover he is @entity140			1
and at least he showed willing while setting an 8 - 1 off - side field on monday afternoon – even if he later admitted the idea was @entity119 ’s			1
pumped up : @entity119 was in devastating form for @entity27 in the final session on the fifth day for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin besides which , there was plenty at @entity2 to enthuse about			1
@entity77 conveyed a rare kind of calm for a 24 - year - old in only his second test , and @entity155 batted with assured elegance in the first innings			2
@entity128 ’s double - hundred , meanwhile , has glossed over his winter travails			0
yes , the attack lacks a proper spinner - @entity27 must hope @entity161 gets his act together for the arrival of @entity58 - but @entity164 took five wickets in his first test , and @entity132 ’s impression of a battering ram ought to receive its due on a more conducive pitch			1
@entity27 began the test ready to be written off as a rabble , and came within an inside edge of pulling off one of their most memorable wins for years			1
it ’s not a bad start			0
that 's better : @entity15 tried to think up some more imaginative fields as the hosts searched for wickets @entity180 everyone knew what he meant , but that did n’t stop @entity155 ’s assessment of @entity185 , his fellow @entity35 debutant , making an early bid for @entity188 slip of the year			0
‘ i do n’t think of @entity185 as an @entity26 , ’ said @entity155 of the @entity190 - born opening batsman ahead of the @entity192 ’s test against @entity42			1
‘ i just think of him as a normal person			0
’ it ’s the kind of accommodating approach @entity27 ’s new era is crying out for			1
. person ! @entity155 ( right ) claimed he does n't see @entity26 debutant @entity185 as an @entity26 @entity200 should be careful			2
not only is he in danger of getting picked for the one - day series against @entity58 later this summer on account of being one of the cleanest hitters in the land , but he has also been shredding his reputation as a white - ball specialist			0
sent to @entity209 ( and , briefly , @entity210 ) after averaging under 14 in the 2013 @entity211 , @entity200 has been causing a stir back in @entity214 ’s first - class colours , smashing 167 off 133 balls against @entity216 , then 96 off 110 against @entity217			0
much more of this and the selectors may be left with no choice but to accept he is indeed capable of batting in innings that last more than 20 overs			0
blasting : @entity200 has been in sensational form for @entity214 in all formats of the county game a fortnight at the @entity229 not so long ago provided a reminder that no cricket nation lives in hope so eternally as @entity233			2
the expectations are so very real – and the inevitable disappointment is so utterly crushing			0
but captain @entity237 is made of sterner stuff , subjecting his troops to classes from a ‘ life success coach ’ and calling for more eloquent ‘ body language ’			0
and what have his team learned ? ‘ we have learned that in @entity246 , you have to play good cricket for 100 overs			0
you ca n't win by just playing well for two hours			2
’ there should be no stopping them now			0
cricketers , heal thyselves do the players know the laws ? @entity42 ’s captain @entity113 felt @entity255 did n’t realise he was not out after the ball cannoned off a glove unattached to the bat handle and was caught down the leg side by @entity260 in the final over of last night ’s thriller at @entity2			1
this is amazing on two counts			0
@entity266 , it ’s hardly one of cricket ’s more obscure laws			2
two , it suggests he does n’t own the dvd of the 2005 ashes , in which @entity272 is given out by @entity273 at the end of the @entity276 nail - biter in the same circumstances			0
a couple of winters ago , @entity278 trudged off in a @entity35 in @entity281 after he was caught by @entity282 at silly point			0
but the ball had nestled in @entity282 ’s grasp only after ricocheting off the helmet – not out , in other words			0
yet neither men knew the law			0
is it time @entity35 cricketers were given a crash course ? thinking man : @entity233 captain @entity237 has been passing on pearls of wisdom to his players			2

@entity27 drew the first test against @entity42 at @entity2
@entity39 and @entity119 were n't able to force final wicket
@entity255 should be sent on a laws of the game crash course
