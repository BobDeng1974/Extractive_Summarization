by @entity0 a @entity1 has been wrecked by a lightning bolt just days after it was introduced			1
the $ 1,000 machine was the first in its state when it went into service with much fanfare two weeks ago at a used books and music store in @entity10 , @entity11			1
but only about a dozen people bought any of the virtual ' crypto - currency ' before nature intervened - striking @entity14 and creating a power surge on friday			1
out of service : this @entity1 , pictured during its launch last week on a local tv station , has been knocked out of action after lightning struck the used books and music store which hosted it in @entity10 , @entity11 devastated : @entity24 , the founder of @entity25 , insisted no accounts were compromised			1
mr @entity24 is pictured during the launch of the automated teller on local network @entity29 now last week since then the machine has been out of action and its owner @entity24 is devastated			1
the entrepreneur , who founded the machine 's owner @entity25 , had hoped the teller would prompt a digital currency revolution in the southern state			1
he told @entity38 : ' it 's kind of like getting punched in the face			2
i 'm trying to pick up the pieces , trying to figure out where we are at			1
' to use the machine , which mr @entity24 hopes to get back up and running within a week , customers had to download a @entity1 app to their phone			1
the app presented them with a qr code which matched up to their unique ' digital wallet ' and simply had to be scanned by the teller to gain access			2
customers then fed dollar bills into the machine to convert them into the currency - which critics warn is highly unstable as it has no centralised controls			1
virtual currency : @entity61 was founded in 2009 using open - source software and has risen hugely in value			2
the ' coins ' pictured - created to popularise the currency - are merely tokens			2
the real value is in the virtual world the virtual money 's value is determined by no government , instead being set by a peer - to - peer network of mainly anonymous users			2
its origins are shrouded in mystery , part of the reason many established investors distrust it			0
the currency was invented by @entity82 in 2009 but that is not his real name - he was anonymous			2
the inventor released the coding for his currency in open - source form , and users can now create their own bitcoins			2
this happens through a process called mining , which forces computers to solve algorithms so complex that the amount of power they take up limits how much currency can flood the market			0
its value works just like any undefinable commodity , with the same potential pitfalls			0
in one of the most famous price bubbles , tulips took on enormous value in 17th @entity110 with lovers of the flowers remortgaging their houses before the price suddenly collapsed			0
one bitcoin is worth around $ 580 , but most of the customers in @entity10 withdrew only small amounts			1
for the one customer who bought an entire @entity1 , mr @entity24 had to abandon his normal process and conduct the sale using laptops , according to @entity38			1
the lightning bolt prompted amused reactions on @entity61 forums			0
one lover of the virtual currency wrote : ' that 's it boys , @entity1 is done			1
@entity130 has weighed in on cryptocurrency and found it not worthy			0
' another put simply : ' i think we can blame the @entity136			0
' mr @entity24 insisted no accounts were compromised by the lightning strike			1
founded in 2009 , the virtual currency has created a small circle of young millionaires who invested early on			0
but it is highly controversial because of its lack of controls and dramatically volatile value			0
its origins in anonymous peer - to - peer networks prompted it to be used on the less respectable side of the web - including the ' @entity153 ' drugs and weapons trading site @entity152			0
@entity61 's price stayed relatively low for its first three years but soared towards the end of last year , making headlines around the world			0
at its peak at the beginning of december , a single @entity1 was worth $ 1,147 - up from $ 13 a year earlier - prompting the launch of an array of trading and analysis sites			1
the price has since stabilised , but the attention enjoyed by the virtual currency also attracted the wrong kind of fans			0
a series of websites reported their @entity61 stores had been raided by hackers as cyber-criminals sought to took advantage of the currency 's raging popularity			2
@entity179 : @entity61 's price rocketed in the last three months of last year , earning it headlines around the world the world 's first @entity1 was launched in october in @entity182 , @entity183 , and more than 100 are thought to have sprung up around the globe since			0
it is now accepted by dozens of firms including @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			0
but regulators in the @entity194 and @entity195 warn the currency 's days as a free - flowing , unmonitored entity are numbered			1
@entity198 , of the @entity199 , told a major summit this month that @entity61 's creators and traders would have to follow rules similar to those faced by banks			0
he said : ' i would urge this industry to work actively to address the concerns of financial authorities rather than " playing cat and mouse " and eventually , and inevitably , being drawn into the regulatory net			0

machine introduced days earlier at used bookshop in @entity10 , @entity11
@entity217 hit $ 1,000 machine on friday after it was used just a dozen times
' i 'm trying to pick up the pieces ' , said the teller 's owner @entity24
one bitcoin is worth almost $ *600* but critics warn the currency is volatile
