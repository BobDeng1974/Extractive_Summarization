@entity0 eased to a 3 - 0 victory against @entity2 at @entity3 on friday night courtesy of a @entity6 strike and goals from centre backs @entity9 and @entity10			1
pre-tournament hysteria was in short supply at @entity3 among the prawn sandwich brigade , with large swathes of empty red spaces among the corporate seats			0
it was a near sell - out elsewhere - although many fans took to making paper aeroplanes during a languid first half			1
the planes raised a cheer when they reached the pitch - @entity24 retrieved one - and the crowd certainly enjoyed it when another one hit a @entity2 player			2
they must have half a chance getting into @entity0 ’s			0
’ that ’s some praise given the @entity49 options of @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0

@entity2 ’s new coach @entity55 had an unbeaten @entity3 record prior to friday night			1
he captained @entity57 here in 1995 in a less than compelling 0 - 0 draw , leading a team that included @entity61 and @entity62			1
that rather uninspiring clash formed part of @entity0 ’s @entity66 preparations under @entity67			0
let ’s hope that , like that year , there are some fireworks when the real business begins			0
one of the best features of @entity74 football - the iconic strip with the distinctive red sash - was sadly not on show last night with @entity0 playing in their all white home kit			2
the sight of @entity80 racing away in the distinctive kit celebrating another goal in the 3 - 1 win over @entity84 in 1978 will always bring a nostalgic smile to @entity0 fans			1
iconic : @entity80 is mobbed by his @entity2 team - mates after scoring against @entity84 at the 1978 @entity88			2

many @entity0 fans took to making paper aeroplanes during 3 - 0 win over @entity2
@entity38 claims @entity41 and @entity40 would go straight into @entity43 team
@entity2 coach @entity55 had an unbeaten @entity3 record prior to *friendly* *defeat*
