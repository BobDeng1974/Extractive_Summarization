by @entity0 a mother - of - four left on the brink of death after a devastating stroke was woken from a coma by her husband playing their favourite wedding songs			1
@entity9 , 48 , suddenly collapsed on her husband @entity11 's 46th birthday in march and suffered a stroke on the way to hospital			1
she was put on a life - support machine and doctors told her family to prepare for the worst			1
@entity9 ( centre ) suffered a stroke while celebrating her husband @entity11 's 46th birthday ( pictured , clockwise from left , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity22 's boyfriend , @entity25 , husband @entity11 and @entity26 ) medics sent scans of her brain to experts at @entity31 and warned she would die if she could not be transferred			1
the @entity33 hospital agreed to admit @entity9 and she was airlifted for last - ditch brain surgery and then put in an induced coma after the two - hour op. doctors weaned off her sedatives over five days but after another two days she was still unconscious and showing little signs of life			1
@entity11 , daughter @entity41 , 20 , and their three sons @entity25 , 18 , @entity43 , 16 and @entity26 , 14 , spent hours at her bedside vainly trying to coax her out of her coma			1
on the seventh day devoted @entity11 then decided to play their two favourite songs , @entity48 by the @entity49 and simply @entity51 , which they danced to at their wedding 21 years ago			1
to his delight within an hour of @entity9 showed the first sign of response , moving her arm and gently nodding			1
over the next two days she began to respond more and opened her eyes on the eighth day of her coma			2
after that she was able to hold a pen and communicate by writing odd words , such as ' @entity60 ' when she wanteda glass of water			0
two weeks after the operation @entity9 started speaking again with her family			1
daughter @entity41 , 20 , said : ' we spent hours talking to her and trying to find anything that we thought would stimulate a response			0
' @entity68 downloaded their wedding songs onto his phone and played them to mum with tears rolling from his face onto hers			1
' this broke my heart but she started to move her right arm and a couple of days after this she started nodding			1
' despite @entity9 's progress doctors have warned her family that she will never fully recover from the crippling stroke			1
@entity11 , a cabbie , said : ' i wanted to try and get some response			2
if anything was going to wake her up then it would be that			2
after seven days doctors told @entity11 to expect the worst , but after he played @entity9 her two favourite wedding songs she showed signs of response and woke up a day later while he was playing the songs mrs @entity9 began moving her arm and then gently nodding , regained consciousness a day later and is now able to write and speak ' after about an hour of playing the song she showed signs of movement			1
i was absolutely delighted , you 're on cloud nine			0
' the doctors then bring you back down to earth when they say that 's as good as it 's going to get			2
' it is life - changing for her and it is life - changing for me			2
to what degree ? i do n't know that at the moment			0
' i ca n't really put into words how i feel			2
she is my life partner , we have had a very close relationship and we have always been together			0
' @entity9 spent two weeks recovering at @entity113 before being returned to @entity114 near her home in @entity116 for a further two weeks			1
she is now an in - patient on a specialist stroke rehab unit at @entity118 and is allowed to return home occasionally for an hour or so			2
however , doctors say @entity9 will now have to live with a disability for the rest of her life			2
she will have limited movement but it is hoped she will be able to walk around her home in @entity126 and retain some of her independence			0
her family are now desperately trying to raise £ 30,000 to convert their home by turning the ground floor into a living space for her with wet room , suitable kitchen and wheelchair access to the garden			0
@entity11 said : ' she gets to see the kids , stroke the dog and see her personal things			2
' her progress is very , very good			0
a few weeks ago she could n't tell the time or remember what i had said to her five minutes earlier			0
while @entity9 is now out of her coma , the stoke has left her disabled and the family are in the process of fining £ 30,000 to covert the bottom floor of their house for her to use ' now she can do that and physically she is getting there , although her left side is very weak			1
' no one has actually said what the prognosis is long term but three medical professionals have each said she is a miracle			0
' he added : '' when she was first taken ill i took the kids in to say goodbye			0
it was one of the worst moments of my life			0
' doctors literally told us to plan for the worst and hope for the best "			2
' @entity41 said : ' the long term goal is that mum will return back where she belongs so that our house once again becomes a home			0
' any donation will be received with true heartfelt thanks and appreciation			0
every day my dad would say to my mum " if you win your battle , then we will win the war "			0
' my mum has done her part in winning the battle so please help us win the war and get her back home where she belongs			0
' a @entity114 spokesman said : ' we are delighted to hear that mrs @entity9 has recovered from her coma and is now doing so well			1
' when she initially came to @entity114 we were very concerned for her welfare and immediately transferred her to @entity192			0
we wish her the very best for the future			0
" a @entity31 spokesman added : ' for @entity9 to awake from her coma after @entity196 played her their wedding songs is a wonderful outcome			1
