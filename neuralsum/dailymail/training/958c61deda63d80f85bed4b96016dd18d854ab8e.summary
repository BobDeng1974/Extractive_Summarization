@entity0 , 81 , who hid a £ 1bn trove of suspected stolen @entity3 art has died in his @entity5 flat a museum in @entity7 today said it has been named the ' unrestricted and unfettered sole heir ' of reclusive art collector @entity0			1
the 81 - year - old son of @entity11 's art dealer , whose collection included many pieces looted by the @entity14 , had made a will shortly before his death yesterday			1
there had already been speculation that the beneficiary was a museum outside of @entity3 , possibly in @entity20 or @entity7			1
but now the @entity21 has announced it is ' surprised and delighted ' to have learned that mr @entity0 's remaining paintings will be left to its collection			1
in a statement it said the appointment brings “ a considerable burden of responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and sensitive kind , and questions in particular of a legal and ethical nature			2
” the museum says it never previously had any dealings with @entity0			1
mr @entity0 died in the @entity5 flat where he kept many of the paintings , which included works by @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 that were either looted or bought from @entity45 at knock - down prices			1
he had been selling them over the years to support himself , until in 2012 @entity49 customs officials swooped and confiscated the collection of 1,400 works			2
authorities kept most , but allowed mr @entity0 to keep hundreds after investigators could find no evidence they were looted			1
with his death , the ownership of those artworks had seemed to have been thrown into doubt			2
but now all eyes are on his final will			2
@entity61 , mr @entity0 's lawyer , told the @entity62 that mr @entity0 wrote the will in the last few weeks			1
' it now falls to the probate court to determine if the will is valid and whether a contract of inheritance exists , ' he said			2
' i can understand that there is now wild speculation , but i do n't want to comment on that at this stage			2
' @entity5 daily @entity73 claimed it had learned that mr @entity0 intended his entire collection to remain together and go to a museum in @entity7 or @entity20 , where he had contacts			1
the paper claimed that authorities in @entity3 were angry the controversial collector had chosen to leave the artworks to a foreign institution			2
the @entity21 in @entity21 , @entity7 : the museum said it has learned it is the ' unrestricted and unfettered sole heir ' of mr @entity0 , who died yesterday at his home in @entity5 , @entity3 mr @entity0 , who had been ill with a heart condition , learnt just two months ago that he would be allowed to keep several hundred paintings after prosecutors said they could find no evidence that they had been looted			1
he claimed all the paintings were legally acquired by his father , but at least 500 were found to have been either stolen by the @entity14 or were strong - armed from @entity45 collectors at rock - bottom prices			2
mr @entity0 ’s father @entity93 was @entity3 ’s leading expert on modern art , personally tasked by @entity11 to sell paintings he despised abroad to help fund the @entity3 ’s war effort			1
however , mr @entity97 secretly kept many of the pictures for himself			0
after the war , he was questioned by the @entity102 ’s ‘ @entity103 ’ unit but never charged with any crimes			0
he lied that the bulk of his collection had been destroyed in the @entity108 bombing of @entity109 in 1945			2
in fact , the artworks survived intact and he passed them on to his son , a lifelong bachelor , who said before his death : ‘ i never loved anything or anybody in life but my paintings			0
’ the collection , which includes works by @entity44 , @entity43 and @entity122 was discovered inside his @entity5 apartment under a new deal with prosecutors , art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen ( pictured , a work by @entity122 ) in 2011 , he was investigated as a possible tax fraudster when he was found with money he could not explain , but investigators later found paintings hidden behind tins of beans and out - of - date food in his flat			1
in february this year , more paintings , worth at least £ 100million , were found in a house he owned in @entity138 , @entity20			0
but a court decided he could get between 300 and 350 paintings back			0
under the terms of deal , the art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry out background checks on each of the paintings			0
at the end of this year any painting which investigators had not finished studying would have been handed back to the 81 - year - old			2
@entity154 state prosecutor @entity153 said at the time : ' we have come across new evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to re-evaluate the legal situation			0
' @entity0 's lawyer @entity162 applauded the decision to release the art , saying : ' it 's a good day for @entity0			1
' the @entity167 government came under fire - especially by families whose relatives were robbed by the @entity14 - for keeping silent for almost two years about the trove of art works			2
@entity0 was arrested in 2012 but it was n't until last year that knowledge of the collection became public			1
separately , representatives for @entity0 later secured a further 238 artworks at a dilapidated house he owned in @entity138 , @entity20			1
@entity0 was never under investigation in @entity20 and those works were n't seized by authorities			1
@entity0 was set to have the paintings returned at the end of the year if investigators could not unearth whether they were stolen ( painting by @entity43 ) one of the pieces of work discovered in his flat was this masterpiece by @entity190 last year it transpired that mr @entity0 had given four of his paintings to his brother - in - law			1
they may also have been looted by the @entity14 , according to the authorities			0
what happens to the artwork now remains to be seen			0
it could go to mr @entity0 's younger sister , @entity199 , but she would have to be named in a will - and such a document has yet to surface			1
@entity202 , director and @entity204 , told @entity205 : ' it 's a pretty murky situation			0
we do n't know if he left a will			0
if his lawyers were smart they would have cleared up the issue in advance			0
it 'll get cleared up over the next couple of days			0
' one of the works of art in the trove - a @entity43 valued at up to £ 60million - has been claimed by the ex-wife of @entity219			0
sitting woman is thought to have belonged to @entity222 ’s maternal grandfather , the late @entity223 art dealer @entity221			0
mr @entity202 is representing the @entity221 family and added that he 's confident it will be returned to them			0
he said that a second claim for the painting had ' been dispensed with '			0
@entity0 stayed out of sight after news of his collection broke , barely talking to media , and was apparently overwhelmed by the publicity			1
in january , his representatives said they were considering claims for some of the works and that he was seeking ‘ fair and just solutions ’ to the case			0
‘ so much has happened in the past weeks and months , and is still happening , ’ he wrote on a newly created website shortly afterward			0
‘ i only wanted to live with my pictures , in peace and calm			0
’ @entity0 was born in @entity244 in 1932 and came from a prominent @entity167 family of artists , composers and collectors , but little is known about his life beyond his position as the heir of his father @entity93 's art collection			1
when @entity256 investigators questioned @entity257 after the end of @entity259 about the origins of his collection , they were doubtful whether all the pieces really belonged to him but eventually decided that he was the rightful owner of most of them			2
after his father 's 1956 death in a car accident , @entity0 lived together with his mother in @entity5 until she died in 1968			1
he reportedly lived a reclusive life , making a living by selling paintings from time to time			0
experts who examined the pieces seized in @entity5 said they included both ‘ degenerate art ’ and looted art. in the frame : a painting by @entity167 artist @entity276 called @entity277 ( two @entity278 ) , which was found at @entity0 's house remarkable : a formerly unknown painting of @entity223 artist @entity281 was found at @entity0 's apartment @entity283 in @entity284 ( 1751/1800 ) by @entity285 the @entity14 took so - called degenerate art - mostly avant - garde modern art , such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the @entity167 people			1
looted art was stolen or bought for a pittance from @entity45 collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the @entity3			0
for the heirs of those collectors , the discovery raised hopes of recovering art , but the slow release of information by the @entity167 government stirred frustration			0
after much back and forth , @entity0 eventually agreed last month to a deal with the @entity167 government , under which hundreds of works owned by the collector would be checked for a @entity3 - era past while staying in government hands			1
displayed : @entity314 's ' @entity313 , les bras releves , les mains croisees @entity311 ' ( undated ) nine hundred and seventy of the works were believed to have been confiscated , stolen or looted by the @entity14			0
pictured is @entity321 's @entity320 ( ' the @entity322 ' , 1926 ) the works were first discovered in 2012			0
pictured is @entity321 's child at the table the remarkable find was first revealed in @entity3 's @entity328			0
pictured is @entity331 's @entity330 ( ' @entity332 ' , about 1840 ) sketch : @entity335 's @entity334 ( undated ) prosecutors who initially confiscated all the works of art they found at his apartment then announced that they were releasing the rest of the collection			1
@entity0 's lawyers had argued that the prosecutors acted disproportionately in seizing the entire collection , and that the art was n't relevant as evidence for prosecutors ' suspicion of import tax evasion			1
@entity351 , @entity3 's culture minister , said on tuesday that @entity0 's decision to work with authorities deserved ‘ recognition and respect			1
’ ‘ it will remain to @entity0 's credit that he ... sent an exemplary signal for the search for fair and just solutions with this avowal of moral responsibility , ’ she said .			2

@entity0 , 81 , died at apartment in @entity365 , @entity5 , yesterday
with no close relatives , the future of his collection had been in doubt
but a museum in @entity373 has announced it is sole beneficiary of his estate
