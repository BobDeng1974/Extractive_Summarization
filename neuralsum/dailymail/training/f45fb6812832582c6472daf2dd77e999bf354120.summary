delete ! the president regularly talked to @entity4 during his 2008 campaign ... this is no longer likely to be the case taking a shot : @entity4 criticised president @entity1 after being a long time supporter his summary of the past four years is equally scathing : ' give the bond markets what they want , bail out the reckless so long as they are also rich , use fiscal and monetary stimulus to make up for the absence of any consequential broadening of economic and educational opportunity , sweeten the pill of disempowerment with a touch of tax fairness , even though the effect of any such tax reform is sure to be modest			1
' making enemies : @entity1 has lost a respected adviser @entity4 most of mr @entity4 's comments seem to be politically to the left of mr @entity1 , but he insists that the @entity43 would be no more destructive than the @entity81 as ' the risk of military adventurism ' would remain the same			1
