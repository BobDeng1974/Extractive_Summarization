the inquisitive creature was captured clambering down a tree and calmly *crawling* over the beach to the shoreline
the koala appeared not to be startled by the audience gathered to watch , and sat looking at the waves breaking on the shores
it is *unusual* behaviour for a koala , but not *unheard* of , as koalas are naturally inquisitive
@entity8 has a healthy population of koalas which are *frequent* sited
