dangerous : @entity0 ' start your senses ' @entity2 toy has been withdrawn from sale thousands of baby toys are being recalled from @entity8 stores and homes because they include a colour dye that is considered a cancer risk			1
the ‘ @entity19 ’ is sold as an educational toy on the basis that it ‘ helps develop baby ’s senses of sight , hearing , and touch ’			2
it has been available from leading retailers including @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , which have all issued a product recall and advised parents to return or destroy it			1
the product includes a teether , mirror , rattle , crinkle paper and ribbons , while the highly coloured toy is designed to be attached to buggies and cots			2
however , it has emerged that the award winning product sold under the @entity0 brand contains a colour including the chemical 4 - @entity43 , also known as @entity45			2
it is a yellow dye used in computer printers , insecticides , paint and varnishes , however it is toxic and a cancer risk with the result it is prohibited from products that might be chewed by babies			1
in 1981 , a criminal gang in @entity58 sold huge quantities of olive oil containing the chemical in a catastrophic food fraud that left 20,000 sick and 400 dead			1
a warning poster in @entity23 and other supermarkets advises parents to ‘ stop using this product immediately ’			1
it adds : ‘ if you have a @entity0 ‘ @entity19 ’ with the code ‘ q ’ followed by a four digit number , please stop using it and destroy immediately			1
' a scientist at @entity75 - based company @entity74 , which develops products using safer chemicals , was not surprised the product was recalled			0
technical director , dr @entity78 , said : ‘ overall , as the @entity79 has classified this as a group 2 carcinogen - it suggests that it is possible to be carcinogenic to humans via ingestion or contact with skin			0
‘ in the case of this toy , the dye will probably be pretty well fixed into the fibres			1
therefore any exposure to unfixed dyestuff and hence a carcinogen would be small – although any exposure is a risk that most people would not want to take			2
’ at risk : babies could have been infected with the yellow dye , which killed 400 in @entity58 in 1981 supermarkets including @entity23 warned parents : ' please stop using it and destroy it immediately ' the website @entity105 issues alerts and information on products that have been recalled because they may be dangerous			1
it warned that it will be difficult to get all the toys back			2
spokesman , @entity112 , said : ‘ the purpose of a product recall is to remove known safety issues from products that have been sold to consumers			0
‘ many recalls have a success rate of only 10 - 20per cent , meaning that 80 - 90per cent of products , with known safety issues , remain in consumers ’ homes years after the recalls were launched			0
‘ the consequences of these failures are many more fires , injuries and deaths than would be the case if the recalls had been successful			0
‘ the biggest challenge facing most recalls is that manufacturers often do not know who owns their products			0
this is a serious issue as the most effective communication tactic used by manufacturers is to write to the owners of affected products			0
’ the firm behind the brand and toy is @entity143 , an @entity144 company which describes itself as the world ’s fastest growing baby product companies with global sales of 22.8milllion products			0
parents were advised to contact the @entity8 office of the company , @entity151 , which is based in @entity152 , @entity153 , for a refund .			0
