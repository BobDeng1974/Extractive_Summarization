voters who back @entity2 at the next election risk ' going to bed with @entity5 and waking up with @entity6 ' , @entity0 has warned			1
the prime minister said the next election would be a ' straight fight ' between @entity10 and the @entity11 , and a vote for @entity2 made it more likely that @entity6 becomes prime minister in 2015			1
the jibe came just hours before former @entity17 donor @entity16 announced he was handing £ 1million to @entity2 , in protest at being dismissed as a ' nobody ' by senior conservative @entity20			1
but hours after mr @entity0 's attack in his conference speech , millionaire @entity17 party donor mr @entity16 announced he was donating £ 1million to @entity2			1
the move came after the @entity11 were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers @entity33 and @entity34			0
the pair were also joined by @entity38 's former deputy @entity37 mayor @entity36			0
but mr @entity0 insisted that a vote for @entity2 would only make a @entity10 government more likely			1
he told the @entity17 conference : '' let 's be clear			2
this is a straight fight			0
it does n't matter whether @entity45 is hung , drawn or quartered , there is only one real choice			0
' the conservatives or @entity10			2
me in @entity49 , or @entity6 in @entity49			2
' if you vote @entity2 – that 's really a vote for @entity10			1
' he went on : ' here 's a thought : on 7th may you could go to bed with @entity5 , and wake up with @entity6			0
i do n't know about you but not one bit of that works for me			0
' so this is the big question for that election			0
on the things that matter in your life , who do you really trust ? ' when it comes to your job , do you trust @entity10 – who wrecked our economy – or the @entity17 , who have made this one of the fastest - growing economies in the @entity73 ? ' when it comes to @entity77 's future , who do you trust ? @entity10 – the party of something - for - nothing , and human wrongs under the banner of human rights , or the @entity17 – who believe in something for something , and reward for hard work ? ' @entity2 leader @entity5 said the @entity11 were paying for insulting @entity2 supporters like multi-millionaire @entity16 ( right ) who upped his donation to @entity2 to £ 1million mr @entity0 's remarks came mr @entity16 , who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the @entity17 , announced today that he was switching his allegiance to @entity2			1
he initially said he was going to give the party £ 100,000			0
but last night he announced he was handing the party £ 1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a ' nobody ' by @entity20			1
mr @entity20 - the @entity97 - dismissed the importance of mr @entity16 ' defection yesterday morning			1
he said : ' i 've never heard of him so we are not going to get too upset about that			0
it 's certainly not going to overshadow the prime minister 's speech today that someone we have n't heard of has gone to @entity2			1
' the remarks infuriated mr @entity16 , causing him to increase his planned donation to @entity2			1
the joke was captured in this photograph of the autocue , after mr @entity0 rejected the idea of following mr @entity6 to deliver his speech from memory speaking to reporters last night he said : ' in light of that and in view of the fact that i am a strong advocate of leaving the @entity120 , i 've decided to donate £ 1million to the party and not the £ 100,000 originally agreed			1
' he added : ' mr @entity20 will now know who i am			0
' mr @entity5 said the donation had capped a ' remarkable week ' for @entity2 following mr @entity34 's defection on saturday			2
he also lashed out at the personal attacks directed against @entity2 during the @entity17 party conference in @entity127			2
the @entity2 threat has sparked an angry torrent of abuse against mr @entity5 's party at the @entity17 conference in @entity127 this week			2
@entity38 accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former chancellor @entity138 said the party 's supporters were ' grumpy old men ' who had led ' disappointing lives '			0
mr @entity0 , meanwhile , attacked mr @entity34 for betraying the hard work of ordinary @entity17 activists which had got his ' fat arse ' into the @entity97 .			0

prime minister warns there is a ' straight choice ' between him or @entity6
a vote for @entity2 makes a @entity10 government more likely in 2015 , he says
hours after attack , @entity17 donor @entity16 handed @entity2 £ 1million
banks upped his donation after @entity20 branded him a ' nobody '
