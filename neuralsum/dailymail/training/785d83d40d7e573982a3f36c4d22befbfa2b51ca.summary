by professor @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 22 june 2013 today we are familiar with our continents being scattered across the globe , but 250 million years ago they were part of one ' supercontinent '			1
here tv geologist professor @entity0 tells how the history of the ' supercontinent ' is responsible for koalas being native only to @entity12 and llamas to only @entity14 , but also , most importantly , how the ' supercontinent ' brought about the invention of sex ... we geologists are an odd bunch			1
we travel through lands that do n't exist			2
the gateway to these imagined lands are the rocks underfoot			2
they are portals to the past			2
no need for a @entity28 or fancy time machine - just a hand lens and a hammer can teleport us back to ancient geological times			2
the ancestral earths we geologists inspect are very different from the familiar geography of the present			2
today , our great land masses are scattered across the globe , but repeatedly in our planet 's history they have clumped together as vast agglomerations - supercontinents			1
supercontinents come together every 500 million years or so , as armadas of land assemble , weld , founder and disperse			2
the most recent great continental union occurred 250 million years ago			2
@entity48 holds 50 per cent of the world 's lithium which was created by the uplift of the @entity60 geologists give it the name @entity64 , meaning ' all @entity65 ' , but it lasted only 100 million years			1
its break - up would give us the scattered continents of today			2
but more than that , the rise and fall of @entity64 would shape our modern world in the most surprising ways			2
for a start , the continental couplings that first gave birth to @entity64 played a critical role in one of the most important evolutionary developments in the story of life - the invention of sexual intercourse			0
the evidence is preserved in the walls of one of the planet 's geological wonders , the @entity89			1
the strata in this gorge span more than a billion years of time , but it is the uppermost rock layers that track the slow death of an ancient ocean as continents coalesced			0
the grey muds of shallow seas , then coastal deltas pass up into the distinctive red sands of continental @entity64			0
among the windblown ripples are footprints which showed that some critters thrived in this new arid wasteland			0
not amphibians , which up until this point had been the dominant animals on the planet			0
professor @entity0 crosses the @entity112 river in @entity113 , one of @entity116 's great rivers and a place where you can find clues to how the @entity121 mountain range was formed a clue to why the ancestors of alligators and crocodiles quickly adapted to the vast @entity64 desert lies in the way they have sex			1
now , gator sex is pretty much like human sex ; a tad more brutish and noisy perhaps , but with the same style of copulation - internal fertilisation			1
for amphibians , fertilisation is a messy and haphazard business involving eggs being released in rivers and ponds			0
in reptiles , the sperm is delivered inside the female direct to the ova			0
the embryos grow within protective shells filled with life - sustaining amniotic juices			0
young reptiles did n't need external water to develop			0
the hard , impermeable egg was the revolution			0
it was the great @entity64 desert that kick - started an evolutionary chain reaction that would lead , eventually , to us			0
the @entity89 reveals that 300 million years ago the @entity154 was the western edge of a vast desert			0
the image shows 1.2 billion years of history at the @entity89 being unveiled in the morning sun mammals would evolve to take those life - supporting fluids inside their bodies and supply nutrition through a placenta , but we 're still children of that first amniotic reptile			1
@entity64 , or rather its demise , is responsible for the survival one of our favourite animals , the koala , in an extremely fortunate way			2
two hundred and one million years ago - the date is now quite specific - @entity64 began to break up			0
huge splits tore at its centre , and its mosaic of land masses began to unravel and separate			0
first , @entity14 eased away from @entity179			1
later , giant splits set loose the combined bulk of @entity182 and @entity12			1
@entity0 gets up close and personal with a living link to @entity64 times			1
alligators are the closest living relative to the reptiles that roamed the land 300 million years ago			0
these ­ reptiles thrived because of an evolutionary advance we have all inherited ­ - internal fertilisation professor @entity0 with a koalla at @entity194 , @entity195			1
he discovers the kaola is n't a bear at all - it 's bear like face is a direct consequence of the movement of the @entity12 continent released from @entity64 , the conjoined twins of @entity182 and @entity12 were a single southern expanse of lush forest - an ark of biodiversity adrift in the southern ocean			1
but their union lasted only until around 90 million years ago , when the first tensions appeared			0
the divorce , when it finally happened , saw a rift send @entity12 north into ever drier environments , while @entity182 was left to languish in polar isolation			1
life aboard these two giant crustal rafts was destined for very different fates			0
while cold and ice gradually claimed the flourishing forests of @entity182 , fire and drought devastated @entity12 's rich cargo of life			1
but for one unlikely animal , @entity12 's climatic transformation was salvation			1
the koala has a remarkably small brain , which perhaps explains why early on in its evolution it made a dumb decision , striking an exclusive partnership with one type of tree			0
@entity236 trees have leaves that are almost devoid of nourishment , which is why koalas are basically cuddly chewing machines , constantly consuming eucalyptus leaves to survive			2
professor @entity0 with a baby llama , in @entity51			1
llamas are a clue to the final act in the geological story of the @entity248 ­ - they originated in @entity249 and only came south when the two landmasses joined three million years ago @entity0 in the @entity121 - mountains that were formed as @entity252 collided with the rest of the continent			1
this was a key step in the formation of @entity116 the eucalyptus tree turned out to be perfectly suited to the parched , flammable conditions that crept over @entity12			1
and so rather than being an evolutionary dead - end , the koala thrived			0
conservationists may argue just how well koalas are doing today but , compared to the other creatures they shared the southern @entity64 forests with , they are sitting pretty			2
@entity267 are other cuddly animals who have benefited from continental drift in a surprising @entity271 times the llama has been the heart of @entity60 culture - the animal 's wool , meat , even blood all highly prized			2
these animals are magnificently adapted to the thin air of the high @entity60 mountains , with supersized hearts and lungs , and arteries packed with oxygen - enriched blood			0
but there is something surprising about this iconic @entity14 animal			1
llamas are n't from this continent at all			1
they evolved in the low plains of @entity249			0
@entity0 with an ammonite fossil he found in the @entity112 river in @entity113			1
this is evidence that the @entity121 , the highest mountains in the world , once formed the bottom of an ocean at the summit of the volcanic island of @entity300 @entity0 reveals the process that built @entity116 and will one bring all the @entity65 's contents together to form one vast ' supercontinent ' three million years ago , when the decoupled halves of the @entity248 finally fused , a great exchange of animal life crossed the narrow land bridge of @entity308			1
along with the llamas , nearly half of @entity14 's animals emigrated from the north			1
geologists call it the @entity315 , but it was a rather one - side swapsie			0
few of the @entity14 species - heavily adapted to @entity320 rainforest - fancied the harsher , colder conditions that awaited them north of @entity322			1
the rejoining of the @entity248 was the final major installment in the coming together of the familiar world we know today			0
populating that world would begin with a bunch of homo sapiens leaving @entity179 just 150,000 years ago			0
as modern humans spread across the globe , civilisation took root in each of the far - flung land masses			0
today , a great global economy binds all the disparate continents together			0
in essence we 've created a new @entity64 - a @entity64 of our own making			0
professor @entity0 's series on plate tectonics , @entity54 , is showing on @entity56 at 9pm on sundays .			1

professor @entity0 is presenting a @entity56 *documentary* about the @entity65 's history and how all the continent were once part of one ' supercontinent '
tells how the ' supercontinent ' is responsible for koalas being native only to @entity12 , and llamas to @entity14 , as well as how sex was invented
