@entity0 claimed the @entity1 would aid @entity3 's development but it seems the @entity4 have already benefited from the competition after just one fixture			1
dispatching of @entity9 with an impressive 4 - 1 victory , optimism is sky high once more			1
thursday night ’s clash felt more like a celebration of @entity3 ’s return to @entity16 football rather than the tough @entity18 fixture it had been billed as			1
such was the ease of the win , each goal and attack felt almost like a showreel of the memorable moments @entity25 will hope to witness this term against the continent ’s best sides			0
we 've done it , @entity31 : @entity32 celebrates with @entity33 after he scored a penalty in the 48th minute sealed with a kiss : @entity36 embraces @entity33 after the defender netted from the penalty spot follow all the latest # @entity1 action on : - @entity41 - @entity40 - @entity43 - @entity42 - website - @entity44 to add to the magic and nostalgia a night game on @entity48 brings , the @entity3 have installed brand new floodlights which certainly boosted the atmosphere – @entity16 football had officially returned to @entity52			1
however , with all the excitement @entity3 left back @entity54 - closing in on full fitness having broken his leg in january – appeared to arrive at the ground late			2
cue mad panic from one particular steward who frantically attempted to get the wideman seated and primed for the action			0
had the @entity63 turned up two minutes late for @entity3 's previous home game - against @entity65 - he 'd have missed the current @entity67 leaders opening two goals ! one man who was on time was @entity72 @entity71 , sat in the @entity73 stand to watch his former club @entity9			1
leaving with five minutes to go , the @entity75 will be disappointed to have missed @entity77 ’s consolation free - kick			0
down and out : @entity9 were put to the sword by @entity3 in thursday night 's @entity1 fixture net gains : @entity36 scores from close range to double @entity3 's advantage at @entity52 @entity3 's ability to make top - class opposition look so ordinary was hugely impressive and the performance felt like the start of something big for the blue half of @entity48			1
the @entity4 certainly hit top gear on their ‘ @entity90 ’ and manager @entity0 will be confident his side can go far in this season 's tournament			1
there was an expectancy the @entity4 would deliver as soon as the first few corners and free - kicks were met with that famous @entity52 roar			0
there was a definite buzz in the air as @entity3 marked their return to @entity16 football in style			1
however , while @entity3 deserved their victory , it was a bizarre match			2
despite seeing their side score four goals , @entity4 fans picked goalkeeper @entity111 as their @entity112			0
it was one of those games ; open for the majority but it has to be noted the @entity3 ’ win was never in doubt at any point during the game			2
a bizarre match followed a surreal start to the evening – not only were @entity3 not allowed to walk out to the iconic ‘ @entity125 ’ song under @entity44 regulations but some fans will have been devastated to learn that beer was also banned in the ground ! on target : @entity32 ' 15th - minute strike deflected in off @entity9 defender @entity131 leading the way : the @entity134 international wheels away in celebration after helping @entity3 take the lead fans can watch @entity3 in the @entity1 live on @entity138 back on the pitch , with this year ’s @entity1 winners gaining automatic entry into next season ’s @entity141 , @entity3 will be eager to build on their enthralling start to the campaign			1
both sides showed @entity44 ’s secondary competition the full respect it deserves by playing their strongest teams which , of course , made for a better match in terms of tactics and play ; a real match - up of the @entity67 and @entity156 ’s fifth - best clubs			2
while the football was entertaining from start to finish , one of the biggest cheers of the night came as @entity162 was introduced from the bench following an eleven - month spell on the sidelines through injury			0
delighted to see the midfielder return , the @entity52 faithful gave the 26 - year - old a rousing reception in another extremely positive moment of the 90 minutes			0
in action : former @entity65 man @entity172 battles for the ball under the lights at @entity52 @entity162 later said on social media : ‘ been a long hard 11 months for me , absolutely delighted to get back on that pitch tonight ! great win by the lads			0
’ it seems it was smiles on faces for everyone connected with the club as two of @entity3 ’s summer arrivals , youngsters @entity184 and @entity187 , were seen laughing and joking outside the ground ahead of kick - off – settling in well on @entity48			2
pundit @entity190 – a member of the @entity3 team who defeated @entity193 in 1985 during one of @entity52 ’s greatest nights - was delighted too , happy to see the club perform so well on their return and could not hide his pleasure on the @entity138 sofa			1
with the @entity3 camp on cloud nine , @entity9 ’s night did n’t go to plan at all			1
welcome back : @entity52 looked a picture under the floodlights after defender @entity77 was unlucky to see the ball ricochet off him and into his own net , the game was halted as goalkeeper @entity206 left the field of the play – much to the bemusement of fans around the ground			0
some rumours quickly circulated the @entity214 goalkeeper requested to quickly go off to replace a contact lens while other whispers , perhaps mischievously , claimed @entity206 had to leave the field in order to take a toilet break			0
ahead of kick - off @entity9 ’s vocal support had made themselves known , loud and brash , unfurling huge flags in the @entity224			2
however , with the game as good as over just minutes into the second half that exuberance quelled as trouble brewed among the away fans ; add to that sightings of a streaker and it was all going on in one small corner of the ground			0
the teams of @entity237 media personnel packed into the front of the @entity52 press box will have probably written more about what went on off the pitch rather than the action on it			0
as for @entity3 , following yet another classy win under @entity0 , the feel - good factor continues to grow and looks set to sweep through @entity44			1
follow all the latest # @entity1 action at @entity44			0
