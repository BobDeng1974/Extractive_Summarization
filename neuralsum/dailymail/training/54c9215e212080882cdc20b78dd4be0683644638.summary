by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:27 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 04:09 est , 25 january 2013 @entity2 hope new tv camera angles will help @entity4 escape with a three - match ban after his fracas with @entity8 ball boy @entity7			1
as the @entity10 ’s disciplinary chiefs examined the evidence - with a decision expected on friday on whether hazard will receive an extended ban - the focus sharpened on @entity7 ’s role in the ugly episode			1
@entity18 had been reluctant to become involved , but their hand was forced after three members of the public made complaints about the @entity2 winger ’s tussle with @entity7 at the @entity25			1
flashpoint : @entity2 's @entity4 clashed with the teenage ball boy who is lying on the ball grabbed : hazard reaches for the football as the ball boy writhes on the ground video : see @entity4 's apology to @entity35 immediately after the match the 17 - year - old student is the son of @entity38 - a @entity8 director , the club ’s biggest shareholder and , with a £ 42million fortune , one of the financial forces behind their rise to the @entity45			1
not surprisingly , the @entity47 club have decided to take no action against @entity49 , who retreated to the family ’s £ 1.5m mansion in @entity52 yesterday			2
as he did , many people inside football took @entity4 ’s side and criticised the teenager , who had boasted on @entity58 before the @entity61 semi-final second leg how he was an expert at wasting time			2
‘ the king of all ball boys is back making his final appearance # needed # for # timewasting ’ he posted			1
his @entity58 page also contains photographs of a millionaire lifestyle which includes first - class air travel , broken champagne bottles , designer labels and staggering bar bills			0
it all supports the notion he may be the richest ball boy in the @entity45 , the heir to a family fortune built on a travel business and boutique hotels who is even wealthier than many of the players			2
@entity7 has worked as a @entity8 ball boy since he was 12 and said he had been called up by his father for wednesday ’s game because some of the regulars could not make it to the game because of the snow			1
the ball came his way with 10 minutes to go and with @entity8 still holding their 2 - 0 advantage from the first leg			1
he refused to hand it back to @entity4 , rolling on to the ball and smothering it with his body until @entity4 kicked it clear			1
anger : @entity8 's @entity100 ( centre ) is held back as he tries to confront @entity4 ( off camera ) sending off : @entity2 's @entity4 ( # 17 ) receives a red card from referee @entity104 for violent conduct @entity2 claim another ball boy had appeared to be wasting time 10 minutes earlier			1
hazard was again close to the action and remonstrated with the referee			0
the @entity10 ’s disciplinary team spent yesterday studying replays of the incident from different camera angles , including one which appears to show @entity4 made fairly clean contact with the ball			1
footage shown at the time , together with the dramatic reaction of the teenager , suggested @entity4 had administered a hefty boot to @entity7 ’s ribs on the way to the ball			1
helping hand : @entity2 's @entity124 ( right ) checks on the ball boy after he had clashed with @entity4 @entity126 : the 17 - year - old earlier wrote on @entity58 that he was ' needed for timewasting ' former @entity2 and @entity130 winger @entity129 branded @entity7 ’s actions ‘ disgraceful and unacceptably brattish ’ , and claimed the ball boy was ‘ acting ’ when he claimed to be hurt			1
‘ he ’s only got one job and that ’s to give the ball back , ’ @entity129 told @entity133			2
‘ and what does he do ? he keeps the ball			0
’ @entity139 manager @entity138 said he would have done the same as @entity4			0
‘ i can see why he did it , ’ said the @entity141			0
‘ the boy should n’t lie on the ball and play rugby with it			0
’ wealthy : @entity7 ( left ) , the ball boy who was kicked by @entity4 during a @entity61 game last night , is the son of multi-millionaire businessman @entity38 ( right ) property : the self - made tycoon is the owner of the luxury @entity152 in @entity8 , pictured boasting : @entity7 posted a picture of a broken bottle of @entity157 champagne on his @entity58 page , as well as one of torn - up betting slips many professional footballers tweeted in support of the @entity2 player , with @entity164 assailing @entity7 ’s reaction as ‘ scandalous ’			1
rather than basking in the glory of reaching their first major final after beating the @entity170 champions , @entity8 were on the defensive yesterday			0
vice-chairman @entity172 said : ‘ we do n’t line up the ball boys and ask them to waste time			2
' the boy went to pick up the ball and he fell over			0
he did n’t hold on to the ball for a minute			0
it happened over about 20 seconds			0
travelling in style : @entity7 put up this picture of himself in @entity182 's upper class destination : the teenager on holiday in @entity186 , in another picture he posted to @entity58 ' had it been 2 - 0 to @entity2 , i do n’t think @entity4 would have been anywhere near the ball			1
but i do n’t think @entity4 deliberately went to kick him			0
’ @entity8 first - team coach @entity192 added : ‘ we never gave them instructions to slow the game down			2
it ’s never been the case			0
’ @entity4 was sent off by referee @entity104 for violent conduct , which will carry an automatic three - match ban , ruling the winger out of games against @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			2
pricey : a photo of the @entity207 store in @entity186 which @entity7 put on @entity58 shared : the teenager retweeted someone else 's £ 120,000 receipt with the caption , ' this is huge time ' , and also let his friends know about the good weather at his holiday destination @entity2 do not intend to appeal but the @entity10 can opt to pass the case on to an independent commission if they suspect three matches is insufficient punishment			1
they were also gathering evidence from the match officials and @entity18 , and spoke to officials at @entity8 to ascertain the ball boy ’s version of events			2
@entity2 hope the video , together with @entity4 ’s public apology immediately after the game and his previous record of good behaviour , can bring the case down on their side			1
in pain : @entity7 ( second right ) is ushered away from the sidelines following the incident with hazard @entity7 was invited into the visitors ’ dressing room after the game and spoke to @entity4			1
they apologised to each other , according to @entity2 ’s interim manager @entity241			0
the ball boy and @entity8 agreed they would not lodge a police complaint but the local force had three complaints from the public which they are obliged to follow			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , will discipline hazard according to their internal procedure and within the @entity250 limit of two weeks ’ wages , which would be a maximum of £ 340,000			1
striker : @entity4 is pictured earlier in the match ( left ) and winning an award in @entity256 in may 2011 ( right ) it was headline news in his native @entity259			0
he became the most expensive @entity259 footballer ever when he moved from @entity261 to @entity2 for £ 32m last year and was in touch with friends at home yesterday to insist he had done nothing wrong			2
it is not his first brush with controversy			0
he was widely criticised when he was substituted after 60 minutes in a @entity270 qualifier against @entity271			0
@entity4 stormed straight down the tunnel and was later filmed eating a hamburger nearby when the game was still going on			0
hurt : the ballboy ( centre ) is ushered away from the sidelines following the incident with @entity4 should @entity4 face long ban for ball boy kick ? this did nothing for his popularity but he does not have a reputation for a violent temper			1
those who followed his career in @entity289 insisted the ball - boy incident was totally out of character yet there was a warning from the @entity10			1
their chief executive @entity294 said : ‘ it is unfortunate and not something we are proud of			2
no football authority or person interested in football likes to see acts of violence or lack of respect			0
it might have happened in the heat of the fire but professionals are expected to be able to control themselves			0
‘ i ’m convinced @entity309 will realise that			0
he is more than intelligent enough to understand that this is going to be a lesson learned for him			0

@entity2 think video will clear @entity4
