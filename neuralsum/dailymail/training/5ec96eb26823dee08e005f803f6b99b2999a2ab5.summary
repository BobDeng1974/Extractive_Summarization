by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 16:37 est , 3 may 2013 jailed : @entity1 has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 18 years for the murder of 23 month - old @entity5 a man who battered his girlfriend ’s daughter to death after she left her in his care while she went on holiday to @entity12 - has been jailed for life			1
@entity1 , 21 , left 23 month - old @entity5 with devastating brain injuries just hours after her mother @entity15 flew to the @entity16 to celebrate her 21st birthday			1
an investigation revealed she was either pushed or fell down the stairs and tests showed she was punched , slapped and subjected to ‘ vigorous shaking ’ before she died			1
@entity1 from @entity23 , @entity22 was convicted of murder today and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years			2
ms @entity5 was just hours in to her five - day break when she got a call to say @entity5 had been injured at home			1
she caught the first available flight back home and found her daughter was on a life support machine			0
the toddler died hours later			0
passing sentence the judge mr justice @entity34 said : ' it was an appalling crime which involved a grown and powerful man inflicting a number of hard blows on a toddler which were sufficiently forceful to cause devastating brain damage from which she died			2
' @entity5 was particularly vulnerable because of her age and that at the time of the offence the defendant was entrusted with the sole care of her			1
' while i accept that @entity5 may not have been easy to look after that day as she was not well and the @entity49 had limited parenting experience , i do not consider that to be of great significance when he only had to look after her for one day and it was at his insistence that he had the care of her			1
' @entity22 @entity57 was told the tragedy occurred in march last year after ms @entity5 was bought tickets to fly out to the @entity16 for a sightseeing trip			1
originally @entity5 ’s grandmother was due to look after the toddler			2
tragic : @entity63 ( right ) with her mother @entity15			1
the 23 month - old died from a brain injury inflicted by @entity1 after her mother had flown to @entity12 to celebrate her 21st birthday care : @entity1 had been left to care for @entity5 at the home the couple shared in this street in @entity71 , @entity22 but @entity1 , who was not the youngster ’s biological father , persuaded ms @entity5 to leave the child with him at their shared home in @entity71 because he wanted to ‘ bond ’ with her			1
now 22 , @entity15 told the jury : ' i trusted him and did n’t think he would cause any harm to her			2
i thought they would have bonded , they would have got on , not that anything like this would have happened			0
' but in the early hours of march 10 , @entity1 rang 999 and told the operator : ' my baby ’s fell down the stairs			2
i ca n’t really hear breathing			0
' defenceless : @entity1 had said he wanted to ' bond ' with @entity5 later while @entity5 was being treated at @entity91 , @entity92 , the partner of her great aunt noticed @entity1 was particularly upset			1
mr @entity92 said : ' i tried to comfort him by saying it was just a tragic accident			0
but he said ‘ i killed her ’			0
he was very emotional at the time			0
' he was crying , he seemed really upset			0
he was concerned that the police were going to get him and he would get arrested and he would go to prison			0
at the time we did n’t think too much about it			0
we put it down to grief and emotion			0
' inquiries revealed in the hours before @entity5 was taken to hospital that @entity105 posted a photo of @entity5 on @entity107 , with a caption saying she had hit her head on a door at @entity111			2
but the day after she died , he edited the caption on the picture to read , ‘ aah my little princess when she banged her head on the floor ’			0
@entity1 denied murder and insisted the child ’s injuries were caused by an accidental fall down the stairs at the house he shared with @entity5 and her mother in @entity71			1
he said : ' @entity5 called me daddy the first day i met her - i had a bond with @entity125 , we were so close - i thought @entity15 was the one			1
' but @entity127 from @entity128 said : ' @entity5 was a two - year - old little girl who should have felt safe in her own home in the care of @entity131			1
he abused his position of trust and subjected an innocent toddler to an attack which left her with an unsurvivable head injury			0
' we will never know exactly what happened on that day , as @entity105 has always maintained that it was an accident			0
@entity5 ’s family are devastated by @entity1 ’s actions and will never be able to see [ her ] grow up into a young woman , see her get married and have children of her own			1
' he has now been jailed , and will have to live the rest of his life with the knowledge that he is responsible for killing @entity5			2
