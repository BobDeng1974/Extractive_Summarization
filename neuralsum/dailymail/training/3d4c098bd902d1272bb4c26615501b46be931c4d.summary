it is one of the wonders of nature - thousands of starlings acting together as a single living creature , and yet no - one really knows why			2
the extraordinary displays - called murmurations - often produce a variety of recognisable shapes with tens of thousands of birds gathering together to fly in unison			1
the reason for the beautiful spectacle is not definitively known , with theories ranging from a defence mechanism against predators to a way of attracting more birds to join their winter roost			1
a survey of the birds across the @entity40 is currently taking place , with members of the public being encouraged to record any sightings they make			0
the poll , conducted by the @entity47 and the @entity48 , is the first of its kind and has already received more than 600 reports from @entity52 to @entity53			0
dr @entity54 , reader in applied ecology at @entity47 , said : ' one of the theories behind the murmurations is that it means they are safer from predators such as hawks and falcons			0
vast numbers : up to 50,000 starlings in formation were caught on camera above the town of @entity28 , in @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity70 wonder : the birds have been known to form a variety of recognisable shapes during their spectacular murmurations ' another theory could be they are signalling a large roost and could be a way of attracting other birds to that area to build up a big flock as it would be warmer			1
' it 's much warmer to roost as a big group rather than a smaller one and the murmurations can be as big as 100,000 birds			2
' why is it only @entity90 starlings that undertake massive aerial displays for sustained period before roosting ? we do n't really know			1
annual phenomenon : @entity95 is famous for these ‘ murmurations ’ - where starlings fly back en masse to their winter roost in the @entity70 village after a day ’s feeding theory : ecologist dr @entity54 believes the murmurations make starlings safer from predators such as hawks and falcons ' but that makes this topic a really fascinating one to study			1
if we can work out exactly why starlings murmurate , maybe it will be a good way in to working out why many other species do not			0
' the study is asking people who see murmurations to records things such as the location , the number of birds , the habitat and how long it lasts			0
starling numbers in the @entity40 are actually declining - falling by 66 per cent since the 1970s - and it is hoped the survey will provide important information about their habitat and behaviour			2
the survey can be found at www.societyofbiology.org/starlingsurvey			0
alternative explanation : another theory is that the starlings are signalling a large roost and trying to attract other birds to the area fascinating : it is only @entity90 starlings that undertake massive aerial displays for sustained periods before roosting a survey of the birds across the @entity40 is currently taking place and the public is being encouraged to record any sightings they make fall in population : starling numbers in the @entity40 are actually declining - falling by 66 per cent since the 1970s tens of thousands of starlings start their murmuration , with @entity150 mountain in the background , as dusk falls near @entity95 on the @entity154 and @entity70 border			1

every year , starlings gather in vast numbers in the @entity70 town of @entity28 , near to the border with @entity154
this week up to 50,000 were filmed during their spectacular aerial displays - which are known as murmurations
some claim behaviour is defence against predators while others say it is to attract more birds to their winter roost
