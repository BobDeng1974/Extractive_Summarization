by @entity0 it was perhaps his most famous act of open rebellion – unfurling the @entity5 flag above @entity7 ’s head at @entity8 as @entity9 lifted the men ’s singles trophy last year			1
but the person behind the plot was actually @entity13 ’s wife , @entity11 , who smuggled the enormous @entity14 into the @entity15 in her handbag			1
it was a typical gesture from a woman who has been conspicuous in her absence over the past few weeks as her husband works the @entity22 campaign trail			2
at 77 , she is 17 years his senior , and those who know the couple say he relies on her shrewdness and wise counsel			2
they also credit her with having the final say on his return to the leadership of the @entity42 in 2004			2
intriguingly , while the couple ’s views are mostly aligned , he has said : ‘ she ’s much more radical than i am now in all sorts of things			0
’ mrs @entity13 has been so successful at avoiding publicity the vast majority of @entity5 have no idea what she even looks like			1
‘ i ’m no @entity52			0
i married @entity13 , not politics , ’ she said			1
‘ i am happy to be in the background			0
one politician in the family is quite enough			0
’ private : the @entity42 leader and his wife at his election in 1987			0
' i am happy to be in the background , ' she said last night , a senior politician and close friend said : ‘ @entity11 sees herself simply as @entity13 ’s wife , not the @entity66 of @entity5			1
she ’s very charming , very kind and has a wonderful way with everyone			0
’ the couple met in @entity70 in the 1970s			0
she was then 24 - year - old mr @entity13 ’s boss in the @entity71 for @entity5 , where he was an assistant economist			1
they married within three years , in 1981			2
when mr @entity13 was elected to @entity74 in 1987 , his wife , then 50 , gave up her job and supported his career			1
as the referendum approaches , she has set up camp at their official residence , @entity81 , and will quietly support her husband whichever way the vote falls .			0
