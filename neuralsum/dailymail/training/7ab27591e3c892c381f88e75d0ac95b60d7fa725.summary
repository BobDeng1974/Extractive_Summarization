by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 27 november 2012 a pensioner is pleading with the @entity2 to turn her from a woman back into a man , after realising the sex change operation she had 23 years ago was a huge mistake			1
@entity10 veteran @entity9 , 75 , underwent a full male to female gender reassignment - but says it left her trapped in the wrong body			1
she 's now ditched her wardrobe of women 's clothes to live as a man again and is on the waiting list for a mastectomy			2
the pensioner , who is legally and still physically a woman , says she is desperate to return to her birth sex before it is too late			1
@entity9 has extended a desperate apology to her family , who disowned her after they discovered her secret life @entity9 , who changed her name to @entity31 after her wife and four children disowned her , says she knew the sex change was a mistake when she grew sick of doing her hair and make up and continued to be attracted to straight women			1
she says : ' i 'm a red - blooded man and always have been			2
i still ca n't believe this happened to me			2
i should never have been given the op. i tried to make a success of it , what else could i do ? ' but i 've been living a lie			2
the sex change was a huge mistake			1
' i was vulnerable and i was given poor advice which has ruined my life			2
i do n't want this to happen to anyone else			2
' @entity9 , of @entity52 , is pleading with doctors to turn her back into a man , claiming she should never have been operated on			1
but her local @entity56 have so far refused to fund a reversal			2
@entity9 wants to warn others considering the operation and apologise to her family for the decision to change genders @entity9 said she tried to embrace her new life by wearing clothes and make - up - but realised she had never wanted to be a woman now she wants to warn others considering the operation and extend a desperate apology to her family who have disowned her			1
@entity9 says : ' having a sex change was the biggest mistake of my life			1
it has left me isolated from my children and feeling like a social misfit			2
i would do anything to see them again			2
' i 'm lonely because i want a relationship with a woman but i ca n't have a physical relationship because i 've got no equipment			2
' i want to advise others to think twice , it 's one heck of a mistake to make and as i have found out there is no going back			1
' @entity9 's horror story began when she sought help for depression from her gp after being made redundant			1
during the meeting she admitted to dressing in her wife 's clothes for a secret thrill			2
she says she now realizes this was as far as she ever wanted to go			2
but she claims her gp concluded she could have been depressed because she wanted to be a woman and advised her to start taking hormone pills			1
after 23 miserable years spent as a woman @entity9 said she donated all of her dresses to a charity shop and stopped taking hormone pills @entity9 says : ' i was desperate to be happy so i did as he said and started taking the pills			1
before i knew it my beard had stopped growing and i grew breasts			2
' i was fascinated and hoped feeling like a woman would make me feel better			2
' but @entity9 did n't tell her wife of 25 years and their four children			1
' i dressed as a woman in secret but in public nobody guessed			0
i knew they would be horrified and was too afraid to tell them			0
' ' my daughter got married months after i started taking the pills and i gave her away terrified that somebody would notice the father of the bride had grown breasts			0
' of course i bound them tightly under my shirt and prayed nobody would spot them			0
' six months on @entity9 's marriage ended in 1986 without her wife guessing the secret			1
it was only after she moved out that she found a box of women 's clothes in the loft belonging to @entity9			1
@entity9 wants to have his procedure reversed , saying that he has been a ' red - blooded man ' all along and the procedure left him feeling confused and upset she says : ' i got a call from my son telling me they were all disgusted and wanted nothing more to do with me			1
' i tried to call and wrote to explain but they never spoke to me again			0
' meanwhile her gp had referred her to a psychiatrist who diagnosed @entity9 as suffering from gender identity disorder and suggested she consider a sex change			1
' i went along with it because i trusted them and thought they must be right even if i had never considered myself trapped in the wrong body before			0
looking back i think all the female hormones had fuddled my mind			1
' now working as an architect she kept his secret by dressing as a man during the day right up until the surgery			0
but on the morning of the operation in @entity166 in april 1989 @entity9 started to panic			1
' i put it down to nerves , but even in the operating theatre a voice in my head said it was a mistake , but i felt it was too late to back out			1
i had gone too far			0
the next thing i knew i woke up a woman			1
' she said the operation had essentially left her a lesbian and she has struggled with relationships ever since but to her horror when she looked in the mirror , she did n't feel happy or content , just upset and more confused			1
' i did my best to embrace it ; i bought bikinis and nice dresses			0
i spent time on my hair and make up and always had lovely manicured nails			0
' i wrote to my children to tell them , i hoped they would accept me but they did n't			0
' ' i was so lonely , especially because i thought when i was a female i might be attracted to men , but i still only fancied women and always have done			0
' the operation had essentially left me a lesbian , something i had never considered and was n't happy about			1
' within the first year @entity9 had grown sick of doing her hair and make up and even hated dressing in women 's clothes full time			1
' it was all so fussy and time consuming			0
it was then it hit me , i had n't wanted to be a woman - i just liked dressing up as one from time to time for a thrill and it should never have gone any further			0
i was a man trapped in a woman 's body and i was stuck with it			0
it was too late to do anything about it			1
i could n't believe i had gone so far			0
the pensioner is warning others about the procedure after his experience in 1990 one year after the operation she wrote to her psychiatrist for help saying the operation had been a mistake and asked if she could have it reversed			1
' he replied to say i needed to get on with it and embrace life as woman and make a success of it			0
' what choice did i have ? ' in the years that followed she took up modelling and dance classes , but no matter what she did @entity9 never felt like a woman			1
' i passed well as a woman and those who knew said they all thought i had been born that way			0
' but i always felt it was an act			1
i was pretending waiting for it to feel ' right ' but it never did			0
eventually after 23 miserable years she had had enough of living a lie and took all of her women 's clothes to the charity shop			0
last year she stopped taking pills to let her facial hair grow back and started dressing as @entity9 again			1
' my breasts remained so i covered them up with baggy tops			0
i looked like a man again and felt like a man again			2
' i knew i wanted to the man i had been born in every sense and went to my gp to enquire about a reversal			0
i told him the operation had been a mistake			1
in my mind i was misdiagnosed and should not have been operated on			0
' he prescribed testosterone and recommended me for a mastectomy			0
but he was n't sure what could be done about my sexual organs			0
' he wrote to the @entity56 but they said no funding would be available for a reversal			0
' it 's left me trapped			0
i date women but once they find out i have a female body it always ends			0
' all i can hope is that my children read this and understand what i have been through			0
i 'm so sorry that i ever went ahead with it			0
having a sex change was the biggest mistake of my life and it 's cost me dearly			1
' having to spend the rest of my days in the wrong body is bad enough , but it 's nothing compared to the pain i feel for not knowing my children			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
