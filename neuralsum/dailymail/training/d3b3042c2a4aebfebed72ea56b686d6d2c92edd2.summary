thousands of revellers partied the night away oblivious to the fact that there were guardian angels watching over them to ensure their new year celebrations ran smoothly			1
about 60 dedicated volunteers patrolled @entity8 streets offering water , lollipops and even pairs of thongs for those with tired feet from dancing the night away in high heels			1
what seems like a simple gesture is all part of a much bigger plan so that no parent has to endure the eternal heartache that @entity21 and @entity22 have for the past two and half years after tragically losing their son to a senseless act			0
his parents started a foundation in his honour , and in conjunction with the @entity49 , volunteers hit the streets every friday and saturday night wearing @entity34 ' initials which stand for take kare - the last words @entity21 and @entity22 ever said to their son			1
a dedicated safe space is also provided for those who may have overindulged and are in need of a much - needed rest			1
@entity49 lead organiser @entity56 said party - goers can charge their phones , drink water , use the angel 's phones to contact family or friends to pick them up			1
' they are feeling smashed , got sore feet and probably feeling a bit groggy in the head , so if we can help them feel a bit more comfortable or help get them home in the right direction i think it 's the small stuff but hopefully that 's intervening before things go to a really bad place , ' he told @entity77			0
' this is a brilliant project and i applaud @entity21 for his determination in seeing it set up , ' mr @entity56 said			0
' i think that @entity34 would be blown away by the support this program is receiving and the volunteers who turn up to help serve and wear @entity34 's name on their chest which is an honour for us - and i really hope we are doing him proud			1
' the safe space , which is also rolling out in @entity90 and @entity92 aswell , is funded by the @entity93 and @entity94 but there is only enough funding for a three - month trial			2
' if it saves one persons ' life it 's definitely a service worth doing , ' @entity21 said			2
' most parents probably will have no idea that their parents were saves last night or the night before - it 's really about making sure our kids get home safely			0
' we are looking for an organisation to partner with us to fund this program to help our youth in the city and other areas around @entity8			1
' @entity8 's designated safe space needs more funding to keep going after the three month trial @entity34 ( pictured left in surveillance footage ) with his friends on his first and last night out in @entity36 there has been no serious brain injury as a result of alcohol at @entity124 's hospital in 2014 since the part of the new licensing restrictions which were introduced in february his wife , @entity22 , said her job is done if no other families have to suffer the way hers has from a single cowardly punch			1
' life will never be the same - we miss @entity34 deeply and it never really gets better i think people think you could you get over it but you never do , ' she said			2
@entity138 , 18 , who is only just of legal age and does n't drink much , volunteered to help patrol the streets on wednesday night			0
' it is a big task but i find because i 'm so young i 'm able to relate to people who are my age and kind of be like that mother hen , ' she said			0
the foundation successfully lobbied the @entity146 government to increase licensing restrictions across the heart of @entity8 now they are turning to the federal government to curb alcohol advertising			2
' we have seen no serious brain injury as a result of alcohol at @entity124 's hospital for 2014 and that has to be a good thing and that 's a part of the new laws that were introduced in february this year , ' @entity21 told @entity77			0
' life will never be the same - we miss @entity34 deeply and it never really gets better i think people think you could you get over it but you never do , ' says his mother @entity22 @entity49 lead organiser @entity56 said party - goers can charge their phones , drink water , use the angel 's phones to contact family or friends to pick them up from the safe space but this does n't mean that alcohol - fuelled violence is not still prevalent among young people			1
' it 's very sad we see it keep happening over and over again and i think that often makes you feel like throwing your arms up in the air and saying " we 've tried what more can we do ? " but we have to keep trying , ' @entity22 insists			0
the foundation is also working on changing the justice system to put the victim 's rights ahead of the offenders			0
@entity34 ' killer was initially sentenced to just five years jail for manslaughter which was doubled to ten years following an appeal			2
' there 's this terrible injustice going on in this state as we have seen on multiple occasions and that really has to stop , ' @entity21 said			0
' we can not let these offenders roam our streets and be let off time and time again			0
' if you are interested in helping to fund the program contact the @entity200 @entity138 , 18 , ( right ) who is only just of legal age and does n't drink much , volunteered to help patrol the streets in @entity8 on wednesday night			1
