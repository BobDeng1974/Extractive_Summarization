by @entity0 published : 00:43 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 11 september 2013 @entity2 guitarist @entity1 has been criticised by @entity4 leaders after describing the cull of around 5,000 badgers in south west @entity7 as ' genocide in the countryside '			1
mr may made the comments during a visit to @entity13 to show his opposition to the cull in the county and @entity17 to protect cattle from bovine tb			1
he likened the measure to genocide - a word usually used to describe the mass murder of people			1
' offensive ' : @entity2 guitarist @entity1 , pictured at a protest against the cull last year , has offended the @entity4 community by comparing the cull of 5,000 badgers to genocide anger : the cull of badgers in @entity17 and @entity13 has sparked fierce protest but he faced an immediate backlash after his comments were reported online , with local @entity4 describing his comparison as ' dreadful ' and ' inflammatory '			1
rabbi @entity38 of the @entity39 said apart from being potentially offensive , using the term was incorrect			2
she said : ' the use of the word ' genocide ' in this context is simply wrong			2
from an etymological point of view genocide means " killing of people "			2
' in particular i think high profile people need to be careful when they take a word like that out of context , especially when using it to emote others			2
' from a @entity4 perspective obviously it makes people think of the @entity57 , in which not only were many people killed but they were dehumanised to make that killing seem acceptable			1
' it has the potential to cause offence but i think that most people would just see it as a ridiculous thing to say			0
' protection : the cull of badgers is the only way to stop the spread of bovine tb to cows , claim farmers @entity75 , chairwoman of the @entity76 , said that mr may 's choice of words was ill - advised			1
' @entity1 obviously feels very passionately about the badger cull and we must not fault that , ' she said			1
' but the @entity57 was a terrible thing			0
i can understand if some of our members are upset by his ill - advised use of the term genocide			0
' let 's put it into perspective though			0
he misused a word - i 'm sure he did n't mean to say something atrocious			0
' the badger cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tuberculosis , which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of more than 305,000 cattle in the @entity100 over the past decade			0
connection : rabbi @entity38 of the @entity39 said that the word genocide made @entity4 people think of the @entity57 the past 15 years has seen a boom in the disease , which is transmitted by badgers urinating on grass which is then eaten by cows			1
farmers say a cull is the only way to protect their livestock , and the government has approved a trial in west @entity17 and west @entity13 that could see as many as 5,000 badgers killed			1
the current scheme , which will last for six weeks , is due to be repeated every year for the next four years , and is predicted to cut bovine tb by some 16 per cent			0
two companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling			0
@entity121 and @entity7 have kept their identities confidential , in case activists target them directly			0
animal rights groups , which have received support from mr may and @entity127 , say the authorities should vaccinate badgers instead .			0

@entity1 made the comments during a protest visit to @entity13
