children under 12 should be banned from playing football , researchers have claimed			1
they say the risk of brain damage from youth football is simply too great			1
it found that former @entity8 players who participated in tackle football before the age of 12 are more likely to have memory and thinking problems as adults			1
the study contradicts conventional wisdom that children 's more plastic brains might recover from injury better than those of adults scientists examined test scores of 42 former @entity8 players , with an average age of 52 , all of whom had experienced memory and thinking problems for at least six months			1
half the players had played tackle football before age 12 , and half had not			1
significantly , the total number of concussions was similar between the two groups			0
researchers found that the players exposed to tackle football before age 12 had greater impairment in mental flexibility , memory , and intelligence — a 20 percent difference in some cases			1
both groups scored below average on many of the tests			0
but a new study from @entity49 researchers points to a possible increased risk of cognitive impairment from playing youth football			1
' sports offer huge benefits to kids , as far as work ethic , leadership , and fitness , and we think kids should participate , ' says study lead author @entity61			0
' but there 's increasing evidence that children respond differently to head trauma than adults			0
' kids who are hitting their heads over and over during this important time of brain development may have consequences later in life			0
' the @entity73 – funded study , published online in the january 28 , 2015 , edition of the journal @entity77 , finds that former @entity8 players who participated in tackle football before the age of 12 are more likely to have memory and thinking problems as adults			1
' for many , the love affair begins in childhood : @entity87 start as young as age five , and many adults retain warm memories and friendships from their youth football days , ' the researcher wrote			1
the study contradicts conventional wisdom that children 's more plastic brains might recover from injury better than those of adults , and suggests that they may actually be more vulnerable to repeated head impacts , especially if injuries occur during a critical period of growth and development			1
' this is one study , with limitations , ' adds study senior author @entity108 , a @entity109 professor of neurology , neurosurgery , and anatomy and neurobiology and director of the @entity116 's @entity115			0
' but the findings support the idea that it may not make sense to allow children — at a time when their brain is rapidly developing — to be exposed to repetitive hits to the head			0
' if larger studies confirm this one , we may need to consider safety changes in youth sports			1
' for this latest study , scientists examined test scores of 42 former @entity8 players , with an average age of 52 , all of whom had experienced memory and thinking problems for at least six months			0
half the players had played tackle football before age 12 , and half had not			2
significantly , the total number of concussions was similar between the two groups			0
researchers found that the players exposed to tackle football before age 12 had greater impairment in mental flexibility , memory , and intelligence — a 20 percent difference in some cases			1
these findings held up even after statistically removing the effects of the total number of years the participants played football			2
both groups scored below average on many of the tests			0

' we were surprised by how striking the results were , ' says @entity170			0
' every single test was significantly different , by a lot			0
' @entity170 says that the researchers were especially surprised by the scores on a reading test called the @entity176 - 4 , which has participants read words of increasing difficulty			2
a person 's score depends on the ability to pronounce the words correctly , indicating the person 's familiarity with complex vocabulary			0
the low scores may be significant , she says , because they suggest that repeated head trauma at a young age might limit peak intelligence			2
she emphasizes , however , that there may be other reasons for a low score , and that more research is needed			0
' if you take just the hippocampus , that 's a really important part of your brain , ' he says			0
' it may be that if you hit your head a lot during this important period , you might have significant memory problems later on			0
' @entity108 adds that a study by another group of researchers of the number and severity of hits in football players aged 9 to 12 , using accelerometers in helmets , found that players received an average of 240 high - magnitude hits per season , sometimes with a force similar to that experienced by high school and college players			1
researchers say say the risk of brain damage from youth football is simply too great			1
with approximately 4.8 million athletes playing youth football in the @entity233 , the long - term consequences of brain injury represent a growing public health concern			1
' football has the highest injury rate among team sports , ' writes @entity238 , a fellow with the @entity239 , in an editorial accompanying the @entity77 article			2
' given that 70 percent of all football players in the @entity233 are under the age of 14 , and every child aged 9 to 12 can be exposed to 240 head impacts during a single football season , a better understanding of how these impacts may affect children 's brains is urgently needed			1
' @entity238 's editorial cautions that the study has limitations : because the researchers could not precisely determine the players ' lifetime number of head impacts , it may be the total number of hits — rather than the age of a player — that is the more critical measurement			2
' sports are important , and we want kids to participate in football , ' says @entity170			2
' but no eight - year - old should play a sport with his friends and end up with long - term problems			2
' we just want kids to play sports more safely			2

researchers had believed young brains were more plastic and *resilient*
now say the *opposite* is true and there are more vulnerable
