@entity0 was the second most highly - anticipated birth of the year			0
but @entity1 will have to wait for its first baby panda after it emerged that @entity3 has lost her much longed - for cub			1
after weeks of high hopes for an historic captivity - bred newborn , @entity6 yesterday announced that the animal – also known as @entity11 – had lost the baby late in the pregnancy			2
@entity3 , @entity1 's only female giant panda , is believed to have lost her cub experts noted signs in august that the artifical insemination in april had been successful and a panda cub had been expected for last month professor @entity19 , chief executive of the @entity20 , said : ‘ everyone is saddened by this turn of events after so many weeks of waiting			1
’ despite the disappointment , the zoo has vowed to try again with a breeding programme and said it is ‘ confident ’ of success			2
professor @entity19 added : ‘ the majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until their third or fourth year and what we have achieved considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years is immense			2
‘ new hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought , though at the moment no one knows why			2
’ the panda 's carers at @entity6 had been kept guessing whether @entity3 was pregnant after she was artificially inseminated in april @entity3 was artificially inseminated using semen from @entity47 ( pictured ) and another panda @entity1 ’s only female giant panda arrived from @entity50 in 2011 in a £ 6million loan along with a male , @entity47			1
from the off , it was hoped the pair would be the first giant pandas to breed in @entity1 during their ten - year stay			0
pandas find it difficult to conceive because females become fertile just once a year for 36 hours between mid-april and may			0
attempts at getting a pair to mate , meanwhile , can often prove fruitless			0
even where they are successful , fertilized eggs remain suspended within the panda until an unknown trigger causes it to implant			2
it is then difficult to determine whether they are pregnant because they do not develop a ' baby bump '			2
the bears also commonly have phantom pregnancies - @entity3 had one last year			1
@entity3 then kept everyone guessing over a possible pregnancy when she was artificially inseminated in april			1
a public already gripped by the @entity78 ’s pregnancy was given regular updates on the ten - year - old			0
in august , the zoo delivered the news that @entity3 could just be a fortnight away from giving birth – and twins were a possibility			1
hormone and protein tests and the production of breast milk ‘ seemed to suggest ’ she was expecting and the zoo went into panda cub overdrive – putting two incubators on standby , beaming @entity89 footage of the panda enclosure into staff homes and flying in a panda birth expert from @entity50			0
but over the last few days she has returned to non-pregnancy eating and behavioural patterns , leading experts to believe she had lost the baby			1
officials are not sure exactly what went wrong but believe she ‘ re-absorbed ’ the tiny foetus , which would have been smaller than half a block of butter , back into her body			0
@entity106 , director of the zoo ’s panda project , said : ‘ why does this happen ? we do n’t truly understand , but what we do know is this is a species which lives on the edge of a balance between nutritional uptake and reproducing			0
‘ if things are n’t quite right this can be a reason why they absorb the young and cancel the pregnancy			0
we are determined to learn from this			0
