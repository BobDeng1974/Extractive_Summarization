a cure for @entity2 could be further away than scientists had hoped , new research suggests a cure for @entity2 could be further away than scientists had hoped , new research suggests			1
researchers discovered that dormant @entity2 lingers in the body even after seemingly successful treatment			1
this dormant @entity2 is now known to pose a far bigger threat than was previously thought because the amount of hidden virus that remains after treatment may be 60 times greater than earlier estimates , according to the new findings			1
the sleeping viruses , called proviruses , are a danger because they can become reactivated despite treatment with the best @entity2 drugs – if this happens , the disease will return			1
experts say the discovery , which was reported in the journal @entity24 , is a setback in the fight against @entity27 and highlights the fact that @entity2 infection can be treated , but not cured			2
‘ the findings suggest that there are a lot more of these proviruses that we have to worry about than we thought , ’ said study leader dr @entity34 , from the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 ‘ it does n't mean that it 's hopeless , but it does mean we need to focus on getting an even clearer idea of the scope of the problem			2
’ in patients infected with @entity2 , the virus targets the immune system 's t - cells – white blood cells that help with immunity - where it is integrated into human genes			2
the viral genes contain all the instructions to hijack the t - cell and turn it into a virus - producing factory			0
but in some cells , the virus remains dormant - while sitting in the cell , it is not actively replicating			2
antiretroviral drugs can target active forms of the virus , but it is still unclear whether they are effective against inactive forms			1
until now , scientists did not have an accurate idea of how large the pool of dormant viruses was			0
‘ for people that are working on @entity2 , figuring out the size of the reservoir has been a really critical issue , ’ said dr @entity34			2
‘ the field has struggled with what you even measure in people who are participating in eradication studies			0
how do you know how much virus is left ? ’ dormant @entity2 is now known to pose a far bigger threat than was previously thought because the amount of hidden virus that remains after treatment may be 60 times higher than earlier estimates in the past , scientists have tried to gauge the number of remaining viruses by forcing activation of the dormant viruses			1
this approach did not provided accurate answers			0
the new technique first involved stimulating infected t - cells , which sent a signal to wake up the inactive viruses			1
those proviruses that remained inactive despite the wake - up call were then studied in more detail			0
while 88 per cent contained obvious defects that made it impossible for them to replicate , 12 per cent possessed fully intact viral genomes			0
next , artificial viral genomes were made in the laboratory that matched those in the 12 per cent group			0
the researchers expected to find small mutations that stopped these viruses functioning , but got a shock			0
the sleeping viruses , called proviruses , are a danger because they can become reactivated despite treatment with the best hiv drugs - if this happens , the disease will return ‘ to our surprise , the non-induced proviruses that we judged to be intact based on their genetic sequence all replicated beautifully , ’ said dr @entity34			1
this suggests that many apparently lifeless viruses could be activated in the future causing the patient to fall ill again			2
suspicions were confirmed when the scientists performed a second round of t - cell activation and viruses that had previously remained dormant became active			1
based on the finding that 12 per cent of non-induced proviruses retain an ability to reactivate , the scientists calculated that previous estimates of the size of the dormant hiv store in the body were out by 60 per cent			2
‘ this is a huge increase in the barrier to curing this disease , ’ said dr @entity34			0
even if a patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral drugs that halted all active @entity2 replication , the silent viruses could awaken to cause disease at any point after the therapy is stopped			1
only drugs targeting the inactive viruses could lead to a complete cure or remission , said dr @entity34			1
the scientists ' next goal is to uncover the mechanisms involved in reactivating dormant @entity2 viruses			1
@entity159 , policy director at the hiv / aids charity the @entity160 , said : ‘ prevention is not only better than cure ; it 's also the only viable option we have for the foreseeable future			0
‘ this study shows just one of the challenges researchers need to overcome			0
what is alarming is how many people believe a cure already exists			0
it does n't , and false hope may be leading people to take risks			0
‘ until a cure is found , we have to throw everything we 've got behind hiv prevention			0
using condoms , testing for @entity2 and getting treatment are our best weapons against the virus			1

60 times more ' hidden ' @entity2 remains after treatment that previously thought
it can be ' reactivated ' after treatment causing the disease to return
this finding means only drugs targeting the inactive viruses as well as the active ones could lead to a complete cure
