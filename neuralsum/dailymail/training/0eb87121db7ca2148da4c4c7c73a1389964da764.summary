by @entity0 if the photographer had blinked , he 'd have missed it			0
as vast waves pounded the west country yesterday , one photographer took this astonishing shot			0
for just a split second , the spray from the 30ft wave created the perfect shape of a man 's profile , complete with brow , nose , mouth , chin and even beard			1
the wave then broke over the @entity20 , or harbour wall , at @entity22 , in @entity23 , which has taken a battering in the recent storms			1
communities in @entity36 , @entity37 and in @entity38 are under water after rivers burst their banks and sea defences were breached by high tides rushed in on gale - force gusts			0
at least 5,000 properties are still without power in the south west , and 39,000 homes had to have power restored after winds peaked at 80mph overnight and @entity51 said the violent conditions had caused ' airborne debris ' to fly into overhead lines and made repairs difficult			0
@entity56 confirmed this morning he will chair a meeting of the @entity58 today to discuss the storm damage and the response			1
today storms continued to lash the @entity20 at @entity22 , leaving thousands of homes without power a massive wave smashed against the harbour wall in @entity22 again today , drenching everything in its wake soaking : the cottage on the @entity20 wall was marooned by vast waves which broke all around it			2
