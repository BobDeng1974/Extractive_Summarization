@entity0 is fighting for his @entity2 future as @entity3 insisted he would not allow the striker to compromise @entity6 ’s progress			1
once again @entity0 found himself commanding headlines for all the wrong reasons following @entity6 ’s 3 - 0 defeat by @entity10 , given he had swapped shirts with opposition defender @entity13 as he left the field at half - time			1
it was a naive thing to do and @entity3 stressed that , having spoken to @entity0 in his office at @entity6 ’s @entity19 training base , the ‘ matter was closed ’ and had been dealt with internally			1
@entity0 was back in training for @entity6 on thursday after he controversially swapped shirts with @entity13 the @entity24 's future is the matter of intense scrutiny after he was hooked at half - time in @entity6 's defeat @entity0 battles for the ball with @entity30 as @entity6 turn their attentions back to the @entity32 @entity33 there has been criticism from day one			1
it was a brave move by @entity3			1
he obviously felt his managerial skills could stop the problem			2
it ’s not worked for him or the club			2
this is his last chance at a big club in one of the big leagues and now he ’s looking at @entity45 or somewhere like that			2
@entity47 he still has a future at @entity6			1
the fans are some of the most patient but he has to realise he ’s not playing at just any other club			1
he ’s got to show his commitment by proving it on the pitch			2
you just do n’t do what he did and i ’m sure @entity3 will have a word with him behind closed doors			1
@entity60 on the @entity0 shirt - swapping furore : i doubt they ’re having the same debate in @entity65 re @entity13			1
all is fine when you win			2
ca n’t see the negative in half - time shirt swap			1
does it affect the result ? no. @entity71 @entity0 getting a lot of criticism which is never going to help			1
what he needs is to get his head down and prove people wrong			2
@entity77 i think he would have angered @entity3 when he came into the dressing room wearing a @entity10 shirt			1
i think @entity3 had every reason to take him off , especially at 3 - 0 down			1
i think he did it on purpose			2
i think it was kind of premeditated			2
@entity86 i ’d still start @entity0 at the weekend			1
i ’m not a big fan of his but he has more class than most			2
@entity89 to put all the blame on him			0
most worrying thing is his team - mates ’ body language towards him			1
once you lose their respect it ’s a struggle			0
@entity98 if @entity6 were winning 3 - 0 at half - time , with @entity0 scoring two goals , there would be nothing said			1
losing 3 - 0 , playing poorly then slam @entity0			1
i do n’t agree with what he did but i also think he ’s an easy target			0
but as the dust settled on the incident , the focus shifted to the more important matter of how he played against @entity10 and the way he has performed since joining @entity6 in august and what he has done to justify a £ 16million transfer fee			1
with only one goal in 10 appearances , patience is wearing thin as @entity0 has not provided @entity6 with a focal point and his form has been so underwhelming that @entity3 would not offer any guarantees about how long the 24 - year - old may stay on @entity123			1
@entity0 signed a three - year deal when he arrived from @entity126 and while @entity3 insists he takes ‘ full responsibility ’ for the decision to bring him back to the @entity32 , @entity6 ’s manager will not be so stubborn that he persists with him if the experiment can not work			1
@entity3 said : ‘ the manager always will be — and i certainly am — responsible for every player that comes in			1
so you do n’t need to look too far			0
you ca n’t label it on me , so there is no problem there			0
i think it ’s one which is very clear with the owners and the conversations we had			0
‘ we knew what we were getting			0
i said before this was a calculated risk to bring someone in and nothing has changed			0
i have n’t been overly surprised by many things			0
as i said , we took in a young player who has football potential			0
‘ were we going to get that focus and concentration that is required to play consistently at the top the level ? that is something that remains to be seen			0
and something that only time will tell			2
at this moment in time , he ’s working hard to show he can deliver that			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity0 ’s best is good enough longer term , that remains to be seen			1
he wants to score but , at the minute , he is not			0
when you are confident , you have more success			0
he is treated no different to any other player			0
’ it should be noted at this point that @entity0 — for all the noise that accompanies him — has not been a disruptive presence around the training ground and his behaviour has not been as madcap as it was when he was setting fireworks off in his bathroom during his spell with @entity174			1
when he arrived at the club , @entity0 was told what standards were expected of him but @entity3 will be hoping that his reported brush with the law is not the point at which things start to unravel for @entity180 at @entity2			1
the @entity6 striker walks towards the tunnel at half - time of @entity6 's game against @entity10 with his side trailing 3 - 0 , @entity0 turns to @entity10 defender @entity13 before taking off his @entity6 top the £ 16million signing then gives his shirt to the @entity10 defender prompting outrage among the club 's fans 1			1
one clean sheet in 18 matches and 19 goals conceded in 12 games is a dreadful return			0
between the sticks , @entity200 has regressed in 2014 and looks bereft of confidence			0
where are the goals ? even after accounting for losing star striker @entity206 , @entity6 ’s lack of cutting edge has been dismally apparent			1
manager @entity3 has regularly chopped and changed formations in games to get the right blend			1
5 get the top gun back			0
striker @entity215 ’s absence due to injury has dragged on and it is proving increasingly detrimental			2
on the pitch he is certainly giving @entity3 — who is no closer to welcoming back striker @entity215 — problems			1
his play does not have the intensity that @entity3 demands of those he selects and the balance of the team therefore suffers when one part of the system is not functioning			1
many would be quick to say ‘ we told you so ’ , as @entity0 could not flourish under managers such as @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 and @entity3 accepts he personally will be susceptible to criticism the @entity6 ’s @entity235 continues to underwhelm			1
‘ we brought in the player to give him a chance and give him every chance , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ at this moment in time , of course , he has n’t scored the goals we would like or want			2
we are having to give him that opportunity			0
we will work with the players that we have and he is one of them			0
‘ it is not just about improving him			0
it is about improving all the players			0
and we will see come january what the team needs			0
i ’m the type of manager that gives people an opportunity			0
i understand the criticism that will come my way because of that			0
@entity0 , in action against the @entity65 side on wednesday , has failed to hit the heights since joining from @entity126 the former @entity174 striker looked forlorn at @entity6 's @entity19 training base on thursday ‘ like i said , you accept that as part of being a manager			1
you ’ll take the praise if things go well with a player you are working with			0
and you have to take the responsibility as a manager too			0
either way , i can deal with that			0
‘ he ’s not uncontrollable			0
he ’s certainly not that			0
he ’s an individual talent who is working hard to try to fit into the team ethos here and the team identity			0
but only time will tell			2
he is working hard to try and understand what is required of a @entity6 player			1
’ for all that @entity0 is dominating the agenda , it is not the main issue vexing @entity3			1
an inability to keep clean sheets is proving detrimental to their ambitions but , not only that , it was the comfort with which @entity10 settled into the game that alarmed the manager			0
@entity6 looked flimsy — they only gave six fouls away — and two of the three goals they conceded were cheap			1
‘ i felt we could have been more competitive in certain situations , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ that is the mark of a champion			0
the mark of a champion is how you are competitive against the best opponents			0
it was n’t through want of trying or work ethic			0
but it was an area we could have been better in			0
