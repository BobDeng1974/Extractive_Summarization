a dog trapped underground for four days in a drainage tunnel was rescued when its owner hired a digger to get her out			1
@entity5 the @entity4 disappeared down the unused pipe last friday at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , when owner @entity10 took her for a walk			1
but after darting into the 60cm - wide pipe under a car park she got stuck when she was unable to turn around because of rubble narrowing the tube			0
they advised her to wait it out but as the days passed she became more and more anxious			0
@entity5 , aged five , barked non-stop for four days and kept herself alive by drinking the trickle of water collected at the bottom of the pipe			2
firefighters said there was a risk of the situation becoming hazardous so they stepped in to help with the rescue getting desperate , ms @entity10 decided to hire her own @entity49 to cut the dog free			1
however , a passerby alerted the local fire service and they stepped in and launched a six - hour operation to rescue @entity5			1
a five - strong team used the digger , cutting equipment , spades and shovels to excavate a wide hole to get to the pipe which was more than eight feet underground			2
they then smashed their way into the drain and lifted @entity5 free			0
social worker ms @entity10 said : ' the fire service have been brilliant , it shows there are some really good people about			1
' fire brigade station manager @entity68 said : ' @entity5 's owner had organised her own search , but the situation was in danger of becoming hazardous			1
' we took the decision to carry out this rescue because of our concern for the safety of her search party as well as for @entity32 's welfare			0
' we are obviously delighted that it has had a happy ending			0
' he added : ' it 's quite understandable that an owner , when faced with a situation like this , will want to go to extraordinary lengths to save a pet			0
' but our advice to pet owners is to contact the @entity31 in the event of an incident of this type			0
they will then liaise with us if specialist rescue skills and equipment become necessary			0
' firefighters have now closed off the entrances to the pipe and an adjacent one to prevent a repeat of the drama			2
they eventually managed to get to the tunnel underneath about four feet of earth a rescuer had to get right into the tunnel to pull @entity5 free			2
she had survived by lapping up water that trickled underneath her here she comes : looking remarkably clean and calm , @entity5 emerges from the pipe after a successful rescue @entity5 licking her lips at the thought of an imminent feed , pictured with her owner and a smiling team of firemen still licking her lips , an excitable @entity5 bears the the muddy paw marks that suggest she scraped away at the pipe walls but to no avail			1
thank goodness for mummy and that digger ! it all becomes a bit much for ms @entity10 as the four days ' emotion finally takes it toll and she holds @entity5 tight not letting her out of her sight , ms @entity10 keeps a firm grip on her beloved pet after a tearful reunion and remarkable rescue			1

@entity5 went into drainage tunnel during a walk with owner @entity10
ms @entity10 hired a digger but the fire brigade stepped in and took over
drainage pipe has been closed at both ends to prevent it happening again
