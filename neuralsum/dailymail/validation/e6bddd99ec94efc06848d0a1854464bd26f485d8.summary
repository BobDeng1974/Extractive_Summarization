over the course of his career , @entity1 ’s net - finding abilities have cost clubs in excess of £ 9million in transfer fees			1
once tipped as @entity8 ’s heir apparent during his formative days at @entity9 , he made a fortune in @entity12 football , lost a chunk of it through a well - publicised gambling addiction , and most recently played in the @entity16 with @entity17			1
now , in a move that caused @entity20 football to perform a collective double take , @entity1 has joined @entity23 strugglers @entity22 until the end of the season			1
@entity1 appears for @entity22 for the first time against @entity27 at @entity28 on tuesday the 31 - year - old made his debut as an injury - time substitute during tuesday night ’s 2 - 2 draw with @entity27 at @entity28 , confirming that this remarkable coup by a part - time club had n’t actually been some form of elaborate hoax			1
among the many questions that sprang up from his appearance in a black - and - gold jersey , a simple one seemed the most obvious : why ? ‘ once i finished in @entity46 , my main objective was to get back and i ’ve been looking around at what leagues i could play in , ’ said @entity1 , a former @entity42 youth international who was most prolific during two spells at @entity44			1
‘ the last week i ’ve been training at @entity49 and i got a phone call on monday asking if i would like to come to @entity22 , and i jumped at the chance			1
‘ this is n’t a financial thing because i could have got more money from one of the offers i had in @entity42 but i just want to play and get some goals			0
@entity1 ( right ) comes on as a substitute during the second half of the @entity23 match @entity1 speaks on his phone as he walks on the pitch ahead of the @entity27 match on tuesday ‘ it ’s a challenge for me but , if i can help keep @entity22 in the @entity23 , then it will have been well worth it			1
‘ i ’m also desperate to play in the @entity66 ( against @entity67 on april 5 ) because i ’ve never actually won anything in the game and it would be brilliant if we won that			0
people ask me if i even knew of @entity22 but i did — i actually watched them beat @entity27 3 - 2 on the telly earlier in the season ! ‘ i loved it at @entity28 the other night when i got a couple of minutes			1
i ca n’t believe @entity22 are where they are in the league			1
‘ i ’ve never played in @entity20 before but i thought the standard was good and the fitness levels unbelievable when you consider we ’re part - time			2
‘ honestly , i played for @entity83 admittedly during some hard times for that club ( last season ) but this @entity22 team is better than that @entity83 one			1
@entity8 ( right ) celebrates with @entity1 after scoring for @entity9 against @entity88 in april 2006 ‘ and here at least you know the guys will give 100 per cent			1
you know you will get a shift from the guy next to you and that ’s not always been the case elsewhere			0
’ @entity1 hopes his influence will also be felt outside of match scenarios			1
his aim is to copy the illustrious names who aided his own career by helping develop the more youthful players at @entity104			0
‘ i remember when i was at @entity9 and i was a young boy , i was playing with @entity8 , @entity105 and @entity106 and they gave me the best experience possible , ’ recalled @entity1			1
‘ they made me the player i am today and i ’ll be looking to try and help all the young boys at the club and passing my experience on			2
‘ i will stay up here a lot of the time , although i ’m going back to @entity9 this weekend because my son plays football and i ca n’t miss his game ! ‘ otherwise , i will be up here training and playing , and i ’m hoping to be able to train with @entity119 on a friday if that can be finalised			2
‘ i ’m also going to be coaching the kids on a wednesday night			0
i want to put something back in and community coaching will be good			0
’ @entity1 celebrates a goal for @entity124 against @entity125 at the @entity126 in september 2008 @entity1 ( centre ) in action for @entity44 against @entity129 and @entity130 in the @entity132 first round in 2009 @entity1 ’s advice may also extend to the perils of gambling			1
during a court case in 2013 , he estimated he had blown around £ 2m through the vice			0
he was still a teenager when involved in card games on the @entity9 team bus that could see up to £ 30,000 in cash change hands			2
@entity1 also claimed the main reason he joined @entity124 in 2007 was because the signing - on fee would pay off his debts			1
his situation deteriorated to such a point that he told the court he had been threatened by loan sharks at the @entity149 training ground during a later stint in @entity151			0
@entity1 then sought help from the @entity153 , the facility set up by former @entity42 defender @entity155 to treat behavioural problems such as alcohol , drug and gambling addictions in professional and amateur sports people			2
‘ i ’ve had problems , well - documented ones , in the past but i ’ve moved on , ’ he insisted			0
‘ everyone makes mistakes and i certainly made some but i ’ve put all that behind me			0
i ’m trying to be positive , i ’ve cleaned up my act and i ’m on the straight and narrow			0
’ @entity1 is n’t discounting still being at @entity22 next season and clearly has a genuine hunger to be scoring again after an injury - scarred spell in @entity46			1
@entity1 warms up ahead of a match between @entity83 and @entity173 at @entity174 in february 2014 @entity1 ( left ) plays for @entity17 against @entity175 in the @entity16 last december ‘ that was a great experience , ’ he said			2
‘ my dad is @entity46 , so that made it more interesting as well			0
unfortunately i suffered a hamstring injury early on and then i ruptured my ankle ligaments , but it was still great seeing it all			0
‘ my team - mates included @entity185 and @entity186			0
i spoke to @entity186 about this move the other night and he was very encouraging			0
‘ now i just want to give it my best shot and help @entity22 as much as i can — and if things go well i certainly would n’t rule out staying on			2
‘ but right now i am only thinking about playing and doing well and i have n’t spent too much time thinking of what will happen beyond the summer			0
’ @entity197 to the completion of one of the most fascinating transfers of the season was @entity198 , @entity22 ’s head of player recruitment			2
@entity1 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity22 caretaker manager @entity201 at @entity28 on tuesday ‘ i heard @entity1 could be available through my contacts and , after that , i did a bit of homework — including speaking to @entity206 , who was assistant manager at @entity149 when @entity1 was there — and got glowing references , ’ said @entity198			1
‘ chairman @entity209 was very supportive as always and gave me the go - ahead			0
‘ @entity1 is within our budget			2
he will get the same bonus as the other lads if we stay in the @entity23 and , if he helps us do that , then he will have been well worth the effort			0
‘ we ’ve made a massive statement because we are desperate to stay in this league and then look to do better next season when , who knows , @entity1 could still be with us			1
