some people like to have a few close friends on @entity2 , while others have hundreds who they barely know			1
researchers now believe that the number of friends you have can depend on how successful you are , and even how often you move			1
researchers from the @entity10 and the @entity11 say the ' perfect ' number of friends actually depends on several socioeconomic factors , and varies from country to country			1
researchers believe that the number of @entity2 friends you have can reveal you social status , and how often you move home @entity20 and @entity21 predicted that a broad , shallow networking strategy would be optimal for people living in a residentially mobile , economically favorable context			1
a narrow , deep networking strategy , on the other hand , would be optimal if people tend to stay in one place and economic conditions are n’t as favorable			0
@entity31 , a psychology professor in the @entity10 ’s @entity33 , and @entity21 of the @entity11 explored the benefits of social networking strategies in two studies currently published in the journal @entity38 , a journal of the @entity40			0
' in the age of @entity2 , many @entity42 seem to opt for a broad , shallow networking strategy , ' they say			1
' yet cross-cultural research has shown that having many friends is not always viewed positively outside the @entity42			1
' one reason that @entity42 may prefer a large social network , the researchers claim , is because @entity42 move around a lot			1
another important factor may be the economic conditions at a given time			0
' when times are prosperous , your friends are less likely to need much help , whether it ’s covering a hospital bill or providing babysitting , and so a broad network of friends is easy to maintain , ' they claim			1
' but when times are n’t as flush , having more friends might incur huge costs in terms of both time and resources			1
' @entity20 and @entity21 predicted that a broad , shallow networking strategy would be optimal for people living in a residentially mobile , economically favorable context			0
a narrow , deep networking strategy , on the other hand , would be optimal if people tend to stay in one place and economic conditions are n’t as favorable			0
in the first study , they created a model that simulated the benefits individuals receive from their social network under various socioeconomic conditions			0
the researchers were able to simulate people who have different numbers of friends at different levels of friendship , and they were also able to account for the investment required by each type of friendship			1
the team say the ' perfect ' number of friends of @entity2 depends of several socioeconomic factors - with those who move around a lot likely to have more friends as they predicted , they found that having a small social network with deep ties to friends is advantageous when friends are not likely to move away and the economy is unstable			1
regardless of economic conditions , having a broad social network with weak ties to friends is advantageous when friends are likely to move away			2
@entity20 and @entity21 conducted a second study to investigate whether this pattern of results would hold up in the real world			0
they recruited 247 @entity42 to participate in an online survey through @entity118 ’s @entity117			0
the survey was designed to parallel the computer simulation from the first study			0
the participants were asked to list three different kinds of friends : very close , close and distant			2
in order to get a sense of the participants ’ social networking strategy , the researchers asked them to imagine that their time , energy and money were limited to 60 points and to distribute the points among their three types of friends			1
the researchers say social networking strategies can reveal more than expected about people they also assessed participants ’ subjective well - being through a combination of three measures : life satisfaction , experiences of positive emotions and lack of experiences of negative emotions			2
finally , the researchers used census data to obtain information about residential mobility and median family income in each postcode			2
the findings from the second study echoed those of the first study			0
in postcodes in which residents were stable and had relatively low incomes , participants who had a narrow , deep friendship strategy reported greater well - being than those who had a broad , shallow friendship strategy			0
notably , the broad , shallow strategy was associated with subjective well - being in all three of the other economic conditions ( low income - unstable , high income - stable , high income - unstable )			0
@entity20 and @entity21 argue that these two studies provide clear evidence for the role of socioeconomic factors – such as residential mobility and economic security – in determining the most adaptive networking strategy			2
' as residential mobility decreases and economic recession deepens in the @entity42 , the optimal social - networking strategy might shift from the broad - but - shallow to the narrow - but - deep , even in a nation known best for the strength of weak ties , ' the researchers conclude .			2

researchers say the ' perfect ' number of friends varies between countries
claim factors *including* the *availability* of friends for babysitting or even money *lending* can impact the number of @entity2 friends a person has
