a mysterious person has been photographed for the first time after apparently wandering around a patch of woodland for the past 10 years			2
the figure , who is known as ' @entity6 ' and has been called @entity8 's answer to the @entity9 , wears a military uniform and a thick cloak , with a gas mask covering his or her face			1
while he does not seem to be obviously aggressive or dangerous , police are hoping to speak to @entity6 in an effort to encourage him to be less threatening			1
tales of @entity6 have been reported in the woods of @entity22 in western @entity8 for the past decade , apparently walking the same route every day			1
spotted : ' @entity6 ' has been photographed for the first time after a decade spent wandering the woods however , last month @entity27 published what is believed to be the first ever photograph of the figure			1
' i came across him near the marches , ' said the unnamed amateur photographer who tracked him down			0
' i approached him up to a dozen metres away			0
' he had a military cape , boots and an army gas mark - an antique type , i think			2
he measured more than 1.90m			0
he stared at me then turned his back on me and left in silence			0
' one local resident encountered @entity6 in june last year - when the creature appeared to be clutching a bunch of flowers			1
@entity46 , who also lives in the area , told @entity27 that her run - in with him came in spring			2
' it was a rainy sunday , ' she said			0
' he had a cap , a dark cloak and his gas mask			0
' what could possibly be going through his head ? i do n't know , but it was unforgettable - and unpleasant			2
i hope i do n't run into him again			0
' scary : many locals are now reluctant to visit the forest of @entity22 in western @entity8 others testified that @entity6 had terrified their children with his unusual appearance , while it is said that some women are scared to visit the woods alone			1
' families simply wo n't go into the forest any more , ' a farmer said , adding that @entity6 had been seen regularly over 10 years			1
' no one here finds this story funny			0
' there have been a number of theories as to the figure 's true identity - a mentally ill woman , a gigantic man , or someone suffering from a nasty skin condition			1
others suggest that @entity6 has deliberately chosen a hermit 's life , perhaps because he is a ' survivalist ' obsessed with the apocalypse			2
