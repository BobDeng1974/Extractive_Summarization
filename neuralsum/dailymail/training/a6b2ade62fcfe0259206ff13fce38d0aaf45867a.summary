monday : spaghetti bolognese tuesday : @entity49 wednesday : pork chops thursday : lasagne friday : @entity52 ( pictured below ) saturday : stir - fry sunday : roast dinner ' eating the same meals week after week for years on end does n't sound very appealing , although it 's easy to see how we become stuck in a rut			1
