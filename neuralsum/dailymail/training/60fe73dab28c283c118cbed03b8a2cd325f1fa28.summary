by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:25 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 22 may 2013 @entity2 is expected to join @entity3 on a permanent deal after @entity5 agreed to take a £ 20million loss on the striker			1
while @entity2 is yet to say yes to the move , @entity3 have had a bid of £ 15m agreed in principle by @entity5 for a forward who cost a record £ 35m for a @entity13 player when he signed from @entity14 in january 2011			1
@entity2 is believed to be keen on moving to @entity15 but the club want a definite answer from him by the end of next week			1
@entity19 calling ? @entity2 could move permanently to @entity3 after the club agreed a fee with @entity5 the 6ft 3in @entity2 yesterday pulled out of @entity22 ’s squad for the friendlies against the @entity24 and @entity25 because of injury			1
he had been recalled by head coach @entity27 last week but suffered a heel problem in the @entity3 ’ final game of the season against @entity31			2
scans have shown he needs complete rest			0
@entity27 was keen to use the friendlies to take another look at @entity2 , who has been in outstanding form for @entity3 during the last few weeks of his season - long loan under @entity38			1
the @entity3 boss admitted at the weekend that signing @entity2 had become his top priority after his partnership with midfielder @entity42 flourished			2
@entity5 have reluctantly agreed to sell @entity2 but @entity43 does not believe the target man has a future at @entity46			2
he struggled to make an impact after he was signed when @entity5 wanted a replacement for @entity49			0
cooled off : @entity14 had previously shown an interest in bringing @entity2 back to the @entity51 although his initial £ 65,000 a week salary was comparatively low , his transfer fee for an unproven @entity54 player was incredible at the time			1
he scored only four goals for @entity5 in the @entity54 and has spent the majority of this campaign on loan with the @entity3			2
although the @entity3 board have reservations about his injury record , they are determined to back @entity38 ’s transfer plans			0
@entity65 looks set to leave @entity3 after saying goodbye to the fans on @entity67			0
‘ life is filled with ups & downs today is a down but i ’ll be back ! @entity65 / @entity74 as i have been called has left the building			0
i want to thank the @entity3 fans for their support especially the 1 ’s who made the away games feel like a home 1			0
# @entity80 ’ @entity3 have agreed to sign @entity82 defender @entity81 on an initial two - year deal when his contract with @entity85 expires on july 1			2
the 31 - year - old left back has 88 caps			0
the @entity3 have also held talks with @entity90 ’s out - of - contract captain @entity89 , who will be 36 next week			0
meanwhile , @entity2 has pulled out of @entity22 's international friendlies with @entity25 and the @entity24 suffering a heel injury			1
kop that : the @entity14 - born striker was set to return to his parent club after a year on loan in @entity19 @entity97 understands the striker will be out for at least six weeks			1
the @entity22 are scheduled to face the @entity24 on may 29 at @entity98 followed by a game with @entity25 in @entity100 on june 2			2
@entity27 , who named his squad last thursday , will now have to manage without the services of @entity2 who ended the season as @entity3 's second top goalscorer with seven league strikes to his name			1
@entity27 is treating the matches as dress rehearsals for september 's @entity111 games against @entity112 and @entity113			0
he said : ' everything i do will have an eye on the qualifiers			0
' @entity22 expects : @entity2 has pulled out of the national squad to take on @entity25 and the @entity24 but @entity2 becomes the latest high - profile player to pull out a squad that is already without captain @entity121 and @entity123 's @entity122 - possibly the side 's two most influential players			1
@entity126 was added to the @entity22 squad on monday after the @entity129 midfielder scored twice in his side 's disappointing 3 - 2 defeat at home by @entity133			1
he appears to have sufficiently impressed manager hodgson to have earned a late call with @entity136 a significant doubt in an already understrength squad			0
beyond @entity140 and @entity141 , the team will severely lack top - level experience in midfield .			0
