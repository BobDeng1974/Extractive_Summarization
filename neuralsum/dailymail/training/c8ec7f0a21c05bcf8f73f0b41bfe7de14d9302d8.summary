good results : pensioners and teenagers are the happiest in @entity43 , according to results of a @entity46 survey released today , which is costing £ 2 million the report , released yesterday , found that those in their 40s and 50s were unhappier , more dissatisfied and more likely to feel anxious than teenagers or pensioners			1

happy bunny : @entity2 wants to find out how @entity43 really feel so the government can do a better job it has already been criticised for some of its initial findings , including the rather predictable conclusions that the employed are happier than the unemployed and those who suffer poor health are more anxious than those in good health			1
yesterday a @entity67 spokesman said : ‘ this is a statement of the bleeding obvious , a waste of taxpayers ’ money and it makes ministers look even more out of touch			0
’ the 165,000 participants were asked how happy and anxious they felt the day before , how satisfied they were with life and how worthwhile they thought their lives were			0
the findings show that the middle - aged are the worst - off generation in terms of well - being			1
‘ research has shown a @entity37 relationship between life satisfaction ratings and age group , ’ the report said			0
‘ overall higher ratings of subjective well - being are reported by younger and older people , and lower ratings are reported by those in the middle years			1
’ men and women aged between 45 and 54 rated their life satisfaction at 7.1 out of ten			2
by contrast , teenagers and those between 65 and 80 marked themselves at 7.8 out of ten			2
when it came to anxiety , the u-shape was turned upside down			0
nearly a quarter of those aged between 45 and 60 gave an anxiety rating of six out of ten			2
but bearing a greater level of responsibility gave the middle - aged a sense their lives were worthwhile			2
@entity109 , of @entity110 , the over- 50s group , said : ‘ those coming up to traditional retirement age are clearly more anxious and less satisfied with their lives than those already retired			0

’ lord @entity120 , the former cabinet secretary behind the survey , said the results showed it is ' bliss ' to work outdoors			0

those who were married were the most satisfied , with 82 per cent recording medium to high levels			0
cohabitees came next , on 79.4 per cent , followed by single people , on 71.2 per cent , and the divorced , on 60.7 per cent			2
but the @entity53 said it was ' difficult to say ' whether marriage makes people happier , or happier people are more likely to marry			1
the report said that ministers intend to use its findings to help direct government spending towards people with low levels of well - being			2
@entity147 , head of the @entity148 , said : ' by examining and analysing both objective statistics as well as subjective information , a more complete picture of national well - being can be formed			0
' understanding people 's views of well - being is an important addition to existing official statistics and has potential uses in the policy making process			0
