if you have ever grimaced at your petrol bill and dreamed of a car that runs on fresh air , your prayers are about to be answered			1
@entity7 car giant @entity6 believes it can put an air - powered vehicle on the road by 2016			1
its scientists say it will knock 45 per cent off fuel bills for an average motorist			0
and when driving in towns and cities costs could be slashed by as much as 80 per cent because the car will be running on air for four - fifths of the time			1
saving the planet : the @entity22 technology could allow a car the size of a @entity25 or @entity26 to emit as little as 69g/km of co2 cutting costs : a look inside the ' air engine ' which could cut 45 per cent off the petrol bill for the average driver the system works by using a normal internal combustion engine , special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy			1
this enables it to run on petrol or air , or a combination of the two			1
air power would be used solely for city use , automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘ 60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving ’			2
by 2020 , the cars could be achieving an average of 117 miles a gallon , the company predicts			1
the air compression system can re-use all the energy normally lost when slowing down and braking			1
the motor and a pump are in the engine bay , fed by a compressed air tank underneath the car , running parallel to the exhaust			1
the revolutionary new ‘ @entity22 ’ engine system – the first to combine petrol with compressed air – is a breakthrough for hybrid cars because expensive batteries will no longer be needed			1
lift - off : the air power will be automatically activated below 43mph and can be used for up to 80 per cent of driving time in urban areas cars fitted with @entity22 will be about £ 1,000 cheaper to buy than current hybrid models			1
for more than two years , 100 elite scientists and engineers have been working on the air - powered car in top - secret conditions at @entity26 ’s research and development centre at @entity77 , just south of @entity78			1
@entity22 is the centrepiece of @entity26 chief executive @entity81 ’s efforts to restore the fortunes of the historic car maker			1
the revolutionary system will be able to be installed on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size or reducing the boot size , provided the spare wheel is not stored there			1
from the outside , an air - powered car will look identical to a conventional vehicle			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are not talking about weird and wacky machines			0
these are going to be in everyday cars			0
’ @entity26 , which unveiled its prototype yesterday , envisages introducing it in smaller models such as the 208 at first			0
running on air : the @entity26 is one model that may use the air engine technology in future the company said that as well as being greener and cheaper to run , the air system created no extra dangers in a collision			1
motorists never run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically			2
the air compresses and decompresses of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down			2
spacious interior : allows for full - sized passenger compartment without surrendering boot volume			0
driving comfort and road handling : @entity22 promises to deliver nimble response with the boost effect as well as first - class road handling thanks to its automatic transmission			2
worldwide potential : the technology is viable in all markets , making it possible for energy efficient cards in all types of climate and regardless of the state of the roads			2
boot : no space for a spare tyre once the @entity22 motor is installed			2
as well as the revolutionary air car , @entity26 also unveiled plans for new larger cars such as the @entity148 and the @entity149 that will save 20per cent on fuel bill through the use of new materials such as lightweight steel and aluminuim composites			1
they will also deploy other innovations such as electric power steering instead of hydraulic and new tyres with reduced drag			0
these will be introduced from this year			0
the first cars to feature them will be the replacement for the @entity163 produced at the company ’s plant in @entity166 and the replacement for the 308 built at @entity168 in @entity7			2
the audience gasped as the covers were removed from the prototypes at a packed ceremony attended by @entity7 politicians and business leaders			0
the innovations are crucial to chairman @entity81 ’s efforts to revamp the ailing automaker that has suffered badly due to the crisis in southern european markets including @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity166 that account for a large chunk of its sales			0
the economy in its home market of @entity7 has also been hard hit in the single currency crisis			2
it has lost its triple - a credit rating and socialist president @entity190 has earned international ridicule through his plans for a supertax on the wealthy			0
the @entity26 company was founded in 1810 and the family still has a controlling stake			0
@entity197 drafted in @entity198 - widely hailed in the @entity199 for rescuing @entity200 , the former @entity201 , from the brink of ruin - in 2009			0
@entity81 ’s attempts to revive the marque have been hit by the euro meltdown and militant @entity7 unions			0
worldwide sales for 2012 were down 8.8per cent to 2.82m			0
the company has been hindered in efforts to improve its performance by @entity7 ’s rigid labour laws			0
it has also been plagued by violent industrial action at its @entity214 plant near @entity78 which is due to close next year with the loss of thousands of jobs			0
it is embroiled in controversy with rival @entity219 car makers over a @entity7 state guarantee given to its financing arm last year .			0
