by @entity0 published : 15:00 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 17:59 est , 9 august 2013 a tax hike on cigarettes makes the vulnerable drink less alcohol , according to a new study			2
researchers found that those closed as ' vulnerable ' - excessive drinkers , young and less well off smokers - consume less alcohol if the price of tobacco is increased			1
in the first study of its kind , experts at @entity14 found a ' modest to moderate ' reduction in alcohol intake when smoking becomes more expensive			1
link : when taxes on cigarettes are increased , vulnerable groups , including younger smokers and heavy drinkers , consume less alcohol , according to a new study ( pictures posed by models ) professor @entity30 said : ' smoking and heavy drinking co-occur at alarmingly high rates			1
' @entity33 can enhance the subjective effects of alcohol and has been shown to increase the risk for heavy and problematic drinking			0
' smokers drink more frequently and more heavily than non-smokers , and are substantially more likely than non-smokers to meet criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence			0
' the results of the study , published in the journal @entity46 : @entity47 , added that the health risks are greatly increased when alcohol and tobacco are consumed together			1
it also found that an increase in tax on cigarettes leads to less people taking up smoking , more people quitting and a decrease in the number of smoking related deaths			0
professor @entity30 added : ' cigarette taxes have broad population reach and have been recognized as one of the most significant policy instruments to reduce smoking			0
dangerous : the study found that the risk to health is far greater when alcohol and cigarettes are consumed together ( pictured posed by model ) ' by increasing the price of cigarettes , taxes are thought to encourage smokers to reduce their use of cigarettes or quit altogether , and discourage non-smokers from starting to smoke			1
' the study looked at interviews with more than 21,000 drinkers as part of a large scale @entity86 study			0
while the results suggest that an increase in taxes on cigarrettes stopped male drinkers consuming as much alcohol , that effect was increased among heavy male drinkers , young adults and those with the lowest income			2
dr @entity99 , of @entity100 , said : ' these findings suggest that if states increase taxes on cigarettes , they are not only likely to reduce smoking - based on a large body of literature - but they also may have a modest impact on heavy drinking rates among men , those with lower income , and those who drink most heavily			0

a @entity14 study found the link between taxes and alcohol consumption
excessive drinkers , young and less well off smokers drank less if tobacco taxes went up
the study also found that the health effects are *worse* when smoking at drinking at the same time
