by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 police hunting for @entity5 have today started searching @entity1 's sewer network as it emerged they need at least another week to scour land 300 metres from where she vanished			1
@entity12 detectives working in the @entity14 resort have pulled up manhole covers and are analysing the network of pipes below using micro cameras and fibre - optic cables			1
police have yet to say whether they have found anything significant , but @entity23 's parents - @entity24 and @entity25 - today said they were ' encouraged by the progress ' of the search			1
it is believed to have been used by children playing in the area for years the sewer system being searched was installed as part of failed plans to build a hotel on the site before @entity23 disappeared in 2007 , but after a planning battle it remained wasteland			1
the search of the area for clues to what happened to the three - year - old from @entity56 is expected to go into a second week after @entity58 police were granted an extra seven days by the @entity60 authorities to keep searching			1
sources said detectives had not realised just how hard and dry the land would be where they have been digging for clues			1
the extension may also have been granted after surprise finds at the first site , where a large concealed shaft was discovered by sniffer dogs			0
the hole has now been cleared after forensic teams removed ‘ non organic ’ materials from inside			0
local reports suggested clothing had been found in what was a discarded play den for children			0
officers also believed they had come across a burial site late on wednesday but this has since reportedly been ruled out as an area of interest			2
bones have been discovered on the site but tests showed they were from cows and pigs			0
@entity12 has refused to provide ‘ a running commentary ’ on whether any leads have so far been found			2
experienced : seven - year - old @entity91 springer spaniels ' @entity89 and @entity92 ' from @entity93 , who helped hunt for @entity95 , were back on the land for a fourth day hot work : the dogs were covered in water and a wet blanket as their handlers ensure they did not overheat in the @entity14 sun however , @entity103 and mrs @entity104 today wrote online to well - wishers saying they are ' encouraged by the progress ' ‎ of searches for their missing daughter			1
@entity113 on the couple 's official find @entity110 , @entity24 and @entity25 said : ' we are kept updated on the on - going work in @entity60 and are encouraged by the progress			1
' thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get @entity23 home			2
' ‎ mr and mrs @entity104 , who have not travelled to @entity1 , were previously said to have been bracing themselves for ' significant news '			1
today a group of officers lifted a manhole cover and lowered what appeared to be a camera attached to a long pole down it			2
one of them wrote notes as they looked inside , around 20ft ( 6metres ) from where the radar equipment was used yesterday			0
they then moved over to a section of grass nearby and lifted another cover , with an officer lying on his front on the ground to reach inside			0
meanwhile sniffer dogs used to hunt for murdered schoolgirl april @entity143 were again on the site hunting for evidence			0
the seven - year - old @entity91 springer spaniels – @entity89 and @entity92 – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time			0
yesterday they uncovered concealed shaft covered with corrugated iron , yards from the spot where @entity5 vanished			0
@entity12 moved in to seal off the area with large white tents			1
forensic approach : police have split the wasteland into at least 12 areas of interest , using dogs , scanning equipment and fingertip searches vantage point : at the centre of the search site is a hill , where officers on horses and also with telescopes are taking advantage of the height to look for evidence five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence			1
the shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was covered with wooden planks , a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of earth			0
a local source said : ‘ the discovery of the hole came as a surprise			0
police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay things			0
’ the area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine			2
it was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen walking in the direction of the site on the night that @entity23 was last seen alive			2
investigation : @entity23 ’s parents @entity24 , 46 , and 45 - year - old @entity25 have not travelled to @entity60 but are being kept closely informed and are said to expect ' significant news ' on their daughter map : the search site is 300 metres from the apartment at the @entity213 resort in @entity1 and the tapas bar her parents were dining at and close to where a suspect was seen with a girl in his arms on the night she was abducted in may 2007			1
