by @entity0 it 's left the government 's top code breakers stumped - but maybe can you decipher the secret message sent by @entity7 soldiers during @entity8 ? the unopened scroll was found attached to the remains of a carrier pigeon at house in @entity13 in august			1
it is believed the bird swooped down on the chimney for a rest during its long journey from @entity20 - occupied @entity19 down for video shock : @entity23 with the remains of a carrier pigeon which he discovered behind his fireplace but sadly , the brave ' spy ' pigeon then fell off its perch and died with the vital message still wrapped to its leg			1
expert hictorians at @entity32 , who have been trying to decipher the code for weeks unsuccessfully , say it may never be cracked			1
they are now turning the mystery over to the public in the hope that someone may know the secret to unlock the mystery			1
the message , hidden in a red cylinder , lay undiscovered in the chimney for around 70 years until the home ’s current owner @entity23 decided to restore the fireplace			1
‘ the chimney was full of twigs and rubbish , ’ he said			2
‘ we were stunned by how much came out			0
then i started finding bits of a dead pigeon			0
we thought it might be a racing pigeon until we spotted the red capsule			0
’ the former probation officer and his wife @entity57 , both 74 , unscrewed the capsule and found a hand - written message inside on a ‘ cigarette paper thin ’ piece of paper			1
it was sent to code breakers at @entity65 in @entity66 , the intelligence centre where work to crack the @entity70 code shortened the war by years , and to their modern - day counterparts at @entity32 in @entity74 , @entity75 , who also tried to decipher it			1
history : historians believe the message , ( left ) which was written by a sergeant @entity82 , will provide unique insight into the war			1
it was discovered rolled up in the red capsule attached to the pigeon ( right ) complex : the message contains 27 codes , each made up of combinations of five numbers and letters the bird could have been on its way to wartime decoding hq @entity65 , in @entity66 ( pictured )			1
code - crackers have been frantically trying to decipher the message , which never reached its intended recipient carrier pigeons have been used for centuries and were used in both world wars to convey military messages			1
they can reach speeds of 80mph and distances of 700 miles			0
the @entity108 trained 250,000 birds in @entity8 , forming the @entity110			0
the were so relied upon that the government even introduced a special @entity108 squadron to cull falcons and hawks who attacked them			0
the birds would be dropped into @entity20 occupied @entity117 using mini parachutes			0
they were then picked up and secret messages were inserted into capsules on their legs			2
the birds would then fly hundreds of miles back home			2
when they landed , wires in the coop would sound a bell or buzzer and a soldier of the @entity130 would know a message had arrived			2
he would go to the coop , remove the message from the canister , and send it to its destination by telegraph , field phone , or personal messenger			2
thirty two pigeons were even decorated with the @entity142 during the war years - the animal equivalent of the @entity145			0
among them was @entity147 - a pigeon who carried out more than ninety missions during the war			0
another was @entity153 who was the first bird to deliver intelligence from an agent in enemy - occupied @entity157 in october 1940			0
@entity158 delivered an @entity160 message from a ditched aircrew 288 miles in 7.5 hours in 1942			2
mr @entity23 said : ' i always understood there was no code that could n't be cracked			1
i am beginning to think this message contains highly - sensitive orders			2
' experts from @entity168 intelligence agency @entity32 said the message , which has 27 five - letter code groups , is impossible to crack without its codebook			1
they were also left stumped by missing details , such as the date of the message and the identities of the sender , ' @entity177 ' , and the recipient , ' @entity179 '			2
a spokesman said : ' although it is disappointing that we can not yet read the message brought back by a brave carrier pigeon , it is a tribute to the skills of the wartime code - makers that , despite working under severe pressure , they devised a code that was indecipherable both then and now			1
' a @entity32 historian told the @entity193 help from the public is the best hope for any breakthrough			1
' there are still quite a lot of people alive who worked in communications centres during the war and who might have some knowledge about this and it would be very interesting if anyone did have information if they could put it in the pot and we could see if we could get any further with it , ' he said			0
some 250,000 pigeons were deployed in the @entity8			0
able to fly at a mile a minute , they carried messages from behind enemy lines and , like a forerunner of the ‘ black box ’ , accompanied @entity108 bomber crews in case they crashed			0
experts say the red capsule mr @entity23 found is the type used by the @entity223			1
their human agents undertook sabotage missions such as blowing up trains , bridges and factories in @entity230 - occupied territory			0
the message was written by a sergeant @entity232 and contains columns of groups of five letters			2
it is thought that its intended recipient , ‘ @entity238 ’ , is code for @entity240			0
one theory is that the message may have been requesting a bombing raid somewhere			0
another is that the pigeon was bound for @entity247 ’s hq in @entity248 , @entity13 , from where he planned the d - day landings			1
homing pigeons were taken on the d - day invasion and released by @entity253 to keep generals back on @entity256 shores updated on the operation			0
some pigeons were based at @entity65 , which is now a museum			0
but @entity265 , curator of its permanent ‘ @entity266 ’ exhibition , said all of the pigeon messages in its archives are in long - hand , not code			0
‘ the message mr @entity23 found must be highly top secret , ’ mr @entity265 said			1
‘ the aluminium ring found on the bird ’s leg tells us it was born in 1940 , and we know it ’s an @entity253 pigeon because of the red capsule it was carrying , but that ’s all we know			0
’ en route : experts believe the pigeon and coded message may have been flying back from @entity20 to @entity280 in @entity248 , @entity13			1
@entity247 is pictured in 1944 stumped : historical experts at @entity32 have been unable to crack the wartime code video : @entity23 talks about the moment he discovered the remains of a @entity8 homing pidgeon behind his chimney			1

it was discovered by @entity23 , 74 , in the chimney of his @entity13 home in august
expert historians at @entity32 have been unable to crack the code
truth of the secret message may never be known
