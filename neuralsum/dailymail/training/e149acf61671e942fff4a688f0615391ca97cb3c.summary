by @entity0 and @entity1 unusual : funeral organiser @entity2 used air conditioning in her vehicle to preserve a man 's body in @entity8 a pair of funeral directors had to store a body of a 200kg man in their car overnight after a @entity8 hospital rejected the corpse because it was too big			1
initially the couple - funeral organiser @entity17 and her partner @entity16 - wanted to store the man at @entity19 , but were told by staff it would not fit in the fridge			2
last wednesday when the body was refused , ms @entity2 and mr @entity16 had to drive almost 200km from @entity25 to @entity26			1
but on arrival the body was unable to be moved because the equipment to transport it from the car was already being used by another corpse			1
ms @entity2 said clear communication from @entity26 staff could have stopped them driving there and back , with the body in the car			1
the owners of @entity39 had no other choice but to preserve the man 's corpse by using their car 's air conditioning			2
they had to kept the car running throughout the night , burning through three tanks of fuel , until they were able to get a chilling container the next morning to store the body in			1
' it was about 8pm when we got to @entity52 and then we had turn the car around and go back home with the deceased in the car , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' we had to check on him every half hour because it was just sitting in the driveway and to keep the temperature down			0
' a corpse should be kept between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees for the first couple of days			2
but ms @entity2 said this was not the first incident of its kind			2
a year ago , the same issue came up and ms @entity2 had alerted health officials to the problem then , but it still had not been addressed			2
' the initial incident happened about a year ago and we turned up with a 250kg man at the @entity73 , ' she said			0
' the hospital services manager took one look at him and basically said he ’s too fat he wo n’t fit in the car in front of two police officers and my husband and myself			0
' that 's the kind of offhand comment we had to deal with			0
' we have a population that is larger and it ’s not just going to go away			0
' not equipped : a spokesperson for @entity26 ( pictured ) said they ' only have equipment for storing bodies weighing up to 150kg ' long journey : ms @entity2 drove to the morgue at @entity26 , @entity90 , @entity52 , she then had to drive to hours back to her home in @entity25 with the body still in the car ms @entity2 said the hospital 's past failure to act was disrespecting the deceased and their family			1
' if it was your child or relative in my car , you would n’t like that , ' she said			0
' they go through a rough enough time without having to worry about where to store their body			2
' @entity111 regional director @entity109 told @entity112 : ' currently the @entity26 only has equipment for storing bodies weighing up to 150kg and is not equipped to transfer bodies in caskets			1
' special arrangements have to be made to store bodies weighing more and for those in caskets , ' he said			1
' we will investigate installing equipment which has a capacity of up to 300kg			0
' he also explained that ms @entity2 ' arrangement to store bodies at the hospital morgue was on a ' good will ' basis			1
' @entity130 does not have body storage facilities in @entity132 and @entity133 and therefore the hospital mortuaries have assisted			0
however ; the @entity136 funeral director does have storage			1
shocking : the body of a 200 - kilogram man was kept inside @entity141 's car last wednesday night after the morgue refused to take it ' the @entity109 staff will meet with representatives of @entity39 to develop a formal agreement for receiving and storing deceased persons at @entity26			1
this is currently carried out on a good will basis and there is no fee for this service			0
' @entity26 staff have assisted with the transfer and handling of deceased persons from @entity39 and when the @entity157 has not been available staff have conducted viewings for the deceased ’s family , ' mr @entity111 said			0
he added : ' it is imperative that at all times a deceased person is treated with the utmost care and respect and viewings are arranged so as not to cause distress and inconvenience to grieving families			0
we endeavour to do this in all @entity172 hospitals			0
' ms @entity2 was hopeful a positive result would come out of talks with them and the health service .			0
