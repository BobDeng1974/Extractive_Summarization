@entity0 was in a @entity2 courtroom tuesday following an incident that happened this past summer in a @entity2 restaurant			1
@entity0 was out enjoying a night of sushi in @entity2 with some pals and his bodyguard , @entity9 ' @entity8 , on june 1 when a man started heckling the group			1
@entity12 , 28 , claims he approached the group to speak with a friend he knew and was then told by @entity15 to get on his way			2
then , towards the end of the evening , @entity15 overheard @entity12 bad mouthing him to someone over the phone , and a heated argument began			1
a manager tried to break it up , and then , as can be seen in the surveillance video , @entity8 punches @entity12 in the eye			0
he reportedly suffered multiple facial fractures and needed several stitches			0
celebrating : @entity15 and @entity23 seemed to be in good spirits as they left the courtroom all set : the @entity49 moved to dismiss the charges against @entity23 on tuesday @entity51 : @entity0 and his bud @entity52 in @entity54 this may @entity12 then sued the restaurant , @entity55 by @entity56 , which @entity15 is a partial owner of , for leaking a tape of the incident to @entity61			1
then , in august , @entity23 the contractor was arrested for the incident by police and identified in a lineup by @entity12			1
he was charged with assault , which is why he and @entity0 appeared in court on tuesday along with @entity0 's lawyer , @entity20			2
the @entity49 ultimately moved to dismiss all charges on tuesday			2
this is no doubt partially because of the tragic turn this all took on october 3 when @entity73 was shot dead in his mother 's @entity2 home after charging at two police officers with a knife			1
they had been called to the house , in the @entity81 section of @entity2 , by his mother , @entity82 , after he barged in and began choking her following an argument			0
on his way : there is more drama on the horizon for @entity0 , who gets into a big fight with pal @entity52 on this week 's episode of @entity91 and @entity92 take the @entity93 letting her have it : @entity0 tells @entity52 to ' go fu * k herself ' after she accuses him of leaking tabloid stories in other @entity15 drama , the former publicist will be going toe - to - toe with best friend @entity52 on this week 's episode of @entity91 and @entity101 after the girls all accuse him of leaking private information about them to the tabloids			0
and while no fists will be flying , @entity15 does tell @entity52 at one point , ' go f -- k yourself			0
' @entity15 has been palling around @entity109 with @entity52 's mother @entity110 all week though , so it seems that everyone made up in the end .			0

@entity0 and his bodyguard @entity22 appeared in a @entity2 courtroom on tuesday
