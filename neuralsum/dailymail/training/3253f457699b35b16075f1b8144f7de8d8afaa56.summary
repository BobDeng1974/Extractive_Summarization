@entity0 , 55,was offered experimental treatment after suffering a heart attack in february after @entity0 had a heart attack in february , he was given a unique chance for a new life			1
surgeons at the @entity7 offered the 55 - year - old experimental therapy that involved injecting his own stem cells into the damaged organ			1
this was done in the hope that it would encourage his heart to repair itself			1
the injected stem cells should prevent the heart ’s muscle tissue from becoming increasingly damaged after suffering a lack of oxygen during the heart attack			1
and it seems to have worked			0
‘ after the heart attack , i had 21 per cent of my heart muscle functioning , as opposed to the normal 61 per cent , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ when i was tested a few months ago , that figure was up to 37 per cent and i believe it ’s still improving			2
’ researchers behind the new technique hope it will increase the survival rate from heart attacks by a quarter			1
@entity0 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , is now back working at his family landscaping business with his sons , @entity35 , 31 , and @entity36 , 28 , and goes to the gym regularly			2
his treatment is the latest in a new wave of stem cell therapies that could become everyday treatments for many conditions			0
stem cells have been discussed for more than 15 years as a future ‘ cure ’ for many ills			1
but concerns about the use of stem cells taken from embryos slowed up their introduction			1
these issues have been overcome , mainly because scientists have discovered how to transform adult patients ’ bone marrow cells into stem cells			1
so now they are being used in a multitude of ways			0
surgeons now use stem cells as a treatment for strokes , blindness , cancers and arthritic hips and knees , as well as a way to grow artificial blood for emergency transfusions			1
stem cells — the basic ‘ building block ’ form of the cells that make up our bodies — are capable of developing into different tissue types , and those from bone marrow can now be made to grow , or ‘ differentiate ’ , into heart muscle cells			1
when @entity0 was offered the chance to try the new treatment it seemed too good an opportunity to turn down			1
before his heart problems , @entity0 ate healthily , drank only occasionally and never smoked			2
but he had suffered extreme emotional trauma			0
‘ the medical team believe that the heart attack was caused by the stress of seeing my 16 - year - old son , @entity89 , die in a light aircraft crash at @entity91 in 2006 , ’ he says			1
‘ i used to go to bed crying and wake up crying			0
’ on the night of the heart attack , @entity0 awoke at 2am with pain in his left side			1
when it intensified , his wife @entity96 , 52 , drove him to @entity98			0
he was then taken by ambulance to the @entity7 , where an emergency team waited			2
surgeons at the @entity7 injected stem cells , pictured , from mr @entity0 's hip into his heart in the hope that it would help the organ repair itself			1
the treatment appears to have worked and mr @entity0 's heart muscle function has improved from 21 per cent after the attack to 37 per cent and it is still improving ‘ i was petrified , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ i had an out - of - body experience , where i saw my dead son and my father looking at me , shaking their heads , as if to say it was n’t my time			2
’ the surgical team inserted a small tube called a stent into the narrowed coronary artery , which was causing the heart attack , to widen it and restore blood flow			1
a day later , @entity0 was visited in the intensive care unit by experts seeking the first patients for their heart stem - cell experiment , called the bone marrow acute myocardial infarction trial ( @entity129 )			1
@entity0 was among the first of 3,000 participants in a @entity133 - wide study			2
all are to be treated within five days of a heart attack in the hope of increasing survival rates			1
‘ i was only the second person in the @entity138 to have had it done , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ the morning after , they came and took bone marrow from my hip to obtain my stem cells			1
‘ it hurt for a second , despite the anaesthetic , but it was fine once the needle was in fully			0
’ the next day surgeons put a tube into a wrist artery and ran it into his heart			2
they injected a syringe of stem cells , then stopped the blood supply to his heart for a second , so the stem cells would be deposited there			1
‘ they did this seven times with seven syringes			0
i was awake all the time , and it was n’t traumatic , ’ says @entity0			0
within hours , he was up and about			0
now he feels entirely recovered			0
the @entity129 study aims to see if it is a result of the stem cell injections , or whether @entity0 may have recovered this way anyway			2
but @entity0 , who will be monitored for five years after the treatment , is convinced he ’s benefited			0
‘ i feel brilliant , ’ he says			0
@entity167 , director of cardiology at @entity169 and professor of cardiology at @entity172 , is the @entity129 chief trial co-ordinator			0
he says it will be four to five years before doctors know definitively whether adult stem cells from bone marrow can repair damaged hearts			1
elsewhere in @entity32 , surgeons are pioneering stem cell therapy for stroke patients			2
last month , the researchers from @entity183 reported that all five patients in the trial were alive and three were living independently at home six months later			0
four of the patients had the most serious type of stroke			0
mr @entity0 , pictured with his wife @entity96 and sons @entity35 and @entity36 , will be monitored as part of the study for five years normally , only one in 25 such patients is able to live independently after six months			1
each had stem cells extracted from their bone marrow			1
these can grow into blood cells and cells that line blood vessels			0
the stem cells were injected into an artery supplying blood to the brain			1
scans of patients ’ brains found that damage caused by the stroke had reduced over time , although similar improvements may also be seen in stroke patients as part of the normal recovery process			0
a handful of @entity138 patients have had stem cell treatment to restore sight to one eye that had been damaged or blinded by trauma			0
this is done using cells taken from their good eye			0
‘ we have performed this on 25 patients , and in all cases it has been successful , with patients experiencing a significant reduction in visual impairment , ’ says lead researcher @entity225 , professor of ophthalmology at the @entity227 in @entity228 and @entity229			0
meanwhile , surgeons at @entity239 are injecting stem cells and ‘ biological glue ’ into patients who have torn the cartilage in their hips and knees			1
it is hoped the stem cells can save joints from developing arthritis or needing to be replaced			1
@entity250 , senior lecturer in stem cell science at @entity252 , says : ‘ we are still in very early days			0
the best successes have been with very simple tissues , such as cartilage			0
‘ it will take five to ten years before we really understand what can be done in the future			0
i do n’t think we ’ll ever be able to use stem cells to regenerate all the organs and tissues of a human			2
’ nevertheless , lab studies on animals indicate there are still further possibilities for future stem cell therapies			0
for example , @entity269 investigators have taken skin cells from three infertile men and converted them into stem cells			2
when transplanted into the testes of mice , these cells developed into early - stage human sperm cells			0
the research shows it may be possible to restore male fertility by injecting cells into infertile men ’s testes			0
and , at the @entity283 , treatment with human stem cells has allowed mice crippled by a version of multiple sclerosis to walk again after less than two weeks			2
a similar outcome in humans could help patients in potentially disabling stages of the disease , says the study in the journal @entity296 .			0

father - of - two @entity0 , 55 , suffered a heart attack in february
surgeons at the @entity7 offered him a unique chance
experimental therapy involved injecting stem cells from mr @entity0 's hip into his heart in the hope they would encourage the organ to repair itself
it appears to have worked as mr @entity0 's heart muscle function has increased from 21 **%** after the attack to 37 **%** and it is still improving
experts hope the new technique will increase survival rates by a quarter
