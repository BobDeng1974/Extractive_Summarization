a new gcse supergrade is to be awarded to the brightest teenagers after the current elite a * grade was devalued by being awarded to too many students			1
it is expected just one in 35 students who show ‘ exceptional ’ performance will be awarded the top ‘ grade nine ’ in gcse - effectively an a * *			1
the change for gcse @entity10 and maths in 2017 - and other subjects from 2018 - is designed to help universities and employers spot the most gifted students			1
a new gcse supergrade is to be awarded to the brightest teenagers after the current elite a * grade was devalued by being awarded to too many students but it is also an indictment of the current system which has seen the proportion of a * grades creep up from 2.9 per cent when it was first introduced in 1994 to 7.8 per cent in 2011			1
the number of a * grades has since dipped to 6.7 per cent but fewer than 3 per cent of entrants are expected to get the new a * * style grade nine			1
the changes were outlined yesterday by exams watchdog @entity30 after former education secretary @entity31 ordered sweeping improvements to gcses beginning in 2015			1
under the new system , traditional alphabetic grades – a * to @entity36 – will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine , with nine being the highest			1
the top two grades on the current scale – a and a * - will be replaced with three in the new system – seven , eight and nine			2
just 20 per cent of pupils in line for at least an a under the current system will achieve the elite grade nine			2
in @entity10 , it could mean just 2.8 per cent of candidates gaining the top grade and in maths , 2.9 per cent			2
this is similar to the proportion who gained an a * when that grade was introduced in 1994 to identify higher and lower performers within the @entity58 band			1
in a further reform , grades will be benchmarked for the first time against top - performing countries such as @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity65 , head of @entity30 , said the so - called ’ 20 per cent rule ’ was the ‘ fairest ’ way to ‘ achieve that greater stretch and differentiation at the top end so many require ’			0
explaining the changes , mrs @entity65 said : ‘ similar numbers of students who got a * or a in the old qualifications will get either seven , eight or nine in the new qualifications			1
‘ that means we ’ve got three grades – seven , eight and nine – whereas we only have a and a * at the moment , so two grades will become three			2
the changes were outlined yesterday by exams watchdog @entity30 after former education secretary @entity31 ordered sweeping improvements to gcses beginning in 2015 ' you ’ll bear in mind there ’s been a strong call from users of @entity91 that there needs to be greater differentiation at the top end			1
’ it also emerged that the same proportion of students will achieve at least a grade four under the new system as receive at least a grade c currently			1
grade four is likely to be seen as a de facto ‘ pass ’ – as @entity103 is currently – but @entity30 said grade five was actually the standard of a pass in top - performing nations			2
officials said that grade five had been pegged to performance in countries and regions such as @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity64 and the @entity116			2
@entity30 also released the results of a consultation on the planned changes , which found that a majority supported toughening up the criteria for the top grade			2
several respondents said grade nine ‘ should test the most able and be restricted to a small number of exceptional candidates ’			2
one teacher said : ‘ grade 9 should be for exceptional results , otherwise it will go the same way that a * went after its introduction			1
how many are exceptional ? i ’ve no idea but based on an average school cohort sitting my subject ’s exam i would expect a grade 9 to be achieved by only 2 or 3 out of an entry of 60 +			0
’ however criticisms of the plan included the claim that state schools would suffer because independent schools would bring more pupils up to the standard required for the new grade			0
it would have a ‘ disproportionate effect on state schools ’ , it was claimed			0
the 20 per cent rule will apply to revamped gcses in @entity10 language , @entity10 literature and maths which schools will begin to teach in autumn 2015 , with the first exams taken in summer 2017			1
a similar approach is expected – but not guaranteed - for other gcse subjects , which are being phased in from 2016			0
changes to gcses already confirmed include an end to modular tests in most subjects , with traditional end - of - course exams becoming the ‘ default method of assessment ’			0
the move is aimed at stopping the @entity171 of pupils entering early or multiple times in the hope of eventually gaining a good grade			0
controversial ‘ controlled assessments ’ – coursework done in class – will be minimised amid concerns over teachers were able to massage results			0
the new - look @entity91 will also feature more demanding subject content and a better mix of closed and open - ended questions			0
in a further move , a sample of pupils each year – possibly several thousand – would sit an @entity10 and maths test just before their gcses to help examiners ensure that grading is accurate			0
if pupils do well in the tests , being introduced in 2017 , it may mean that higher grades are awarded in gcses			1
@entity30 would be able to claim grades had risen legitimately – rather than because of grade inflation - because candidates had achieved higher standards in their subjects			0
if pupils fail to improve on the previous year , @entity30 will use the results as justification for keeping grades down			0
head teachers ’ leaders were already voicing concerns last night over the plan to limit the proportion of pupils gaining the grade nine to 20 per cent of @entity58 performers			0
@entity214 , general secretary of the @entity215 , said : ‘ we do have concerns about limiting the proportion of students who can get the highest grade			1
if students achieve at a very high level that should be recognised			0
where standards have improved , the results must reflect this			0
