by @entity0 from their first public appearance together , when she walked out of the hospital cradling her newborn son , we 've barely seen the @entity6 and @entity7 separated			1
but today , for the first time , baby @entity7 was pictured not in the arms of doting mother @entity6 but in those of his new nanny , 43 - year - old @entity9 - and he looked less than impressed			1
the 8 - month - old prince pulled an adorably grumpy face as @entity9 carried him to the car upon the family 's arrival in @entity19 today			1
@entity36 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , who suffers from @entity40 , was given the honour of meeting the royal trio after her mother wrote to the palace , describing her ' admiration and affection ' for family			2
after his meet and greet , a weary and slightly grumpy looking @entity7 , who was dressed in a smart and summery white ensemble , was taken to the car by his nanny - perhaps he was feeling tired after the flight from @entity53			1
his parents then headed off to the @entity55 , where they met excited well - wishers , before the family reunited and met the governor - general sir @entity58 at @entity59 , where @entity7 looked delighted to be presented with a giant stuffed toy wombat			1
@entity6 and @entity61 travelled by boat , while little @entity7 took the car with miss @entity9			1
feeling sleepy ? miss @entity9 , who began work with the family a month ago , is responsible for keeping the eight - month - old charge fed , watered , rested and happy in mummy 's arms : a sleepy @entity7 snuggles up to mother @entity6 ( left ) as they leave the aircraft , before he was cared for by his nanny ( right ) while his parents visited the @entity55 smiles all around : @entity7 looks delighted as he receives a giant stuffed wombat gift from the governor - general sir @entity58 at @entity59 , where he was reunited with his parents later in the day well prepared : the @entity73 's training at the prestigious @entity74 , where fees cost nearly £ 13,000 per year , will have prepared her well for the job on his first day of the @entity78 , @entity7 was given a kangaroo backpack as a welcome present			1
and it appears the gift is a hit : today his nanny @entity9 was seen carrying the rucksack just after the royal trio touched down in @entity19			1
the @entity87 is one of the stockists of the bag that retails at $ 14.95 and sold out of its remaining stock the day it was given to the young prince			0
ceo @entity95 said there had been an huge rush on the cute kangaroo bag			0
' we sold the last ones that morning - we 've had to take them off the website but we 'll be ordering more			0
' with the bag stocked at numerous outlets , ms @entity95 said there was no way of knowing who gave it to the prince			0
she offered prince @entity61 an invitation to become the patron of the 28 - year old @entity112			1
the ceo also offered to extend the invitation to young @entity7			2
' he could be the patron in waiting			0
' this is n't the first time that the @entity117 's new nanny has been in sole charge of the baby boy			2
she looked after @entity7 last sunday when @entity6 and @entity61 went to @entity121 , and she will be in charge of the baby again on april 22 when they visit @entity125 , or @entity125			1
miss @entity9 , from @entity126 , 140 miles north of @entity127 , was first spotted descending the steps of the plane onto the runway at @entity53 last week , along with three long - standing assistants to the royal couple : @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
but the @entity73 's training at the prestigious @entity74 , where fees cost nearly £ 13,000 per year , will have prepared her well for the job			1
the internationally - renowned nanny school drew up a shortlist of suitable candidates after the @entity142 and @entity6 approached them looking for a nanny for @entity7 , from which the royal couple chose the low - key @entity73			1
they decided to hire a nanny after first relying on help from the @entity142 ' mother , @entity149 , and the @entity142 's former nanny , @entity150 , 71			2
miss @entity9 , who is thought to be the first foreign nanny chosen to look after a future @entity153 monarch , comes from a smart family of high achievers in @entity126 , 140 miles north of @entity127			2
when her parents , @entity158 and @entity9 , married in a glamorous @entity160 ceremony in @entity127 in 1967 , the wedding was reported in the society pages of @entity163 's royalist right - wing daily newspaper , @entity162			2
miss @entity9 was born in @entity127 , and is the only girl in a family of four children , with brothers named @entity168 , @entity158 and @entity169			2
