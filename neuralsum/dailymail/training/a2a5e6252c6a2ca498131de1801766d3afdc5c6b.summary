a completely new type of fundamental particle may explain the mystery of ' dark matter ' , the missing material that makes up more than 80 per cent of the universe 's mass , according to @entity8 scientists			1
researchers at the @entity10 believe the nature of their hypothetical particle may be the reason why no - one has yet managed to detect dark matter directly			1
dark matter reveals itself to astronomers in the way its gravity affects stars and galaxies , helping to bind them together and give the universe structure			2
it has a mass only about 0.02 per cent that of an electron - making it extremely ' light '			1
this would make it unable to pass through @entity36 's atmosphere - so @entity36 - based detectors would not be able to detect it its imprint can also be seen in the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , the ' afterglow ' of the @entity42			1
but despite extensive efforts the mysterious material has never been directly observed			0
the new research suggests one reason for this may be that dark matter particles are much lighter than has previously been proposed			2
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			0
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe			1
the hypothetical particle has a mass only about 0.02 per cent that of an electron			1
while it does not interact with light , it interacts surprisingly strongly with normal matter , and may not even be able to penetrate the @entity36 's atmosphere			1
if this is the case , dark matter particles are unlikely to be spotted by @entity36 - bound detectors			1
' this work brings together some very different areas of physics : theoretical particle physics , observational x-ray astronomy , and experimental quantum optics , ' said dr @entity93 , from the department of physics and astronomy at the @entity10			0
' our candidate particle sounds crazy , but currently there seem to be no experiments or observations which could rule it out			0
' dark matter is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern physics , and we hope that our suggestion will inspire others to develop detailed particle theory and even experimental tests			2
' the team , whose findings are published in the journal @entity115 , hope to incorporate a search for the new particle into a space experiment with which it is already involved			0
@entity120 ( @entity121 ) will aim to test quantum phenomena - the weird behaviour of subatomic particles - at larger scales			0
as part of the experiment , a nanoparticle suspended in space will be used to see if its position is altered by the flow of dark matter			2
the researchers plan to perform an experiment in space to find out if they can detect dark matter			2
@entity120 ( @entity121 ) will aim to test the weird behaviour of subatomic particles at a larger scale			0
a nanoparticle will be suspended in space to see if dark matter alters its position ( illustrated ) ' at the moment , experiments on dark matter do not point into a clear direction and , given that also the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) at @entity146 has not found any signs of new physics yet , it may be time that we shift our paradigm towards alternative candidates for dark matter , ' said co-author dr @entity154 , from the @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157			2
' more and more particle physicists seem to think this way , and our proposal seems to be a serious competitor on the market			0
' scientists believe dark matter makes up 26.8 per cent of the combined mass - energy of the universe			1
normal matter accounts for 4.9 per cent and the even more mysterious ' dark energy ' 26.8 per cent			0
in terms of mass alone , dark matter is thought to make up 84.5 per cent of the the universe .			1

university of @entity26 researchers have proposed a hypothetical fundamental particle for dark matter
it has a mass only about 0.02 per cent that of an electron - making it extremely ' light '
this would make it unable to pass through @entity36 's atmosphere
in turn , @entity36 - based detectors would therefore not be able to detect it
this could explain why dark matter has not yet been found
dark matter is thought to make up 84.5 per cent of the universe - but no *evidence* for it has yet been found
