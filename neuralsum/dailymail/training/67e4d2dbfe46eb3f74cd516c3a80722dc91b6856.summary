the ice served in six out of ten of @entity5 ’s most popular high street restaurants contains more bacteria than the water found in their toilets , an investigation by @entity1 has found			1
scientific tests have shown that ice from branches of @entity13 ’s , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 ’s all had higher levels of bacteria than samples of water taken from their lavatory bowls			1
experts say it could be due to them being cleaned more often than the ice machines			1
none of the samples found presented an immediate health danger , but four contained such high levels of microbes the restaurants should be considered a ‘ hygiene risk ’ , according to a government - accredited laboratory			1
' poor hygeine ' : @entity38 served in six out of ten of @entity5 's most popular high street restaurants contains more bacteria than the water found in their toilets			1
reporter @entity45 pictured in @entity46 , @entity47 , with samples from @entity14 the samples from @entity13 ’s , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity18 ’s all suggested ‘ poor hygiene ’ over their ice , the laboratory said			1
in the cases of @entity57 ’s and @entity14 , the levels of bacteria in ice were more than double than that which the scientists said they expect to see in drinking water			1
for the tests , staff were asked to provide a sample of ice in a sterile bag			0
a sample of water in the restaurant toilet was also taken by an accredited environmental health practitioner			0
the samples , obtained from branches of ten chains in @entity73 , @entity47 , were then couriered in a fridge to @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , for testing			2
@entity79 's more bacteria in ice than toilets			1
tests on ice water at @entity84 : 2,100 organisms			0
toilet water : 1,300 organisms			0
@entity14 more bacteria in ice than toilets			1
ice bacteria at @entity92 : 260 organisms			2

ice bacteria at @entity84 : 1,400 organisms			2
toilet water at @entity92 : 260 organisms			0
@entity15 more bacteria in ice than toilets			1
tests on ice water at @entity84 : 1,100 organisms			0
toilet water : less than 1			0
cafe rouge more bacteria in ice than toilets , but not above laboratory ’s hygiene guidelines			1
toilet water : less than 1			0
starbucks more bacteria in ice than toilets but within laboratory hygiene guidelines			1
@entity120 in ice at @entity84 : 430 organisms			0
toilet water exceeded drinking water standards			0
toilet water : 3,200 organisms at @entity84 , highest in study			0
toilet water : within bacteria count guidelines			2
@entity38 bacteria at both temperatures less than 10 organisms			0
toilet water at @entity92 : 160 @entity139 per ml experts said the samples from @entity13 ’s , @entity15 , and @entity18 ’s showed that contamination was likely to have been caused by ‘ environmental issues ’ , such as a dirty ice machine			1
the @entity14 result suggested the cause was human contamination , likely to be from a staff member failing to wash their hands			2
the results have prompted some of the chains to review their cleaning procedures , although two companies disputed the findings			0
dr @entity157 , a former laboratory director for the @entity158 , said the results show restaurants need to ensure staff are properly trained to handle ice			0
‘ this is a warning , ’ she said			0
‘ it is easy to forget ice can carry bacteria because they think it is too cold for germs , but that is far from the truth			2
nasty bugs such as @entity172 can lurk in ice machines			1
in some cases , such as @entity18 ’s , we found double the amount of bacteria we would expect to find [ in drinking water ]			0
this is caused by things such as a failure to clean machines and scoops used by staff			0
’ the samples were tested for pathogens and their total bacteria counts at @entity84 and @entity92			1
higher counts at @entity92 are often associated with contamination by human or animal contact , such as meat in the kitchen			0
raised @entity84 counts are usually due to environmental organisms and can indicate a failure to clean ice machines			1
at @entity84 , @entity57 ’s had the highest bacterial levels			0
the laboratory ’s guidelines recommend no more than 1,000 organisms per ml of liquid			0
@entity18 ’s had 2,100 , @entity13 ’s 1,400 , and @entity15 1,100			1
at @entity92 , guidelines state that levels exceeding 100 organisms per ml show evidence of poor hygiene			2
@entity14 was the only one to surpass the limit , with 260 organisms			2
scientists say there is a satisfactory level of bacteria that can be higher than that found in toilet water			1
the ice quality at @entity16 and @entity17 fell into this category			1
a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ we are working with the franchisee to investigate the situation			2
’ a spokesperson for the franchisee that operates the @entity15 said : ‘ we have retrained staff on procedures as a precaution			2
’ at @entity17 a spokesman said : ‘ we take such issues very seriously and have immediately taken actions to review the ice - making process at this restaurant			1
’ tested : ice from branches of @entity13 's , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 's all had higher levels of bacteria than samples of water taken from their lavatory bowls and a @entity13 ’s spokesman said : ‘ the ice tested contained low levels of common bacteria considered acceptable and safe for consumption			1
’ @entity16 said the ice sample had inadvertently been contaminated by staff when they opened the sterile bag			2
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity247 footage confirms that it was contaminated before it was tested			0
’ a @entity18 ’s spokesman said : ‘ we challenge these results and do not accept that they demonstrate any failings			0

@entity13 's , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity254 tested
ice from branches had higher levels of bacteria in ice than toilet samples
experts say it could be down to toilets cleaned more often than ice machines
four samples contained enough microbes to be ' hygiene risk '
