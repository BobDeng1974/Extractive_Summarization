by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 13:27 est , 13 february 2013 @entity1 was today forced to make a grovelling on - air apology after pictures showing the pregnant @entity5 in her bikini were shown to millions of this morning viewers			1
the photographs , labelled ' violating ' by the @entity9 , were taken as @entity5 strolled along a beach with prince @entity11 on the exclusive private @entity13 island of @entity14			1
@entity16 gossip magazine @entity15 and @entity18 weekly @entity17 have published them , but the @entity21 media has refused because they breach the royal couple 's privacy			1
but today this morning presenters @entity1 and @entity25 were discussing the story in a news review section when @entity15 's front cover flashed up and filled the screen , but the pictures were not blacked - out			1
@entity1 was later forced to offer a humbling ' unreserved apology to the @entity32 and @entity5 ' for the ' deeply regrettable ' error on the show			1
' unfortunately we accidentally showed an unblurred image of the magazine cover , which briefly showed the photographs			2
this was a deeply regrettable error and we are very sorry			1
' we apologise unreservedly to the @entity32 and the @entity5			1
' it appears the hosts were unaware of the production error and continued to discuss the story with @entity74 sketch writer @entity73			1
apology : @entity1 returned to screen to say @entity38 ' apologises unreservedly to the @entity32 and @entity5 ' for the error it comes just three months after @entity78 and @entity79 agreed to pay @entity81 peer @entity82 £ 125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to @entity87 which contained his name			1
@entity78 attempted to bring this to the prime minister 's attention live on this morning in november but inadvertently allowed the list of names to be seen by viewers			2
it led to a grovelling apology from @entity79 and @entity78 and a giant settlement with @entity82 's legal team			2
@entity49 understands publishers in the @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 have also bought the set of @entity5 pictures for more than £ 100,000 in total			1
@entity16 gossip magazine @entity15 , which caused outrage when it published a photograph of princess @entity108 as she lay dying , splashed pictures of the duchess and her growing baby bump across its front page			1
speaking about the publication on this morning , mail political sketch writer @entity73 said : ' the magazine is called @entity15 , perhaps it should be called cheap , and it is owned by the old groper himself , @entity115 , the @entity116 man			2
' there are people saying this is an invasion of privacy			0
i think they may be right			0
' ' @entity123 camera angle ' : the extraordinary moment @entity78 handed the list of names to @entity87 which prompted a huge financial settlement @entity5 , who is about four months pregnant , is wearing a bright blue halter - neck bikini with her slightly rounded stomach clearly visible			2
her arm is draped over her husband ’s shoulders while @entity11 , who is wearing blue baggy shorts and sunglasses , has an arm protectively around his wife ’s back			0
the headline on the front of @entity15 , which goes on sale today , reads ‘ @entity5 and @entity11 – honeymoon for three ’			2
the magazine also has pictures of @entity5 's sister @entity144 , who is seen walking hand - in - hand with a mystery man			1
the @entity32 's sibling is in a striped pink and black bikini and her slim companion is topless , wearing dark swimming shorts emblazoned with multi-coloured stars			1
in another shot the couple are seen walking along on the famous @entity14 white sands with @entity144 's brother @entity155 , who is also on the island along with parents @entity157 and @entity159			2
holiday : @entity5 is on @entity14 with her sister @entity144 , their brother @entity155 and parents @entity159 and @entity157 new man : @entity144 , here at @entity166 with former boyfriend @entity167 in 2011 , has been pictured walking on the beach holding hands with a new man in @entity15 magazine @entity173 , editor of @entity172 , has defended his decision to print the images			1
he told the @entity176 : ' the photographs , which can in no way be considered scandalous , were bought from an international photo agency , do not harm the image of the protagonists and the reaction of the media seems to me wholly over the top			2
' moreover , the photographs can hardly be considered an invasion of privacy when the subjects are public figures in a public place , in the open air ; specifically on a beach surrounded by other bathers			0
' he told @entity16 news website @entity196 : ' you ca n't compare it with the media persecution of @entity200 ( @entity108 , @entity201 )			2
i repeat : the photos were taken in a public place			0
' @entity17 editor @entity205 said she had no qualms about running the pictures , insisting they were taken by a fellow tourist on @entity14 – and not a paparazzo			2
she said the royal couple are not a ‘ protected species ’ outside @entity21			0
' this is not a hard decision			0
@entity5 's on a public beach , there are other holiday - makers there and she looks fabulous , ' she said , adding : ' @entity218 , we see this every day			1
we see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive here '			0
the royal couple are two of the world 's most recognisable people but it can be a struggle to guard their privacy , which is why they headed for the private island of @entity14 last night , royal sources said @entity11 , in particular , still felt ‘ very bruised ’ about the fresh breach of privacy so soon after the same magazine splashed topless photographs of @entity5 across its front page beneath the headline ‘ the queen is naked ’			1
the source said @entity11 felt very strongly at the time that he had somehow ‘ failed ’ to protect his wife			0
the intimate photographs are thought to have been taken from a boat using a long lens camera			0
chi magazine , which is owned by former @entity16 prime minister @entity115 , boasts : ‘ the extraordinary images of the @entity32 and @entity5 on their dream holiday in the @entity13			1
‘ the future mum , now four months pregnant , wore a tiny bikini which showed off her visible bump			0
’ tweets : the mistake today prompted people to go on @entity259 to express their disbelief at what happened @entity18 magazine @entity17 has also printed the pictures , as well as photographs of @entity5 's sister @entity144 in a bikini , claiming they were taken by a member of the public on a public beach			1
editor @entity205 said the royal couple are not a ‘ protected species ’ outside @entity21 adding : ' this is not a hard decision			0
@entity5 's on a public beach , there are other holiday - makers there and she looks fabulous			1
' however , @entity14 is a private island and there is an expectation of privacy for anyone holidaying there because the paparazzi is banned			0
mrs @entity205 said : ' as @entity218 , we see this every day			0
we see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive here			0
' our readers are going to love these photos			0
i do n't expect any backlash at all really			0
i think she 's looking fabulous and healthy and ( with ) a beautiful bump , like we have n't seen her before			0
' @entity297 getaway : the couple are staying at a £ 5million , five - bedroom mansion , one of the most opulent on the island safe haven : @entity14 is well - known amongst celebs as a place to go to avoid media intrusion members of the @entity5 family have accompanied the couple on their holiday			1
( @entity310 ) @entity157 , @entity155 , @entity159 and @entity144 it is not the first time an @entity18 magazine has published photos of royals against the wishes of the royal family			1
@entity319 storm : @entity18 magazine @entity17 has produced this poster advertising their next edition out on monday one of the most controversial decisions was made by @entity324 magazine - engaged in a bitter publication war with @entity17 - which revealed in 2008 that prince @entity326 had been posted to @entity327 , putting the royal at risk			1
yesterday a spokesman for @entity331 said : ‘ we are disappointed that photographs of the @entity32 and @entity5 on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas			1
‘ this is a clear breach of the couple ’s right to privacy			0
’ today the @entity331 would not comment further or speculate about whether they would launch any kind of legal action			0
a palace source said : ‘ it ’s violating ’			0
the duke and duchess , who are expecting their first child in july , flew to a £ 19,000 - a - week luxury villa on the island of @entity14 last week			0
@entity5 ’s parents , @entity159 and @entity350 , and her sister @entity144 , flew out at the same time and are renting a villa nearby			1

@entity14 , a private island with just 74 villas and one small hotel , is where princess @entity358 once had a holiday home and is frequented by stars including @entity362			0
@entity5 and @entity11 , who were accompanied by a team of bodyguards , have chosen the island for seven of their last eight holidays because of the privacy it affords them			2
@entity14 is patrolled both on - shore and off - shore by the island ’s private security team , but they failed to spot the paparazzi waiting for the couple to emerge on the beach .			0
