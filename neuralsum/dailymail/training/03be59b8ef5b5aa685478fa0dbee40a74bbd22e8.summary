by @entity0 @entity1 battle : cruciferous vegetables in addition to exercise can help you slim i am a fit 65 - year - old female			1
i am 5ft 6in and weigh around 7.5st			1
i play golf at least twice a week in the winter and in the summer i can play up to five times a week			1
i walk six miles with a friend once a week and average 3.8 miles per hour			1
my problem is that as i have got older my stomach / waist has definitely increased and i would love to slim down			1
obviously i have no need to diet but as i have problems with my neck , shoulder and elbows i need to take care when it comes to doing exercise			1
is there anything you can recommend that i can do at home ? the thought of going to a gym just does not appeal			1
it sounds like your active lifestyle is keeping you in great shape , although based on your height and weight your @entity34 of 17.5 shows you ’re actually slightly underweight ( anything between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal )			1
if you ’ve always been naturally slim , how frustrating it must be that you ’ve now gained weight around your middle for no apparent reason			1
but the dreaded middle - aged spread is a problem for many women @entity44 has been attributed to changes in hormone levels as we age			1
progesterone levels in women decrease far faster than oestrogen levels during the menopausal years , leading to what some doctors claim is ‘ oestrogen dominance ’ in the body , which can then be compounded by high oestrogen levels in our food and water			1
as oestrogen acts like a ‘ fat magnet ’ , high levels of the hormone are associated with weight gain around the middle – so one key to combating this is diet			1
you have no need to diet for weight loss , but what you eat is as important as portion size and those who believe in this theory recommend avoiding ‘ oestrogenstimulating foods ’ and upping the intake of foods that shift excess oestrogen out of your system			1
this means eating more ‘ cruciferous ’ vegetables like broccoli , cabbage and kale ( you can find a list online ) and citrus fruits , as well as insoluble fibre			1
no crucifixion : cruciferous vegetables include broccoli , types of cabbage and kale this is found in whole grains , carrots , flax and other seeds			2
it binds itself to excess oestrogen in the digestive tract and carries it out			2
muscle mass also decreases as we age , which can slow the rate at which we burn calories ( meaning you ’ll gain weight even if you eat the same amount )			2
to combat this , try adding some musclestrengthening exercises to your daily routine – which can easily be done at home using some @entity119 bands , a set of hand weights or even a @entity123 machine – a suspension system			2
@entity119 is a brilliant exercise for strengthening and slimming the core			2
a few private sessions at home will be more effective in targeting your specific problems			2
i have developed a medical condition as a result of which i suffer from very tender and painful hands and wrists			2
can you recommend general exercises that do not involve me having to lean on my hands ? i do not swim and already walk as an exercise			0
there are many ways to stay fit without using your hands			0
you ’re already a walker but have you thought about running ? it ’s one of the easiest ways to work out , as the only equipment you need is a good pair of running shoes			0
i ’m also a big fan of high intensity interval training ( @entity150 ) , where you perform one exercise for 20 - 30 seconds and rest for 10 , for a cycle of eight rounds			0
download an app like @entity155 , which has all sorts of mini workout videos to try at home			0
surfer dude : @entity160 has designed his own line of board designer @entity160 has created a line of surfboards for his new @entity166 collection – which does n’t surprise me at all , as surfing has never been more fashionable			0
in @entity171 , @entity169 and members club @entity168 both offer lessons at the city ’s @entity173 , while @entity175 surfing , as popularised by celebrities such as @entity177 , is a fast - growing water sport			1
is @entity160 a surfer himself ? i do n’t think so , but for such a dedicated party boy he is fit			0
he works out at least three times a week , and ran the @entity182 in under three and a half hours			0
cardiologist dr @entity184 argues it ’s possible to be overweight and still be healthy			0
he says overweight patients may live longer than those of ‘ normal ’ weight , because they have more energy reserves to fight illness			0
but is n’t obesity likely to result in heart disease and diabetes ? healthy bodies do come in all sizes , but issues that lead to poor food choices and weight gain must be addressed			0
so @entity199 plans a new ‘ lower - sugar ’ drink called @entity201			0
the new product contains a third less sugar – but still more than four teaspoons in each can			0
for a healthy drink to really hydrate you , try fizzy water with a squeeze of lemon or lime and a tiny pinch of salt			0
