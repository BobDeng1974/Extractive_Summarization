@entity0 has been accused of photoshopping a recent @entity2 post , which featured her posing in a bikini while on holiday in @entity7			1
the selfie , which was posted on @entity9 , shows the 19 - year - old standing in front of a mirror in her hotel room , presumably as she was getting ready to head out to the pool or beach			1
but while many of @entity0 's 17 million followers rushed to praise her trim and toned physique , others pointed out some suspicious - looking wavy lines in the bottom left corner of the picture , suggesting that they are signs the image has been edited			1
and her waist looks weird too			2
' celebrity blogger @entity39 was also quick to point out the seemingly edited aspects of the picture , commenting : ' maybe it 's just the angle , but if you look along the very bottom of the picture , you 'll see what looks like warping			1
' even the frame of the window seems to be bent inward a little â€” and @entity59 is going on with @entity0 's wrist ? ' if it is @entity63 , all we can ask is : why alter a perfectly flawless bod ? ' one reader added : ' do n't know much about @entity63 but think the picture is doctored , because her arm is so skinny she looks like she has rickets or something			0
' but @entity71 's picture director was slightly more skeptical about the photoshop claims , saying : ' if she were to have photoshopped anything it would not be that section of the frame that would be warped			0
' i see that slight warping referred to on the window sill , but would n't she alter an area that was either on the other side or higher up and not near her wrist for a better effect ? i think it is just the angle of the photo myself and that she looks amazing			0
' trim and toned : @entity0 frequently flaunts her enviable figure in a series of crop tops , be it on the catwalk ( @entity95 ) or at home ( r ) @entity0 , who celebrated the start of the @entity98 with a luxury getaway in @entity7 alongside close friends @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , is certainly not shy about showing off her impressive figure			1
the @entity107 model frequently flaunts her toned tummy and enviable waistline on social media and is frequently seen out and about in a number of midriff - baring ensembles			1
but this is the first time that the rising fashion star has been accused of altering an image in order to make herself appear skinnier , and many fans are bemused as to why she thinks any editing would ever be necessary			2
' @entity0 you are so beautiful never change anything about yourself , ' one fan commented on the @entity2 snap			2
' this photo is everything , @entity0 you are perfect , ' another added			0
it is not the first time that a celebrity has been accused of altering their social media images ; in april last year , singer @entity133 came under fire from fans after posting a picture of herself playing golf , which they suggested had been edited in order to emphasize her ' thigh gap '			2
controversy : @entity0 's close friend @entity101 has also faced heavy criticism from fans after she posted this picture of herself flashing her ankles in a mosque			2
the image has since been removed from @entity2 wanderlust : @entity0 has been enjoying a luxury @entity98 's getaway in @entity7 alongside close friend and fellow model @entity102 at the time , one fan wrote on @entity152 : ' really @ @entity133 ? we all love your thick thighs			1
no reason to photoshop a thigh gap in there			0
. ' and @entity0 is not the only one of her friends to have posted a controversial snap during their @entity7 holiday			1
yesterday , singer @entity101 removed a picture of herself flashing her ankles at @entity167 's @entity166 from her @entity2 account after fans accused her of being ' insensitive ' and ' disrespectful ' of the country 's strict dress code			0
commenting on the picture , @entity2 user @entity172 said : ' disrecpectful ! it 's a religion place not a place to have fun in , so disappointed			0
' meanwhile another user , @entity177 , said : ' if their intent was to learn about @entity180 they would n't be posing like they were standing outside and amusement park			0
' i like @entity101 but to have her do something like this makes me no longer a fan			0

the 19 - year - old model posted the *sultry* snap on @entity9 , after celebrating the start of 2015 at a party in @entity7
*shortly* after the image was *shared* , celebrity blogger @entity39 pointed out the suspicious - looking wavy lines , which could indicate editing
