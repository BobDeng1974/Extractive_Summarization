staff at the command centres - collectively called the @entity47 - handle 999 calls and 101 calls from the public , taking around 4.5million calls each year			0
given the huge volume of calls , supervisors at the @entity47 are cracking down on time staff and officers spend away from their desks			2

one worker , who asked not to be named , said : ' of course some workers take the @entity68 and go to the loo for ages and come back with funny stories about what pals are up to on social media			0
' they are the exception rather than the rule and they are behind this ridiculous monitoring that is going on now			0

' he also said that officers at @entity47 found it ' extremely difficult ' to take holidays and were getting ' completely exhausted '			0
he added : ' officers have said that at times it is virtually impossible to go on leave or have any time off , which can lead to people getting completely exhausted			0
' a spokesman for @entity112 confirmed that ' time off the operation floor was monitored ' , but said it was ' unaware ' of supervisors following workers to the toilet			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity11 's @entity119 said it was looking at boosting morale at the @entity47 , saying it was organising a ' @entity123 ' and ' cake - bake ' to raise spirits			0
she added : ' control rooms are an unusual policing environment , as the operating procedures of call centres need to be run in conjunction with emergency response			0
' chief superintendent @entity132 , who took over the @entity133 ( @entity134 ) in march this year , said : ' we have done lots of consultation with officers and staff to identify those issues which would improve morale and working conditions			0
' as @entity134 commander of such a large and diverse team , i value the close but " critical friend " relationship i have with the @entity42			0
' government guidelines say workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day , if they work more than 6 hours a day			0
a spokesman from @entity12 - based employment law experts @entity154 said although there were ' no specific rules ' to say how long people could spend on toilet breaks , employers were obliged to allow people with medical conditions to have adequate time away from their desks			1
