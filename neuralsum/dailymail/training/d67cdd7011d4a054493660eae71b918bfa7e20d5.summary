a former @entity1 pastor who has lived a year without religion has revealed that he no longer believes @entity3 exists			1
@entity4 , 43 , made headlines in january when just days into his ' intellectual experiment ' to explore atheism he was fired from his two teaching jobs at @entity10 schools near @entity11			1
@entity4 was left struggling to support his two young daughters , aged 10 and 13 , until an atheist blogger set up an online fundraising site and helped raise over $ 27,000 to help him support his family			2
but after 12 months he has admitted that ' looking at the majority of arguments ... i do n't find there to be a convincing case in my view			1
' despite his change in views , @entity4 insists he is still the same person ' deep down ' and thinks atheism is an ' awkward fit '			1
talking to @entity36 he said the main lesson he took away from his experiment was ' that people very much value certainty and knowing and are uncomfortable saying that they do n't know			0
he added : ' i think before i wanted a closer relationship to @entity3 and today i just want a closer relationship with reality			0
' for 19 years @entity4 had been a pastor , most recently the senior pastor at the @entity47 seventh - day @entity45			2
then in march 2013 he resigned his position due to differences over his liberal views - including campaigning against the same - sex marriage ban for gay and lesbians - that did n't go down well with the church			0
with his 17 - year marriage also headed for divorce , @entity4 suffered a crisis of faith and in january 2014 , he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the @entity64 he decided to write a blog about that experiences called @entity69 former pastor 's @entity67			1
' for the next 12 months i will live as if there is no @entity3 , ' he wrote in his first entry			1
' i will not pray , read the @entity73 for inspiration , refer to @entity3 as the cause of things or hope that @entity3 might intervene and change my own or someone else 's circumstances			2
( i trust that if there really is a @entity3 that @entity3 will not be too flummoxed by my foolish experiment and allow others to suffer as a result )			0
' with his 17 - year marriage also headed for divorce , @entity4 suffered a crisis of faith and in january 2014 , he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the @entity64 the past 12 months has proved many testing times for @entity4 , but he tells the @entity91 that his also life has started to feel good again			1
@entity4 got a job teaching life skills at @entity95 , a nonprofit helping the homeless , and has also started dating again			1

' i do think i 've now seen both sides of the coin , ' he told the @entity91			0
' being with the atheists , they can have the same sort of obnoxious certainty that some @entity10 have , and i do n't want to be a part of that			0
it feels like i 'm stuck in the middle			0
' i want to be for something good , but i do n't want boundaries , and religion just feels like a very bounded thing			0
' the question i am asking right now : why do i need religion to love ? ' big decision : on january 1 and with his journey over @entity4 is expected to make a formal announcement on his blog about if he is to remain an atheist or return to @entity3			1
