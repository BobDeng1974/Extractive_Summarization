scientists believe it may be possible to clone a woolly mammoth within five years after finding well - preserved bone marrow in a thigh bone recovered from permafrost soil in @entity6			1
teams from @entity12 's @entity11 's mammoth museum and @entity8 's @entity13 will launch fully - fledged joint research next year aiming to recreate the giant mammal , @entity8 's @entity7 reported from @entity16 , @entity12			0
by replacing the nuclei of egg cells from an elephant with those taken from the mammoth 's marrow cells , embryos with mammoth dna can be produced , @entity7 said , citing the researchers			1
clone hope : the discovery of marrow inside the thigh bone of a woolly mammoth in @entity6 has led scientists to believe they can bring the species back to life exciting : mammoth bones like this one have been dug up many times before , but finding one with undamaged genes has proven a challenge ( file picture ) the scientists will then plant the embryos into elephant wombs for delivery as the two species are close relatives , the report said			1
securing nuclei with an undamaged gene is essential for the nucleus transplantation technique , it said			2
for scientists involved in the research since the late 1990s , finding nuclei with undamaged mammoth genes has been a challenge			0
fertile land : the thigh bone was discovered in the permafrost soil of @entity6 as were these tusks which came from an entire 23,000 - year - old mammoth dug up in 1999 mammoths became extinct about 10,000 years ago			2
but the discovery in august in @entity6 has increased the chances of a successful cloning			0
global warming has thawed ground in eastern @entity12 that is usually almost permanently frozen , leading to the discoveries of a number of frozen mammoths , the report said .			0

thigh bone discovered in permafrost soil of @entity6
contains *elusive* undamaged genes essential for nucleus transplantation
nuclei of elephant 's egg cells will be replaced with mammoth 's marrow dna
embryo will then be planted into elephant womb for *gestation*
