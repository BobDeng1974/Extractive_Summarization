former @entity1 batsman @entity0 has not ruled out playing county cricket again next season			1
@entity0 who has been contracted to @entity4 since 2010 , although he only played in the @entity6 competition last summer			1
the @entity8 - born batsman said he would make a decision about his playing future over the next couple of months but insisted he had been in contact with @entity4 , where his mentor @entity13 is head coach			1
video : scroll down to see @entity0 speak about bullying in the @entity1 camp @entity0 in action for @entity4 during the @entity6 semi-final against @entity18 ' i am definitely going to give it some thought over the next couple of months as to how i need to finish off my career because i look at the situation and think they are not going to pick me for the ashes next year , ' @entity0 said			1
' i do n't want to make quick decisions and i want to give it some time , give it some thought			0
' i am in contact with @entity4 because i love @entity4 and @entity13 , my mentor , is the coach there			1
i get on so well with @entity32 and the lads in the dressing room there			0
' so if i decide that i want to continue playing and basically play for the next four or five years then , yes , it is something i am basically going to make happen in the next couple of months			2
' former @entity1 head coach @entity37 ( right ) was singled out for criticism in @entity0 's book since arriving in the @entity40 from @entity41 as a teenager , @entity0 has played county cricket for @entity44 , @entity45 and now @entity4 and amassed 104 test appearances for @entity1			1
@entity0 was speaking during a q&a event at the @entity48 with @entity50 journalist @entity49 , who ghost wrote his controversial autobiography published last week			1
in the book @entity0 made several allegations , including claims of a bullying culture in the @entity1 dressing room			1
former head coach @entity37 and wicketkeeper @entity58 were particuarly singled out for criticism			1
following @entity1 's disastrous 5 - 0 whitewashing in the @entity25 last winter in @entity61 , @entity37 stood down and @entity0 was told his @entity63 career was over			1
@entity0 insisted that he would love to bat for @entity1 again and ' would do anything to go and play '			1
@entity66 ( right ) fears @entity0 's book will hurt @entity1 in the long run ' i would 100 % commit everything i could to bat			1
i would do anything to go and play , ' @entity0 said			1
' the frustrating thing about this last summer is that @entity1 have now got a team where that bullying side looks like it has faded away and there are a lot of youngsters in that side that i got on really well with , who i helped out with their cricket			1
' the sad thing is that i can be lying on the sofa the night before an international game and i can get a text message from players in the team asking me advice on how to play the opposition the next day			0
' that makes me happy that they are asking me on how to play the next day when they should probably be going to their coach and also with sadness because i should still be in that team helping these guys bat and helping in team meetings and playing in games because that 's where we could all benefit			1
' @entity0 also said that he would not have any problems playing under new head coach @entity103 - who he likens in his book to a ' woodpecker tapping on our heads all day ' during his first spell as @entity1 boss			1
@entity0 , in action for during the fourth @entity63 in @entity111 last year , has spoken of his demons ' when i did have my issues with @entity114 they were as a captain , ' @entity0 told the @entity117 audience			1
' i said to the chairman of the @entity119 , i can not captain with @entity103 , let me go back and bat			1
so i could easily go and bat , batting would not be an issue			0
' but he felt it was unlikely that he would ever be recalled by @entity1 while @entity126 remained chairman of the @entity119 ( @entity119 )			2
' i said it before that i think the chairman might have to make way , ' @entity0 said			2
' whether that happens i do n't know			0
if it happens , it happens and said earlier that what will be , will be			0
who knows what tomorrow brings ? ' they might wake up tomorrow and decide enough 's enough and this pr battle that is going on at the moment is not good for @entity141 cricket , i am certainly not proud of this pr battle but i 've had to tell my side of the story			0
' one member of the audience asked @entity0 why @entity1 were such a successful team in recent years if @entity37 was such a bad coach			1
' we had some very , very good players who were at the peak of their careers and no matter who coached them we would have been successful , ' the @entity8 replied			2
@entity0 agreed with the comments last week of former @entity1 captain @entity66 , who said the biggest loser in the wake of the publication of his book was the @entity1 team			1
' i do agree with that and i do n't like it and as i said i am not proud of it but what i am incredibly proud of is having the opportunity and the ability to sit down with @entity49 over the last few months and get my side of the story out , ' @entity0 said			2
' i 've had too many times where my character has been assassinated with @entity37 being able to drive it one way , hammer me about injuries , nail me about this , go over me about that , and so i have just had my opportunity to come out and put my side of the story out and just leave it			0
' it 's a sad state where @entity141 cricket is but it does n't have to be there now , it should have been sorted with a decent coach			2
' for nearly an hour - and - a - half @entity0 spoke about some of the demons that affected his playing career , such as knowing when he walked out to the crease whether he would get a good score or not			1
' in the recent @entity25 series we played in @entity61 i walked out to the wicket at @entity189 and i got out for nine			2
i walked down the wicket and hit @entity190 straight to mid-wicket and @entity192 caught me , ' he said			0
' i knew how i had got out and i knew i was lucky to get nine			0
but i got crucified - selfish , reckless , careless , why did you play the shot , why did you do this			2
' i 'm a ' feel ' player and i 'll know as soon as i get out to the wicket and touch my bat on the ground i know whether i am going to have a good day or a bad day			0
' it 's just the most ridiculous thing - the hours i put into training			2
i can walk out to the wicket and i can stand there and go ' oh shit ' - or walk out and think ' good luck you lot '			2
' there are certainly those days that i feel horrendous			0
' it has probably been my biggest struggle and i remember working a lot with the psychologists			0
if i walk out there and i am not feeling good how can i still get to 10 ? ' because getting to 10 for me was everything because as soon as i got to double figures i knew i was home and away			0
until i got there i knew it was only me who would get myself out			0
' good coaches and captains would understand , @entity221 and @entity222 did			0
' that day in @entity189 when i hit @entity190 to mid-wicket why the hell was i trying to do that ? it just does n't make sense			0
' @entity0 said he was already planning for future after his career ends			1
' i have been quite clever when i have been playing to set up quite a few businesses			2
the most exciting thing i have going at the moment is my cricket school in @entity234 , which opens next month , ' he said			0
' my foundation is going to run alongside that			0
i love coaching kids and i love giving advice , encouraging ... i love seeing people do well			0
i love coaching and i love giving back and i 've set up this cricket school purely for that			0
' if i get one or two of those guys that come through my academy end up being international players it would make me so proud			0
