the pace of change along central @entity3 ’s coastline is dizzying			1
as we drive along the beach road between the @entity8 of @entity9 and @entity10 , rows of luxury holiday resorts are being built on any spare piece of land overlooking the white beaches			1
‘ five years ago there was nothing here – this road we ’re driving on was n’t even built , ’ our guide @entity15 tells us			0
‘ local fisherman used to live in huts along here			0
now this area is turning into @entity3 ’s new playground			1
’ just beautiful : the @entity27 peninsula is one of the @entity30 sites where new resorts have appeared it is hard to tell from the tone of @entity15 ’s voice whether he welcomes the construction boom because of the jobs that are being created – or whether he is alarmed at the upheaval			0
while the arrival of mass tourism is certainly altering the landscape in central @entity3 , things have a long way to go before they reach the scale seen in large swathes of @entity47 over the past 20 years			1
and although the big - name brands have arrived , alongside manicured golf courses designed by @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 – it also , we soon discover , takes only a five - minute cycle ride to reach traditional villages where virtually no @entity57 is spoken , and the main occupation remains rice growing in the paddy fields			1
among the new resorts is a @entity61 – which , along with its sister hotel @entity62 next door , is situated beneath the @entity66 mountain range			0
a place of history : @entity10 was the capital of @entity3 's @entity71 dynasty , and wears its heritage in bright colours this is currently the only resort on a crescent - shaped bay near @entity27 , a remote area of fishing villages and jungle , midway down the central coast			1
there are plans to add another six hotels and a casino to the area , but when we arrive there is little other evidence of new development			1
as we approach the resort , we can see emerald - green paddy fields spreading out for miles , flecked by conical bamboo hats shielding farmers from the midday sun. we see very little of the resort until we were right upon it			1
it has been nestled into the shadows of the mountains , keeping it from dominating the skyline			0
it is a resort of villas , its sloped pagoda - style roofs modelled on the traditional houses of the old imperial city of @entity10 , with plunge pools and infinity pools slotted in			1
during our visit , we suffer several days of unusually cold and wet weather , so our trips to the beach are limited			0
fortunately , there are plenty of non-beach related activities with which to fill our time			0
a stretch of sand to soothe the soul : @entity27 is one of the @entity122 's most idyllic spots we opt to take the hotel bikes to the centre of @entity27 , some 13 miles away			0
our plans bemuse the hotel staff , who say guests tend to use them to get around the resort , rather than for any longer excursions			0
within a couple of minutes we realise why			0
those imposing granite mountains prove something of a challenge for our one - gear bikes to get over			1
but after a lot of panting and inevitable pushing , we find ourselves cycling through quaint hamlets where homes have small grocery shops spilling out of their front drives			0
some front rooms and gardens have been converted into noodle stalls , with plastic chairs and tables neatly set with chopstick holders and small plates of thick - cut limes , fresh chilli and garlic			2
as we cycle past , a growing gathering of @entity30 children run – or in some cases cycle – after us with big grins on their faces			0
over and over again they shout : ‘ hello , how are you ? ’ shadows fall : the @entity163 rear up above the central coast of @entity3 we are hoping to buy wine in @entity27 , somewhat afraid of the mini-bar prices			1
but all we can find are cans of beer or bottles of the local firewater ruou – a sticky distilled - rice liquor			2
declining the chance to sample this home - brew at leisure , we come upon two floating restaurants on a nearby lake			1
this proves to be a thoroughly authentic experience – the seafood in our noodle dishes sourced from two attached fish farms			0
at 50p a head , our meal is certainly value for money			0
back at our hotel , we were glad of some luxury after our long ride			2
we both opt for a @entity190 massage , and the aches fade away			0
the resort is located at the axis of three @entity8 in @entity3 's ‘ cultural triangle ’ – the imperial city of @entity10 ; the ruined @entity197 temples of @entity198 ; the former merchant town of @entity9			1
we fall in love with @entity9 within minutes			1
its riverside setting and centuries - old houses give it a rich feel of history , colourful lanterns hanging along every street			2
green and pleasant land : rice fields are an ever - visible presence in central @entity3 each morning , our five - minute walk into town from our riverside hotel , the @entity214 , is a feast for the senses – a daily exchange of greetings with the manager of the aptly - named launderette mr @entity221 , an attempt to pass through the throng of locals haggling in a series of giant food markets			1
the town stretches out into a series of shops , restaurants and cafes – many based in the teak buildings that traders once used			0
and beyond , the soft sands and ice cold drinks of @entity238 beach – a 30 - minute cycle ride from the hotel – prove just as picturesque			2
a six - night package including three nights at @entity244 ( @entity245 ) and three nights at @entity247 ( @entity248 ) costs from £ 989 per person , including breakfasts , flights with @entity252 from @entity253 and all transfers – via @entity255 ( 020 7666 1234 ; www.westernoriental.com )			2
alternatively , a six - night package including three nights at @entity244 ( @entity245 ) and three nights at @entity258 ( @entity259 ) costs from £ 1,259 per person , on the same basis .			2

@entity3 , traditionally a *backpacker* *destination* , has a new luxury ethos
the central coast around @entity9 and @entity10 is now home to five - star hotels
both of these towns are recognised as key @entity8
