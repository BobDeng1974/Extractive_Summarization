by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 11 july 2013 pay packets for bankers who work at bailed out lenders will be capped under new @entity5 rules			0
the crackdown on excessive pay is designed to put an end to multi-million pound deals for executives at banks that have received taxpayers ’ cash			1
under the new terms , senior staff at banks receiving any new bailouts would see their pay pegged to the wages enjoyed by ordinary people			1
top bankers who work at bailed out lenders are facing pay caps under new @entity5 rules @entity23 , who was axed last month as boss of @entity25 , was paid a basic salary of £ 1.2m for last year the maximum payout would be the higher of 15 times the national average salary or 10 times the wage of the average worker at the bank			1
the @entity33 ’s national average wage is £ 26,500 , according to the @entity34 , implying a pay ceiling for senior bankers of £ 397,500			1
@entity23 , who was axed last month as boss of @entity25 after a series of run - ins with chancellor @entity39 , was paid a basic salary of £ 1.2m for last year			1
the sum is about 45 times the @entity33 national average salary , although he passed up his bonus for the year			2
chancellor @entity39 is thought to fear that the plan will complicate his efforts to return @entity25 to private hands rise : bonus pay rose dramatically in april this year , according to figures from the @entity34 the @entity5 will also cap taxpayer - funded bonuses at twice the amount of an executive ’s basic wage			1
the rules will not be applied to banks which have already received aid , such as @entity25 and @entity56 , which required a rescue package worth £ 65billion			2
former @entity25 boss @entity58 was paid a salary of £ 1.3million the year before the bank had to be bailed out but they will apply to any bank that goes cap in hand to the government in future			1
the measures are intended to stop bankers taking reckless gambles in the knowledge that they will keep the profit , with taxpayers picking up the tab for losses in the event of a major mistake			0
some £ 1.4trillion of cash has been pumped into ailing lenders since the banking crisis began in 2008			0
@entity33 , which has a larger banking sector than @entity82 counterparts , is understood to have opposed the new pay caps			0
chancellor @entity39 is thought to fear that the plan , which will come into force next month , will complicate his efforts to potentially restructure @entity25 and find a new chief executive for the organisation			2
and @entity33 banks have lobbied fiercely against the new rules , which they say could limit their ability to attract talented executives			0
@entity93 has already put in place measures to cap pay at three of its bailed out banks at £ 430,000			0
the new pay rules arrived amid a broader revision of how to manage the failure of banks in the event of a financial crisis			0
the @entity104 will require shareholders and bondholders of banks to be wiped out before granting approval for governments to use taxpayers ’ cash to bail them out .			0
