by @entity0 last updated at 6:10 pm on 17th november 2011 after making an embarrassing blunder over foreign policy earlier this week , @entity1 must have thought his geographical woes were behind him			1
but the presidential candidate outdid himself on the campaign trail yesterday after sampling local delicacies in @entity10 's @entity9 community before asking : ' how do you say delicious in @entity9 ? ' the @entity14 @entity13 contender may have later realised that the national language of @entity16 is in fact @entity18			0
after sampling @entity9 coffee and ' croquetas ' of fried cheese and asking , ' how do you say delicious in @entity9 ? ' an audience member humoured the presidential hopeful by answering , ' @entity36 '			0
@entity1 had stopped in @entity37 yesterday to court voters in the state 's @entity9 - @entity40 and @entity41 communities			1
the same day , @entity1 managed to blunder again when he misstated the year of one of his own political party 's finest moments			2
in a speech at a rally at the @entity48 , he said @entity14 won back the @entity49 from the @entity50 in 2008 , when in fact it happened last year			0
memory lapse : @entity1 hesitated when asked if he agreed with @entity54 's decision to back @entity56 rebels in overthrowing @entity57 in a video interview earlier this week uncomfortable : @entity1 fidgeted in his chair and crossed his legs as he struggled for words he said : ' when the @entity40 people begin to ignite that @entity40 spirit , they make things happen , just like they made things happen in 2008 when the @entity14 took back control of the @entity13			1

the 65 - year - old suffered his own @entity74 ' oops ' moment when quizzed on his stance on @entity56			1
he seemed to be at a loss for words when the editorial board of a @entity80 newspaper asked if he supported president @entity54 's handling of the @entity56 uprising			2

when asked about his @entity80 meltdown yesterday , @entity1 did n't exactly make his stance clear			0
support : @entity1 spoke during a @entity91 interview , saying her husband has ' too much respect for women ' for the sexual harassment claims to be true happier times : @entity1 accompanies her husband @entity97 in may as he announces his run as a @entity14 candidate for president			1
