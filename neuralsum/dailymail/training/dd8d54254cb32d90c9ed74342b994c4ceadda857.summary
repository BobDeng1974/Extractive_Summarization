by @entity0 labour education spokesman @entity1 said the change would help to give teachers the same standing as professionals like doctors and lawyers teachers would have to be licensed and could be sacked if they fail tough checks on their abilities , under plans unveiled by @entity11			1
@entity12 education secretary @entity1 said the change would help give teachers the same standing as professionals such as doctors and lawyers			1
a similar proposal was floated by the previous @entity11 government - and branded ' classroom mots ' by former schools secretary @entity17			1
however , it was opposed by some teaching unions and dropped before the 2010 general election			0
reviving the controversial plan , mr @entity1 told the @entity22 he wanted the ' enormously important ' role of teachers to be recognised			1
' just like lawyers and doctors they should have the same professional standing which means re-licensing themselves , which means continued professional development , which means being the best possible they can be , ' he said			1
' if you 're not a motivated teacher - passionate about your subject , passionate about being in the classroom - then you should n't really be in this profession			1
' teachers would need to be able to show not only that they are teaching pupils to a high standard but also that they are keeping their subject knowledge and skills refreshed through regular training			2
those who fail to demonstrate that they had done so would be refused a licence to teach , effectively banning them from the profession			0
mr @entity1 would not be drawn on how often teachers would be assessed			1
in coming months he would be discussing the policy 's possible implementation with professional organisations , he said			0
teachers ' unions gave mr @entity1 's plan a guarded welcome , insisting that , for it to work , it must be linked to greater access to high - quality training			1
' with the fragmentation of our education system , access to high - quality continual professional development has been like finding an oasis in the desert , ' @entity57 of the @entity58 told @entity66			0
@entity67 , founder of education charity @entity68 , said that mr @entity1 's plan would bring the @entity70 into line with countries like @entity73 and @entity74 , which are renowned for their education systems			1
but @entity76 , general secretary of the @entity77 , warned against any policy that was a continuation of the @entity80 's ' judgemental prescription of how teachers teach			0
' mr @entity1 told @entity66 : ' if we want to re-professionalise the teachers it would be crazy not to do it			2
' if teachers are not re-licensed they will not be allowed to teach			0
' ' passionate ' : teachers would need to be able to show not only that they are teaching pupils to a high standard but also that they are keeping their subject knowledge and skills refreshed through regular training the @entity92 has previously said it would insist on all teachers having @entity93 , with staff already working in academies given a deadline to acquire a formal qualification			0
a @entity99 spokesman said it was willing to look any proposals which will ' genuinely improve the quality of teaching '			0
he said : ' we have already taken action by allowing heads to remove teachers from the classroom in a term , as opposed to a year previously , and scrapping the three - hour limit on classroom observations			2
' we are improving teacher training , expanding @entity68 and allowing heads to pay good teachers more			2
thanks to our reforms , a record proportion of top graduates are entering the profession			0
' fixing the schools system so young people have the skills they need is a key part of our long - term economic plan			0

@entity1 revives @entity17 ' old plan for ' classroom mots '
licence would give teachers similar professional standing as lawyers
' if you 're not a motivated teacher you should n't be in the classroom , ' he says
