historian @entity0 caused a furore when she remarked last year that she had been ' educated out of the natural reproductive function '			1
now it seems she might have had a point , after a new study has revealed a clear correlation between intelligence and childlessness - with cleverer women more likely to choose not to have a family			1
the study , which was conducted by @entity11 , a researcher at the @entity12 , found that a woman 's urge to have children decreases by a quarter for every 15 extra iq points			1
not keen : @entity17 , 44 , says that she decided never to have children at 14 and has ' no maternal urge ' clever and child - free : @entity23 and @entity0 have both said they do n't want to have a family when @entity11 , who used data from the @entity28 's @entity27 , added controls for economics and education , the results remained the same - the more intelligent the woman , the less likely she was to have children			1
@entity0 is n't the @entity28 's only famously clever childless woman , with others including @entity37 presenter @entity17 and actress @entity38			1
in the @entity41 , @entity39 , @entity23 and @entity40 are among the famous names who have said they 'll never become mothers , with @entity23 adding : ' i have the life i have because i do n't have children			2
' @entity48 too has said that she values her lifestyle too much to share it with children			0
' i do n't want kids , ' she said			0
' i love sleep and i worry about everything			0
' @entity56 , meanwhile , told the @entity57 that she just ' does n't have a maternal gene ' and resolved not to have children at the age of 14			1
' people are very judgmental , ' she added			0
' it 's as if i made a selfish decision not to have children , but i never , ever , wanted them			0
' unencumbered : @entity38 has said she never wanted children and @entity40 does n't want them either @entity56 and co certainly are n't alone , with figures released by the @entity69 revealing that the proportion of women without children has almost doubled since the 1990s			2
one in five 45 - year - olds is childless , while among those with degrees , the figure rises to 43 per cent , suggesting that @entity11 's findings are sound			2
a social study , conducted by social scientist dr @entity79 of the @entity80 , revealed that the notion that happiness comes from having children is illusory and offers yet another clue to why so many clever women are rejecting motherhood			2
' parents spend much of their time attending to the very core processes of childcare : problems at school , cooking , laundry , ' said @entity79 in an interview with the @entity57			0
' it 's these small but negative experiences that are more likely to impact on our day - to - day levels of happiness and life satisfaction			0

the findings show that *smarter* women are less likely to want babies
maternal urge decreases by a quarter for every 15 extra iq points
@entity0 has an iq of *140* which officially makes her a genius
