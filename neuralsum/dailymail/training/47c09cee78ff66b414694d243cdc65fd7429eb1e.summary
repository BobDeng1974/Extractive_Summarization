by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 15 february 2013 pictures allegedly showing the new ps4 controller reveal the device will incorporate a touchscreen built into the middle of the familiar dualshock layout			1
excitement over the next - generation console is building after @entity9 sent out invitations to an event on ' the future of the playstation ' to be held next week			1
a supposedly leaked image posted by games website @entity16 shows what appears to be an updated @entity19 controller plugged into software development kit			2
touch me : this apparently leaked image purports to show the controller for the hotly anticipated @entity24 , which @entity9 is expected to announce at an event to be held in @entity26 next wednesday the touchscreen is at the front , where the start and select buttons are found on the current generation of @entity33 controllers			1
the image appears to back up rumours circulating earlier this week which added @entity37 and @entity39 buttons have also been remodelled and improved			2
all eyes in the video games world are on @entity9 right now ahead of next wednesday 's event in @entity26 where the @entity44 tech firm is expected to unveil the new @entity24			1
@entity9 has kept its cards close to its chest regarding the expected launch , so far only officially releasing a teaser video via @entity49 announcing date of the event and calling on gamers to ' be the first to know '			1
the video also promoted a @entity55 hashtag , # @entity54 , to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event			2
asked about the purpose of the event , @entity59 , a spokesman for the company said only : ' we will be talking about the @entity33 business			0
' tantalising : a still from @entity9 's teaser video , published on @entity49 on january 31 , announcing the date of its event on ' the future of the playstation ' to be held in @entity26 next week console rival @entity69 is also believed to be gearing to launch its successor to the @entity71 , though it is understood the @entity73 giant is likely to delay announcement of the machine until the @entity77 show in june			1
observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for @entity81 , which could mean a battle for supremacy between @entity69 and @entity9 as their next - generation consoles go head - to - head in the vital holiday season market			1
due for an update : @entity69 is expected to announce the successor to its @entity71 console at june 's @entity77 , in time for a @entity81 launch date it has been more than six years since @entity9 launched the 70million - selling @entity92 , a longer gap than between it and its @entity94 predecessor , adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept			1
the last time @entity9 held a @entity33 event , in january 2011 , it presented a protoype of its handheld @entity100 console			1
before that , it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the @entity92 concept			0
a meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the @entity94			0
rumours surfaced last week that the new machine would be heavily focused on the cloud , which would put the @entity44 firm 's purchase last year of a leading cloud - based gaming company into perspective			2
@entity9 paid $ 380million for @entity113 in june last year			1
at the time @entity9 's chief executive , @entity114 , said : ' by combining @entity113 's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with @entity115 's [ @entity115 ] extensive game platform knowledge and experience , @entity115 will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences			1
' @entity115 will deliver a world - class cloud - streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime , anywhere on a variety of internet - connected devices			0
' the @entity100 : the portable console , successor to the @entity136 , was unveiled the last time @entity9 held a @entity33 event , in january 2011 as well as the touchpad controller , the new console is expected to have an eight - core x64 @entity141 processor ( codenamed ' @entity142 ) , @entity143 of @entity144 , @entity145 of video ram , four usb ports that use the new high - speed usb 3.0 standard , a blu - ray drive , a hard drive of @entity151 , an @entity152 , and both @entity154 and optical outputs			1
specs for the next - generation @entity156 are rumored to be comparable , with insiders suggesting that it will also pack @entity159 of @entity144 , @entity154 connectors and usb 3.0			0
however , video gamers have been horrified by rumours that the @entity69 machine will only work with the @entity166 sensor plugged in and that it will only run games registered to the machine - potentially blocking not only second - hand games but also games borrowed from friends			0
the co-founder of @entity156 has launched a scathing attack on @entity69 for ' five years of failure ' - and claimed that @entity176 could ‘ kill them ’ at any given moment			0
former xbox engineer @entity178 - who came up with the console ’s name ( albeit spelled @entity181 ) - slammed @entity69 for failing to capitalise on innovations such as @entity166 and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device			2
the attack follows reports that @entity69 are likely to announce their @entity71 successor , codenamed @entity190 , at @entity77 in @entity191 in june this year			0
writing on his blog ilike.code , under the title ‘ stupid , @entity181 ’ , @entity178 said : ‘ the past 5 years , and the last year in particular , have been simply painful to watch			0
' coasting on past momentum			0
failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like @entity166			0
touting strategic and market success when you ’re just experiencing your competitor ’s stumbling failure ( yes , @entity9 , @entity199 – you are , i ’m afraid , stumbling failures )			1
' a complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room			0
’ the @entity24 could cost as little as £ 270 when it launches later this year , according to a report in a @entity44 newspaper			1
the @entity208 reported that @entity9 's new gaming console will cost 40,000 yen - which translates to about £ 270			1
however , @entity211 gamers will have to factor in @entity212 , which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price , taking the possible @entity211 figure to around £ 325			0
even at that price , the @entity24 will be a @entity92 cost 60,000 yen when it launched in @entity44 2006			1
the new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in @entity26 on february 20			2
if the price is as low as the rumours suggest , it could steal a march on @entity69 's next - generation xbox console , which does n't yet have a launch date			1
@entity69 's console , which could be named the @entity156 720 , could be announced at the annual @entity77 gaming conference , held in @entity191 in june			2
observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for @entity81 , which could mean a battle for supremacy between @entity69 and @entity9			1
the launches are important for both companies , as gamers have moved away from consoles since the @entity71 and the @entity92 débuted			0
more and more people have shifted to tablets and smartphones as a gaming platform			0
analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today 's games consoles within a few years			2
many are already able to run the kinds of @entity249 games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high - spec gaming @entity251 last hurrah : the @entity253			0
@entity9 are still actively marketing the console , and are releasing it in two different colours tomorrow @entity256 : the @entity258 ' super-slim ' units may represent one last push of their current gen hardware despite next - gen rumours and stiff competition from mobile devices , @entity9 are still actively marketing the @entity264			2
the company today released the console in two different colours			0
the new limited edition @entity268 and @entity258 ' super-slim ' units seem to represent one last push of their current generation hardware .			0

pictures show a device broadly similar to @entity9 's dualshock controller
however the select and start buttons have been *replaced* by touchscreen
excitement is building over expected *imminent* launch of @entity24
