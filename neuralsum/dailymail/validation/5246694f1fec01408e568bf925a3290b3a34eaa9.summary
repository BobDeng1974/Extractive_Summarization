a morbidly obese woman , who lost 165lbs in order to qualify for gastric bypass surgery , nearly derailed the impact of the life - saving procedure when she allowed emergency room doctors to insert a feeding tube into her stomach for malnourishment - without consulting her weight - loss surgeon			1
when @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , joined @entity14 's obesity series my 600lbs life , she weighed 570lbs and was consuming between 10 and 12lbs of food a day			1
but after realizing that her weight was forcing her to miss out on her son @entity20 's life , she made the decision to travel to @entity23 to have weight loss specialist dr @entity25 perform surgery as a final attempt to save her family and her life			1
following her surgery however , the 42 - year - old mom began experiencing nausea and allowed her boyfriend @entity33 take her to the hospital - instead of contacting her surgeon like she was instructed – where doctors inserted a feeding tube into her stomach , believing that she was ‘ malnourished ’			1
' he was pretty upset			0
' she added : ' i feel like i keep getting close to getting my life back and then something happens			2
i just want to keep making progress and get back to living again			0
' dr @entity25 demanded that @entity10 travel to see him in @entity23 immediately , so he could assess the amount of damage that was done by the doctors in @entity11			1
' i am hoping i did n't make the wrong decision and will regret it for the rest of my life , ' @entity10 said			1
in his office , dr @entity25 had her read the written instructions he had given her after her gastric bypass , which included a line about calling her surgeon if she started vomiting			1
while @entity10 said she could n't call because she did n't have a phone on her , @entity33 explained that he genuinely believed she was just sick and would be sent back home			1
bad decision : @entity10 's weight loss surgeon , dr @entity25 , scolded @entity10 and her boyfriend @entity33 for letting other doctors give her a feeding tube after her gastric bypass , essentially derailing her progress medical mistake : @entity10 experienced extreme nausea after her surgery , but instead of calling her doctor , she went to the emergency room where she was misdiagnosed as malnourished and given a feeding tube ' you do n't have to have a phone , ' dr @entity25 told her			1
' every hospital has a phone			0
' he could n't believe that she would have another surgery without contacting him			2
' what in the world is this ? ' dr @entity25 said as he inspected the tubes that were placed in @entity10 's stomach			2
' why in the world does she need a feeding tube ? ' he added : ' she should not have allowed other doctors to do this			1
' dr @entity25 explained that the feeding tube had essentially undone the effect of her bypass and it needed to be closed off , so she could continue to lose weight			1
while the procedure to rectify the damage she had done went well , it was another road block in @entity10 's ongoing battle to lose weight			1
caregiver : before her weight loss surgery , @entity10 relied on her boyfriend @entity33 to do everything for her , include bathe her out of control : @entity10 said that even though she felt like an ' oversized whale ' , she could n't stop eating			1
@entity33 guessed that she consumed 10 to 12lbs of food a day full of love : @entity10 hugged her son @entity20 , who she was unable to play with outside because of her size before meeting dr @entity25 , @entity10 's weight was spiraling out of control			1
she was unable to play with @entity20 , and she relied on @entity33 to take care of her			0
' i 'm ashamed of it			0
it 's just embarrassing , ' she said			0
' i see myself as an oversized whale			0
i just hate my body			0
' she noted that she ' used to feel beautiful ' before she lost control of her life			2
although she had grown up thin , she started to rapidly gain weight after her mother forced her to give up her first child , a baby girl , after she got pregnant when she was just 14 years old			1
' my only choice was to give her up for adoption , ' she told the camera			2
' i just felt lost after that			0
that was one of the most painful experiences of my life , and i think about it all the time			2
' she continued : ' i turned to food for comfort , and that 's when i started gaining the weight			1
' disbelief : @entity10 sobbed during her first visit to dr @entity25 's office in @entity23			2
she could n't believe that she let her weight spiral to 570lbs natural size : @entity10 grew up thin and did n't have a problem with her weight until she got pregnant with her first child at 14 years old seeking solace : after her mom forced her to give her baby girl up for adoption , she went from being thin ( left ) to rapidly gaining weight ( right ) because she turned to food during her time of grief when she met @entity33 , she weighed 405lbs , but her size did n't bother him			1
he was attracted to her personality and smile			0
after eight years together , they found out she was pregnant with @entity20			2
according to @entity33 , @entity10 went into a postpartum depression when @entity20 was born that she never came out of			2
' she just stopped living , ' he said			0
he went on to say that she has no idea how much she eats a day , explaining that she consumes 10 to 12lbs of food a day			0
@entity33 had reached his limits and was debating leaving her for the sake of their son			0
' @entity20 is very aware of his mom 's weight , ' he said			2
' it is really affecting him too			0
he does n't get to go outside a lot because i literally can not leave the house for very long because she is not able to care for herself			0
' he added : ' this is n't what i signed up for			0
i feel like a single dad all the time			0
she is here but not really			0
i feel like she just quit on me			0
' mental health : as a part of her weight loss plan , @entity10 began seeing a therapist , so she could stop blaming herself for giving up her baby no choice : @entity10 started to cry while she told her therapist how she was forced to put her baby up for adoption @entity10 reached out to dr @entity25 in order to save her family and regain life because she had hit her ' breaking point '			1
she feared that her son would grow up without a mom because she could n't take charge			2
however , when she traveled to @entity23 in hopes of receiving weight loss surgery , she was ordered to lose 50lbs before they could proceed			1
' i 'm not going to think about it			0
i am doing it , ' @entity10 told @entity33 of shedding pounds			2
months later , @entity10 lost 165lbs and was ready for surgery , but there were even more complications			1
dr @entity25 had to stop in the midst of surgery because he discovered excessive - scar tissue from previous surgeries , which he attempted to remove			2
' this surgery is the last chance to save my family , and i feel like i am losing it , ' @entity10 later explained			1
dr @entity25 was eventually able to give her the gastric bypass she so desperately needed , and @entity10 continued to make progress			1
after surgery she even went to one of @entity20 's football games , something she was never able to do before			0
making memories : @entity10 was finally able to go with @entity33 to watch @entity20 's football game after her weight loss surgery all alone : @entity33 can be seen helping @entity20 with his football pads			1
before @entity10 started losing weight , he said he felt like a single parent life - changing : @entity10 's weight loss allowed her to get out of bed and spend quality time with @entity33 and @entity20 for the first time in years but the feeding tube she was later given threatened to ruin everything			1
' we are dodging a bullet today , ' dr @entity25 said when he fixed @entity10 's botched surgery			1
after all of her struggles , @entity10 was still determined to lose weight and take control of her life			1
in addition to following her diet and becoming more active , she started seeing a therapist to learn why she is ' sad all of the time '			0
during one of her sessions @entity10 discussed how traumatic it was for her to give her first child up for adoption			1
her therapist helped her realize that she had no choice and she ca n't keep blaming herself what happened in the past			0
@entity10 continued to get better both mentally and physically			2
she started helping around the house and going to all of @entity20 's games			0
making progress : a year after she started chronicling her journey for my 600lbs life , @entity10 was excited to learn that she weighed 261lbs before and after : @entity10 lost half her body weight and returned to a size she had n't seen since high school for the first time in years , @entity10 was happy to go shopping for new clothes because she knew they would now fit her body ' i do n't want to miss a single thing from here on out , ' she said			1
