mr @entity9 , who fled @entity10 in the 1970s aged 17 to become a successful businessman , running a takeaway and two supermarkets , died four days after the attack in hospital from a head injury			2
delivering his verdict , @entity44 coroner @entity43 said the weight of evidence was that mr @entity9 was struck while involved in an argument , although he had not assaulted anyone			2
he said he was in a ‘ dilemma ’ as law prevented him making findings in contradiction of the earlier proceedings - and he could not necessarily draw conclusions from the evidence ‘ as i might like ’			0
but after the inquest , mr @entity9 ’s family said in a statement : ‘ the decision of the @entity61 not to prosecute anyone over @entity9 ’s death and not to let a jury hear the evidence sends out the wrong message			1
‘ we are shocked by the mismanagement of the case and feel a double loss - the loss of @entity9 and the loss of justice			1
' the failure to prosecute this case to trial represents a serious failure by the @entity61 to demonstrate its commitment to protect the public			0

one of the women , @entity106 , said of @entity12 : ‘ he did n’t seem as if he was on the same planet as me , he was swaying around			2
’ another , @entity109 , said : ‘ he hit @entity103 and he went down and his glasses went onto the pool table			0
i never saw @entity103 do anything			0
he just went down like a skittle and his head hit the floor			0
’ @entity116 said the businessman told @entity12 he had been rude to the women and was then punched by him			1
‘ he went down like a sack of spuds , ’ he said			0
‘ he hit him with all his weight			0
’ mr @entity9 , from @entity121 , @entity88 , was attacked in october 2010			1
@entity12 , an air conditioning fitter from @entity123 , @entity88 was arrested and in two police interviews admitted he ‘ snapped and lashed out ’ at mr @entity9			1
' we are shocked by the mismanagement of the case and feel a double loss - the loss of @entity9 and the loss of justice ' @entity9 's family he was charged with manslaughter but cleared in february , 2011 after the @entity61 were ‘ unable to disprove the issue of self - defence ’			1
@entity12 had only raised the issue of self - defence in his second police interview two days after mr @entity9 died			1
@entity139 dr @entity138 said it was a ‘ heavy punch ’ which caused mr @entity9 to collapse and he was likely to have been rendered unconscious immediately			2
mr @entity12 told the inquest mr @entity9 began shouting at him after he made a remark to the women and his cousin grabbed him by the neck			1
in his first police statement read at the inquest , @entity12 said : ‘ i just lashed out at him			1
’ he could not remember what started the incident but may have made a comment ‘ in jest ’ to the women			0
during his second interview he said he felt ‘ extremely threatened ’ and struck @entity9 to get him away			2
the coroner said in his findings : ‘ it is clear that the initial row developed because of a racist remark by mr @entity12			2
‘ it is also apparent that words ( but no blows ) had been exchanged between mr @entity9 and mr @entity12 just prior to the punch being thrown			1
‘ those who actually saw the punch were virtually unanimous in describing it as a very hard blow			0
’ location : mr @entity9 was enjoying a game of pool with his cousin @entity81 and the company of four women friends who were celebrating a birthday at the @entity86 pub in @entity87 , @entity88 his narrative verdict read : ‘ @entity9 died at the @entity176 , @entity88 , of head injuries received in consequence of a single punch to the head delivered with great force during or immediately after an altercation ( that was primarily between others over a racist remark ) at the @entity86 pub. ’ @entity189 victim ’s only son @entity187 , 25 , and his sister @entity190 , said they were devastated at the ‘ absolute violation ’ of mr @entity9 ’s human rights			1
‘ we believe that a jury should have had the opportunity to consider and come to a conclusion on the evidence in this case and we do not understand why that was not permitted to happen , ’ they said			0
‘ we have now heard the evidence given before the coroner and we understand that decision even less			0
’ @entity203 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for @entity44 and @entity204 , said : ‘ we are aware of the comments of the coroner mr @entity43 in relation to the @entity61 ’s decision not to prosecute @entity12 for allegedly causing the death of mr @entity9 in 2010			1
' i just lashed out at him			0
i just snapped ' @entity12 ‘ the burden of proof required for a criminal court is greater than that of a coroner ’s court			2
in a criminal court we must prove " beyond reasonable doubt " that the person committed all elements of the crime alleged			0
‘ the prosecution must also disprove any defence that the defendant was acting in self - defence			0
we worked closely with @entity228 and , based on the evidence available at the time , the @entity61 advised that @entity12 should be charged with manslaughter for the killing of mr @entity9			1
‘ shortly before trial three new witness accounts were brought to the attention of @entity61			0
their evidence undermined the prosecution case as it supported the defence case that @entity12 was acting in self - defence			2
‘ by law we must disclose to the defence any material in the case which could undermine the prosecution or assist the defence			0
we can not simply select the evidence which supports a prosecution			0
‘ we are also bound by the @entity247 to consider at all stages of a case whether there remains a realistic prospect of a conviction and only proceed if this test is met			0
‘ after very careful consideration , taking into account this new evidence , we concluded that this was no longer the case and halted the prosecution			0
‘ at the earliest possible opportunity we informed mr @entity9 ’s family and the court that the charge would be dropped			1
we also met mr @entity9 ’s family to explain our decision			2
‘ mr @entity12 was convicted of having an offensive weapon and received a conditional discharge and £ 775 costs			0
our deepest sympathies are with mr @entity9 ’s family			2
