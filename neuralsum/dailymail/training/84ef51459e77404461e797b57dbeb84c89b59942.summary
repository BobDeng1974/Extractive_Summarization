@entity80 , @entity81 @entity14 spokesperson , who carried out the survey , said : ' we were quite alarmed at the apparent lack of basic hygiene from some respondents			0
' unclean bed sheets contain the tens of thousands of dead skin cells that we shed every night , and by going months without cleaning them you ’re risking some distinctly unpleasant consequences every time you go to bed			2
' dust mites would find a perfect habitat in such unhygienic bed sheets , and it 's well documented that they can cause allergic flare - ups , asthma , rhinitis and other physical reactions			0
