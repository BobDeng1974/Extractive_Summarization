by @entity1 reporter published : 07:23 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 10:44 est , 4 march 2014 while most cats love nothing better than lying indoors by the fire , five - month - old kitten @entity3 is no ordinary feline			1
he loves his owners , @entity10 , 30 , and @entity11 , 25,so much that he can not bear to be parted from them for a moment , which means that when they go for a walk , he goes too			2
and if the weather 's bad , he simply hops into mr @entity10 's backpack			1
when they went out for a walk along the coastline of @entity41 , little @entity3 was so frightened by the strong winds that he scrambled onto mr @entity44 's back and into his rucksack			2
now the tabby cat has made a habit of it			0
ms @entity11 , who like mr @entity10 is a phd medical engineering student at @entity49 , said : ' he gets quite cosy in the backpack , and he likes looking around at what 's going on			1
' she said : ' @entity53 organised the trip to the @entity55 as a birthday surprise from me and , knowing how much i like @entity3 , he decided to bring him along , too , although it was pretty random			2
she said the couple went for a picnic on the windswept beach and took the kitten along with them because it does n't like being separated from them			0
' it was his first time being out in nature - he had never been outside our tiny flat in @entity70 's @entity69 before - and we did n't know how he would react			1
@entity3 ' owner , @entity10 , took the cat with him when he organised a surprise trip to the @entity55 the kitten lives in a flat in @entity70 's @entity69 with owners @entity10 and @entity11 ' we were pleased when he came with us , but when the wind got up we were worried about sand getting in his eyes , so we put him in @entity53 's rucksack			1
' later , he was just running around but the wind was quite strong again , and he must have remembered about the rucksack as he climbed up on @entity53 and found his way into the rucksack			0
' ms @entity11 said her pet had characteristics more suited to a dog than a cat			0
she said : ' he likes crawling around and he fetches things as well - he is like a dog in cat 's skin			0
he is quite a strange cat , but i really like him			0
' the adventurous kitten is more like a dog than a cat , according to its owner , phd student ms @entity11 the couple took him to @entity103 last weekend , and because they had to cycle past an area popular with dogs to get there , they put him in mr @entity10 's rucksack again			1
ms @entity11 said : ' it would be great to have a dog - free park where @entity3 could just run around			0
' the couple named their kitten after @entity117 - winning @entity116 physicist , @entity3 , 84 , who discovered the @entity120 ' @entity119 particle '			1
ms @entity11 added : ' i 'm a very geeky scientist and so is @entity53 , and @entity3 got his @entity117 around the same time that we got him			2
' i call him my fluffy particle			0
