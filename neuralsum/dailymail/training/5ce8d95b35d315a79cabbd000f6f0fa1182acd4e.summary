by @entity0 how much would you spend on a pair of jeans ? the received wisdom is that , as you get older , you should pay more for your denims to get clever cuts that disguise saggy or wobbly bits			1
but is this really true ? @entity9 challenged me to blind test a selection of jeans costing from £ 5 to £ 500 , and guess the prices			1
the results astonished me — and may change the way you shop			1
the high waist failed to add any oomph and they looked too traditional and felt a little outdated and basic			0
the petrol blue colour was a bit flat			0
i ’d have liked more zing			0
my guess : £ 5			1
i thought these were definitely the cheapest ! for £ 90 i ’d want something far classier			1
£ 495 , @entity31 , selfridges.com black jeans are almost as essential as a good bra			1
but these emphasised my thigh bulges , which i could do without			0
my guess : £ 90			1
oops ! i ’ve boobed this time			0
they felt good quality , but do n’t justify that price tag			1
£ 45 , oasis - @entity39 the colour is pretty and original , while the fit is a bit loose , but soft and easy			1
i ’d say they ’re for slobbing around in at weekends rather than sharpening up with a natty little jacket			0
my guess : £ 35			2
phew ! not so far out this time ! £ 245 , trilogystores.com these did it for me ; i loved them			2
they made me feel years younger and were easy to wear , i could n’t ask for more			0
my guess : £ 500			1
well , they ’re halfway there ! and worth it — i ’ll start saving up			0
£ 5 , everything5pounds.com i liked these			1
they had just the right amount of stretch , giving me room to breathe			0
my guess : £ 100			2
wow ! i ’d never have guessed ! i can see now the finish is n’t perfect , but they ’re incredible value			0
£ 12.99 , newlook.com not a kind cut			2
these jeans widened my hips , which need minimising on a good day			2
@entity65 heels improved the look , but still no good for pear shapes			0
my guess : £ 15			2
close — it ’s obvious that these are from the lower end of the spectrum .			0

we all believe that the more you pay for your jeans the better quality you get - but is it true ?
@entity0 blind tests a selection of jeans ranging from £ 5 to £ 500 and guesses the prices
the results may *surprise* you and change your jean - *buying* *habits*
