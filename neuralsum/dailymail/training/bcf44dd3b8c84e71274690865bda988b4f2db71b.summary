@entity0 has been warned by @entity1 that he expects him to ‘ fight against my decision ’ if the manager opts to make @entity5 his first - choice goalkeeper for the forthcoming season			1
@entity5 , 22 , has joined @entity7 on their pre-season tour with the rest of the @entity11 contingent following their @entity13 rest and he is set to start in sunday 's friendly at @entity14			1
@entity0 , 32 , has indicated he will not be happy warming the bench but the manager is adamant there will be no sentimentality in the fight for the goalkeeping position			2
‘ if i have to put @entity5 on the bench , it is not a problem			2
the fact that we have two fantastic goalkeepers is not a problem for me			0
it was logical that @entity5 had to be back			0
' it would make no sense to have such a great young keeper and not have him back			0
in the end it will be my decision and nobody else ’s			0
experience : @entity0 will have to be wary of @entity5 as he looks to extend his @entity7 career ‘ they have to work hard and wait for my decision , then fight against my decision if they are on the bench			1
’ @entity1 has little truck with the suggestion that dissatisfaction from @entity0 ( right ) could precipitate his departure			1
‘ everybody says the same , ’ he said			0
‘ if somebody says i ’m happy on the bench , then what are you doing here ? @entity0 says the obvious , @entity5 says the same			1
@entity64 is 42 and he will say he ’s not happy being the third choice and will fight hard to try and be @entity66 again			0

@entity0 has been an ever - present at @entity7 for 10 years but that has role has been cast into doubt by @entity1
the *special* one has *admitted* @entity5 ' *superb* form ca *n't* be ignored any *longer*
@entity1 says @entity0 must fight against any decision he may make
