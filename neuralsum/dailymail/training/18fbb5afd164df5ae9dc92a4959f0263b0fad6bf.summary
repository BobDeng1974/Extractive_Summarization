by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 19:22 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 23 january 2013 when it comes to the male of the species , an inch makes all the difference			0
two @entity9 men are suing @entity10 , claiming the world 's biggest fast - food chain has been shorting them by selling so - called footlong sandwiches that are closer to 11 inches rather than 12			1
the pair - @entity14 , of @entity15 and @entity16 , of @entity17 - want compensatory damages and a change in @entity10 's practices			1
at the time , the company issued a statement saying that the sandwich lengths can vary a bit when franchises do not bake to the exact corporate standards			2
but @entity43 , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , says that 's no excuse and the missing bite is worth about 45 cents per sandwich			1
he is seeking class - action status and is also preparing to file a similar suit in @entity52 state court in @entity53			1
he said he 's had sandwiches from 17 shops measured - and every one came up short			1
' the case is about holding companies to deliver what they 've promised , ' he said			0
even though the alleged short of a half - inch or so of bread is relatively small , it adds up , he said			2
@entity10 has 38,000 stores around the world , nearly all owned by franchisees and its $ 5 footlong specials have been a mainstay of the company 's ads for five years			1
@entity10 's previous adverts , like this popular ' @entity72 ' dance , have suggested that a footlong sandwich will measure one foot in length how long ? this @entity10 promotion in 2008 showed a range of characters measuring out one foot with their hands @entity43 said both @entity14 and @entity16 came to him after reading last week about the short sandwiches			1
the @entity82 , @entity83 - based firm should either make sure its sandwiches measure a full foot or stop advertising them as such , he said			2
he points to how @entity88 's quarter - pounders are advertised as being that weight before they are cooked			2
@entity10 said it could n't comment on pending or ongoing legal action but the company responded to international criticism that their footlong sandwiches only appear to be 11 inches long on saturday			1
but their reply did n't win them any new fans , as they claimed that the word footlong is a ' registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub ' and ' not intended to be a measurement of length			0
' a man in @entity106 started uproar on january 15 when he posted a photo on the company 's @entity34 page of one of its footlong subs next to a tape measure showing the sandwich as just 11 inches			1
countless lookalike pictures appeared all over the internet and more than 100,000 people ' liked ' or commented on the original , which had the caption ' @entity10 pls respond			1
' economic sense : during the recession @entity10 began advertising $ 5 footlongs the world 's largest fast food chain did so on friday with a comment on the original query , posted by @entity126 from @entity127 , @entity106			1
the statement began : ' looking at the photo doing the rounds showing a slightly undersized sub , this bread is not baked to our standards			0
' then @entity10 went on the offensive , claiming that a footlong sub was n't necessarily meant to be exactly a foot long in the first place			1
' with regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong , " @entity149 " is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in @entity146 and not intended to be a measurement of length			0
' ' the length of the bread baked in the restaurant can not be assured each and every time as the proofing process may vary slightly each time in the restaurant			0
' @entity10 have since removed the statement but , as @entity159 pointed out , this was at odds with previous @entity10 advertising			2
furor : a man in @entity106 started uproar on january 15 when he posted a photo on the company 's @entity34 page of one of its footlong subs next to a tape measure showing the sandwich as just 11 inches likes : more than 100,000 people ' liked ' or commented on the original , which had the caption ' @entity10 pls respond ' the company has suggested in past promotional material that the footlong sub will measure a foot in length , such as a popular 2008 ' hula ' advert ( see below )			1
the @entity10 photo — and the backlash — illustrates a challenge companies face with the growth of social media sites like @entity34 , @entity188 and @entity189			1
before , someone in a far flung local in @entity106 would not be able to cause such a stir			2
but the power of social media means that negative posts about a company can spread from around the world in seconds			0
' people look for the gap between what companies say and what they give , and when they find the gap — be it a mile or an inch — they can now raise a flag and say , ' hey look at this , ' i caught you , ' said @entity209 , managing director of branding firm @entity210 in @entity211			0
@entity10 has always offered footlong sandwiches since it opened in 1965			1
a customer can order any sandwich as a footlong			2
the chain introduced a $ 5 footlong promotion in 2008 as the @entity218 fell into the recession , and has continued offering the popular option throughout the recovery			0
viral : countless lookalike pictures appeared all over the internet within hours response : @entity10 finally responded on saturday to the debacle an attempt to contact someone with the same name and country as the person who posted the photo of the footlong sandwich on @entity10 's facebook page was not returned on thursday			1
but comments by other @entity34 users about the photo ran the gamut from outrage to indifference to amusement			0
one commenter urged people to ' chill out			0
' another one said she was switching to @entity245			0
and one man posted a photo of his foot in a sock next to a @entity10 sandwich to show it was shorter than a ' foot			1
' ' i 've never seen so many people in an uproar over an inch			0
wow , ' read one @entity34 post			0
' let 's all head to @entity88 's and weigh a @entity259 , ' suggested another poster			0
the @entity10 footlong photo is just the latest in a string of public relations headaches that were caused by a negative photo or event about a company going viral			2
last year , a @entity268 employee tweeted a picture of someone standing in sneakers on two tubs of uncovered lettuce			0
@entity275 employees posted a video on @entity188 of workers defacing a pizza in 2009			0
and a @entity280 employee last year made a disparaging remark about president @entity282 using the official @entity189 account .			0
