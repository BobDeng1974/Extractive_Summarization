@entity9 was given a yellow card by referee @entity11 in the first half for a clash with @entity14 but the @entity16 manager could not believe the @entity5 striker remained on the field			1
‘ @entity14 has got a horribly broken nose , ’ @entity0 revealed			0
‘ the boy @entity9 gets a yellow card but we ’re incensed			2

if he ’s seen a forearm smash in @entity14 ’s face you do wonder			0
@entity9 ’s got away with it , from what i ’ve seen from the dvd he meant it			2
’ to compound @entity0 ’s misery , @entity9 went on to seal the victory in the 81st minute , finishing off a good passing move to score his first league goal since december 20 , ending a drought of 1,245 minutes			1
‘ it will help him a lot , ’ @entity5 manager @entity60 said			2

@entity124 , @entity125 - like with his tireless running down either flank , had won the spot kick by racing down the right before being chopped down by @entity0 - perhaps somewhat dazed and confused from his blow to the face - inside the box and @entity69 calmly placed it beyond @entity34 ’s reach into the right of goal for his first of the campaign			1
there was almost an incident when @entity139 initially picked the ball up to take the kick			0
‘ i had to shout to our captain @entity65 to stop @entity139 , ’ @entity60 admitted			0
‘ it was a difficult situation			0
@entity106 and @entity74 are our first and second choice to take penalties			2
it ’s a problem with @entity139 , but the rules in the team are more important			0

@entity91 held the ball up on the edge of the box and laid off to @entity153 whose powerful shot almost caught out @entity5 goalkeeper @entity155 only for him to keep it out one - handed			1
on the hour mark , only one behind , @entity16 ’s @entity158 had @entity72 beaten with a glancing header from a corner only for @entity67 to clear off the line			2
before kick off , the omens were not good for the visitors who had not won away to @entity5 since february 1951 and the 64 - year wait to amend that will go on			1
two home wins against relegation rivals @entity170 and @entity171 in mid-february left them full of hope and optimism of surviving the season			0
but since then they have not won in six and this was the fourth defeat of that barren spell			0
