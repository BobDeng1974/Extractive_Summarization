by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 09:28 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 15 november 2012 @entity2 is recalling 75,000 vehicles in @entity4 because of a steering wheel fault which could result in a ‘ loss of steering ability ’ affecting 2.7 million cars worldwide			1
part of the lower steering column innards near the driver ’s knee may ‘ deform ’ under certain conditions , said @entity2			2
the @entity4 recall affects the best - selling petrol - electric hybrid @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity4 - built avensis models , though globally some nine models are affected			1
recall : around 2.7 million toyotas have been recalled worldwide , including the popular @entity22 ( pictured ) concerns : a total of nine models have been recalled worldwide , including the @entity17 ( pictured ) all of which were built between august 2000 and april 2009 safety : @entity2 insists the problem thought to be affecting some of the vehicles - including corolla models ( pictured ) is not a safety risk the steering - wheel fault can lead to ‘ a reduction in steering response ’ and a ‘ loss of steering ability ’ , said @entity2 which insisted no accidents had yet been reported			1
the avensis is built at @entity38 in @entity39			0
the recalls follow nine complaints across @entity42 about faulty steering and three reported cases of separate water - pump problems which are specific to the @entity17 hybrids alone			1
it is the latest in a long line of @entity2 recalls and comes just four weeks after the firm recalled more than seven million vehicles worldwide , including some @entity18 and @entity52 models , over faulty window switches			1
@entity54 said it had registered recalls for certain @entity22 and @entity18 models ( july 2001 to march 2009 ) and for @entity17 ( july 2003 to april 2009 ) with the @entity57 ( @entity57 )			1
all models are ‘ previous generation ’ and not new models currently on sale , it said			2
the models affected were built between august 2000 and april 2009 according to @entity2			2
the ' hybrid vehicles ' may have problems with their water pumps while the other cars affected could have faults with their steering columns			1
the models affected in the @entity4 are the best - selling @entity22 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
other hybrid models affected worldwide include the @entity71 , the @entity72 and the @entity73			1
the popular @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity18 , the @entity78 and the @entity79 have also been called in by the the car giant			2
setting out the problem , @entity54 said : ‘ on certain @entity22 , @entity18 and @entity17 models ( july 2001 to april 2009 ) there is a possibility of an issue with a component in the steering system , prompting a knocking or rattling and possibly a reduction in steering response			1
' components called ‘ splines ’ – a form of tubular locking device - which ‘ connect the extension shaft to the steering gearbox may deform if the steering wheel is frequently and forcefully while driving at slow speeds			2
@entity2 says affected vehicles ' remain safe to drive ' - and that there have been no reports of accidents caused by the problem			1
nine cases of the problem have been reported in @entity42			0
@entity2 dealers will carry out inspections to see if parts need to be replaced - which will take around an hour			0
explaining the technical problem with the faulty steering , @entity2 said there was ‘ insufficient hardness of the steering shaft ’			2
‘ this deformation may create increased internal clearance and the splines may eventually , over time , wear out			0
’ @entity115 executives said this ‘ could result in loss of steering ability			0
’ @entity2 dealers will inspect the extension shaft to determine if it needs to be replaced and , if confirmed , will replace it			0
the inspection and repair will take approximately one hour			0
on the water pump fault affecting only the @entity17 , @entity2 said : ’ there is an electrically driven water pump that circulates coolant through the hybrid components			1
there is a possibility that the electric motor installed in the water pump may stop functioning , leading to illumination of various warning lights in the instrument panel			1
in limited instances , the water pump electric power supply circuit fuse may open causing the hybrid system to stop while the vehicle is being driven			1
’ ‘ should this happen it will be indicated by a warning light being illuminated on the dashboard			0
’ it noted : ‘ it is possible that some @entity17 will require attention for both issues			2
’ @entity54 said : ‘ customer satisfaction is of paramount importance to @entity2			0
consequently , @entity2 has decided to conduct recall activity to replace the hybrid system water pump and check steering shaft performance on the affected cars			1
’ checks : the affected @entity2 will be checked for the problem at official dealerships ( file picture ) @entity54 said it will contact the owners of all affected vehicles within the next six weeks , asking them to make an appointment to bring their car to their nearest @entity2 dealer			2
dealers will replace the hybrid system water pump and / or inspect the steering shaft : ‘ if the steering shaft does not meet @entity2 inspection criteria , it will be repaired			1
’ it said the water pump replacement ‘ should take no more than an hour - and - a - half ’			1
if required , the steering shaft repair should be completed in an hour			0
this work will be carried out free of charge			0
owners are being directed to the @entity54 web site ( www.toyota.co.uk ) where they can check their registration number and @entity174 numbers to see if their vehicle is within the affected range of production			0
@entity2 is @entity115 's biggest carmaker and for a period became the world ’s biggest			0
@entity4 made : the avensis is made at @entity2 's assembly plant in @entity38 , @entity39 ( pictured ) but experts say that dash for growth led to @entity2 ‘ taking its eye off the ball ’ in terms of quality – something on which the @entity115 car - maker had established a reputation so strong its ethos was taught in business schools – the ‘ @entity194 ’			0
@entity2 's latest announcement pushes the number of recalls this year to more than 10 million , not far short of the number recalled in 2009 and 2010 over floormat and accelerator pedal issues			2
that recall involved more than 12 million vehicles and led to fines from @entity205 regulators and reputational damage for @entity2 whose sales suffered badly			1
the @entity115 carmaker is still trying to rebuild its reputation and regain customer trust after that fiasco , which saw the firm 's head apologising to consumers			0
but its efforts to do so have been dealt a blow over the past few weeks , as it has announced recalls totalling nearly 10 million vehicles			1
however , some analysts said that while the latest recalls , which are voluntary , were a setback , they might not cause as much damage to its reputation as the ones in 2009			0
@entity226 , a motor industry analyst with @entity228 in @entity229 said : ' nobody is perfect			0
vehicles nowadays are very complicated			0
the company is taking appropriate measures to fix the problems , so i do n't think this will cause significant damage to @entity2 's reputation			0
' but critics say @entity2 's image as a producer of high quality cars has nevertheless been dented once again .			0
