@entity0 drew first blood in the new @entity2 by grinding out an 18 - 12 win over @entity4 in an action - packed clash in front of a 13,080 crowd at the @entity9			1
it was a full - blooded encounter in which the @entity12 club incurred the wrath of the partisan crowd with two ugly high tackles that might well have produced red cards in @entity17			0
the @entity4 battled throughout without being anywhere near their best but had no real answer to the craft of the @entity0 ' @entity22 half - back pairing of @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity26 celebrates after scoring the opening try for @entity0 in their 18 - 12 win over @entity4 @entity30 of @entity4 ( centre ) bursts through the tackles of the @entity34 defence the @entity4 were dealt a blow before kick - off when @entity38 utility man @entity37 was ruled out with a shoulder injury but @entity40 proved a superb replacement at full - back and @entity43 slotted in at centre for his full debut			1
the visitors made the best possible start , making the most of an early knock - on by former player @entity49 as @entity51 international second rower @entity26 took a short pass from @entity25 to go in for the first try with just 80 seconds on the clock			0
@entity24 added the goal to make it 6 - 0 but @entity4 's response was impressive and the @entity0 were indebted to debutant winger @entity58 for a trysaving tackle on home skipper @entity60			2
@entity61 ( centre ) attempts to escape the grasps of @entity64 and @entity30 at the @entity65 @entity49 ( left ) looks to get past @entity66 of @entity34 during his side 's second half defeat second rower @entity70 was then held up over the line before @entity72 brought @entity4 level after dummying his way past @entity25 and full - back @entity75 to score a superb solo try , to which he added the goal			1
the kicking game of @entity24 and @entity25 always threatened to cause problems for @entity4 's defence and , when @entity60 failed to clear the former 's grubber on the last tackle , second rower @entity80 pounced to score a second try and regain the lead			2
referee @entity90 seemed determined to let the game flow but he was forced to blow up for a horrible - looking tackle by @entity58 on @entity93 and @entity4 took advantage of the first penalty of the match to score their second try on 29 minutes , centre @entity99 taking @entity43 's pass to cross at the corner			2
@entity4 also had a claim for a penalty try ruled out as they trailed 12 - 10 at the break and they almost fell further behind early in the second half when @entity75 breached their line only to be held up on his back			0
@entity40 ( centre ) is double teamed high by @entity112 and match winner @entity75 tempers flared during the match after some high tackles took place much to the anger of the players a string of errors forced the @entity4 onto the defensive for much of the third quarter but some robust work from forwards @entity30 and @entity126 rallied their side and they drew level with a penalty from @entity72 on 58 minutes			1
that followed another ugly high shot , this time by @entity25 on @entity72 , and the penalties began to pile up as the @entity135 side 's discipline started to let them down			0
however , just as @entity4 appeared to be getting on top , they crucially conceded a try against the run of play			0
@entity142 @entity141 split them down the middle and , after @entity145 was only able to parry @entity25 's kick , @entity75 was on hand to gather the ball and touch down for the @entity0 ' third try			0
@entity75 ( right ) celebrates @entity0 victory against @entity4 with @entity151 the @entity34 players congratulate each other after winning their opening @entity2 game @entity24 kicked his third goal to wrap up the scoring , although @entity60 had a late chance to earn a possible share of the spoils before spilling a difficult pass from @entity162 .			1
