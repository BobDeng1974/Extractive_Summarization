these are professionals we should be able to trust			2
' we leave ourselves wholly open , especially if we are in pain			2
it is in these circumstances that this defendant sexually assaulted the complainant			0

' she explained the woman had gone to @entity50 , in @entity51 , on july 9 last year , to receive the results of a scan			1
her usual doctor was not there and she was seen instead by 40 - year - old orthopaedic surgeon @entity2 , with a nurse ' chaperone ' present			1
the scans had apparently not shown anything to explain her back and leg pain and a full report had not been completed , and the patient left upset and angry			1

' he was saying : " do n’t get so upset			0
i ’m sure we ’ll be able to do something " , ' she told police in an interview played to the court			1
' i thought it was really nice of him to try to calm me down and cheer me up			0

he quickly went to his car to drop something off , before returning			2
with her sitting in the driver ’s seat , he got into the passenger seat and began feeling the areas she said were painful			0
patient : the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , had gone to @entity50 , in @entity51 , on july 9 last year , to receive the results of a scan she said he asked her to put her seat back and continuously told her to relax , as the ' examination ' went further			1
' i should not have done it but he was a doctor			0
i trusted him , ' she told police			1
' i felt really weird and awkward about it but i thought because he ’s a doctor there is n’t anything to worry about			0
' i noticed he kept looking towards the hospital and i realised			0
i said : " i ’m just going to wait for the scan result "			0
' he said : " are you sure ? " and i said : " yes , please can you leave my car ? ” ' she told the police @entity2 then stood by her car , still talking to her			1
' it was wrong , the way he was looking at me , ' she said			0
the interviewing officer then asked : ' how would you say he was looking at you ? ' ' like a pervert , ' said the woman			1

under cross-examination the woman victim insisted that the account she had given was correct			2
' i felt really weird and awkward about it but i thought because he ’s a doctor there is n’t anything to worry about ' woman patient @entity170 , for the defence , said : ' i do n't deny , that because you were still very upset , he said he would sit in your car and talk to you			1
' ' i do n't think so , ' said the complainant			0
mr @entity175 asked : ' well , how did he get in your car then ? ' she replied : " he said he needed to check something and i needed to straighten my leg			2
' the defence put to her that there was no need to examine her further or ask any of the questions she alleged were put , as it had already been covered during the hospital appointment			0
mr @entity175 also suggested the layout of her small car would have made what she had alleged impractical			2
he asked whether a later appointment had been brought forward by the hospital following her complaint , which she said had happened			0
judge @entity197 then asked her : ' did you make a complaint in the hope you would get seen sooner ? ' she answered : ' definitely not			0
i just wanted to make sure it did n't happen to anyone else			0
' it could have been your family , your daughter , sister			0
he 's meant to be a doctor and not touch you the way he touched me and not in my car			2
