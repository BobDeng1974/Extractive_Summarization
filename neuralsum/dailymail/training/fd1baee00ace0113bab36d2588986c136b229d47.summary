from a curved design to faster processors , @entity0 has been teasing upcoming features of its next @entity5 phone for weeks			1
and now the @entity7 firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built - in			1
many current phones need specially - designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly , but @entity0 's next - generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip			1
with our upcoming @entity5 smartphones , users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before			1
' a @entity0 phone using a charging plate is used to illustrate the technology in a blog post by @entity31 , principal engineer in @entity0 ' it and mobile division wrote : ' 2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging			1
' with our upcoming @entity5 smartphones , users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before			1
' the use of the plural ' smartphones ' adds further weight to the fact @entity0 will unveil at least two handsets at this year 's @entity43 in @entity44 in march			1
previous leaks said the @entity46 will feature a @entity48 5.5 - inch display			2
other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches			0
it is expected to have an octa - core processor and @entity55 rear - facing camera			0
more recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an edge version of its flagship phone			0
the @entity60 is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides			2
the @entity7 giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival @entity66			0
and the curved screen has already been used in @entity0 's @entity67			2
however , the @entity60 will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode			2
the use of the plural ' smartphones ' in @entity0 's latest blog post adds weight to these claims			1
elsewhere , this post heavily implies the devices will have wireless charging built in			1
both handsets are expected to be unveiled at @entity43 on 1 march			1
these are expected to be the @entity80 , and the @entity60 that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides			1
both phones are also expected to have all - metal bodies , in a move away from @entity0 's current plastic range , and 5.1 - inch screens			1
the @entity7 giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival @entity66			0
and the curved screen has already been used in @entity0 's @entity90			2
however , the @entity60 will have the ability to work in a left or right - handed mode users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them			1
until now , many phones and other products have predominantly used the ' magnetic - inductive ' method of charging			0
this involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers			0
there are three wireless charging organisations including the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) , and its @entity112 standard , the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) and the @entity114 ( @entity115 )			1
@entity0 is a member of all three groups			2
this means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use , and not every standard is supported across different charging points , for example			0
however , last year , components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in january , the @entity113 and @entity115 announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features			1
the @entity46 wo n't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the @entity132 already offers this feature - but the @entity132 runs on the @entity112 standard			1
the use of the plural ' smartphones ' in the blog post adds further weight to the fact @entity0 will unveil at least two handsets at this year 's @entity43 in @entity44 in march			1
@entity0 's invite ( pictured ) hints at a curved device and the firm is expected to announced the @entity46 and @entity60 both phones are expected to have all - metal bodies , in a move away from @entity0 's current plastic range , and 5.1 - inch screens			1

and the curved screen has already been used in @entity0 's @entity67 ( pictured ) @entity0 's next @entity5 phones are , however , expected to be the first to support multiple standards on a built - in chip			1
this means they will be more versatile to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as @entity162 and @entity163			0
it will also beat main rival @entity66 to introducing the technology			0

blog post said : ' with our upcoming @entity5 smartphones , users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before '
it *explains* how 2015 is set to be a ' landmark year ' for wireless charging
the *majority* of wireless charging is currently done using accessories
these include cases and clips fitted with different types of charging chips
developments mean multiple types can now be added to the same chip
and @entity0 is expected to introduce this chip into its @entity46 and @entity60
both handsets are expected to be unveiled in @entity44 in march
