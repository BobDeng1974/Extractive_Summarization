by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 19 july 2012 the @entity1 has granted @entity2 a patent for what is believed to be the new dock connector on the next @entity6			1
@entity2 is believed to be revamping the charging port for what will be the fifth version of the @entity6 , which is expected to arrive later this @entity10			1
as with all of @entity2 's products , the company keeps its cards very close to its chest before launches , but the patent filing describes a charging and data port which matches the rumoured new design			2
sadly for @entity2 users , the new design will mean changing all of your peripherals , such as speaker docks , unless adapters comes to market			2
change : this picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new @entity6 ( right ) , with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete @entity32 and new : the current @entity6 is shown with the prototype of the @entity6 's outer casing earlier this week @entity35 printed these images of what they claim is the fascia of the next @entity6 , suggesting the screen is much larger the new port looks similar to micro usb , the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however it is very unlikely that @entity2 will support this standard , despite moves by the @entity47 to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable			1
@entity2 's version has a triangle - shaped wedge at one end , which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round			1
@entity59 fans may spot a superficial similarity to a @entity62 port , which is used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed			2
the patent office granted the patent for : ' a power adapter for a peripheral device such as portable electronics device			0
' the power adapter includes a housing that contains electrical components associated with the power adapter			0
' the power adapter also includes a data port provided at a surface of the housing			0
the data port is configured to provide external power to the peripheral device			0
' popular : but @entity6 users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device the rumoured proposal has sparked alarm among the company ’s followers who fear they will have to buy new equipment to work with the phone			1
docking stations , which play music stored on iphones and can cost hundreds of pounds , may become redundant as will chargers			0
all iphones made so far use a 30 - pin connector both for power and to plug in accessories			1
useless : the $ 850 @entity96 8 is designed to work with the current @entity6 's design obsolete : the @entity99 speaker , left , and the @entity100 10 , right , are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the @entity6 @entity2 advertised for staff to work on the new connector earlier this year			1
it was seeking an engineer ‘ responsible for identifying appropriate connection technology requirements for new products and follow through with selection and development of suitable interconnect products ’			0
the advertisement added : ‘ this will often involve adaptation of existing connectors or complete new designs			0
’ the new model is expected to have a larger 4 - inch screen that will reputedly offer better resolution viewing than a high definition tv			2
it will include @entity2 ’s new mapping software , which has sparked privacy fears as it uses aerial photography capable of showing detail just four inches across .			0

@entity6 will use a 19 - pin connector instead of 30 - pin , according to reports
however change means all current @entity6 accessories must be *replaced*
new connector could allow phone to be *thinner* and enable *magnetic* cable
