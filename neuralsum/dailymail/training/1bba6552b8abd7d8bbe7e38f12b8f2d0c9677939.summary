by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:33 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:34 est , 23 december 2013 cleared : detective constable @entity3 was acquitted of administering a poison or noxious substance with intent at @entity7 a policeman who filled a @entity10 bottle with screenwash as a practical joke - only for it to be drunk by an unsuspecting colleague - has been cleared of poisoning him			1
detective constable @entity3 , who works in the @entity15 division of the @entity16 , said he was ' fed up ' with his drink getting stolen from a communal fridge			1
so , in what he later described as ' a poorly - planed practical joke ' , he filled up a 500ml bottle of the berry and tropical - flavoured drink with screenwash , hoping to identify the culprit and ' teach him a lesson '			1
but his colleague , dc @entity27 , who also drank @entity10 and stored it in the same fridge , accidentally drank from the bottle of screenwash			1
after swallowing two mouthfuls of the drink , he felt a burning pain in his throat and vomited several times			1
@entity36 was advised to go to hospital but luckily he was not seriously hurt after drinking the toxic liquid on 29 january last year			0
@entity3 was arrested and charged for attempting to poison his colleague with intent			2
but he insisted that his sole intention was to catch the thief , and not to cause any harm , which led to him being cleared of the charge today at @entity7			2
he had originally admitted the office , but changed his plea and managed to convince a jury of seven men and five women that he is an innocent man			0
wearing a dark jacket over a white casual shirt , @entity3 , smiled to relatives in the public gallery when the verdict was announced			2
the court heard that @entity3 bought the @entity10 while he was training for a half - marathon			1
the pair were based at police offices in @entity59 , @entity60 , but did not know each other , said prosecutor @entity62			0
he said : ‘ the defendant replaced the blue @entity10 drink in a sports - style drinking bottle with screenwash and put it back in the communal fridge in the office he worked			1
‘ he says his motive in doing so was the belief the drink was his , and that the person who had been stealing his drinks would be taught a lesson			0
‘ in fact , his colleague , @entity27 , had the misfortune also to be a drinker of @entity10 , and to have stored his own @entity10 drinks in the fridge			1
victim : @entity28 @entity27 , left , was also a @entity10 drinker who used the communal fridge , and accidentally drank from the screenwash bottle , which caused burning pain and vomiting ‘ when he drank from the @entity10 in question , he swallowed a mouthful or two of screenwash before experienced the very unpleasant consequences			1
’ ms @entity62 added : ‘ whether this drink was in fact @entity36 ’s , or whether he thought it was , or even if he was stealing @entity94 ’s drink is irrelevant			0
‘ this was a dangerous and completely disproportionate thing to do in the circumstances			0
‘ by deliberately disguising the blue screen wash in a @entity10 bottle and placing it , unlabelled , in the communal fridge , the defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have forseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose			1
’ @entity3 , from @entity105 , @entity106 , claimed there was a ‘ culture of humour ’ at his office where officers would play pranks on each other			2
he said colleagues were aware of the @entity10 being spiked with screen wash , and had suggested alternatives including @entity117 and even urine			2
ms @entity62 said this was merely quigley ‘ trying to deflect attention from his own wrong doing			0
’ in a prepared statement he said : ‘ i admit fully and accept all culpability for my actions			0
‘ i am extremely sorry and deeply remorseful for what has happened			0
it was never my intention to cause any injury to anyone			0
‘ however , i do accept that my actions were likely to cause grievance or annoyance			0

detective constable @entity3 was ' fed up ' with *people* taking his drink
so he filled a bottle with screenwash in ' a poorly - planned practical joke '
@entity28 @entity27 , also a @entity10 drinker , took the bottle by accident
he experienced burning pain and vomiting , but was not seriously hurt
but @entity3 was cleared today after a jury accepted he had meant no harm
