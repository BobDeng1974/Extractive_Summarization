@entity0 is touring the country hoping to show how @entity2 can cope without @entity3			1
but the @entity6 leader 's campaign came to an embarrassing halt when on a tour of a hinge factory he met an @entity11 worker who spoke no @entity12			1
after an awkward exchange with @entity14 at the plant in @entity16 , mr @entity0 was quick to insist he did not want to send @entity18 migrants home to stop them taking the jobs of young @entity2			1
he wants an @entity32 - style system to set targets for the level of skills needed for someone to come to @entity2 in search of work			2
at present no limits can be put on workers from elsewhere in the @entity18 under freedom of information rules			2
mr @entity0 today visited hinge manufacturer @entity43 in @entity45 , @entity16 to promote his party 's election policies			1
he was campaigning with @entity6 mp @entity48 ( left ) who hopes to hold the seat he won after defecting from the @entity50 last year after meeting several workers , he struggled to make small talk when he met 62 - year - old @entity11 mr @entity14			1
he has lived in @entity53 for five years after travelling to the @entity2 for work , but could not answer any of mr @entity0 's questions as he does not speak any @entity12			1
his colleagues described him as ' relatively low - skilled '			0
mr @entity0 has previously railed against the number of people from elsewhere in @entity3 working in the @entity2			1
last year he said : ' when you boil it down to @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity11 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , over a million of their workers are in @entity2 and only 42,000 @entity2 citizens are working in those countries			2
' mr @entity0 was campaigning with @entity6 mp @entity48 ( left ) who hopes to hold the seat he won after defecting from the @entity50 last year but today he insisted he would not want to send mr @entity14 back to @entity11			1
' @entity6 has never said anyone should leave the country , so the question is entirely baseless , ' he told reporters			0
' one of the big problems that we 've got in engineering is a real shortage of young people studying engineering to go into trades such as this , which is regrettable			0
' we 've got rid of technical colleges and encouraged more and more young people to go to university and study degrees which are not directly linked to industry such as this			0
' if there 's no @entity2 person trained to do that job , then that says more about us than them			0
' @entity43 's manufacturing manager , @entity97 , said that the firm needed to look to @entity3 to fill a skills gap and on occasion had flown potential employees from @entity64			0
mr @entity97 said he was not a @entity6 supporter but did not oppose the party 's proposal of an @entity32 - style points system designed to limit the number of immigrants			2
he said : ' there needs to be some controls but presumably , if we needed to fill a skills gap , we would still be able to do that under such a system			0
' the company employs 130 people , six of whom are migrants from @entity3			0
finance director @entity117 said : ' a lot of industries in the @entity2 do need migrant workers			0
' the area we 're in means we 've got a large pool to recruit from but sometimes we find their skills are limited			0
on those occasions we have had to look further afield , including flying interviewees in from @entity64			0
' mr @entity0 was quick to insist he did not want to send @entity18 migrants home to stop them taking the jobs of young @entity2 later mr @entity0 visited the town 's @entity131 with @entity48 - the first person to be elected as a @entity6 mp after defecting from the conservatives			1
he met supporters and again spoke of the lack of young @entity2 people pursuing careers in manufacturing and leaving engineering firms with a ' genuine shortage ' of skilled workers			2
he said : ' we will say that anyone doing engineering at degree level should not be paying any tuition fees			0
' in november , @entity6 's @entity148 suggested that @entity150 migrants would only be allowed to stay for a ' fixed period ' if @entity2 chose to leave the @entity18			1
mr @entity0 later insisted there had been ' confusion ' and insisted @entity6 respected the ' rule of law and @entity2 justice ' .			1

@entity6 leader lost for words as he met @entity14 at the plant in @entity16
struggled for small talk because mr @entity14 speaks little @entity12
@entity0 insisted he did not want to *deport* migrants if @entity2 left the @entity18
