the former @entity12 president is recovering in hospital after having an operation to remove gallstones , and a presidential spokesman said he is ' looking much better '			1
the 94 - year - old , who was @entity12 's first black president , underwent the surgery at a private clinic in @entity6			1
president @entity20 said mr @entity2 needed ' extraordinary care ' because of his age , and added : ' if he spends more days in hospital , it is because that necessary care is being provided			1

@entity12 have been worried about mr @entity2 's health since he was airlifted to the clinic from his home in @entity40 in the @entity41			1
while in hospital , tests revealed the presence of gallstones and it was decided the operation would be carried out after he had recovered			1

' he has come to accept that it 's part of growing old , and it 's part of humanity as such ' , she said			0
' at some point you will dependent on someone else , he has come to embrace it '			0
the pair 's comments were the first official remarks by his family since the former president was rushed to hospital			1

his ongoing hospitalisation has caused growing concern in @entity12 , a nation of 50 million people that largely reveres him for being the nation 's first democratically elected president who sought to bring the country together after centuries of racial division			1
tests at 1 @entity123 near @entity12 's capital , @entity6 , detected the lung infection , presidential spokesman mr @entity30 previously said in a statement			1
public concern : broadcast vans parked near the 1 @entity123 where @entity12 's former president @entity2 is hospitalised security : @entity12 military police officers check cars entering the 1 @entity123 ' @entity2 is receiving appropriate treatment and he is responding to the treatment , ' @entity30 said , referring to mr @entity2 by his clan name as many do in @entity12 as a sign of affection			1

the chaos that followed his stay at that public hospital , with journalists and members of the public surrounding it and entering wards , saw the @entity12 military take charge of his care and the government control the information about his health			1

rallying round : worshippers pray at the @entity180 in @entity181			0
calls for prayer have been made for former president @entity2 bated breath : the nation has been eagerly awaiting news of his condition she added : ' it is important to keep him in our prayers and also to be as calm as possible and not cause a state of panic because i think that is not what all of us need			2
' mr @entity2 has a history with lung problems			2
he fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail - end of his prison years , after he had been moved from the notorious @entity202 and to another jail to ease the apartheid government 's efforts to negotiate with him about a possible release			2

‘ with a hint of annoyance , ( the doctor ) said , “ @entity2 , take a look at your chest , ” ’ mr @entity2 recounted			0
‘ he pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger than the other			0
’ surgeons immediately cut into his chest and removed two litres ( half a gallon ) of liquid from his lungs , which tested positive for tuberculosis			0
doctors at the time suggested mr @entity2 contracted the disease from his damp prison cell			2
about 1.4 million people worldwide die each year from tuberculosis , a bacterial infection which can stay dormant for years			1
it also can cause permanent lung damage , though in his autobiography mr @entity2 says doctors caught it in time			1
