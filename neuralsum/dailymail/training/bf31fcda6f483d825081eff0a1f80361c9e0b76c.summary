by @entity0 double @entity2 champion @entity1 refuses to go to war with her @entity5 team - mates despite being pitted against each other at the @entity7			1
@entity8 won team pursuit gold at @entity10 in a world - record time alongside @entity12 and @entity13 , but all three will be lining up for @entity15 in the individual pursuit in @entity17 on friday			1
they will also be up against their @entity19 colleagues @entity20 and @entity21 , who ride for @entity22 and @entity23 respectively			1
focused : @entity8 will not go to war with her @entity19 team - mates despite going head - to - head in @entity17 determined : @entity8 tasted success at @entity10 when she won gold in the team pursuit that promises to lend an interesting dynamic to the competition , but @entity8 has no intention of adding any extra edge despite a late change in preparation			1
' our coach has this red book where he jots down all our times and he 's decided that he 's showing us one by one now so that we ca n't see how other people have done , ' revealed @entity8			2
' i 'm like ' this is all getting a bit serious '			0
i just want to see what people are doing			0
' it 's so weird , because we were n't doing that the previous week and after this week we 'll be team - mates again			2
' @entity8 explained that the rather unusual @entity52 outfit for the opening ceremony - an eye - catching and unconventional affair - had been expected to cause @entity56 some grief , but she has taken a different approach			2
' i do n't think there 's many mind games between us but you get the odd comment every now again			0
i read the other day that the @entity23 opening and closing outfits were made to create war because we 're going to be like ' oh they look horrible ' or whatever			0
rivals : @entity8 will face @entity56 , left , and @entity20 , who are representing @entity23 and @entity22 respectively ' so with @entity21 i 've been saying , ' oh it looks amazing '			1
she 's like ' do i look amazing or do n't i ? she ca n't tell whether i 'm lying , but it 's certainly not war for me			0
' @entity13 , who won individual pursuit gold at @entity75 in @entity76 this year and will be chasing another success in @entity17 , is keen not to sidetracked into seeing the event as a straight shootout between the home nations riders			1
the 25 - year - old , who is looking forward to wearing @entity83 colours for purely aesthetic reasons , expects a fierce challenge for the podium from all angles			2
' it 's much easier to have your nails painted with an @entity15 flag rather than a @entity5 one , that will make life easier , " ' she said			0
close : @entity8 in action for @entity19 alongside @entity56 , @entity12 and @entity20 at the @entity94 ' but it is quite a different atmosphere here because we are all doing our own thing and you do want to know what your rivals are doing			1
but they are n't my only rivals because you have the other girls from @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 who are all really strong nations in women 's endurance cycling			0
' i do n't tend to worry about other people 's times , just as long as my times are quicker than a couple of weeks ago then that 's fine			0
