these two screen grabs show you just how hard man - marking is — and how bad @entity3 were at it for @entity6 ’s goal			1
in the first image , all the @entity8 players are picked up			1
a split second later and @entity6 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are all unmarked			2
unless you are physically holding somebody — as @entity3 did earlier in the game — it is impossible to man - mark someone from a setpiece			0
the attacker has the advantage and if you switch off for a moment , you are in trouble			2
that ’s why i favour zonal marking			2
@entity8 's major aerial threats are marked before their corner ahead of the opening goal on sunday but as the ball comes in , @entity8 's aerial threats are all in open space and @entity6 scores and having 5ft 8in @entity34 marking 6ft 2in @entity6 is criminal			1
@entity35 says @entity36 is to blame as he was supposed to be marking him but the players should be in no doubt			0
ironically , it was the man who was supposed to be marking the space who is most to blame for the goal			0
@entity45 ’s position is far too deep , he should be nearer the six - yard line , ready to attack the ball			1
instead , when it comes in , he melts away towards the goal - line rather than attacking the ball			0
at @entity52 we used to put @entity53 in that area as it would take an incredible ball to get past him			0
@entity3 might have to rethink positioning @entity57 there			0
@entity6 jumps high above @entity34 to head the ball towards goal and score the opener for @entity8 @entity6 ( centre ) wheels away to celebrate as @entity45 ( left ) looks dejected in the background @entity3 manager @entity35 ( left ) has his notes in hand during the @entity69 clash			1

@entity6 's header gave @entity8 the lead in the 53rd minute
having @entity34 marking @entity6 for the corner was criminal
@entity45 's position is far too deep and @entity8 took advantage
