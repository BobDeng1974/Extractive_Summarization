the skies finally broke halfway through his match on monday , forcing @entity3 back to the locker room for a shower and a change of kit			1
only after doing that could he step outside into the corridor and speak to his coach @entity10 about how things were going in his fourth - round match against @entity15 giant @entity13			0
that , it turned out , was about the only inconvenience of the day as his @entity19 title defence continues to fall into place			0
everything else is going swimmingly after a superbly skilled 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 victory over the world no 18			1
it was , for the first time in this tournament , a proper test both without the roof and under it , with a useful taste of tension thrown in as @entity13 forced a set point before the tiebreak was clinched 8 - 6			1
@entity3 ’s day could only have been improved had his next obstacle , the exciting young @entity54 @entity53 , had his fourth - round tie held over by largely unexpected rain that has created havoc with the schedule			1
it was not , and now @entity19 has the quarter - final tomorrow it had eagerly hoped for : the defending champion in sublime form against the hugely - gifted 23 - year - old , long identified as the man who can break up the @entity66 ’s domination			1
on the move : @entity3 's bid to reach defend his @entity19 title is still on course after a simple win net gains : @entity13 comes forward as he tries to beat @entity3 on monday deft touch : @entity3 looked in superb form as he battled past @entity13 on monday rising star : @entity3 will play @entity76 's boyfriend @entity53 in the quarter - finals @entity3 has not dropped a set so far in the tournament but he will be severely tested against talented @entity53 in wednesday 's quarter - final			1
@entity82 @entity81 ( @entity83 ) 6 - 1 6 - 4 7 - @entity85 @entity84 ( @entity86 ) 6 - 1 6 - 1 6 - @entity89 @entity88 ( @entity90 ) 6 - 2 6 - 3 6 - @entity87 @entity13 ( @entity15 ) 6 - 4 6 - 3 7 - 6p.s			1
so far it ’s ... @entity93 @entity92 @entity3 looks in no state to cede his place at the top table , but is aware of the threat he faces : ‘ he ’s starting to come into his prime , he ’s won a lot of matches this year , ’ said the third seed , who came close to employing the @entity54 ’s coach , @entity96 , before appointing @entity97 at the end of 2011			1
‘ @entity53 ’s a more mature player now and makes better decisions on the court than he used to			2
he has a lot of variety in his game and sometimes it takes time to know how to use that — he ’s starting to do it now			0
” yesterday ’s match became tougher after the roof was closed at 3 - 0 in the second set , although @entity3 was not complaining about it not being shut from the start			1
‘ they should always try to play first with it open because this is an outdoor event			0
i started off a bit tentative when we came back out and he hit the ball cleaner but i still did well and created loads of chances			0
’ if it is the first wednesday of july then it must be @entity3 in the @entity19 quarter - finals , as this is his seventh consecutive progression to the last eight , emblematic of his admirable consistency at the @entity133			1
rivals such as @entity135 and @entity136 face back - to - back matches starting today , while @entity139 champion @entity138 has the prospect of three straight days in action if he is to survive			2
not for @entity3 the hiatus caused by saturday ’s five hours of rain or the absurdity , in @entity138 ’s case , of being held back then for ‘ security ’ reasons			2
@entity19 : day seven roundup high flyer : @entity3 made quick work of @entity13 despite the rain delay giant effort : but 6ft 8in @entity13 could not live with @entity3 on @entity153 famous fan : sir @entity36 stands to applaud @entity3 during his match with @entity13 hello sirs ! sir @entity36 ( left ) and sir @entity156 ( right ) were in the royal box watching @entity3 taking cover : @entity3 's girlfriend @entity34 tries to avoid the rain which disrupted play on monday @entity3 's @entity161 : @entity19 champion hits perfect drop shot @entity3 need not worry about the other half of the draw , and had his hands full enough yesterday with a player whose all - round game , and remarkable movement for a very tall man showed that he is far more than a one - trick pony			1
as the champion alluded , if there was a blemish on this fine performance it was what happened when he stepped back out at 3 - 0 and found himself confronted with a far more assertive opponent who started approaching the net with confidence			2
it is possible to read too much into that passage , but you would have to say the restart reflected better on @entity13 ’s coach , ex-journeyman player @entity185 , than it did on @entity10 in her and @entity3 ’s first such situation together			2
@entity13 ( left ) went out re-energised with a new battle plan while @entity3 suddenly looked unnerved			2
he was broken immediately and forced to cling on to the one remaining break he had already fashioned			0
we saw , for the first time this fortnight , the champion struggling to contain his frustration and berating himself , and it took him around four games to restore order against an inspired opponent			0
a penny for the thoughts of @entity36 , veteran of so many half - time team talks , on that			2
the two , who text each other every so often , spoke briefly afterwards : ‘ not technical things or tactical things , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ more mental things , how you respond to tough situations			0
obviously you are going to listen to someone like him			0
’ two figures show just how authoritative , overall , his game was against a powerful opponent with a potent serve who did not give him a single double fault			0
mum 's the word : @entity218 takes her seat to watch her son @entity220 try to make the quarter finals watching brief : @entity10 watches her new charge @entity3 on @entity153 there were 19 break points created over the three sets , and 73 per cent of the serves boomed down from the @entity15 ’s end were returned in			1
@entity3 ’ s anticipation was extraordinary , combined with lightning quick hands that continually saw him block the ball back			0
he might have finished it earlier but then held his nerve in the tiebreak when 5 - 3 turned to 5 - 6			1
a service winner saved that set point and a cross court backhand was to seal it			0
he has looked supremely sharp until now and , whatever may have happened after the restart , @entity10 deserves credit for that state of affairs .			0

@entity243 no 1 and defending champion won 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 )
host of *celebrities* *including* sir @entity36 and @entity248 watched win
rain had earlier interrupted play during second set for *27* minutes
@entity3 will now face @entity53 in the @entity255 quarter - finals
@entity3 hoping to be first @entity243 man to defend title since @entity259 in 1936
