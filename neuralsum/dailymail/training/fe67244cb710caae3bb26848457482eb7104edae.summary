’ he said he was worried that @entity3 could use the same subversive techniques which they used to annex @entity41 in the @entity5 , including @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
he added : ‘ it is a very real and present danger , he ( mr @entity10 ) has been testing @entity1 all last year			1

we had to scramble the jets very quickly to see them off			0

the secretary of state said : ‘ we do n’t want a war with @entity3			2
’ but asked if we could defeat @entity3 if there was a war , he said : ‘ @entity1 has to be ready for any kind of aggression with @entity3 whatever form it takes			0
’ @entity110 have accused @entity3 of violating a ceasefire agreed between the @entity3 and @entity70 leaders last week as fighting has raged around the key strategic rail hub of @entity77			0
@entity115 , the @entity110 ambassador to the @entity116 , said it was ‘ ironic to say the least ’ that @entity3 had produced the motion at the same time as it was ‘ backing an all - out assault ’ in @entity70			0
a @entity70 military spokesman said the rebels had launched five artillery strikes on @entity77 overnight , ‘ grossly violating the peace accords			0
’ referring to ‘ @entity124 ’ , a ceasefire agreement made between @entity3 and the @entity70 in september which failed , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m worried about @entity10 , @entity124 2 looks to be like @entity124 1			1
‘ there ’s no effective control of the border			0
i ’m worried about his pressure on the @entity5 , the way he is testing @entity1 – the submarines and the aircraft			0
’ he said if the peace deal collapsed , then @entity15 will renew its economic sanctions against @entity3 and review the ‘ non-lethal ’ equipment the country has been supplying to the @entity70			2
mr @entity0 said they were keeping a decision to arm the @entity70 ‘ under review ’ – but feared it could risk escalating the conflict			1
conflict : @entity115 ( pictured ) , the @entity110 ambassador to the @entity116 , said it was ‘ ironic to say the least ’ that @entity3 had produced a ceasefire motion at the same time as it was ‘ backing an all - out assault ’ in @entity70 asked if @entity15 was facing another @entity16 , he said : ‘ it looks pretty warm to me and it ’s warming up			2
‘ you have tanks and armour rolling across the @entity70 border and you have an @entity9 border guard who has been captured and not yet returned			0
‘ you have jets being flown up the @entity49 and you have submarines in the north sea - it looks to me like it 's warming up			0
’ he said he was ‘ outraged ’ by @entity3 flying @entity166 south of @entity167 a few weeks ago , adding : ‘ it is the first time since the height of the @entity16 that has happened and it just shows you , you need to respond each time he does something like that			0
’ ‘ people are more worried about the defence of the @entity15 than they have ( been ) for a long time ’ , he said , saying it would be ‘ foolhardy ’ to get rid of @entity169 at a time of heightened tensions			1
asked if there was a danger the @entity15 was going back to a nuclear arms race with @entity3 , he added : ‘ we are not investing in a new type of @entity169 , we are simply replacing the submarines that are coming to the end of their life with four new ones			1
’ @entity185 : mr @entity0 said it would be ' foolhardy ' to get rid of @entity169 at a time of heightened tensions but he said mr @entity10 ’s activity underlined the need for @entity169 , adding : ‘ they are modernising their nuclear forces and we need to modernise our submarines			1
’ he said it was ‘ important ’ that @entity15 had secured the 2 per cent spending of gdp on defence last year – but refused to say whether the 2 per cent @entity1 target would be hit following the election			1
he also stressed the importance of the building up of a 5,000 - strong @entity1 high readiness task force by 2017			0
it will be led by 1,000 @entity15 personnel who would be ready to be respond to @entity3 aggression within 48 hours and troops will be stationed in eight different locations across @entity33			1
