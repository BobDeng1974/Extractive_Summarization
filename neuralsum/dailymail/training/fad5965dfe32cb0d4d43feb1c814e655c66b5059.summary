@entity0 was dressed up for the coronation of @entity2			1
@entity4 ’s @entity3 whooped as the starlet entered stage left clasping a bouquet of flowers , smiling warmly at her adoring fans			2
even @entity10 played their part , dispatching princess @entity2 , the @entity13 starlet ’s namesake , to sit just feet behind the baseline in the front row of the @entity16			1
the unwilling participant in this production was @entity19 , who destroyed a helpless @entity2 in a 55 - minute exhibition of terrifyingly good tennis it was the shortest women ’s final since 1983 when another @entity24 , @entity25 , took 54 minutes to beat @entity26 , an @entity27 who has since become a nun			1
’ but she was no match for @entity19 , who was imperious in winning her second @entity33 title			1
the world no 6 greeted victory by shutting her eyes momentarily , raising both arms towards her player ’s box and laying flat on the lawn			2
@entity19 ’s ascent to the box to celebrate with her team was as straightforward as her victory , facilitated by the introduction of a ‘ safety gate ’ , which has removed the iconic scramble over the commentary box and into the stands			1
the emotion of the moment was not diminished for @entity19 or her father @entity85 who was in floods of tears as he was when she beat @entity88 to win her only other @entity64 title here in 2011			1
‘ he cries a lot actually , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ it ’s nothing new , nothing special			2
actually i think everyone was crying in my box , he was n’t only one			2
i was crying , as well			2
i get that from my dad			2
‘ he has a birthday tomorrow , so i ’m just glad that he has a nice present			0
’ unfortunate : @entity2 had no answers to @entity19 on @entity0 in two sets happy moment : @entity19 made it up into the stands to celebrate with a member of her support focused : @entity19 was desperate to land her second @entity33 title easy : @entity19 won the first set 6 - 3 on @entity0 on saturday , with the roof open when she woke on saturday morning , the 24 - year - old was greeted by the word ‘ bojd ’ - a @entity24 term meaning ‘ come on ' - which her coach @entity115 spelled out in kitchen roll on the front garden of the house she is staying at in @entity33			1
the pair remained a professional partnership even as @entity19 struggled to recapture the promise she showed three years ago			1
his charge did not require much encouragement yesterday			0
she broke @entity2 ’s serve six times and won seven consecutive games to triumph 6 - 3 , 6 - 0			1
using her backhand as a tranquiliser dart and her forehand to deliver the fatal blow , @entity19 zapped the belief of the talented 20 - year - old			1
even @entity19 ’s movement , normally considered the weak point of her game , was superb as she chased down balls even she did n’t expect to reach			1
‘ i think maybe it was magic , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ a few shots were really incredible and i could n’t believe i was getting there and then playing such an amazing shot back			0
i said to myself “ @entity144 this is good			0
i can really run and get everything back			0
” ‘ this means maybe more than 2011 because i really played a great tournament here			2
i was ready for every match and i think that i ’m more prepared to handle the pressure			2
’ pressure : 20 - year - old @entity2 was playing in her first ever @entity64 final hitting winners : @entity19 was far too strong for the youngster in the first set potential : this may not have been @entity2 's year , but many are tipping her to win a @entity64 soon dominant : the @entity24 star celebrates after winning a point in the first set the majority of the attention before the match had been focused on @entity2 , earmarked as ‘ the next @entity88 ’ and who could potentially rival the @entity163 in both major titles and off - court earnings			1
she did not suffer a fit of nerves and even broke @entity19 once in the first set but she admitted to being outplayed			1
‘ i think it ’s a tough road to try to become as good as i want to be , ’ she said , ‘ i ’m not going to win every single time			0
i think this was a good experience for me , my first @entity64 final			1
‘ it was a big moment walking out onto @entity0 for a final			1
you know , i have that experience now			0
i know what it feels like			0
we were holding flowers instead of our tennis bags			0
i just felt so grateful to be able to walk out on a stage and , you know , have a chance to perform and do what i love			0
it was nice to have princess @entity2 there , i ’m just sorry i could n’t have put on a better show for her			1
’ the rain began to fall over @entity47 just as the final point was concluded			2
the roof was shut on @entity0 and the players were led into the bowels of the building as the lawn was prepared for the trophy presentation			1
@entity2 , who won junior @entity33 just two years ago , was led to the engraver ’s room			1
celebrity presence : @entity199 actor @entity198 sits beside @entity200 ( right ) on @entity0 looking smart : @entity201 in @entity202 sit in the @entity16 support : @entity2 was watched by her namesake , @entity2 ( pictured ) , at @entity33 today ‘ i was watching them work , wishing one day , dreaming that he ’ll write my name somewhere , ’ she said			1
‘ maybe it ’s a bit cruel but i did n’t ask questions			0
i was in there when i won the juniors			2
so i had flashbacks to that time			0
at that time i also got a picture with the men ’s doubles winners which included the @entity199 man @entity218			2
i think it ’s fascinating			0
‘ there are some old pictures on the wall			0
it ’s like nothing else			0
’ @entity2 , who will go into the top 10 in the world for the first time next week , will take home £ 880,000 in prize money and stands to earn much more in endorsement deals			1
but presently her mind is on her living room in @entity234			0
‘ i ’m just excited to spend a little time off , you know , with my family back home			0
‘ i ’m going to spend a lot of time on my couch			0
that ’s the first goal			0
i ’m going to allow myself to have my favourite dessert after dinner			0
’ for the winner , the @entity244 and for the loser , a chocolate brownie			0
sport can be cruel sometimes .			0
