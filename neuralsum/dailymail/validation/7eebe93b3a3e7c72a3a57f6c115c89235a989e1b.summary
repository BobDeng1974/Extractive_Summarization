the @entity0 has described the remarks of its own president @entity2 as ' very unfortunate ' , and insists its umpires ' ' integrity can not be questioned '			1
@entity2 put himself at the centre of a row over umpiring decisions which went the way of @entity9 in their @entity11 quarter - final victory over @entity12 in @entity13 on thursday			1
@entity9 opener @entity14 was reprieved as he neared his century when a no - ball was called because of the height of the delivery ; then @entity12 batsman @entity20 had to go when a marginal call came down in favour of boundary fielder @entity23 , whose foot was ruled to be just clear of the rope when he took a catch at fine - leg			1
@entity23 's catch of @entity12 's batsman @entity20 during their quarter final proved controversial @entity33 politician @entity2 's @entity0 role is largely ceremonial since cricket 's world governing body updated its constitution a year ago			1
he has nonetheless threatened to resign over the decisions taken by umpires @entity40 and @entity41 in the match which finished in a 109 - run win for @entity9			1
@entity2 implied the result was a foregone conclusion , and that world cricket is being run for the benefit of its superpower @entity9			1
' there was no quality in the umpiring			0
it looked like they took the field after it [ the outcome ] was pre-arranged , ' he said			0
' as the @entity0 president , whatever i have to say i will say it in next meeting			2
it could happen that maybe i will resign			0
there was doubt about whether the fielder had made contact with the boundary rope , but the decision stood ' i can not represent the " @entity68 "			0
if someone has imposed a result on us , in that case no one can accept it			0
' @entity0 chief executive @entity73 has responded with an emphatic dismissal of @entity2 's insinuations			2
he said : ' the @entity0 has noted mr @entity2 's comments , which are very unfortunate but made in his personal capacity			2
@entity14 was given a reprieve after being caught out off a no ball , and went on to make three figures ' as an @entity0 president , he should have been more considerate in his criticism of @entity0 match officials , whose integrity can not be questioned			2
' the no - ball decision was a 50 - 50 call			0
the spirit of the game dictates that the umpire 's decision is final and must be respected			0
' any suggestion that the match officials had ' an agenda ' or did anything other than perform to the best of their ability are baseless and are refuted in the strongest possible terms			0
' @entity2 ( right ) threatened to resign from the @entity0 over what he saw as unfair umpiring			1

@entity2 has threatened to resign after @entity12 lost to @entity9
@entity12 were on the *wrong* end of some controversial decisions
but @entity0 insists umpires ' ' integrity can not be questioned ' in @entity11
@entity9 will play @entity109 in @entity11 semi final on thursday
