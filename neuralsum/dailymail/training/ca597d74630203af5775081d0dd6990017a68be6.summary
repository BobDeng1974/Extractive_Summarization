he had previously denied the charge , claiming his daughter had died accidentally by falling out of bed			0
he changed his plea to guilty two days into his trial			0
@entity44 , 22 , the child 's mother , wept in court today as judge @entity47 told the court that baby @entity2 suffered considerably for hours before her eventual death			1
he said the circumstances ' demonstrated a callousness that is as incredible as it is inhuman '			0
he said : ' the murder of any human being is always a tragedy , the murder of a defenceless child of any age , the more so			2
' the murder of a helpless infant only a few weeks old in circumstances of brutality which almost defy belief is an appalling crime beyond comprehension			1
' he went on : ' this defendant has , albeit belatedly , accepted that he ca n't pretend with any chance at all that he can fool a jury that he did n't intend to cause harm to his daughter , when he gripped her , shook her aggressively , and threw her against a hard surface			0
this caused serious eye and brain injuries			0
' the responsibility - his alone - for so horrific a crime will , i imagine , weigh heavily upon his conscience for the rest of his life and so it should			1
the extent and nature of the injuries set out are clearly shocking			0
â€™ the court had previously heard how ms @entity44 , an agency worker , had returned to the house she shared with @entity0 to find their daughter dead in her cot			1
she rushed the youngster to hospital but doctors were unable to revive her			0
she was pronounced dead the same evening			0
defence lawyer @entity95 told the court that @entity0 had shown ' heartfelt ' remorse for what he had done to his own daughter			1
the @entity22 delivery driver , pictured left , carried out the murderous attack on the day the child 's mother @entity44 , 22 , pictured right , returned to work for the first time since giving birth the father , pictured here with ms @entity44 , left his child with a catalogue of shocking injuries , including a bite on her forehead , internal bleeding , head injuries , five fractured ribs and a lacerated liver she said : ' the horror of having realised that his child was badly hurt will never leave this young man			1
what he does recall is holding her			0
' he recalls she died in his arms and afterwards he was terrified as to the hurt he had inflicted on her and his girlfriend who he loved very much			0
he was in a state of utter terror and hurt			0
' she said the defendant was a ' loving and caring ' man who had suffered a ' clear mental disturbance '			2
at the time of the murder he was struggling to find work and ' matters were really at quite a desperate state ' financially , she said			1
jurors had previously been told how @entity0 had denied causing the fatal injuries when questionned by police , but that he gave no explanation about how they were caused			1
he later claimed that @entity2 had fallen off the bed and hit her head while he was asleep			2
then , on the day his trial was due to start in may , he produced a radically different account , accepting for the first time that he caused the injuries , the court heard			2
he said he had shaken his daugher and thrown her on the bed			0
from there , she fell to the floor , he claimed			0
but the prosecutor said that @entity0 had still failed to account for all the injuries @entity2 suffered			1
an examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant 's teeth imprint , the court heard			0
prosecutor @entity162 had told the court that baby @entity2 was a ' helpless infant , entirely dependent upon the love and care of her parents '			2
he said : ' she suffered very serious and extensive injuries - to her head and body , both externally and internally			2
' the nature of these injuries tells you what the person who inflicted them intended			0
' all those injuries occurred when she was in the sole care of her father			0
the court had previously heard how ms @entity44 , an agency worker , had returned to the house she shared with @entity0 , pictured together above , to find their daughter dead in her cot ' as he committed those acts of violence against @entity2 , he must have intended to kill her or to cause her really serious harm - that is murder			1
' after changing his plea during today 's hearing , the judge told the jury that they had heard @entity0 ' ' clear and voluntary confession of guilt '			2
he told them : ' this is a distressing case and a tragic one			0
you are relieved of the burden of listening to that evidence			0
' after the sentencing , superintendent @entity200 , of @entity201 , said : ' the appalling nature of this crime has been reflected in the sentence handed down to @entity0 today			1
' @entity0 did not want to look after his daughter and his response was brutally violent			2
the baby 's injuries were likened to those suffered in a car crash or as a result of being dropped from a one - storey building			2
' he failed to seek assistance that could have saved her life and then refused to tell the truth on arrest and right through the legal process			0
' @entity2 's mother is continuing to rebuild her life and i hope the conclusion of the legal process today and the knowledge that justice has been done makes that process a little easier			1
