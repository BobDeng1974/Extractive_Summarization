described as sparkling ' like a jewel , ' the long - lost piece was discovered after an auction house in @entity9 inquired about the art work 's gifting to the @entity12 in 1963			1
at the time of its donation it was not believed to have been an actual work by @entity1 , despite its signature , and so never saw the museum 's walls			1
found : @entity1 's seated woman with @entity2 has been unearthed from the @entity12 in @entity5 after reported lost for nearly 50 years ' when the @entity12 received the gift , associated documentation indicated that the piece was created by an artist named “ @entity28 ” , ' the museum said in a release this week			1

upon researching @entity1 's previous gemmaux pieces earlier this year , auction house @entity43 's in @entity9 inquired upon the museum 's while seeing it labelled as such after its gift from international designer @entity48			1
