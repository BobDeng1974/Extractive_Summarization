it was a second set visit for the @entity1 in two days after she met @entity3 experts , 24 hours after touring the @entity4 set in @entity5			1
while she refused to take a seat on the @entity9 drama 's infamous @entity7 , today the @entity1 was all smiles , eagerly picking up a minature bronze horse taken from the @entity12			1
she even confessed to watching the show , with the @entity14 quizzing producers and presenter @entity15 about when the episode starring them would air			1
' among the pieces to find favour with the monarch was a small , bronze sculpture of a horse and jockey , believed to be of the 1863 @entity25 winner @entity27			1
the history of the work by @entity43 artist @entity42 , and the race , stirred interest after the experts revealed the @entity25 winner took home the spoils after 32 false starts			1
' it seems very incompetent does n’t it , ' commented the @entity1 , a racehorse owner who has had runners in the @entity25 herself			1
' just the thing ! the @entity1 appeared more enamoured with the @entity3 than @entity4 gracious guest : the queen took time to sign the visitor 's book at @entity59 leaving his mark : prince @entity14 was also keen to leave his signature in the guest book enjoying herself : the queen appeared particularly enamoured with the bronze of @entity27 with its gentle experts and enthusiasm for all things historical , @entity3 is far more in keeping with the @entity1 's personal taste than @entity4 , although @entity70 refused to confirm which of the shows @entity1 watches			1
the @entity9 drama , which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by @entity76 , is thought to be loosely based on the @entity77 , which saw two opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of @entity80			1
with @entity82 on one side and @entity81 on the other , @entity80 was convulsed by a series of battles , dastardly plots and pretenders lurking on the other side of the @entity90 until , with the death of @entity92 , @entity81 finally triumphed			1
although the @entity1 is a descendant of the @entity81 - and is the current holder of both title and duchy - she appeared far more engaged when discussing antiques with the @entity99 experts			1
along with @entity27 's bronze , the royal couple were also shown a @entity102 library table , which is one of a pair kept at @entity59 , an 18th century @entity106 soup tureen and five figurines from a @entity109 monkey orchestra - both of which are held in the @entity112 of @entity113			1
one of the more interesting pieces was a @entity116 stick which was gifted to the @entity1 on her tour of @entity118 in 1954 , although there was no explanation for how the @entity122 fighting club ended up in @entity59			2
greeting : the @entity1 was also introduced to @entity3 's presenter , @entity15 interesting : the queen with @entity3 experts @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 prince @entity14 was particularly interested in the club but could n't resist a joke questioning the evidence linking the item to the royal collection			1
' where ’s the evidence ? ' he quipped			0
' the story between then and now is mysterious , ' riposted @entity3 's bric - à - brac expert , @entity127			0
' i think that ’s like a lot of things that arrive here in the palace without any clear knowledge of how or why			0
all the things here ( on the table ) are in the house for one reason or another without the back story			0
' take your fancy ? the @entity1 was particularly keen on a silver christening cup that has a strong connection to the @entity153 mr @entity127 and fellow experts @entity128 , a ceramics and @entity157 specialist , and @entity126 introduced the items and spent 10 minutes with the royals			2
among the items shown by ms @entity126 to the @entity1 was a christening cup that has a strong connection to the royal family			2
' what was lovely about this is , this is a piece unlike the other objects as it has a direct family connection , ' she said			0
' she loved the silver and she was very interested in the stories behind the items - they were both interested in everything on the table			0
' one is not sitting there ! the @entity1 chose to give the @entity7 a wide berth during a visit to the @entity9 set @entity180 to meet you : the @entity1 met @entity4 cast , among them @entity184 and @entity185 the cup was gifted to the daughter of the chief engineer on a transatlantic liner after she was born while @entity190 , @entity191 , and his wife , were travelling on the ship to @entity194			1
on hearing the news @entity195 , the @entity1 ’s aunt , said she would send a gift for the new arrival , @entity199			0
the @entity1 was told how the young woman gifted the silver cup back to the royal family , along with two family photographs , to add to their collections			0
afterwards , the @entity1 was flown by helicopter from @entity59 to @entity207 in @entity208 , where they are guests of honour at an event marking the work of the @entity213			2
the @entity1 ended her three day trip on a somber note as she lay a wreath as tribute to the @entity219 servicemen who died in the @entity220			0
her majesty and prince @entity222 were guests of honour at the commemorative event in @entity207 to mark the centenary of the outbreak of conflict and those who lost their lives in the four years that followed			0
servicemen from all over @entity113 fought in the @entity220 , which ended three years before the island was partitioned			2
the @entity1 and prince @entity14 laid a wreath as tribute to the fallen soldiers of @entity113 in @entity220 members of the @entity213 from both sides of the @entity219 border joined the @entity1 and @entity14 at the civic reception in the @entity239			0
despite a heavy downpour , the @entity1 and @entity14 were met by hundreds of well - wishers , hoping to steal a glimpse of the royal couple			2
there was a somber mood at @entity207 as the royal couple and well - wishers stood for a minutes silence there was a nostalgic feel to the afternoon as re-enactors dressed in period costume for the memorial the streets of @entity207 were bursting with crowds waving @entity256 and local shopkeepers and office workers took a break to watch from the windows of their businesses			0
the town created a nostalgic feel to the day with re-enactors dressed in period costume and , after the solemnity of the wreath laying and minute 's silence , the @entity1 embarked on a walkabout to say greet some of her adoring fans			0
the @entity1 wore a mournful expression at today 's memorial despite a downpour of rain , hundreds of well - wishers came to catch a glimpse of the @entity1 and @entity14 flattered : the queen was treated to pretty posies of flowers by many of the well - wishers royal wave : despite the overcast weather the @entity1 seemed pleased to greet her public			0
