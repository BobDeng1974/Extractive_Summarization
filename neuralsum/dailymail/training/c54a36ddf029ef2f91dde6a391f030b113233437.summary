that was the most one - sided game i have ever seen			2
it was a complete annihilation			0
we thought @entity4 would be better once they stopped playing @entity5 but this was worse			1
give full credit to @entity8 because they produced the most complete performance i have seen in one - day international cricket			1
the way @entity13 led them with imaginative , attacking tactics and aggressive field placings made this a lesson for @entity4 in how to play modern one - day cricket			1
@entity20 described @entity13 as ' the most destructive batsman in the world ' after @entity4 's heavy loss the bottom line is that @entity4 still play old - fashioned limited - overs cricket			1
their default position in difficult times is still to go back to @entity29 players , like we have seen with @entity31 , rather than a more attacking option			0
if they keep going down that road they will keep getting bitten			0
they look a fearful side who were up against a team playing without fear			0
it was swing bowling that did for them — orthodox swing bowling like they would have faced since they were kids			0
very good swing bowling from @entity48 , yes , but this is international cricket and opposition bowlers are allowed to swing it			0
@entity8 captain @entity13 seems to enjoy the moment as he consoles @entity4 captain @entity20 this was n’t mystery spin or sub-continental conditions			1
they should have coped much better than they did			0
look at how @entity13 went about it in reply			1
ok , he is in the form of his life and he was only chasing 123 but he came charging at @entity4 and did not let them settle			2
in contrast , most of our batsmen look out of nick			0
i hope whoever was responsible for making those late changes to @entity4 ’s team before they played @entity5 will sit back now and learn from this			2
all we are doing is going round in circles when we should have been settled			0
@entity4 's @entity78 ( left ) , @entity76 and @entity77 trudge off the field after defeat by @entity8 i ’m not one for always thinking that players outside the team are better than the ones in it and i ’m not sure @entity4 would achieve anything from throwing @entity86 in now			1
@entity86 should have been picked for the 50 - over team as soon as he scored that @entity88 century in @entity89 and he would have played 20 one - day internationals by now			1
yes , he had a few technical problems when he first played in @entity92 but that ’s what happens at the highest level			0
as it is we drop people like him before we have given them a proper chance and their confidence evaporates			0
@entity4 back players in test cricket but do not have the same principles in one - day cricket			1
@entity48 tore through @entity4 's batting order , taking 7 - 33 and restricting @entity4 to 123 all out @entity76 is bowled by @entity48 to kick - start @entity4 's humiliation by the co-hosts now it is clear there is a huge gulf between what @entity5 and @entity8 are doing and what @entity4 are producing			1
so how do we close the gap in time for this @entity115 ? @entity4 have got to ask why players like @entity86 and @entity117 are playing fearlessly for their counties , the @entity119 , and in the @entity120 but are not doing it with @entity4			1
what happens to them when they get inside that @entity4 dressing room ? are they being weighed down by too many theories ? it should be about the culture of a team , not endless strategies			2
@entity20 must look at the way his good friend @entity13 is doing the job and go down that same road			2
and do it as quickly as possible .			0

@entity4 were annihilated by @entity8 at the @entity115 on friday
@entity13 's side showed how to play modern one - day cricket
the @entity139 captain was imaginative , attacking and aggressive
