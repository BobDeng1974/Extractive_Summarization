by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 19:04 est , 12 february 2013 litter police have been told to issue £ 80 on - the - spot fines for the ‘ disgusting and inappropriate ’ practice of spitting in the street			1
last month the @entity5 told how councils had deployed private litter police to hand out fines for dropping items such as cigarette butts , bank cards , nut shells and even pens			1

that means litter police who have previously targeted people dropping cigarette butts , crisp packets and takeaway boxes can issue fines to those caught spitting			1
fines : bosses at @entity60 were able to get round the bureaucracy of introducing a bylaw by classing spit and urine as waste the civil enforcement officers can also hand out tickets to people found urinating in the @entity69 , deputy leader of @entity16 council , said : ‘ it ’s horrible to witness and leaves an unsanitary mess on our paths and pavements			1
‘ why people think it is acceptable to indulge in what must be the most anti-social of all behaviours is a mystery , but they do			2
‘ in the past people would not have thought twice about throwing a cigarette butt on the pavement , or letting their dog leave a mess on a pathway			2
‘ in the same way , i think we need to make spitting and urinating taboo			2
‘ i do n’t believe the vast majority of people need telling that it is disgusting and inappropriate			2
@entity60 wants to make spitting taboo by introducing the new penalties ‘ but this move sends out an unequivocal message to those people who spit or treat our streets like a toilet			1
