for @entity1 the wait is over and one of rugby league ’s great peculiarities is no more			1
not since 1999 had this great sporting institution celebrated a @entity7 victory			1
six times they had tried in recent years and six times , remarkably , they had failed			0
now , after this compelling and deserved victory over neighbours and underdogs @entity13 , @entity15 ’s team have the sport ’s most cherished trophy back in their possession again			2
@entity19 : @entity1 celebrate their first @entity7 trophy success in 15 years delighted : @entity15 looks over the moon after leading @entity1 to @entity7 success celebrations : @entity24 ( left ) and @entity15 hold aloft the @entity26 trophy big occasion : @entity13 and @entity1 met at @entity28 for the 113th final of its type early lead : @entity32 scores the first try of the game at @entity28 few could argue with the result either			1
@entity1 began well , scored an early try through winger @entity32 and never really looked back			1
@entity13 , the surprise entity of the rugby league season , railed briefly at the start of the second half and the game was alive when @entity42 powered over to bring the score back to 16 - 10			2
but this was a day when @entity1 always looked destined to win and it was fitting that one of the games true titans , winger @entity49 , scored his second try late in the game to earn himself the @entity51 and his team the victory			1
given the enormity of the occasion and the challenge facing them , it seemed imperative that @entity13 started the game well			2
unfortunately for @entity61 ’s team , they could n’t find their rhythm and it only took @entity1 a matter of minutes to score			2
the big @entity13 prop @entity64 – playing just two weeks after dislocating his elbow – tried to lay down something of a marker with an early hit on @entity24 but @entity1 began with purpose and zest and it was n’t a surprise when pressure build down the left allowed the favourites to move the ball across the field where centre @entity77 supplied @entity32 with an invitation to dive over in the right corner			1
crucial : @entity81 scores his side 's second try of the game against @entity13 clinical : @entity86 scores his side 's second try of the afternoon in the @entity28 showdown against @entity13 @entity24 kicked with customary precision and calm from the touchline and @entity1 were away			1
for a while , @entity13 did show something of their true selves			2
winger @entity97 was unfortunate not to score when he went over only for referee @entity98 to pull play back			0
a minute or so later , however , @entity13 were over as @entity99 ran on to a @entity100 kick to bundle @entity101 out of the way and touch down			0
despite @entity100 missing a rather kickable conversion , @entity13 were back in the game but it was the period between then and the interval that left them with such a long road back			0
@entity1 , at this point , were just too precise , too reliable			0
@entity1 ’ second try was certainly a poor one from a @entity13 point of view as full - back @entity114 stood transfixed beneath a routine @entity117 kick and @entity81 leapt above him to score			1
with @entity24 kicking expertly once again , this time from the left , @entity1 had their noses in front and six minutes later they came up with one of the tries of which they are so capable			0
seemingly pinned down on his own goal line , @entity101 somehow sprung three tackles to make 50 metres and begin a sequence that ended with @entity49 forcing his way past @entity127 from a standing start to bundle the ball over			0
euphoria : @entity86 celebrates his try as he puts his team in the ascendancy before half - time high hopes : @entity13 fans look ahead to the @entity7 final at @entity28 it was classic play from @entity49 , one of @entity141 ’s most remarkable athletes , and , despite @entity24 missing the conversion , it have @entity1 a 16 - 4 half - time lead they never really looked like relinquishing			1
@entity13 did find some rather belated adrenaline to feed off early in the second half and scored their second try on the back of a breakaway that saw @entity150 , @entity114 and @entity151 combine to send in the second row @entity42			2
on another day , @entity61 ’s brave team may have used that score as a platform for recovery			0
here , though , @entity1 were not to be denied and perhaps the decisive try of the afternoon arrived with 13 minutes left			0
this time it was @entity1 interchange @entity159 who did the groundwork , scurrying laterally along the ten metre line to feed @entity49			1
once again the big winger had everything to do as three @entity13 men stood between him and the line			0
seconds later , though , @entity167 , @entity42 and @entity168 lay on the floor like crumpled white bed sheets as @entity1 celebrated the score that means that in the pubs of places like @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 they must now find something else to laugh about .			0

@entity1 saw off their @entity182 rivals @entity13 at @entity28 on *saturday*
@entity49 impressed as he scored two tries for the @entity1
@entity1 last won the @entity7 in 1999
