@entity0 says that even the richest man in the world could not buy the derby joy he and his @entity5 side experienced on sunday			1
the @entity5 claimed a fourth successive victory over arch - rivals @entity7 and their third on the trot at @entity9 at the weekend to leave @entity10 wreathed in smiles and the men who secured it experiencing ' unique ' emotions			1
@entity0 revealed even a post-match warm - down and an enforced prolonged stay on @entity17 could not spoil the party			1
@entity19 fires @entity5 into a 1 - 0 lead to earn all three points for @entity0 's side against @entity7 @entity19 ( 11 ) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of @entity7 goalkeeper @entity25 he said : ' i know how much it means			1
we scored and we went ballistic and it was difficult to control the bench - imagine how much it means for them ( the fans ) , who have been supporting this club all their lives ? ' it was special			2
it 's so special that it does n't matter how long you have to stay at the ground , because we were held for a while			0
normally you would have every single player complaining , ' @entity43 '			0
' nobody complained , everybody was all right , everything changed			0
even if you say to them to go and do a warm - down and they need to go back to the pitch , it was no problem this time			2
' it 's unique , it 's the best part of football			0
it 's not about money			2
i 'm sure that the biggest multi-millionaire in the world would pay whatever money it takes to be part of that moment			2
the @entity5 winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at @entity67 @entity5 boss @entity0 said money can not buy the feeling of winning a @entity70 ' and you know what ? he ca n't because you need to be a football player or be involved in football to be there and feel it			1
it 's not about money , it 's about being good enough			0
' @entity0 , who was installed as the club 's new head coach in october last year , boasts a 100 per cent record in his three derbies to date having quickly gleaned just how important those games are to two clubs and their respective fans			1
the win was just @entity5 's third in the @entity89 in 17 attempts this season and while @entity0 will now turn his attention to the @entity94 clash with struggling @entity95 and the business of putting together back - to - back victories , he knows just what their latest success means to the supporters			1
he said : ' i 'll tell you what , when you come here you know you need to win one or two games , especially these ones , and the times you win them , there is no better			0
@entity19 looks towards the @entity7 fans as he is joined by his @entity5 team - mates in celebration ' i do n't think they care too much about the rest , the fans , they just care about this one , and it 's great to be on this side of it			1
there is no better feeling			0
' now we are already somehow thinking " can we go one better when we play at the @entity120 ? " every single game now between us and @entity7 is going to be bigger because of that record			1
' sunday 's victory was all the more impressive as it came after @entity124 , the club 's only fit specialist left back , limped out of the warm - up with a calf injury , although one which has proved to be not as serious as was first feared			2
@entity0 said : ' it 's an injury , but it 's a muscle tear			2
we were really worried because of the translation of what he felt , we were thinking it was something really bad			0
@entity5 manager @entity0 reacts furiously to the first half foul from @entity138 defender @entity137 @entity139 filled in at left back for the @entity5 on sunday and @entity0 praised the experienced defender ' but in the end , it 's just a tear and the normal time would be between three and four weeks			1
it 's not lucky that he 's injured , but we feared the worst , so it 's not that bad			0
' hugely - experienced skipper @entity139 was asked to step out of central defence to plug the gap , and he performed his role with aplomb to win fresh praise from @entity0			1
the @entity153 said : ' experience , understanding , composure - it 's great to have him			0
that 's why he 's the skipper			0
you do n't pick them just by luck , you know what you need and it was easy			0
