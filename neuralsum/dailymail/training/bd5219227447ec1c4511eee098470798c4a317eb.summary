only 18 months ago , @entity0 and @entity1 faced each other in the @entity3 final			1
on saturday , they clash again – but in very different circumstances			1
@entity0 have lost none of their superpower aura since winning the treble in 2013			1
on the contrary , under @entity8 , they are developing into an even more formidable force			0
one humiliation at the hands of @entity13 aside , @entity0 undoubtedly remain one of the dominant forces in @entity17 football			1
in @entity1 , nothing could be further from the truth			2
@entity21 's team languish in 15th place in the @entity23 , with only seven points from their first nine games			1
more significantly , @entity1 's defence is in tatters : shapeless , error prone and lacking in confidence			1
at the moment , @entity21 's side panic whenever they endure a set back			2
the fear of defeat appears to weigh over them			0
as @entity21 put it two weeks ago : ' we need to be more clinical in front of their goal , and have more concentration in front of ours '			0
those two factors remain the two most important ones			0
@entity1 are pressing well as usual , and with @entity52 back in the side , are now playing with a renewed pace			2
yet they still lack coherence at the back , perhaps due to the long term injuries to @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 last season			0
the defence is a familiar one , but it lacks playing time together , and the communication still needs work			0
up front , new strikers @entity80 and @entity82 have shown promise , but they are struggling to fill the gap left by @entity86			0
once again , communication is an issue , and many have questioned whether @entity80 in particular fits the @entity21 system			0
as a classical , penalty box striker , it is unclear how well he can keep up with the fluidity of @entity1 's attacks			1
@entity1 's @entity80 ( left ) has failed to fill the void left by @entity86 ( right ) who joined @entity0 @entity1 wore their @entity3 kit to break their @entity23 ' hoodoo ' but still lost 1 - 0 to @entity100 their woes have been eased somewhat by a fine run of form in the @entity3 and a solid 3 - 0 defeat of @entity105 in the @entity106 this week			1
but as local paper waz put it , ' @entity1 still need to improve '			2
they have tried almost everything			0
the players even decided to wear their special @entity3 shirts in last weekend 's game against @entity100 , in a superstitious bid to produce a win			0
@entity1 lost 1 - 0 at home despite dominating the game , and their miserable league run continued			2
@entity0 , on the other hand , are scoring goals for fun			2
they have scored 20 goals in their last four games , and one of those was a 0 - 0 draw			0
@entity46 is set to return from injury against @entity1 , while @entity128 made his first start for @entity0 this season against @entity131 in midweek			1
@entity1 go into saturday 's clash against @entity0 off the back of a 3 - 0 win vs @entity105 in the @entity106 despite their poor form , @entity1 did beat @entity0 2 - 0 in the @entity136 at the start of the season the @entity139 , though , remain cautious in the build up to the @entity1 game			1
@entity8 is famously a huge admirer of @entity1 's pacy , counter attacking football , while various figures in @entity146 have warned against complacency			1
' this @entity1 team is always going to be dangerous , ' said @entity149 this week , ' we 're not going to be 5 - 0 up at half time			2
we have to be ruthless			0
both teams know each other well , and we 've had a lot of tight games in recent times			0
' @entity21 has already opined this season that his system tends to work better against more open , attacking teams			0
with a bit more space , @entity1 can utilise their counter attacks more effectively , as they did when they beat @entity0 2 - 0 in the @entity136 two months ago			1
@entity0 will be boosted by the return of @entity128 ( left ) who made his first start of the season in midweek @entity0 winger @entity46 ( left ) is set to return from injury for saturday 's clash at the @entity169 too that might go some way to explaining their differing form in the @entity3 and the @entity23			1
domestically , they have been overcome almost exclusively by inferior teams who set up to defend , while in @entity177 they have come up against better , more attacking sides such as @entity179			0
despite now being at opposite ends of the table , the rivalry between the two clubs remains as strong as ever – largely as a result of off field issues			0
having already snapped up @entity186 and @entity86 from their rivals , @entity0 are now flirting with the idea of poaching @entity52			2
though no official move has yet been made for the player , @entity1 have been infuriated by repeated statements of interest from the @entity0 board			1
a victory against their fierce rivals on saturday could turn @entity1 's season around , particularly if they follow it up with a win against second place @entity198 the following week			1
another two defeats , however , and @entity21 's side could find themselves in the relegation zone			0
@entity0 midfielder @entity186 ( left ) joined the @entity204 giants for £ 31.5million from @entity1 last summer @entity0 have been linked with a summer move for @entity1 star @entity52 @entity206 believes karma will bite @entity0			1

@entity0 host @entity1 in saturday 's @entity23 clash
@entity0 sit top of the @entity23 and *undefeated* after nine matches so far
@entity1 lie 15th with seven points after a *terrible* start to the season
