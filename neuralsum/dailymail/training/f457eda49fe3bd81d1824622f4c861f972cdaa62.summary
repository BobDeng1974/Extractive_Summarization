@entity9 , an 1,700 - pound @entity10			1
he is also known as @entity12 of the @entity13			0
the eight - year - old is so well - respected in his homeland of @entity16 that he is embarking on a ten - city testimonial retirement tour to give his fans a chance to say goodbye ... and see him buck just one last time			1
indeed , his legend is such that , on saturday , any @entity22 cowboy will earn a $ 25,000 bonus if he can stay on board @entity24 for the required eight seconds			1
' cool as a cat ' : the eight - year - old , 1,700 - pound beast has all but one of the 57 cowboys brave enough to ride him			2
but outside the bullring , he 's known as a very cool customer then , on march 1 , he will take center stage at the @entity35 event at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , the winner of which will be awarded $ 1million			2
' i want him to be known as the greatest bull ever , and i do n't want to go two , three years down the road and let him tire , ' owner @entity40 , 60 , told the @entity45			2
' to retire him at the top of his game , like the great racehorse secretariat … that last vision of him should be of him at his best			2
' @entity24 , who travels the country in a $ 50,000 trailer that he bought himself , was @entity52 in 2010 , 2011 and 2013 and was runner - up 2012			1
to ' win ' at bull riding , cowboys have to stay on for a minimum of eight seconds with just a braided rope tied round the bull called the ' flank strap ' to hold on to			1
@entity12 of the @entity13 : the eight - year - old , 1,700 - pound beast is so well - respected in his homeland of @entity16 that he is embarking on a ten - city testimonial retirement tour to give his fans a chance to say goodbye ... and see him buck just one last time the ride is then scored from 0 – 100 points			1
both the rider and the bull are awarded points			2
but there is just one rider out of 57 who , in the past five years , has managed to stay on board @entity24 for eight seconds			1
' i was 10 feet tall and bulletproof when it was over , ' pro cowboy @entity76 told the @entity45			2
' it 's a bull everyone was scared of , said could n't be rode			0
' what separates @entity24 from other bulls is not that he is strong but that he 's smart , says @entity76			1
' his signature is that his first jump out of the chute is long [ measured at eight yards ] , ' says @entity76 who was thrown by @entity24 in their 11 previous showdowns			1
' most bulls , when they rear up in the air , they come straight back down and kick over their head			0
@entity93 , he goes forward and up at the same time and then he breaks and kicks			0
' while @entity76 says the two are now friends of sorts , he knows never to get too near to the beast when posing for pictures - even after they 've won a prize			0
fearsome : bull riding is known as the most dangerous eight seconds in sport @entity40 says anyone other than one handler will get ' smashed ' or ' thrown over the fence ' for trying to pet the grumpy animal			0
but when it 's time for business , @entity24 is well known as a true professional			1
' he does n't try to lean against the gate or cheat in any way like other bulls do , ' veteran @entity22 cowboy @entity109 told the paper			0
' stands square , right in the middle of the chute , lets you get your rope pulled as tight as you want it			0
to be that cool and that rank is unique			0
' and when he 's thrown whichever rider is foolish enough to try him out to the ground , he does n't trample them or gore them with his horns ... he just runs back into his pen , ready for another round			0
he does n't like people much either , says @entity40			0
instead he like nothing more than to dig up dirt with his hoof in his pen and snort to his heart 's content .			0
