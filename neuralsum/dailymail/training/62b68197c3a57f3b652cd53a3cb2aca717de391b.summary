a trial at @entity36 - where @entity30 is in the dock with three ' brides ' , two ' grooms ' and an alleged accessory to the plot - heard the unions were ' less about passion and more about profit '			1
@entity30 , of @entity36 , @entity41 , is said to have run a bride delivery service for almost four years until july last year , helping the four desperate men stay in @entity24			1
jurors heard that when one bride tried to pull out , vile threats were made against her and her children			1
another was paid £ 7,000 , then lived 150 miles from her husband and claimed unemployment benefits as a single woman			2
a third had to text her husband to find out ' their ' address , the court heard			1

despite the couple marrying in june 2012 , the alleged notes detailed the colour of mr @entity60 's walls and carpets			2
prosecutor @entity67 added : ' it gave his height , weight , shoe size , details of the early stages of their relationship and the frequency of their love - making			1
' mr @entity60 had been in @entity24 on a student visa since 2006 , but the wedding at @entity81 was reported to the @entity82 after the registrar noted there was ' little interaction ' between the pair before the ceremony @entity88 , from @entity89 , was allegedly a scout for other sham brides - and was paid a £ 250 ' commission ' for each one she found			2
one of those was @entity95 , who has already pleaded guilty to conspiring to breach immigration law after marrying @entity97 , who is on trial			1

prosecutor mr @entity67 told the court : ' this is a case about sham marriages			2
' you will hear about four weddings , and how they were built not on love , mutual respect and companionship , but a combination of greed and dishonesty			0
' mr @entity67 said @entity24 immigration laws allow foreign nationals who fall in love with a @entity24 citizen to apply to stay in the country			0
' there are those desperate to stay in this country that are prepared to exploit that weakness , ' he said			0
' money can buy you a @entity24 bride and so , through her , buy you the means to deceive the authorities into giving you a right to stay as her spouse			0
' the four women in this case were prepared - for the promise of money - to marry men they did n't know			2
' their marriages were less about passion and more about profit			0

accused : @entity152 ( left ) is accused of allowing his bank account to be used ; @entity154 ( right ) was an alleged groom after wanting to remain in @entity24 when his five - year - old student visa expired in 2011 the couple married at @entity157 in january 2010 , and two months later @entity147 applied to the @entity82 for indefinite leave to remain in @entity24			0
but instead of living in @entity151 with his new wife , @entity147 lived and worked 150 miles away in @entity36 , the court heard			1
his wife , a security guard , was reportedly paid £ 7,000 for her trouble			0
mr @entity67 asked jurors : ' was it a mere act of generosity by a lovestruck new husband or was it part of as concerted effort to leave his name on official paperwork to prove that the couple lived together ? ' the second wedding was between @entity105 , 29 , from @entity89 , and @entity154 , 28 , from @entity36			2
six weeks before his five - year - old student visa was due to expire in december 2011 , @entity154 gave notice of his intention to marry @entity175 at @entity176			0
investigators later found a ' fistful ' of receipts under a mattress at his home showing he had paid just under £ 2,000 into @entity175 's bank account			0
' it might be called proof of purchase , ' said mr @entity67			0
mr @entity67 said although @entity175 was ' married ' , she claimed benefits as a single woman			0
text messages found on her phone indicated an ' intimate ' relationship with another man within five months of the wedding - and she had to ask where her husband lived			0
