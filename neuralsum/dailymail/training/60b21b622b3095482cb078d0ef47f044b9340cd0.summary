on screen , she said : ‘ @entity33 ’s jobs numbers are a puzzle which keeps getting harder to solve			0

presenter @entity79 said : ‘ when the economy gets smaller , you would expect unemployment to go up			0
but something strange is going on			0
’ mr @entity1 told this newspaper : ‘ the @entity3 is locked to the reading of the economy that is run out of @entity23 and @entity25 ’ office			1
they think if only you spend and borrow more money you can create growth everywhere			0
this is the general tenor of everything that comes out of the @entity3			1
‘ they expected the [ employment ] figures to be flatlining			1
they convinced themselves youth unemployment would continue to rise , but when it fell they were in a complete quandary			0
‘ @entity2 poured cold water over the whole thing			1
she said , “ of course this is good news , but it could be because we are n’t productive enough			0
” ‘ then she got a woman who was set up as a health worker who has gone self - employed – as though being self - employed is not legitimate – and she [ @entity2 ] said , “ this is all hidden unemployment because they are self - employed			2
” ‘ guess what the self - employed person said ? “ i could be some of the hidden unemployment figures			2
” ‘ they had popped those words into her mouth			0

‘ we were all told , “ it ’s no good , you ca n’t lay off these public sector workers , they ’ll never find jobs , the private sector will never expand			0
” ‘ when we got elected the public sector was squeezing the hell out of the private sector			0

‘ they are used to getting their money with no requirement to get a job and have an “ i do n’t have to work if i do n’t want to ” attitude			0
yet the @entity3 has said nothing about that			2
all we get is carping and moaning			0

as a nation we are near on bust			0
we have a massive deficit and no longer live in the land of milk and honey where we can solve problems by throwing money at them			0
