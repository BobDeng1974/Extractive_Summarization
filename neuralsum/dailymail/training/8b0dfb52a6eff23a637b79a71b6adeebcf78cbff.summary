there could be a deadly killer in your home – the kitchen tap			2
last year in @entity5 , two people died from a single - celled organism that thrives in warm , freshwater after using tap water for flushing their sinuses			1
the amoeba , known as @entity12 , can cause primary amoebic meningoecephalitis ( @entity14 ) , which is fatal in 99 per cent of cases			2
deadly infection : the amoeba , known as @entity12 , can cause primary amoebic meningoecephalitis ( @entity14 ) , which is fatal in 99 per cent of cases the nose knows : in 2011 , two people in @entity5 who used tap water in neti pots to flush out their sinuses caught the deadly infection both victims , a 51 - year - old woman and a 28 - year - old man , had used tap water in neti pots to flush out their sinuses and died days later			1
they lived in separate areas of the state			0
neti pots are generally safe for use for clearing out excess mucus in the nasal cavity , but when amoebas are present , the infection has a frighteningly fatal rate			2
according to the @entity37 , the amoeba enters the brain through the nasal passage , especially when people go swimming in warm freshwater lakes and ponds			1
in a report published by dr @entity44 , who works at the @entity45 for @entity46 and @entity47 , a division of the @entity37 , concluded that in both cases , the victims had only come in contact with the amoeba from tap water			1
he and a group of researchers tested the water from both houses			0
their results were published in @entity60 on august 23			0
dr @entity61 and the other authors found the amoeba in the kitchen spigot , shower , bathtub , and bathroom sink in the woman ’s home			0
path of infection : n. fowleri can only enter the body through the nasal passage or broken skin , not through drinking water growth process : the single - celled amoeba is also called a brain - eating amoeba ; later symptoms can include hallucinations and seizures they found @entity12 in a tankless water heater in the home of the 28 - year - old man			1
the authors noted that the municipal water sources were not contaminated in either case			0
the residents lived in different parts of the state			0
the @entity37 says that one can not contract the organism simply through drinking water , and urges those using nasal irrigation systems to either use distilled or bottled water , or boil their tap water for at least a minute to ensure the @entity100 fowleri amoeba is killed			1
the centre also notes that there have been few infections in the @entity104 throughout the past decades			0
preventative measures : the @entity37 recommends that those near warm , fresh water avoid swimming in it , or holding your nose when going underwater from 2002 to 2011 , there were 32 infections reported			2
included in those statistics are the two people from @entity5 who used neti pots to flush out their noses			1
initial symptoms begin five days after infection , but could take as long as seven , and include headache , fever , nausea , and even vomiting			0
in the later phases when the amoeba reaches the brain tissue , those suffering from the infection may lose balance , hallucinate , and experience seizures , and in 99 per cent of cases , die			2
the @entity37 notes that only one person out of 123 infected has survived			0
it reminds those who will be swimming in warm , fresh water to use nasal plugs , hold one ’s nose shut , or avoid going under water altogether , though infection from n. fowleri is extremely rare .			1

in 2011 , two people in @entity5 died after using tap water for nasal irrigation
@entity144 known as @entity100 fowleri can infect brain and enters through nasal passage
once infected , organism is 99 *%* fatal
