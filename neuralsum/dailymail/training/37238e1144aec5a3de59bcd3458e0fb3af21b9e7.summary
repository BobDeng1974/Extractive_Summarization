it is n't what @entity1 would have hoped for when he imagined today 's return to @entity4 — a place on the bench , the grim predicament he thought he had left behind			1
the 24 - year - old fly - half will be on the other side of the halfway line and no longer in the cherry and white of @entity13 , but his seat among @entity16 's replacements will bring back sombre memories			1
@entity1 spent a prolonged period watching games unfold from that vantage point last season , biding his time , trying gamely to suppress his frustration			1
he faces the same challenge this afternoon			2
the @entity25 no 10 contender has been dropped from the @entity16 ' starting xv for the @entity27 clash against his former club and the demotion could n't have come at a worse time			1
he would have desperately craved a leading role in his first encounter with so many familiar faces and also a chance to enhance his @entity36 case			2
@entity1 was recently dropped from the @entity16 xv but wants to be considered for @entity25 instead , he has been usurped by @entity38 , for a fixture which comes 18 days before @entity25 coach @entity41 names his senior squad for the autumn internationals			1
competition for the playmaker places is especially fierce at present and all the candidates will be determined to avoid disruption to their momentum			2
@entity49 is the preferred stand - off , but he remains unavailable to @entity51 as he recovers from a hamstring strain			2
in his absence , @entity1 is vying with three other men for a possible two places in the @entity25 squad			1
he has the benefit of being the incumbent at @entity59 , but that last @entity36 came in @entity60 where the national team were crushed by the @entity62 , so involvement there is not a feather in the cap			2
@entity1 ( @entity16 ) strengths : unpredictable creative threat , with vision and all the tricks			1
weaknesses : dropped by his club and recovering from form slump			2
@entity75 ( @entity76 ) strengths : clever runner armed with a glorious attacking repertoire			0
weaknesses : less established in @entity25 set - up than rivals			1
@entity49 ( @entity51 ) strengths : competitive streak and composure in @entity86			0
weaknesses : injuries , and doubts persist about all - round ability			0
@entity93 ( @entity94 ) strengths : major talent who can stand flat or deep to torment teams			0
weaknesses : relatively small frame makes him a target			0
@entity103 ( @entity104 ) strengths : calm playmaker and kicker with layer of off - loading class			0
weaknesses : understated qualities are sometimes overlooked			0
last season , once he had decided to leave @entity13 , @entity1 was marginalised by the then director of rugby , @entity113			1
his form collapsed , as did his confidence			0
starting for @entity25 against @entity62 at @entity116 — armed with @entity118 's endorsements — brought the belief and conviction back , but he must strive to overcome this latest setback quickly			1
the new campaign began brightly , with four starts and a particularly impressive display in the win over @entity126 at @entity127			0
but when @entity16 were smashed 45 - 0 at @entity94 , @entity1 was on that sinking ship and he was unable to prevent another defeat last weekend , at home to @entity131			1
individual ambitions are intrinsically linked to collective fortunes , as the @entity16 ' recruit appreciates			0
asked to assess his @entity25 prospects , he said poignantly : ' hopefully , if @entity16 are winning and i 'm playing well i will be there or thereabouts			1
it 's all i can do			2
' @entity41 picks his squad for the @entity142 internationals in 18 days and @entity1 is in the running for no 10 thus , @entity1 needs to play some part in a revival today			1
his hope must be he comes off the bench to help the @entity16 arrest their mini-slump with a win			0
while he bides his time , in the back of his mind will be the realisation his @entity25 rivals have a chance to force him out of the autumn reckoning			1
last night 's @entity94 - @entity51 match presented @entity93 with another high - profile stage to advance his own burgeoning international claims , after missing the summer tour following surgery			2
today , @entity104 's @entity103 will aim to catch the eye at @entity131 , while @entity75 will be determined to lower the colours of his former club , @entity164 , in @entity165 yesterday gave his backing to @entity49 to continue in the conductor 's role , but also suggested the challengers need game - time			2
speaking in @entity171 in his role as a @entity174 ambassador , he told @entity175 : ' i think @entity49 has done a fantastic job and deserves to be leading the team			0
@entity93 , @entity1 and @entity75 are doing all they can — showing they deserve a shot			1
' @entity174 squads do n't include just one no 10			2
you ca n't have one 10 who 's played all the games and one who has n't touched the ball			1
' @entity118 and his coaches await further medial bulletins after a damaging week			0
@entity75 is also a contender for the @entity25 no 10 position after impressing for sale with @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 out of their autumn plans , they will seek assurances about @entity201 's back , after @entity104 confirmed the flanker will miss a third successive match			1
@entity205 captain @entity204 is also missing for the champions , but his absence is precautionary due to a minor back problem			0
@entity13 v @entity16 ( @entity4 , 3.15pm live on @entity209 1 ) @entity210 starts for hosts while @entity212 lock @entity213 is fit for @entity16 bow			0
harlequins v @entity217 ( @entity218 , 3pm ) @entity220 playmaker @entity219 is back for @entity221 , with @entity222 starting for @entity217 against his old club			0
@entity131 v @entity104 ( @entity225 , 3pm ) @entity226 returns for the @entity227 and the champions recall lock @entity229			0
sale v @entity164 ( @entity230 , 2pm sunday , live on @entity209 ) @entity231 is back for the @entity232 , while @entity233 returns to @entity234			0
@entity171 v @entity126 ( @entity236 , sunday 3pm ) @entity237 switches to full back for the @entity171 and @entity126 rest @entity25 wing @entity239			1
prediction : away win .			0

@entity1 was recently dropped from the @entity242
@entity1 is a contender to be @entity25 's no 10 for the autumn internationals
@entity41 picks his @entity25 squad in 18 days
