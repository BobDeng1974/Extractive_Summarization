when @entity0 walked into a restaurant for a romantic meal with his fiancee he expected to be handed a menu			1
he did n’t think the waitress would also try to give him a children ’s colouring book and some crayons			2
unfortunately the well - meaning harvester employee had mistaken him for a child – because while 26 - year - old mr @entity0 , who has dwarfism , is just 3ft 7in tall , his 20 - year - old fiancee @entity11 towers over him at 5ft 7in			1
@entity0 , a 3ft 7in dwarf , took his fiance @entity11 , to a posh restaurant when he was given a children 's colouring book and crayons the waitress was left red faced after realising her mistake when she handed mr @entity0 the children 's colouring book and crayons on his meal out with his fiancée it was only when the waitress heard mr @entity0 ’s deep voice that she realised her mistake			1
while she was covered in embarrassment , her gaffe was the highlight of the night for the couple who have been laughing about it ever since			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ as i said thank you to the waitress for the menu she heard my voice and knew i was n’t a child			1
‘ she immediately put the colouring book behind her back in shock			0
but i am man enough to see the funny side – i would never take offence			1
’ the couple who have been together for 18 months , had been enjoying a romantic meal out when the embarrassing blunder took place they did not complain to the harvester in @entity48 and will visit again with no hard feelings he and miss @entity11 did not complain to the harvester in @entity48 and will visit again with no hard feelings			1
the couple realise they make an unusual sight when they are out together in @entity48 , where she is a third - year education student			1
but they say their mis - matched heights make no difference to them and they are getting married in the summer of 2016			1
mr @entity0 , of @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ‘ life has not been easy – when i was young i had a lot of surgery and went through a time of being bullied in school			2
‘ i have often thought from an early age , who would want to marry me , a dwarf ? but then i met @entity11 and everything just fell into place			2
’ a rare genetic condition called diastrophic dysplasia caused mr @entity0 ’s dwarfism			1
both his parents are of average height			0
he works as a tv presenter , actor and motivational speaker			1
he also competed in the @entity81 twice and played badminton at a national level			0
miss @entity11 , also from @entity61 , said : ‘ all little girls dream about having their tall , dark and handsome @entity85			2
never in my life did i think i ’d date someone like @entity0			2
‘ people sometimes get a bit confused when they see us for the first time but we always laugh it off			0
i felt a bit sorry for the waitress – she felt very uncomfortable			0
’ she added that she did n’t hesitate when mr @entity0 got down on one knee to propose			2
‘ there may be a two - foot height difference between us but when you are in love little things like that do n’t matter , ’ she said			0
a spokesman for @entity103 said : ‘ we ca n’t apologise enough to @entity0 and @entity11 , and are happy they have taken the error in good faith			1
’ @entity108 dysplasia is a rare type of dwarfism			0
the congenital disorder is often characterised by short stature and with short arms and legs			0
it can also be associated with abnormal bone and joint development , curvature of the spine , clubfoot , cleft palate and swelling of the ear tissue			0
it is an autosomal recessive disorder , meaning both mother and father must carry the defective gene for a child to inherit the condition			0
parents are not normally affected by the disorder			0
@entity131 dysplasia is caused by mutations in the @entity134 gene which alters the structure of developing cartilage , preventing bones from forming properly .			0
