by @entity0 stress is bad for our health , but it could also be undermining our relationships with other people , a new study has claimed			1
stressed men tend to become more selfish and less able to understand their own emotions , as well as those of other people , which can mean they behave meanly , according to a team of international scientists			1
however , they discovered that the opposite is true for women , who become more ‘ prosocial , ’ perhaps because they are more able to share their problems and successfully harness external help			1
stressed men ( illustrated ) tend to become more selfish and less able to understand their own emotions , as well as those of other people , which can mean they behave meanly according to a team of international scientists the study found that men tend to become more self - centred and less able to understand other people 's emotions			1
however , women become more ' prosocial ' under pressure			2
they are not exactly sure why women can cope better when stressed			0
dr @entity29 thinks it could be because at a psychological level , women be able to internalise stress and then interact effectively with others to get support			0
' this means the more they need help - and are thus stressed - the more they apply social strategies , ' she said			0
the gender difference might be explained by the oxytocin system			0
the hormone connects social behaviours and a previous study has revealed that women have higher physiological levels of oxytocin than men when they are stressed			2
while women seem to apply social straggles to cope with stressful scenarios , the study hints that men find it harder to communicate and ask for help			1
‘ there 's a subtle boundary between the ability to identify with others and take on their perspective - and therefore be empathic - and the inability to distinguish between self and other , thus acting egocentrically , ’ said of @entity29 from the @entity56 of @entity57 in @entity58			1
‘ to be truly empathic and behave prosocially it 's important to maintain the ability to distinguish between self and other and stress appears to play an important role in this , ’ she said			1
stress is a psycho - biological mechanism that enables a person to recruit extra resources when they are faced with a demanding situation			0
this lets us cope with a stressful scenario by either trying to reduce the internal ‘ extra ’ resources or by seeking external support , she said			0
the researchers , who were also from the @entity80 of the @entity81 and the @entity82 , began their study with a starting hypothesis that stressed individuals tend to be more egocentric			0
the researchers are not sure why women cope better with stress but said that at a psychosocial level , females may have internalised the stressful experience so that they receive more external support by sharing their problems and interacting better with others ( pictured ) they said that taking a selfish perspective reduces the emotional and cognitive load and that they expected people to be less empathetic in the study , which was published in the journal @entity101			1
however , they were surprised to find that only men become more self - centred under stress			2
they created ‘ conditions of moderate stress ’ in a laboratory by forcing participants to take mental arithmetic tests and to make a speech			1
the participants - half of whom were female and the other half male - then had to imitate certain movements to demonstrate motor control , recognise their own or other people ’s emotions or make a judgement taking on another person 's perspective to display cognitive condition			1
‘ what we observed was that stress worsens the performance of men in all three types of tasks			2
the opposite is true for women ’ dr @entity29 said			0
the researchers were surprised to find that only men become more self - centred under stress			1
they created ' conditions of moderate stress ' in a laboratory by forcing participants to take mental arithmetic tests ( illustrated ) and make a speech to come to their conclusion the researchers are not sure why this happens but said they might try and find possible explanations in subsequent studies			1
‘ at a psychosocial level , women may have internalised the experience that they receive more external support when they are able to interact better with others , ’ dr @entity29 said			2
‘ this means that the more they need help - and are thus stressed - the more they apply social strategies ’ dr @entity29 said that at a physiological level , the gender difference might be accounted for by the oxytocin system			2
‘ oxytocin is a hormone connected with social behaviours and a previous study found that in conditions of stress women had higher physiological levels of oxytocin than men , ’ she added			1
the old saying ' a problem shared is a problem halved ' may have been based on scientific fact , according to a study published in january			0
researchers from @entity166 have proved that the best way to beat stress is to share your feelings - and sharing with someone in the same situation yields the best results			2
this is because sharing a threatening situation with a person in a similar emotional state ' buffers individuals from experiencing the heightened levels of stress that typically accompany threat , ' claimed the study			0
a total of 52 female undergraduates were paired up and asked to make a speech while being taped by researchers from the @entity187 @entity186			0
prior to each speech , participants were encouraged to discuss how they felt about public speaking with the researchers , and their fellow participants			0
other participants were told not to discuss their feelings			0
levels of the stress hormone cortisol were measured before , during and after each participant 's speech			0
the researchers found that stress levels were significantly reduced when the participants were able to vocalise how they felt about the speeches			1
this was most noticeable when the discussion was had with a fellow participant , in which they shared a common fear .			0

researchers from the @entity56 of @entity57 , @entity58 , found men find it hard to understand people 's emotions under stress
they said that women become more ‘ prosocial ’ and *sympathetic* under stress - perhaps because they are able to communicate their feelings
scientists made study participants take maths tests and make speeches to put them under ' moderate ' stress
