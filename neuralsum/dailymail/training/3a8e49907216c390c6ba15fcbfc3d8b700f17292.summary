after two years of turmoil , rebellion and bitter conflict , a new era of @entity2 rugby is about to begin			1
on thursday night , @entity7 and @entity8 launch the @entity9 and then on friday night at @entity10 , the main event begins when @entity11 take on @entity12 in the @entity13			1
for all the angst and animosity that so nearly led to the collapse of continental competition , there is a sense of familiarity about the tournaments that have hastily emerged from the wreckage			2
representatives of the @entity25 clubs competing for the new @entity13 , which starts on friday - ( from left ) @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , @entity28 ( @entity11 ) , @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) reduction from six pools to five with the three best runners - up qualifying for last eight knockout phase			1
qualification now solely dependent on league position with winners this year not guaranteed a spot next year			2
no drop - down qualification from main competition to the @entity9			1
tournament will be televised on @entity50 and @entity51 following a lucrative new television deal			2
asked on wednesday if the revamped competition feels much different from its predecessor , the @entity55 , @entity36 ’s @entity25 flanker , @entity54 , said : ‘ no , not at all			1
it feels exactly the same			2
it does n’t change anything - we prepare the same , it ’s still a great competition and it ’s still a long old haul to get here			0
’ in terms of front - of - house alterations , there are now 20 teams involved in five pools , rather than the old format of 24 sides in six pools , which should - in principle - lead to a strengthening of the pool stages , now that some of the weakest links have been removed			2
the tournament ’s greater meritocracy is a definite plus point			0
‘ this competition is meant to be an elite competition and it certainly has the feel of that this season , ’ said @entity77 , the director of rugby at @entity32 - who have been the @entity80 ’s standard - bearers in @entity81 in recent seasons			1
they are bracing themselves for a pool of staggering quality			0
@entity36 flanker @entity54 says the new competition name wo n't change anything for the players @entity96 's @entity95 flanker @entity94 ( left ) makes a destructive run in last year 's @entity55 final the last time the @entity55 was won by an @entity95 side was on may 20 , 2007 when @entity27 beat @entity30 25 - 9 in front of 81,076 fans at @entity102			1
@entity27 captain @entity103 ( centre ) leads celebrations with his team - mates at @entity102 ‘ ourselves , @entity107 and @entity108 were in the semi-finals last year and the year before , so we know it ’s going to be incredibly difficult to get through the group , ’ @entity77 added			1
‘ last year , we got a more favourable group and there was an expectation that we would get into the quarter - finals			0
this year , it would be an achievement in itself to get through the pool			0
’ @entity34 are back at the top table after years among the second tier in the @entity9			1
their form suggests they can mount a compelling quest to reach the quarter - finals , but captain @entity33 knows they have their hands full against @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 in @entity131			0
‘ the way the competition is set up , teams qualify on merit so you ’ve got the 20 best teams in @entity81 , ’ said the lock			1
‘ with the @entity140 teams in our group , you ’re going to come up against some of the best players in the world			0
’ the @entity95 clubs may soon recognise the wisdom of the old adage — be careful what you wish for			0
@entity80 led the @entity140 breakaway in order to secure wide - ranging reforms of the @entity2 game , but the immediate up - shot is that they may find it even harder to make their mark in the leading tournament			1
while the inaugural @entity13 represents a fresh start , the backdrop has not radically shifted			1
the new format with 20 teams instead of 24 ensures the best sides in @entity81 are going head - to - head , says @entity32 director of rugby @entity77 , who led @entity166 and his side to last year 's @entity55 final @entity140 clubs have the biggest budgets and therefore the greatest depth of players , but what they do n’t necessarily have across the board is extreme motivation			1
some @entity177 sides will once again react to early defeats by sending out weakened line - ups and focusing on domestic matters			0
one reason for @entity95 struggles in recent times has been the impact of the @entity185 , based on careful management of their players , in order to peak for these @entity2 windows			0
now that qualification reform has put a greater emphasis on @entity196 results , @entity191 , @entity108 and @entity192 may have to work their stars harder , which may undermine their continental prospects			0
@entity13 's @entity196 representatives ( left to right ) @entity200 ( @entity201 ) , @entity202 ( @entity192 ) , @entity203 ( @entity191 ) , @entity204 ( @entity108 ) , @entity205 , @entity206 ( @entity128 ) , @entity207 ( @entity208 ) and @entity209 ( @entity210 ) at the competition 's launch in @entity213 to take an example from each province , @entity214 has played just three full @entity196 games for @entity108 so far this season , but @entity203 and @entity202 have each made four starting appearances and one off the bench for @entity191 and @entity192 respectively			1
@entity221 hopes seemingly rest with the @entity210 , who are the only unbeaten team in @entity81			2
there are just two regions involved this time and one side from each of @entity228 and @entity229			0
the standards may rise , but the lack of variety will be most keenly felt in three pools featuring two teams from the same nation			2
sale v @entity32 , @entity27 v @entity11 and @entity130 v @entity129 lack the novelty value of classic @entity2 fixtures			1
still , the @entity13 promises to be fascinating			2
it has been a mad rush to put arrangements in place and there will be a period of transition behind the scenes , but the hope must be that the new era delivers the glorious drama that the @entity55 became adored for			0
@entity249 classic pool of death , containing three of last season ’s semi-finalists			0
@entity107 have the players , pedigree and home fortress to top the pile , but @entity32 have the depth and belief to run them close			2
@entity108 are dangerous in @entity261 but not the force of old			0

prediction @entity268 ( to qualify ) 2 @entity32 3 @entity108 4 sale @entity107 flanker @entity270 ( right ) @entity191 are favourites on reputation , having won the title three times in the last six years , but they no longer have @entity275 ’s reassuring presence and they ’re not yet in top gear			1
resurgent @entity27 will believe they can edge out @entity11 to finish as runners - up , while @entity12 are likely to be pre-occupied with a misfiring league campaign			1

however , their defeat in @entity288 last season shows that they are vulnerable in the group phase			0
@entity30 are undermined by injuries , so @entity192 are likely to provide the primary threat to @entity96 , while the @entity201 may lack the all - round power			1

@entity130 are the @entity2 aristocrats seemingly in decline , but they swept aside @entity96 last weekend , to provide impetus			2
@entity128 are riding high in the @entity196 , while @entity34 and @entity129 lie fourth in @entity25 and @entity308 respectively			2
@entity34 have the firepower , and confidence to finish first in this tricky group			2
