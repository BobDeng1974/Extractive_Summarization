last updated at 3:31 pm on 19th july 2011 cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in @entity5 colonies in @entity6 , a study out of @entity9 shows			1
the @entity5 , many of them from @entity12 or @entity9 , have set up 10 new settlements in @entity6 since 2010 - growth that doubles other states			1
that population has grown by nearly a third in two years , to 13,000			2
amish communities are currently in 28 @entity20 states , but more communities are popping up in @entity6 over the last few years the first @entity5 districts were established in the @entity23 in 1949 , but in - migration slowed until about 10 years ago			1
as recently as 1991 , there were just 3,900 @entity5 in the state			2
@entity28 professor @entity27 , who directed the study , said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land			0
factors such as weather , growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom			0
in the 1980s and 90s @entity38 played that role for the @entity5 , while more recently it was @entity41 , mr @entity27 said			1
@entity6 has lower land prices in rural areas than @entity9 and @entity12 , states that together account for about half of the @entity20 @entity5 population			1
@entity6 also has more areas of rural isolation , according to mr @entity27			2
' if you want to get away from the suburbs and the high - tech world , there are more places to hide in @entity6			2
' @entity6 , @entity38 , @entity55 and @entity56 have experienced the largest net gain in @entity5 households since 2006 , the study found			1
the largest net losers were @entity9 , @entity41 , @entity60 and @entity12 , although states with large @entity5 populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children			1
the @entity5 emigrated to @entity9 from @entity65 and @entity66 about 300 years ago			1
today , the nationwide @entity5 population totals about 261,000			1
nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago			0
' @entity70 ' : an @entity5 man works in the field in @entity73 , @entity6 , a town with an established @entity5 community			1
while their @entity77 beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement , or from church to church , they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse - and - buggy transportation , and speak a dialect of @entity87 or @entity65 @entity88			0
mr @entity27 said : ' it 's remarkable that a horse - and - buggy people like the @entity5 are thriving in the midst of high - tech , @entity92			2
' some areas of concentrated @entity5 populations in @entity9 , including @entity96 , have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the @entity5 way of life , so they make the decision to hire a tractor - trailer and head for someplace more remote			1
large @entity5 families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations , while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules , said @entity115 , an anthropology professor at the @entity116 at @entity117			2
ms @entity115 , whose book on the state 's @entity5 was published last year , said : ' the @entity5 moving to @entity6 are going to be , for the most part , very conservative			1
that means they 're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in			0
' the @entity5 have been involved in disputes in @entity6 over zoning , construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes , while some areas have capitalized on local @entity5 communities for tourism purposes			1
ms @entity115 said some new @entity5 arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century			0
' the families farming those farms are ready to retire and there are n't any young people ready to take the farm over , so you sell to the @entity5 , ' she said			0
' they 're revitalising farming , i would say , in many of those areas			0
' mr @entity27 said @entity5 migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises			0
it can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts , for example , he said			0
other @entity5 migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time			0
mr @entity27 said prime farmland in @entity96 currently costs about $ 15,000 an acre , a daunting challenge for a young farmer , along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment			0
that makes land prices of $ 2,000 an acre in other states very attractive			0
@entity9 had the nation 's largest @entity5 population in the new survey , just over 61,000 , with @entity12 a close second , about 400 people behind			1
@entity172 ranked third , 46,000 , @entity41 fourth , 16,000 , and @entity6 fifth			0
@entity174 : @entity175 shows new @entity5 communities in @entity6			2

@entity5 population in @entity6 has grown by a third in the past two years
the @entity180 are currently in 28 @entity20 states and @entity182
@entity9 had the largest @entity5 population , with @entity12 a close second .
@entity6 , @entity38 , @entity55 and @entity56 have the largest net gain in @entity5 households since 2006 .
