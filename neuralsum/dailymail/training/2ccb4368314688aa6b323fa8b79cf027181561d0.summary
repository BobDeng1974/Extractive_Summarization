@entity0 has claimed he has already been interviewed for the vacant post as manager of @entity3			1
club directors are still to talk to a number of candidates next week , including frontrunner @entity7 , @entity8 and caretaker boss @entity9 who has now indicated he would like to be considered			1
on friday , a club source cast doubt on @entity0 's claims but , as @entity15 first revealed , the former @entity11 international , 39 , is the choice of an @entity18 - based consortium to take the reins at @entity20 should they gain control			1
the @entity22 are the preferred saviours of former chairman @entity24			2
still short of the £ 800,000 they need to purchase the owner ’s 70 per cent stake , however , @entity0 is waiting by his phone for further news after insisting he held talks last month			1
former @entity31 winger @entity0 , claims he has been interviewed for the vacant @entity3 post and the @entity31 legend , who quit his post as technical director of @entity36 in august , says he is desperate for a crack at @entity39 football under new @entity41 owners			1
last night he told @entity15 : ‘ i went to see @entity3 play against @entity42 five weeks ago , had an interview after that and since then i have n’t heard anything else			2
‘ as people probably know , the new prospective owner has not been able to complete a deal yet			2
‘ for me at the minute there is lots of talking , but there are a lot of things to be done before they take over			2
they do n’t have 100 per cent ownership of the club			1
‘ the people concerned are from @entity18			1
i do n’t know them especially well and i ca n’t tell you their names , but i know them through some friends of mine			2
‘ there is no deadline and i do n’t know when or if they will complete			0
because they are not from here it obviously takes a little longer			0
@entity0 spent eight years with @entity31 over two spells and also played for @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 ‘ but from what i know they want to move the club forward , to challenge and finish in the top four consistently			1
‘ to try to qualify for @entity70 and build up an academy with good young lads from all over the world , not just @entity41			0
‘ they want to be a club which provides a window for the world			1
not just from @entity41 – if there are good young @entity39 lads with potential they will get a chance as well			0
’ currently based in @entity83 , @entity0 previously coached at @entity84 and @entity85 in his native @entity11 before his brief spell in @entity87			1
a former team - mate of @entity89 at @entity90 , he joined @entity31 when @entity91 was manager and says he has no concerns about moving to @entity39			1
the former @entity11 international , in action against @entity18 , left his post as technical director of @entity36 ‘ i am told @entity3 are interviewing four or five other coaches for the job as well			1
‘ but i have been following them closely in the last few games and will be watching them again against @entity103 tomorrow on television			0
‘ it ’s a job i am very interested in and i have to be fully prepared in case the call comes at any moment			0
‘ they are struggling to win games now , but there are two or three teams like @entity113 in the same situation so i am confident that if i can get the job i can get some players who can make them a winning team			0
‘ the priority is to keep them in the @entity120 and build up from there			0
’ former @entity122 boss @entity7 could move back to @entity3 where he managed between 2002 - 06 former well manager @entity7 is the latest frontrunner for the post , but caretaker @entity9 has now thrown his hat into the ring , too , after appearing initially reluctant to do so following @entity128 ’s resignation			2
the club ’s general manager @entity129 told the @entity131 : ‘ we thought initially @entity9 was not interested in the position but @entity9 and i had a conversation on thursday and he said that he was keen to be considered			2
so @entity9 will be spoken to			0
’ meanwhile , @entity9 , who has won one and lost two of the games in which he has been in temporary charge , said he expected a clear - out if @entity0 comes in under a @entity41 regime			1
‘ i think we all know that if it ’s the foreign route then the minute that was confirmed you could be packing your bags , ’ he said			0
‘ they bring their own people in			0
’ a former @entity146 coach under @entity147 , @entity9 is wary of the impact foreign owners have had on some @entity39 clubs , adding : ‘ we have seen it happen at @entity152 , at @entity153 , at @entity146			0
i certainly would not like to see it happen here			0
‘ we are a little bit unsure of what is going to happen , but what better chance tomorrow than a game against @entity103 to get talking about football again ? ’ @entity8 guided @entity159 to @entity161 glory over @entity103 in 2012 @entity3 caretaker boss @entity9 hopes he has proved enough that he is capable of the job			0
