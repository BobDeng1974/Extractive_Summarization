scientists have been asked to study the dna of @entity3 school killer @entity2 to see if has an ' evil ' gene that led him to carry out the massacre			1
the study , which will look at any abnormalities or mutations in his individual dna , is believed to be the first of its kind ever carried out on a mass murderer			1
@entity2 slaughtered 20 children and six adults in one of @entity18 's worst ever school shootings on december 14 , 2012			1
the massacre prompted president @entity31 to look into new gun controls and banning assault rifles such as @entity34 used by @entity2 in his rampage			2
the study of the killer 's dna has been ordered by @entity29 medical examiner h. @entity39 who carried out the post mortems on all the victims			1
he has contacted geneticists at @entity46 's to conduct the study			2
@entity2 slaughtered 20 children and six adults in one of @entity18 's worst ever school shootings the week before @entity50 home : @entity3 kept her weapons in an unlocked closet at her home , where she was shot dead by her own son before the @entity3 killings mother : despite concerns over her son 's mental state , @entity3 reportedly kept her guns - about a dozen in total - in an unlocked closet geneticists said they are likely looking at @entity2 's @entity10 to detect a mutation or abnormality that could increase the risk of aggressive or violent behavior			1
they could analyse @entity2 's entire genome in great detail and try to find any unexpected mutations			0
@entity74 , a professor at @entity75 , said the @entity46 geneticists are most likely trying to ' detect clear abnormalities of what we would call a mutation in a gene '			0
he added : ' @entity83 gene abnormalities and there are some abnormalities that are related to aggressive behavior			0
' they might look for mutations that might be associated with mental illnesses and ones that might also increase the risk for violence			0
@entity74 , who is also the chairman of @entity75 's department of molecular and human genetics in @entity95 , @entity92 said geneticists should be doing this type of research because there are ' some mutations that are known to be associated with at least aggressive behavior if not violent behavior			0
' ' i do n't think any one of these mutations would explain all of ( the mass shooters ) , but some of them would have mutations that might be causing both schizophrenia and related schizophrenia violent behavior , ' @entity74 said			2
' i think we could learn more about it and we should learn more about it			0
' dr. @entity114 , who autopsied the body of the gunman @entity2 , said a basic examination of @entity119 s brain showed nothing unusual horror : traumatized students are led out of @entity3 by authorities after the school massacre @entity74 , who is chairman of the @entity75 department of molecular and human genetics , said studying the genes of murderers is controversial because there is a risk that those with similar genetic characteristics could possibly be discriminated against or stigmatized			1
but he said the research into @entity133 would be helpful even if only a " fraction " may have the abnormality or mutation			0
' not all of these people will have identifiable genetic abnormalities , ' @entity74 told @entity140 in @entity18			2
' by studying genetic abnormalities we can learn more about conditions better and who is at risk and what might be dramatic treatments , ' @entity74 said , adding if the gene abnormality is defined the ' treatment to stop ' other mass shootings or ' decrease the risk is much approved			1
' police have so far failed to find a motive for @entity2 going on the deadly rampage			0
although known to be shy and social inept @entity133 had not shown any violent streak although he was known to spend hours in the basement of his home playing violent video games			0
his mental condition may also have been affected by his 52 year old mum who was a ' prepper ' and had stockpiled food and guns in readiness for a disaster			0
a six year old @entity166 boy , @entity3 , was among the young victims gunned down the week before @entity50			1
first - grader @entity168 and his sister , fourth - grader @entity169 , wait outside @entity3 after a shooting			1

the study will be the first one of its kind and will *evaluate* any genetic evidence for the mass killing of 20 first graders , six *members* of staff at @entity3 and his own mother .
