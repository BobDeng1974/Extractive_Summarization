@entity0 has described how the death of his uncle last month will inspire him to dethrone @entity4 middleweight king @entity3 when they clash in @entity6 on april 11			1
with the @entity9 's dad in prison , uncle @entity7 had been @entity0 's father figure until he lost his fight with cancer five weeks ago			1
undefeated ' @entity14 ' was already a week into his camp in preparation to fight @entity3 and , on the advice of his family , he did not break ranks in order to attend his uncle 's funeral			1
former middleweight world champion @entity0 action against @entity24 last year but @entity0 says he was inspired by the visit he made to be by his uncle 's side just a week before he died and has warned @entity3 that he is ' highly motivated ' for this fight as a result of it			1
the 31 - year - old said : ' he was the most important person to me in my whole life and it 's the first time i 've ever lost anybody that close to me			2
' when i saw him fighting on his deathbed with cancer , i saw him fight through that until he had nothing left in the tank to fight with			0
' that showed me the fight is all in your head			0
there 's no cancer here so i have to do what 's worth while i 'm still here on this earth			1
' i could n't attend his funeral because i was here in camp			1
when i saw him it was the week before i started camp and the week after he died			1
my family told me he would 've wanted me to stay in camp			0
i knew he was proud of me			0
' @entity0 is facing @entity3 for the title the @entity62 won by stopping highly - fancied @entity63 in @entity64 last december			1
@entity0 recently lost his uncle after a battle with cancer but did not interrupt his training to attend the funeral that night , the pair clashed for the vacant title because @entity0 vacated instead of facing @entity63 , who had been made his mandatory challenger			1
as such , the @entity73 , who is of @entity76 descent , did not lose his title in the ring but insists he no longer feels like the champion			2
he added : ' i 'm going to let @entity3 have the pressure on him to perform like the champion			1
i had that pressure but now i have pressure of being a challenger			0
' @entity3 and @entity0 almost crossed swords three years ago when a fight at @entity87 was mooted as part of the bill on which @entity90 faced @entity91 at @entity87			1
now they will finally meet , across @entity9 at the @entity93 , and @entity3 recalled why the fight never happened in 2012			2
he said : ' i remember when it was proposed at the the time , [ former trainer ] @entity96 [ @entity97 ] turned the fight down because he felt it should have been me fighting @entity91 instead of @entity90			0
' on top of that they put me in the fight with @entity0 on the undercard			2
they wanted me and @entity0 to have the hard fight			2
@entity3 won his middleweight world title by beating @entity63 in @entity64 last december @entity3 celebrates winning his world title ' now you have two big middleweights , big for the weight , two genuine punchers and two very good boxers			1
we match well and it will come down to whoever implements their plan better on the night			0
we have a plan and we 're working on it			0
' in @entity3 's last two victories – the win over @entity121 and the @entity123 contender against @entity124 in june – the 30 - year - old from @entity126 has been behind on the scorecards but turned the fight on its head with a single shot			1
but @entity3 added : ' at no time in those fights did i feel i was going to lose			2
i knew at some stage we would have to trade			0
with the power i carry i know we will have to trade in a 12 - round fight and i just know if i land at the right time with my power i can knock anybody out			0
' it gives you confidence			0
people got the wrong impression as a blood and guts fighter but i 'm a technical boxer			0
' that technique , as ever , is being honed under the tutelage of @entity147 in their training base in @entity150 in the south of @entity152			0
they operate within walking distance of one of the world 's biggest gambling districts in @entity158 and @entity3 recognises that the stakes could not be higher in @entity6 next month			1
he said : ' i could 've fought in @entity161 , chosen the opponent and beaten someone comfortably for my first defence			0
but if i fight and beat @entity0 in @entity9 i will be a global star			2
people will need to acknowledge what i 've been doing			0
it 's a great opportunity to fight in @entity73 , on national tv and it takes me to the next level			2
