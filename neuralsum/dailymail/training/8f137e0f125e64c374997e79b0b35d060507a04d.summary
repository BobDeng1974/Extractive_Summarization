by @entity0 yesterday , @entity2 's chips announced their four new wacky flavors , as voted for by consumers for its annual @entity6 contest			1
the bonkers range includes @entity8 , @entity10 , and most confoundingly of all , @entity7 flavored chips			0
@entity12 were quick to get our greedy mits on all four of them , to see if we could predict which one would reign supreme			0
the line - up : for this year 's @entity6 contest , @entity2 's have announced four new flavors - @entity20 , @entity21 cooked @entity22 , @entity23 , and most confoundingly of all , @entity7 a quick glance at the facial expressions of our testers indicated that two flavors in particular were causing a bit of a raucous - and not in a good way			1
the @entity10 chips were wrong on every level ; overpoweringly fruity , described by one staffer as ' like eating lip balm , ' and loathed by everyone else who had the misfortune of trying them			0
potentially even more horrific however , was the @entity7 flavor , which amassed only two fans ; both of whom were widely attacked by the rest of us for their ill - judgement			2
losers : the @entity10 's fruity flavor ( left ) did not go down well with any of our testers , while the sickly sweet - caffeine - free - @entity7 version ( right ) caused an uproar of disgust ' it 's sweet , but it 's a chip ! i hate it ! ' cried out one tester			1
' i ca n't even put that in my mouth , ' claimed another , upon giving the open bag a whiff			0
' it 's sweet , but it 's a chip ! i hate it ! ' thick with the taste of cinnamon and more sugary than a traditionally savory snack should ever be , at least one tester spat theirs out			2
the @entity22 flavor divided us			2
obviously if you are not a fan of wasabi , this is not the chip for you			0
but i found them to be tangy , citrussy and delicious - and probably the most innovate flavor pairing			0
winners : the @entity80 chips were praised for their innovative balance of sushi - inspired flavors , while the @entity83 were enjoyed by everyone for being the safest , least - peculiar of them all which makes the @entity20 flavor the winner of @entity12 's road test			1
perhaps for being the safest option , it was praised for its reassuringly familiar smoky bacon taste , and found itself not a single hater			0
the person who invented the most popular flavor will win @entity2 's @entity6 a flavor contest , and bag themselves a whopping $ 1million			1
all four flavors will be hitting stores later this month and people can vote for their favorite online through october 18 .			1

the four flavors are the *finalists* in @entity2 's ' annual @entity6 contest
consumers can vote for their favorite online , and the inventor of the most popular flavor wins $ 1million
