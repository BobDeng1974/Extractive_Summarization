more than 600,000 white @entity1 londoners have left the capital in a decade			1
census figures show that between 2001 and 2011 the level of ‘ white flight ’ reached 620,000			1
it is the equivalent of a city the size of @entity9 – made up entirely of white @entity10 – moving out of the capital			1
@entity10 are now a minority in the country 's capital with 620,000 leaving in a decade the figures , reported by the @entity15 yesterday , mean that for the first time , white @entity10 are now in a minority in the country ’s largest city			1
at the same time , the census shows , some rural areas have seen a rise in the proportion of people who describe their ethnicity as ‘ white @entity1 ’			2
some 3.7million @entity0 classified themselves as white @entity1 in 2011 – down from 4.3million in 2001 – despite the city ’s population increasing by nearly one million over the decade to 8.2million			2
sir @entity28 of @entity29 thinks that the @entity15 should have addressed such a serious issue less trivially @entity10 now make up 45 per cent of the population , compared with 58 per cent in 2001			1
@entity33 ’s population has been boosted by immigrants			2
three million foreign - born people now live in the capital			2
five @entity33 boroughs saw the proportion of white @entity10 fall by more than a quarter			1

sir @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29 think - tank , said : ‘ the @entity15 make a very serious mistake in addressing an issue of such importance to the @entity1 public in such a trivial and superficial manner			0
‘ it ’s surely obvious that the main reason for white flight is because people are not willing to live in an environment which has changed beyond recognition and against their own wishes			0
’ @entity79 , a @entity80 councillor in @entity42 and @entity43 , said : ‘ i think people left for a variety of reasons			0
‘ if you look back to the early 2000s many people were able to retire to @entity86 and they saw their friends going and followed			0
‘ but people also watched all this demographic change going on between 2000 and 2010 and they thought , “ we do n’t know where we are living any more ”			0
‘ one day they are in a place that they think is @entity45 and then they are living in another place			0
‘ it has never been an issue of race			0
it ’s about the inability of people to affect change			0
the world was changing around them and they could n’t do anything about it			0
