an over-the - counter painkiller used by millions will no longer be sold in pharmacies from today , over fears that it could raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
diclofenac pills will now only be available with a prescription			2
the @entity9 said the painkilling and anti-inflammatory tablets , widely bought under the brand name @entity13 , carry a ‘ small but increased ’ risk of heart problems			1
@entity13 , an anti-inflammatory drug , has been reclassified by the @entity18 healthcare regulator as a prescription - only medicine after concerns it may cause heart problems for some patients painkilling gels that contain diclofenac will still be available over the counter , however			1
@entity13 accounts for six million prescriptions , and it is thought that tens of thousands buy @entity13 directly over the counter			1
the pills are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( @entity31 ) , which are used to relieve pain caused by conditions including arthritis , gout , headaches and flu			1
in 2013 , @entity39 researchers found high doses of @entity31 can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes			2
a review by @entity46 health officials confirmed the finding , and said patients should no longer use diclofenac if they have a heart condition , or have previously suffered heart attacks or strokes			2
@entity13 - the active ingredient in @entity13 – offers fast relief from pain and inflammation associated with back , neck and muscle aches			1
it also gives short - term relief from headaches , toothache , period pain and cold and flu symptoms			0
it blocks a substance in the body called cyclo - oxygenase , which produces chemicals in response to injury – causing pain , swelling and inflammation			0

@entity13 can also cause serious side - effects in the gut , such as ulceration , bleeding or perforation of the stomach or intestinal lining			1
the @entity9 ’s @entity82 concluded that these side - effects could ‘ not be ruled out ’ even at lower doses , or when diclofenac is taken for a short time			0
pills containing diclofenac remain available over the counter in many other countries , including @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
however , the @entity9 ’s @entity91 said : ‘ @entity13 is associated with a small but increased risk of serious cardiac side effects in some patients , particularly if used at high doses and for long - term treatment			1
because of this , the @entity82 has advised that patients need to have a medical review before taking oral diclofenac to make sure it is suitable for them			0
‘ if patients have recently bought diclofenac tablets and continue to need pain relief they should talk to their pharmacist about suitable alternative treatments			0
’ dr @entity108 said those prescribed diclofenac by a doctor should continue to take their medicine as instructed , as their medical history has already been assessed			0
dr @entity115 , head of clinical safety at @entity13 manufacturer @entity117 , warned : ‘ those who want to continue taking oral diclofenac are now going to have to go to their gp which , in view of the current situation in the @entity18 with @entity124 , is worrying			2
