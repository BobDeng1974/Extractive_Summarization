the @entity0 said on thursday it is too early to say that the @entity3 - led coalition is ' winning ' against @entity4 , pointing to the group 's continued access to financing , volunteers and weapons even after being bombed in @entity10 and @entity11			1
' your question gets at ... how do you know you 're winning ? and what i 'm telling you is , it 's going to take us a while to be able to say that , ' @entity0 spokesman rear admiral @entity19 told reporters			0
' even after the hits they 've taken and they have been hit ... they still have financing at their fingertips			0
they still have plenty of volunteers			0
they still have plenty of weapons and vehicles and the ability to move around , ' he said			0
ready for the long haul : @entity0 press secretary @entity19 ( @entity37 ) speaks during a briefing at the @entity0 in @entity39 the @entity3 and its allies are steeling themselves for what an @entity3 defense official described as a yearslong fight against the so - called @entity4 @entity3 - led airstrikes hit locations overnight in a remote area of eastern @entity10 where @entity47 has been using mobile refineries to produce oil that brings in up to $ 2 million a day for the group earlier this week , @entity3 aircraft , accompanied by planes from @entity54 allies , began striking @entity4 targets in @entity10 , marking an expansion of the @entity3 air campaign against the militant group that began last month in neighboring @entity11			1
on wednesday , the @entity3 military announced strikes on small oil refineries in eastern @entity10 intended to undermine the group 's ability to finance itself through oil sales			1
@entity19 said the @entity3 had not seen movement of troops loyal to @entity10 president @entity67 , who remains an illegitimate leader in @entity70 eyes , into areas of @entity10 where @entity4 had been hit by @entity3 and allied air strikes			1
' we 've also seen ... to be quite honest ... much in terms of reaction by ( @entity4 ) inside @entity10 as a result of these attacks			2
in other words , they 're not seeing a lot of movement or major muscle movement changes by them in just the last couple of days			0
' for now , the @entity3 is focused on the refineries , according to @entity19			1
but he acknowledged there are ' other economic levers the international community is going to have to pull ' to cut off all funding to @entity47 @entity19 said @entity3 officials were working to establish whether civilians had been killed or injured in the recent strikes			1
' we are aware of some reporting out there that there may have been civilian casualties , and we 're taking a look at that , ' he said			0
' i would add , though , not as a caveat , but just to be completely transparent , we do n't have any credible operational reporting through operational channels that would sustain those allegations			0
' in a @entity0 briefing yesterday , @entity106 lieutenant general @entity105 called the cruise missiles and bombs flung at targets in @entity10 ' the beginning of a credible and sustainable persistent campaign			2
' how long will the campaign last ? ' i would think of it in terms of years , ' @entity105 responded			0
although the bombs exploded on @entity10 soil , they did n't target @entity67 's battered , murderous regime			2
the bombs were addressed to @entity10 's enemy , the @entity4 , a nascent nation that has pledged to topple both @entity11 and @entity10 , as well as @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , and parts of southern @entity125 , and erect a caliphate on the parcel			2
but in attacking @entity10 's enemy , the @entity3 was n't looking to make friends with @entity10			1
president @entity130 called for @entity67 to step down in 2011 , and it was only last year that the @entity3 was prepared to bomb @entity10 for having crossed the chemical - weapons ' red line ' to kill its own citizens			1
not that the @entity3 is remarkably choosey about which nations it counts among its allies			2
@entity3 president @entity130 and senior advisers meet with representatives from the five @entity54 countries plus @entity11 who have participated in air strikes against @entity47 in @entity10 in the latest round of strikes targeting @entity47 refineries in @entity10 , fighter jets from @entity144 and the @entity145 flew alongside @entity3 aircraft , hitting 12 locations among the @entity152 nations joining with the @entity3 to strike @entity10 is @entity153 , which has allowed one of its sheikhs to raise funds for an @entity158 affiliate in @entity10			1
the @entity3 is at war with @entity158 in all of its flavors , including the @entity10 - based @entity161 , upon which @entity3 bombs fell this week			1
the @entity161 is said to be plotting attacks on the @entity3 and @entity164			2
our perpetual war is complicated , however , by the fact that the @entity4 is the sworn enemy of @entity158 , from which it split earlier this year because it could n't play nice with @entity158 's other affiliate in @entity10 , @entity170 , which is also fighting the @entity67 regime			2
or , to look at it another way , the enemies of @entity3 's enemies are not automatically @entity3 's friends ; and even @entity3 's friends , which can be permissive about the flow of money to @entity158 , are n't necessarily @entity3 's friends either			2
@entity3 has allies in @entity10 's civil war , of course , including @entity184 , part of the @entity106			1
@entity184 is fighting @entity67 , but it has also fought alongside @entity3 's enemy @entity170 , which has not disqualified it from receiving @entity3 weapons and training			2
@entity184 took exception to the @entity3 - led bombing of @entity10 in a statement , calling it an ' external intervention ' and ' an attack on the revolution , ' according to a @entity196 report			1
so @entity184 , @entity3 's friend , which fought with @entity3 's enemy against @entity10 - which is neither friend nor enemy - objects to the fact that @entity3 bombed @entity10 in pursuit of the @entity4 , which is also @entity184 's enemy			1
meanwhile , the militant @entity204 group @entity203 is drone - bombing @entity205 along the @entity120 - @entity10 border at the same time @entity122 is downing @entity10 jets			1
as @entity105 promised , this conflict will likely go on for years			0
the attacks are focused on the ' infrastructure around the refineries , ' meaning the ability of @entity47 to produce oil there are questions about just how much impact the destruction of the refineries will have on @entity47 , which analysts have said has access to billions of dollars it 's a wild card war in which allies and enemies seem arbitrary and ever - shifting			1
a war with a conclusion that its participants ca n't see or ca n't imagine is a war without end			0
none of the dig - in parties in @entity10 and @entity11 look like pushovers , but neither do any of them look like sure bets			0
without @entity3 intervention , the current war will likely rage on			0
with regard to @entity3 intervention , not even the @entity0 dares to predict an end			0
for @entity3 , at least so far , this war is rumbling on like background noise			0
the usual markers of military victory - body - counts tabulated , territories seized and banked , no - fly zones established , governments - in - waiting imposed , and elections supervised - do n't apply to the @entity10 war			1
the borders , combatants , allegiances , and military objectives in the @entity10 war are too fluid to conform to our usual expectations			1
nor do the usual markers of peace seem to exist			0
there are no peace talks taking shape , no shuttle diplomacy , no evidence of a dominant power about to exert its might to create a lasting peace by flattening everybody			0
president @entity130 , who inherited this war , has made this war his war , the next president 's war and for as far as the eye can see			0
perpetual war for perpetual peace .			0
