by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 30 december 2013 updated : 03:16 est , 31 december 2013 @entity1 means something quite different for @entity4 coaches on the first day following the end of the regular season			2
five coaches have already been fired in a tradition known as @entity9 , as teams not progressing to the playoffs try to get a head start on next year			0
the head coaches of the the @entity18 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 have all been let go withing hours of the regular - season ending			1
first to go : the @entity16 got a head start on black monday by announcing the firing of head coach @entity22 late last night now unemployed : @entity15 head coach @entity24 ( left ) and @entity14 head coach @entity23 ( right ) were the first to be fired this morning as the @entity4 's struggling teams clear out the dismissals started early this year , with the news that the @entity16 would not be keeping coach @entity22 being released late last night			1
as monday morning dawned , two other coaches expected to be fired joined @entity29 on the unemployment line			0
the @entity15 fired head coach @entity24 and the @entity14 sacked head coach and executive vice president @entity23			1
@entity23 was among those expected to be out of the job for the way he dealt with quarterback @entity38 's acl injury last season			1
bad move : @entity14 head coach @entity23 was expected to lose his job for the way he dealt with quarterback @entity38 's leg injury			1
above , @entity38 aggravated his injury in a game against the @entity46 last year instead of letting @entity38 recover from the injury , @entity23 put him back on the field after missing just one game			2
on january 6 , the @entity14 went up against the @entity46 in an @entity4 wild card game and @entity38 aggravated the injury , having to undergo surgery three days later			2
@entity38 was back playing this season but the leg injury seems to have slowed him down noticeably			0
by lunchtime in @entity55 , two other coaches had been fired : @entity56 of the @entity13 and @entity57 of the @entity18			1
surprising : @entity56 of the @entity13 ( left ) and @entity57 of the @entity18 ( right ) were also let go			1
@entity56 's dismissal was unexpected since an @entity4 insider previously tweeted that his job was safe @entity56 's firing was unexpected as @entity4 insider @entity62 tweeted yesterday that the @entity13 coach was safe			1
@entity13 general manager @entity64 was also let go			2
while five firings may seem relatively tame , the dismissals have impacts far beyond one man since it means their assistant coaches are also out of the job			0
but most wo n't be unemployed for long as they 'll get snapped up by one of the other now head coach-less teams			0
this quick turnover process helps the struggling teams get a fresh start on next year before the combine and draft			0
' everyone ’s in such a competitive environment , there ’s a race to get things done because there is the same group of candidates out there , ' former @entity89 general manager @entity88 told the @entity90			0
' it ’s to clear the decks and move on			0
' while it 's not certain when @entity9 officially became apart of the @entity4 culture , the @entity90 reports that it originated about 10 to 15 years ago around the time when sports channels switched to become 24 hour news sources .			0
