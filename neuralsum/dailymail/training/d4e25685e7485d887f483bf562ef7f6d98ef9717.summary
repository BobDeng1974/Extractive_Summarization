by @entity0 a woman who lost seven babies has finally become a mother after losing 17 stone			1
@entity5 , 35 , suffered five miscarriages , an ectopic pregnancy and a stillbirth after ballooning to 30 stone			1
she also had to deal with the emotional heartbreak of three failed marriages and turned to comfort eating to fill the void			1
but as her weight increased , her chances of a successful pregnancy grew increasingly unlikely			1
@entity5 , 35 , ballooned to 30st ( left ) after suffering five miscarriages , an ectopic pregnancy and a stillbirth			1
she had a gastric bypass on the @entity19 and lost 17st before having @entity20 ( right ) last year doctors eventually warned ms @entity5 her weight could kill her and she was given a gastric bypass on the @entity19			1
she lost 17 stone - over half her of her weight - and at a healthier 13st , she conceived for an eighth time and finally gave birth to daughter @entity20			1
ms @entity5 has just celebrated her little girl ’s first birthday - and because of her gastric band , now eats less than her baby			1
she said : ‘ i just ca n’t believe i ’ve finally got a little girl all of my own			0
it ’s all i ’ve ever wanted			0
‘ when i was young i did n’t want to be a princess or pop star - i just wanted to be a mum			2
‘ i gave up hope so many times and i never thought it was going to have a happy ending			0
‘ i was so depressed and miserable because i just wanted to be a mum , so i just stopped caring and started eating			2
ms @entity5 was told she was so overweight that she was risking her life - as well as her chance of motherhood ‘ it was horrible - i was at rock bottom			1
i had lost everything i ever wanted so many times			2
‘ many of my friends took pity on me and made me godmother to eight of their children to make me feel better			0
‘ i even became godmother to the kids of an @entity53 couple i met online			0
‘ but it did n’t help and in the end , i nearly gave up hope completely			0
’ ms @entity5 suffered her first miscarriage when she was just 17 and had another two in her early twenties after her marriage to her first husband , a bus driver , in 1999			1
about 15 to 20 per cent of pregnant women in the @entity62 are now overweight or obese			0
most manage to have a successful pregnancy			2
however , being overweight increases the risk of miscarriage , gestational diabetes , high blood pressure , blood clots and infection			0
it also increases the risk of haemorrhage , problems with breastfeeding and having a baby with an abnormally high birth weight			0
obese pregnant women are more likely to need an induction , an instrumental delivery - using forceps or ventouse - or a caesarean			2
their babies are more likely to be stillborn , to have birth defects and to have health problems later in life			0
source : @entity86 devastated by her loss , she started gorging and became a virtual recluse and her marriage ended two years later			2
she remarried in 2005 but then had two further miscarriages with her second husband , a warehouse worker , in 2006 and 2007			2
it was then doctors warned ms @entity5 her weight was making it harder to have a successful pregnancy			1
the worried medics also warned her obesity was putting strain on her heart and endangering her life			0
she underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2008 and became pregnant for a sixth time but lost that baby because of an ectopic pregnancy			1
she split from her second husband shortly after			0
a year later she married third husband @entity109 , 29 , and conceived for a seventh time in 2011			2
she went to full term but tragically little @entity112 was stillborn			0
by now ms @entity5 ’s weight was down to a healthy 13st and she was determined to make it eighth time lucky			1
@entity20 arrived healthily in january last year and ms @entity5 , of @entity115 , @entity116 , said : ‘ now she ’s a healthy , happy one - year - old and i have to pinch myself every day			1
‘ i still look at her when she ’s asleep in my arms and think : are you really here ? i ’m so happy			0
‘ she was worth all the heartbreak - every tear i cried and every sobbing sleepless night			2
i ’d go through it all again just to have @entity20			1
’ despite the joy of becoming a mother , ms @entity5 ’s third marriage has also ended in failure			1
ms @entity5 said : ' she was worth all the heartbreak - every tear i cried and every sobbing sleepless night			1
i 'd go through it all again just to have @entity20 ' midwife @entity131 , who is specialising in maternal obesity at @entity133 , said : ‘ there is a higher miscarriage rate of 13.6 per cent with obese women , compared to 10.7 per cent in women with a normal weight			1
‘ there is a link there and there are a number of working hypotheses as to why that is but at the moment no one can quite pinpoint it			0
‘ it will be said that there are a number of factors but there is no doubt being a heavier weight will have an effect			0
‘ it may well be to do with the fact obese women need a higher intake of folic acid and vitamin d but they are only advised to take the amount other women take			0
‘ it may also be that obese women ’s diets have an effect on the embryo			0
‘ i would advise women who are obese and want to have children to lose a bit of weight and try to look after their health			0
