but salvation may be on its way ... in the shape of a @entity12 vice city , that developers say will boost its flat - lining economy			1
dubbed ' @entity16 ' , it will house six casinos , 12 hotels , nine theatres and three golf courses , if @entity22 's eighth richest man gets his way			1
@entity24 , however , says he will only go ahead if @entity1 bends its rules on indoor smoking and caps on soaring skyscrapers			0
@entity1 's savior ? @entity22 's eighth richest man , tycoon @entity24 , is laying plans to pump $ 22 billion into the complex in either @entity32 or @entity33 @entity24 is laying plans to pump $ 22 billion into the complex , in @entity32 or @entity33			1
and his money could be just what @entity1 needs with its shrinking economy and rising unemployment figures			2
not everyone is thrilled about the idea of @entity1 hosting a @entity42 @entity41 that could attract prostitution and mafia gangs - and add gambling addiction to the woes of already desperate @entity1			2
pedigree : @entity24 already owns the @entity48 is shown in @entity49 still , @entity33 and @entity32 are both vying to woo @entity24 and the $ 22 billion he wants to invest to erect ' @entity16 ' - an array of six casinos , 12 hotels featuring 36,000 rooms , a convention center , three golf courses , shopping centers , bars and restaurants			1
the two sites being eyed in @entity33 each cover an area equivalent to 1,000 football fields			1
@entity24 and his company , @entity62 , will decide by the summer which city to build in if they reach a deal with @entity1 authorities			0

first - quarter gdp numbers are expected to show @entity1 has slipped into its second recession in three years			2
not on our doorstep ! an @entity77 association held a rally in @entity33 last week in which @entity24 was mocked as an economic messiah , his pockets overflowing with dollars ' at a time like this , with so little to boost the economy , something like this is like manna falling from heaven , ' said @entity88 , an economist who specializes in labor market issues at @entity90 in @entity33			1
@entity88 said that @entity1 is already a huge tourist draw , with its sunshine and great beaches , and a casino complex would build on those assets			2
@entity1 is regularly one of the world 's three most visited countries , along with the @entity22 and @entity99			0
critics argue @entity16 will bring more criminality to @entity1 just as the economy goes into a nose - dive			1
and they warn that while @entity1 's young people are in dire need of jobs , positions such as hotel maids , waiters and croupiers are not a recipe for success			0
@entity24 started looking at @entity1 as a possible site for a @entity42 gambling magnet in 2007 , but his propsals fell flat with the then - ruling @entity116			2
but since the more business - friendly @entity118 took power , along with the downturn , @entity24 's plans are said to be back on track			1
gambling is legal in @entity1			0
but its casinos , and others in @entity42 , are associated with a more snooty clientele and ambiance , not the festive , anything - goes atmosphere of @entity130			1
' there is no one place in @entity42 that is fun to go to and play the slots or play tables or have a good time with an adult couple or family , ' @entity24 said in a meeting with investors in @entity140 last september			0
the hotels and casinos and all the rest would be built in three phases over the course of 10 years			1

but nothing came of it			0
an @entity77 association held a rally in @entity33 last week in which @entity24 was mocked as an economic messiah , his pockets overflowing with dollars			2
@entity165 , a spokesman for the association , said a gambling haven is no answer to @entity1 's crisis			0
' i think a casino would be a waste of brain power and labor , and instead endorses an activity that has little do with research , innovation and development , ' @entity165 said .			0
