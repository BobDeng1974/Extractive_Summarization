gang members in @entity1 have admitted to massacring 43 students who went missing in september after the local mayor demanded they be ' taught a lesson ' so they did n't interrupt a speech by his wife			1
attorney general @entity7 said on friday that three detainees revealed that they set fire to the group - some of whom were still alive - at a rubbish dump near @entity14 in the state of @entity16 , close to where the students went missing			1
so far , 19 mass graves have been discovered around @entity14 and more than 70 people have been arrested			1
after the flames died down , it is claimed that gang members waded through the ashes to recover any bone or teeth which may have survived the intense heat			1
the 46 students have not been seen since they disappeared near the southern city of @entity14 on september 26 after being attacked by police			1
attorney general @entity47 said : ' the high level of degradation caused by the fire in the remains make it very difficult to extract the dna that will allow an identification			0
' the bone fragments are being sent to @entity55 to a specialist laboratory for dna testing			0
police allegedly handed the students over to the @entity61 cartel who are believed to have killed them and disposed of their bodies			1
@entity47 said there is no evidence the students were involved in organized crime			0
some 74 people have been detained so far in the case			0
authorities say it started when police , under orders of then @entity14 mayor @entity29 , opened fire on students who were in @entity14 collecting donations and had commandeered public buses			1
@entity29 , left and his wife @entity78 @entity31 are believed to have links to the drug cartel investigators believe the bodies of the 43 missing students were burned at this rubbish dump six people were killed in two confrontations before the 43 students were taken away and allegedly handed over to @entity61			1
@entity88 and his wife , who were captured tuesday after weeks of being on the run , are among those in custody			0
@entity29 , who was previously mayor of @entity14 , and his wife @entity30 @entity31 were found and arrested in @entity32 on monday			1
they are accused of organising the alleged massacre			0
concerned that the group were about to disrupt a speech to be given by his politically ambitious wife , @entity88 ordered police to ' teach them a lesson ' according to @entity1 media reports			1
@entity31 demanded that police arrest they students when they threatened to ruin a party she was having , and once the police had the students they were then handed over to the gang members			1
prior to this the police also opened fire on the group , killing several before the bodies were burned			0
attorney general @entity7 is seen leaving the prison after speaking with three gang members protesters walk with a sign featuring a photograph of the students @entity31 was able to make these demands as she is at the top of the criminal underworld tree in @entity14 , and it was believed her speech may have been her announcement of her desire to succeed her husband as mayor			1
what 's worse , the students had no intention of disrupting @entity31 's speech , but were merely travelling through the town on buses they 'd hired to take them to @entity32 for a remembrance service in honor of students massacred there in 1968			2
there has been and continues to be a massive outcry across @entity1 to see that justice is served for this mass murder			2
authorities searching for the students have found a large number of bodies , although attorney general @entity47 said he would have to wait until the results of dna tests have been returned before confirming their identities			2
he admitted that many of the bodies had been badly burned which will make the process of extracting dna more difficult			0
he said : ' i have to identify , to do everything in my power , to identify , to know if these were the students			0
' some parents of the missing students do not believe that their children are among the dead			0
@entity167 told @entity168 : ' we are not going to believe anything until the experts tell us : you know what ? it is them			0
' @entity176 , claimed : ' the government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing			0
' the victims were mostly in their 20s studying to be teachers when they planned to travel to @entity14 on september 26 for a demonstration			2
protesters have been holding regular demonstrations demanding the safe return of the missing students locals have lost faith in the @entity1 government and their ability to investigate incidents such as this some of the families are unwilling to accept that their relatives are dead until they receive conclusive proof @entity202 has criticised the attorney general over his handling of the case			2
@entity206 , @entity207 of @entity202 said : ' tragically , the enforced disappearance of these student teachers is just the latest in a long line of horrors to have befallen @entity16 state , and the rest of the country			0
' the warning signs of corruption and violence have been there for all to see for years , and those that negligently ignored them are themselves complicit in this tragedy			0
' @entity202 said the mayor of @entity14 has long been suspected of criminality and links to drugs cartels			2
ms @entity206 said : ' if the allegations against @entity14 â€™s mayor and the federal and local police had been investigated when other serious human rights violations occurred , it is more than likely that the terrible murders and enforced disappearances of the students would not have taken place			1
' @entity202 has criticised @entity1 authorities for their failure to clamp down on corruption			2
