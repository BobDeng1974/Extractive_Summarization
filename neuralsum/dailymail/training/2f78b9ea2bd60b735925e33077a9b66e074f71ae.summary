' i was surprised by his statement , ' @entity4 said			2
' i 'm sorry , because whenever there 's a separation it 's upsetting for everyone			0
but the serenity with which he made the announcement leads to believe that he 's mentally ready for this event			0
' @entity1 , whose personal life has been under an intense spotlight in recent weeks , told @entity21 he has been ' separated for a while ' from @entity23 model @entity22 , who he married three years ago			1
the couple has two boys			0

@entity1 thanked his wife for not creating any problems in public and apparently wanted to clarify his status after he and @entity22 were photographed at the @entity46 final with their children			1
' it was her who brought them to the stadium , ' @entity1 said			2
' and i would like for them to come to @entity54 - that would really please me			2
you ca n't ever forget that the first obligation we have is to make sure your kids grow up with the utmost serenity , no matter the fact that our roads could part			0
' @entity2 is training for three days this week before beginning full - time preparation next monday			2
with @entity4 concerned about humid conditions in @entity54 , players wore heart monitors around their chests as they trained under the sun at the @entity71 training center in @entity72			1
as for social networks , @entity4 said he would hold an open discussion with the squad to decide on how best to handle their use during the @entity7			1

tweet or sour ? @entity2 coach @entity4 will have a discussion over the use of social media at the @entity7 @entity87 - born forward @entity86 was included in @entity4 's preliminary 30 - man squad despite missing almost the entire second half of the @entity91 season due to the latest in a long string of knee injuries			1
' he 's a great talent and one of the most important players in the @entity98 landscape , ' @entity4 said			2
' his determination and desire to recuperate in time shows a lot of character			0
... of course he needs to work on his condition but i do n't want to put too much pressure on him			0
' @entity107 , another forward , is aiming to play in his first @entity7 at the age of 31			1
up front : forwards @entity110 ( c ) and @entity107 ( r ) could join @entity28 in @entity54 @entity107 was a key member of @entity2 's squads at the last three @entity112 but he was not a favorite of former coach @entity114 and was n't included on the 2006 and 2010 @entity7 teams			1
' he put himself back into consideration and that 's already a victory			0
it means he did everything right , " @entity4 said , referring to @entity107 's strong season with @entity122 , where he scored 12 goals			1
" and at that age this is probably his last big chance			0
' @entity4 raised eyebrows by leaving off physical forwards @entity127 and @entity129 from the squad			2
' we want to operate in a different manner inside the area , " he said			0

@entity4 was asked how important it was to start well against @entity141			1
' it 's easy to say a lot , for two reasons			0
because if you win you get three points that are key for advancing , and beating a big squad is good for the squad 's spirit , ' he said			0
' but history teaches us that at the last @entity7 , @entity155 lost ( its opener ) to @entity157 and went on to win the cup			2
but obviously we would prefer to start with a win			0
' @entity2 will play two friendlies before flying to @entity54 , facing @entity161 on may 31 in @entity162 and @entity163 on june 4 in @entity164 .			1
