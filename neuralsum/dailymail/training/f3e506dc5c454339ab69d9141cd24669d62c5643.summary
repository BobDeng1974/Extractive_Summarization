@entity0 , the day after @entity1 , is recognised as the launching pad for the @entity4 shopping season			1
it signifies an eruption of frantic excess , breathless extravagance and uncontrolled spending			1
this year , by happy coincidence , it was also the day on which the @entity12 published details of the money which each club handed to football agents in the previous 12 months			1
in 2012 , the leeches pocketed £ 77,003,130 in fees , and the amount provoked a degree of outrage			1
last year , their pickings had risen to £ 96,673,089 , and ‘ monstrous ’ was one of the favoured descriptions			1
we suspected that the year ending september 30 , 2014 , would break the nine - figure barrier , and our suspicions were well founded			1
@entity29 spent big in the summer on the likes of @entity31 but not on agents ' fees these sharp - suited , self - seeking , utterly superfluous hustlers extracted a total of £ 115,261,136 from the national sport			1
and gave it precious little in return			1
the headline figures are mind - numbing			1
@entity42 were top of the pile with a staggering £ 16,771,328 slice of their resident oligarch ’s fortune			1
@entity49 distributed £ 14,308,444 of @entity52 ’s @entity51 bounty			1
@entity54 ’s sheik , the chap with the bottomless purse , weighed in with £ 12,811,946			1
and the relentlessly unsuccessful @entity56 discovered £ 10,983,011 in their reclusive patron ’s back pocket			1
by comparison , @entity29 ( £ 7,975,556 ) were a model of moderation , while even @entity62 ’s £ 6,380,339 looks a shade less offensive than it did at first sight			1
@entity42 spent £ 32 million on @entity66 striker @entity65 in the summer no matter , the point is that 20 football clubs have passed over £ 115.2m which the game will never see again			1
it will purchase second homes , private education , exotic holidays and impossibly opulent motor cars for the aforementioned agents , but the game which generated those funds will receive not a penny			1
now you might think it impossible to make this unacceptable situation even worse , but the @entity12 seem to have worked the trick			1
in a helpful explanation attached to these financial details , they explain : ‘ the amounts shown include payments made by clubs on behalf of players			1
’ so the clubs have paid the fees which the players owe to their agents			1
effectively , they have rewarded agents for negotiating against them ! it is quite beyond reason or belief			1
when actors , authors or international sports people want to sell their services , they hire an agent to secure the best possible deal			1
in return , they pay that agent an agreed fee			1
they do not expect their prospective employers to meet the bill , since they live in the real world			1
yet football exists not only on a different planet , but in a different galaxy			1
agent @entity116 ( left ) was involved in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity65 deals the clear winner in this year ’s agents ’ handicap was the indefatigable @entity116 , whose portfolio includes @entity117 and @entity31 to @entity29 , @entity65 to @entity42 and @entity124 to @entity54			1
estimates of @entity116 ’ cut begin at £ 20m and keep climbing			1
no doubt he possesses a certain talent , but it is not one which causes the football public to drool			2
we are not discussing the equivalent of @entity136 ( who happens to be another @entity116 client )			2
no , @entity116 is merely an agent , and he and his chums do a job which could be done equally well — and for a fraction of the fee — by an accountant and a lawyer			2
any other business might find that incredibly strange , even alarming			2
but football simply shrugs and chuckles and waits for the next burst of bank notes , which it will use to stuff the pockets of players , managers and agents			1
some would suggest it might more equitably be employed in reducing the cost of season tickets , programmes , even half - time tea and pies			2
it simply never crosses the minds of those who take such decisions			2
for football speaks the language of priorities , and its priority is to lavish its largesse upon those who are the least worthy of reward			2
thus the ranks of pestilential chancers take home £ 115,261,136 , and nobody charged with running the game seems to think it scandalous			1
on reflection , i was quite unfair to @entity0			2
when set alongside the brazen profiteering of football agents , it was a model of frugal restraint			1
taxi for @entity186 ... he still fails to cut the mustard listeners to @entity190 radio sport in the 90s will recall the moment at six minutes past six on saturday evenings , when a tune would blare and a plumply over-elocuted voice would begin to bluster			2
@entity186 was putting football to rights			2
his opinions were forceful , provocative and totally untainted by knowledge ; this team was n’t ‘ doing the business ’ , that player was n’t ‘ cutting the mustard ’ , these managers were ‘ tactically naive ’			2
@entity186 said he is ' really , really sorry ' for his verbal abuse of a @entity207 cab driver last week we were reprieved for a few weeks in 1997 when he went to defend his parliamentary seat			2
the electors of @entity211 emphatically rejected him			2
and so , at 6.06 on saturday evening , we were greeted with : ‘ hello again ! just when you thought it was safe to go back to the airwaves , i ’m back ! ’ many people seemed to dismiss him as a harmless impostor who was using football to seek street credibility			2
but others perceived an edge of real nastiness in his sweeping , scornful judgments and glasses were raised when he left the programme			0
yet we wondered if memory was playing tricks			0
was he really as awful as we believed ? the answer arrived last week , in that tape of our hero ’s altercation with a @entity207 taxi driver			0
‘ you ’ve been driving a cab for 10 years , i ’ve been in the @entity234 , i ’m an award - winning broadcaster , i ’m a @entity236			0
‘ you think your experiences are anything compared to mine ? i do n’t want a lot of backchat , i do n’t want to know how much you know about @entity207 because you do n’t know as much about @entity207 as i do			0
because you think you ’re a big s * * * , having driven a cab for 10 years , you do n’t need to worry about someone who has been in the @entity234 , who ’s an award - winning broadcaster , who ’s a @entity236			0
if you think you ’re going to be sarky with me , get a better education			0
do you get any of this , my little friend ? ’ that was our @entity251 , still ‘ doing the business ’ , still ‘ cutting the mustard ’			0
one of a kind , they say			0
let us hope they ’re right			0
question time just pointless with @entity258 with the heedless courage of men unafraid of appearing ridiculous , the @entity259 have complained to the @entity190			0
their target is the @entity264 ’s immensely capable and experienced reporter @entity263			0
before the match with @entity266 last weekend , she asked @entity259 coach @entity267 if the ritual of the @entity269 gave the @entity266 an unfair advantage			0
@entity259 have complained to the @entity190 about questioning of @entity259 coach @entity267 later , she wondered if @entity267 felt under any pressure , after 22 consecutive defeats against the @entity275 nations			0
and that is all it takes to upset the @entity259 : two perfectly reasonable questions which invite intelligent responses			0
you see , our major sports do n’t expect that sort of thing from tv people			0
of course , newspaper reporters are different ; truculent oiks with dark agendas who take pleasure in embarrassing the great and the good			0
but tv usually knows how to behave			0
after paying huge sums to acquire ‘ the product ’ , they are normally at pains to protect their investment			0
so players , coaches , even seat - warming directors , must be approached on bended knee			0
@entity302 wrote the textbook on this one			0
having stumped up the earth for the @entity12 , they have apparently decided post-match interviews must be conducted this way			0
thus , after @entity56 ’s recent victory at @entity310 , @entity308 was squirmingly asked : ‘ how much did you enjoy that winner , @entity313 ? ’ @entity313 said he had enjoyed it a lot			0
it was faintly demeaning , wholly unrevealing and utterly pointless			0
and it demonstrated precisely why @entity263 does n’t work for @entity258			0
@entity318 the tributes arrived in a deep swell of sympathy for the farmer ’s son , taken in the full bloom of youth			0
the death of a fine cricketer evoked the grief of friends and the distress of strangers			0
yet even as we curse the cruel mischance which cut him down , we celebrate a rare and memorable talent			0
@entity336 departed far too early , but he had left his mark upon his country and upon his sport			0
we mourn his passing .			0
