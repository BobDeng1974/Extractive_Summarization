when @entity1 noticed her baby daughter had an irritation in one of her eyes , she assumed it was due to a pre-existing squint			2
but when @entity10 was three , surgeons correcting her eye condition noticed scarring on her right retina			1
after several trips to @entity14 , @entity10 was diagnosed with the rare condition known as @entity16 - which she had caught after ingesting the eggs of the @entity19 parasite , @entity20			1
there are around 50 cases reported each year in the @entity23 , usually in young children			2
@entity10 , 13 , has been on antibiotics since a parasite infection affected her vision			1
undaunted , she now hopes to be part of the @entity30 team in the future @entity20 is found in the faeces of dogs and cats , and can contaminate the soil in gardens , parks and even playgrounds			1
if accidentally ingested , the roundworm eggs hatch into larvae that penetrate through the walls of the digestive tract and in rare cases can migrate to the eyes and cause serious sight problems			1
@entity10 , who lives near @entity46 and had grown up on a farm , had spent her young life surrounded by animals and picked up the parasite when she was one			1
however , in her case the infection had remained dormant for several years and she had displayed no symptoms			1
then when @entity10 was six the condition reactivated - unusually this time in her left eye			1
she experienced bouts of feeling poorly but it was n't until her teacher noticed a decline in her sight at school that doctors realised what must have happened			1
her mother said : ' we looked after all manner of animals when @entity10 was young , from sheep to household cats and dogs			2
' @entity10 first contracted the condition at around the age of one , which remained undercover for years until it finally attacked when she was six			1
during a three week period , @entity10 had lost a lot of her sight			1
' we were first referred to an optometrist and then swiftly to @entity76 , as @entity10 ’s vision became worse			2
' @entity10 ended up having to make weekly visits to @entity79 , where the infected eye was treated with steroids			1
she has been on antibiotics ever since			0
' @entity10 has scarring in her central vision and is classified as @entity84 in disability terms - a stage between being blind and visually impaired			0
@entity16 is a rare infection caused by roundworm parasites ( @entity20 )			1
it is spread from animals to humans via their infected faeces			1
ocular larva migrans is the least common but potentially most serious type of toxocariasis			0
the condition can develop if the roundworm parasites move into the eyes			0
the main symptoms of ocular larva migrans are blurred or cloudy vision and irritation of the eyes			0
left untreated , ocular larva migrans can result in permanent vision loss , although only one eye is usually affected			1
it affects around 50 people a year and usually affects young children			0
treatment involves taking medication to kill the parasites			0
most people will quickly make a full recovery and wo n't experience any long - term complications			0
source : @entity114 but @entity10 would n't let the condition hold her back			0
her mother said : ' she was as cool as cucumber and has coped so well			0
i 'm very proud of her			0
' @entity10 had gone on a skiing holiday in @entity120 just before her sight deteriorated and was determined to continue with the sport			2
' she really took to it and loved it , ' @entity1 said			0
' it is difficult as she ca n't see much of what she 's skiing on and other people			0
' but she never thinks of it as difficult , as she does n't know any different			0
she also has headphones so she can talk to me while she 's skiing			0
' now 13 , @entity10 has just returned from @entity132 , where she has been training with the @entity30 team			2
she hopes to compete in the 2018 games , which will be held in @entity135			2
the best way to help prevent the rare condition is for dog owners to not only clear up after their pets but to regularly worm them as well			0
@entity143 from the @entity144 , explains : ' the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) lives in animal faeces but can survive even once owners have cleaned up after their pets			1
' in fact , @entity20 is such a resilient parasite it takes bleach and plenty of elbow grease to eradicate it completely			1
' the only way to be sure your pet is not spreading this parasite is to worm regularly – this can be undertaken on a monthly basis to break the life cycle of the parasite			2
' however , research from the ‘ it ’s a @entity165 ’ report from @entity164 revealed that 75 per cent of owners do not regularly worm their pet , while half do n't clear up after their dogs			0

@entity173 ingested the parasite spread by animal faeces
called @entity20 , it can contaminate the soil in gardens , parks and even playgrounds
it lay dormant for several years before almost blinding her in her left eye in just three weeks
but she has refused to let her partial sight stand in her way and hopes to ski for the @entity191 team
