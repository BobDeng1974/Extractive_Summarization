sir @entity3 said only ‘ one or two ’ of his colleagues were opposed to his traditional views			2
he spoke out after being given a formal warning by lord chief justice @entity16 and justice secretary @entity17 for judicial misconduct			1
an inquiry by the @entity20 , the body that polices the behaviour of judges , had found his speeches and newspaper articles were ‘ incompatible with his judicial responsibilities ’			1
last december the office advised sir @entity3 to take a lower profile after he had protested about the devastating impact of family break - up on children , criticised cohabitation , and called for greater support for marriage			1
sir @entity3 , who handles family cases as mr @entity38 , could have served for another five years and was effectively forced out			1
he said : ‘ i would like to refute the erroneous suggestion that my fellow judges are opposed to what i have been doing			0
with one or two exceptions they have been very , if quietly , supportive			0
’ sir @entity3 said he was a whistleblower who needed to speak out against the collapse of family life			1
he confirmed his decision to step down as a judge in april – a resignation announced earlier this year – was linked to his public attempt to speak up for marriage			0
sir @entity3 set up the @entity52 think tank to champion the institution on a national basis and promote ‘ healthy , stable relationships ’			2
he said he strongly disagreed with the inquiry ’s conclusion that his ‘ occasional comments on the huge social problem of family breakdown or my public support for the @entity52 amounts to misconduct or brings the judiciary into disrepute ’			0
campaigning : sir @entity3 has protested about the devastating impact of family break - up on children , criticised cohabitation , and called for greater support for marriage ( file picture ) the judge added : ‘ indeed i think the contrary is true			1
‘ one or two members of the public may resent my intervention for their own particular reasons , hence their complaints , but , judging by the support i have received , that is not the view of the majority			0
’ he said his work with the think tank might be ‘ unusual and unconventional for a judge ’ but it had not interfered with his work in the courtroom			0
‘ tackling these urgent problems calls for those of us who know more about them than anyone else occasionally to blow the whistle publicly and do something , ’ sir @entity3 said			2
' i would like to refute the erroneous suggestion that my fellow judges are opposed to what i have been doing			0
with one or two exceptions they have been very , if quietly , supportive ' sir @entity3 he said he would quit the @entity103 at @entity104 , adding : ‘ i could have carried on for a further five years – and been prepared to complete them – but it is not really feasible if i have to look over my shoulder every time i want publicly to support the @entity52 or its work			1
my position would become increasingly untenable			0
’ last week sir @entity3 wrote an article in the @entity112 in which he said people who wanted to be parents should get married and added that supporting marriage was ‘ something our courts no longer seem able or willing to do ’			2
he said : ‘ the fact is that the single most vital factor , by far , in the successful development of children is a committed , healthy relationship between their parents			0
