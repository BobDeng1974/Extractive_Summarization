more embarrassing details about @entity1 are coming to light a week after a group with ties to @entity4 hacked the production company 's internal servers and released hundreds of documents ranging from never - released movies to employee evaluations			1
hidden among the documents never meant to be seen by the public include the budget for upcoming film @entity13 , starring @entity14 and @entity15 as a tv producer and talk show host recruited by the @entity18 to assassinate @entity4 president @entity19			1
the leaked records show @entity14 , who also directed and wrote the script , was paid $ 8.4million for the film , compared to co-star @entity15 who made $ 6.5million			1
the budget also revealed a pretty important plot point : that @entity27 ' ex-husband @entity26 makes a cameo , for which he was paid $ 5,000			0
officials in @entity4 previously threatened action compared to a-list actors like @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , who can take home more than $ 20million per film , the salaries revealed in the hack show the @entity14 and @entity15 took home relatively average to low pay			1
overall the film cost $ 44million for @entity1 to make			1
meanwhile , @entity51 , the ceo of @entity52 and @entity53 , the co-chairman of the company were both revealed to be making a $ 3million annual salary			0
among the more entertaining details revealed in the budget were how much the production company paid for small items like props			2
millionaires : @entity52 co-chairman @entity53 ( left ) and @entity52 ceo @entity51 ( right ) both make $ 3million a year , according to the leaked documents one part of the script calls for a ' table of weed , coke , pills and panties ' which was budgeted at $ 250			2
thanks to some thrifty production assistants , the cost was brought down to $ 241			0
the hackers also uploaded five yet - to - be - released films to file - sharing websites , including the @entity79 film @entity80 , still in theaters , and @entity82 , the much - anticipated remake set for a december 19 release			1
the company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease - and - desist orders			2
pay information for more than 31,000 employees at @entity91 , a financial firm hired by @entity1 , were taken in the hack as well			1
the pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high - paying salaries			2
the list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site fusion			0
@entity102 , reporting for @entity103 , who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source , said : ' when i sorted the list by ' annual rate , ' i noticed something notable : a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most			0
' based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of @entity52 with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men			0
' @entity117 reviewed almost @entity118 of leaked internal data and reported it included ' employee criminal background checks , salary negotiations , and doctors ' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence			0
' it reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by breaking @entity133 creator @entity132 as well as ' email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing , while one disciplinary letter details a manager 's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate			0
' the leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive			0
one aspect of the leak , which probably has the @entity1 it team reeling , is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords ... under the name ' password '			2
and then there 's the hilarious slideshow written by @entity1 cfo @entity157 , negatively reviewing the company 's own films			1
in one slide , he draws attention to the movies the company put out in 2005 , the worst year in the company 's history			2
those films include @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			0
@entity157 follows that up with a slide about the movies distributed in 2010 like @entity174 , commenting : ' not as bad as 2005 , but still not something to write home about '			0
those on @entity1 's marketing teams devised equally entertaining slides , revealed in the breach			1
a few of the slides take different movies , and explain the concept , and strengths and weaknesses to highlight			0
for movies with a patriotic element , like @entity189 and @entity190 , executives warn to ' avoid @entity192 - centrism ' and focus instead on special effects and star actors			0
presentation : in this leaked slideshow , @entity1 cfo @entity157 calls out the movies that made for the company 's worst financial year on record critic : he follows the 2005 slide up with the movies distributed in 2010 , commenting : ' not as bad as 2005 , but still not something to write home about ' company secrets : another leaked slideshow shows how the company tries to downplay @entity192 themes in films with a patriotic theme the hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the @entity4 regime , unhappy with the country 's portrayal in the film			1
in june , a @entity4 official appeared on the state - run news station to say the country would pursue ' a strong and merciless countermeasure ' if @entity1 released the film			1
despite the threat , @entity1 has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it 's december 25 release date			1
exactly one month before it was set to be released , @entity1 confirmed that the company had been hacked , and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online			1
the day before , an alleged warning posted to @entity232 read : ' this is just the beginning '			0
@entity1 has yet to officially name @entity4 as the source of the cyber attack , but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on wednesday to say they believe a group known as @entity239 is to blame			1
cars enter @entity52 headquarters in @entity242 , @entity243			0
the company is still conducting an internal investigation on the hack the group associated with @entity4 was thought to be behind the large - scale march 2013 attack on @entity250 banks and broadcasters			1
other evidence from the hack points to the regime , including @entity4 - language coding , in similarities to other attacks by @entity239			1
the results of the internal investigation into the attack , currently being carried out by @entity263 's @entity262 forensics unit , are expected to be announced later this week			2
earlier this week , a @entity4 spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say ' wait and see ' when asked if @entity268 was involved			2
staff at @entity1 are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never - ending slew of @entity272 movies the company is producing staff at @entity1 are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never - ending slew of @entity272 movies the company is producing , according to information released following last week ’s cyber attack			1
an un-encrypted text file titled ‘ @entity277 ’ has been released which features a long list of negative employee feedback – and @entity272 ’s name is a reoccurring theme			0
the comedian ’s company , @entity284 , has been responsible for 25 films released by @entity1 over the past 15 years including @entity283 , @entity282 , @entity287 and @entity288			1
these movies turn a profit but are shown little love from the critics and from @entity1 staff it would appear			2
here are some of the comments featured in the leaked document : other criticism from staff was equally as cutting even if the target was n't quite so specific : @entity272 movies such as @entity300 regularly turn a profit for @entity1 but rarely win over the critics or staff a leaked memo has revealed ' the hostile forces are relating everything to the @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
i kindly advise you to just wait and see , ' a spokesman for @entity4 's @entity311 mission			1
@entity4 routinely refers to the @entity192 and @entity250 as hostile forces			0
the @entity313 is also investigating the incident			0
@entity4 complained to the @entity311 in june about the interview , accusing the @entity192 of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of war by allowing production of the movie			1
the @entity268 government denounced the film as ' undisguised sponsoring of terrorism , as well as an act of war ' in a letter to @entity311 @entity326 ban ki - moon			0
' i personally do n't care if ( the movie 's ) disrespectful to @entity19 because he 's evil			1
but that 's not the intent , ' tweeted @entity14 on sunday			2
' @entity4 has produced tons of propaganda films that portray @entity192 's destruction			2
' but cybersecurity expert @entity333 has told the @entity334 that he finds it hard to believe that @entity4 is the perpetrator and instead thinks it is more probable that it was the actions of an employee or ex-employee with administrative access privileges			0
for the studio - which has laid off hundreds of employees over the past year in an effort to contain costs - the possibility of a disgruntled employee wreaking havoc is very real			0
' if terabytes of data left the @entity1 networks , their network detection systems would have noticed easily , ' said @entity333			0
' it would also take months for a hacker to figure out the topography of the @entity1 networks to know where critical assets are stored and to have access to the decryption keys needed to open up the screeners that have been leaked			2
' scary : @entity1 workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying ' hacked by # @entity362 ' - understood to be the initials of a group called @entity365 which has been linked to @entity4 in addition , he said , ' it is possible that @entity4 - sponsored hackers were working with someone on the inside			1
but it is more likely a ruse to shift blame , knowing the distaste the @entity4 regime has for @entity52			0
' @entity52 ' computer system went down last monday after the cyber attack			0
before screens went dark , they displayed a red skull and the phrase ' hacked by # @entity362 , ' which reportedly stands for @entity365			0
the hackers also warned they would release ' secrets ' stolen from @entity1			2
the data released so far from the apparently leaked documents has already been damaging - it revealed all the top executives at @entity52 are white and male , raising questions about control of @entity392 's film output .			1

@entity1 was the target of a large - scale *communications* breach last week , and it 's believed a group tied to @entity4 is responsible
@entity4 officials have previously threatened action if the company releases upcoming film the interview
the movie stars @entity14 and @entity15 as undercover @entity18 operatives on a mission to assassinate @entity4 leader @entity19
among the documents leaked in the hack were the film 's budget , including the salaries of the stars and producers
@entity1 has continued to promote the film and are expected to release the interview as *scheduled* on december 25
