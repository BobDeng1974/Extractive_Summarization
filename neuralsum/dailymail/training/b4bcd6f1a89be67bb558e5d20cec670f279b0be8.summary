and if you can persuade a group of complete strangers to take off each other 's clothes instead of their own , then all the better			0

and while the result may be painfully cringe - inducing at first , it ultimately proves rather sweet as they fumble with zips and buttons , tear trousers and giggle awkwardly as they disrobe			0
some of them struggle while others shed blouses or jeans with ease			0
but as the undressing goes on , embarrassment soon ebbs away and , by the end , they are all under the sheets having a kiss and a cuddle			2
