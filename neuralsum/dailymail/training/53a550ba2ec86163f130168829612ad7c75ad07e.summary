many fathers might find themselves with their hands full when looking after their children , but this fish has his mouth crammed full with scores of his offspring			2
among yellow - headed jawfish - which are mouthbrooders - it is the male that takes responsibility for looking after the eggs until they hatch			1
these incredible images were captured on the sea floor in the ocean off the @entity18 , in the @entity19			1
what a mouthful : the male yellow headed jawfish was captured with its mouth stuffed full of eggs on the seafloor at @entity26 on the @entity18 , in the @entity19 dr @entity27 was 18 metres beneath the surface off @entity26 when he spotted the reclusive jawfish with its mouth stuffed with eggs			1
yellow - headed jawfish , which are found on coral reefs in the @entity19 , are typically only seen with their heads and upper bodies protruding from their burrows - although occasionally they can be spied hovering a short distance from their territory			1
after noticing the mouthbrooding fish , dr @entity27 , who specialises in underwater and hyperbaric medicine , waited 20 minutes to get a shot of it opening wide to aerate its brood			1
rotating the egg mass in this way keeps them clean and hydrated			0
' the eggs being spit out is a very rare shot , ' dr @entity27 said			0
@entity54 : among yellow headed jawfish , it is the male who looks after the eggs until they hatch lucky spot : photographer dr @entity27 was 18 metres below the surface when he spied the jawfish ' i had to spend more than 20 minutes with the fish waiting to get those pictures			1
' the jawfish at this dive site in @entity26 live in what is known as a rubble field next to a reef , and this group was about 52 feet deep , ' he said			2
' i swam along the rubble field looking closely at the jawfish			2
' when you see them they are at most a foot above the bottom and as you approach them they retreat into their burrows			0
' the key is to locate a male with eggs in his mouth , then slowly sink to the bottom near the burrow			2
' you have to wait till he starts poking his head out , slowly getting within a foot of the burrow			0
' as he grows comfortable with your presence , he will rise out of his burrow to aerate the eggs			0
' if you are in the right position , you can capture him with the eggs out of his mouth , ' dr @entity27 added			0
@entity99 life : found in coral reefs in the @entity19 sea , yellow - headed jawfish are rarely seen outside of their burrows reclusive : the jawfish ( left ) is typically only seen with its head and upper section protruding from its burrow , meaning this photograph of it aerating the eggs in its mouth ( right ) is a ' very rare shot ' among mouthbrooders , after courtship , the male fertilises the eggs and then collects them in his mouth , protecting them until they hatch at which point the fry swims off to fend for themselves			1
during this period the male can not feed , meaning mouthbrooding fish are underweight by the time the eggs hatch			0
once the eggs have hatched , the fish will spend a period of time feeding and recuperating			0
rare : the incredible images show paternal mouthbrooding - which is relatively rare - in action crammed : this image captures the mouthbrooding yellow - headed jawfish in its burrow on the sea floor in the @entity19 taxing : the fish can not feed while it is mouthbrooding , and will be underweight by the time the eggs eventually hatch			1
