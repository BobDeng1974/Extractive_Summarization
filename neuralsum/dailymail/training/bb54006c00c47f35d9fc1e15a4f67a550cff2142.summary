@entity0 survived having two men sent to the sin bin to record an unconvincing win over @entity4 in an ill - tempered affair which failed to live up to the earlier offering at @entity7			1
following the nail - biter between @entity10 and @entity11 , this match was always going to struggle to hit the same heights and it was no surprise it turned into a niggly contest between two sides likely to finish the season at opposing ends of the table			1
@entity0 , beaten semi-finalists last season , lost @entity20 and @entity21 to the sin bin in the second half to allow @entity26 fly - half @entity24 to keep the pressure on with five penalties			1
hand - off : @entity0 winger @entity29 fights off the attention of @entity4 's @entity31 try : @entity31 's attempted tackle was n't enough as @entity33 left scored for @entity0 game of two halves : harlequins were excellent in the first half and terrible in the second but despite the second - half absence of their props for 10 minutes apiece - both dismissed for high tackles on hooker @entity45 - @entity44 ’s men always had their noses in front after winger @entity48 scored the only try of the game after 10 minutes			1
‘ it was frustrating , ’ said @entity52 8 @entity51			0
‘ we allowed them to be niggly at the breakdown and did n’t deal with it ourselves			0
we need to be much better than that			0
’ fly - half @entity59 endured a poor day with the boot but still kicked 15 points while @entity29 scored @entity52 ’ other try in an otherwise disappointing game			1
@entity4 also had @entity65 sent to the sin bin in the first half			2
@entity52 had dominated the first half with tries from @entity48 and replacement @entity29 and two conversions and two penalties from @entity59 , who could have made the win more comfortable were it not for three simple misses			1
first half : @entity4 endured a disappointing first half , and fund themselves losing 20 - 6 at the break opener : harlequins were quick out of the blocks in their @entity82 opener at @entity7 some excellent goal - kicking from @entity24 saw him succeed with five penalties but crucially @entity4 failed to score a try when @entity52 were down to 13 men			1
a late penalty from @entity59 saw the visitors home			0
@entity91 wing @entity89 was the only new name in the @entity52 line - up as he faced his old club			0
@entity20 led the side , having taken over the club captaincy from @entity97			0
in contrast , @entity4 had some fresh faces with former @entity0 @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity103 @entity102 all featuring in the pack			2
in the third minute , @entity52 had the first chance for points but @entity59 surprisingly missed a straightforward penalty attempt before @entity4 suffered two blows in quick succession			2
first , @entity112 full back @entity110 limped off to be replaced by @entity113 before @entity59 give his side the lead by kicking a more difficult penalty			0
dangerous : @entity0 ' new captain @entity20 was sent to the sin bin after a dangerous tackle points : @entity24 scored five penalties for the @entity26 but it was n't enough to complete the comeback @entity4 were starved of possession in the opening 10 minutes and inevitably @entity52 made them pay			1
@entity125 won a line - out before a clever flick - on by @entity128 sent @entity48 flying into the corner for a try which @entity59 converted with a splendid kick			0
it was proving to be a mixed bag on the kicking front for @entity59 as moments later he failed with a routine penalty so , despite totally dominating the opening quarter , @entity52 only led 10 - 0 at the end of it			0
the concession of a number of penalties by the @entity52 allowed @entity112 their first foothold in the game and they were rewarded with their first points when @entity147 fired over a long - range penalty			1
this proved to be only a temporary respite for the @entity4 as once again they suffered two setbacks in quick succession			0
centre @entity65 was sin - binned for a deliberate offside and from the resulting penalty , @entity59 made no mistake			0
yellow : @entity157 ( right ) was shown the yellow card shortly after @entity20 to reduce @entity52 to nine men @entity7 : @entity128 is tackled by @entity4 's @entity160 during their @entity82 game @entity52 also lost a player through injury when @entity48 departed to be replaced by @entity33 before @entity125 gave away a foolish penalty , which @entity147 kicked to briefly keep @entity4 in contention before @entity52 struck again			1
they moved the ball wide allowing @entity51 to feed @entity33			0
the wing had little space in which to move but he easily evaded a dreadful attempt at a tackle from @entity31 to score @entity52 ' second try , which @entity59 converted for a healthy 20 - 6 interval lead			1
early in the second half , @entity175 collected a yellow card for a tip tackle on @entity45 , enabling @entity147 to kick his third penalty and , minutes later , @entity52 were down to 13 men when @entity21 was sin - binned for a high tackle on @entity45			2
@entity175 returned in time to see @entity147 kick another penalty but @entity4 could not capitalise as @entity52 were restored to 15 men with no further damage done			2
@entity147 was again on target to reduce the arrears to five points but @entity4 could make no further inroads and @entity52 held on .			2
