the @entity1 military has begun testing troops to see if using low level shocks of electricity keeps them alert when they are in combat			0
the @entity6 reportedly feels coffee and energy drinks are not enough to keep soldiers ' minds from drifting			1
early experiments are underway using ' noninvasive ' brain stimulation on dozens of volunteers - who seemed to perform better as a result			1
the @entity1 military has begun testing troops to see if using low level shocks of electricity keep them alert during combat			0
early experiments are underway using ' noninvasive ' treatments , such as transcranial magnetic stimulation , stock image pictured , on volunteers who reported increased performance as a result the research carried out by the @entity1 military focused on two transcranial techniques			1
@entity27 magnetic stimulation ( @entity28 ) involves passing an electric current to the brain via a magnetic field			1
@entity33 direct current stimulation is where the current is passed directly into the brain using sensors attached to the head			1
in each case , a very small dose - approximately one milliampere - was used on each participant for 10 minutes at a time			2
the tests were designed to check for alertness and general performance ; one involved participants following instructions on a screen to spot an aircraft as it came into friendly airspace			0
the @entity48 reported that @entity49 , one of the researchers , said the response was better than caffeine and without the side effects like jitters or palpitations			0
this appeared to be the case when subjects were kept awake for 30 hours , or longer than a full day			0
there was also no ‘ crash ’ after a few hours , unlike when the effects of caffeine wear off			1
the study has been carried out at the @entity64 at @entity65 in @entity66			0
the team behind it hope that in the near future soldiers will carry a pair of electrodes with them that they can easily apply to themselves to carry the electric current			2
they were commissioned due to the changing nature of warfare ; troops on the front line have adrenalin to keep them going but those sifting through reams of intelligence data need something to keep them sharp too			0
researchers claim the response to brain stimulation was better than that experienced through caffeine in coffee , pictured , and energy drinks - yet without the side effects like jitters or palpitations			1
there was also no ' crash ' after a few hours when the effects of the caffeine wore off the @entity1 military has a long and chequered history when it comes to altering the minds of soldiers in a bid to make them more effective killing machines in the 1960s men were given lsd at @entity107 in @entity108 to see if could be used as a weapon of war			1
other test subjects were exposed to mustard gas , nerve agent @entity113 and other potentially fatal chemicals			0
in 1994 the @entity116 in @entity66 , another @entity1 @entity64 facility , drew up a paper proposing the idea of a ‘ gay bomb ’ which would flood an area with hormones and turn enemy soldiers into homosexuals with an increased libido			1
the research focused on two techniques , transcranial magnetic stimulation , in which a magnetic field passes an electric current to the brain , and transcranial direct current stimulation , where it is passed directly into the brain			1
a very small dose - around one milliampere - was used on each participant for 10 minutes at a time			2
the tests were designed to check for alertness and general performance ; one involved participants following instructions on a screen to spot an aircraft as it came into friendly airspace			0
staff sergeant @entity145 , who took part , said he felt a ‘ tingling ’ when he was first hooked up to the electrodes but was ‘ refreshed ’ afterwards			2
the @entity48 reported that overall , those who did not get any brain stimulation , including coffee , ' performed significantly worse than any of the stimulation groups			1
' as to the difference between caffeine and the electricity , the latter seemed to be more effective			0
@entity158 @entity157 , a biomedical engineer who oversees the research , said : ' we found that people who receive the stimulation are performing consistently			2
' dr @entity163 , an assistant professor of psychology at @entity165 , added : ‘ there is some evidence that it does seem to work			0
there have been a few studies that if you use it in the right place it can help mathematical calculations when people are sleep - deprived			0
