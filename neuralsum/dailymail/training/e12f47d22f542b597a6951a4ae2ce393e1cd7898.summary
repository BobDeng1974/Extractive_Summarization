conspiracy forums have been set ablaze this week after a lady claiming to be a former @entity3 employee said she had seen humans on @entity5			1
the woman , named ' @entity7 ' , called into @entity9 radio station , @entity10 , with a ' confession ' that she had witnessed suited men running on the red planet in 1979			1
@entity7 said she was working as part of a ' downstairs ' team downloading telemetry from a @entity17 when she saw the humans via live feed			1
scroll down for audio the woman , named ' @entity7 ' , called in to @entity9 radio station , @entity10 , with a ' confession ' that she had witnessed suited men running on the red planet in 1979 @entity7 said she was working as part of a ' downstairs ' team downloading telemetry from a @entity17 ( pictured ) when she saw the humans ' i wonder if you could solve a 27 - year - old mystery for me , ' she asked the presenter			1
' that old @entity17 rover was running around			2
' then i saw two men in space suits - not the bulky suits we normally used , but they looked protective			0
they came over the horizon walking to the @entity38			0
' @entity3 has not corroborated the story , but this has n't stopped conspiracy theorists from claiming it as evidence for a ' secret space programme			1
' according to @entity7 , six other @entity3 workers saw the two humans walking on the red planet 's surface			1
' we ran upstairs – but they locked the door , and taped paper over the door so we could n't see , ' she said			0
' my question is – were they our guys ? ' the @entity17 @entity5 mission was performed by two spacecraft , @entity17 and @entity60 , launched within a couple of weeks of each other in the 1970s			1
each spacecraft consisted of an orbiter and a lander , which travelled attached together for nearly a year to reach @entity5 orbit			2
the orbiters then began taking pictures of the @entity5 surface , from which a landing site was selected			1
the landers then separated from the orbiters and soft landed			0
earlier this week , physicist dr @entity73 said he believes an ancient civilisation on @entity5 was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race			2
dr @entity73 says ancient @entity78 known as @entity79 and @entity80 were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today			0
back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on @entity5 could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion			2
' the martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on @entity5 , ' he told @entity95 at the time			2
' a nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet			0
' but since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race			0
according to @entity105 , the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests ' may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space			0
' earlier this week , physicist dr @entity73 said he believes an ancient civilisation on @entity5 was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race			2
he says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on @entity5 ( image from his paper shown ) the orbiters continued imaging and , between @entity17 and @entity60 , imaged the entire planet at what was then high resolution			1
' although no traces of life were found , @entity17 found all elements essential to life on @entity131 - carbon , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen and phosphorus - were present on @entity5 , ' said @entity3			1
‘ there are a few problems with @entity7 's testimony , ’ @entity137 , @entity136 expert , and author of the book @entity141 , @entity136 told @entity142			2
‘ firstly , the @entity17 landing craft did not send a live tv feed back to @entity131 , and as its name suggests it simply landed on the @entity5 surface , it did not have wheels like the latest curiosity craft			1
her grasp of technological terms seems hazy and of course by remaining anonymous it is virtually ' impossible to know if she really worked for @entity3			0
’ the story does however strike a note with conspiracy theorists who believe that @entity3 and other human agencies have secretly visited @entity5 and established colonies there			1
' i wonder if you could solve a 27 - year - old mystery for me , ' she asked the presenter			0
' that old @entity17 rover was running around			0

pictured is a view of @entity5 ‘ other conspiracy theorists who believe the moon landings were faked , note that @entity7 might have inadvertently seen the fakery behind the @entity17 missions , ’ said mr @entity137			1
‘ officially , the two @entity17 landing craft touched down on @entity5 in 1976 , but according to this viewpoint they were set up at a remote desert location and @entity7 accidently saw a feed revealing this fakery			1
‘ the missions are faked to hide the real activity going on in outer space , which could include collaborating with aliens who already live on @entity5			2
’ @entity7 's claim follows a similarly bizarre theory by physicist dr @entity73 who believes an ancient civilisation on @entity5 was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race			1
dr @entity73 says ancient @entity78 known as @entity79 and @entity80 were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today			0
he claims his theory could explain the @entity201 - namely why , if the universe is abundant with life , we have n't heard anything from anyone else yet			0
he warns , though , that we need to be fearful of an attack on our own planet , and should mount a manned mission to @entity5 to know what we 're up against .			0

she claims that 's when she saw two humans walking on @entity5 surface
according to @entity7 , six other @entity3 employees witnessed the same thing
conspiracy theorists say this is evidence of a ' secret space programme '
