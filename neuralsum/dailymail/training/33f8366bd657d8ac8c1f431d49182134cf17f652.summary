the teenaged @entity1 cheerleader who created a social media firestorm with photos of the @entity5 big game she hunted has fired back at her online attackers			1
in a typo - laden defense that invokes the safari - loving 26th @entity10 president @entity9 , @entity12 , 19 , claims that killing rare rhinos and elephants actually helps to save them			1
' this is a conservation effort to assure [ sic ] that they never do become extinct , ' the teen from @entity17 , @entity18 posted to @entity21			2
' this is a conservation effort ! ' : 19 - year - old @entity1 cheerleader @entity12 is firing back at the critics who say her hunting safaris to @entity27 are just poaching expeditions disguised as conservations unfairly targeted ? @entity12 , far right , loves @entity30 , cheerleading , and hunting @entity5 big game @entity21 , of course , is where the controversy began			1
by wednesday evening , 150,000 global animal lovers had signed a petition urging ceo @entity37 to take down the photos in which @entity39 smiles proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from extinction			2
' [ @entity9 ] was a hunter too , right ? he killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure			2
' yet , how can it be possible that someone can love the earth , and take from the @entity52 in the name of conservation ? for some folks , they 'll never understand			0
for the rest of us ... we were born that way			0
@entity60 , ' wrote @entity39			0
@entity39 ' @entity21 remains active , the photos that started the controversy have vanished			1
meanwhile , a @entity21 account has now been created as part of @entity39 ' defense called @entity39			2
' support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in @entity27 , ' reads the page			0
conserving by killing ? 19 - year - old @entity18 cheerleader @entity12 really likes to kill rare animals in @entity27			1
while she pays for her legal hunts , her critics says she 's not the conservationist she claims to be @entity76 5 : @entity39 says her first kill was a rare african white rhino , part of her quest to bag the @entity5 game animals ( rhino , elephant , @entity85 , leopard and lion ) legal : the young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she 's doing is fine , since she pays the governments of @entity5 countries to kill the animals @entity39 claims photos of dead hippos , elephants , lions and other beasts on @entity21 are a testament to her hunting skills and dedication to game preservation			1
but critics are appalled by the teen and are calling @entity110 sick and depraved for killing the rare animals and boasting about it online			0
' for the sake of all animals , ' reads the petition against @entity39 as it implores animal lovers to sign , ' especially the animals in the @entity5 region ... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal ! ' @entity39 , whose @entity21 indicates she ' is looking to host a tv show in january 2015 , ' maintains she is doing what 's best for the preserves , where there is n't always space for even threatened species like elephants or lions			1
' controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these , ' @entity39 writes			0
' funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property			0
' hungry : @entity39 defends her killing of elephants by saying their meat goes on to feed hundreds of thankful village families @entity39 's photos show her posing with bagged zebras , hugging a dead leopard , and smiling beside elephants she 's killed			1
one particular photo , in which she 's posing alongside a an extremely endangered rhinoceros , has her critics especially steaming , but the @entity1 cheerleader says it was alive and well			1
' the vet drew blood , took dna samples , took body and head measurements , treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics			0
i felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the @entity174 population through conservation , ' she wrote			0
however , @entity39 has in her quest to bag the @entity5 game animals ( lion , elephant , @entity85 , leopard , and @entity181 / black rhinoceros ) shot a white rhino , which number around 20,000			2
' the first animal i ever shot was a @entity174 with a .416 @entity186 ! ! ' the teen writes on her @entity21 page			0
because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist , some critics say @entity39 should be banned from hunting in @entity27 completely			1
family pride : @entity39 first learned to love the hunt when she started following her father to @entity27 for his own hunts at age 9 ' harvest ' : ' another harvest for today , ' wrote @entity39 with this photo			2
' white springbok , it 's 1 of the 4 color shades of this animal ! and let me tell you it 's one of my favorite kinds of meat so far ! ' a second petition , this one on @entity215 and originating from @entity27 , is hoping to do just that			0
' @entity12 is an @entity10 born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting @entity5 wildlife under the facade of conservation , ' reads the petition			1
it continues : ' she has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless @entity5 animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms			0
' critics say the 19 - year - old is not conservationist and is simply reaping the benefits of her @entity21 photos with @entity5 animals to help get a television deal ' this time i got my leopard , ' writes @entity39 of a third safari she took at age 14			1
' and also took down a hippo to get 6 of the @entity240 '			0
