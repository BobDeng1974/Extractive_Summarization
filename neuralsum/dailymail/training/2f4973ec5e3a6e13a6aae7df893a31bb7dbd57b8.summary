@entity1 legislators on wednesday considered whether to join every other state in the nation in putting anti-bullying policy into law			1
a bill introduced by rep. @entity7 , a @entity9 @entity8 , in the @entity10 would define bullying , prohibit it in public schools and require public school districts to adopt their own policies addressing the issue			1
@entity16 , a seventh - grader from @entity18 , and her father , @entity19 , spoke in favor of the bill , with the 12 - year - old saying she 's frustrated with school officials who turn the other way when she tells them about death threats she 's received along with harassment in person and online			1
' the school needs to know exactly what bullying is because clearly to them i 'm just a student who 's being teased , ' @entity16 told the committee			1
' i just want other people to realize how big of a deal this is			0
' victim : 12 - year - old @entity16 spoke in front of the @entity1 state legislature on wednesday in support of an anti-bullying bill			1
pictured above in a september 2014 tv interview in a previous interview this past september , @entity16 and her mother recounted how the bullying got so bad that she had to be pulled out of @entity47 in @entity18			1
' i was kind of quiet about it because i was like " oh , this is n't a big deal , it 's going to stop " so i did n't really mention it at the time			0
but then it kind of progressed into a more serious thing , ' she told @entity56			0
her mother says they took out an order of protection after her life was threatened			0
on wednesday , there was no testimony against the proposal , but skeptical lawmakers asked whether it was necessary since a recently adopted state regulation provides similar protections			2
the measure would explicitly define bullying as any repeated harassment , hazing or threatening online or in person			2
it carries the force of law , meaning parents and local authorities could go after schools and education officials who do n't comply , @entity7 said			2
hold out : if the bill basses , @entity1 will be the final state to enact anti-bullying legislation if schools violate the state administrative rule approved in 2013 , it would count only against their accreditation rating			1
forty - six of the 49 states that have established bullying laws did so by 2010			2
@entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 were the last to make changes , leaving @entity1 as the only state that has n't addressed the issue with legislation			1
@entity98 , director of @entity100 's @entity99 , said most state laws enforcing bullying definitions and procedures were enacted in the mid- 2000s , with updates like cyberbullying provisions being added every year			2
she said the laws build better environments for kids to learn and mature in			0
' law really drives the policies and practices of schools , ' @entity98 said			0
she added later , ' and the law sets standards so there are some consistencies between schools			0
' with the exception of the 2009 term , anti-bully bills have been brought before the @entity121 , which meets every other year , each session since 2003			0
last session , in 2013 , rep. @entity123 introduced a bill similar to @entity7 's , but killed it before the measure could be considered in committee			2
@entity123 , a @entity128 @entity8 , said her bill could have had repercussions for the success of the anti-bullying rule that @entity133 was in the process of enacting			2
' @entity135 and her staff told me not to make a fuss about it right then , ' @entity123 said			0
@entity141 lawmakers citing local control have been the primary opposition to anti-bullying provisions in @entity1			1
most bills died in committee along party lines			0
' the floor discussion was ' we can take care of our own local communities and our own schools , and we do n't need any more code to tell us what to do , ' ' @entity123 said			1
that argument was repeated wednesday by @entity156 of the @entity157			0
@entity156 had intended to testify against the bill but changed his mind , he said , after hearing proponents speak			0
he acted instead as an informational witness and told the committee that anti-bullying legislation superseding the existing rule was unnecessary and may inhibit schools boards from making their own decisions			1
rep. @entity168 , a @entity141 , questioned whether the @entity1 legislature can force a cultural change on schools			1
@entity7 said she believes the legislature can and should spawn change to deter bullying in @entity1 schools by sending a message with her bill			1
the committee did not take action on the measure , which faces several legislative hurdles before it could become law			0
@entity7 said she 's not sure whether it has enough support to pass .			0

the @entity1 legislature is currently considering an anti-bullying bill
if passed , @entity1 will be the final state to enact anti-bullying legislation
some lawmakers in the state have opposed such legislation on the basis that local communities should have the power to address the issue
on wednesday , bullying victim @entity16 , 12 , spoke about her experience being tormented at school to the legislators
