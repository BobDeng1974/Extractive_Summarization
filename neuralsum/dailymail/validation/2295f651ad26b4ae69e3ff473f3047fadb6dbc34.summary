in a bid to potentially bring the woolly mammoth back from the dead scientists have begun extracting dna from the remains of a beast found in @entity6			1
a team of experts took samples of bone marrow from the extinct creature 's front left leg during a special symposium at a university in @entity6 on monday			1
the samples will be examined at a laboratory in @entity17 and by scientists in @entity19 with the hope of being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals			1
the samples will be examined at a laboratory in @entity17 and by scientists in @entity19 with the hope of being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals at the very least , the @entity35 hope to decipher the mammoth 's complete dna structure by 2017			1
the perfectly - preserved remains were discovered two years ago in the @entity40 permafrost region , having been frozen for about 28,000 years			1
dr @entity41 , the director of the @entity42 in @entity17 , told @entity43 : ' if the samples are good then our coordinated work , i think , will allow in a year or two to decipher the world 's first nuclear genome of the mammoth			2
' today the technology allows it			0
we 're doing all this as part of ' the @entity56 ' project , which is being implemented in two ways			0
the perfectly - preserved remains ( pictured ) were discovered two years ago in the @entity40 permafrost region , having been frozen for about 28,000 years			1
it is thought the carcass belonged to a female woolly mammoth aged between 50 and 60 when she died @entity62 ( shown ) was also found in the permafrost close to the perfectly - preserved trunk			1
experts will use modern methods to analyse samples taken from the creature and the facility , which will specialise in molecular palaeontology , will also study the remains of other dinosaurs found in the region ' firstly by searching for live cells , culturing them and creating a clone , then secondly by creating artificial living cells based on artificial nucleus @entity3			1
' the remains , complete with the creature 's famous hair , were discovered in may 2013 on an @entity82 island off the diamond - rich @entity40 , the largest region in @entity35			1
mammoth blood was also found in the permafrost close to the perfectly - preserved trunk			1
it is thought the carcass belonged to a female aged between 50 and 60 when she perished			0
the team was led by the dr @entity88 , a professor of the @entity89 in @entity90 ( pictured above the carcass )			0
the work forms part of ' the @entity56 ' project , which plans to search for live cells , culture them and create a clone before creating artificial living cells the mammoth ( remains pictured ) was roughly the size as a modern @entity103 elephant , standing up to 11ft ( 3.3 metres ) tall and weighing about seven tonnes			1
its fur and long hair protected it from the harsh winters			0
the remains found in @entity40 are the best - preserved ever found in the 1993 film , scientists use dinosaur dna taken from a mosquito preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park			1
last year a controversial @entity118 billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real life @entity121			0
mining magnate @entity122 , who has already embarked on a project to rebuild the @entity125 , was rumoured to be working with the team who created @entity128 the sheep			0
it was said the park would be based at @entity122 's super resort in @entity133			0
but the research has shown that their dna is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction			0
however , @entity19 scientists are hoping that the samples found on the @entity6 woolly mammoth are n't too old			1
they plan to take the dna samples and reassemble them into a full genome			2
this could then be injected into embryonic cells which have had their own dna taken out , and a suitable living surrogate would be found			2
samples of bone tissue were taken on monday during a gathering at the @entity149 in @entity17 , as part of a special @entity151 on the modern methods of working with fossilised remains			1
the team was led by the dr @entity88 , a professor of the @entity89 in @entity90			0
a new laboratory opening in @entity17 on tuesday will use modern methods to analyse samples taken from the creature			1
the facility , which will specialise in molecular palaeontology , is the only one of its kind in @entity35 and will also study the remains of other dinosaurs found in the region			2
dr @entity41 said : ' we are taking samples of bone marrow - it is one of the best materials for dna analysis			1
' while no one knows exactly , presumably a mammoth nuclear dna is made up of 40 to 45 million nucleotides			0
' if we set this whole sequence , it will be very great progress for the project of the study and cloning of mammoths			0
' this knowledge would enable the synthesis of artificial dna molecules			2
woolly mammoths co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food			0
they are the best studied of all the prehistoric animals because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in @entity6 and @entity192 , as well as dung and skeletons			1
the mammoth was roughly the size as a modern @entity103 elephant , standing up to 11ft tall and weighing about seven tonnes , and its fur and long hair protected it from the harsh winters			0
the woolly mammoth ( stock image ) is related to the elephant			0
the creatures lived on @entity205 in the @entity82 until 4,000 years ago			2
they also co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food in 2013 , a group of scientists discussed the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction , also known as ' de-extinction '			2
for example , the dodo ( pictured ) evolved without any natural predators , but it was forced into extinction by humans who killed them all for food another animal considered for ' de-extinction ' at the recent conference was the @entity224 - a species of plains @entity226 that once lived in @entity227			2
the last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 the remains found in @entity40 , also known as the @entity40 , were the best - preserved ever found and scientists believe there is a good chance of being able to clone the animal			1
the eventual plan is to plant an implanted egg into a live elephant for a 22 - month pregnancy			0
in 2013 , a group of scientists from around the world met for @entity243 conference in @entity244 , sponsored by @entity245			0
the group were discussing the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction , also known as ' de-extinction '			0
the animals included the dodo bird , the @entity252 , last seen in 1904 in @entity253 , and the @entity224 , a plains zebra which once lived in @entity227 but died out in 1883			0
however , a real life @entity121 is not an option , it is said , because dinosaur dna is just too old			0
the remains , complete with the creature 's famous hair , were discovered in may 2013 on an @entity82 island off the diamond - rich @entity40 , the largest region in @entity35 ( pictured ) as if he was sleeping : the remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros , ( pictured ) who has been named @entity266 and still has its wool , has been discovered in the ice of @entity6			1
it is the first juvenile of the species to be found the remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros , which still has its fleece , was discovered in the ice of @entity6 last month			1
named @entity266 , the extinct creature - which must be at least 10,000 years old and is the first juvenile woolly rhino to be found - was well preserved by permafrost and experts are hopeful of extracting its dna			1
a local hunter found the infant woolly rhino in a ravine by a stream in @entity35 's largest and coldest region , the @entity40 , also known as @entity40 , in september			2
initially , he thought the carcass was a reindeer , until he saw the horn growths and realised he had made the historic discovery of the world 's first baby woolly rhino			0
scientists will first try to extract @entity3 from the remains , which was kept frozen to increase the chances of this being possible			2
they hope to get results in a ‘ week or two ’			0
the calf ’s remains weigh 132lbs ( 60kg ) and were found by @entity298 , a hunter and businessman from @entity301 district .			2

perfectly - preserved remains were found in the @entity40 permafrost
the extinct animals was said to have been frozen for about 28,000 years
experts took samples of bone marrow from the creature in @entity6
samples will be examined in @entity17 and by scientists in @entity19
@entity316 hopes to clone the prehistoric animal and create artificial living cells
