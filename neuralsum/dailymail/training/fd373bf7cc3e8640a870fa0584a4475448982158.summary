a judge has warned of the dangers of informal surrogacy agreements after a woman found she had no parental rights to the baby she had asked her friend to conceive with her husband			1
the ‘ do it yourself ’ - style surrogate pregnancy ended in the @entity10 after the boy , now three , was effectively left with two mothers			2
unable to have children of her own , a woman asked a close friend to be artificially inseminated at home with her husband ’s sperm			1
a surrogate pregnancy ended in bitter recrimination and a three - year - old boy effectively having two mothers ( stock picture ) but when the woman ’s marriage broke down months after the birth of the child , she found she had no parental rights because she was not the boy ’s legal or biological mother			1
yesterday , she was granted a residency order to care for the child , but the judge warned against anyone considering an informal surrogacy agreement , rather than through a professional agency			0
describing the case as a ‘ cautionary tale ’ , mrs justice @entity38 underlined the ‘ real dangers ’ of private surrogacy agreements and urged couples to use licensed and regulated fertility clinics			1
even then , surrogacy contracts are not enforceable and a gestational mother can always change her mind about handing the child to the couple			2
the father and surrogate mother were named on the toddler ’s birth certificate and , in the eyes of the law , they are his parents			2
the judge said medics had spotted something was amiss when the surrogate mother booked herself in at the @entity62 to give birth			0
doctors insisted on seeing a formal surrogacy agreement and the couple went to a firm of solicitors , who drafted an agreement			0
mrs justice @entity38 said the solicitors unwittingly committed a crime when they drafted it , because they charged for the preparation of the agreement , which is in breach of the @entity76			0
the couple ’s relationship broke down soon after the birth and they have since divorced			1
the court heard they made a second legal error when they failed to seek court recognition of the woman ’s parenthood within six months of the birth			1
the judge said the time limit was mandatory and making a parental order in the woman ’s favour was ‘ not an option ’			0
legal chaos ensued after the couple 's relationship broke down within months of the little boy 's birth , @entity92 's @entity10 heard allowing her to formally adopt the child was also not an option and the woman was left with no legal rights over the boy			1
the judge said social workers and lawyers had worked hard to find a solution			0
after several years of ‘ bitter recriminations ’ the couple set aside their grievances and put in place practical shared care arrangements , the court heard			0
while the woman could never become the boy ’s legal mother , mrs justice @entity38 said steps could be taken to ‘ provide her with security and recognition of her status ’			1
the surrogate mother , who remains a close family friend , technically has parental responsibility for the boy			2
but the judge directed that he should remain a ward of court indefinitely and made a shared residence order in favour of the former couple , effectively granting the woman parental responsibility for the child			0
the surrogate mother was banned from exercising her parental rights without permission from the court .			0

unable to have children of her own , a woman had done a deal with a close friend who was ' artificially inseminated at home ' with her husband 's sperm
legal chaos ensued after the couple 's relationship broke down within months of the little boy 's birth , the @entity10 heard
now , in a case serving as a warning against *illegal* private surrogacy deals , the woman has been *refused* recognition as the boy 's legal mother
