by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 16 april 2013 @entity2 furniture giant @entity1 has been left red - faced after the name of one of their products was translated into something less than appropriate			1
a customer put the name of £ 35 pillow @entity10 into @entity12 which interpreted it as @entity14			1
the translation of @entity10 , the @entity2 word for rapeseed , was cut in half by the online dictionary , creating the unfortunate combination			1
lost in translation : the name of @entity1 's pillow @entity22 translates into not - so - comfortable @entity24 when put into @entity26 's online dictionary the customer posted the findings on @entity29 , but was soon calmed by @entity2 speaking users of the site			1
although @entity33 was a result of words ‘ lost in translation ’ , this is not the first time @entity1 has found itself in trouble over the meanings of their @entity2 product names in other languages			2
@entity41 , knife @entity42 and pot @entity45 have all caused much amusement to customers across the world , but there are other products that might sell significantly less were they to be translated into @entity52			0
@entity53 , named after a flower , translates into the not - so - romantic sounding ‘ cut blade ’			2
worse is spatula @entity57 , a name which makes perfect sense to a @entity2 set to make the traditional dish after which the product is named , but when translated into @entity52 becomes the rather less appetizing ‘ old man touch ’			0
falling flat - pack : the @entity2 furniture giant 's native product names does not always work when translated into foreign tongues last year the company hired translators before printing their catalogue in @entity72 , after it was discovered that some items had a whole different meaning in parts of @entity76			2
@entity1 bed @entity77 was found to sound ‘ uncomfortably close ’ to the word for third base when pronounced in @entity72 , and plant pot @entity81 , a world which ironically means ‘ really good ’ in @entity2 , sounds like a slang word for sex			1
the flat - pack giant was founded by 87 - year - old @entity87 in 1943 , celebrating its 70th anniversary this year			0
@entity1 is the world ’s largest furniture retailer , recording an annual net profit of £ 3.2billion in 2012 , achieving sales of £ 27.6billion in 44 countries			0
in the @entity94 , where the company first set up shop in 1987 , it was voted the country ’s most popular shop in a survey			0
there are more @entity1 catalogues than bibles printed each year , and it is said that one in ten @entity103 is now conceived on an @entity1 bed .			0

name of @entity1 pillow @entity10 translates to @entity108 on @entity26
raps is the @entity2 word for rapeseed , which was cut short by *service*
other unfortunate @entity1 items *include* @entity116 and pot @entity118
