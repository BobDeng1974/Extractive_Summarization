by @entity0 many security experts have already voiced concerns that fingerprint scanners , such as the one in @entity5 's new @entity4 , are flawed and not as secure as their makers claim			1
now one leading security researcher has taken this a step further suggesting the technology could actually lead to an increase in crime , with the robberies potentially becoming more brutal			1
@entity14 from @entity16 - based firm @entity15 said : ' fingerprints are not fool - proof and can be duplicated and as the usage of this technology increases , we can expect that duplication technology will improve as well			0
' thieves in some regions have worked out that you can force a victim to unlock a secured device , ' and in extreme cases this brutality could lead to fingers being cut off			1
speaking at the launch event in @entity48 , @entity5 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing @entity49 reassured users that @entity33 is secure by explaining that ' all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip ' adding the prints are not stored on an @entity5 server , or backed up to @entity57			1
yet @entity14 claims it should n't be used on its own			0
' unlocking a device with a fingerprint , if done right , can be much more convenient than entering a pin code multiple times a day			0
' ' so many users fail to enable [ @entity63 ] altogether and in this case , fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all , but it provides little added security over a four - digit code			2
' and because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated , they should not be used as the sole credential in a high security scenario unless enhanced through the use of a pin code or other secondary factor of authentication			0
' @entity5 announced that its @entity4 , pictured , has a fingerprint scanner built into the ' home ' button			1
@entity5 has stated that the @entity33 sensor is ' capacitive ' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
users can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			1
@entity33 can also be replace an @entity94 password when buying music , apps or books			2
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - resolution image scan before the @entity101 in @entity103 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip			1
the prints are not stored on an @entity5 server , or backed up to @entity57			0
@entity5 has also stated that the @entity33 sensor is ' capacitive ' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse			1
@entity113 from @entity114 agreed : ' fingerprints are not secret : we leave copies of them wherever we go			0
once someone devious has got hold of a copy , sensors can be fooled			0
' he continues that , unlike passwords , if fingerprint information is stolen it ca n't be changed ' short of getting medieval on your hands with acid , sandpaper or some other hardened - gangster technique			0
' fingerprint authentication has become common in high - end laptops from companies such as @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
@entity139 also added a fingerprint scanner to its @entity142 handset			1
@entity5 unveiled the fingerprint scanner on its @entity4 on tuesday with bold claims about its high levels of encryption and security			1
the firm even suggested that its @entity33 system could revolutionise smartphone security and replace the traditional , everyday password			2
@entity5 's shares fell more than 5 per cent on wednesday , following the launch of its new @entity4 and @entity154			1
the share price ended at a one - month low of $ 467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages downgraded the stock			0
it is thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets , especially the so - called ' cheap ' @entity154 which starts at £ 469 , claiming they were n't low enough for @entity5 to attract new customers , especially in emerging markets such as @entity165			0
analysts predicted that @entity5 would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets , such as @entity165 , and this was bolstered by the fact @entity5 held a mirror event in @entity172 , and announced the @entity4 will also be made available in @entity165 at the same time as other countries for the first time ever			1
rivals including @entity176 and @entity177 do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce , so cost less			0
around a third of the world 's handsets are sold in @entity165 to half a billion people , yet only 12 per cent of these phones are made by @entity5			2
@entity186 rivals @entity176 is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region , pictured right , with @entity165 brands including @entity177 and @entity137 also popular			0
@entity5 is still a popular choice in @entity165 , but predominantly with the @entity165 elite , and @entity192 , vice president of @entity194 's @entity193 told @entity195 : ' rumor has [ @entity5 ] that they make more money in any of the five stores in @entity165 than they do in the @entity200 store in @entity201			2
' @entity5 phones in @entity165 cost around the same amount as the average person 's monthly salary in urban areas , or three months wages for a bus driver , for example			2
the @entity4 is due to sell in @entity165 for 5,288 yuan ( £ 547 ) and the @entity154 for 4,488 yuan ( £ 464 ) and the handsets , which will be available from 20 september , will be launched in @entity165 at the same time as other major territories for the first time ever			0
@entity192 continued that although @entity165 is @entity5 's second largest market , there is a large percentage of the population that it is not able to attract			1
the phrase ' @entity4 ' was the most popular search term on @entity220 , @entity165 's most widely used social network , on wednesday , while ' @entity154 ' did n't appear on the top searches list			2
users questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5s model			0
@entity5 's share of the @entity165 smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the second quarter , according to research firm @entity230 , behind not just @entity176 but also @entity137 , @entity231 , @entity177 and @entity232			1
' even though @entity5 has a lower end @entity234 now , its price is still considered mid-end in @entity165 and not low - end , ' said @entity236 , a @entity237 - based analyst for @entity238			0
around half of @entity165 's smartphone shipments are in the 700 - 1,500 yuan range , said @entity236 , but competing on those prices is n't an attractive prospect for @entity5			2
' considering @entity5 's old rival @entity176 and domestic players such as @entity177 , @entity137 and @entity246 all have phones in that category , @entity5 will still lose out in market share in these key segments , ' she said .			1

@entity5 's @entity4 has a fingerprint scanner built into the ' home ' button
the @entity33 feature lets users unlock their device and buy apps securely
security expert claims the technology could cause a rise in crime and theft
thieves could *physically* force someone to unlock their device or even cut off their fingers
however , @entity5 's scanner has a ' capacitive ' sensor meaning only fingers with a recognisable pulse can be used
