@entity4 , 37 , ballooned to a whopping 31 stone , and had a @entity6 of 59 - almost three times what it should be			1

the father - of - three , who used to weigh 31 stone ( left ) , lost a massive 18 stone after fearing he would not get to see his sons grow up mr @entity4 realised he was on borrowed time after he started skipping medical appointments for fear he was too fat to be examined , which prompted the dramatic change after ditching takeaways and signing up to a diet plan , mr @entity4 soon started to shed the pounds - and just nine months later , weighs a healthy 13st 4lb			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , said : ' i was a ticking time bomb , but still that was n't enough to make me lose weight			1
' what really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a dad			0
' i vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a @entity6 of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy @entity6 around 25 - and mine was much , much higher			1
' that made me realise that i was living on borrowed time			0
' my life had come to the point where i was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations			1

' and i would always avoid going on planes - as i was terrified i 'd have to ask for a seatbelt extension			1
' but now , mr @entity4 's wife @entity54 , 37 , and sons @entity42 , 14 , @entity41 , 11 , and @entity40 , four , could n't be prouder of their newly - slim husband and dad			1

' it has completely transformed my life			2
' the change has been unbelievable and not just physically			0
inside i am a completely different person			0
' i 'd had no major health scare to speak of , although at the size i was i generally tended to avoid the embarrassment of visiting the doctors			2
' but i was in denial for many years , because with a @entity6 of 59 it was n't a case of if i fell ill , it was when			0
' i 'd lost my mum in my mid 20s to bowel cancer and i just did n't want that for my boys			0
i wanted to be around to see them grow up			2
' because of my mum 's early death , when i reached 35 , i was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure the cancer could be caught early if i was unlucky enough to have it as well			0
' i 'd received the letter from the hospital but i was so worried that the hospital would n't be able to do it because of the size of me that i did n't go			0
' even though i knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it was n't detected earlier , the embarrassment and fear kept me away			0
i never want to feel like that again			0
' i 'm the miraculous shrinking man - my weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations			0
