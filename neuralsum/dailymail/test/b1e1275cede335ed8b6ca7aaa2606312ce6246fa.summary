sir @entity0 has spoken out in favour of assisted dying , saying that watching his first wife suffer with dementia has convinced him he wants to ' die with a bit of dignity left '			1
the veteran entertainer , now 87 , said people should not be ' left to suffer ' , adding that in many cases it could be ' more cruel to do nothing ' than allowing them to die			1
sir @entity0 's first wife , @entity13 , was moved into a care home with dementia in 2008 , and he visited regularly to help care for her until her death last year			1
' it ’s a very difficult situation			2
she did n’t remember me			2
it ’s just so awful to have your mind and your memories taken away from you			2
' it bothers me an awful lot that people are just left to suffer			0
if i had @entity46 ’s or dementia i would do something about it			1
' the law should be changed and if people want to die with a bit of dignity left they should be able to do so			1
' if it is what the person wants and it can be proved they are living a life of suffering it can be more cruel to do nothing			2
i ’d like that right for myself			0
' sir @entity0 married ms @entity13 in 1953 , and the couple had three children together before splitting 20 years later			1
he then went on to marry @entity66 , the hostess on the @entity67 , followed by @entity68 , a former @entity69 who he married in 1983			0
while sir @entity0 ( left ) separated from ms @entity13 ( right ) in 1973 , the two remained in contact , and he helped to secretly nurse her after she was taken into a home in 2008 , until she died last year sir @entity0 ( pictured left with third and current wife @entity68 , and right after receiving his knighthood ) said he would like the right to be able to end his life ' with a bit of dignity left ' despite these new relationships , he remained on good terms with ms @entity13 , and supported her through her illness			1
sir @entity0 joins other celebrities and politicians who support assisted dying , including the late author @entity86 , former archbishop of canterbury @entity87 , and @entity90 peer @entity89			1
the latter has already tabled a bill asking that patients with less than six months to live be allowed to take their own life with the help of a doctor			0
however , the proposed change in the law has proved controversial , with distinguished judge @entity99 saying it would ' cross a line ' towards euthanasia			0
prime minister @entity103 and deputy prime minister @entity104 have also spoken out against assisted dying in the past			0
under the @entity106 , those who deliberate assist or encourage others to commit suicide can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison			0
however , in 2010 , the @entity111 , @entity112 , issued guidelines making clear that anyone who assists a loved one who has reached a ' settled and informed ' decision while ' acting out of compassion ' is unlikely to be charged , leading to ambiguity .			0

sir @entity0 said it can be ' more cruel to do nothing ' than to let someone die
@entity124 he would like the right to be able to chose the timing of his own death
he cared for first wife @entity13 after she was moved into care in 2008
