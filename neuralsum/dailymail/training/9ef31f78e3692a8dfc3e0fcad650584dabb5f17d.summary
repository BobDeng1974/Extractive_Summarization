by @entity0 for @entity1 same - sex marriage is one of the highly debated controversial issue which has divided our nation			1
@entity6 - for or against - have failed to reach common - ground on their views while under the current law , same - sex marriage remains illegal			1
but a new @entity12 six - part documentary has captured the raw realities of how two completely different worlds collide			1
living with the enemy firstly documents a @entity18 - based @entity17 minister and an engaged gay @entity20 couple who are required to spend five days in one world , then five days in the other			1
both parties signed up for the @entity12 six - part series , with hope that they will conquer what has previously proved to be difficult - even in today 's day and age			1
@entity38 believes same - sex marriage is an emotionally laden topic of debate , which is why neither parties have n't been able to see eye - to - eye			1
' it 's often a discussion we do n't have due to the stigmatisation of gay people and the stigmatisation of those who hold traditional views , ' he told @entity1			2
' i went into the show not because i wanted to persuade the couple but because i finally wanted to have a gracious conversation about the issue			0
' but while @entity38 acknowledges that there is a stigma surrounding homosexuality , he says they 're not alone			2
' there 's a horrible irony to it , ' he said			0
' i 've been called a homophobe , gay - hater , fundamentalist and worse			0
you should see my email this week , it 's a treat			0
' @entity38 says receiving hate mail and being denounced for this views has become the norm			1
' most days i get told i 'm stupid , ' he said			0
' any @entity71 learns the reality quite quickly that we are branded in certain ways			0
' @entity38 is a minister at @entity32 in south - west @entity18 @entity38 believes marriage is a lifelong union between a man and woman and should not be redefined @entity25 and @entity24 , who got engaged in august last year and married in @entity79 during the documentary , also hoped their opposing views with @entity38 would ' meet somewhere in the middle '			1
' but we did n't move very far because there was a stalemate , ' @entity25 told the @entity1			2
we were n't able to talk to @entity27 about issues objectively as he had a vested interest due to his professional capability			2
' @entity25 , who previously had long term relationship with an @entity17 priest , says he was n't surprised or shocked when he met @entity38			1
' his religious views are very crippling for him and in some way i feel sorry for him , ' he said			0
the couple , who are both passionate atheists , chose to take religion out of their lives as they were sick of being told they were ' sinners ' for being homosexual			0
thus @entity25 can not fathom why he 's being refused a right that 's entitled to any other @entity104			2
' i feel as though i 'm being denied the opportunity to be equal to others based on things that is beyond my control like my sexual orientation or sexual identity , ' he said			0
for @entity25 and @entity24 , their definition of marriage is a simple one			1
' it 's a legal contract between two consenting adults , ' @entity25 said			2
' it 's literally a piece of paper that shows the love and commitment to each other			0
' @entity24 and @entity25 got married in @entity79 during the filming of the documentary earlier this year but @entity38 says marriage is more sacred than just an affirmation of love			1
' it 's an important social structure and has been for hundreds of years , ' he said			0
' it 's a lifelong union between a man and woman , who normally produce children and a place where children are best raised			0
' the @entity20 couple listen to @entity38 's sermon at his @entity18 @entity17 church what @entity38 stressed was that he was n't against ' gay marriage '			1
' @entity141 and @entity25 have the right to live an unhindered life and the right to a contractual relationship but we 're opposed to the redefinition of marriage , ' he said			1
when asked whether he thought that the biblical idea of marriage was outdated , he said : ' the idea is n't archaic because it 's a timeless part of nature and @entity153 stands above time			2
' ' while the world around us is changing , marriage does n't â€“ the biology and physiology of it does n't change , ' he said			0
@entity25 says @entity38 's views are disingenuous			1
' marriage is redefined constantly from women being owned by their husbands to men having multiple wives , ' he said			0
' while the religious approach may not change , marriage can be redefined because it already has been			0
' @entity25 believes with the growing support for marriage equality in @entity6 , it 's only a matter of time that the law will be altered			1
while @entity38 's stance remains the same , he says the overall experience has been enlightening			2
' it made me more acutely aware of the pain gay , lesbian and bi-sexual people feel from our community , ' he said			0
for @entity25 and his husband , they just want to be treated equally			0
' we no longer want to be treated as second class citizens , ' @entity25 said			0
