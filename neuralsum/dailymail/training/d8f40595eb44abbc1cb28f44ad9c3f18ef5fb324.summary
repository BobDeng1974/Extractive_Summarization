by @entity0 ' @entity1 think again ' : chancellor @entity2 is said not to be pleased with the demands @entity4 are demanding an extraordinary £ 4billion of taxpayers ’ money to refurbish the @entity7 , @entity8 has learned			1
the huge sum - enough to build 200 secondary schools - is needed to correct ‘ structural problems ’ , say mps			1
chancellor @entity2 has been warned by @entity14 colleague @entity13 , the @entity15 , that a ‘ capital spending bid ’ running into ‘ several billions of pounds ’ is being prepared by the @entity7 authorities and will land on the chancellor ’s desk this autumn			1
commons sources say the total amount demanded will be £ 4billion , with a further £ 1billion in a ‘ contingency reserve ’			1
it is understood mr @entity2 reacted with fury when he was informed about the imminent demand , telling aides : ‘ they had better think again			1
’ the whopping bill comes at a time when the chancellor is insisting that his austerity measures , including welfare cuts and public sector pay restraints , need to continue until at least 2018 to balance the books			1
it also coincides with continuing public hostility towards mps over their taxpayer - funded expenses claims and an 11 per cent pay hike promised after the 2015 election			2
however , a senior commons source said last night : ‘ there is no alternative to this			1
it sounds a lot , but it amounts to £ 400million a year over a decade , or £ 200 million over two decades , depending on the timescale for the work , which is peanuts for the @entity49			2
we ca n’t just let the 1,000 - year - old mother of all parliaments fall into ruins			2
’ the row comes after surveyors hired by the @entity56 – the group of mps chaired by speaker @entity58 that supervises its administration – found chronic subsidence in the building , partly linked to the digging of the @entity64 in the 1990s			1
crumbling : surveyors looked over the @entity7 and found that cracks in the walls , fire hazards and safety risks one report found that @entity70 is tilting 18in from the vertical , while cracks have appeared in the walls of the @entity7			2
engineers fear the ancient piping system , including boilers dating from before the @entity76 , is ‘ ready to blow ’ , while the building is also suffering from electrical problems , fire risks and multiple safety hazards			1
they say there needs to be a staged shutdown , section by section , over ten to 20 years while the infrastructure is replaced			0
the £ 4billion cost , which comes as mps prepare to return this week for the @entity88 , would be enough to build 13 hospitals at £ 300 million each			0
the @entity91 chamber itself also needs extensive work and at some point during the next @entity94 will have to be shut for 18 months			0
mps are expected to relocate to the @entity96 , with peers probably meeting in the @entity99 conference centre opposite @entity100			0
relocate : the chamber of the @entity56 will need to close for 18 months during the next parliament building costs at the @entity91 have a history of overrunning			2
when @entity106 , the office building for mps , was designed in 1992 , it was projected to cost £ 165 million , but by the time it was finished in 2001 the bill had spiralled to £ 235 million			1
a spokesman for mr @entity13 said : ‘ these discussions are at a very early stage and the contractors have been asked to report back with more cost - effective options			0
’ last night a @entity49 source said : ‘ a bid of that scale will not be approved			0
’ a @entity91 spokesman said : ‘ in 2012 , a study on the condition of the @entity7 showed that unless significant restoration work is undertaken , irreversible damage may be done to the @entity123			0
both houses agreed that doing nothing was not an option and asked for an independent appraisal of a range of options			0
‘ this appraisal is under way			0
the priority will be to ensure value for money for the taxpayer while safeguarding the heritage of the @entity7			0
the decision will be taken in the next @entity94			0

huge sum is needed to correct ' structural problems ' in ancient building
@entity2 ' reacted with fury ' at demand in time of austerity
but commons sources say there is ' no alternative ' to huge spending plan
