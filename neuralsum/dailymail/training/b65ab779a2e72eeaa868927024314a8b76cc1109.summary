the prime minister is under increasing pressure to secure a freeze in spending from @entity3 rebels , the @entity24 and the voting public			1
but he faces an uphill struggle after it emerged @entity15 officials have begun plotting to secure a budget deal without @entity8			1
the prime minister today insisted @entity18 had to stop ' picking the pockets ' of the public amid reports that @entity15 officials and diplomats are in talks on the legal and financial viability of agreeing a new seven - year budget amongst the 26 member states excluding the @entity8			1
@entity38 said the prime minister ' has been hitting the phones this weekend , speaking to several @entity41 partners as we continue to work constructively to find a deal on the @entity15 's multi-annual budgetary cycle '			1

' i make absolutely no apologies for standing up strongly for @entity8 in @entity41 on some of our priorities , ' the @entity19 said			0
he said in the @entity8 pay and benefits had been frozen and budgets cut , and @entity41 had to do the same			0
' i do n't think it makes you a bad @entity41 because you want a tough budget settlement in @entity41			0
i think it makes you a good @entity41			0
i think i have got the people of @entity41 on my side in arguing that we should stop picking their pockets and spending more and more money through the @entity15 budget , particularly when so many parts of the @entity41 budget are not well spent			2
' the prime minister has pledged to renegotiate the @entity8 ’s relationship with @entity18 and then put that deal to the public			1
he is expected to use a speech before @entity82 to say that would involve a referendum after the next election			0
@entity11 told business leaders at the annual @entity54 conference that tackling @entity18 spending made him a ' good @entity41 ' but mr @entity2 warned that voters would not believe him because he reneged on a ‘ cast iron ’ pledge to hold a referendum on the @entity92			1
‘ nobody believes it and why should they ? ’ he told the @entity97 ’s the @entity96			0
‘ the @entity8 public have been promised a referendum by the three major parties , and every single one has not delivered			0
the public feel they ’ve been lied to – they wo n’t believe any more promises on referendums			0
’ if a referendum were held on the @entity8 's membership of the @entity15 , how do you think you would vote ? 56 % - vote to leave 30 % - vote to remain 14 % - do n't know source : @entity112 / the observer mr @entity2 demanded two referendums : one to win public backing for a shopping list of areas where @entity8 wants to renegotiate , the other to either approve the deal that is thrashed out or to leave the @entity15			1
and he insisted mr @entity11 pass legislation before the next election to ‘ put this in law ’			0
mr @entity2 , said : ‘ there ’s going to be a referendum , whoever ’s in power in the next five years , because the @entity8 public will demand it – they wo n’t put up with it anymore			2
’ he added today that he was prepared to bet ‘ a large sum of money ’ on the @entity8 being out of the @entity15 within a decade if the government was unable to secure major changes on the relationship with @entity18			1
in a speech at @entity55 's @entity139 , the former home secretary called for all justice and home powers to be repatriated permanently along with control over immigration and employment legislation			0
the prime minister is under fire on several fronts over @entity41 last night , facing waves of criticism from @entity3 rebels , @entity152 and voters over his approach to @entity18			1
@entity54 president sir @entity155 added to the pressure today , with a warning that calls for withdrawal from the @entity15 risk ' isolation ' which put trade deals in danger			1
speaking at the opening of the @entity54 annual conference , sir @entity155 said : ' whatever the popular appeal may be of withdrawal , businessmen and politicians must keep a bridge firmly in place			1
call for reform : @entity152 said eurosceptics are right on many issues , including the @entity15 budget , immigration and state aid mr @entity152 said mr @entity11 should be concentrating on ' building alliances ' to secure reforms in the @entity15 ' as countries of @entity41 bind together in pursuit of salvation , we in the @entity8 must work harder to avoid the risks of isolation			1
' as mr @entity11 prepares to attend crunch talks on the @entity15 budget this week , it was reported that @entity15 officials are trying to strike a deal without @entity8 which could see the @entity18 budget rise			1
‘ people are looking , both in national capitals and in @entity18 , for a solution at 26 , ’ an official told the @entity193			0
‘ it is being looked at from a financial and legal point of view			0
’ mr @entity11 has said he is willing to veto any budget deal which he thinks is not in @entity8 's interest			1
but @entity202 , the @entity203 minister without portfolio , warned the stance would mean the @entity15 ignored the @entity15 entirely			1
' if you turn up saying ‘ we ’re not going to agree to anything come what may ’ , which the hard - line people would love him to say , all that happens is they ’ll take no notice of us , ' he told @entity205			2
without agreement on a seven - year deal , the @entity15 would proceed on year - by - year budgets which would cost even more , mr @entity202 added			1
' what we ’re proposing is a freeze for seven years			0
that ’s much tougher than anything we ’ve suggested so far for @entity8 public spending			0
and that ’s a good starting point			2
it gives us a position in negotiations			0
' business secretary @entity228 backed the pm the prime minister to argue the @entity8 's case for a real - terms freeze in the @entity15 budget in a ' forceful way ' mr @entity11 is under pressure to hold to a freeze , after 53 @entity3 rebels backed a @entity238 motion last month calling for a real - terms cut in @entity15 spending			1
mr @entity2 , a leading right - winger , warned that the public believes mr @entity11 has lied to them about the prospects of a referendum			2
he spoke out as a new poll showed that the public overwhelmingly wants him to take a much tougher line with @entity18			0
and in another assault , @entity24 leader mr @entity152 will call for sweeping reforms of the @entity15 budget in an attempt to win over eurosceptic voters			1
mr @entity11 is preparing to demand the @entity15 budget rises by no more than inflation when he attends a summit this week , defying his mps who want to see the budget cut in cash terms			1
but in a blow to mr @entity11 ’s credibility , a @entity257 poll found that 66 per cent of voters want the budget cut			2
the pm has said he thinks the @entity8 should stay part of the @entity15			2
but the poll found that 58 per cent think @entity8 should withdraw if powers can not be restored to @entity265 – a view that is shared by at least ten members of the @entity268			2
some 43 per cent want to pull out of the @entity15 regardless and one in four @entity3 voters is considering voting for the @entity8 @entity270 which advocates withdrawal			1
mr @entity11 will come under further pressure today when @entity273 says he must veto the ‘ amazing ’ demands of the @entity275 for a 5 per cent rise in spending			2
to make matters worse for mr @entity11 , he is now facing a @entity24 leader keen to convince voters that his party is no longer an uncritical admirer of @entity18			2
@entity152 used a speech today to call for reforms to how @entity15 money is spent			2
he said : ‘ for more than three decades our membership of the @entity15 has seemed to be a settled question			0
’ he argued mr @entity11 is the wrong man to reform @entity18 because the growing euroscepticism of the @entity3 party has made it impossible for him to build alliances with other @entity15 countries			1
‘ many of our traditional allies in @entity41 clearly think that @entity8 is heading to the exit door , ’ he said			0
‘ i will not allow our country to sleepwalk toward exit because it would be a betrayal of our national interest			0
‘ we can not afford to use up our energies and alliances on negotiations that will not deliver			0
’ a @entity3 source said : ‘ @entity152 and the @entity24 have zero credibility on negotiating in @entity41			2
‘ they gave up half our rebate and got nothing in return , and approved inflation - busting increases in @entity41 spending at every opportunity			0
’ @entity314 business secretary @entity228 said mr @entity11 was right to argue the @entity8 's case for a real - terms freeze in the @entity15 budget in a ' forceful way '			1
he said : ' the budget proposals are unacceptable			0
i support the hard line , but that does not mean i am anti-europe - quite the opposite			0

56 per cent would vote for @entity8 to leave the @entity15 in a referendum , opinion poll finds
