this is the spectacular moment millions of red crabs on a remote in the @entity3 began their migration to breed more of the fire - coloured creatures			1
a sea of red moves on @entity8 , 2,500km north - west of @entity9 , from the forests to the @entity3 where the crustaceans will mate			2
it specialist and amateur photographer @entity12 , 53 , from @entity9 , captured the start of the migration two weeks ago and saw ' the crabs just pour out of the jungle and take over '			2
' the speed with which everything on the island changes is incredible			0
on tuesday ( nov 18 ) the weather started out fine and there was maybe one or two crabs around , ' said mr @entity12			0
' in the afternoon , storms came through and that evening the red crabs were out in force			1
the island had evolved into a red carpet ; a sea of red as the crabs started heading down to the @entity3 , ' he said			2
the crabs move in their crimson wave to and from their breeding ground and habitat , as the crabs gradually move down to the ocean to spawn			0
' a few weeks later , the spawn return and a shimmering carpet of small tiny one inch crabs returns to the jungle , ' mr @entity12 said			2
an estimated 120 million red crabs live on the 52 square mile island shared with just more than 2,000 residents			1
the bright display of natural wonder forces roads on the island to close , allowing the crabs to cross and bringing the island to a standstill			1
' but the majority of areas are off limits for a few months for all vehicles , ' said mr @entity12			0
' where cars do travel , everyone is weaving around to avoid the crabs and sometimes it 's probably quicker to walk , ' he said			0
' they bring many things on the island to a halt , whole swathes of the rain forest , tourist style areas , beaches and trails are closed			0
' @entity8 has a population of just over 2,000 residents , and since the 1980 's has been used by the @entity79 government to process asylum seekers off shore			0
the incredible sight attracts thousands of islanders to see the phenomenon , which lasts several weeks as the 14 different species of crabs take over the island the bright display of natural wonder forces roads on the island to close , allowing the crabs to cross and bringing the island to a standstill the crabs move in their crimson wave to and from their breeding ground and habitat , as the crabs gradually move down to the ocean to spawn ' the speed with which everything on the island changes is incredible , ' said mr @entity12 ' a few weeks later , the spawn return and a shimmering carpet of small tiny one inch crabs returns to the jungle , ' mr @entity12 said			1
