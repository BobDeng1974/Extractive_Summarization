the quest for a device that will allow humans to soar like birds has led to some strange contraptions over the years			0
but this one could outdo even the most bizarre designs – and you do n’t even have to take off from the ground to use it			0
the @entity10 machine lets you flap your way through the air in a similar way to the red kite that it ’s modelled after			0
meanwhile , an @entity25 headset provides a stomach - churning bird - eye - view of the flight			1
if that was n’t enough , the system also replicates the headwinds that a red kite would face using a fan			1
could this take off ? the @entity10 machine lets you flap your way through the air in a similar way to the red kite that it 's modelled after birds - eye - view : developed by the @entity18 , a motor translate hand movements from simulator into the flapping of virtual avian wings users will even smell whatever landscape they ’re flying over			1
‘ soundwise you perceive only the roaring of the wind and the flaps of the wings , ’ the designers write on their website			2
‘ the olfactoric feedback is based on the location which the bird flies over in the scenery and ranges from the scent of a forest , soil , to several other odours of the wilderness			0
’ the designers claim that @entity60 still needs some changes to avoid making the user feel sick			0
however , the machine is primarily an art installation and there are no plans to commercialise it			0
the device is the latest in a range of concepts designed to make use of the ultra-realistic @entity73 headset			1
do n't look down : an @entity25 headset provides a stomach = churning bird - eye - view of the flight for instance , the @entity78 is trialling a system that uses the @entity73 headset to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch			1
cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset , creating the illusion that the tank is ‘ transparent			0
another project is used the @entity73 headset to let you can experience all the loops , jumps and speed of @entity98 in first - person			1
the @entity78 is trialling a system that uses the @entity73 headset to drive armoured vehicles , pictured			1
soldiers can wear the headset , and use it drive the tank , above or below the hatch and it has been designed to protect them from gunfire and remove driving blindspots @entity111 's virtual world was given the go ahead earlier this year when their $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) deal to buy @entity25 headset firm @entity25 was approved			2
@entity25 was founded by 21 - year - old college dropout @entity73			1
the firm is developing the leading vr headset - with a developer version on sale for $ 350 ( £ 210 ) it will first be used for immersive games , but @entity111 ceo @entity121 promised the headset will ' change the way we work , play and communicate			2
' but virtual worlds could include advertising admitted @entity121 the purchase of @entity25 put @entity111 in a battle with @entity129 , who have already unveiled their own version of a @entity25 headset , destined for the @entity133 next year			2
meanwhile , @entity135 broadband provider @entity134 recently unveiled its intriguing experiment			0
they programmed the headset to experience internet lag in real life , to give users an idea of what it would be like to live in a world where things buffer like an online video			2
the experiment is called ' living with lag ' and sees four volunteers going through activities while using an @entity73 together with a @entity152 , webcam and noise - cancelling headphones			1
together , this combination can simulate different levels of lag , from a brief 0.33 seconds to a more frustrating three seconds			0
the results are rather hilariously shown in their video , which includes the volunteers struggling to dance and play table tennis .			0
