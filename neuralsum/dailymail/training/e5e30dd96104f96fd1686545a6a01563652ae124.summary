you watch him on tv at the @entity29 and you can see he is a class act on and off the pitch			2
' you will always have doubters who say he 's finished but i back my judgment			1
@entity35 turned the club round for me at @entity37			2
i had @entity38 and @entity39 when everyone was saying he was finished and he was the best centre half in the @entity42 when he was with me			0
' he had other offers too			0
he could 've gone to two top @entity6 clubs who wanted to speak to him			1
' there he might have played and not played , but he wanted to come here			0
i ca n't say who they were but that 's 100 per cent fact			2

he added : ' i spoke to @entity58 , not that i had any doubts , and he told me if he had still been manager this season @entity24 would have been his number one centre half			0
' when he had that spell in charge the first thing he did was put @entity24 in the team			0
he was fit all season			0
it was just a case of @entity69 ( @entity70 ) going in and turning a few things around			0
he was one of the four or five fittest players at the club			0
' elsewhere , @entity1 also confirmed that @entity74 will remain with the west @entity75 this season after uncertainty over his future			1
the 27 - year - old spent last season on loan at @entity81 , but missed a prolonged part of the campaign after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament			0
