by @entity0 published : 00:21 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 03:59 est , 3 march 2014 focusing on sporting success is a waste of time because ' very , very few children ' are going to make it , an academic has said			1
@entity8 , a professor of culture , media and sport at @entity12 , says there is little proof that the @entity15 create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy			1
and he believes it is high time parents realised children are more likely to make the finals of shows like @entity23 and @entity25 ’s @entity24 than become sporting heroes of any sort			1
@entity29 's winners @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 pose with their medals ' we should n’t be trying to channel all of our energy into this pursuit of excellence in sports when very , very few children are going to succeed at any kind of level at all , ' he said			1
' my answer to parents who tell me their child might become a leading footballer or athlete is that they are putting them at risk of serious injury or closer to the world of performance - enhancing drugs			2
' i ask them : " are you happy about that ? " and they say : " it wo n’t happen to my child "			2
' to which i reply : " but it goes with the territory "			2
the cheats are very often those at the top			2
@entity8 says there is little proof that the @entity15 create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy ' do we want to churn out one - dimensional characters who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of excellence ? ' prof @entity8 is also concerned that the behaviour of elite sportsmen is filtering down to grass roots			1
' schools are now trying to apply an industrial model instead of encouraging children to enjoy sport without being competitive , ' he said			1
' at football matches , parents treat their children like interns in a concentration camp			1
' i feel like saying to them : " your son is trying to enjoy himself , by the way ! "			0
' prof @entity8 , who has written books about @entity93 and @entity94 , reveals he once fancied himself as a middle distance runner with @entity96 – until he realised he ' was n’t very good ’			1
he played football until he was 40 , has tried ice rinks but not skiing , and believes in sport as a useful means of recreation			1
but he added : ' @entity102 sportsmen are terrifyingly narrow , often unable to talk about anything else except their sport			1
' i just used to try			0
i was an honest trier , a toiler			0
' @entity25 ’s @entity108 success , he argues , is such a flash in the pan that it will have no effect on the nation ’s youth whatsover			0
' you could stop 100 people in the street and ask them to name any of the competitors			0
you ’d be hard - pressed to find anyone who could , ' he said			0
' the level of awareness of the @entity108 is zero and nobody was in the slightest bit interested			0
' even if you asked 1,000 people , probably only two or three of could name anyone			0
because these were not games for ordinary people			0
prof @entity8 also poured scorn on @entity130 's ' @entity15 legacies ' ' so why do we spend all of this money training people to do something we are not very good at ? “ is there anybody out there who wants so much taxpayer ’s money spent on sports that will only be enjoyed by a tiny minority of a minority ? ' after studying the @entity108 medal table – @entity145 got 33 ( 13 of them gold ) , @entity148 26 ( 11 ) , @entity149 25 ( 10 ) , @entity150 28 ( 9 ) , @entity151 24 ( 8 ) , @entity152 19 ( 8 ) , @entity153 11 ( 6 ) and @entity25 4 ( 1 ) – prof @entity8 added : ' how did we get to the point that one gold , one silver and two bronzes is somehow a success when we are just not very good at winter games ? ' the medals table proves the @entity108 is for affluent countries – and where are the black athletes ? ' in six months time people will have forgotten all about curling			1
they wo n’t even know what it means			0
' then there was the huge cost of covering something that i , and many others , did n’t watch a single minute of			0
prof @entity8 also poured scorn on @entity130 ’s ‘ @entity15 legacies ’			1
' over the years that word has mutated from meaning rejuvenating slums , new facilities and hospitals to creating more sportsmen , ' he explained			0
' the only increased take - up of a sport after @entity182 has been women ’s boxing , so there ’s a lot of people who find all of that a bit ambivalent			2
' the newspapers and television were bigging up the @entity108 , but i did n’t hear anyone on the street talking about them			0
' the @entity194 recently showed that 33 per cent of pupils aged 10 to11 in 2012 - 13 were obese or overweight , and 22 per cent of children in reception classes were overweight .			2
