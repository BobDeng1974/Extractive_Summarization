by @entity0 solar power has had a difficult start on @entity3 thanks to inefficient panels and high costs			1
but in space , scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy			2
now , the space - based solar power – once merely the stuff of science - fiction – could be available sooner than expected if @entity15 has its way			1
within 25 years , the country plans to make space - based solar power a reality , according to a proposal from the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
solar power has had a difficult start on @entity3			2
but in space , scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy			0
by the end of this year , @entity15 expects to perform a ground experiment in which a beam of hundreds of watts will be transmitted over about 164ft ( 50 metres ) the agency has outlined its plans to create a 1 - gigawatt commercial system for space - based solar power , which would provide about the same output as a nuclear power plant			1
in a recent @entity42 article by @entity43 , a professor emeritus at @entity21 , he outlined the agency ’s plans create a 1.8 mile long ( 3 km ) man - made island in the harbour of @entity48			1
the island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity			1
the microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the @entity3			1
to collect the solar energy , two large mirrors would be positioned to direct light onto photovoltaic panels the microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the @entity3			1
pictured are artist 's impressions of what the system may look like to collect the solar energy , two large mirrors would be positioned to direct light onto photovoltaic panels 24 hours a day			0
in a separate porject , a @entity15 firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on @entity3			1
@entity76 's @entity76 project would stretch almost 6,790 miles ( 11,000km ) around the moon 's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt			0
energy captured by these panels would then be sent to @entity3 using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed			1
according to the plans , the project would produce around 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy			0
the company claims the plans would not only provide an ' almost inexhaustible ' energy supply , it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources			0
a separate substation on the island would send electricity coursing through a submarine cable to @entity48 , to help keep the neon lights of @entity105 shining			2
‘ a combination of technical and social factors is giving it currency , especially in @entity15 , ’ said professor @entity43			0
‘ on the technical front , recent advances in wireless power transmission allow moving antennas to coordinate in order to send a precise beam across vast distances			2
‘ at the same time , heightened public concerns about the climatic effects of greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels are prompting a look at alternatives			0
’ @entity15 has a particular interest in finding a practical clean energy source : the accident at the @entity128 nuclear power plant prompted an exhaustive search for alternatives			1
however @entity15 lacks both fossil fuel resources and empty land suitable for renewable power installations			2
by the end of this year , researchers expect to perform a ground experiment in which a beam of hundreds of watts will be transmitted over about 164ft ( 50 metres )			1
each panel will transmit @entity140 , so that the total beam will carry 1.6 @entity142			0
in this early - stage experiment , @entity21 hopes to achieve a power output of 350 w. @entity76 plans to install a 250 - mile - wide field of solar panels on the moon 's equator ( concept image pictured )			1
energy from these panels would be sent to @entity3 using microwaves and laser lights and the company claims the system would be an ' almost inexhaustible ' source of power ‘ some people have a grisly mental image of roasted seagulls dropping from the sky			2
in fact , the beam would n’t even be intense enough to heat your coffee , ’ said professor @entity43			0

@entity76 's @entity76 project would stretch almost 6,790 miles ( 11,000km ) around the moon 's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt			0
energy captured by these panels would then be sent to @entity3 using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed			2
according to the plans , the project would produce around 13,000 terrawatts of continuous solar energy			0
at present , the world 's population consumes about 15 terawatts of power each year			0
the company claims the plans would not only provide an ' almost inexhaustible ' energy supply , it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources			0
this graphic explains @entity76 's master plan for its @entity76 scheme			0
according to the plans , the project would produce around 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy which could be sent directly to countries when needed			0

this would provide about the same output as a nuclear power plant
it will do this by creating a 1.8 m ( 3 km ) island in the harbour of @entity48
island would be studded with 5 *bn* antennas to convert microwave energy
the microwaves would beamed down from giant solar collectors in space
by 2015 , @entity15 expects to perform a ground experiment in which a beam of hundreds of watts will be transmitted over about 164ft ( 50 metres )
