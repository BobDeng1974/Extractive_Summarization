archaeologists in @entity1 have begun uncovering an extraordinary alfresco gallery of prehistoric art high in the 4,506 - metre tall @entity4			1
while the region is famed for petroglyphs ( rock engravings ) , new finds are being made in the hidden and rarely - visited @entity10 valley , close to the fast - flowing @entity11			1
here beneath the densely - wooded slopes they are discovering remarkable rock pictures dating back 5,000 years , close to @entity16 's border with @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity20 scenery : the 4,506 - metre tall @entity4 in southern @entity1 are one of the great undiscovered tourist destinations of the world , featuring breathtaking lakes and peaks			1
the mountain range in @entity27 is known as the @entity28 archaeologists in @entity1 have begun uncovering an extraordinary alfresco gallery of prehistoric art in the mountains further searches for this ancient treasure trove will go ahead after the snow melts next year			1
professor @entity35 , from the @entity36 at the @entity28 branch of the @entity38 , said : ' the total number of petroglyphs in @entity10 is several thousand , both separate images and whole compositions			1
' this area is very rarely visited by researchers			0
therefore , we can confidently say that it is one of the few places in the mountains where we 're still waiting for sensational discoveries to be made			0
' reaching the artwork here is a task in itself , with the area separated from the outside world by the high jagged peaks of the @entity57 pass			0
roads in this region are almost non-existent and with no mobile phone signal , nor an modern civilisation close at hand , it can feel extremely isolated - yet this artwork suggest this was a hub of human creativity in millennia gone by			2
' it is a place unlike any other and is , arguably , one of the greatest art galleries anywhere in the world			2
yet you wo n't find masterpieces in the traditional sense here , with no rembrandts , @entity76 , or @entity78 's anywhere in sight , ' said @entity80			2
' sensational discoveries ' : the artwork suggest this was a hub of human creativity in millennia gone by rarely visited area : archaeologists say that they are ' still waiting for sensational discoveries to be made ' in the @entity10 valley the @entity4 in southern @entity1 are one of the great undiscovered tourist destinations , featuring breathtaking lakes and peaks , with many signs of the ancient lost world , such as burial mounds , standing stones and the exhibition of petroglyphs , many from the @entity102 and @entity103 ages			0
many of the carvings are found on rocks that form a symbolic rock garden , with the sun 's beams helping to illuminate the artistic work and making them appear similar to photograph negatives			1
according to @entity115 legend , the location of these megaliths was a result of the mythical hero @entity117 , who is said to have jokingly changed the direction of the rivers and scattered the mountain valleys with huge rocks			2
archaeologists studying the petroglyphs found that the ancient artists had several favourite images , including the @entity28 mountain goat , which has always been seen as a symbol of success and good luck as well as being good hunting prey			1
another of the most popular images at @entity10 is the long horned bull , a symbol of a bygone era that once roamed in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity27			2
archaeologists studying the petroglyphs found that the artists had several favourite images , including the @entity28 mountain goat reaching the artwork is a task in itself , with the area separated from the outside world by the high jagged peaks of the @entity147 pass drawings depict deer , shown with strangely disproportionate large sizes of horns and a snout that resembled a bird 's beak fascinating impressions : another of the most popular images at @entity10 is the long horned bull , a symbol of a bygone era searching for a meaning : archaeologists are still puzzled as to why the ancient civilisations carved the images in the first place ancient art : these pictures highlight the fact that the world 's artists were already hard at work many millennia ago drawings dating from the early nomadic era depict deer , shown with strangely disproportionate large sizes of horns and a snout that resembled a bird 's beak			1
what is perhaps most interesting about these depictions is that similar petroglyphs have been found as far afield as @entity18 and @entity180 , showing that even in ancient times certain ideas and styles travelled a considerable distance			1
other carvings depict hunters standing beside the beasts with their bows and arrows			0
yet archaeologists are still puzzled as to why the ancient civilisations carved the images in the first place			0
some say they were drawn as signs of rituals dedicated to the gods or spirits , to help them fatten up their cattle , others believe they are simply depictions of hunting parties			0
another theory is that the carvings showed where the best hunting trails lay			0
the truth is , no one will truly know			0
yet , whatever else these pictures show , they highlight the fact that the world 's artists were already hard at work many millennia ago .			0
