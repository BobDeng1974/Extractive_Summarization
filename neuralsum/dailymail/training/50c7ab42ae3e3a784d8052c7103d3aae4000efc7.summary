a @entity1 doctor working in @entity2 has described the horror he and his team have witnessed since the deadly @entity6 outbreak struck			1
dr @entity7 , along with a team of @entity1 medics , was working to strengthen the health system in the country 's capital @entity13 when the crisis took hold earlier			1
when disaster struck , they decided to stay and ' do everything they could ' to help - despite health workers being among those most at risk of contracting the virus			1
today , dr @entity7 , 28 , described the crippling conditions the team work in - and the opposition they face from locals who believe the disease may be a government conspiracy			1
he and his team were working to build and strengthen the health system in the country 's capital			1
today he described the horror the disease has caused he said : ' we 're all aware that there is a risk and that we have to be extremely careful			1
however , we also know that if we wear the protective equipment properly and follow the protocols then we 'll be ok			2
' that does n't leave room for error , however - such as an accidental scratch of the face or forgotten hand wash			2
' as we get used to it , we all begin to relax - the risk then is making sure that you do n't cut corners or get too confident			0
' but he admitted the working conditions wearing the suits were far from anything the team had experienced before			1
' i first wore the protective suits during a bit of an emergency , so did n't have much time to reflect on it			1
' the heat of the suits is quickly overwhelming , as your goggles steam up and you feel the sweat dripping underneath			1
and the smell of chlorine is intense			2
' dr @entity7 , 28 , is working in @entity13 as part of the @entity76 scheme			1
the initiative is a partnership between @entity79 's and @entity80 ' , @entity81 and @entity32 and @entity82 as well as @entity83			0
he added : ' what shocking is how healthy the patients look before they die and how quickly they decline			1
' a number of the @entity6 patients i 've seen look quite fit and healthy and can be walking around until shortly before their deaths			1
' dr @entity7 also described the difficulties of working in the country - which is recovering from years of brutal civil war - because many thought the illness was a government conspiracy			1
deep fear among patients and their families saw some trying to escape hospital , he said			2
' @entity6 is a new disease in @entity2 and when the first cases emerged , many people thought it might be a government conspiracy to undermine certain tribal groups , steal organs or get money from international donors			1
' this links to widely held scepticism about @entity109 medicine and traditional beliefs and practices			0
' relatives do n't get to see what happens to patients when they are isolated , so some expressed fears that they were being taken away to be killed by doctors			2
' they do n't get to see the good facilities and great care that patients i see every day receive			2
' that meant some patients resisted being isolated and would try to run away or be carried off by family members			2
' this is a constant challenge even now , and presents real ethical dilemmas about whether we can or should restrain patients - and logistical ones about how it 's even possible to safely restrain an infectious patient without putting yourself at risk			2
' he admits he ' definitely hesitated ' when he was first confronted with a probable case of @entity6 ( it takes a few days to get lab confirmation )			1
where a victim has breaks in the skin , blood seeps out , as the disease takes hold			2
the virus has a death rate of up to 90 per cent , and is highly - contagious , spreading through contact with an infected person 's blood , secretions , organs and other bodily fluids ' your instinct as a doctor is to rush in and help , but you know you ca n't touch a patient until you 're fully protected , he explained			0
the first symptoms include a fever , headache and sore throat			0
within days as the ebola virus attacks the immune system , chronic abdominal pain , muscle aches , vomiting and diarrhoea take hold			0
the virus pierces blood vessels causing bleeding from the eyes , ears , mouth and other orifices			0
the whites of the eyes turn red and blood blisters form under the skin			0
@entity6 is highly - infectious and has a death rate of up to 90 per cent ' our families are often very concerned , and convincing them that we 'll be okay can be hard			1
' before the outbreak swept the country @entity183 , from @entity32 , had worked with @entity185 colleagues to help prepare for the worst - advising how to identify cases , set up isolation units , how to protect staff and providing refresher training for local health workers			0
when cases started to emerge , the team had to ask themselves whether or not they should stay in the country to help with the response - their initial mission was to help strengthen the health system , not to provide a humanitarian response to an epidemic			1
the team is made up of two consultants , two junior doctors , two nurses , a pharmacist and a hospital manager are all staff and volunteers			2
they chose to stay and help local health workers			0
dr @entity7 said : ' from the moment we heard about the first @entity6 cases , all of our instincts on the team here and back in @entity32 were to do everything we could to help our colleagues overcome this new challenge			1
' we have very close relationships with our colleagues at @entity220 and the @entity221 and always try to respond to their requests for support			0
' it was also clear that this new threat was something that they had n't faced before and would require technical advice , extra manpower and trusted friends			0
' we 're not a humanitarian non-governmental organisation however , so of course we then had to go through the process of articulating this and agreeing it as a group - there was never opposition though and we 've always had consensus			0
' latest figures from the @entity242 show the outbreak of the deadly virus in western @entity185 has infected more than 1,300 people latest figures from the @entity242 show the outbreak of the deadly virus in western @entity185 has infected more than 1,300 people and killed at least 729			0
@entity6 has no vaccine and there is no cure			1
the outbreak has centred on @entity2 , @entity252 and @entity253			0
there has also been particular concern after densely populated @entity256 reported what is thought to be its first death from the disease			0
the team have been based at @entity261 in @entity13 for the last 18 months			1
they were initially working to help strengthen the health system of the country through improving aspects such as training , health policy , research and hospital management , before the first cases of the deadly virus started to emerge in neighbouring @entity253 and @entity252			0
dr @entity7 said that it was hoped that the country had ' dodged a bullet ' - but @entity2 confirmed its first ever case of @entity6 on may 25			1
' even as the outbreak spread to @entity252 there had been some hope that it might pass us by , ' he said			0
' we 've now been hit hard though			0
initially the disease was relatively well contained in the east but we 've now seen cases in 1 districts			0
hopefully these are isolated cases , but it 's still a bit early to tell for sure			0
