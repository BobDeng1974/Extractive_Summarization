by @entity0 you may think a cheetah would be hard to beat , but researchers have found that , for its size , a tiny @entity5 beetle is actually the fastest animal ever found			2
@entity8 is no bigger than a sesame seed - however , it was recently recorded running at up to 322 body lengths per second			1
the previous record - holder , the @entity14 tiger beetle , only reached 171 body lengths per second , while a cheetah running at 60 miles per hour attains only reaches 16 body lengths per second			1
@entity8 is no bigger than a sesame seed - however , it was recently recorded running at up to 322 body lengths per second , equivalent to a person running roughly 1300 miles per hour			1
the mite is local to @entity5 and is often found running along rocks or sidewalks			1
although it was first identified in 1916 , little is known about its habits or food sources			2
the mites also are adept at stopping and changing directions extremely quickly , attributes the researchers are investigating further for potential insights that may be relevant to bioengineering applications			2
extrapolated to the size of a human , the mite ’s speed is equivalent to a person running roughly 1300 miles per hour			1
the @entity5 college student who spent a summer chasing down the remarkable mites says the discovery is exciting not only because it sets a new world record , but also for what it reveals about the physiology of movement and the physical limitations of living structures			0
' it ’s so cool to discover something that ’s faster than anything else , and just to imagine , as a human , going that fast compared to your body length is really amazing , ' said @entity56 , a junior and physics major at @entity58			1
' but beyond that , looking deeper into the physics of how they accomplish these speeds could help inspire revolutionary new designs for things like robots or biomimetic devices			0
' @entity56 ’s advisor , @entity67 , @entity68 , a professor of biology at @entity71 , became interested in the mites while studying the effect of muscle biochemistry on how quickly animals can move their legs			0
but it was n’t until @entity56 and other students documented the mites ’ running speeds in their natural environment that the research team knew they had found a new world record			1
the previous record - holder , the @entity14 tiger beetle , only reached 171 body lengths per second , while , a cheetah running at 60 miles per hour attains only about 16 body lengths per second			1
both relative speed and stride frequency increase as animals get smaller , and in theory , muscle physiology should at some point limit how fast a leg can move			0
' we were looking at the overarching question of whether there is an upper limit to the relative speed or stride frequency that can be achieved , ” said @entity67			0
“ when the values for mites are compared with data from other animals , they indicate that , if there is an upper limit , we have n't found it yet			0
” the mite is local to @entity5 and is often found running along rocks or sidewalks			1
although it was first identified in 1916 , little is known about its habits or food sources			0

the research team used high - speed cameras to record the mites ’ sprints in the laboratory and in their natural environment			0
' it was actually quite difficult to catch them , and when we were filming outside , you had to follow them incredibly quickly as the camera ’s field of view is only about 10 centimeters across , ' said @entity56			0
the research team was also surprised to find the mites running on concrete up to 140 degrees @entity135 ( 60 degrees @entity136 ) , a temperature significantly higher than the upper lethal temperature of most animals			1
' they ’re operating at temperatures that seem to preclude activities of any other animal group			0
' we ’ve seen them running where there were no other animals visibly active , ' said @entity67			2
the mites also are adept at stopping and changing directions extremely quickly , attributes the researchers are investigating further for potential insights that may be relevant to bioengineering applications .			0
