by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 04:31 est , 4 may 2012 mps yesterday called for an urgent investigation into the @entity4 ’s role in the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008			1
the institution ’s governor , sir @entity6 , admitted this week that he should have done more ‘ to prevent the disaster ’ – the worst since the 1930s			1
@entity10 , a senior @entity11 mp who sits on the @entity12 , said a probe could not ‘ come soon enough ’			1
sir @entity6 said he was not ' scared ' of an inquiry into the @entity4 taking place , telling the @entity16 he would be ' very happy ' if it did he added : ‘ hard - working families and the wider @entity19 economy will suffer for some years yet from the catastrophically poor judgment and buck - passing that preceded the banking crash			1
‘ yet individuals who are suspected of being asleep on the job are to be given draconian and unprecedented powers this year			0
’ the @entity11 chairman of the committee , @entity26 , said : ‘ @entity28 is taking on considerable new powers in the @entity30 , currently before @entity31			2
‘ yet we still do not have firm and agreed conclusions about the mistakes that were made and which the legislation is , presumably , seeking to address			0
’ @entity36 , a @entity37 member of the committee , called on sir @entity6 to apologise for the @entity4 ’s handling of the credit crunch			1
demand : @entity11 mp @entity10 said a major investigation ' can not come soon enough ' ‘ there certainly should be an inquiry into the @entity4 ’s mistakes and it is a shame that sir @entity6 has rebuffed the proposal in the past , ’ he added			1
‘ we need to know where the @entity4 failed , and why			2
we also need to look at his role , because he was a big part of the problem			0
’ in a @entity16 interview yesterday , sir @entity6 was accused of being ‘ scared ’ of a large - scale inquiry into the @entity4 ’s conduct before , during and after the crisis			1
he brushed off the suggestion and insisted he would be ‘ very happy ’ if a probe took place			0
sir @entity6 insisted however that the first and only inquiry by the @entity4 , in 2008 , was sufficient			1
‘ the important thing is whether you learn the lessons			0
and we have done that , ’ he added			0
treasury sources said @entity67 was ‘ relaxed ’ about the prospects of an inquiry but that it was a ‘ matter for the bank ’			2
both the @entity12 and the @entity72 have conducted major inquiries without apportioning blame			0

sir @entity6 caused controversy yesterday by saying the @entity84 had given a ‘ textbook response ’ to the economic crisis			1
other mps have said people should know ' where the @entity4 failed and why ' he said the balance struck between spending cuts and deficit reduction was ‘ perfectly sensible ’ and only soaring inflation had prevented a return to growth			2
his comments enraged @entity37 because the governor is supposed to be politically neutral , especially on a polling day			0
@entity99 , a @entity37 member of the @entity100 , said : ‘ this is a very unwise intervention by the governor			0
he has been less than forthcoming about the @entity4 ’s mistakes			2
’ sir @entity6 also claimed banks were able to get away with awarding excessive bonuses because taxpayers ’ cash guarantees they can not go under .			1

bank governor sir @entity6 insists he is ' not scared ' at prospect of inquiry
@entity11 mp @entity10 says investigation into @entity4 ' can not come soon enough '
