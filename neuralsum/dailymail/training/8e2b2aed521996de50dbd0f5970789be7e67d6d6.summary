' mr @entity23 , 43 , was thumped in the face and sent crashing to the ground after trying to shake @entity15 ’s hand saying : ' what ’s a bomb ?

' @entity23 was vulnerable through drink whereas the defendant is well built , physically fit and strong			1
mr @entity23 was inoffensively telling him his problems			1
the defendant ’s reaction was to deliver this punch			2
' @entity110 @entity109 was told in the days before the tragedy on june 14 @entity15 attacked ‘ men he did n’t know from @entity115 ’ , leaving them prone in the street			1
@entity8 footage was shown in court of @entity15 unleashing a vicious blow to the face of 30 - year - old @entity120 at a bus stop on @entity122 , @entity39 - because he had put his arm around @entity125 and a female friend			1
a few seconds pass before mr @entity120 is knocked off his feet by the punch , hitting his head on a nearby wall leaving him unconscious			2
@entity15 can be then seen walking calmly away while a number of youths run quickly across the @entity135 video evidence was served of the incident on june 11 at @entity39 bus station , where @entity15 punched 41 - year - old @entity83 with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance			1

he bumped into @entity15 who had been watching movies with friends on an @entity153 at around 8pm			0
mr @entity23 made innocuous remarks expressing his sadness that two of his friends had recently committed suicide			1

leave me alone or i ’ll fall out with you			0
' mr @entity23 , sensing trouble , offered his hand for @entity15 to shake and apologised but the teenager laughed and said ‘ if you do n’t f * * * off i will bomb you			1
' one eye witness told the jury : ' @entity169 asked the man to stop talking about suicide , but he would n’t listen			2
@entity169 was getting annoyed , his face dropped			0
' he was getting aggressive			0
he was bouncing up and down on his toes			0
we could tell he was angry by the fact his face went red and serious and he was smiling before			0
' the man asked @entity169 what he meant by his threat to “ bomb ” him and i was shocked when @entity181 hit him			0
' it was horrible , all you could hear was his head thump			0
the man had turned his head around and asked what a bomb was , he was n’t aggressive			0

@entity23 was taken by ambulance to @entity206 where he was later pronounced dead he pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm			2
after the case detective chief inspector @entity92 , of @entity93 , said : ' @entity23 lost his life at the hands of a young thug , who was driven by aggression and pent - up violence and revelled in the fact that he could knock vulnerable people unconscious with a single punch , which he referred to as his " bomb "			1
' like all cowards and bullies he targeted people who he knew could not defend themselves or fight back			0
twice in the previous week he had knocked vulnerable men to the ground with a single punch for no reason whatsoever			2
' it is was tragic way for @entity23 ’s evening to end			2
it has left his father and family devastated			0
my thoughts are with them and i hope that the justice delivered today will provide some comfort to them			0
' i hope this incident serves as a timely reminder of the real dangers to life involved when people throw a punch			0
too many people have lost their lives in such incidents			0
i would urge people to think before they ever contemplate throwing a punch , you could cost someone their life and spend the rest of your own in a prison cell			0
” prosecutor @entity254 said : ' mr @entity23 had the misfortune to come across @entity125 and what followed was a tragic , unprovoked and thoroughly unnecessary attack by @entity15 when instead he could simply have walked away			2
' @entity8 footage was shown at the trial as bad character evidence , this depicted the escalating pattern of violence that @entity15 demonstrated in the week leading up to this fateful night should act as a severe warning to those who may be inclined to follow @entity15 ’s bad example			2
' whilst today ’s conviction of @entity125 is a successful outcome in terms of justice , it does not bring back mr @entity23 or remove the grief and distress felt by his family and friends			2
our thoughts are with them			0
