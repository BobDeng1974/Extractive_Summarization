the @entity8 wants older people to receive a colour - coded letter each year that will clearly explain all their tax codes , in a victory for a long - running @entity14 campaign			1
the @entity8 slammed the current system that bombards pensioners with different tax codes , leaving them unsure how much tax they should pay			1
the codes , which consist of a series of letters and numbers that few people except accountants understand , dictate how much money one can receive before paying tax			1
as a result , many get a nasty shock when they open a letter from @entity31 demanding taxes they did not know they owed			0
the @entity8 ’s report , published yesterday after an 18 - month investigation , said it is wrong that retirement for many pensioners means a move from ‘ simple to complex ’ tax affairs			1
it follows a long - running @entity14 campaign to make the tax system easier for pensioners to navigate			1
many people are never responsible for their tax affairs when they were working , under the pay - as - you - earn system			1
as a result , when they retire they are often overwhelmed by @entity31 sending them different tax codes for each source of income , such as their pensions and interest from savings			0
the @entity8 has now proposed a new ‘ @entity57 ’ letter for pensioners , which would ‘ outline the code for each source of income ’ that will apply to the following tax year			1
its report states : ‘ this would enable pensioners to check more easily that their tax affairs were correct and would reduce the anxiety of receiving multiple [ tax code ] notices without a clear understanding of how they are connected			1
’ it is also calling for a new ‘ @entity72 ’ form to be sent every april , which would explain how much pensioners should have been taxed on their income in the previous tax year			1
in a controversial move , it has also proposed that the 10 per cent savings rate , which allows people to pay lower tax on savings income of up to £ 2,710 a year , should be scrapped			1
the @entity8 has now proposed a new ' form @entity57 ' letter for pensioners , which would ' outline the code for each source of income ' that will apply to the following tax year the @entity8 says it should be removed because ‘ awareness and claim levels are so low that it is ineffective in incentivising savings ’ – but @entity31 figures show around 525,000 people , including many pensioners , claim the rebate , worth about £ 90 a year			1
the @entity8 called for the annual tax - free @entity90 limit , currently £ 11,280 for a share - based account , to be given a one - off increase to offset the impact of this change			1
it has not proposed how big this should be , but @entity96 , of the @entity8 ’s consulting committee , said there is a ‘ good argument ’ for a £ 5,000 rise			2
the @entity8 was set up in july 2010 , soon after the @entity101 came to power			2
its proposals must be approved by the chancellor , who could announce his decision in the @entity106 in march			0
a @entity108 spokesman said : ‘ the government is committed to simplifying the tax system and ensuring it is straightforward and easy to comply with			2
we will respond to [ the @entity8 ’s ] recommendations at the appropriate time			2
’ tax for pensioners is a minefield			2
the gradual introduction of allowances , credits , tax breaks and new rates have made the system convoluted and complicated			2
every year , thousands are landed with shock bills because @entity31 has failed to deduct the right amount of money from their income			0
in 2011 , @entity14 handed a dossier of complaints about the system to @entity131 , the top accountant who was appointed head of the @entity8			1
every year , thousands are landed with shock bills because @entity31 has failed to deduct the right amount of money from their income this described how the retired were baffled that the state pension is taxable , but paid without tax being deducted			0
there was also huge confusion over the 10p tax rate paid on up to £ 2,710 of savings interest			0
but by far the biggest problem stemmed from the reams of tax codes sent out by @entity31 every year			0
a typical pensioner may have two company pensions , the state pension , and income from savings ; there will be different codes for each , which may change two or three times a year			0
workers who have spent their whole life in the @entity157 system are suddenly expected to understand these , and know when they are wrong			0
it ’s like learning a new language late in life			0
the proposal to clarify tax codes is a giant stride to making life easier			0
it will give pensioners a clearer picture of how much tax they are paying , and help to spot mistakes earlier			2
it should also cut down on unexpected bills which many struggle to pay			0
however , in calling for the end of the 10p rate of tax on savings income , the @entity8 is in danger of stripping away benefits from pensioners at a time when their incomes are already severely squeezed – as it did when it proposed the removal of higher tax - free allowances for the over- 65s , a policy that became known as the ‘ granny tax ’			1
the @entity8 says the 10p rate is too complex , and that the £ 50million it costs should be spent on higher @entity90 allowances for everyone			2
however , 525,000 save an average of £ 90 a year because of the 10p rate			0
scrapping it would mean taking cash from pensioners , and sharing it with everyone else			0
that is no reward for a lifetime spent saving			0
hopefully , the chancellor will realise that on this occasion , simpler is not better , and reject another stealth tax hike on the prudent .			0
