getting ready : a @entity2 task force of 3,000 troops is on standby to tackle a humanitarian crisis sparked by the mounting violence in @entity6			1
@entity22 , pictured in the @entity8 , could be used if the situation deteriorates on standby : a rapid reaction flotilla is poised in the eastern @entity8 ready to assist civilians escape the appalling carnage			1
these @entity27 could be called into action officially the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) is deployed for complex naval ‘ war games ’ codenamed @entity31			2
but commanders are prepared to switch ‘ immediately ’ to an aid mission to avert a humanitarian tragedy as brutal @entity6 dictator @entity35 continues to slaughter his own people			1
nearly 40,000 have been killed and 200,000 made homeless since the tyrant began crushing a pro-democracy uprising			1
prime minister @entity39 is increasingly frustrated at the international community ’s failure to halt the sickening bloodshed			2
general sir @entity43 , @entity44 , has revealed @entity14 troops could ‘ intervene ’ as winter temperatures plunge and desperate refugees spill from the civil war into neighbouring @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
the @entity52 has warned four million @entity6 will need emergency aid - but admits parts of the war - torn nation are no - go zones for relief workers			1
preparations : @entity22 is pictured in the @entity8 as part of an exercise to test the ground attack capabilities of the new @entity29 , the @entity14 's ' @entity63 ' captain @entity64 , commander of aircraft carrier @entity22 , taking part in exercises off @entity68 , @entity69 , said the task force was ready to spring into action			1
he said : ‘ if there is an imperative to do some form of evacuation operation , the task group is ready to do that			1
that ’s exactly the sort of role we could switch to immediately			2
‘ the very idea of the @entity29 is to be at a very high level of readiness			2
if we were activated to go and do something today we would be able to provide a response			2
‘ i have the expertise of 1,000 or so sailors , @entity86 and soldiers on here that can allow me to do that pretty much at the drop of a hat			0
we have got the ability to go in and evacuate @entity14 entitled persons to safety			1
‘ @entity22 alone has got space to make us an ideal ship to look after evacuees for a short period			0
you could quite easily take 1,000 people in and take them to a place of safety			0
we have done it before , i envisage us being able to do it again			0
‘ in a matter of days the task group can be diverted towards an area where we might be required to act			0
it provides a real relevance to our training			0
next time we are doing this it could be for real			0
’ commodore @entity114 , the one - star officer commanding the whole task group , said : ‘ we are ready to respond to anything			2
’ set up in 2010 ’s @entity117 , the @entity29 is primed to deal with unexpected world events , ranging from war - fighting to humanitarian interventions and evacuations			0
it currently consists of 22,000 - tonne aircraft carrier @entity22 , assault and command ship @entity123 , type 23 frigate @entity125 and @entity127 , a support vessel packed with stores , fuel and equipment			0
@entity132 , a merchant vessel , is carrying emergency supplies			1
the fleet consists of 1,200 @entity86 , supported by specialist engineers , medics and reconnaissance , and 1,800 @entity2 and @entity140 personnel			0
more than 12 helicopters are available including @entity143 gunships from @entity144 - which fought against @entity146 - @entity145 specialising in surveillance and @entity148 transporters			0
concerns : defence chiefs are drawing up contingency plans to evacuate @entity14 citizens trapped in the chaos and provide emergency food , shelter and medical supplies to tens of thousands of refugees assistance : @entity2 commanders are prepared to switch to an aid mission to avert a humanitarian tragedy as brutal @entity6 dictator @entity35 continues to slaughter his own people the flotilla is currently focused on practising amphibious landings in ‘ enemy ’ territory			1
troops have been rehearsing the evacuation of ‘ refugees ’ from the shoreline of a conflict - torn country			2
this is significant as the coast of @entity6 is less than 1,000 miles away and could be reached by the @entity29 in three days			0
sailors pretending to be displaced citizens clustered at a naval base in a makeshift ‘ safe haven ’ waiting to be transferred to @entity22 and @entity123 by landing craft			2
but in a real emergency @entity182 and @entity145 helicopters would fly forward to pick up bedraggled @entity14 passport holders			1
@entity86 could also travel inland in protected vehicles to rescue people			0
once aboard , they would be screened for nationality , have their official documents checked and given medical care , food , sanitation and bedding			1
the @entity29 can pick up 3,000 people in a single lift and move them quickly to safety			0
training : merlin helicopters on board the @entity22 are pictured during an exercise responsibilities : the captain of @entity22 , @entity64 , is pictured one experienced naval officer told the @entity204 : ‘ this is just an exercise but it is very timely			0
we may be called upon if the situation in @entity6 continues to worsen			0
we ’re perfectly placed to go			0
’ @entity2 vessels could act as transport hubs , escorting specially chartered civilian ships to distribute aid and pick up foreign nationals fleeing @entity6 and surrounding countries			0
@entity86 deployed with weapons are also on standby to protect ports where humanitarian supplies are unloaded			2
the @entity218 and @entity219 has been closely involved in contingency plans to evacuate @entity14 passport holders			1
officials fear that thousands of @entity14 would become trapped if instability and violence spreads from @entity6			1
the operation would mirror the evacuation of @entity49 in 2006 when 3,500 @entity14 passport holders were rescued			1
ministers are wary to avoid any move becoming the first step towards full - scale military intervention against @entity35 ’s regime			1
sending troops into @entity6 would be difficult without a @entity235 resolution – so far blocked by @entity236 and @entity237			0
but deploying to neighbouring countries is an option .			0
