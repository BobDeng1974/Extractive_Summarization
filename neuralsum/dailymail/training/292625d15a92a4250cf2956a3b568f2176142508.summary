in a strongly - worded attack on interference from @entity14 , the prime minister called for the @entity15 to have its wings clipped			1
the defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the @entity4 's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights			2

in february last year the @entity42 called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 , despite repeated warnings from @entity14			0

despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the @entity42 , the @entity6 judges have continued to repeat their instructions			0
