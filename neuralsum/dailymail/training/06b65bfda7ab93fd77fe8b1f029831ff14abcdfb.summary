by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:37 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 04:43 est , 4 october 2012 viewers of @entity3 got a rather rude awakening yesterday after a foul - mouthed comment was broadcast by mistake			1
@entity8 ’s morning show took on a distinctly post-watershed air when business reporter @entity10 turned the air blue – not realising her microphone was switched on			1
during an item about musicals , host @entity13 welcomed conductor @entity16 to the studio , showing a clip of his orchestra before wishing him a ‘ good beautiful morning ’			1
the presenters carried on interviewing mr @entity16			1
but @entity13 later apologised for the ' unfortunate ' language and blamed a microphone not being turned off for the blunder			2
she said : ' now a little earlier on in the programme we realise that there was a technical error and a microphone may have been open and unfortunate language may have been broadcast in the programme			2
' if you heard that this morning we do make an apology for that			2
unfortunately people who presume that their microphone is closed may talk a little bit more freely than they should			2
' so apologies if you were offended by that and we are just going to look into correcting that technical problem and make sure that it does n’t happen again			0
' the foul - mouthed outburst became a popular talking point online as users sent messages about the slip on @entity61			0
over to you : @entity10 finished her piece and handed back over to @entity21 and @entity64 unaware : @entity13 continued to introduce her guest when the profanity was blurted out the @entity3 said a microphone had been left on outside the studio which picked up the four - letter word			1
a spokeswoman said : ' during the programme this morning , we accidentally played out not - for - broadcast audio containing an audible swear word			0
the error was caused by a radio microphone inadvertently being left on outside our studio			0
' our presenters apologised on air as soon as the mistake was identified and we are reviewing our procedures accordingly			0
' the show has previously had to apologise for broadcasting swear words when an uncensored tape of actor @entity86 letting fly with a torrent of abuse was mistakenly aired			0
dame @entity90 and film director @entity91 have also used bad language on the programme			0
apologetic : @entity64 ( right ) later apologised for the mishap on air video : hear the unfortunate on - air slip - up * * contains strong language * *			1

business reporter @entity10 said : ' what the * * * * is that ? '
