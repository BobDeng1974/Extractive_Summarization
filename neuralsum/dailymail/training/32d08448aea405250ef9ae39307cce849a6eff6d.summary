by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 21 march 2013 thirty - five years after its launch , @entity1 may have left the solar system			1
researchers say drastic changes in radiation levels measured by the probe confirm it has travelled beyond the influence of the @entity10 mission scientists today confirmed the probe is ' in a new region ' - although scientists are continuing to debate whether @entity1 has reached interstellar space or entered a separate , undefined region beyond the solar system			1
@entity18 's @entity1 probe has finally left the solar system , mission scientists have confirmed @entity18 's robotic space probes @entity1 and 2 , both weighing 1,592 lb ( 722 kg ) , prepared for launch in 1977 on missions to locate and study the outer @entity24 and eventually interstellar space			1
@entity26 launched on august 20 , 1977 , before @entity1			1
@entity1 launched on september 5 , 1977 moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it			1
on june 15 , 2012 , @entity18 scientists reported that @entity1 may be very close to entering interstellar space and becoming the first man - made object to leave the @entity24			1
@entity26 will have to be turned off by 2020 , and @entity1 will have to be turned off by 2025			1
the results confirm the probe has left the heliosphere			2
the heliosphere is a region of space dominated by the @entity10 and its wind of energetic particles , and which is thought to be enclosed , bubble - like , in the surrounding interstellar medium of gas and dust that pervades the @entity44 galaxy			1
on august 25 , 2012 , @entity18 ’s @entity1 spacecraft measured drastic changes in radiation levels , more than 11 billion miles from the @entity10 anomalous cosmic rays , which are cosmic rays trapped in the outer heliosphere , all but vanished , dropping to less than 1 percent of previous amounts			1
at the same time , galactic cosmic rays - cosmic radiation from outside of the solar system - spiked to levels not seen since @entity1 ’s launch , with intensities as much as twice previous levels			1
the findings have been accepted for publication in @entity62 , a journal of the @entity64			0
' within just a few days , the heliospheric intensity of trapped radiation decreased , and the cosmic ray intensity went up as you would expect if it exited the heliosphere , ' said @entity70 , professor emeritus of astronomy at @entity72 in @entity73			0
he calls this transition boundary the ' heliocliff			0
' in the article , the authors state : ' it appears that [ @entity1 ] has exited the main solar modulation region , revealing [ hydrogen ] and [ helium ] spectra characteristic of those to be expected in the local interstellar medium			1
' however , @entity70 said scientists are continuing to debate whether @entity1 has reached interstellar space or entered a separate , undefined region beyond the solar system			1
' it ’s outside the normal heliosphere , i would say that , ' @entity70 said			0
' we ’re in a new region			0
and everything we ’re measuring is different and exciting			0
' the ' magnetic highway ' : here the sun 's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in late last year researchers said @entity18 's long - running @entity1 spacecraft has entered a new layer of the solar system that scientists had n't known was there , researchers say			1
scientists have dubbed this region the ‘ magnetic highway ’ and say it 's the last stop before interstellar space , or the space between stars			1
' we do believe this may be the very last layer between us and interstellar space , ’ said @entity116 , voyager project scientist based at the @entity117 , in @entity118 , @entity119			1
‘ this region was not anticipated , was not predicted			0
’ therefore , it 's hard to determine how soon the spacecraft will leave the solar system altogether , @entity116 said at the time			2
‘ it may take two months , it may take two years , ’ he added			0
@entity125 : this artist 's concept shows @entity18 's two @entity1 spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our @entity10 space weather : @entity1 is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward in a release , @entity18 said it was referring to this new region as a magnetic highway for charged particles because our @entity10 's magnetic field lines are connected there to interstellar magnetic field lines			1
this connection allows lower - energy charged particles from inside our heliosphere - the bubble of charged particles the @entity10 blows around itself - to zoom out , and allows higher - energy particles from outside to stream in			2
before entering this region , the charged particles bounced around in all directions , as if trapped on local roads inside the heliosphere			0
it was data taken from @entity1 's low - energy charged particle instrument that showed it first entered the magnetic highway region in july			2
the instrument includes a stepper motor that turns the platform on which the sensors are mounted , so that the field of view rotates through 360 degrees			0
this motor was tested for 500,000 steps , enough to reach the orbit of @entity168 , and has now completed over 6 million steps			0
the old - fashioned capacitor bank underneath the motor stores energy needed to provide a 15.7 - watt pulse every 192 seconds			0
however , because the direcrtion of the magnetic field lines has remained the same , the voyager team believed the new region is still inside our solar bubble			2
they predict the direction of these magnetic field lines will change when the craft breaks out into interstellar space			2
since december 2004 , when @entity1 crossed a point in space called the termination shock , the spacecraft has been exploring the heliosphere 's outer layer , called the heliosheath			2
in this region , the stream of charged particles from the sun , known as the solar wind , abruptly slowed down from supersonic speeds and became turbulent			2
@entity1 's environment was consistent for about five and a half years			2
the spacecraft then detected that the outward speed of the solar wind slowed to nothing			0
the intensity of the magnetic field also began to increase at that time			0
data from two instruments aboard voyager that measure charged particles showed it first entered the magnetic highway region on july 28 last year			0
the region ebbed away and flowed toward @entity1 several times			2
the spacecraft entered the region again august 25 and the environment has been stable since			0
' if we were judging by the charged particle data alone , i would have thought we were outside the heliosphere , ' said @entity219 , chief scientist on the low - energy charged particle instrument			0
' but we need to look at what all the instruments are telling us and only time will tell whether our interpretations about this frontier are correct			0
' spacecraft data revealed the magnetic field became stronger each time @entity1 entered the highway region ; however , the direction of the magnetic field lines did not change			2
' we are in a magnetic region unlike any we 've been in before - about ten times more intense than before the termination shock - but the magnetic field data show no indication we 're in interstellar space , ' said @entity236 , a member of the team that looks after @entity1 's magnetometer			1
' the magnetic field data turned out to be the key to pinpointing when we crossed the termination shock			0
and we expect these data will tell us when we first reach interstellar space			2
' @entity1 and its sister probe @entity26 launched 35 years ago on a tour of the outer planets			1
@entity26 launched on august 20 , 1977 , about two weeks before @entity1			1
it is now 9billion miles from the sun. @entity1 launched on september 5 , 1977 , moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it			1
it is now more than 11 billion miles from the sun. the signal from @entity1 takes approximately 17 hours to travel to @entity252			0
after hurtling into space , both probes have continued to travel toward the fringes of the solar system			1
interstellar missions : a map of the @entity1 tours through outer space @entity168 : an image of the sixth planet taken by @entity26 @entity263 : an image of the eight planet taken by @entity26 the @entity266 are @entity18 's longest - running spacecraft , and will continue traveling after they have left the solar system			1
as soon as @entity1 breaks through to interstellar space , it will be the first man - made object to leave the solar system , @entity116 said			1
however , it would take at least 40,000 years before either probe came close to another star , @entity116 said			0
long before that both @entity266 will run out of power and transmit their findings back home before shutting off for good			0
‘ we will have enough power for all the instruments until 2020 ; at that point we will have to turn off our first instrument , ’ @entity116 said			0
@entity1 will have to be turned off by 2025 .			0

drastic changes in radiation levels measured by the probe confirm it has finally travelled beyond the influence of the @entity10
researchers still *unsure* whether @entity1 has reached interstellar space or entered a separate , undefined region beyond the solar system
