by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 11 january 2013 a pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties will not be forced to have an abortion after the @entity4 ruled she has the mental capacity to decide if she wants the baby			1
doctors applied for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy claiming the child is endangering her life			2
but the judge ruled the mother , who is 18 weeks pregnant , must still have the right to decide despite having a ' significant learning impairment '			2
the woman , who is not named for legal reasons , is described as being in the ' bottom one per cent of the @entity20 population ' in terms of cognitive ability			0
case : the mentally disabled woman should be forced to have an abortion , the @entity4 was told , but the judge today refused to allow it mr @entity27 said even if the pregnant woman did not have the capacity to care for the baby , society does			1
she suffers from sickle cell disease and had a series of strokes when she was young , which left her mentally impaired and for which her family won damages from a hospital for negligence			1
medics said she does not have the ability to make the decision herself and have described the need for an abortion as ' urgent '			2
but mr @entity27 , sitting in the @entity44 at @entity45 â€™s @entity4 , said it was ' in her best interests ' if the woman , who from the south of @entity50 , was ' to continue with the pregnancy '			1
the judge said it was very important to bear in mind that even if people with severe learning difficulties do not have the mental capacity to take part in legal proceedings , they ' may very well retain the capacity to make deeply personal decisions about how they conduct their lives '			0
these could include decisions about choice of partners , the extent of sexual activity , making permanent relationships ' and decisions about their own medical care including , as in this case , the continuation or termination of pregnancy , ' he said			1
he said courts and health officials should in the main stay out of decisions about whether people with learning disabilities can have children			0
he said : ' my instincts are that ( her limited mental function ) has nothing to do with the issue of whether a pregnancy should continue simply because once the child is born , if the mother does n't have the ability to care for a child , society has perfectly adequate processes to deal with that			1
' i 'm anxious about there being brought into capacity assessments ... the ability to care for a child in the future ' , he was quoted in @entity104 as saying			2
the judge added that people with reduced mental capacity should still be allowed to make decisions - whether they are bad or good - as the majority of the population do			0
there was a belief that the alleged father was known but it would not be right for the court to make any observations about that , he added			0
condition : the unnamed woman has sickle cell disease , where red blood become deformed ( pictured ) and can clog blood vessels causing breathing problems and even strokes the judge decided this after independent expert in psychiatry , dr @entity123 , expressed the view that she did have capacity ' to decide whether or not to continue with , or terminate , pregnancy '			1
the woman 's sickle cell disease is very serious and the baby must be terminated very soon to reduce the risk of her losing her life , doctors claimed			1
her condition means that her red blood cells develop abnormally , preventing oxygen being supplied around the body properly			0
the cells ' shape can also clog blood vessels , affecting breathing and leading to anaemia , severe respiratory problems , strokes and in some cases death			0
around 250,000 people in the @entity20 are believed to have it , and it is more prevalent among ethnic minorities			0
the case to force the abortion was argued by an @entity156 trust in southern @entity50 , in the @entity44 , sitting at the @entity4 in @entity45 today			1
until recently the @entity44 sat in secret and is charged with ruling on ' life and death ' cases where patients are deemed incapable of making a decision themselves			2
but it has also been criticised for some of the rulings it has made			0
the authorities have previously stopped a dementia patient going on the holiday of a lifetime because it was deemed too dangerous and forced another individual to use contraception .			0

mr @entity27 said if she could not care for the baby then society could
the @entity156 said that the termination was ' urgent ' as her life is in danger
the unnamed patient has sickle cell disease and has suffered several strokes
doctors claimed that she is unable to take decision herself
but @entity4 rules mother has ability to decide on ' continuation or termination of pregnancy '
