statins could protect against blindness and amputations caused by diabetes , researchers have found			1
diabetes patients taking the cholesterol - lowering drugs were up to 40 per cent less likely to develop these complications			1
experts believe the pills may have the added benefit of reducing inflammation in the eye and nerve damage in limbs – which in severe cases can lead to feet being amputated			1
statins could protect against blindness and amputations caused by diabetes , researchers found ( file picture ) around 29 per cent of patients with diabetes suffer damage to the blood vessels in the eye , leading to sight problems and one in ten develop foot ulcers			1
the complications are debilitating for patients and cost the @entity30 up to £ 14billion a year			0
@entity32 researchers looked at 62,716 patients with diabetes aged over 40 , during a three - year period			1
a quarter of them happened to be taking statins for high cholesterol , and the rest had never been prescribed the pills			0
the study , published in the @entity44 medical journal , showed that patients on statins were 40 per cent less likely to develop sight problems and 34 per cent less at risk of nerve damage			1
lower risk : diabetes patients taking the cholesterol - lowering drugs were up to 40 per cent less likely to develop these complications ( file picture ) they were 12 per cent less likely to get gangrene in the foot – as a result of an ulcer caused by nerve damage – which often leads to amputation			1
the researchers , led by professor @entity61 , chief physician in clinical biochemistry at @entity63 in @entity32 , were surprised by the findings			2
they had expected statins would make patients more likely to suffer complications , because they further raise blood sugar levels			2
other experts think an added benefit of the drugs is that they reduce inflammation in the nerves , preventing them from damage			1
in july , health watchdog @entity75 issued controversial guidelines urging @entity78 to prescribe statins to 17million patients to prevent heart disease			0
there is a growing body of research suggesting statins also protect against other illnesses including dementia and certain cancers			0
but some experts said it was far too early for doctors to consider prescribing statins to all patients with diabetes to prevent complications			2
dr @entity93 , from the @entity95 ’s cardiovascular research centre at the @entity96 , said : ‘ statins also have anti-inflammatory effects which might slow the progression of microvascular disease ( in the small blood vessels ) in the eye or kidney			0
‘ for now , however , any benefit of statins on microvascular complications remains unproven			2
’ around 2.9million @entity107 have diabetes , and 90 per cent of these have type 2 , which is mainly caused by obesity			0
the numbers have increased by 50 per cent in less than a decade			0
the @entity30 spends £ 14billion a year treating diabetes , and most of this is on complications			0
@entity116 , from the charity @entity117 , said : ‘ further research will be needed to find out if statins can actively help to reduce the risk of such complications			2
‘ the best way for people with @entity124 and type 2 diabetes to reduce their risk of complications is by taking prescribed diabetes medications and by maintaining a healthy weight through increased physical activity and eating a healthy balanced diet			0
