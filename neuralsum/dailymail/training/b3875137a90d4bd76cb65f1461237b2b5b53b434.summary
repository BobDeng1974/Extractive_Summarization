giving it his all : the president takes to the microphone with enthusiasm during his duet with a fellow guest sweet sounds : the off - key vocal performance has been met with a mixture of admiration and ridicule by the @entity38 public on may 27 , when the embargo was lifted , the country 's communications ministry confirmed the ban , but refused to elaborate on the reason why it had been imposed			1
the video has sparked national debate after an extended version was posted by well - known @entity38 exile @entity78 on his @entity81 page with political commentary			2
@entity78 , who now lives in @entity83 , compared @entity15 's performance to a scene from a @entity87 film and also pointed out that the extravagant celebration contradicts a number of nation 's laws which restrict the number of guests at a wedding and the length of celebrations			2
public opinion in @entity8 is said to have been divided between those who admire the leader for demonstrating a human side versus those offended by his extravagance in what is a predominantly @entity106 country .			0
