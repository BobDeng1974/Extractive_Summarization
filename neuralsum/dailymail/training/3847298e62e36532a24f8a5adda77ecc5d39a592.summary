he was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against a child at @entity28 earlier this week			2
judge @entity29 imposed an 18 - month suspended sentence , saying a jail term would unfairly affect his family as he would probably lose his job in a food processing factory			1
‘ i have to consider the impact on them - people who are not in any way at fault yet might suffer serious hardship from your actions , ’ he said			2
but the father of one of his victims said : ‘ he talks about the effect on the offender ’s family , but what about the effects on my family ?

the office is considering the case , and must decide whether to refer the sentencing to the @entity58 by may 22			1
trial : after considering the mitigation in the case , judge @entity29 ( left ) agreed @entity2 ( right ) should not go to prison the court heard @entity2 invited the girls on to his allotment			1

@entity83 , defending , had told the judge : ‘ @entity85 will almost certainly lead to him losing his job			0
' if he loses his liberty and they lose their house , that would have pretty devastating consequences on the family circumstances			0

assaults : @entity2 had attacked the two girls at these @entity104 allotments , claiming the victims had spiders on them the father of the eight - year - old added : ‘ i find it all very disgusting			1
the judge has been too lenient			0

the girls then told what had happened after breaking down in tears when preparing a salad using vegetables from @entity2 ’s allotment			2
the father continued : ‘ i feel totally let down			0
the judge lives in cloud cuckoo land			0
‘ it has caused arguments between me and my wife – it happened on my watch			0
it has caused a lot of anguish and grief			0
’ harrowing : the two child victims gave evidence at @entity28 ( pictured ) during a three - day trial he added : ‘ i told my daughter that she would n’t have to see that man ever again and it is all over and done with and now he is going to be walking around – how do you explain that to an eight - year - old ? it will just confuse her			1
‘ we have put her through this – and ourselves – and for what ? if i had known the outcome i would not have bothered			0
’ talking about how it has affected his daughter , the father said : ‘ there are noticeable little differences			0
she wo n’t stay upstairs in bed any more if her mum gets up and she carries her teddy everywhere as a comfort toy			0
