they met in the departure lounge - then went around the world together			2
it was a trip - of - a - lifetime that sparked global attention after @entity6 , 28 , offered to take any @entity8 girl called @entity9 on his @entity11 vacation			1
he booked the trip with his ex-girlfriend - @entity9 - and was determined not to waste her non-transferable ticket when they broke up			1
now , after three weeks and eight countries , he and @entity17 , 23 , have returned			2
but no , they say , there was no romance			0
' we 're like siblings ! ' : @entity6 , 28 , ( right ) took @entity24 , 23 , ( left ) around the world with his ex-girlfriend 's non-transferable ticket			1
the pair , pictured in @entity29 , said the trip lived up to their expectations merry @entity11 ! @entity6 and @entity9 said their @entity11 in @entity34 , @entity35 ( pictured ) , was magical ' it sort of brought out this brother - sister dynamic between us , ' mr @entity6 told @entity39			1
ms @entity9 , a part - time office administrator and student who already has a long - term boyfriend , told local media : ' we probably got along better because we were strangers			1
we did n't have a relationship to break			0
' the pair set off on december 21 from @entity45 and returned on january 8 , visiting @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity34 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52			1
@entity11 in @entity34 was a relaxed affair - which they largely spent apart			1
ms @entity9 , from @entity54 , spoke to her boyfriend , whose identity has remained undisclosed , between taking a bus tour of the @entity35 city			1
mr @entity6 spent the day working on his new charity project : a ticket forward , giving vacations to survivors of disease , war and abuse			2
@entity46 ! their first stop was in @entity46 , where they got a drink to get to know each other @entity71 soiree @entity72 ! they kicked off their @entity75 tour with a pit - stop in @entity72 where they took this photo last hurrah : their final stop was in @entity52 ( pictured ) where they spent the day in @entity82 to celebrate @entity6 posted this adventurous picture on @entity84 in their final week with the caption : ' throwback to awkwardly holding a @entity88 yesterday in a seafood market in # @entity52 ... while filming			1
# itwasnthappy ' but they later joined other tourists and expats for a @entity11 fun fair and agreed it was the best day of the trip			1
after getting over the initial awkwardness of meeting at the airport , they soon got to know each other , and their traveling tastes			0
' @entity100 liked to see the [ landmarks ] of different areas , and i liked to mingle where the locals hang out , ' mr @entity6 told the @entity106			2
' i hate heights and everywhere we went , she took me to the highest thing possible - whether it was the highest level of the @entity112 , or the highest bar in @entity29 - and she 'd poke fun of me for my fear of heights			1
' meanwhile @entity100 's sense of direction was a constant source of amusement for both of them			0
mr @entity6 said : ' i would get these tweets and emails from the strangest places on a quasi-frequent level of her being trapped in a stairway at the hotel or being lost in an airport or missing a train			2
' and that sort of characterized our relationship , and is a lot of where the big brother little sister thing came out			0
' ms @entity9 has no regrets			2
' it was wild , ' she told @entity141			0
' and it 's just because of my name ... i have to thank my mother for that			0
' travel companions : @entity6 ( left ) started an online campaign last month to find someone with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to travel with him on a round - the - world @entity11 vacation , since he could n't transfer the tickets			1
@entity54 student @entity154 , 23 ( right ) , agreed to join the stranger on the trip just friends : however , the trip was completely platonic since @entity9 already has a boyfriend , who is apparently not so pleased to see her leave on a vacation with another man			1
pictured above with a man who appears to be her boyfriend on @entity164 pick me , pick me ! @entity9 tweeted this picture of her @entity8 passport when she heard @entity6 was looking for someone to join him on his epic vacation from @entity46 to @entity50 ' he understands that i 've always wanted to travel so while he 's not happy i 'm taking off for nearly a month at @entity11 with a random guy he 's smiling through it , ' @entity9 said of her boyfriend , who she plans to purchase a home with			1
@entity9 says she initially thought the trip was ' crazy ' but was put at ease after spending hours talking to @entity6 over the phone			1
' it definitely did seem a little bit creepy at the beginning but now that i talked to him it 's less creepy and more awesome , ' she said			0
the original @entity9 : @entity6 ( left ) originally planned to spend this @entity11 holiday travelling around the world with former girlfriend @entity9 ( left )			1
she broke up with him after they bought all of the plane tickets because @entity6 stopped planning the trip when he broke up with his girlfriend , he did n't book any hotels for the trip			1
however , after the story went viral online , @entity189 stepped up to provide @entity6 and his companion with separate rooms at each stop on their journey			2
of the thousands of emails he received in his search , he got one especially touching message from an 8 - year - old boy who was going blind and wanted to see the world before losing his vision			1
that message inspired @entity6 , who works in international real estate , to start an organization with his brother called @entity206 to help people who want to travel but do n't have the money			2
@entity6 initially started his search on @entity209 last month , posting a plea that said : ' i need your help			1
you see , in march i booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this @entity11 for my ex and i. desperate : in november , @entity6 posted this message to @entity209 in an attempt to find another @entity9 willing to join him on the trip ' while our relationship has come to a close , i am still planning on going on the trip and she is not ( naturally )			1
' and because i hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste , i am looking for a @entity8 named @entity9 who could use the ticket			2
' anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible			0
' moreover , the flights were purchased during a massive blow - up on @entity236 and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they 're not worth the headache or money to cancel			2
' before potential candidates started applying to accompany him , he laid some ground rules , but also offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off			0
giving : the campaign opened up @entity247 to how lucky he was to be taking such a vacation , and he has since launched a charity to help other people travel who ca n't afford it he wrote : ' i am not looking for anything in return			0
i am not looking for companionship , romance , drugs , a trade , or to take selfies with you in front the @entity263 in @entity49			2
' if you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks , great			0
really the only thing i ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness			0
' we can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not			0
i 'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing ( see ya on the plane ! )			0
' embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing , though , so if you want to travel together ( and are not an axe murder ) i 'm likely game			0
' this is for the flights only			0
in the wake of the breakup i have deferred all further planning for the trip			0
no hotels , trains or anything have been booked			0
you 're on your own , bucko			0
having said that , i will buy the first round of vino at @entity293 upon departure			0

@entity6 booked once - in - a - lifetime @entity11 trip with girlfriend @entity9 last year , but they broke up
the 28 - year - old @entity45 *resident* started an online campaign last month to find someone also called @entity9 to take tickets in her name
a 23 - year - old student named @entity154 agreed and jetted off with @entity6 on december 21 , 2014
however , she says the trip was *strictly* platonic since she already has a boyfriend
