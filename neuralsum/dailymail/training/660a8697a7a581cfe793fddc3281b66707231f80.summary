a teenager who could n't drink a glass of water without being sick was found to have a massive hair ball blocking her digestive system			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , had spent years picking up hair from the carpet and eating it			1
she also chewed the tips of her hair			2
when she finally sought medical help , doctors pulled out a hairball weighing almost 9lb ( 4kg )			2
they say without emergency surgery , the 18 - year - old , who was badly dehydrated and malnourished , would almost certainly have died			1
she also chewed the tips of her hair , which contributed to the hairball weighing 9lb ( 4kg ) , pictured on screen above they add that despite searching through 50 years of medical records , they could find no evidence of such a large hairball			1
miss @entity5 had been brought to the hospital , in the town of @entity31 , by her parents after complaining of severe stomach pains			0
after x-raying her , doctors realised there was a blockage and referred her to @entity37 in country 's capital for surgery			2
the hospital 's senior professor of surgery , @entity41 , said : ' the parents brought her in after she started losing weight , and she could n't eat anything			1
' by the time we got her , she could n't even drink water			0
we realised we needed to operate immediately			0
' it was actually the only alternative , nothing else would solve the problem			0
' in fact , her stomach was so badly swollen from hair and bits of wool from the carpet that it literally just oozed out soon as the wall of the stomach was cut			0
' he added : ' psychologically , apart from a habit of picking up hair from the carpet and eating it , the young girl was perfectly normal and healthy			0
' she also chewed the tips of her hair			0
' miss @entity5 , who is now recovering from surgery and will return home shortly , has now promised never to chew her hair in the future			2
the surgeons who operated on the 18 - year - old say they can find no evidence of such a large hairball in the last 50 years of medical literature			1

@entity5 , had spent years eating hair picked up from the carpet
18 - year - old , @entity6 , also chewed the tips of her hair , say doctors
