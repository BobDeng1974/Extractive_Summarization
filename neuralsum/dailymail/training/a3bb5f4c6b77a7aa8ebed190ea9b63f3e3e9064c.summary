dazzlingly colourful and irresistibly fluffy , faux fur is taking over the @entity1			1
from @entity3 to @entity4 , retailers are selling a wide range of stoles , hats , coats and bedspreads this winter			0
and shoppers are snapping them up after seeing celebrities such as @entity12 and @entity13 swathed in the fabric			2
but far from concealing the fact the fur is n’t real , they ’re flaunting it as a way of proving their ethical credentials			1
no wonder : fur has been demonised to such an extent by animal - rights campaigners that wearing the real thing is likely to earn you a few severe looks at best , and public rants by strangers at worst			1
both @entity30 ( pictured ) and her sister @entity31 have been seen in real fur in recent years however , the fur industry is now fighting back with a devastating — and intriguing — suggestion that faux fur is actually far less ethical than real fur			1
and the campaign is working : sales of real fur are booming again			1
to understand the contentious issue , we have to go back to 1994 , when five supermodels took off their clothes , sat on the floor and told the world : ‘ we ’d rather go naked than wear fur			1
’ the campaign , by animal - rights charity @entity45 , was a triumph			2
sales of mink , sable and chinchilla plummeted			0
since then , all but one of the five models ( @entity55 ) has failed to keep their word : @entity58 , for example , posed in a £ 120,000 @entity60 sable coat in 2009 , and @entity61 promoted mink coats in 2004			2
celebrities such as @entity64 , both @entity30 sisters , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 have worn fur in recent years			1
and real - fur sales have increased globally by 58 per cent since the end of the @entity72 , says the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			2
there have been no fur farms in the @entity76 since 2003 due to the @entity77 ( @entity78 ) act indeed , almost 500 designers , including @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , currently use fur in their collections			2
and some furriers claim almost three - quarters of this year ’s catwalk shows feature fur			2
tv stylist @entity89 says : ‘ without question , it ’s becoming more fashionable			0
i ’ve never seen so much fur on the @entity1			1
faux or real , it ’s on almost every item going , from dresses to tops and even keyrings			2
’ so , what on @entity100 has happened to change our minds on fur so radically ? the battle between the anti and pro-fur lobbies is still being fought vehemently			2
but @entity106 , chief executive of @entity73 , thinks that the new generation of fashionistas is waking up to the environmental impact of faux - fur production — and deciding that climate change is their main concern			1
‘ younger people in particular want to hear all the facts then make up their own minds , ’ he says			0
‘ the argument that we should replace real fur with fake is completely wrong			1
for environmental reasons , it should be the other way around			2
faux fur is taking over the @entity1 after shoppers have seen celebrities wearing it ‘ there is n’t any doubt that the environmental impact of fake fur is profoundly worse than fur - farming			1
’ it ’s undeniable that fake fur is made from non-renewable petroleum - based products , such as nylon , acrylic and polyester , then treated with heat and chemicals to improve its look and feel			2
these industrial processes use three times as much non-renewable energy as real fur , according to the @entity144			1
@entity64 has also been seen in real fur			1
real - fur sales have increased globally by 58 per cent since the end of the @entity72 , says the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) but fashion - conscious consumers often dump their faux - fur garments after just one season			1
many end up in landfill and , just like petroleum - based plastic bags , can take up to 1,000 years to decompose			0
real fur , meanwhile , biodegrades naturally within six months to a year , and can even be composted in the garden , says @entity106			1
washing fake fur may harm the environment , too			2
with every machine wash , says a 2011 paper for the @entity159 journal , each garment releases an average of 1,900 tiny particles of plastic , which are then swilled into rivers , lakes and , eventually , the sea			0
@entity61 promoted mink coats in 2004 despite having featured in @entity45 's anti-fur campaign it ’s feared these particles may kill marine life and disrupt food chains			1
pro-fur lobbies also point to the unethical working practices of some faux - fur manufacturers			2
it ’s already widely known that disposable fashion often relies on @entity179 sweatshop labour , paltry wages and toxic working conditions			0
but the @entity144 claims that the manufacture of fake fur doubles the risk of ill - health in workers due to the emissions of carcinogenic substances during production			0
and @entity191 spokesman @entity190 says : ‘ fast fashion is promoting dependence on foreign oil and exacerbating child - labour issues in the @entity179			0
’ given all this , should we not be buying the real deal instead ? costume designer @entity199 , who has worked for @entity200 and @entity201 and is a life - long vegetarian , says it ’s a grey area			0
‘ i ’m not pro-fur but , because i ’ve been educated on the subject , i ’m not against it either , ’ she says			0
in 1994 , five supermodels took off their clothes , sat on the floor and told the world : ‘ we ’d rather go naked than wear fur ’ , including @entity58 who has since worn it in public ‘ killing animals for vanity is not right , but there are whole communities of people who rely on this industry for employment , and , in the majority of cases , the animals are treated well , so that they ’ll have healthy coats			0
‘ animals are treated horrifyingly in the meat industry , and nobody is throwing cans of red paint at steak - eaters			0
’ around 20 per cent of fur comes not from farms , but trapping wild animals			0
these creatures , claim the pro-fur campaigners , are often killed quickly and humanely			0
some are culled to help balance animal populations and native ecosystems			0
for example , the government has encouraged people to buy what they call ‘ the world ’s most ecological fur ’ — that of the paihamu , a small , non-native , furry animal that has been wreaking havoc on native species			0
@entity13 has also been credited with the rise in popularity of faux fur meanwhile , fur - friendly companies , such as the @entity254 , insist that all their furs are vegetable - dyed and tanned via traditional , non-toxic methods			1
however , this comes at a price — a mink scarf from @entity254 costs £ 1,500			0
the @entity73 advises consumers to buy only garments marked with the ‘ @entity270 ’ label , a scheme launched in 2007 to ensure that fur ‘ comes from a country where welfare regulations or standards governing fur production are in force ’			0
@entity106 is adamant that almost two - thirds of fur traded internationally is from @entity270 countries			0
yet none of this will convince @entity45 ’s @entity76 director @entity276 that real fur is anything other than abhorrent			1
she maintains that the pro-lobby have got it wrong on the environmental impact of faux fur , and says there are plenty of eco-friendly faux options available			1
she also claims that a cocktail of carcinogens , such as ammonia , chromium and formaldehyde , which is often used in dressing and dyeing real fur , negates its biodegradability			1
‘ fur is only “ natural ” when it ’s on the animal who was born with it , ’ says @entity276			0
‘ recent independent studies have found that the impact of production of a mink coat on climate change is three to ten times higher than the impact of a faux - fur coat			1
‘ we all have the choice to be cruel or kind			0
so , when real fur involves electrocuting a fox , or slitting the throat of a rabbit for fur trim , choosing one of the many soft , warm and luxurious faux or fur - free options , which are also more eco-friendly , becomes a no - brainer			1
’ meanwhile , @entity199 says : ‘ if someone was to be truly to - the - letter ethical , they ought to forego both real and faux fur — and also fast fashion in general			1
’ no wonder the great fur debate remains as heated as ever			0
but , as the weather gets chillier and we reach for our @entity321 hat and warming stole , it seems there ’s no easy answer .			0

both @entity30 and sister @entity31 have been seen in real fur
models in an anti-fur campaign have gone back on their promise
faux fur is taking over the @entity1
shoppers have been *inspired* by the celebrity trend
but what is its environmental impact ?
