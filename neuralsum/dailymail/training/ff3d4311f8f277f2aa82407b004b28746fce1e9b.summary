@entity0 scored his second century of the match as @entity2 set the platform for a final - day push for victory in the first test against @entity7 in @entity8			1
the in - form opener added 102 to his first - innings 145 , the second time in 2014 that he has scored two tons in a @entity6 , having notched 135 and 145 against @entity10 in march			1
the left - hander now has 1,061 runs in seven tests this year , with six centuries and three half - centuries			2
@entity0 celebrates as he reaches his second century on day four of the first test in @entity8 @entity18 opener @entity0 jumps in the air after hitting a century against @entity7 at the @entity20 batsman @entity0 hits a shot on his way to another 100 for the hosts in the first test on friday @entity0 ( right ) celebrates his century with @entity18 team - mate @entity26 with the late @entity28 ' test cap number 408 displayed on the pitch @entity0 was not without some fortune on a niggly fourth day at the @entity20 , though , as he was given out when on 63 only to be brought back as bowler @entity31 had over-stepped , an incident which saw tempers flare between the sides			1
the @entity2 opener also gloved a ball to the wicket - keeper down the leg - side but was given not out , while he was also dropped at gully by @entity39 on 89			0
@entity0 was finally dismissed in the final session , bowled round his legs attempting a reverse sweep at @entity43 , but @entity2 went on the offensive in the closing stages			2
some late hitting from @entity26 ( 52 not out ) and @entity47 ( 40 off 26 balls ) helped @entity2 close the fourth day on 290 for five with a lead of 363 , which leaves @entity7 facing a likely battle to avoid defeat on day five			1
the tourists were earlier bowled out for 444 having resumed on 369 for five , with @entity53 finishing with five for 134			0
the off - spinner was looking just as dangerous as he was the evening before and he snared @entity56 caught and bowled for 43			0
@entity0 is bowled off a no - ball by @entity7 's @entity31 who celebrates before the wicket was chalked off @entity0 ( right ) gestures towards @entity7 's @entity59 after he was recalled to the crease @entity61 has words with the @entity64 players in the aftermath of the no - ball @entity7 captain @entity67 ( right ) does his best to diffuse the situation between @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity31 @entity70 also claimed the wickets of @entity72 and @entity73 while @entity74 sent back @entity43 and @entity75 - who led a late counter-attack with a quickfire 34 - as @entity7 were bowled out before lunch			1
that left @entity2 with a lead of 73 and they quickly set about adding to that advantage , making lunch on 32 without loss			0
the hosts lost @entity86 softly soon after the resumption , the opener sweeping @entity43 to @entity56 at midwicket for 21 , but his fellow left - hander @entity0 was motoring along at the other end			2
the batsman took a moment to applaud when news came through of @entity96 's figures of six for 14 for @entity97 in his first match since bowling the ball which killed @entity28 , and @entity0 also took another moment to remember his former team - mate when he reached 63			0
@entity2 captain @entity102 walks from the field after being dismissed on day four a tribute to @entity28 with the number 63 can be seen from inside the scoreboard at the @entity20 soon after @entity0 was trudging off , thinking he had been clean bowled by @entity31 as he attempted a huge sweep			2
but @entity31 had over-stepped his mark , and when @entity0 returned he mocked @entity31 's celebrations as he echoed his screams of " come on ! " back at the bowler			0
that raised the temperature out in the middle and angry words were exchanged between the players more than once with the umpires forced to intervene - something that was repeated again later in the day			0
it did not rattle @entity2 however , and although @entity61 ( 33 ) and captain @entity102 ( seven ) came and went , @entity0 - while riding his luck - brought up his 11th @entity6 and with the help of some late fireworks from @entity47 , which included 24 off a @entity43 over , put hosts in a strong position to push for victory .			1
