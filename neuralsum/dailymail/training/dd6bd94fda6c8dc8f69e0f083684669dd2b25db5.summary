@entity8 was pulled over by @entity10 's @entity9 and given a ticket for driving with one hand while holding the phone in the other to peer at directions on its map software			1
he appealed against the ticket , but the punishment was upheld by judges at a @entity10 appellate court			2
distraction : a man given a ticket for holding his mobile phone in one hand to use its map function while driving in @entity10 has had his punishment upheld on appeal			2
( @entity30 image ) judges ruled that using the gps or map function on a mobile phone while driving is a moving violation on the same level as sending a text message while driving			2
@entity8 was cited for ' moving violation section 23123 , subdivision ( a ) , driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless phone ' , on january 5 by @entity44 officer @entity43 , according to court documents			1
at his appeal , heard on april 26 , both @entity8 and officer @entity43 testified that he was indeed looking at a map on a phone held in his hand while driving			1
the underlying facts of the case were undisputed , but @entity8 argued that the wording of the statute was not intended to cover using a wireless phone to look at a map			1
he maintained lawmakers had intended to limit the application to ' conversing ' or ' listening and talking ' on a mobile			0
the @entity10 v. @entity8 ruling reads : ' this case requires us to determine whether using a wireless phone solely for its map application function while driving violates @entity67 section 23123			1
' we hold that it does			0
' ' the judgment of conviction is affirmed ' : the text of the ruling handed down by the @entity73 of @entity74 which upheld the punishment of @entity8 applying the test of plain language to the letter of the law , the court concluded that ' the primary evil sought to be avoided is the distraction the driver faces when using his or her hands to operate the phone			1
' that distraction would be present whether the wireless telephone was being used as a telephone , a gps navigator , a clock or a device for sending and receiving text messages and emails			0
' the ruling added : ' this statute ... is specifically designed to prevent a driver from using a wireless telephone while driving unless the device is being used in a hands free manner			0
' the plain language of the statute and its legislative history support that conclusion			0

@entity8 appealed against the citation by @entity44
he *claimed* the law was only intended to apply to phone conversations
judges disagree , ruling that the device is still a ' distraction '
