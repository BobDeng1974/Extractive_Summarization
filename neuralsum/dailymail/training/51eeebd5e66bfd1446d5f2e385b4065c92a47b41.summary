president @entity0 finally broke his silence this morning on the problems plaguing his administration 's @entity3			1
the president said he ' will not stand ' for allegations of misconduct			2
' not as commander in chief , but also not as an @entity9			0
none of us should , ' he said			0
@entity0 called va secretary @entity12 ' a great public servant and a great warrior on behalf of the @entity9			1
' ' we 're gon na work with him to solve the problem , ' @entity0 said , confirming that he had not asked @entity12 for his resignation			1
however the president said he would wait to see the results of the @entity3 's internal report before making any decisions about the future of the beleaguered agency			2
as commander in chief , ' the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity42 is overseeing an internal review of the @entity3 's operations in light of allegations that 40 veterans died after staff at a @entity3 facility in @entity52 , @entity44 put them on secret waiting lists to cover up how long it was taking them to receive care			1
the president said he expects to see a preliminary report from @entity42 on the secret waiting lists next week and full report next month on ' how the @entity3 can up their game			1
' before @entity0 's 10 am meeting with @entity12 even began , the @entity43 announced that the president would make a statement at 10.45 am directly after , leading observers to believe the president may be asking for @entity12 's resignation during their meeting			1
the @entity43 had already forced under secretary of health for the @entity3 , @entity71 , to abruptly resign last friday after his lackluster performance a day before at a @entity74 hearing			1
@entity71 was already set to retire this year , but the @entity43 forced him out early , sensing that someone 's head needed to roll over the alleged misconduct at @entity3 hospitals			1
even as @entity71 's employment with the @entity3 was terminated early , the @entity43 stood by @entity12 , who has repeatedly said he 's not going to step down			1
' the president supports secretary @entity12 ’s decision , ' @entity43 press secretary @entity80 said on friday			1
@entity0 reiterated that support during his press conference today , fondly referring to @entity12 by his nickname , ' @entity86 , ' throughout his remarks			2
' across the board , he has put his heart and soul into this thing , and he has taken it very seriously , ' @entity0 said			0
secretary @entity12 serves the country because ' he cares very deeply about veterans , and he cares deeply about the mission , ' @entity0 said			1
unhappy warriors : @entity97 members have camped out in congressional hearing rooms as @entity3 officials field questions about extended wait - times and secret waiting lists for medical care at @entity3 hospitals and clinics ' and i know that @entity86 , his attitude is , if he does not think he can do a good job on this , and if he thinks he 's let our veterans down , then i am sure that he is not gon na be interested in committing to serve , ' he continued			1
' at this stage , @entity86 is committed to solving the problem , and working with us to do it			0
' safe , for now : @entity9 veterans affairs secretary , retired general @entity12 , met with @entity0 wednesday morning to outline how the @entity3 will fix its now legendary shortcomngs the president said during his prepared remarks that he has been inspired by wounded veterans ' ' spirit and their determination to recover and often to serve			1
' ' these men and women are the best that our country has to offer , ' @entity0 said			0
' so when i hear allegations of misconduct - any misconduct , ' he said , ' whether it 's allegations of @entity3 staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books , i will not stand for it			1
not as commander in chief , but also not as an @entity9			0
' so , if these allegations prove to be true , it is dishonorable			0
it is disgraceful , and i will not tolerate it period			0
' ' once we know the facts , i assure you , if there is misconduct , it will be punished , ' @entity0 said			2
senate minority leader @entity151 immediately criticized the president for not taking a heavier hand			0
' a crisis of the magnitude facing the @entity3 on providing care to our veterans demands clear leadership from president @entity0 , ' @entity154 said			1
' unfortunately , so far i have yet to hear from the president that he is treating the @entity3 crisis with the seriousness it deserves			2
' @entity166 chairman @entity165 raised similar questions about the president 's decision not to act yet given recent reports that his team has known for five years that @entity3 hospitals were falsifying records to make it look like veterans were waiting for care for shorter periods of time than they actually were			2
' why did president @entity0 wait to address this situation only to ask our veterans for more time and to offer nothing but words ? ' @entity179 said in a statement			1
' we 've known about these problems for weeks — facilities cooking their books , veterans dying while waiting for an appointment and bonuses being handed out to those in charge			0
the @entity194 , we now know , has known about them even longer			0
' anyone who is found to be guilty of the allegations will be held accountable , @entity0 promised during his remarks , and called on both @entity199 and @entity200 to work together and not let the scandal ' become another political football			2
' out : @entity203 dr. @entity71 resigned suddenly on friday , just a day after defending his record in a @entity206 hearing ' if somebody ’s engaged in mismanagement or misconduct , not only do i not want them getting bonus , i want them punished , ' @entity0 said			2
he pointed out that the individuals involved in creating the secret wait lists at the @entity216 at the center of the scandal have already been put on administrative leave			0
' i know that people are angry and want swift reckoning			0
but we have to let the investigators do they 're job and get to the bottom of what happened , ' the president added			0
@entity0 said several times today that does n't want to ' get ahead ' of the internal review or any other investigations such as the report the va inspector general is working on			1
the somewhat slow pace of the investigation into the secret wait list ' is not as a consequence people not caring about the problem , ' it 's that 85 million appointments are made through @entity3 hospitals a year			0
' that 's a lot of appointments , ' the president said			0
the president said under his leadership , the @entity3 made benefits available to two million veterans who did not have them before and expanded access to care for veterans with mental health issues and women veterans , all of which are positive developments , but also created stress on veterans health systems and contributed to wait times			2
based on the results of the investigation so far , the long appointment wait times were for ' folks who may have had chronic conditions , ' and ' it was not necessarily a situation where they were calling for emergency services , ' the president said			0
furthermore , ' there are parts of the @entity3 health care system that have performed well , ' @entity0 said , and the satisfaction rate of many veterans has been ' high			1
' the president admitted he did not know whether the secret wait lists were ' systemic ' or if the @entity52 scandal was ' just an episodic problem			0
' ' there are going to be a lot of questions that we have to answer , ' he concluded .			0

president @entity0 finally broke his silence on allegations that a @entity216 lied about how *quickly* it was providing veterans with care
the president said he ' will not stand ' for allegations of misconduct , but currently they are just that - allegations
@entity0 said he would n't take further action until deputy chief of staff to the @entity43 @entity42 *completes* his internal review of the va
regarding , va secretary @entity12 , @entity0 said , ' we 're gon na work with him to solve the problem '
but he left the door open to fire @entity12 if it turns out the @entity3 scandal was worse than he first thought
