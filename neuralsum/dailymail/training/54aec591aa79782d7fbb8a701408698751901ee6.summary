by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 11:45 est , 4 march 2014 the peregrine falcon is the fastest member of the animal kingdom and is renowned for its speedy hunting swoop , which it uses to catch prey			0
while the birds are much admired , exactly how they achieve speeds of 200mph and precision when diving has remained a mystery			2
but now a team of @entity16 scientists have studied the falcons using a series of cameras to investigate the birds ’ aerodynamics , and have discovered that their feathers ' pop up ' to reduce drag			1
they snapped the birds during different points of their dives down the side of a 200ft dam ( pictured ) the peregrine falcon - or duck hawk - is renowned for its speed , reaching more than 200mph ( 322kph ) during its hunting swoop			1
it is the fastest member of the animal kingdom			0
the fastest swoop ever measured was 242mph ( 389kh ) according to @entity47			0
the bird can be found everywhere on the planet except for extreme polar regions , very high mountains and tropical rainforests , making it the world 's most widespread raptor			2
peregrine falcons eat medium - sized birds which they usually catch in flight			2
they typically measure between 12.5in ( 34cm ) to 22in ( 58cm ) in length , with females being up to a third larger than males			0
the birds catch prey by diving from a height at blistering speeds of up to 200mph ( 322kph ) , making it hard for scientists to see exactly what is going on			2
to solve this , researchers from the @entity70 and the universities of @entity72 and @entity73 , trained a small number of falcons to dive from the top of a dam to the bottom to retrieve a treat			2
they did this so they could follow the birds ' flight over a predictable path , making it easy to map , according to the study published in the @entity89 journal			2
high speed cameras focused on different parts of the dam wall - which measured 200ft ( 60metres ) tall - filmed the birds from different angles and the scientists used the footage to work out the bird ’s diving trajectory			1
by analysing the data and videos of the birds in flight , the scientists discovered that small feathers ( circled ) pop up between the birds ' wings to boost its aerodynamics at its top speed during the dives and keep air flowing smoothly over its body			1
the picture on the left is an image of oil paint showing wind flow lines on a plastic bird model this is almost impossible as there are no markers or reference points when filming the birds in the wild			0
armed with data , the researchers created a @entity129 plastic model of a peregrine falcon as if it was diving at full speed and analysed it in a wind tunnel			1
they looked at the flow of air over the model 's surface by applying a thin layer of oil paint to the model and examining the streaking patterns left behind , which gave them an idea of wind flow lines			0
peregrine falcons ( pictured ) are the fastest animals in the world			0
they were once endangered in the @entity149 but the population has made a comeback after the ban of @entity153 and other pesticides in the 1970s they also tracked the movement of tiny particles illuminated with a laser in the wind tunnel , to see how they travelled over the surface of the bird , according to @entity163			1
by analysing the data and videos of the birds in flight , the scientists discovered that small feathers pop up between the birds ’ wings on its back to boost its aerodynamics at its top speed during the dives and keep air flowing smoothly over its body			1
the pop - up feathers reduce drag and can be linkened to the flaps on an aeroplane ’s wing , or even an aerofoil on a sports car			1
the researchers found that the typical shape of the birds ' bodies and wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a v - shape			1
they used this shape to make a 3d model ( pictured bottom ) to analyse in a wind tunnel ‘ high - resolution pictures of the diving peregrine indicate that feathers pop - up in the equivalent regions , where flow separation in the model falcon occurred , ’ the scientists wrote in their paper			1
they also found that the typical shape of the birds ’ bodies and their wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a v - shape			1
‘ the leading edge of the wing is not straight but has a wavy structure with grooves in the gaps between the neck and both shoulders , ’ according to the study			0
peregrine falcons were once endangered in the @entity149 but the population has made a comeback after the ban of @entity153 and other pesticides in the 1970s			0
this is the @entity129 flight path of the falcon , which is color - coded to show how fast it travels during different parts of its dive			0
red colours denote the fastest part of its dive , with deep blue being the slowest			0
the bird had a maximum velocity of 22.5metres per second			0

a study led by @entity70 , @entity16 , used a series of cameras to map falcon 's aerodynamic dives
researchers found the typical shape of the birds ’ bodies and their wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a v - shape
wind tunnel experiments revealed that the birds also have feathers on their backs that ' pop up ' to reduce drag in 200mph dives
