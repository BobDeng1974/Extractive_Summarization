at first glance , this photo appears to show a parrot perching on a tree - sporting a curved beak , colourful feathers and a pointed tail			2
but , in fact , it is a woman whose entire body has been cleverly painted to resemble the tropical bird			1
the spectacular work of art was created by @entity13 , a former world champion body painter			0
he took four hours to paint the woman 's body using special breathable paint - adding intricate detail , dark shading and even a bright green eye			1
he then spent a further hour positioning her on a tree trump , before taking a series of photographs			0
the finished creation sees the model 's outstretched left leg become the parrot 's tail feathers , while her right leg and arm become its wings amazing : the spectacular work of art was created by 35 - year - old @entity13 , a former world champion body painter			1
he spent weeks painstakingly planning how he could transform the female model into a parrot concentration : he painted the woman 's body using special breathable paint - adding intricate detail and colours and her left arm - wrapped around her head - forms the tropical bird 's head			1
mr @entity13 , who was crowned @entity54 in 2012 , said he had chosen to position the model on a tree stump to enhance the ' parrot 's ' life - like appearance			2
' getting the scene set up took about five hours , then it took about another four hours to paint the model and an hour to get her position right , ' he said			0
incredible : the finished creation sees the model 's outstretched left leg become the parrot 's tail feathers , while her right leg and arm become its wings			1
her left arm - wrapped around her head - forms the tropical bird 's head ' it was quite hard to take the photo , to tell the model how to pose to make the parrot seem as real as possible and also to find the right point of view for me to take the photo			1
' it was not easy for the model to hold the position either			0
the whole process took about four weeks from start to finish			0
' he added : ' i feel very happy with the final work			0
most people ’s reaction are “ nice photo of a parrot , where did you photograph it ? ” makeover : mr @entity13 said even his closest friends often mistake his creation for a photo of a real - life parrot ' even some of my closest friends who know me and my art did n’t notice that it is not a real parrot			1
' when they found out , they were really amazed , stunned and surprised			0
' it is not the first time the artist has created a stunning piece of artwork using a person 's body			0
last year , he used five people to produce a life - like tree frog - painting their bodies and limbs to resemble the animal 's body , legs , arms and head .			2
