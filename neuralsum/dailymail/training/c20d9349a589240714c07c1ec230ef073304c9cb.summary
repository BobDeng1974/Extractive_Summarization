the battle to nail down a starting place for @entity4 's @entity3 opener against @entity5 on june 14 starts tonight			1
with @entity8 visiting @entity9 in the first of three warm - up matches ahead of the big kick - off in @entity13 , manager @entity7 will be looking for early clues as to the best balance of his side			1
nailed on : @entity17 ( centre ) and @entity19 ( right ) are guaranteed to start for @entity4 at the @entity3 @entity7 can lay down the foundations of his team : @entity22 in goal with and a back - four which virtually picks itself - @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity26 and @entity27 - screened by @entity28			1
the captain can either anchor a midfield trio , with energetic runners covering the ground on either side , or operate in tandem with one other deep - lying midfielder , most likely @entity35 or @entity36			0
both are expected to be given chances to stake their claims tonight			0
captain fantastic : @entity28 ( centre ) will lead @entity4 in the @entity3 in @entity13 forward from this point lie the options for @entity7 to tinker with the balance , depending on the style of opponents , conditions and @entity7 ’s tactical fancies			1
extra pace on the break ? use @entity51 ? more defensive protection and industry ? send for @entity54 ? @entity56 ’s 30 - minute cameo as a substitute against @entity58 confirmed his place in the squad , but has he done enough to force his way into the team against @entity5 ? @entity56 looks made for international football , with the vision and invention to see patterns and find passes			1
if anything , he looks even better with better players around him and he is versatile			2
he , more than most , will give @entity7 the scope to flex his formation without making substitutions			2
he can pick @entity56 wide in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 shape or tuck him inside and play 4 - 3 - 3 for a period if the game requires			2
what is certain though , is that @entity56 will need a strong performance against unfancied @entity8 if he is to earn his place in the side			2
option : @entity56 ( left ) could force his way into the starting line - up for the tournament skills : @entity51 had an impressive season for @entity86 and could now start for @entity4 skipper @entity28 is delighted with the competition in the side ahead of the tournament			1
he told the @entity90 : ' it 's exciting			0
that 's why the supporters are excited			0
there are two quality players in every position			0
' the manager has gone on record today saying there are places available , which is why the training has been so high intensity and everyone has trained so well			0
everyone 's desperate to be one of those 11 places			0
' @entity108 on friday admitted that @entity7 knew ' seven or eight ' of his starting @entity109 , with forwards @entity110 and @entity112 almost certain to start alongside @entity22 , @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
we will be a lot closer to knowing who will occupy those final three places come full - time tonight			0
up front : @entity110 ( right ) and @entity112 ( left ) are set to start in attack for @entity7 's side decision time : @entity7 is confident he knows seven or eight players in his starting xi			1

@entity4 players are battling for a starting place in @entity7 's @entity3 team
@entity22 , @entity17 , @entity27 , @entity19 and @entity26 set to play
