by @entity0 published : 16:11 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 16:14 est , 13 october 2012 speaking out : soldier @entity1 , pictured , survived a friendly - fire attack and has accused ministers of covering up the @entity5 's failure to issue equipment that could have saved the lives of his colleagues a soldier who survived a friendly - fire attack has accused ministers of covering up the @entity5 ’s failure to issue equipment that could have saved the lives of his colleagues			1
@entity1 has made his claims ahead of a landmark court ruling that could pave the way for wounded servicemen or grieving families to sue the military over ‘ avoidable ’ deaths or injuries			1
the former trooper was in a @entity24 tank when it came under fire from another @entity27 on the fourth day of the @entity28			1
corporal @entity29 and trooper @entity30 died in the attack , while @entity32 and @entity34 @entity33 suffered severe injuries			1
all four were serving with the @entity36 attached to 1st @entity37			0
court papers seen by @entity39 show that the @entity40 had leased 47 state - of - the - art satellite recognition sets from the @entity42 which were capable of tracking friendly tank movements , but it failed to deploy them in the conflict			1
the surviving servicemen and @entity48 ’s widow @entity47 claim the government tried to cover up this failure by denying them information			2
they allege they were obstructed from seeing witness statements by other tank crews that revealed breakdowns in communication			2
later this month the @entity56 will rule on whether 27 - year - old mr @entity1 – who was medically discharged from the @entity5 in 2004 – @entity57 and mrs @entity58 have the right to sue the @entity40 for negligence			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity61 , who is now an accounts manager and is speaking for the first time about the friendly fire incident , says there was a lack of equipment , ranging from the high - tech tank - identification units to simple desert combat uniform			1
he remembers how , after he was injured , a corporal delivered a brutal assessment of his condition : ‘ the good news is you are still alive but the bad news is that i can see your bones protruding through both your legs			1
’ and he can recall in vivid detail the horror and confusion as the first round struck his tank while he and @entity82 were resting on top of the vehicle because of the heat			1
‘ people were shouting , “ get in the tank , ” ’ he said			1
‘ someone was saying , “ come on , quick get in the tank , he ’s dead , he ’s dead			1
” i suspect they were making reference to me because i could n’t move and i could n’t talk			0
‘ i just remember a buzzing noise in my ears and loads of screaming and shouting around the tank			1
i could n’t hear @entity29 [ @entity58 , who had been inside the tank with @entity99 ] any more			1
i was just hearing @entity101 [ @entity57 ] shouting and screaming			0
corporal @entity29 , left , and trooper @entity30 , centre , died in the attack , while @entity32 and @entity34 @entity33 , right , suffered severe injuries ‘ i was on the back deck of the tank at that point			1
i was n’t in any pain but i knew there was something up with my legs because there was like a warm sensation			0
@entity101 shouted at me and called my name			0
’ then he remembers his attention turning to the tank , where the turret was engulfed in flames			1
‘ i was focused on @entity99 and @entity29 [ @entity119 ]			1
i started calling their names but there was no response			0
while i was trying to crawl off the tank i remember hearing an explosion , like a second round , which blew me off the tank and caused me an injury to my head			0
’ as he lay on the ground he could see another tank coming towards him			1
‘ if i had remained there the likelihood is it would have run over me			0
i just had to crawl out of the way of the tank			0
there was a third round , which hit our tank			0
‘ this one exploded right near the hull , near the hatch , which then caused all the ammunition in the tank to go up			2
at first i thought we were under enemy attack but then a sergeant said , “ it ’s friendly fire , it ’s friendly fire			2
” ‘ i thought it was the @entity42			0
when i heard it was another @entity152 tank i was really angry , because all this training that they said they were supposed to provide , plus the kind of tank we were in , someone should know how to spot one of those tanks at night - time			0
‘ there was a lack of equipment , even standard gear like desert combats			0
we were going out in green combat gear			0
friendly identification tracking equipment was not in place although it was available			0
’ the @entity42 army was actually using it			0
there was other equipment that was readily available , which came to light after further investigations by his solicitors that could have been provided – identification and orientation equipment			0
horrific : the soldiers were in a @entity24 tank similar to this pictured when it came under fire from another @entity27 on the fourth day of the @entity28 ‘ it has always been a struggle to get information and documents from the mod. while i was in the forces it was , “ anything that happens in the @entity5 stays in the @entity5			1
” everything has taken place behind closed doors			0
' when i was trying to get information on the equipment , there were people who had expertise in that field who could provide that information but were n’t able to do so because they had contracts with the @entity40 ’ mr @entity1 ’s allegations were echoed at @entity29 ’s inquest in 2007 , in which coroner @entity203 concluded the deaths and injuries were ‘ completely avoidable ’ and blamed the @entity5 for poor communication			1
the injured soldiers and mrs @entity58 were given permission by a high court judge to bring a claim of negligence against the @entity40 but the government has instructed top barristers , at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds , to block this in the @entity56			0
the claimants also now fear that controversial plans to bring in ‘ secret courts ’ to hear cases involving sensitive material will serve only to further obstruct their fight for justice			2
@entity224 , of mr @entity1 ’s solicitors @entity226 , said : ‘ families of soldiers are frustrated in their attempts to seek truth and justice at the very outset under the @entity5 ’s @entity234 rules , which preclude victims and their families from participating			1
frustration : the injured soldiers were given permission by a high court judge to bring a claim of negligence against the mod. but the government has instructed top barristers , at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds , to block this in the @entity56 , pictured ‘ in the @entity245 inquest the soldier ’s family and the two injured soldiers were not provided with a full unredacted copy of the @entity234 ’s findings and an accompanying explanation			2
’ she said that at the inquest the @entity40 had taken an obstructive approach by censoring nearly all of the @entity234 material and other relevant investigations			0
accusing the @entity40 of ‘ a lack of openness and transparency ’ , she said : ‘ we had to fight hard to get crucial material unredacted and it was only done after the coroner also insisted			2
‘ for example , the @entity264 had interviewed several soldiers [ who were the crew in the firing tank ] as they had been investigated for gross negligence			2
‘ the interview transcripts were withheld under the pretext the @entity40 needed to get permission from the soldiers before providing them			0
‘ although such documents were ultimately provided , this was very late in the day			2
the victims are left with a feeling that they need to fight for every bit of information			0
’ the @entity40 , which declined to comment on the case , argues that the questions surrounding military equipment and operational deployment are matters for @entity285 rather than the courts			2
it also says that if the court finds in favour of mr @entity1 and the others , it will have a damaging effect on morale .			1
