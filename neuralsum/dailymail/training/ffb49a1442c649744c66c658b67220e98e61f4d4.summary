by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 16:38 est , 14 march 2014 @entity2 has received heavy criticism for her makeup and hair choices in a world of blonde glamazon tv presenters , @entity2 stands out			1
she 's a teeny 5ft 2in , is very often mahogany thanks to her love of fake tan , and has a fringe so long she can barely see through it			1
as for her love of eyeliner ; she makes the @entity16 ladies look restrained			1
and while most female presenters sashay down the red carpet perfectly coiffed in revealing designer dresses , well , @entity2 's a bit different there too			1
at the @entity22 last month she attracted almost as much attention as @entity24 , but not necessarily for the right reasons			1
most people were asking if she did her make - up in the dark			1
the answer is not quite in the dark , but in the back of a cab on the way to the event			1
the result was wonky , smudged eyeliner that snaked half - way down her cheek			1
' oh , i 've lost my make - up artist so much work , ' she groans , head in her hands			1
what , she actually had a make - up artist that day ? ' oh no , not for the @entity22 , ' she laughs			1
' only for when i 'm working			1
having one for the @entity22 would feel ridiculous , very @entity52 normally if i 'm at an event and there are superstars there no one gives a monkey 's what i 'm wearing			1
at least , not unless my make - up is magnificently bad			1
' she says that on the day of the @entity22 she got dressed in a hurry and did her eyeliner ' blind ' in the cab			1
when she glanced in her compact mirror she was ' genuinely delighted ' as she 's always liked a bit of smudge			1
' only this time i may have overdone it			1
' being a non-model in a world full of them , @entity2 's safety mechanism is to always look the same and not compare herself - particularly to her @entity69 co-star @entity70			1
' i 'm a weird , dark - haired , orange person , ' she says			1
' @entity70 is stunning , the most beautiful creature on @entity72			1
we 're so different i ca n't even try to compare us			1
if i did i 'd never leave the house			2
i 've never really experimented with my looks but whatever experimentation there was has long gone			2
@entity79 skin , white lips , smudged eye - make - up and a fringe make me happy			1
so i 'm going with that			2
' if people have strong opinions about the eye - liner it 's nothing compared with the fuss about the fringe			1
it hit its height last year when she appeared on the first series of reality show @entity94 and it became known as the most irritating fringe on tv			1
there was even a @entity99 account dedicated to it			2
at the @entity22 last month @entity2 was continually asked if she 'd put her makeup on in the dark ... turns out she 'd put it on in a taxi @entity2 , 42 , reveals that before filming started on this year 's show a producer told her she needed to get it cut			1
' i was properly told to cut it , ' she whispers huskily			1
' they said , “ this is getting ridiculous			2
” ' who said ? ' i 'd better not tell you because then i 'd definitely lose my job , but they said , “ i 'm not sure what point you 're trying to make with it			2
” so i squeaked , “ i 'm not trying to make a point			2
” so they said , “ @entity119			2
” ' but is n't it nicer to be able to actually see ? ' well i 've never been able to see , i 've had a gazillion operations on my eyes anyway ( she 's severely short - sighted and has had laser treatment to improve her vision )			2
but i do live in a strange paradox			2
' my daughter has a fringe and i 'm obsessed with cutting it so she can see when she goes to school			1
mine 's getting longer while hers is above her eyebrows			2
i feel naked if it 's too short and , trust me , no one would want to see my forehead			2
you would be physically sick			2
at @entity137 recently i saw @entity138 from @entity139 in reception and her fringe swept down to her chin			1
she had to part it to talk to people			2
that 's where i 'll end up , i hope			2
i wo n't be able to do that in tv , but in life i hope that 's where i 'll be			2
' when presenting the @entity94 , @entity2 was told to cut her fringe as it was ' getting ridiculous ' for now @entity2 's so busy her fringe will have to stay above her eyes			1
her most high - profile role is presenting @entity69 's sunday night results show and filling in for @entity154 if he takes time off			2
she insists she could never see herself filling his shoes for good though			0
' @entity154 will definitely be back			0
i 'd never want to take over from him			0
' she 's also presenting the second series of @entity94 , has her arts show on @entity137 and presents film 2014			1
and next friday she 'll be one of the main anchors for @entity162			0
she says she was amazed at the sporting antics of her friend @entity164 , who did a 500 - mile triathlon for the charity			0
although i 'd love to do anything i can for this charity - they astound me with what they do - i 've never done any exercise so i could n't do that			0
' ' i 've exceeded all my ambitions			1
all my jobs are dream jobs			0
' as well as showing us @entity164 's trials , the fundraising marathon will include a special edition of @entity181 starring @entity182 and there 'll be a @entity69 special featuring four paralympians			0
meanwhile two celebrity teams , headed by @entity187 champ @entity186 and comedian @entity188 , will compete in sporting challenges at the @entity190 live on the show			0
the teams , which include @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 , will perform events such as rhythmic gymnastics , track cycling and swimming			0
' we 've got lots of brilliant people also hosting , like @entity205 and @entity206 and @entity207 as well as @entity164 , so i 'm just going to take my cue from them , ' insists @entity2			1
' that 's the key			0
' she 's terribly self - effacing when she talks ; it 's hard to know how much she means it			0
a @entity216 graduate whose mother @entity217 was a @entity218 editor and father @entity219 a publisher , she says while she was ambitious once , she is n't any more			0
@entity2 with her @entity221 , @entity70 , who she describes as ' the most beautiful person in the world ' ' i 've exceeded all my ambitions			1
all my jobs are dream jobs			0
' in the past her work schedule - and its clash with that of her husband , film producer @entity229 - led to problems between them , but they seem to have things sorted now			0
she gave up @entity69 's companion evening show @entity239 so she could be at home more for their children , @entity243 , ten , @entity244 , seven , and @entity245 , two			0
and in the summer the family decamped for nine weeks to @entity247 where @entity229 was making his latest movie trash , due out this year			0
not working for those weeks made her realise just how much she loved her job ; that it was n't just to keep the kids in @entity253			0
' i 'd never want to do too much because things suffer at home but i also know now that i 'd be rubbish if i did nothing			0
when i was with the kids all the time things felt hectic and i got a bit screechy			0
i used to say to my son when he was young that i had to work to buy bananas			0
one evening i was leaving and he was upset and said , “ @entity265 , you do n't have to go , we 've got bananas			0
” so i told him the truth ; i like working			0
i like being with people and using my brain			0
' @entity229 , who produced one chance , last year 's film about @entity274 's @entity273 winner @entity272 , used to be known as a man - about - town while @entity2 's always been a homebody ( ' i went to a nightclub once , and i thought it was too noisy and a fire hazard ' )			1
while she was at the @entity22 , he was taking the children dry - slope skiing			0
' i love him so much , ' she says with a fond smile			0
' he 's obsessed with teaching our kids to ski even though neither of us has done it			0
' her perfect weekend would be spent ' lolloping ' with the family			0
' i love being inside , ' she says			0
' if i can get my daughter sewing with me - nothing more than a few cuffs because if you think my eyeliner 's wonky , you should see my sewing - and the baby 's wandering around trying to sit on the kitten and my big son 's reading on the sofa with his dad , i 'm in heaven			0
' i was born this dull , ' she adds			0
' but the wild years are coming			0
i love getting older and when i 'm 62 i plan to be wearing a kaftan			0
i 'll have eyeliner all over my face and my fringe will be down to my waist			1
' @entity162 , friday , 7pm , @entity306 .			0
