it has been 16 years since @entity1 and @entity2 have arguably played in a match of such magnitude			1
it ’s mere coincidence that the game would also be @entity9 ’s last appearance as a player in the @entity11			0
the @entity13 club triumphed 2 - 1 on that occasion , lifting the @entity15 to end a 36 - year trophy drought			1
tomorrow , the stakes are rather different — as are the circumstances of both clubs			0
a win for either could go a long way to deciding the destination of the @entity24 title and an automatic ticket back to the top flight from which they had plunged in varying states of disarray			1
this fixture against @entity1 is one @entity2 boss @entity9 will see as a must - win victory for the @entity33 @entity34 of @entity1 scores his side 's opening goal against @entity2 in their 2 - 1 win at @entity38 in august @entity39 , who played in that victory for @entity1 at @entity41 back in 1998 , knows the rival bosses well			1
he played alongside @entity43 at @entity13 , while @entity9 coached him at international level with @entity45			1
and the 36 - year - old , currently player / manager of @entity47 , believes a victory for his former side would pretty much seal the title before november is out			2
‘ it ’s those two teams fighting it out at the top of the league and if @entity1 win , i do n’t see them losing a nine - point lead , ’ said @entity39			1
‘ it ’s a massive game for @entity1 because they have a great chance in front of 20,000 people to go nine clear after just more than a third of the season gone			2
but it ’s an even bigger game for @entity2 , because they know losing would see them fall so far behind			1
‘ i would n’t say @entity2 have got a better squad and , with the players @entity67 has assembled at @entity1 , he would be disappointed not to win the league			1
‘ his priority at the start of the season would have been to get @entity1 up but after such a good start , he will be wanting to go up as champions			2
‘ it ’s all in @entity1 ’ hands and i think even a draw would suit them			2
so it ’s going to be a cracking occasion and a definite sell - out			2
@entity9 looks on as his side prepare for what could be @entity2 ' biggest game of the season @entity85 and @entity86 celebrate @entity1 ' cup win against @entity2 at @entity41 16 years ago ‘ depending on the result , though , the games between @entity1 and @entity2 later on in the season could be even bigger than this one as the points may be closer			1
‘ but you have to make @entity1 favourites because they ’re six clear and playing at home			2
’ should his side lose tomorrow , there are those speculating it may signal the beginning of the end of @entity9 ’s colourful tenure as manager of the club he loves			0
in a three - year spell , the all - time @entity2 record scorer has been lauded for his off - the - field firefighting while facing regular questions over his ability to lead his side on the park			1
asked if he fears for @entity9 ’s future should they lose , @entity39 countered by insisting the 52 - year - old has experience of dealing with such pressure			1
‘ the speculation is just the nature of the job , ’ said @entity39			2
‘ @entity2 won seven on the bounce , then they draw against @entity118 and all of a sudden @entity119 ’s in the last - chance saloon			1
i think he ’s probably immune to it by now			0
water off a duck ’s back			0
‘ while @entity2 are in turmoil , they ’re going to be front and back - page news			1
but @entity119 was used to being in the headlines as a player and it ’s probably not that hard for him to cope with it			0
@entity1 will be looking for another win against @entity2 in the return fixture at @entity13 ‘ he does n’t let it affect him			1
when we played them recently , he came in before the game for 40 minutes for a cup of tea and a chat			0
@entity119 always makes time for you			0
i do n’t know if that ’s normal or that he just likes me because of our time with @entity45 but he ’s just a guy i really respect			0
‘ i think he ’s done a good job because he has been the glue that ’s held that club together			0
i ’m not sure anyone else could have done that			0
‘ also , they are second in the league behind a very good @entity1 side and , if they cut it to three points on saturday , then it ’s all to play for			2
’ @entity39 worked alongside @entity43 at @entity47 before he was headhunted by the @entity13 club and the @entity47 boss believes @entity1 ’ start to the season – 11 wins , two draws , no defeats – clearly marks him out as the coming manager of @entity164 football			1
‘ it ’s a fantastic achievement to be 13 games unbeaten , ’ he said			0
‘ they have only conceded seven goals and scored 35 goals so it ’s working for @entity67 at both ends			0
‘ @entity172 and @entity173 deserve credit , too , for giving the younger players experience of the @entity176 last season			0
@entity67 is getting the benefit from that , as well as the changes he has implemented himself			0
‘ undoubtedly , his director of football , @entity181 , will have advised him to sign guys like @entity183 and @entity184 , who he has worked with before at @entity185			0
but @entity43 ’s his own man and he ’s gone up and up in coaching and deserves all the credit in the world			0
’ * @entity39 was speaking to promote and @entity191 - ) event at @entity192 in @entity47 , in conjunction with @entity194 and the @entity195			1

hearts take on @entity2 in @entity24 top of the table clash
@entity13 club can open a nine - point advantage over @entity2 with a win
former @entity205 *defender* @entity39 : ' if @entity1 win , i do n’t see them losing a nine - point lead '
