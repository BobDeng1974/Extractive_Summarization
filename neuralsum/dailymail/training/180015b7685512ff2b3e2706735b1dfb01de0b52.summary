the rise of do - it - yourself porn is devastating the mainstream industry as increasing numbers of ' amateurs ' use the internet to upload homemade sex videos			1
traditional porn stars are being replaced by everyday people who upload porn to sites like @entity11 or build up a fan following through live web cam sites such as @entity14			1
the growth is concerning the mainstream porn industry , which has seen a huge decline in profits			1
sites such as @entity14 ( pictured ) allow ' amateurs ' to post explicit images and videos in the past porn stars such as @entity24 were as famous as actors and musicians but there are few household names now			1
instead , diy porn is increasingly popular and people can upload pictures or video of themselves on a whim - and with a good chance of anonymity if they want it			1
performances are also almost totally unregulated , especially if the performance if live			0
in 1998 , a study by @entity40 on the porn industry - including paraphernalia , internet , cable television and magazines - estimated it was worth up to $ 10billion			1
this year , the worldwide industry is estimated to be worth up to $ 5billion - however , it is difficult to know how accurate these figures are			2
the mainstream industry has been hit not only through piracy and free content , but people choosing to pay to watch live sex acts over the internet			1
the porn industry once had household names such as @entity24 , star of @entity58 ( right ) , who was so famous a movie ( left ) has been made about her life increasing numbers of ' regular ' people are treating web cam porn - or ' camming ' - as their main job and believe it brings less stigma than being unemployed			1
' @entity68 ' told @entity69 that his job allows him to earn money while he stays at home caring for his six - year - old daughter while his wife works			0
he admits he does worry that being paid to perform sex acts and strip over a web camera will impact on his wife and daughter			2
but he added : ' but there ’s such a stigma around the long - term unemployed now that i ’m not sure it could be much worse			0
' sites like @entity84 emulate traditional strip clubs where viewers ' tip ' the performers			2
as in strip clubs , people can pay for private performances			2
it is also possible to interact with the performers through the web cam			0
users of @entity11 say they not only post pictures for money or notoriety but to give themselves a confidence boost webcams have allowed people to become porn stars in their own home ' @entity68 ' said he can receive tips of up to $ 100 a time			1
but the real change in pornography is the number of people who are doing it for no payment at all			0
so - called tube sites - that imitate @entity111 and allow anyone to upload content - have doubled in a year to 1,000			1
she told @entity115 the positive reaction was ' totally overwhelming ' and that she would post further pictures if she needed a confidence boost			0
users can rate the content and the more positive the reaction , the more prominent it is displayed on the site			0
she said : ' i ’d like to do it again			0
people on reddit said i have to show more flesh to make my posts successful , though			0
i ’ll probably do it when i need a pick - me - up			0
' mainstream porn companies are worried about the rise of amateur porn			1
@entity133 reported that @entity135 orders from distributers have shrunk this year to about 1,500 from 5,00 to 6,000 in 2005			0
@entity137 , who founded porn company @entity138 , told the newspaper : ' we 're dealing with a perfect storm : decliing dvd sales , rampant piracy , free content and a weak economy			0
' piracy , as in the film and music industries , is causing huge problems for mainstream porn companies			2
@entity151 , an editor at @entity152 , which covers the porn industry , told @entity133 : ' the tubes are making money off the studio 's investment of time and money , while the studios are forced to spend ever larger chunks tof change to police the tubes and send endless takedown notices			2

sites *chaturbate* and @entity11 allow *normal* people to upload sex videos
