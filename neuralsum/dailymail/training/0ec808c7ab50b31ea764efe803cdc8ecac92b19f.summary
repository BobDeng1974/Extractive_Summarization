by @entity0 the rising generation , which is known as @entity2 , wants more healthy and fresh ingredients than the older portion of the population ever did			2
according to a new report by market research group @entity7 , the youngest generation of consumers - which includes everyone up to the age of 23 - is more inclined to eat fresh greens and home - cooked meals than their predecessors , @entity15 and @entity16 this signals an overall trend toward healthier eating , says the report			1
generation salad : according to a new report by @entity7 market research group , @entity2 ( everyone up to age 23 ) is more inclined to eat fresh ingredients and home - cooked meals than their predecessors fresh food consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next five years , due to the eating habits of @entity2 , with salad consumption in particular on the rise			1
also forecast to increase are the consumption of savory snacks and ' better - for - you ' snack foods like dried fruit and granola bars , as well as sandwiches and breakfasts that require some cooking			0
indeed , @entity2 exhibits a tendency to use stove tops instead of microwaves for preparing meals			1
this is in contrast to gen x consumers ( considered as everyone between the ages of 38 and 48 ) , who are more focused on convenience and therefore more likely to prepare microwaveable foods			1
in fact , the rising generation tends to spend more time in general in the kitchen , meaning home - made breakfasts like omelets and @entity57 toast are set to overtake packaged cereals and oatmeal			0
trends : also forecast to increase are the consumption of savory snacks and ' better - for - you ' snack foods like dried fruit and granola bars , as well as sandwiches and breakfasts that require some cooking involved : @entity66 , @entity7 food and beverage industry analyst , says gen z ' wants to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project ' @entity66 , @entity7 food and beverage industry analyst , pointed out on his blog that it may seem counter-intuitive that the younger generation - which is typically time - pressed - is spending more time in the kitchen			2
but he explains the logic behind it , writing : ' there seems to be a need to have their say or approval on the final product			0
' it 's almost as if they want to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project			0
' changing habits : fresh food consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next five years , and the consumption of convenient microwaveable meals will decrease he added that younger consumers are increasingly using additives - i.e. putting fruits or syrups on their foods - for the same reason , to feel more involved in the overall process			1
judging by growing food trends , having what is typically considered a side dish as a main meal is another eating habit that will continue to become more popular			0
and with @entity115 making up a large percentage of @entity117 as well as gen z , the @entity7 expects the consumption of @entity115 foods to grow by seven per cent in the next five years .			0
