and its not just his prowess in the pool that has made the @entity51 and @entity13 silver medallist so popular : with his dark hair and honed torso , the swimmer , who is currently based in @entity53 , has proved a hit with the ladies as well			0
@entity30 , @entity29 , judo the newly crowned @entity13 judo champion , @entity30 is arguably the best known member of @entity62 's judo stars - thanks , in part , to a stint on celebrity big brother , where he managed a respectable fifth place			2
when not starring in reality tv shows , the 25 - year - old athlete has been making waves in the world of judo and is currently number one in @entity74 , although unfortunately , he failed to make it past the second round during the @entity77			0
his @entity13 win ( and extremely good looks ) suggest he 's one to watch			0

tune in tomorrow for his first outing at @entity42 2014 - in a group match against the @entity99			1
@entity20 , @entity21 , athletics the world 's fastest man hardly needs introducing , having swept all before him - both on and off the track - since exploding onto the scene during the @entity105			2

the @entity142 will face some stiff competition in order to triumph however , with defending champion , @entity29 's @entity146 , and @entity23 's @entity147 among those to beat			1
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity84 at 6ft 2 " tall and weighing in at nearly 15st , handsome rugby sevens star @entity22 , 28 , is a formidable opponent for any team taking on the @entity149 - as is his identical twin brother , @entity151 star @entity150			2
currently the vice-captain of @entity23 's sevens side , @entity22 ( and his compatriots ) are convinced that this could be the year that the team take home a @entity13 gold			1
they will , however , have to get past the equally impressive @entity29 and @entity132 to do it			0
double trouble : @entity160 ' star @entity28 is expecting a baby with his girlfriend while @entity23 sevens star @entity22 has an identical twin brother yellow peril : @entity22 is the @entity149 vice captain and has high hopes of taking home a @entity13 gold - if he and his men can beat favourites , @entity29 and @entity132 @entity28 , @entity29 , athletics the man from @entity160 is only the second @entity116 long jumper to take @entity51 gold - and boasts fiery good looks that are almost as impressive as his sporting achievements			2
