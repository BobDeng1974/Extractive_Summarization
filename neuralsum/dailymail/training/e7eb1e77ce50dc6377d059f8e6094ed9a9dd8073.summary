’ items returned included two rings , bracelets , necklaces and @entity10 ’s earrings and were handed back in the past few weeks			1

jealous , violent ex-partner : @entity9 ( right ) shot ms @entity7 and @entity10 at their home in @entity12 , @entity13 before he shot himself but survived ( left ) blunder : @entity92 had been criticised over the case for their handling of harassment reports toward ms @entity17 leading up to the attack in which police tried to negotiate with @entity30 while he had ms @entity17 and @entity10 inside the house a police spokesman said every effort had been made to clean up the items but accepted mistakes had been made during the cleaning process			1

murder weapon : the shotgun used by @entity9 to kill his former partner and her two - year - old daughter ‘ the delay in returning property was largely due to waiting to see if @entity30 would be appealing against his conviction or sentence			2
’ this is the latest blunder by the force over the crime which was criticised earlier this year for the way it handled reports of harassment towards ms @entity17 in the lead up to her untimely death			1
an @entity145 revealed the tragedy may have been avoided if action had been taken earlier to arrest the former nightclub bouncer			0
an investigation heard that @entity30 stormed ms @entity7 ’ house and blasted her and their daughter @entity10 with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him			1
worried calls : ms @entity17 ( pictured with @entity10 and her 10 - year - old daughter ) had made many calls to police in the lead up to the double - murder after her relationship with @entity30 ended ' poorly resourced ' : @entity92 say they have improved its response to domestic abuse incidents after the deaths of @entity10 ( pictured ) and ms @entity17 the damning report showed how @entity92 officers failed to act despite a surge in the number of worried phone calls from ms @entity17 in the two months leading up to the horrific double killing after they were told her relationship with @entity30 had ended			1
@entity30 was known to be ‘ bullying and controlling ’ yet ‘ inadequate action ’ was taken to arrest him at the earliest opportunity when he breached a non-molestation order			0

the investigation said police had failed to realise that ms @entity17 ’ fear of @entity30 was a potential motivation for her not pursuing complaints against him			1
and the @entity189 also said @entity92 ’s specialist domestic abuse investigation teams were ‘ poorly resourced ’ with a substantial backlog in inputting domestic violence forms on the force intelligence system			0
@entity92 says it has learnt from the tragic incident and has improved its response to domestic abuse incidents			0
at @entity30 ’ trial , the @entity197 heard that @entity30 ' systematically tortured ' ms @entity17 for several hours before the killings , forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair			2

police have been *critcised* for their insensitivity
they had been criticised earlier for their handling of harassment reports by ms @entity17 in the lead up to the attack
