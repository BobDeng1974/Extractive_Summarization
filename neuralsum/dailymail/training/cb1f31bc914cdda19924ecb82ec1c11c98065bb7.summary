by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin and @entity1 @entity2 is set to cash in on his return to top - level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for @entity9 ’s @entity8 home matches			1
it is understood that @entity2 , who is hopeful of ending his five - year absence from the game on friday as @entity9 host roses rivals @entity14 at @entity15 , will receive £ 1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure — possibly 8,000			1
the county ’s two home matches so far in the @entity20 have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against @entity22 and 5,900 against @entity23			1
laughing all the way to the bank : @entity2 will receive a payment per fan for @entity9 's home games last year ’s home fixture against @entity14 drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any of their four other @entity8 games in @entity34			1
since @entity36 , fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in @entity39 ’s defeat by @entity40 at @entity41 on saturday , may also be available for selection for @entity9 , the opportunity will be there for @entity2 to add a few thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses			1
@entity2 is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals @entity14 , but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘ cricket reasons ’			1
@entity2 , 36 , came through a low - key playing comeback on saturday by helping @entity51 beat @entity52 in a lowly @entity54 game			1
comeback : @entity2 returned to cricket when he played for @entity51 on saturday low key : the former @entity39 all - rounder took three wickets on his return to the game he took three wickets including a stunning caught and bowled			1
but he knows if he gets selected for @entity9 on the big stage now , somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons			1
‘ i ’d be lying to you if i said i did n’t think about playing against @entity14 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it will be a full house , however , friday is a long way away , it really is — if i get a go , i get a go but i ’m not by any means expecting to play			1
‘ on thursday i ’ve got a game with the @entity75 second team , which i ’m just going to go out there and enjoy			1
i ’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself thinking that this is a trial for friday or anything like that			1
i ’m just going to play — and if i get picked , i get picked			2
‘ if i ’m going to play then someone else is going to miss out			2
they ’ve got to be comfortable that , when they tell the player who is missing out , it ’s the right decision for cricket reasons			2
and i need to be comfortable with that as well			2
‘ so it ’s all down to cricket , down to what value i can give the side and whether i can give more than the person i take over from			2
’ after saturday ’s cameo , which include facing three balls as a batsman before being caught on the boundary attempting a six , he stressed how the competition for @entity9 is especially tough now			2
realistic : @entity2 said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback @entity99 : @entity2 has set his sights on playing against rivals @entity14 on friday night ‘ i ’m not putting too much pressure on myself , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ i ’m not making big hopes			2
‘ i ’m just going to see where it goes			2
i appreciate that @entity9 are on a roll in @entity106 and there ’s @entity36 and @entity108 and people to come back into that side			0
‘ so it ’s not a gim me that i ’m going to play			0
but i ’m going to try to put myself in the frame			0
the comeback has just crept up on me			0
it ’s not something that was a goal of mine , that i set out to do			0
‘ it has just come around quite innocently and that ’s been the nice thing about it			0
i ’m not chasing anything			0
i ’m just enjoying it			0
why should n’t i ? i like cricket			0
’ with @entity2 offered a portion of the @entity15 gate for his return to top - level cricket , @entity125 takes a look at other stipulations which sports stars have requested ... @entity133 @entity133 shocked football by moving from @entity135 to @entity136 in 1982 , dropping down a division			1
club sponsors @entity139 had to help pay his £ 5,000 - a - week wages			1
@entity141 the @entity143 manager agreed to become the coach of @entity145 in 2002 , but only with the proviso that if war broke out in the country he could leave			0
@entity149 when the striker joined @entity151 in 1996 he demanded the @entity143 football club build him a house for every year of his contract			0
he was there for three years			0
@entity156 the @entity158 footballer insisted @entity159 put in his contract that they would arrange cooking lessons for his wife , when he signed for them in 1999			0
@entity163 when the former @entity165 striker made the surprise move to @entity168 side @entity167 he had it written into his contract that should @entity170 express interest he would be free to leave			0
