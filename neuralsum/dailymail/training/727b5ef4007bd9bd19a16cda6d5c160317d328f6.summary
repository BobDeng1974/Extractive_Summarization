@entity0 turned @entity3 's @entity2 semi-final against @entity4 on its head with two goals in two minutes , but his manager @entity7 was left ruing the attacker celebrating his first goal			1
after replacing @entity10 on 74 , @entity0 slotted clinically past @entity11 from a narrow angle to haul @entity3 back into the cup tie			2
@entity14 erupted and clearly swept up the 18 - year - old @entity0 into the emotion as he ran off to celebrate rather than picking the ball out of the net with his team still chasing another goal			1

' we like the look of him , he is raw and has a lot of potential			0
but he needs to learn not to celebrate when we are chasing another goal			2
' @entity7 's cold remark will undoubtedly draw comparisons to his father , @entity46			2
