by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 03:14 est , 25 march 2013 drivers are set to face a financial squeeze over the coming weeks , as the price of petrol will rise while the economy continues to struggle			2
@entity6 attempted to ease the pain in last week 's budget by cancelling a proposed 3p increase in fuel duty , but the move appears to have had little effect			1
the average petrol price has risen by 5.5 per cent in just two months , with a 4p rise in february , meaning that in some parts of @entity16 it costs £ 100 to fill up the family car			1
pain at the pumps : the cost of petrol has risen by 4p a litre over the past month alone the price hike has been attributed to high global oil prices as well as the fall in the value of the pound , which makes imports more expensive			1
but research from @entity29 suggests that no respite is on the horizon , with the cost of fuel set to rise again in the short term			0
the average price of a litre of petrol nationwide is currently 137.95p , with a litre of diesel costing 129.9p on average			1
according to @entity29 , that means a motorist who drives 1,000 miles a month in a car going 35 miles per gallon must spend £ 180 per month on transport			0
on the rise : prices dropped in the final months of 2012 but jumped again in january , february and march ' with the cost of fuel expected to reach its highest level in the coming weeks , families and car commuters are likely to be the hardest hit once again , ' said @entity51 , chief executive of @entity29			2
' aside from mortgage costs , households in the @entity16 already spend more on transport than any other living cost			0
further hikes may well push many family budgets over the edge			0
' there are a number of small changes people can make to reduce these costs , such as car - pooling with colleagues , driving more economically or using public transport			0
' the price of petrol usually rises as the weather gets warmer , suggesting that motorists will not be given a financial reprieve any time soon			0
breakdown : @entity72 rises in fuel prices are caused by increases in tax and not price - fixing by oil companies mr @entity6 has repeatedly tried to spare drivers from the government 's austerity programme by freezing fuel duty			1
however , even though two thirds of the price of petrol is made up of tax , the chancellor has been unable to do anything to combat the global economic factors which have been relentlessly pushing up motorists ' costs			2
campaigners are calling for a cut in duty to help stimulate the economy			0
a spokesman for @entity95 told the @entity96 : ' despite the positive @entity100 news that the september rise in fuel duty is cancelled , petrol and diesel prices are still outrageously high			1
' the @entity16 economy needs a substantial cut in fuel duty in order to stimulate growth			2

average litre of petrol costs 138p with motorists paying £ 100 to fill tank
cost has *soared* 5.5 *%* in two months thanks to oil price and weak pound
@entity6 's freeze in fuel duty has done little to curb *soaring* prices
