a new leaked email written to @entity4 studio @entity2 head shows one producer saying that @entity6 does not do well for the company because he is black			1
in the exchange , written about the @entity10 winning star 's recent role in the film @entity14 , the producer says that @entity15 does not do well at the worldwide box office because of the color of his skin			1
the producer then blames this on the racism of @entity23 audiences			1
' writes the producer of @entity15 , ' casting him is saying we ’re ok with a double if the picture works			0
' a double as opposed to a homerun			0
they then add ; ' he ’s reliable at the domestic [ box office ] , safe , but has not had a huge success in years			1
i believe whenever possible the non event pictures , extra ‘ bets ’ should have a large inherent upside and be made for the right price			0
here there is n’t a large inherent upside			0
' this despite the fact that @entity15 is not only one of the greatest actors of his generation , but also one of the biggest and most consistent box office stars			1
perhaps most shocking though is that this email was written about @entity14 after the film did incredibly well overseas			1
as @entity40 reports , ' @entity15 ’s @entity14 grossed $ 191 million at theaters worldwide , with 47 % of the ticket sales coming from outside of the @entity74			0
the producer then writes , ' i believe that the international motion picture audience is racist — in general pictures with an @entity80 lead do n’t play well overseas			1
' it is unknown who the producer is , and @entity15 and @entity2 have yet to comment on this latest leak			2
this as the group behind the hack , @entity85 , have been successful in their goal of shutting down @entity4 's film @entity89 , a comedy about the assassination of @entity93 leader @entity92			2
@entity4 pulled the planned @entity95 release of the picture after the hackers threatened 9/11 - like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy			2
what 's more , the film may never be released at all			0
' @entity4 has no further release plans for the film , ' said a spokesperson for the studio wednesday evening			1
this despite the fact that the film cost $ 42million to make and tens of millions to market			0
almost immediately , many in @entity109 voiced their concern , with writer @entity111 saying how upset he was that ' the @entity74 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech by a group of @entity93 terrorists , ' and director @entity118 explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward			0
federal government officials have said that @entity93 is behind the hack , as has been assumed for the past two weeks , though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week			0
authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside @entity4 helped the hackers .			2

a new email leaked by hackers *reveals* that one producer believes @entity6 has no worldwide box office appeal because he is black
the producer , writing to @entity4 studio head @entity2 , says that his numbers are n't good enough when compared to other actors
that si blamed on the ' racist ' *attitudes* of @entity23 audiences by the producer , who is not named
this despite the fact that the film in question , the *equalizer* , made half of its money overseas
