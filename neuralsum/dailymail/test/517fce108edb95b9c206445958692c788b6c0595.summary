@entity0 , 48 , lost his case at the @entity2 millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that £ 85 was not an ' excessively high ' penalty for staying too long in a car park			1
@entity0 launched a legal bid to overturn his fine , saying it was unfair , disproportionate and unenforceable			1
but in a landmark ruling , appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ' extravagant or unconscionable '			1
motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision , accusing the judges – who are thought to earn more than £ 200,000 a year – of being ' out of touch '			2
mr @entity0 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , had gone to court to fight what he called the ' bullying and threatening ' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces			1
the 48 - year - old , who runs a fish and chip shop , got the £ 85 fine in april 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the @entity33 park in @entity20			1
the car park , run by parking firm @entity35 , allowed two hours of free parking , but mr @entity0 stayed for three			1
he claimed the £ 85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who ' extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up '			1
but yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not ' excessively high '			0
mr @entity0 said he was ' absolutely furious ' and planned to appeal			0
meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit - hungry firms ' falling over themselves ' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose			0
@entity52 , of the @entity53 , said : ' i think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think £ 85 is n't extravagant			1
' an £ 85 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer – it 's probably less than many charge for an hour			2
but for the average hard - pressed motorist trying to make ends meet , it 's a very heavy and unfair burden			0
' professor @entity64 , director of the @entity65 , said the ruling would hand parking firms a ' blank cheque ' to milk drivers , adding : ' this decision could cost motorists millions			0
' if judges believe £ 85 is not an extravagant amount then what is ? £ 100 ? £ 200 ? our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers			1
' mr @entity0 had parked his car at the @entity81 in @entity20 , pictured above , on april 15 , 2013 , the retail site , pictured above , offers two free hours of parking and mr @entity0 was fined after he returned 56 minutes late @entity85 , executive director of consumer watchdog which ? , said : ' we are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges			2
' and @entity93 president @entity92 said : ' @entity95 's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider £ 85 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty			2
£ 85 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash - strapped motorists			2
' he added : ' this is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque - book and invited to make up the figures as they like			0
' speaking outside of the @entity2 mr @entity0 said he would now be taking the case to the @entity113 parking trap : many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time the three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge – lord justice @entity120 , @entity122 and sir @entity123 – are all thought to earn around £ 202,000 a year			1
yesterday @entity35 welcomed the judgment , saying it gave ' clarity to motorists and the parking industry ' and ' further confirms that our parking charges are fair , reasonable and legally enforceable '			0
but speaking outside court , mr @entity0 said : ' these firms are not run on a moral basis , they 're only out to make as much money as they can , to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists			0
i am utterly furious and will continue the fight			0
' mr @entity0 's action comes after the @entity138 revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes – in car parks at hospitals , railway stations and shopping centres			0
cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms			0
three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the @entity2 , saying the amount he was charged ' is not extravagant or unconscionable ' .			2

@entity0 took on private car park operators over ' unfair ' charges
48 - year - old tried to challenge £ 85 fine that he claimed was unjust
left ' furious ' after losing the landmark legal bid at the @entity161
judges found the charge was ' not extravagant or unconscionable '
