by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 12:36 est , 26 september 2013 a new island that emerged off the coast of @entity3 following a devastating earthquake has been releasing flammable gas and killing sea life in the area			1
dead fish have been spotted floating on the surface of the waters surrounding the island and visitors have heard hissing noises from the escaping gas			1
the island was created following 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of @entity17 in @entity3 's quake - prone province of @entity20 , which borders @entity21 , on tuesday			1
a new island that emerged off the coast of @entity3 following a devastating earthquake has been releasing flammable gas and killing sea life in the area the earthquake was so powerful that it caused the seabed to rise and create a small , mountain - like island about 600 meters off @entity3 's @entity30 coastline in the @entity31			1
@entity32 , a local journalist told the @entity33 how residents could hear sounds of gas escaping			0
' although they could n't smell gas , they did put a match to the fissures from where it was oozing , and set it on fire , ' he said			0
' we put the fire out in the end , but it was quite a hassle			0
not even the water could kill it , unless one poured buckets over it			0
' an aerial view of the island which is thought to be about 60 feet ( 18 meters ) high , 100 feet ( 30 meters ) long and 250 feet ( 76 meters ) wide a @entity3 navy team reached the island by midday wednesday , navy geologist @entity54 told the country 's @entity57			1
he said the mass was about 60 feet ( 18 meters ) high , 100 feet ( 30 meters ) long and 250 feet ( 76 meters ) wide			0
' there are stones and mud , ' he said , warning residents not to try to visit the island			1
' gasses are still emitting			0
' dead fish floated on the water 's surface while local residents were visiting the island and taking stones as souvenirs , he added			1
@entity75 , principal seismologist for the @entity76 , said such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano			1
' when such a strong earthquake builds pressure , there is the likelihood of such islands emerging , ' he said			0
' that big shock beneath the earth causes a lot of disturbance			0
' this liquefaction of sand layers takes place after any earthquake , but these sudden islands are usually only spotted after strong earthquakes , at least 7 - or 8 - magnitude events			2
@entity75 , principal seismologist for the @entity76 , said such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano to get a better idea of what the island is made of and how permanent it is , scientists will have to get samples of the material to see if it 's mostly soft mud or rocks and harder material scientists believe the 7.8 magnitude earthquake , which struck 145 miles southeast of @entity17 in @entity20 , triggered what is known as ' mud volcano '			1
they occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder , denser rock and a path is made to the surface			0
the seismic waves caused a movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface along with gas			1
these sudden islands are usually only spotted after strong earthquakes , at least 7 - or 8 - magnitude events			0
@entity137 a seismologist at the @entity139 said that these mud volcanoes are relatively common in this area on both land and at sea			2
‘ they occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder , denser rock and a path is made to the surface , ’ he told @entity144			0
‘ there is a subducting plate boundary in this region where the @entity31 plate is converging on the @entity156 plate at about 2cm a year and being pushed beneath it			0
‘ this is the same plate boundary responsible for the magnitude 7.7 earthquake			0
’ scientists believe gases associated with the melting at the plate boundary contribute to heating the mud in the reservoirs and making it more fluid			2
‘ certainly mud volcanoes are most common near this type of plate boundary , such as in @entity171 , ’ said dr @entity137			0
‘ it is known that mud volcanoes can be triggered by large nearby earthquakes – in fact the same thing happened in this area in 2001			2
‘ the exact mechanism for this triggering is poorly understood but the fact that mud volcanoes often occur without a triggering earthquake suggests that little extra impetus is required			2
’ to get a better idea of what the island is made of and how permanent it is , scientists will have to get samples of the material to see if it 's mostly soft mud or rocks and harder material			1
these types of islands can remain for a long time or eventually subside back into the ocean , depending on their makeup			0
the 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of @entity17 in @entity3 's quake - prone province of @entity20 , which borders @entity21 , on tuesday dozens of people had already visited the island , said the deputy commissioner of @entity30 district , @entity203 , who travelled by boat himself to the island this morning such land masses have appeared before off @entity3 's @entity208 , said @entity209 , a hydrographer with the navy			1
after quakes in 1999 and 2010 , new land masses rose up along a different part of the coast about 282 kilometers ( 175 miles ) east of @entity30 , he said			1
he said each of those disappeared back into the sea within a year during the monsoon season , a period of heavy rain and wind that sweeps @entity3 every summer			1
he said that in the area where the island was created on tuesday , the sea is only about six to seven meters ( 23 feet ) deep			2
older residents of the coastal town recalled an earthquake in 1968 produced an island that stayed for one year and then vanished .			2

people have been warned to avoid the island as gases are still emitting
the mountain - like island appeared 600m off @entity3 's @entity30 coast
the earthquake triggered a movement of gases in the earth under the sea
this pushed earth up to the surface in something akin to a ' mud volcano '
