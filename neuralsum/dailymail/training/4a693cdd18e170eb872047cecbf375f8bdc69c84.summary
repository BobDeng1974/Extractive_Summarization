fashion designers like to make bold and shocking statements with their work , but one designer has taken the aim little more literally			0
@entity6 artist @entity5 created a dress made from metal and used it to conduct electricity from two giant @entity11 coils			1
made entirely from chainmail , ms @entity5 wore the dress on stage and conducted almost half a million volts as she stood between the coils			2
it consists of a spiked helmet and plate - metal dress secured in a head - to - toe suit of chain mail the dress was created by @entity6 designer @entity19 in partnership with band @entity22 , which makes music using @entity11 coils			1

a @entity11 coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit that produces high - voltage , low - current , high frequency alternating current electricity			1
when ms @entity5 stood between the coils , the metal in the dress conducted this energy			1
the chainmail acted like a @entity48 cage , to push the charge to the floor , which protected her from the electricity			0
the dress consists of a spiked helmet and plate - metal dress secured underneath 600 metal rings			1
it was created in partnership with band @entity22 , which makes music using @entity11 coils			2
a @entity11 coil is an electrical resonant circuit that produces high - voltage , low - current , high frequency electricity			1
it features two main sets of windings - a primary , input , and a secondary output			0
each is made up of a capacitor and an inductor , so they become resonant circuits when voltage is passed through the coils			0
the primary winding pushes the voltage through to the second winding , via a spark gap , and this creates the bolt of energy			0

the primary winding pushes the voltage through to the second winding , via a spark gap , and this creates the bolt of energy when ms @entity5 stood between the coils on stage , the metal in the chainmail dress ( pictured ) conducted this energy and pushed it towards the @entity100 worked as a @entity48 cage - which uses its mesh - like structure to move electrostatic charges and pass them around the outside of the ' cage ' when ms @entity5 stood between the coils on stage , the metal in the chainmail dress conducted this energy and pushed it towards the ground			1
the chainmail worked as a @entity48 cage - which uses its mesh - like structure to move electrostatic charges and pass them around the outside of the ' cage '			0
this allowed ms @entity5 to engage with the arcs in person , while being protected beneath			0
ms @entity5 ( pictured testing the dress ) said electricity travels the shortest path to grounds , so basically the dress functioned to lead the electricity directly to floor instead of raising through her body			2
she added the challenge was to create an iconic design that would hold up to the power of high - voltage electricity the project was demonstrated on stage during the @entity131 2014 in @entity132			2
ms @entity5 said : ‘ the problem arose when we could not find a model , and i had to sacrifice my own body for science by standing in between the coils ' ( pictured ) a @entity83 ( pictured ) is an electrical resonant circuit that produces high - voltage , low - current , high frequency electricity the project was demonstrated on stage during the @entity131 2014 in @entity132			1
‘ we both are obsessed by pushing boundaries regarding technology , experimentation , and innovation so that made a good spin - off , ’ ms @entity5 told @entity144			2
‘ we do n't only want to show off a cool project - we also want to educate the viewers by sharing our process to engage and inspire them in the technological facets			0
‘ wearing the dress i was standing in between two giant @entity11 coils that each level up to half a million volt of raw electricity			2
‘ electricity travels the shortest path to grounds , so basically the dress functioned to lead the electricity directly to floor instead of raising through my body			0
ms @entity5 said the challenge was to create an iconic design that would hold up to the power of high - voltage , low - current , high - frequency , alternating - current electricity			1
‘ since we are all experts in what we do , it was no problem to create a dress like this - me as fashion tech designer playing with the boundaries of technology , and @entity22 as leading inventors of these kind of circuits			0

the dress was created by @entity6 designer @entity19
it consists of a spiked helmet and plate - metal dress secured in chain mail
ms @entity5 teamed up with @entity22 , which makes music with @entity11 coils
a @entity11 coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit
it produces high - voltage , low - current , high frequency alternating currents
ms @entity5 then stood between the coils and conducted the electricity
