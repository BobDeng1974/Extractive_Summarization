almost 12 years and 122 tests have passed since @entity1 made his @entity3 debut in @entity4 but the hooker still relishes the fiery reception			1
the battle - hardened front - row has learned to blank out any crude remarks and , with a 100 per cent win rate over @entity10 , has a habit of silencing the sledgers			1
@entity3 ’s unbeaten run stands at 25 games and @entity1 will set out to extend that record on saturday , when he returns to the ground where he first played in 2002 alongside @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
‘ i ’ve got amazing memories from that day , ’ said @entity1 , 35			2
@entity1 warms up alongside head coach @entity21 as @entity3 prepare for @entity10 @entity1 tackles @entity10 ' @entity22 during his debut at the @entity24 in 2002 ‘ being able to hear the @entity25 inside the closed stadium was something i had never experienced before			1
you can hear vividly what they ’re saying			0
it ’s not just advice on throwing the ball in ; i ’ve had some comments about my mother , too			0
‘ you ’ve just got to stay cool			0
there ’s no time to tell them to sort it out			0
being in a closed stadium you can feel the energy			1
there ’s nowhere for the sound to escape and it ’s bouncing off each wall			0
’ a noisy home crowd will be hoping to inspire @entity10 to an unlikely victory at the @entity24			2
but the odds are stacked against @entity50 ’s side , with @entity3 plotting to end their season with a resounding scoreline before the squad take a long break			2
the @entity3 hooker says he has to ignore the shouts from the crowd , which are not always complimentary the 35 - year - old has won every time he has faced @entity10 , and will want that to continue this weekend head coach @entity21 is expected to name a fully loaded starting xv for the @entity62 in @entity4 , having rested some first - choice players for the narrow victory over @entity65 , who frustrated the tourists at the contact area			1
‘ that ’s a constant work - on area , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ it ’s something we want to keep improving because it ’s a vital part of our game			0
if we can nail it then it really sets us up			0
