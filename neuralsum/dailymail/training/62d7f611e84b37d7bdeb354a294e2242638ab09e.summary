by @entity0 a couple who let their toddler urinate in the middle of a busy @entity6 street have sparked a huge debate about acceptable standards of behaviour in @entity11 society			1
the woman was filmed holding a nappy under her two - year - old daughter as she relieved herself in the middle of @entity16 , one of the world ’s busiest shopping districts , last tuesday			1
a row quickly erupted after the toddler ’s parents tried to make off with the memory card from the camera of a young man who filmed the incident			2
much of the furore centres around the perceived gap between standards of social behaviour in mainland @entity11 and on the former @entity43 colony of @entity6			1
it is illegal to let a child relieve themselves in the street in @entity6 and doing so can result in a hk $ 2000 fine			1
however , the practice is relatively common in mainland @entity11			0
the incident in @entity16 last week occurred because there was a long line for a public toilet and the child could not wait , according to the @entity54			0
onlookers surrounded the family to take pictures and then blocked their path as they tried to flee with the child and the pram			0
the @entity11 couple got into a physical altercation as they tried to take the memory card from the camera of the young man taking photos of their daughter ‘ the child was going to pee in her pants , what do you want me do ? ’ the mother can be heard telling onlookers in the video			1
she was arrested for allegedly slapping one of the locals across the face and ramming another with the pram			0
the row came to light after a @entity6 reporter , @entity82 , posted the details on her blog			2
an anonymous user of @entity11 ’s popular online forum , @entity87 , has now escalated tensions by calling on mainland parents to bring their children to @entity6 this week and let them urinate in the streets in protest			1
‘ bring children to @entity6 and let them urinate in @entity6 ’s streets			2
let ’s see who will come and take photos			0
they will see it as natural after they have been familiarised with the act , ’ user @entity93 posted , according to the @entity95			0
since being posted online , the video and images of the toddler has drawn more than one million comments on @entity37 social media alone			1
‘ why do n't the couple let the child wear the diaper as a precaution in the first place ? ’ @entity113 posted on @entity37			0
‘ they could talk to the people in the line to let them use the bathroom first or let the child pee inside the bathroom instead of on the street			0
’ but @entity11 citizens weighing in on the debate have hit back at the treatment of the couple and child			2
‘ the man had no right to take pictures of a little girl peeing and violate her privacy , ’ @entity37 user youyouyu wrote			0
