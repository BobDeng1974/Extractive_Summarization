by @entity0 @entity1 , guitarist from @entity3 band @entity2 , is campaigning for drugs sniffer dogs to be banned from music festivals because he claims they cause panic induced overdoses			1
@entity1 argues the @entity10 government need to stop ‘ taking their marching orders from police ’ to make sure the health and well being of festival goers is the priority			1
he said : ‘ we need to step back from the legal situation and prioritise health			0
we need non-politicians and people , maybe like me , to think of solutions that are n’t about force , rules and restrictions			0
' we ’re a nation descended from convicts , we ’re going to break the rules ! ' @entity1 of @entity2 performs on stage			1
he 's campaigning for new strategies to prevent the dangerous ' panic - induced overdoses ' he says are caused by drug detection dogs			1
@entity2 guitarist @entity1 , pictured ( left ) , hopes new strategies can decrease the number of festival goers hospitalised due to drug use			1
@entity1 argues that less forceful solutions would be more effective			1
' the problem with the @entity10 government is that they ’re taking their marching orders from the police , much like the lock out laws			2
that results in solutions that are about violence and power			0
ask police how to fix the problem and they will naturally say ‘ more tasers , more restrictions , more dogs ’ to try and get more power to do what they do best			2
' on monday , @entity1 posted an open letter on @entity54 to almost 90,000 followers , hoping to take action to ‘ reduce dangerous drug taking practices ’ , arguing that the use of sniffer dogs contributes to the misuse of drugs at music festivals			1
in the letter , @entity1 asks to trial a ban on drug detection dogs from this year ’s @entity68 music festival at @entity69 , in @entity70			1
he hopes the decision will potentially decrease the number of people hospitalised for drug use			0
@entity1 argues that sniffer dogs cause the potentially fatal ‘ panic - induced overdose			1
’ in 2009 , 17 - year - old @entity77 died at the music festival @entity78 in @entity79 of a drug overdose			0
according to her friend , she swallowed ecstasy tablets out of ' fear ' of being detected by sniffer dogs			1
@entity1 says that the use of sniffer dogs by police is n’t just ineffective ; it ’s also harmful			1
‘ we should n’t be creating fear and risking lives , trying to stop behaviour that simply will not stop			0
sniffer dogs do n’t stop people doing drugs at the festival ground			1
if the concern is to prevent drug taking , why not look into the use of drug testing stations , like in @entity100 ? ” @entity1 's open letter was addressed to @entity102 , the local minister for @entity103 in @entity70 , the region where @entity68 will take place next week from from july to 27			1
today , mr @entity102 confirmed he received the letter on july 2 of this year , and that he has approached the federal government with the proposal			2
@entity1 is arguing that police drug detection dogs are ineffective and harmful at music festivals , responsible for ' panic - induced overdoses ' ' i passed on his request to the @entity113 respectively for their consideration and response			1
i have no response from either minister at this stage			0
' the @entity122 ’s national policy manager , @entity120 supports @entity1 ’s argument that there are risks with using sniffer dogs			1
' sniffer dogs , while they may be a deterrent for some people who might carry drugs into an event have the potential to scare people and may make them panic			1
' reports on high hospitalisations from people swallowing their drugs to avoid detection concern us greatly			0
' mr @entity120 is backing the proposed trial , to make safety at festivals the main concern			2
he says : “ we would support police and festival organisers using other measures to keep festival goers safe and healthy during the event … ' @entity151 knows the reality is that many people take drugs at musical festivals , so we need to work together to make sure people come home safely			2
' @entity2 is due to perform at next week ’s annual @entity157 for the fifth time			2
he speaks frankly about his observations of the drug culture and music festivals			2
' at this point , it ’s clear that people are going to do drugs at festivals no matter what , so we have to do everything we can to keep them safe			2
people at the @entity173 in the @entity175 music festival at @entity69			0
a crowd watching a performance at the @entity173 in the @entity175 music festival			0
@entity1 suggests a sniffer dog ban be trialled at the festival , taking place next week			1
' we need to step back from the legal situation and prioritise health			0
we need to value people ’s lives more than we are			0
' mr @entity1 says drug use has become an inevitable part of music festival culture			2
‘ i ’m not apologising for drug use , but the reality is drugs have become an ingrained part of the festival culture			0
' the more police crack down , the more festivals are affected			0
an example of that is how @entity78 ’s going under and we ’re starting to see more underground festivals			0
' @entity1 says people need to be more proactive than just ‘ liking ’ the post on @entity54			1
@entity1 urges @entity3 to take the debate away from the screen and contact members of government			1
' a proper democracy is about having a debate			0
today i found people have liked my letter , but then go off and forget about it			0
' that does n’t do much , that 's not the point			0
democracy only works when constituents are constantly in touch with their local members , but people have a rant on @entity54 or call up talkback radio and that satisfies them			2
' @entity1 hopes that new strategies will be considered to potentially create a safer environment at music festivals			2
' what i want is to open up logical debate , so based on evidence we can work out the safest option			0
having a trial will at least give us some numbers to work with			0
' some say removing sniffer dogs from festivals will make people take more drugs			1
i 'm not sure , but if it results in less hospitalisations then it 's a positive thing			0
