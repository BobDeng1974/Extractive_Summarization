a team of diggers has started removing 2,500 tonnes of waste from a 40ft - high rat - infested rubbish pile which has blighted the lives of residents for the past three years			1
the towering mountain of putrid rubbish sits at the end of @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity12 , and is laden with everything imaginable - from rotting industrial waste , old shoes and broken fridges to tyres , scrap metal , excrement , discarded nappies and plastic bottles			1
the stinking mound - which residents say ' smells like rotting corpses ' - is also prone to catching fire , as ' hot spots ' smoulder deep inside the 60 - ft wide pile of rubbish			1
fire crews have now been called to 23 fires at the site - one of which lasted ten days - which has cost the taxpayer £ 650,000			1
now , experts from the @entity40 are starting to remove some of the waste the @entity40 , which has been locked in a @entity43 legal battle with @entity44 , which runs the site , has called in experts to remove 2,500 tonnes of rubbish from the 20,000 tonne pile the towering mountain , which sits at the end of @entity10 , is laden with everything imaginable - from rotting industrial waste , old shoes and broken fridges to tyres , scrap metal , excrement , discarded nappies and plastic bottles now the @entity40 - which is locked in a @entity43 legal battle with @entity44 , which runs the site - has ordered experts to remove some of the mess so the pile is at a ' safe ' level and stops spontaneously catching fire			1
but fed - up locals in @entity66 , @entity67 , say the action is not enough - and have called for the entire 20,000 - tonne mountain to be removed			2
@entity70 , 60 , a grandmother - of - two , said : ' it is a plague			2
it is a living nightmare			0
it is really , really horrible			0
you ca n't open your doors or your windows			0
the smell that comes through is like rotting corpses			1
' you ca n't go out , it is in your clothes , in your hair , because the smell gets in them			0
you ca n't use your garden			0
many residents have sore throats and coughs			0
anybody who has a breathing problem suffers greatly			0
' ms @entity70 said residents had been campaigning to clear the site for three years and accused the @entity40 of allowing the mound to spiral out of control by failing to take swift action			2
she said she feared the frequent fires were belching toxic fumes which could be endangering the health of her two young grandchildren , whom she looks after during the day			0
she said : ' if the @entity40 had taken action when we wanted them to two and a half years ago it would be half the size			2
we feel very , very let down			0
' the mountain of garbage has been a problem for residents since rubbish disposal company @entity44 took over the site in 2011			1
fire crews have been called to 23 fires at the site , mostly during the hot summer weather , costing the taxpayer £ 650,000 and taking up 2,000 hours of firefighters ' time but residents say efforts by the @entity40 to remove some of the waste - which includes rotting industrial waste , tyres , scrap metal and even excrement - is too little too late			1
they are campaigning for the entire tip to be removed according to its website , the firm ’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it ‘ specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity			2
’ it charges people to dump rubbish at the site during the day and the night , which it then sorts , treats and sends on for disposal elsewhere			2
but residents say this practice does not happen and instead , over the past couple of years , @entity44 has simply taken the money and let it stack up into a monstrous pile			2
resident @entity149 , 34 , a mother - of - two , said : ' the smell , especially when it 's hot , is repugnant , disgusting			0
it makes you feel sick to the stomach			0
it 's like living next to a sewage works			0
' we have a real rat problem			0
the size of the rats are massive - up to 2ft with their tails			0
i have a three - year - old son and five - year - old daughter and it makes me fear for their health			0
my son has eczema and it is not good for him			0
' diggers working on the site is the first sign of any tangible action being taken to free the residents of the rat - infested rubbish mound , which regularly catches fire @entity44 uses the site as a waste transfer site where it ' processes general non-hazardous waste '			1
it is allowed a maximum of 5,500 tonnes on the site at a time - but has almost four times that amount she said local schools do not allow children out in the playground at break when the rubbish pile is on fire because of health fears			1
she added that residents fear the pile will one day cause a fire that gets out of control and spreads			2
she said : ' about 18 months ago there was a fire that lasted 10 days and that was pretty scary			0
if the wind was blowing the other way it could have taken the whole street out			0
' ms @entity149 also blamed the unsightly ' scourge ' for sending house prices in the street down , saying house prices had plummeted by £ 100,000			2
the location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority , which in this case is @entity215			0
but its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the @entity40 , which allows @entity44 to use the site ‘ as a waste transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste , from commercial operators with [ a maximum ] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time			1
’ the pile is often seen emitting steam , as rubbish smoulders deep inside the mound , pictured left			2
it is that which has forced the @entity40 to send in workers , pictured right , in a bid to take the mound to a ' safe ' level the height and width of the giant mound mean most residents can see the rubbish pile from their window			1
resident @entity149 , 34 , said the smell is ' repugnant , disgusting ' and it is ' like living next to a sewage works ' the @entity40 is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm , claiming it has not been paying for the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere			1
last november , the agency won a court order for @entity44 to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of april			1
but the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week			1
it ended up failing to comply with the order			0
the @entity40 then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company , former company director @entity266 , new company director @entity267 and site manager @entity268			2
the charges were in relation to @entity44 not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site			1
resident @entity70 , 60 , said she can not open her doors or windows because the smell comes through like ' rotting corpses '			1
she said the smell even gets in her hair and on her clothes when she steps outside steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away , creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents but , in july this year , the @entity43 dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal			1
talking about the team of diggers , the @entity40 said : ' @entity40 contractors have entered the @entity44 site in @entity11 in an operation to lower the illegal waste pile to a safe level			1
' @entity40 's battle to ensure that the site operator and landowner clean up the site is continuing , but is taking this rare step to reduce the blight on the local community			1
' @entity308 , environment manager at the @entity40 , said : ' we understand the frustration of local residents and we will continue our fight against @entity44			1
' it is not right that taxpayers should pick up the bill for this operation when it remains the responsibility of the site operator and landowners , but the priority is to make the site as safe as possible			0
' we are committed to working with our partners , including the @entity322 of @entity323 , to find a long - term solution			0

the 40ft tip , which is also 60ft wide , has 20,000 tonnes of rubbish which towers above street near @entity11 , @entity12

@entity40 , which is locked in @entity43 battle with site managers @entity44 , is clearing 2,500 tonnes
