the website set up to defend convicted rapist @entity1 has been referred to the police over a complaint by his victim 's father that the footballer 's supporters have identified her			1
the attorney general @entity8 has also asked @entity9 to look into whether evidence served during @entity1 ' trial in 2012 has been dealt with ' properly '			1
in @entity13 all sex attack victims are granted anonymity and it is a criminal offence to name them			0
but the woman raped by @entity1 has been forced to change her name and move for a fifth time after being hunted down by vile internet trolls			1
new twist : a website set up to support @entity1 , pictured with his fiancée @entity22 , will be investigated by police and prosecutors after a complaint it helps identify his victim @entity29 was released from prison last year after serving two - and - a - half years for the rape of a 19 - year - old woman in a hotel , but continues to protest his innocence			1
much of his defence is contained on his website , but there are claims that some of its content is in contempt of court			2
a spokeswoman for the attorney general said : ' the attorney general , @entity8 mp , has asked the @entity46 to consider whether any criminal offences may have been committed in regards to identifying the victim in the @entity1 case			1
' he has also asked the @entity52 police to investigate whether some of the material served during the course of the proceedings has been dealt with properly			1
' if not , this may constitute a contempt of court			0
' given that there is now the possibility of proceedings being brought , it is very important that there is no comment in the media which might jeopardise either the investigation or any subsequent proceedings			0
since @entity1 ’ conviction , his victim , who has a legal right to anonymity for life , has moved home five times as online trolls repeatedly tracked her down and revealed her new identity			1
she was first given a new identity in 2012 when her name was circulated on social media at the end of the court case			0
nine people were later each ordered by court to pay the victim £ 624 in one of the first cases of its kind			2
a number of football clubs were confronted with public outcry after showing interest in the @entity93 and @entity95 player as he attempted to restart his career			0
the former striker was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in @entity93 in 2011 after a deal with @entity103 collapsed earlier this month following a public petition , he released a statement condemning the online abuse of his victim			2
the 26 - year - old , who is still on licence , said : “ whilst i continue to maintain my innocence , i wish to make it clear that i wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in @entity112 has had on many people , not least the woman concerned			0
“ finally , it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine			0
i wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and i condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so			0
” @entity1 ’s supporters have mounted a vigorous campaign to overturn his conviction , including setting up a website detailing what they say are the flaws in the case against him			1
the appeal against @entity1 ’s conviction was rejected by three judges at the @entity137 in 2012 and the case is currently being considered by the @entity139 .			2
