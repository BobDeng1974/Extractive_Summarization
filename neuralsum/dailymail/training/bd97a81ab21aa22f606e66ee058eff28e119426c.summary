by @entity0 after @entity4 mother - of - three and certified lactation consultant @entity2 posted photos of herself breastfeeding on @entity6 , she was outraged when the page she used to support other mothers was suspended			1
the milk meg facebook page was closed for at least 24 hours last year prompting ms @entity2 , of the @entity10 , to coin the term lactaboobiephobia ; a fear of women breastfeeding			1
' one photo was reported and just the photo was taken down			0
when a second photo was reported the page was temporarily suspended , ' the @entity17 - born 32 - year - old told @entity16			1
while mrs @entity29 said she believes @entity6 's polices have since changed to allow images of breastfeeding , she was outraged at that time			1
' when that happened i was so frustrated by that			0
i was just thinking about this whole thing and how people have an issue with it , this fear of breastfeeding			1
' the term just popped into my head , because of my psychology background , and i took a liking to it			0
' using her professional blog about breastfeeding , mrs @entity2 wrote a post about the experience in march last year and believes she was the first person in the world to coin the term after a @entity54 search at the time found nothing			1
after posting images of herself breastfeeding on @entity6 more than a year ago , the page was suspended for about 24 hours ' i purposely searched online to make sure it was n't anywhere and at the time it was n't out there at all			1
' since then a documentary filmmaker has approached her to work on a 10 - minute piece about the incident and her blog response			2
filmed earlier this year , the documentary will be released online later this year			2
in the past mrs @entity2 said she has experienced lactaboobiephobia , including when a man asked her to breastfeed in a toilet			1
the incident happened a few years ago while she was breastfeeding her second son in the @entity17 ' i was sitting in a cafe in @entity17 , but it happens in @entity76 too , ' she said			2
' a man said : " you know there 's a toilet down the hall " , and then he said it again			0
the 32 - year - old coined the term lactaboobiephobia around a fear of women breastfeeding , following the @entity6 incident ' i asked : " if i was feeding my baby with a bottle that would be ok ? " and he said : " yes that would be fine "			1
it was a horrible experience but you get that in life			0
' with nothing more to say , mrs @entity2 left the cafe			2
' you hear about it in the media all the time			0
most people do n't even think twice when they see a woman breastfeeding , but on the odd occasion it does happen			0
mrs @entity2 said after the birth of her first son , who is now 11 , she had a lot of support with breastfeeding			1
but it was not until the birth of her third son two years ago that she decided to make a career out of support other women with breastfeeding			2
studying nursing at the time and having already been a volunteer breastfeeding councillor for seven years , the move was a natural fit and also allowed her to draw on her previous psychology studies			2
the 32 - year - old said she had experienced lactaboobiephobia when a man at a cafe asked her to breastfeed in a toilet mrs @entity2 said the demand for lactation consultants was growing and that @entity76 and the @entity17 have the largest numbers of consultants			1
' i think it 's really difficult with breastfeeding because there is so much information out there , ' she said			2
' sometimes women do n't get support in hospital or if they do , they do n't get the support when they get home			0
' i come from the philosophy of testing you own instincts as a mother and following the lead of the baby ... i give women as many different suggestions as i can			0
' she said there was no black and white approach to breastfeeding			0
mrs @entity2 , pictured with two of her three sons , said there was no black and white approach to breastfeeding ' women will find some things work better than others			1
different women will experience different things - its about listening to instincts			0
' finding that support that really is in line with their own parent philosophy is important			0
following the lead of the baby without strict schedules and encouraging women to choose what feels right for them from a range of options are the basis of mrs @entity2 's approach to breastfeeding			1
she added that in western cultures , there was often a lack of support around breastfeeding as part of the shift away from community living			0
she has used social media and her blog to build a community of mothers , with nearly 15,000 likes on her @entity6			2
' i 've built a big community of mums who feel like my philosophies are something they relate to , ' she said			0
as part of her work as a lactation consultant , mrs @entity2 has used social media and a blog to connect with breastfeeding mothers ' @entity6 is amazing for mums to share information and get support - it 's about mums helping each other			1
still breastfeeding her youngest son , two , mrs @entity2 said it made it even easier for other breastfeeding mothers to relate to her			1
' i think it 's really important for me as a mum to be sharing my own experiences , ' she said			0
' it 's really helpful to share stories and my own breastfeeding experiences			2
' thanks to her work with breastfeeding mothers , mrs @entity2 has been nominated for the 2014 @entity220 in the blog and emerging @entity223 categories			1
' it 's great i get really supportive feedback from mums , ' she said			0
' i get lots of good feedback on @entity6			0
