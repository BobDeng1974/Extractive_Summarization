@entity0 @entity1 will benefit greatly from being pruned in late summer — and certainly again this month			1
in august , you should have removed all the long , wispy summer growths , cutting each back to a stump with seven leaves along the length			1
it helps even more if you now shorten those stumps further , to about three buds			2
while summer pruning stimulates flower production , this month 's cuts will enhance bloom quality			1
if you did n't prune your wisteria last summer , do n't despair			1
you should still enjoy plenty of spring blossom and the plant 's health will not be compromised			2
but pruning makes these rampant climbers far easier to manage and also helps develop a handsome gnarled appearance			1
twice - yearly pruning also encourages the plant to develop more spurs — the short growths that carry most of the blossom			1
@entity30 ( pictured ) is a fungal disease affecting leaves and flower stems @entity35 's question we planted a @entity38 rose last year and enjoyed the flowers for months			1
but now the leaves have large black spots and there are n't many flowers			2
is there a cure ? mrs @entity46 , @entity47			0
@entity48 marks on leaves and flower stems are caused by fungal disease @entity30			1
prevent its spread by removing all affected leaves and stems as soon as any spots appear			0
treatment with a fungicide such as @entity58 is worth a try — though it is not specifically recommended by suppliers			0
check winter containers make sure outdoor containers are draining properly and the drainage holes are not plugged up by soil ensure outdoor containers are draining as they should			1
modern potting composts tend to compact as they decompose in the winter and that reduces their ability to let water drain away			1
ants can also can block drainage holes by carrying soil particles into the bottom of the containers over time			1
this sets like clay , creating a plug			0
if drainage holes are blocked plants suffer root damage and can die			0
so , if you are able , lift each container to make sure there are no obstructions			2
large tubs are difficult to inspect but you do need to make sure they drain properly			1
you can stand large containers on little ' feet ' to raise them a centimetre or so above the ground			2
this helps to prevent the holes clogging			0
you can buy manufactured ' feet ' for big pots , but i find pieces of broken tile work almost as well and cost nothing			0
@entity100 now is the time to take care of your @entity103 ( pictured ) water the pot regularly and feed weekly if you were given an amaryllis for @entity38 , it will need some attention now			1
these bulbs , more correctly called @entity111 , are among @entity113 's most popular winter houseplants			0
but most people dump them when their huge blooms have died			0
that 's a shame because they 're easy to bring into flower year after year			1
to do this , water the pot regularly while the flowers are alive and feed once a week as soon as leaves appear with a houseplant fertiliser such as @entity126			1
allow the handsome , straplike leaves to develop and keep the plants in a conservatory , frost - free greenhouse or near a window			0
they can spend summer outside , in full sun. continue to feed while the leaves still grow			1
in july , stop watering , let the leaves wither and dry before cutting off			0
water again from september and bring the plant back indoors before the first frost			2
the silk tassel bush , @entity139 ( pictured ) , originates from the @entity140 plant of the week the silk tassel bush , @entity139 , which originates from the western coastal regions of the @entity140 , is one of the great joys of winter			2
its evergreen leaves are quietly pretty with gently wavy edges			0
these make a perfect foil for the pale green catkins , which are wonderfully long and hang plumb - line straight			2
long catkins appear only on male plants — the females have more stumpy fruits			0
and it 's worth selecting a named clone such as @entity158 or the more wavy - leaved @entity159			0
@entity160 is hardy in much of @entity113 , but will suffer in excessively cold regions			0
it can be wall - trained , for extra protection , and needs to grow in a sunny position to produce good catkins .			0

pruning in the summer stimulates flower production but cuts at this time of year will enhance bloom quality
@entity1 benefit from a late summer pruning and again in *january*
make sure outdoor containers are draining properly and *effectively*
water your @entity103 regularly and be sure to feed it once a week
