in an interview on @entity24 's @entity25 , sir @entity1 said working opposite @entity26 on film @entity3 left a lasting impression on him			1
he also said the project , about @entity30 opera singer @entity29 , kindled his love for the musical style , particularly @entity34 and @entity35			0
he said : ' i was very fortunate enough to make a film with @entity2 in which she played @entity29 , an @entity30 operatic star who developed poliomyelitis , and i played her brother @entity39 and we had wonderful excerpts from all the operas and liking and having a great affection for music , music of any sort except for ' yeah , yeah , yeah ' , i had a wonderful time on the whole			2
' i 'm often asked ' who has you worked with who you really thought was great ? ' and i think @entity2 was the first and one of the only who was a really accomplished actress , a really caring actress , who was most unselfish and i was secretly in love with her			2
of course , she was married to a wonderful painter and i was married elsewhere			0
' miss @entity2 , best known for her role as the @entity57 in @entity58 , was five year 's sir @entity1 's senior at 33 and married to @entity60 portrait painter @entity59 , the third of her four husbands			1

the @entity5 star 87 , pictured with his fourth wife @entity89 , never told @entity26 how he felt the radio programme is based around celebrities choosing their favourite pieces of classical music and , picking the slow movement of @entity100 's piano concerto number 20 in d minor , sir @entity1 , a father of three , explained : ' it 's one of our bedtime tunes , i have it on my @entity107 and about ten minutes before we 're due to sleep , we close the books and i put the music on			1
' my wife studied ballet and she does a little dance and i get up and i try to dance , i try to move my old arthritic knees			0
we have a little music and then the light goes off , it 's one of our bedtime tunes			0
' while a love of classical music has been a thread running through much of the actor 's life , one of his biggest regrets is giving up on his desire to play the violin , which he began lessons at a young age			2
after picking the opening of @entity132 's violin concerto in @entity133 as one of his pieces because of his ' real passion for strings ' , he said : ' i am privileged to be at the right end of violins , not the end holding it but to listen to it			0
when i was eight , an uncle , great uncle , gave a violin to me and my father took me off to have lessons			0
