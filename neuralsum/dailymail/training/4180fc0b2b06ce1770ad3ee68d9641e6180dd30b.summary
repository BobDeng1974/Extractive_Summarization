the spy chief : @entity2 director - general @entity1 has blasted the @entity4 's publication of @entity6 's espionage capabilities a massive cache of stolen top - secret documents published in @entity4 has handed a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists , the head of @entity2 warned last night			1
in a blistering attack , @entity1 said the publication of confidential files leaked by @entity16 fugitive @entity15 had caused huge ‘ harm ’ to the capability of @entity6 ’s intelligence services			1
security officials say the exposé amounts to a ‘ guide book ’ , advising terrorists on the best way to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity			1
in @entity28 , it is considered to have caused the greatest damage to the @entity31 security apparatus in history			0
in his first public speech since taking the job earlier this year , mr @entity1 said the leaks handed the ‘ advantage ’ to terrorists and were a ‘ gift they need to evade us and strike at will ’			1
he said there were several thousand @entity43 extremists living in the @entity6 who ‘ see the @entity6 people as a legitimate target ’			1
the security services were working round the clock to stop the fanatics , but @entity2 was now ‘ tackling threats on more fronts than ever before ’			1
@entity15 , a former contractor for the @entity51 , fled the @entity16 in may with thousands of classified documents about the @entity51 and @entity53 , which he gave to @entity4			1
the newspaper has since published tens of thousands of words on the secret techniques used by @entity53 to monitor emails , phone records and communications on the internet			1
the first @entity4 revelations came in early june , when it detailed how the @entity51 – which supplies intelligence to @entity53 , the organisation which gathers intelligence for @entity2 and @entity65 – had ‘ direct access ’ to the computer systems of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
the newspaper also revealed how @entity53 has access to a network of cables carrying international phone calls and internet traffic and is processing vast amounts of ‘ personal information ’			1
by the time his identity as the source of the leaks emerged , @entity15 had fled his home in @entity89 for @entity90			0
after a week in hiding , he travelled to @entity91 , where he remains out of the reach of @entity16 authorities			0
the editor and the leaker : the @entity4 's @entity96 and former @entity51 employee @entity15 in august , police detained @entity98 , the partner of @entity4 journalist @entity99 , for nine hours at @entity100			1
mr @entity98 had been carrying intelligence files leaked by @entity15			0
at the time it emerged @entity103 had authorised the destruction of computers at @entity4 offices			1
security concerns were so acute that mr @entity103 sent cabinet secretary sir @entity108 to demand that @entity4 editor @entity96 destroy the files after warning they could fall into the hands of terrorists			1
members of @entity53 supervised the smashing of laptops and hard drives at the newspaper ’s offices			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ what we know about the terrorists , and the detail of the capabilities we use against them , together represent our margin of advantage			1
that margin gives us the prospect of being able to detect their plots and stop them			0
thousands of classified documents about the @entity51 and @entity53 were published by @entity4 @entity132 in @entity133			1
the leak was described as the greatest damage to @entity31 security apparatus in history ‘ but that margin is under attack			0
reporting from @entity53 is vital to the safety of this country and its citizens			2
‘ @entity53 intelligence has played a vital role in stopping many of the terrorist plots that @entity2 and the police have tackled in the past decade			1
‘ it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of @entity53 techniques			1
such information hands the advantage to the terrorists			2
' it is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will			2
unfashionable as it might seem , that is why we must keep secrets secret , and why not doing so causes such harm			2
’ in a wide - ranging speech to the @entity167 think - tank , mr @entity1 said the task of @entity2 was ‘ getting harder ’			1
he pointed to the danger posed by @entity6 nationals returning from fighting in @entity171			2
in august , police detained @entity98 , the partner of @entity4 journalist @entity99 , for nine hours at @entity100			2
mr @entity98 had been carrying intelligence files leaked by @entity15 the spy chief said there is a ' growing proportion of groups and individuals taking it upon themselves to commit acts of terrorism '			0
pictured is the 7/7 @entity133 bombings , which killed 52 civilians mr @entity1 said : ‘ the ability of @entity185 to launch the centrally directed large - scale attacks of the last decade has been degraded , though not removed			1
‘ we have seen the threat shift more to increasing numbers of smaller - scale attacks and a growing proportion of groups and individuals taking it upon themselves to commit acts of terrorism			0
' it remains the case that there are several thousand @entity43 extremists here who see the @entity6 people as a legitimate target			1
overall , i do not believe the terrorist threat is worse now than before			0
but it is more diffuse			0
’ mr @entity1 also warned that , in some quarters , there could be an ‘ alarming degree of complacency ’ that @entity2 and the police could foil all attacks			1
he said : ‘ terrorism , because of its nature and consequences , is the one area of crime where the expectation sometimes seems to be that the stats should be zero			0
imagine applying the same target to murder in general , or major drugs trafficking			0
that is the stuff of “ pre-crime ” in the @entity221 movie , minority report			0
’ @entity2 has attracted criticism for failing to stop individuals – including two of the july 7 bombers – who were on its radar			2
but mr @entity1 , who replaced @entity229 as director - general of the @entity2 earlier this year , said : ‘ with greater resources since 7/7 we have worked very hard to identify as many as possible of the people in the country who are active in some way in support of terrorism			1
‘ the idea that we either can or would want to operate intensive scrutiny of thousands is fanciful			0
this is not @entity241 , or @entity242			0
knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them			0
’ he also made the case for more powers to monitor emails and the internet			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ shifts in technology can erode our capabilities			2
there are choices to be made , including , for example , about how and whether communications data is retained			0
it is not , however , an option to disregard such shifts with an unspoken assumption that somehow security will anyway be sustained			0
we can not work without tools			0
’ a @entity267 spokesman said : ‘ a huge number of people – from president @entity270 to the @entity16 director of national intelligence , @entity272 have now conceded that the @entity15 revelations have prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue			0
‘ the president has even set up a review panel and there have been vigorous discussions in the @entity278 and throughout @entity279			0
such a debate is only worthwhile if it is informed			0
that is what journalism should do			0
’ @entity15 became one of the world ’s most wanted men in early june when he broke cover as the agent who leaked top - secret documents from the @entity51			2
his initial revelations detailed how the @entity51 harvested private information from the computer systems of companies including @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity76 using a secret @entity16 surveillance programme called @entity293			2
the @entity4 then claimed the @entity51 supplied intelligence to @entity53 – accusing agents at the @entity6 ’s listening post of attempting to bypass @entity6 law			1
the @entity6 spy agency compiled 197 intelligence dossiers from the system in a single year , sidestepping the need to obtain a court order			2
on june 18 , the newspaper claimed @entity6 intelligence agents hacked into the communications of politicians and senior officials from @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 during the @entity312 summit in @entity133 in 2009 – prompting a furious backlash ahead of the @entity315 meeting in @entity91			2
@entity15 also revealed how @entity53 was able to hoover up vast amounts of personal information , including websites visited , emails sent and received , text messages , calls and passwords , using a state - of - the - art programme called @entity324			1
the surveillance operation centres on using probes to access a network of fibre - optic cables coming into and out of the country			0
telecoms firms allegedly involved in @entity324 include @entity331 , @entity332 and @entity333			0
the @entity4 then revealed that the @entity51 was providing millions of pounds of funding each year to @entity53 to allow it to trawl for personal data			1
one document leaked by @entity15 and dating from 2010 suggested @entity53 must ‘ pull its weight ’ to meet the @entity51 ’s ‘ minimum expectations ’			2
@entity15 also made the highly damaging revelation that the @entity16 government had hacked computers in mainland @entity343 and @entity90 for years – threatening to consign relations between the super-powers to the deep freeze			0
@entity16 intelligence chiefs responded to the leaks with fury			0
@entity51 director @entity350 told the @entity16 @entity351 the top - secret surveillance programmes had disrupted at least 50 terror plots			2
the @entity354 reported the @entity51 had acted illegally on ‘ thousands ’ of occasions over the harvesting of personal data , and foreign secretary @entity358 was forced to the @entity359 to insist any suggestion the @entity6 intelligence agencies had colluded with the @entity51 to act outside the law was ‘ fantastical ’ .			1

@entity2 chief @entity1 called paper 's expose a ' guide book ' for terrorists
he said the coverage is a gift to ' thousands ' of @entity6 - based extremists
