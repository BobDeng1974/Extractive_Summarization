he may have been judged a significant enough political figure to warrant a federal holiday - but some @entity3 seem not even to know @entity4 is dead			0
a string of pedestrians tracked down on a @entity8 street on martin luther king day monday claimed they had seen seen a speech they were told the civil rights leader gave that morning in @entity14 speaking to a cameraman for @entity16 , seven of fourteen people who were asked whether they saw the supposed speech - despite @entity19 having been assassinated 46 years ago			1
one seemed to keep believing in the bogus speech , even when they were asked their opinion on @entity23 and @entity24 having performed as backing singers during the address			0
a man who gave his name as @entity29 , from @entity30 , @entity8 , bluffed his way through questions about the speech , which he said was ' very inspiring , motivational ' and ' current for today '			2
another young man , who did not give his name but wore a blue cap and grey shirt , said he was ' shocked ' at the appearance - but did not question whether it happened			0
he was given several prompts to remember that there was no way he could have given a speech			0
maybe they were dreaming ? these two men were keen to discuss the speech - which did not actually happen			0
the person on the left suggested @entity19 could do with losing weight , while the man to the right described @entity24 and @entity23 's in the event involvement as ' fabulous ' how it was : pictured above is the famous ' @entity54 ' speech @entity19 gave , in real life , in august 1963 but while he said he was ' shocked ' to supposedly see @entity19 in person at the @entity57 , and admitted he had n't ' heard him talk in a while ' , he never suggested it might be because he is deceased			1
another responded to suggestions and said the @entity3 hero , who had parades processing in his honor that very moment , could do with losing some weight			0
introducing the segment , which aired on @entity68 , a bemused @entity66 said the lack of knowledge on show was ' disturbing '			1
he said that sometimes such videos - where they attempt to fool passers - by into saying something obviously ridiculous - often take the best part of a day to film , but this one took hardly any time			2
memorial : while @entity66 's @entity68 show was filming the embarrassing segment , political leaders were honoring @entity19 's memory			1
pictured above are a collection of politicians in front of the @entity86 in @entity14 on parade : here activists march through the streets of @entity90 , where @entity19 was shot dead in 1968			1

seven people told film crew that they had seen civil rights leader that day
bluffed that they had seen a *fictitious* address he gave in @entity14
did not respond to hints that @entity19 has actually been dead since 1968
@entity66 said it was ' disturbing ' how easy it was to find people for the video
