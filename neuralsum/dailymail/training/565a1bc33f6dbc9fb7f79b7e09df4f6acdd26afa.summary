it was part @entity1 , part pantomime dame and shinier than a fresh conker			0
@entity5 of @entity6 opted for a new hairstyle as she met schoolchildren yesterday – and it rather stole the limelight			0
instead of her usual relaxed waves , @entity12 ’s glossy mane was pinned in a half - up , half - down style , back - combed on top , and teased into tight ringlets … to begin with , at least			1
she wore a £ 450 coral dress from @entity28 ringing the changes : @entity12 's tight ringlets ( left ) quickly dropped away in the heat ( right )			1
she was at the north @entity26 school to find out about the progress of a charity progress she launched last year but it seems that even being a member of the royal family does n’t make you immune to the perils of hot weather			2
not long into the visit to the @entity24 in @entity25 , north @entity26 , the heat and humidity caused @entity12 ’s curls to drop rather dramatically			1
the 32 - year - old was left with rather limp locks – still pinned somewhat severely off her forehead			2
@entity12 was at the school to find out about the progress of charity project she launched last year			2
@entity50 provides early support for children affected by a parent ’s drug or alcohol misuse			0
@entity5 wore a £ 450 coral pink dress from @entity28 as she chatted to youngsters in the sunshine – but it was her hairstyle , which could have been a wig from pre-revolutionary , peri-wigged @entity62 , that came in for the most scrutiny			0
the colour of her hair also attracted attention , for it appeared to have been lightened , and some strands looked almost blonde			0
doing the twist : the @entity5 ' ' do from the back			0
yesterday 's curled style was a more theatrical look than the her usual glossy blow - dry , but was thought to have been the work of her regular stylist , @entity73 celebrity hairdresser @entity74 believes this had been done using a gentle tint , rather than conventional bleach highlights , to avoid @entity12 ending up with unsightly roots			1
he said : ‘ subtle lightening like this is achieved with a low peroxide formula			0
‘ the hair is only lightened towards the mid-length and ends , not at the roots , which would prevent root regrowth			0
’ @entity12 used to be a regular at the @entity87 salon in @entity88 , but is now thought to go to @entity91 - based @entity90 stylist @entity89 , who charges £ 1,000 for a haircut			1
princess in pink : @entity12 's hair was pinned back to make sure that it did not fall in her face as she spent time talking to her young flag - wearing fans outside the school			1
her style is also suitably formal for an official visit yesterday ’s curled style was a more theatrical look than the @entity5 ’s usual glossy blow - dry , but was thought to have been the work of her regular stylist , @entity73			1
she is believed to have achieved the style by blow - drying @entity12 ’s hair and then using large curling tongs to create those ringlets			1
the top section of the hair appears to have been back - combed , and then pinned back			1
tightly curled hair like this will naturally drop over time , as the effects of hairspray wear off and gravity kicks in – and as @entity12 discovered , this happens more quickly in warm or windy weather			1
while @entity12 ’s curls were enviably glossy , the tightly pinned - back style also managed to make her usually lustrous locks look thinner			1
@entity122 curls : @entity12 's hair looks more lackluster as she leaves her visit with a framed painting under her arm			1
the piece of art - a portrait of her holding @entity130 - was given to her by a young girl as she left online comments about the @entity5 ’s new style were mixed			1
some declared the hairdo was ‘ pretty ’ and ‘ elegant ’ , while others criticised the look , posting ‘ what ’s going with the hair ? that ’s the worst i ’ve seen her look ’ and ‘ i had hair like that when i was five ’			2
celebrity hairdresser @entity143 said : ‘ i think she might have been aiming for a @entity144 , a 1960s look to go with the dress			0
" of course @entity144 ’s hair was always much shorter than @entity12 ’s and therefore her @entity150 hair was never in danger of tipping into this odd hybrid of little girl ringlets and “ grande dame ”			1
still , while it may not be to everybody ’s taste , the look is rather regal , echoing those swept - back styles of princess @entity159 and @entity161			2
it is also suitably formal for an official visit , though a little ageing on a younger woman			0
favourite style : @entity12 opted for a similar curly style - but without the pinned back mid-section - when she attended a ceremony in @entity168 during her and @entity171 's royal tour of @entity172 in 2011 one society stylist who did not want to be named said of @entity12 ’s style : ‘ she seems too old for the ringlets and too young for the severity on the top			1
what a strange “ do ”			0
’ of course , this is n’t the first time the @entity5 has displayed a penchant for curls			0
there were ringlets poking out from under a stetson at the @entity187 stampede in 2011 on her royal tour of @entity172 , a ‘ yee - ha ’ look that should have been completed with a piece of straw in her mouth and a bit of thigh - slapping			2
she also sported ringlets at last year ’s @entity198 parade , and was criticised because her habit of constantly twirling them looked like a display of vanity on a sombre occasion			2
however , @entity74 points out how hard it is to dress hair for royal events			0
he said : ‘ @entity12 does suffer from time to time with ensuring her hair looks formal enough while looking young for certain occasions			2
’ in other words , it ’s impossible to have formal hair that looks young , because young hair is messy hair , and that ’s not very royal			0
@entity214 , who was hairdresser to the royal family for 35 years , has said that the @entity5 ’s hair is ‘ wonderful , maybe a little overdone at times ’			0
looks like yesterday was one of those times .			0

@entity12 's glossy mane was pinned in a half - up , half - down style with ringlets
she tried the look on a visit to the @entity24 in @entity26
not long after she arrived the heat and humidity caused @entity12 ’s curls to drop
