by @entity0 pivoting planets that lean one way and then change direction could be ideal places for alien life to thrive			0
this is according to a @entity8 research team who claim ' wobbling ' worlds would expose their surfaces to a more even heat from their suns			1
the theory suggests that planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds			1
a drunken planet ? tilted orbits might make some planets wobble like a top that 's almost done spinning , an effect that could maintain liquid water on the surface and with some water remaining liquid on the surface long - term , such planets could maintain favourable conditions for life , scientists claim			1
‘ planets like these are far enough from their stars that it would be easy to write them off as frozen , and poor targets for exploration , but in fact , they might be well - suited to supporting life , ’ said @entity34 , a @entity8 astrobiologist			1
‘ this could expand our idea of what a habitable planet looks like and where habitable planets might be found			2
’ where are these wobbling worlds ? scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this wobbling effect could happen , in orbit around the star @entity56 though it might seem far - fetched for a world to experience such see - sawing action , scientists have already spotted an arrangement of planets where this could happen , in orbit around the star @entity56			2
there , the orbits of two enormous planets were found to be inclined at an angle of 30 degrees relative to each other			2
compared to our solar system , that arrangement looks extreme			0
the orbits of @entity72 and its seven neighboring planets differ by seven degrees at most			2
even the tilted orbit of the dwarf planet @entity77 , which really stands out , is offset by a relatively modest 17 degrees			0
tilted orbits might make some planets wobble like a top that 's almost done spinning - an effect that could maintain liquid water on the surface			1
the team at the @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity8 looked at planets that have the same mass as @entity72 , orbit a sun - like star and have one or two gas giants orbiting nearby			1
in some cases , gravitational pulls from those massive planets could change the orientation of the terrestrial world 's rotation within tens to hundreds of thousands of years – a blink of an eye in geologic terms			0

alien life : the theory suggests that planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds ‘ knowing that this kind of planetary system existed raised the question of whether a world could be habitable under such conditions , ’ said @entity115 , a scientist at the @entity85 in @entity116 who was part of the team that studied the orbits of the two @entity121 planets			1
@entity72 's history indicates that the amount of sunlight glaciers receive strongly affects how much they grow and melt			0
extreme wobbling , like that seen in some models in this study , would cause the poles to point directly at the sun from time to time , melting the glaciers			0
as a result , some planets would be able to maintain liquid water on the surface despite being located nearly twice as far from their stars as @entity72 is from the sun. ‘ in those cases , the habitable zone could be extended much farther from the star than we normally expect , ’ said professor @entity144 , the lead author of the paper			1
‘ rather than working against habitability , the rapid changes in the orientation of the planet could turn out be a real boon sometimes			0

tilted orbits make planets wobble like a top that 's almost done spinning
@entity8 says this expose their surfaces to a more even heat from their suns
this means planets further out from their stars - outside what is known as the habitable zone - could be kept from turning into icy worlds
