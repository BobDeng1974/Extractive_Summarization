@entity0 will be out for two weeks after an injury sustained at @entity4 on monday night @entity0 is the latest in a long line of absentees at @entity1 , who have struggled with injuries all season former @entity1 assistant boss @entity33 has blamed @entity35 ’s fitness regime for the catalogue of injuries after @entity0 became the club ’s 43rd casualty of the season			1
@entity1 are currently also without summer signings @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , while @entity45 and @entity46 have just returned to training			1
@entity33 , who spent 12 years working alongside sir @entity48 at @entity10 , believes @entity35 ’s decision to bring in his own fitness specialist @entity51 to oversee first - team training at the start of the season and give @entity55 a broader role has led to the injury pile - up with so many players ‘ breaking down ’			1
‘ what ’s happened is a continuation of the same players getting injured all the time , so you have to look to the reasons why , ’ said @entity33 , who is now first - team coach at @entity64			2
manager @entity20 has overseen a chronic amount of injuries since taking charge in the summer ‘ i think @entity1 changed their thoughts on the fitness regime			1
they looked at it a little bit differently			2
‘ @entity55 , who was operating as head of sports science and was involved day to day with the first - team			2
he understood the ins and outs of how to keep players fit , how to keep them ready for competition			0
‘ then suddenly they moved him sideways and did something completely different			0
that may have had an effect			0
that one area has changed			0
‘ they ’ve brought in new people with a different way of doing things			0
the intensity of training may be one thing – it may be too intense , or not intense enough – but obviously slight changes have been made with the present way of doing things			0
‘ i would have thought the squad is big enough at @entity1 , because they can go out and get players in , but obviously they keep breaking down and they do n’t seem to be getting any better			0
they seem to get one back and lose another two			0
