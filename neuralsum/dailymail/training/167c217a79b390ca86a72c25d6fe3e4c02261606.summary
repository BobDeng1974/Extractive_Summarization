a @entity1 teacher was sentenced friday to 10 years in custody in a student rape case that led to the censure of a judge who partially blamed the victim			1
@entity8 , 55 , was resentenced by judge @entity9 exactly a year after he completed an initial one - month prison term for the crime			1
@entity8 appeared to grimace as the new sentence was read			2
he was then handcuffed and led away by deputies , pausing briefly to exchange words with family as he exited the courtroom			0
back for good : @entity18 , will now be going back to jail for 10 years			2
last time he was sentenced he got away with an astoninshingly light months long jail term the former high school teacher was convicted of raping a 14 - year - old student @entity8 pleaded guilty to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent in the 2007 incident involving 14 - year - old @entity28 , a freshman in his @entity30 business class			1
she committed suicide in 2010			0
the state @entity33 overturned @entity8 's initial sentence , citing in part comments from judge g. @entity37 who suggested the victim shared responsibility			1
@entity37 was censured and suspended for 31 days			0
he 's stepping down when his terms ends in january			0
@entity43 attorney @entity42 said he was pleased with the sentence that included five additional years that were suspended			0
outrageous : @entity8 has previously said that his 14 - year - old victim @entity28 ( pictured here ) was responsible for his actions because she appeared older than her age tragedy : the victim @entity28 killed herself while the case against @entity8 was pending ' the criminal justice system worked today , ' he said			1
@entity55 , the father of the victim , had hoped for a longer sentence but said it was better than the one - month previously serviced by @entity8			2
during the hearing , @entity42 asked judge @entity9 to reject defense attempts to make the victim 's conduct in the case a factor in @entity8 's sentencing			2
that included references by the defendant 's attorney to video - taped interviews of the victim recorded by law enforcement prior to her death			0
those recordings , which have never been made public , had been cited by @entity37 during his sentencing			0
under state law , children under 16 can not consent to sexual intercourse			0
' the last thing we want to do is sit here in the criminal justice system and say , ' what is the age ? ' it does n't matter			0
fourteen is way too young , ' @entity42 said			0
' there has to be punishment			0
' @entity8 's attorney , @entity88 , responded that there was no statute preventing the court from considering @entity28 's conduct			1
he pointed out that similar objections were never raised by prosecutors during @entity8 's first sentence , and said they were seeking a ' do - over , ' which @entity97 asserted was not allowed under state and federal law			1
district judge @entity100 : @entity37 sentenced @entity8 to one - month in jail in 2013			1
he has since admitted his huge mistake and even tried to re-sentence @entity8 in august of that year but failed in a letter to the court , @entity8 sought forgiveness and lamented the international publicity his case has generated			1
' no one can really appreciate and understand what it feels like to have so many people actually hate you and be disgusted by you , ' @entity8 wrote			2
' i do not mention this for the sake of sympathy , but it has been hard			0
' @entity42 asked the court to impose a 10 - year prison sentence with another 10 years suspended			1
that is the same sentence prosecutors sought last year when the case was before @entity37 , who instead adopted the much more lenient term suggested by @entity8 's defense attorney			2
without @entity28 , their primary witness , prosecutors struck a deal with @entity8 that initially allowed him to avoid prison altogether			1
@entity8 , however , violated that agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives ' children and entering into a relationship with an adult woman without telling his counselor			0
as a result , the case was revived and @entity8 pleaded guilty last year to the count of sexual intercourse without consent			2
distraught mother : @entity143 listens during a protest in august 2013 against the 30 - day sentence a judge imposed on the teacher who raped her daughter @entity28 when the girl was 14 years old during the first sentencing , @entity37 suggested the victim had as much control over her rape as the defendant and said she ' appeared older than her chronological age			1
' he gave @entity8 a 15 - year term with all but one month suspended			1
that triggered an appeal from prosecutors and ultimately resulted in the case being reassigned to @entity160			0
@entity37 's comments and the lenient sentence he handed down landed him before the state @entity33 for disciplinary proceedings , which resulted in a 30 - day suspension from the bench and a public censure for his misconduct in the case			1
in a sentencing memorandum filed this week , @entity42 wrote that a tough sentence for @entity8 was warranted given his position of authority over @entity28			2
' his position of trust as a high school teacher , abuse of that position , and violations against the victim overshadows all mitigating circumstances , ' @entity42 wrote .			0

@entity8 , 55 , was sentenced to 30 - days in jail in august 2013 for the rape of 14 - year - old @entity28
@entity186 outrageously said that @entity28 shared responsibility for the rape because she seemed older than she was
@entity28 took her own life in 2010
@entity8 was *47* when the crime *occurred*
an appeals process has now resulted in a re-sentencing
the prosecution had been pushing for 20 years in a state prison
