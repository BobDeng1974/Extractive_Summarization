police were today questioning a 62 - year - old man who was arrested in @entity15 , after a public appeal was launched by @entity13			1
location : a family from @entity6 , @entity7 , were on holiday in @entity9 when a man , believed to be @entity3 , attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop the young girl 's father noticed she was missing , left a store and spotted the youngster being led around a corner into an alleyway by a man , who was holding her by the hand			1
he shouted out and ran up to his daughter , pulling her away from the man who then left the scene			1
the incident has chilling similarities to the disappearance of three - year - old @entity37 , who went missing from her apartment in @entity40 in 2007 and has never been seen since			0
the family were on the beach a short time later and saw the same man , who spoke fluent @entity44 , sitting between some rocks and acting suspiciously			2
the victim â€™s father confronted the suspect , but he left before police arrived			1
but the quick - thinking family took photos of the man in an attempt to identify him			2
the middle - aged man was described as white , with pasty skin , of stocky build with broad shoulders			0
he was around 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins tall , 40 to 55 years old , with short dark hair and a dark moustache following the arrest , investigating officer @entity60 said : ' we arrested a man in the @entity15 area in connection with this incident earlier today			2
' the investigation is ongoing and i want to thank the public for their continued help			0
' @entity72 , left , and a computer generated image of how she may look now , six years after she disappeared the incident happened on january 30 last year , but @entity13 spokesman said the delay in issuing the pictures was due to @entity80 police having to exhaust their investigation before the appeal to find the man could move to @entity3			1
a near six - year search for @entity72 has yet to solve the mystery of her disappearance from the @entity88 resort of @entity89 on may 3 , 2007			0
there have been dozens of alleged sightings and leads over the years , but nothing has come close to establishing whether she is alive or dead			0
in the latest development last month , detectives believe a team of @entity3 cleaners may hold the key to her whereabouts			2
owners of apartments in the @entity40 holiday complex where @entity104 and her parents , @entity106 and @entity107 , were staying when she vanished have been asked about cleaners in the area who had a white van			0
