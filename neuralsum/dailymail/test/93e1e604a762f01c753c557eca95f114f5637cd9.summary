fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our dna , researchers have discovered			2
dating back hundreds of thousands of years , the instinct to avoid arachnids developed as an evolutionary response to a dangerous threat , the academics suggest			1
it could mean that arachnophobia , one of the most crippling of phobias , represents a finely tuned survival instinct			1
and it could date back to early human evolution in @entity18 , where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago			1
‘ humans were at perennial , unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments			2
‘ even when not fatal , a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks , terribly exposed to dangers , ’ he told the @entity42			0
the research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data			0
their reactions to images of spiders were very fast , even if their shape was distorted , when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear , such as needles and flies			2
the researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot			0
dr @entity29 said : ‘ detection , therefore , is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters — any improvements to the sensitivity , vigilance , reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage			0
’ the instinct could date back to early human evolution in @entity18 , where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago			1

instinct to avoid arachnids developed as evolutionary response to threat
*scientists* say it could mean arachnophobia represents survival instinct
could date back to early human evolution in @entity18 , where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago
