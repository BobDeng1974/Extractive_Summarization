@entity0 were made to work hard for their three points against @entity2 at @entity3 on saturday but @entity4 starred for @entity6 's team			1
he slotted @entity0 ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before @entity9 equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time			1
@entity2 continued to make things difficult for @entity0 until an @entity14 error led to @entity15 tapping in the winner			1
here , @entity18 's @entity17 gives his player ratings			2
@entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity20 – 5.5 never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by @entity9 with an incredible strike from inside @entity2 ’s half			1
too far off his line and one of the world ’s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed			2
@entity20 was on the winning team but will want to forget @entity9 beating him from his own half @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 leap up to block an attempt at goal from @entity2 's @entity36 @entity37 – 6.5 tidied up well on the rare occasion @entity2 threatened			1

@entity32 – 6 .5 looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as @entity2 tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half			1
@entity33 – 7 manned the back well and it took a goal - of - the - season contender for his team to concede against a @entity2 side that ran out of ideas at times			1
always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat			2
@entity58 – 6.5 tried to get forward and help hazard down the left			2
closed down well and put in a tireless performance			0
@entity61 – 6 a few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for @entity0			1
cleaned up well when needed to win back possession , however			0
@entity66 – 7 won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled @entity36			0
kept the midfield ticking over well			0
@entity71 international @entity70 ( left ) also produced an impressive display for @entity0 in the win over @entity2 @entity4 put @entity0 into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half @entity78 's ( right ) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury @entity70 – 7.5 a handful for @entity2 as he , @entity82 and hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half , though they were never taken			1
never short of a run			0
@entity82 – 6.5 scuppered one of @entity0 ’s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post , and was ultimately – and unfortunately – sacrificed for @entity78 at half time			1
@entity4 – 8.5 a live wire			1
master of the one - two and creating chances			2
ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give @entity0 a much - needed lead before @entity9 ’s equaliser			1
did n’t look tired , despite his weariness during international break			0
@entity15 - 7.5 looked a worthy replacement for @entity78 as he twice went close to giving @entity0 the lead in the opening seven minutes			1
scored in the second half when @entity6 really needed it , and it was deserved			0
@entity15 ( left ) slots in @entity0 's winner against @entity2 in the second half at @entity3 @entity110 : @entity78 – 6 came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury			1
immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field			0
@entity117 – 6 replaced @entity78 after the striker went off with an injury			0
had little to do but hold up the ball			0
@entity121 – 6 little to do but helped @entity0 get over the line			1
manager : @entity6 – 6.5 a frustrating afternoon for @entity6 , who was active on the touchline throughout , looking unhappy and muttering to himself			0
either way , it worked , and his team added three points to their title charge			0
@entity6 was active throughout the game on the touchline as @entity0 beat @entity2 2 - 1 @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity14 – 6.5 outstanding one - handed save at full stretch to deny @entity15 ’s deflected shot after less than three minutes			1
@entity133 took a penalty for @entity14 to concede the first			0
he ’d done his homework , going the same way @entity4 normally does , but beaten at the other side			1
his throw was intercepted by @entity70 which led to @entity0 's winner , though			2
@entity141 – 5.5 given the unwanted task of stopping @entity4 on his runs down the left wing on occasion			2
@entity146 – 6 stayed physical throughout , as per			0
captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously , but ultimately could not help them steal a point			0
@entity36 – 5.5 took the bait from @entity66 by sweeping the @entity155 ’s feet to give @entity0 a penalty and ultimately the lead			2
@entity146 ( right ) led @entity2 well but could not help his side take a point at @entity3 @entity36 ( right ) slides in on @entity66 to concede a penalty in the first half , from which @entity4 scored @entity163 – 5.5 a little unsure at times , largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team - mates			1
@entity169 – 6 strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue			0
@entity174 – 5.5 rightly booked for a late challenge on @entity176 but did not see much of the ball as @entity0 dominated midfield			2
@entity179 – 6 close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by @entity61 and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal			0
could not take the few chances that fell his way			0
@entity179 ( centre ) went close to scoring for @entity2 but ultimately did not impose himself on the game @entity9 ( second left ) is mobbed by his team - mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores @entity9 – 6.5 take a bow , @entity9			1
incredible goal as he channelled his inner @entity196 and , noticing @entity20 off his line , scored from in his own half			2
a little anonymous until that moment , but his faults were obliterated with that 66 - yard strike			1
@entity201 – 5.5 little joy as @entity2 rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion			2
closely marked by @entity33 throughout			0
@entity207 – 5.5 failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for @entity209			0
@entity201 ( left ) had little joy for @entity2 against @entity0 on saturday , despite his hard work @entity207 ( left ) floundered against @entity0 's stern defence at @entity3 on saturday @entity110 : @entity209 – 6 too little too late to have an influence			1
manager : @entity215 5.5 his team were constantly on the backfoot			0
referee : @entity218 6 correct decision with the penalty			0
not many controversial decisions to make aside from that , but had to be strict with bookings			0

@entity9 hit the net from 66 yards for @entity2 to level the scores
the moment is one to forget for @entity0 goalkeeper @entity20
