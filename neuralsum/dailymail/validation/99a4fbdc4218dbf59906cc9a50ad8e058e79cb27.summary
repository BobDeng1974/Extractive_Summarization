@entity0 is still suffering illness now , a year after contracting illness on a dream holiday a woman who fell seriously ill on a £ 13,500 trip of a lifetime to @entity7 is still taking medication a year later			1
just days after arriving in @entity9 , @entity7 , @entity0 and @entity10 say they were infected with gastric illnesses , which they say ruined their longed - for break			1
the pair were confined to their rooms for three days when they suffered diarrhoea , abdominal pain and nausea during the week - long , all inclusive stay at the @entity24 in march last year			1
and today , as the pair instruct expert lawyers at @entity27 to look into their case , they have told how their holiday was ruined			2
@entity0 , a nurse from @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ' we just could n't keep anything down			1
' we just thought it was a 24 - hour bug			2
' but as soon as we were eating we had to go back to the villa			0
we were just very ill and weak			0
' it totally ruined the holiday of a lifetime			0
' we both came back suffering from really bad symptoms and it 's left us with an illness we have never had before			0
' the holiday was part of a two - week under the @entity45 tour arranged through @entity46 , which began on march 15 last year			2
both @entity0 and @entity10 , a service manager for @entity49 , took antibiotics which they had taken on holiday with them as a precautionary measure and , following their return to the @entity56 , they also sought treatment			1
@entity0 saw a private medical specialist and also had blood tests taken and an ultrasound scan due to the severity of her illness problems			2
and now - nearly a year on - she says she still feels ill. she added : ' this was supposed to be a holiday of a lifetime which we would treasure forever , but sadly when we look back now we only think of the turmoil we 've been through			0
' i was not happy about some of the food served as on occasions it was undercooked and i had to send it back			0
a £ 13,500 holiday of a lifetime turned into a living hell for @entity0 and @entity10 who say they were infected with gastric illnesses a holiday to @entity80 that should have left a couple with lovely memories , has instead left them in turmoil ' also sometimes some of the food served did not appear fresh and some of the food on occasions did not appear hot enough			1
' following falling ill , our holiday was ruined and was utterly embarrassing to say the least			0
' now , we just want answers as to why we fell ill , so that we can begin - to move on from what we 've been through			0
' @entity92 , the legal expert in @entity27 's @entity94 team who is representing @entity0 and @entity10 , said : ' we are conducting investigations into what was the cause of the illness @entity0 and @entity10 suffered from			1
the couple 's week stay at the all - inclusive stay at the @entity24 and @entity102 turned sour after the pair fell ill ' as we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the @entity24 and @entity102 and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible			1
' sadly , their story of working and saving to afford a luxury break only for the holiday to be ruined by serious illness is an unfortunate one , and understandably such issues have left @entity0 and @entity10 frustrated and desperate for answers regarding the illness they have suffered			1
' @entity46 have denied liability and we are seeking to establish what caused them to fall ill. ' a @entity46 spokeswoman said : ' @entity46 take any claims surrounding the health and well - being of our customers very seriously indeed			0
we are aware of this case , which is currently with our legal team and continues to be under investigation so it would be inappropriate to comment further on this particular incident at this stage			0
