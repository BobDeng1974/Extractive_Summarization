a missing schoolgirl was murdered by a 60 - year - old man who called police two weeks prior to the killing to see how officers would react to her disappearance , a jury heard today			2
@entity7 , 60 , was said to have had an ' inappropriate sexual interest ' in 15 - year - old @entity9 and took advantage of her ' chaotic and dysfunctional ' upbringing which had left her ' very troubled and vulnerable '			1
he is accused of murdering the schoolgirl , from @entity13 , @entity14 , between august 23 and august 27 , 2007			1
@entity7 was arrested in connection with her disappearance in september last year and is currently on trial at @entity38			2
the jury was told today how he allegedly rang police anonymously less than a fortnight before she went missing to tell officers that a ' problem child ' had turned up on his doorstep having been thrown out by her father			0
@entity47 , prosecuting , told jurors that the @entity49 believes he did so to ' test the water '			0
he told the court : ' we allege that he wanted to see what official reaction there would be to the suggestion of a 15 - year - old girl turning up on the doorstep of a 52 - year - old man and the answer he learned , we suggest , was very little reaction			0
' the court also heard how eight months after the schoolgirl 's disappearance , @entity7 's friend , @entity63 , 46 , was overheard in conversation saying he had used his car to dump the teenager 's body			1
mr @entity70 said : ' he then went on to say : " i did n't want to have sex with her , they made me "			0
' the prosecutor said a ' highly stoned ' @entity63 told a 16 - year - old boy that @entity7 had killed @entity9 and had then made him have sex with her before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body			1
mr @entity70 said : ' he ( @entity63 ) said that he had put the body in the boot and was saying that he was going to set his car on fire			0
he was frightened that he was going to get arrested , or that @entity81 ( @entity7 ) would kill him			0
' @entity9 ( right ) was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home ( left ) and , despite appeals from police and a £ 12,000 reward offer from tv host @entity31 , no trace of her has ever been found detectives hunting for @entity9 , who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago , dug up a farmer 's field amid fears she maybe buried in a shallow grave but still no trace of her has been found an extensive proof of life inquiry has not found any evidence @entity9 is alive and she has yet to claim a ' significant ' inheritance sum left to her on her mother 's death once she turned 18 , the jury heard			1
the prosecutor said : ' the prosecution say that even though no body has been recovered , you can be sure that @entity9 is dead			0
' the court heard that @entity9 's father reported her missing on august 26 and clearly stated she was 15 , but her date of birth was wrongly entered on the police system as 1962			1
' in consequence , the matter was dealt with as though @entity9 were an adult aged 45 who had moved on voluntarily , rather than a girl of 15 who was worryingly missing from home , ' said mr @entity70			2
that approach was not corrected until september 7 when police inquiries then commenced , he added			0
@entity7 , formerly of @entity13 , denies murder and intending to pervert the course of public justice by intimidating witnesses and providing false information to the police in their investigations			2
@entity63 , of @entity13 , denies sexual penetration of a corpse and assisting an offender in disposing of a body			1

@entity9 was aged 15 when she disappeared from @entity13 home
despite police appeals and a £ 12,000 reward , she has never been found
