now scientists have revealed that the benefits of generosity extend beyond a warm glow			2
providing tangible help to others appears to protect our health and lengthens our lives , they claim			0

stressful experiences included such things as serious illness , burglary , job loss , financial difficulties or death of a family member			0

' these findings go beyond past analyses to indicate that the health benefits of helping behavior derive specifically from stress - buffering processes and provide important guidance for understanding why helping behavior specifically may promote health and , potentially , for how social processes in general may influence health			2
the study – in conjunction with @entity98 and @entity99 – points out that although it is known that social isolation and stress have significant impacts on health , research has failed to establish whether receiving support from others helps protect individuals from stress in the same way as ‘ givers ’			0
