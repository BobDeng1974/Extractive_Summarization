last night , a few days after returning from our annual family holiday , i went through all the photographs we had taken on our various smartphones over the fortnight			1
it came as no surprise to discover there was not one single snap of me			1
i hate having my picture taken			1
what floored me , though , was how many there were of @entity13 and @entity14 , my teenage girls			1
they had clearly been taking pictures of themselves endlessly			1
the results made me proud and depressed in equal measure			1
stupid me to assume they 'd come on holiday to admire @entity31 culture - what they really wanted to capture for posterity was countless images of themselves			1
if i sound a little jealous , you 'll have to forgive me			2
staring in awe at one photograph after another of my daughters in skimpy bikinis was enough to drive the point home that i have never come close to looking like that			1
and it was n't just their beauty that made me seethe with an uncomfortable mix of pride and bitterness			1
i was also flooded with unease at the confidence they exuded			1
it seemed to me as if they were saying to the world : ' we 're beautiful , and we know it			1
yet somehow still so very innocent			2
i may have given birth to these two gorgeous creatures , but their adolescence will be a world apart from mine			1
how will i ever advise them how to navigate the passions they will arouse in boys and the jealousies they 'll engender in girls ? as someone who has hated the way she has looked since childhood , i am at a loss at how to guide them through this delicate stage of their lives			2
i 've written before about coming to terms with my looks , and how it has taken me most of my adult life to accept the fact that my face will never launch even the smallest pedalo , let alone a thousand ships			2
i am a bit of an odd - looking bird			2
longed for a different face : @entity21 aged 14 it 's easier to accept the cards i was dealt now i am a 43 - year - old mother of four			1
i have a lovely home and family , a job i adore and a husband who does n't seem to care how i look as long as i am happy			2
which , believe it or not , i am			2
but for most of my teenage years , it was a different story			2
i did n't need girls at school to tell me that a birthmark over my right eye left it looking wonky - or that a mis - shaped jaw made my front teeth stick out			2
i was under no illusions			2
but how i longed for a different face - one that might get me to the periphery of the ' in ' crowd at school , which all the pretty girls inhabited			2
it seemed an even harsher twist of fate that both my parents were stunningly good looking			2
at school open days i would watch , pained , as girls in my class looked in amazement from them , to me , and back again			2
no , i was n't adopted			2
yes , my mother probably did wonder if i had been swapped at birth			0
of course my parents tried to tell me i had other attributes			0
my mother would say things like : ' you 've got an attractive face , darling			0
it 's far more interesting than being conventionally pretty			0
' all of which skirted around the fact that my face was so disappointing not even a mother could call it beautiful			0
and so like everyone who suffers from rock - bottom self - esteem , i compensated in other ways			0
i became an accomplished character actress , and tried not to feel disappointed at getting the part of @entity141 in @entity142 when i would have loved to have been cast as @entity143			0
i worked really hard at being a loyal , reliable friend			0
i was made head girl only to lose my badge on a skiing trip a few months later when i followed my friends out of our hotel room and down a drain pipe to go to a disco			0
it was a small price to pay for being temporarily included in something the cool crowd were doing			0
now , when i look back on it , i see that everything i did as a teenager was to balance the inadequacy of my appearance			0
which is why , as a mother , i marvel at the fact that , through some genetic malfunction , i have given birth to the very girls who terrified me at school			0
@entity13 and @entity14 are the antithesis of my teenage self			1
they will never know how it feels to stand in a girls ' loo trying not to cry because someone has made a barb about their funny face			0
neither has a clue how it feels to be lonely at school			1
neither seems to realise how truly privileged they are			0
i know i should be relieved for them that their mobiles never stop ringing ; that when they post a @entity185 snap of themselves , they are inundated with compliments			0
but their effortless confidence needles me a little			1
i often watch them as they saunter into school , flicking their hair nonchalantly			0
worlds apart : @entity21 knows her daughters ' adolescence will be much different to her own how does it feel , i wonder , to take your place in the world without being held back by the slightest insecurity about your appearance ? they say beauty is a curse			1
not from where i 'm standing it is n't			0
a charity report last week confirmed that looks are more important than ever			0
the @entity211 , published by the @entity212 , said that girls in @entity214 today rank as some of the saddest in the world because of concerns over their body image			1
so in some ways i thank my lucky stars that my girls show no such concerns			0
of course , if you asked @entity13 and @entity14 they could come up with a long list of flaws they perceive themselves to have			1
certainly , when i told them i was tackling this issue , they pleaded with me to make it clear that under no circumstances do they believe themselves to be beautiful			0
but , for me , this is like hearing @entity236 complain about her facial mole or @entity238 her red hair			0
@entity14 is only 13 and already flirts with an ease i have never possessed			1
our local takeaway man is smitten - although @entity14 tells me she only does it to get extra spring rolls			1
researchers have found that attractive parents pass on good looks to daughters , but not to sons @entity13 , too , has admirers who really should know better			1
a taxi driver recently commented how much she looks like a young @entity252			0
instead of feeling proud , i found myself snapping : ' she 's only 15			1
' the poor man looked horrified			0
i have shown both the girls photographs of how i looked at their age and they howl with laughter			0
i hope it helps them understand how it feels to be that girl , whoever she is			0
i 'd like to invite her over for tea and force my daughters to see that behind every @entity267 there is someone like me desperate to emerge			1
but they just tell me that 's weird and could i please butt out			0
i 'll never forget once interviewing @entity272 and her telling me that she stood @entity273 and @entity274 in front of a mirror every day and told them how stunning they were			0
she was determined that her own feelings of inadequacy would never be passed on to her daughters			1
it 's a good lesson and one i have tried to adopt with @entity13 and @entity14			1
i feel i owe them praise , whether they need it or not			0
it 's hardly their fault they look this way any more than being so plain was mine			0
the other day when we were all standing in front of the mirror , me cringing in the background , @entity13 said : ' you know , @entity296 , you 're too harsh on yourself because you are beautiful in your own way			1
' perhaps , just sometimes , it helps mothers to hear it from their daughters , too .			1

@entity303 , 43 , seethes with an uncomfortable mix of pride and bitterness
she *envies* the looks and confidence of her daughters @entity13 , 15 , and @entity14 , 13
their adolescence is a world apart from hers
she grew up feeling ugly and lonely
