a group of @entity2 governors tore into president @entity3 on wednesday over his forthcoming immigration directive and threatened to sue him for breaking the law			1
' i would go to the courts , ' @entity7 gov. @entity6 said wednesday during an annual retreat for the party 's chief executives			1
' outgoing @entity15 gov. @entity14 accused @entity3 of ' sticking his finger into the eye of the @entity19 people ' and said his state may take legal action against the president , too			1
the outgoing governor of @entity15 said its a ' possibility ' his state would sue the president over immigration ' i think that ’s probably a very real possibility , ' @entity14 , a probably 2016 presidential candidate , said			1
the comments came during a panel at the @entity28 conference in @entity29 , @entity30 , wednesday afternoon , hours after the @entity40 announced via a @entity42 video that @entity3 would finally make public his immigration plans during a prime - time address on thursday evening			1
the following day he will sign any official paperwork associated with his declaration during a rally at a @entity49 , @entity50 , high school			0
the president 's speech detailing the major policy adjustment will be mostly unseen by @entity19 when it airs , however , as @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 will not carry it live			1
according to news reports , the @entity40 put out feelers to the networks about having his remarks broadcast but they seemed unwilling to preempt hit shows that evening			2
as a result , the president 's press shop never put in an official request to have it aired during primetime and regular programming will proceed as usual			0
the @entity40 will air the speech on its website , though , and interested @entity19 can watch it there at 8 p.m. est or on a handful of other networks , including @entity77 - language channels @entity78 and @entity79 , as well as @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
@entity78 is planning to interrupt it 's telecast of the @entity84 's to air it , the @entity83 has confirmed			0
what the president will say is still a mystery			0
the @entity40 has been tight - lipped in its descriptions of the president 's plans during its daily dealings with reporters			2
numerous news publications have reported his executive order will include work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants , namely those who were brought to the @entity19 as children before 2010 and those who have @entity19 citizen children			1
it is also also expected to authorize a half million new work permits for foreigners who graduated from @entity19 colleges and obtained degrees in subjects like science and engineering			2
senate majority leader @entity110 said wednesday that the planned executive actions would affect immigrants who ' have deep ties in @entity19 , are law - abiding and have children or spouses who are @entity19 citizens or permanent residents			1
' @entity119 congressman @entity118 said tuesday he believed the president would issue two - year work permits to illegal immigrants who have been in the @entity19 for at least live years , and possibly 10 , as long as they pay for and pass a background check			1
' you 're going to submit your fingerprints and if they come back clear , he is going to give you a work authorization for two years and a social security card			0
he 's going to put you on the books paying taxes , ' @entity118 told @entity81 host @entity131			0
he also suggested @entity3 's directive would provide allow an untold number of agricultural workers to stay in the @entity19 legally			1
president @entity3 is pictured here signing the @entity135 of 2014 , into law in the @entity137 of the @entity40 on wednesday			2
on friday he is expected to sign an executive order halting deportations for as many as 5 million illegal immigrants whatever action the president takes is likely to be unpopular with @entity19 , though			1
an @entity55 / @entity142 poll conducted last weekend found that 48 percent of @entity19 opposed the president making changes to the immigration system through an executive order , and just 38 percent were for it			2
@entity2 governors - many of whom are mulling presidential bids next year - were fuming over the rumored proposals on wednesday afternoon , saying they would place numerous burdens on their states			2
@entity153 gov. @entity152 worried about the logistics of providing driver 's licences to illegal immigrants shielded from deportation by @entity3			1
' that would be very difficult in our state , ' he said , according to the @entity162			0
meanwhile , @entity164 gov. @entity163 called the idea of expanding work permits in his state to accommodate @entity3 's order ' unacceptable			1
' ' i am fighting it , not helping it , ' he said			0
recalling the difficulty he and his wife experienced while trying to obtain legal documents for a @entity176 teenager they were caring for , @entity163 explained it took them ' nearly 11 years ' to finish the paperwork			0
' why should everybody just get one tomorrow ? ' he pondered			0
meanwhile , @entity183 gov. @entity182 , a former federal lawmaker , endorsed a strategy under consideration by congressional @entity2 to ' use the power of the purse to work the will of the @entity19 people			1
' ' every major change in the life of our nation has been done with the consent of our government , ' a visibly upset @entity182 reportedly said			0
' i think it would be a profound mistake ' for the president to act unilaterally , he added			0
@entity201 gov. @entity200 refused to engage on the subject of illegal immigration at all , saying as he had several times in the past , that he would make his views on federal issues known when and if he runs for president			2
but he did come out swinging against @entity2 in @entity208 floating a government shut down unless @entity119 go along with their plan to bar immigration agencies from using federal funds to support @entity3 's edict			2
' it ’s incumbent upon everybody in @entity216 , to do their jobs			0
and running the government is their job , ' @entity200 said			0
' all this kind of hysteria about shutdowns to me is just people who can make news			0
' @entity227 gov. @entity226 said if the government did shut down during the upcoming spending fight , it would be the president 's fault for not signing the @entity2 's hypothetical legislation that would block his executive order @entity119 congressman @entity118 of @entity235 , center , delivers remarks during a press conference in front of the @entity40 on wednesday			2
@entity118 stood alongside immigrant farm , food and commercial workers from across the country to remind @entity19 of the people behind the @entity245 meal and to call on @entity3 to deliver the most inclusive changes to immigration policy possible through executive action @entity227 gov. @entity226 was also reticent to share his personal views on immigration reform , telling his peers , ' we will deal with people here illegally compassionately and fairly ' and calling for enhanced security at @entity19 's southern border			1
weighing in on the issue before @entity208 , though , he said if the government did shut down during the upcoming spending fight , it would be the president 's fault for not signing the @entity2 's hypothetical legislation that would block his executive order			0
' i do n’t think the president should shut down the government simply because he wants to break the law , ' @entity226 said			0
only @entity264 gov. @entity263 indicated a willingness to embrace amnesty for illegal immigrants currently residing in the country , telling his fellow @entity2 governors , ' we ’ve got to think about what ’s going to bring about healing			1
' ' i do n’t like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line			0
we may have to do it			0
' ' i ’m open to it , i will tell you that , ' @entity263 , a possible dark horse presidential candidate , added			0
@entity7 's @entity6 warned his allies not to be so distracted by @entity3 's immigration actions that they lose focus on other important issues like the economy , taxes , energy and education , however			1
the @entity288 said @entity6 characterized the president 's latest move as a ' cynical ploy ' to blind republicans to divert @entity2 ' attention away from other more pressing issues			2
' come out with me on the road and i ’ll tell you there are n’t a whole lot of people talking about immigration reform , ' @entity6 told them .			1

' i would go to the courts , ' @entity7 gov. @entity6 said wednesday . ' this is illegal '
@entity15 gov. @entity14 accused @entity3 of ' sticking his finger into the eye of the @entity19 people ' and said his state may take legal action , too
@entity3 will announce his immigration plans *tonight* at 8 p.m. est - but the major networks wo *n't* carry it live
he is expected to halt deportations for illegal immigrants who arrived in the @entity19 as children and parents of @entity19 citizen children
