the name @entity1 is n’t one that was taken altogether seriously until february 25			1
this was a youngster who had been signed speculatively by @entity5 three years previously and one - via a trio of loan spells largely down to work permit issues - who would n’t be knocking on the first team door for a good while			0
that was until he picked up a ball 30 yards from goal against @entity16 during that night in the @entity17 last - 16			2
eyebrows raised , eyes slightly widened ; is this the man - farmed out to @entity45 after tricky spells with @entity42 and @entity43 have been missing ? the answer already appears to be yes , given @entity5 ’s admittance that @entity1 would be on his way back to the club for pre-season after three campaigns away			1
‘ he will definitely come back to us , ’ @entity5 told @entity52 after @entity54 ’s drubbing of @entity55			2
‘ he is maturing well			0
’ @entity1 has been the @entity58 ’ star of this tournament thus far , scoring in that 3 - 1 win against @entity61 and co while putting in a more disciplined and resolute shift against the @entity64 on friday night			2
and he now has the opportunity to hammer a final nail into @entity68 ’s coffin when the sides meet in @entity70 on tuesday			1
@entity64 job : @entity1 celebrating following their incredible victory sandwiched : the 21 - year - old being crowded out by @entity75 ( left ) and @entity76 finisher : @entity1 celebrating his goal for @entity33 against @entity16 in february @entity79 : @entity54 @entity81 ’s men are already booked on the first flight out of @entity83 when the whistle is blown on a wretched campaign that began with enthusiastic hope rather than searing expectation			1
the goodwill shown towards the manager - who rightly , on the whole at least , chose to blood the youngsters in the first two defeats - will be somewhat tempered if they suffer the ignominy of losing all three group games			0
with @entity1 pulling the strings for @entity54 , that is a very real possibility			1
while his goal against @entity55 was well - taken - particularly his decision to hang back on the edge of the box to wait for the second ball - there were two other moments that will have @entity81 twitchy			0
the first saw the 21 - year - old , as against @entity16 in february , pick up a ball way out , drive at the @entity107 and send a stinging effort just wide ; the second he pulled to the right , checked inside before crafting a beautifully - weighted ball alongside the centre - half for @entity113 to poke home			2
it is from those pockets - @entity119 would tell you they are ‘ between the lines ’ - where the @entity68 could suffer			0
the manager is likely to play @entity124 in the middle of midfield , and he could be paired with @entity127 - their primary job to stop @entity1 roaming deep and dictating proceedings			2
a lack of pace and protection in that area has been @entity68 ’s undoing , although it ’s debatable whether that obvious problem will be fixed in time for tuesday given the personnel thought to be in the @entity139 and then there is @entity1 ’s naivety of youth which is likely to trouble the full - backs			1
he sees no issue in neglecting his central station to go and have a roam wide			0
it ’s refreshing to watch			0
shock : @entity54 players celebrating during their over @entity55 baby bump : @entity1 celebrating his goal against the @entity83 side for all of the new - age @entity68 we ’ve witnessed over the past ten days , those @entity119 lines and covert rotation , there has n’t been one man to drop off and purposefully pick holes			1
couple @entity1 ’s innocence with some blistering pace and confidence in possession - see his penalty appeal against the @entity64 for reference - @entity43 have a real player on their hands			1
the only potential difficulty will be his ability , or otherwise , to heed strict instructions , although in the first two games he seems adept at tracking back and helping the midfield five			0
‘ i believe i ’m ready to play for @entity43 next season			1
i have the capacity to play there and i am only waiting for the opportunity , ’ he said this week			0
no kidding , and @entity68 could find out to their cost			0

@entity1 rose to prominence after scoring against @entity16 in february
has starred at the @entity178 as @entity54 qualified from @entity27
set to return to parent club @entity43 next season after @entity33 loan
set to play against @entity68 in final @entity27 game on tuesday
