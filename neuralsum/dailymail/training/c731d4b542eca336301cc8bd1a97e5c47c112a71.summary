' why is @entity13 fast becoming the most obese and unhealthy nations on earth ? is this because we are a nation of self - obsessed , weak - minded people with no self - control ? no. is it because we are a nation that for far too long has been told to steer clear of foods naturally high in fat , which naturally trigger our fullness hormone , and instead told to eat 6 - 8 servings of processed carbohydrate a day , and wonder why we are still hungry after eating 3 cups of rice or 6 slices of bread ?
