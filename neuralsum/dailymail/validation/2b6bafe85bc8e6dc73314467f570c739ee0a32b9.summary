his attack on mr @entity71 continued today , with his account of how he watched the prime minister 's speech on television			0

' there was no mention of this last week when he was in a complete panic about the polls			0

he said : ' the @entity191 continues to believe independence is the best option for @entity3 , and the survey finds most @entity3 think this is where the constitutional journey will take us			2
' we also believe strongly that @entity3 being taken out of the @entity49 in a referendum in circumstances , where a majority of @entity3 had voted to stay in , would be massively damaging economically and have major constitutional implications			2
' the referendum on independence was a wonderful experience of democratic engagement , bringing people into politics who in some cases had not been involved in decades , if at all			0
