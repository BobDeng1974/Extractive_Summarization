the @entity0 today resisted calls to slash the interest rate to zero and has also stopped pumping more cash into the struggling @entity5 economy			1
@entity7 boss @entity6 had urged the bank to lower its base rate further and use more quantitative easing to help the @entity5 weather the eurozone debt crisis			1
but this lunchtime interest rates were held at their record low of 0.5 per cent and additional @entity14 was also ruled out despite economists ' seriously considering ' it			2
the most recent £ 50 billion injection into the @entity0 ’s quantitative easing programme took place in february but members of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) have vetoed increasing the stock of asset purchases from £ 325 billion			0
refusal : the @entity0 's @entity21 has decided not to pump more money into the @entity5 economy the decision comes as the pressure mounts on political leaders to draw up a firm action plan to tackle the mounting eurozone crisis , with @entity32 appearing to move closer to taking an @entity34 bailout and a crucial election in @entity36 imminent			1
but hopes for the recovery were boosted earlier today when a closely - watched survey of the powerhouse services sector in may revealed robust growth , allaying some concerns over a worse - than - expected report on the smaller manufacturing sector last friday			0
pressure on the bank to implement more stimulus measures has been mounting in recent weeks after official figures showed the @entity5 ’s double - dip recession was deeper than previously thought , with a 0.3 per cent fall in the first quarter of 2012			1
and inflation continued to fall in april , providing more leeway for a fresh money injection			0
while the @entity0 ’s decision echoed that of the @entity46 yesterday , @entity55 ’s central bank moved to shore up its powerhouse economy by slashing its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008 , dropping the one - year deposit rate to 3.25 per cent from 3.5 per cent			2

@entity71 , chief economist at @entity72 , said he still expects an additional £ 50 billion @entity14 boost in august - but action could be taken as soon as next month			2
he said : ' we consider that it would be wrong to rule out more qe			0
the crisis in the euro area poses a number of very obvious downside risks to the @entity5 economy			1
' meanwhile @entity5 growth looks set to remain below trend , at best , in any case over the next year			1
' @entity85 , the @entity87 ’s head of economic analysis , said the @entity21 ’s decision would have been a ' tricky one '			0
she said : ' it seems that a ‘ wait and see ’ position has been adopted for the moment			0
the ongoing crisis in the euro area will continue to put pressure on fragile business conditions for the foreseeable future			0
' but we still expect the @entity5 economy to improve modestly later in the year , with further falls in inflation providing some support to family incomes			1
