made a hash of things : @entity3 's odd name is revealed on @entity4 in an example of what could be the silliest name ever given to a child , it appears that one mother has christened her baby girl @entity11			1
however , instead of taking to @entity13 , which spawned the now ubiquitous preface , the mother posted the announcement on @entity4 , compounding her apparent # fail			1
while it is not clear whether the screenshot is a joke , the possibility that a child has been named hashtag still exists			0
while some have considered that the little girl will grow up to be the living embodiment of the degradation of the @entity28 language , others have simply despaired for the mother , whose last name is @entity30			0
the caption that accompanies the photo says : ' @entity11 was born at 10 oclock last nite			2
she weys 8pounds and i luv her so much ! ! ! ! ! ! ' the image has spread across the internet and been met with universal criticism			0
the news that there could be a child named after the word most associated with @entity13 is reminiscent of the @entity43 couple last year who named their girl after the @entity4 ' like ' button			1
@entity47 and @entity48 were apparently looking to call their child something unique so they stumped for the @entity4 moniker to enable their child to stand out from the crowd			1
what 's in a name ? whether it is a joke or not , this child will forever be associated with @entity60 but they are not the only parents who have picked names inspired by the social media revolution			0
@entity65 of @entity66 called his baby girl ' @entity4 ' in honour of the website 's role in the @entity71 of last year , which led to the ousting of @entity66 's president @entity73 after 30 years in power			2
how long before someone is named ' @ ' ?			0
