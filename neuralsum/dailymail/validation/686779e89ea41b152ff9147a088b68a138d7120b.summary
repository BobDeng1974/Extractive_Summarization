adorning a large section of a wall in the gym beneath @entity4 ’s @entity3 is a picture of the @entity7 team smiling for the cameras and showing off the @entity9			1
it was taken last year and the expressions worn by captain @entity12 and his colleagues convey a genuine sense of pride			2
that silver shield has eluded the national team this year , following defeat in @entity19 , but it is not the precious metal they covet anyway			2
on head coach @entity25 ’s watch , the trophy cabinet has been kept stocked			2
in the course of three years , in addition to the @entity9 , @entity7 have lifted the @entity28 ( annually ) , the @entity29 , the @entity30 and the @entity31			1
the latter prize , for beating @entity33 in december , 2012 , was received with special relish			2
@entity35 sets off on a run during training as @entity7 prepare to face @entity38 but what the coaches and players really crave is a cup that conveys meaningful achievement , and at last that is within their grasp			1
@entity12 summed up the mood : ‘ as a player you want to be picking up silverware			2
we 've collected the odd bit here and there , but to pick up the main trophy would be great			0
’ the ‘ main trophy ’ , newly commissioned , for winning the @entity57 is @entity7 ’s for the taking			1
success would also end a generation of under - achievement			0
it is staggering that the world ’s wealthiest rugby country has had so little to show for so much effort and investment in the modern era			0
@entity7 won three of the first four @entity57 titles ( 2000 , 2001 , 2003 ) but since then have finished top just once in 11 seasons			1
so near , but so far has been the story of many @entity73 campaigns , not least under the current regime			0
three times @entity76 ’s men have finished runners - up , with four wins out of five			0
@entity79 ( twice ) , and @entity38 have derailed the @entity80 on its route to a @entity82			1
everyone in the @entity85 camp has grown weary of the perennial talk about the need for ‘ tangible ’ reward , to use lock @entity90 ’s apt phrase			0
defeat by @entity91 shattered the latest quest for a clean sweep to propel the host nation into their @entity95 , but @entity7 are still in prime position in terms of the three - way title tussle			1
this year , four wins from five should be sufficient to clinch the trophy , which will be at @entity4 in anticipation of a coronation at about 7pm			2
there is a replica at @entity107 , just in case @entity91 run amok and beat @entity109 with room to spare and leave @entity7 chasing a points - difference tally that proves beyond them			1
meanwhile , in @entity112 , @entity79 will expect to benefit from the enforced absence of @entity115 captain @entity114 but they would require @entity118 and @entity119 resistance on an epic scale to take the title			2
the made - for - tv staggered schedule affords @entity76 ’s side the luxury of a precise target but that could be a blessing or a curse			0
being aware of the bigger picture could be a distraction for some @entity7 players , hence the coaches ’ desire to burden only a select few with the main decision - making responsibilities			1
it will be up to @entity12 and his half - backs , @entity137 and @entity138 , to set a patient tone once what is needed has been explained to the whole squad before their pre-match warm - up			0
the remarkable maturity of @entity7 no 10 @entity144 , at just 22 , should be a telling asset on a day when the challenge is equal parts mental and physical			1
@entity7 's players look on in disbelief as @entity91 clinch the 2014 @entity57 title by beating @entity38 @entity138 has shown a huge amount of maturity for some one who is just 22 @entity155 ’s @entity38 team do not boast glorious form , far from it , despite the emphatic 29 - 0 victory over @entity115 in @entity112 last weekend			1
crucially , that game took place 24 hours after @entity7 beat @entity109 and since then @entity38 have had to fly home , patch themselves up and catch the @entity161 to @entity162 , while also dealing with the distraction of a club v country row over fly - half @entity165			1
what the visitors will bring is physical presence			0
the @entity118 are massive but this @entity73 pack has dealt with all - comers in recent times , and the graduated return of @entity174 and @entity175 in the second row should add dynamism and line - out nous to the mix. @entity180 could have a big role to play coming off the bench for @entity7 @entity174 should add dynamism to @entity7 's back row behind the packs , @entity7 are more settled and threatening			1
@entity187 ’s match - up with @entity188 will be intriguing , but only if the @entity118 threequarters are let off the leash			0
@entity144 can make holes in the @entity193 defence but @entity7 can not afford to be as wasteful as they were in beating @entity109			1
replacements could also have a big say and @entity7 will look to the likes of @entity197 and @entity180 to generate momentum , @entity199 to provide physicality and leadership , and @entity202 to make an impact with his astute kicking game			2
whether or not @entity206 and @entity207 play a part in a points chase , time will tell			0
amid the maelstrom , the primary demand from @entity76 will be for cool @entity73 heads			0
@entity12 should have plenty of leadership support , from @entity175 and a raft of club captains in the ranks : @entity218 and @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity137			0
there may be several rookies in white , but there are also enough established players			0
together , they can ensure that the plot is not lost and that the ‘ main trophy ’ is won .			0

@entity7 will know what they need to do to win the title when they kick off
the agony of missing out on the title last year will be in the *memories*
@entity7 are best placed to win the @entity57 title if they beat @entity38
