dna samples from thousands of foreign criminals have been deleted from @entity3 databases due to a legal loophole			1
police are not allowed to store swabs or fingerprints from offenders who were convicted abroad , it emerged yesterday			0
the scandal was revealed in the annual report from @entity3 ’s independent biometrics watchdog			1
in one case , police had to delete samples from a burglary suspect after he was arrested in the @entity3 , even though he had served 13 years for similar offences elsewhere in @entity18			1
scandal : dna samples from thousands of foreign criminals have been deleted in @entity3 ( file photo ) police are only allowed to store biometric data when an offender has been convicted in @entity3			1
if they are merely arrested , the data must be destroyed			0
the biometrics commissioner , @entity26 , said : ‘ this seemed to me to be an obviously unsatisfactory state of affairs which might well be putting the @entity3 public at unnecessary risk			1
’ he continued : ‘ the effect of those legislative arrangements has been that the @entity34 profiles and fingerprints of some thousands of individuals who have been convicted of such offences outside @entity38 and @entity39 have had to be deleted from the @entity3 national databases			2
’ until 2008 , officers were allowed to keep profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity45			0
the details of about 4.5million people are held on the @entity3 database even though one in five – including 40,000 children – have never been charged			2
even those convicted in other countries can have their details deleted if innocent in the @entity3 ( file photo ) however , a landmark ruling from @entity18 judges has meant that it is now unlawful for police to store swabs and fingerprints from suspects later cleared of wrongdoing			1
the current rules mean a foreign suspect could be arrested in @entity3 but , after being released , their dna would still be deleted from @entity3 databases even though police know they have been convicted of a crime elsewhere			1
they could then commit an offence in @entity3 and get away with it , because officers would not be able to use their dna samples to secure a conviction			2
the @entity74 said that for the most serious criminals – such as rapists , murders and terrorists – exceptions could be made			0
however , in order to retain dna from the majority of overseas offenders , police must repeatedly visit them to take further samples and fingerprints under different sections of the @entity88			2
mr @entity26 said this would place huge workloads on forces			0
in addition , he warned that re-arresting suspects and forcing them to provide new dna samples could ‘ constitute greater interference with their privacy ’ than holding on to samples that have already been taken			0
the watchdog said the legislation also meant ‘ difficulties have arisen ’ with retaining biometric data from criminals who have been convicted in @entity104 and @entity45 , which are different police jurisdictions			0
if a foreign criminal is arrested on suspicion of a crime in the @entity3 , details of previous offences can be secured from police forces elsewhere in @entity18			1
but mr @entity26 also warned that these can not be placed on the police ’s national computer database unless the suspect is convicted here			0
the news comes after the @entity116 revealed that foreigners accounted for one in seven crime suspects apprehended last year .			0
