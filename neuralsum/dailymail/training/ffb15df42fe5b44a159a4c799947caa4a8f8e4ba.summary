by @entity0 @entity2 hunters who fancy living the life of a @entity5 villain might consider a certain @entity7 apartment that comes complete with a secret room hidden behind a movable wall - that 's operated by a switch			1
it 's all very @entity13 - and you 'll need an a-lister 's salary to live there , with the landlord of the luxury @entity19 flat asking for a whopping £ 10,000 a week in rent			1
for that huge sum tenants will also get two bedrooms , both with en - suite bathrooms , and a huge lounge with views over @entity19 's @entity27			1
the secret room is a study that sits at the end of an enormous living room			0
it 's hidden by an artfully decorated wall that folds and opens up at the flick of a switch			0
the fifth - floor flat also has a separate one - bedroom annex suite for a @entity5 villain 's assistant while the apartment also has 24 - hour security			1
the flat , in @entity42 , @entity43 , is being advertised by @entity44 with the interior designed by @entity46			0

incredibly , a regular - sized bathroom - which covers around 32 sq / ft - will be worth £ 320,000			0
