home secretary @entity0 wants security services to be able to snoop on email and internet records , but @entity4 is seeking to delay the @entity5 water and power firms are being targeted by foreign countries launching cyber attacks against @entity10			1
the services ‘ upon which daily life depends ’ risk being disrupted by hackers working for the @entity10 's enemies , officials claimed			1
internet terrorism from ‘ hostile foreign states ’ is now one of the top four threats @entity10 faces			1
the scale of the problem comes as home secretary @entity0 stepped up her call for more powers to track email and internet use			1
she claimed people will ‘ die ’ without more powers to track terrorists , paedophiles and criminals online			1
a major @entity34 split was laid bare as mrs may took a swipe at @entity37 leader @entity4 for blocking new internet powers to break up criminal plots on sites like @entity41 and @entity42			1
the £ 2billion law – dubbed a snoopers charter - would store billions of pieces of private information from emails , @entity41 , texts and internet use			2
in a thinly - veiled swipe at her @entity52 colleague , mrs may said opponents of her legislation are ' putting politics before people ’s lives ’			2
mr @entity4 wants to delay the @entity5 until 2014 to strike a balance between security and liberty ’			1
but mrs may said : ‘ the people who say they ’re against this bill need to look victims of serious crime , terrorism and child sex offences in the eye and tell them why they ’re not prepared to give the police the powers they need to protect the public			1
‘ we would certainly see criminals going free as a result of this			0
there will be paedophiles who will not be identified and it will reduce our ability to deal with this serious organised crime , ’ she told @entity71 mrs may suggested the new laws were needed to prevent a repeat of the 7/7 @entity83 bombings or the shootings of two female police officers in @entity86 in september			0
‘ the shootings of @entity88 and @entity88 brought everybody up sharp to show the extent of the problem that can be caused by criminals			0
‘ it would be harder for us to crack into organised crime gangs , and yes we could see people dying as a result of not being able to have access to this information			0
’ mrs may said opponents of her @entity5 had to ' look victims of terrorism in the eye ' , like those caught up in the 7/7 @entity83 bombings she went on : ' criminals , terrorists and paedophiles will want mps to vote against this bill			1
' victims of crime , police and the public will want them to vote for it			2
it 's a question of whose side you 're on			2
' however , a committee of mps and peers is expected to issue damning criticism of the measures this week , arguing ministers have not made the case that is really needed			0
the @entity125 insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 months , along with use of @entity42 and even online games consoles , will protect national security			0
without it , police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time , they argue			0
officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images			2
gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data			0
the plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made , not what was said			0
the content of emails would also not be stored , just details of who sent and received them			0
in a separate move the government is warning critical infrastructure is being targeted by online terrorists			1
cabinet office minister @entity162 is publishing an update of the government 's cyber security strategy , including fresh measures to improve the @entity10 's ability to detect and defeat high - end threats ’			1
cyber attacks have been launched against the supplies ' upon which daily life depends , ' including power firms cabinet office minister @entity162 is warning companies they must become more ' cyber savvy ' systems controlling vital utilities like power and water supplies are being targeted , officials say			1
firms providing ‘ the essential services upon which daily life depends ’ have been attacked from abroad , an official told @entity183			2
the government is advising multi-national firms on how to prevent hackers disrupting supplies			1
mr @entity162 said the entire country needed to become more ‘ cyber savvy ’			2
he added : ‘ the internet transforms the risk we face			0
it is why we have rated attacks from cyberspace one of the top four threats to our national security			0
‘ we are in a race to build sufficient cyber defences to match the growing volume and dependence of our online economic , security and social interests			2
‘ it 's a race we can only win by working together : @entity165 , industry , academia and the public			0
this is as much a shared responsibility as a shared effort			0
’ earlier this year foreign secretary @entity211 and business secretary @entity212 called in the chairmen and chief executives of @entity216 companies for a briefing in the @entity218 to spell out the dangers including the online theft of valuable intellectual property and commercially sensitive information			0
at the same time ministers want to highlight the commercial potential of @entity10 's growing expertise in cyber security to boost exports around the world .			1
