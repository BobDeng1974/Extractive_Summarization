by @entity0 @entity1 : life , art and love by @entity5 this biography begins by stating that @entity1 is the best - loved and most quoted @entity8 poet of the past century			1
i doubt this claim is quite justified — what about @entity12 ? but what is true is that his reputation suffered after the publication of his letters in 1992 and @entity19 ’s ‘ official ’ biography in 1993			1
@entity1 had always appealed by being outspoken			1
two of his best - known lines are ‘ sexual intercourse began in 1963 ’ and ‘ they f * * * you up , your mum and dad ’			1
literary great @entity1 is often misunderstood in the 21st century according to biographer @entity5 they hardly do justice to his elusive , melancholy , often tender poems — his finer sensibilities were , in turn , contradicted by some of the rude , purposely philistine letters to friends such as @entity36 and @entity37			1
these were often meant as a joke			2
his @entity41 - ish comments on life ’s irritations sometimes included casual swipes at immigrants or expressions of warm approval for @entity48			1
his biography made it plain he kept at least two women , sometimes more , dangling without intending to marry anyone			2
suddenly , this favourite poet seemed , in private , to have been a selfish , foul - mouthed , lecher with a taste for pornography and racist remarks			1
i welcome the way this biography blows away this dark cloud , revealing that it was mainly composed of hot air , misunderstanding and the picky prejudices of ‘ political correctness ’ of the @entity67			2
we really need to know no more than the fact that all @entity1 ’s friends , lovers and colleagues consulted by @entity5 simply do not recognise the ‘ mr nasty ’ version of him			1
those close to him remembered him , without exception , as ‘ witty , entertaining , considerate and kind ’			2
surely some mistake has been perpetrated ? after all , the poems , gloomy though some of them are , could hardly have been written by what one critic called ‘ the vile mess that was @entity1 ’			1
he was an unusual type for a poet			2
his huge owl - like spectacles beneath a bulging bald dome , coupled with bicycle clips and an overlarge bike , hardly made for a romantic exterior			1
@entity1 wrote hundreds of heartfelt love letters to his mistress @entity94 , evidence he was not a misogynist he also had a bad stammer that made him shun public appearances and readings			1
it was thought puzzling that he spent his working life as a librarian — and most of that at the @entity104 , far from the centre of the literary scene			1
but nothing could have suited him better			2
he enjoyed his work , just as @entity109 enjoyed working in a bank			2
he was an efficient administrator , overseeing a magnificent new library			2
as for @entity112 , he liked its dullness ( ‘ very nice and flat for cycling ’ ) and inaccessibility at the end of the railway line : ‘ people ca n’t get at you ’			2
it suited him to be the hermit of @entity112 because he could get on with his poems			2
if this makes him sound a cheerless recluse , it was relieved by the almost wholly female library staff , for whom he was a lively and much - fancied boss			1
secretary @entity127 had a relationship with @entity1 for 18 years there is a photo in which @entity1 sits in front of two rows of eagerly smiling girl assistants			1
two of them became his mistresses			2
sexually , @entity1 was a late starter			1
he waited years for his first love , @entity138 , to grow out of her school days ; they reached sexual consummation as she took her finals			2
he got to the point of proposing to her , only to withdraw the proposal two days later , when he promptly departed to a new library job in @entity147			0
he wrote beautiful thank - you - and - goodbye letters — ‘ oh dear , oh dear , you were wonderful ’ or ‘ our two years were the most wonderful i ’ve known ’			1
you can almost hear the relief with which he used the past tense			0
his unyielding motive in love affairs was to avoid lifelong commitment			0
he was not , as some have suggested , a misogynist , but a misogamist , a hater of marriage — something inside refused to let him tie the knot			0
he suffered feelings of guilt because of it			0
at @entity166 he became entangled with a lecturer of flamboyant style called @entity94			0
her emphatic spectacles and intelligence matched his own			0
when new jobs separated them the affair carried on in the way he seemed to have preferred — by correspondence			0
he wrote hundreds of letters			1
when he got to @entity112 things were complicated by the addition of @entity181 , a library assistant who worshipped him			0
because of her strict @entity184 principles , she tried to stop short of pre-marital sex ( but seems to have yielded on occasion )			0
for years this triangle chimed uneasily on			0
he admitted he was a self - centred person ‘ conducting an affair with one girl , getting mixed up with another , heedless of the feelings of either ’			1
his excuse was that both women were dependent on him and ‘ kindness ’ stopped him dismissing either			0
‘ it is my unwillingness to give myself to anyone that ’s at fault — like promising to stand on one leg for the rest of your life ’			1
what was not at fault was his determination to put poetry before everything			0
for poetry he needed regular solitude			0
and from time to time most poets seek a fresh muse			0
both women knew of each other ’s existence , but neither wanted to be free of him			0
to this menage , he was to add a third			0
his relations with @entity127 , his secretary , had lasted 18 years when suddenly , in their 50s , it became physical — much to her surprise ( ‘ we were good buddies ’ )			0
@entity5 explores these emotional shifts and complexities fairly and sympathetically			1
why @entity1 should have been condemned for them beats me			1
all the women were free to leave , but they stayed close until he died			0
much of the book is about the finest of his poems , which @entity5 submits to technical analysis as well as appreciation , rather more of it perhaps than the general reader requires			0
as a man , @entity1 emerges by no means whiter than white			1
as he put it in a ‘ @entity244 ’ to @entity94 : ‘ @entity245 ! some day someone will perhaps explain what went wrong			0
i ca n’t believe i am so much more unpleasant than anyone else			0
’ he was n’t — and he is n’t now .			0

rude letters to friends @entity36 and @entity37 were misunderstood
casual swipes at immigrants and approval of @entity48 were misinterpreted in the politically correct *nineties*
@entity1 had an @entity41 - ish *outlook* on life *'s* irritations
@entity259 wrote beautiful thank - you - and - goodbye letters to his lovers
he was a man of unusal emotional complexity
