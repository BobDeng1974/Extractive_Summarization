@entity0 , the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular @entity3 pundit following @entity5 upset , has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level			1
@entity0 was due to address the @entity10 on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee			1
but an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the @entity15 persuading their @entity17 branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of @entity0 , who was giving his services free			1
the email from @entity21 , chairwoman of the @entity15 , read : ‘ a senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited @entity0 to be a guest speaker			1
it is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top - flight referees wo n’t send the right message to members			1
it may be perceived @entity15 agree with his viewpoint			2
’ @entity0 was invited to speak to the @entity10 regarding his battle against cancer however his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk @entity17 management then informed members : ‘ there was an agreement that we cancel @entity0 after pressure from the national @entity15 and the wider football world			1
’ and the @entity17 response to the @entity15 said : ‘ our irritation at having been placed in this position can not be underestimated			1
are we saying that as referees , we are above criticism ? ’ @entity53 refs chief @entity52 is president of the @entity15 but on monday night he denied any involvement			2
however , @entity0 ’s strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season			1
@entity64 rugby co-commentator @entity63 reacted to his perceived ‘ snub ’ at being one of the few tv pundits not included in @entity70 ’s giant @entity69 team by tweeting ‘ i ’ve been told i ’m too controversial for tv @entity69 coverage			2
too c * * * , i could take but controversial , b * * * * * * *			0
’ however , it was n’t @entity70 who told @entity63 he is controversial			0
the network , happy to employ the more volatile @entity76 as a football pundit , have had no contact with @entity63			1
@entity64 rugby co-commentator @entity63 vented his frustration at being snubbed by @entity70 on @entity81 @entity82 bid blunder @entity85 presidential candidate @entity84 says , if elected , he intends to cut costs — something he ’s never heard mentioned during six years of dealings with @entity89 , where figures are just plucked out of the air , he claimed			0
@entity82 will also declare what his @entity85 salary would be and wants to know what @entity94 has been paid			0
the @entity97 football leader , who has a budget of € 400,000 from his national association for his campaign , is also concerned at the way @entity102 were given the rights to the @entity69 in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a @entity69 in @entity106			1
yet all @entity82 ’s good intentions are undone by his open offer to @entity94 , who he says could carry on as a working honorary president concentrating on the @entity111 funding			0
meanwhile , @entity113 contender @entity112 is rich enough to fund his own campaign but this most charismatic of footballers could n’t be more dull when he talks @entity85 politics			0
@entity84 , pictured with @entity118 in 2014 , has said he will cut costs if he replaces @entity94 @entity94 is said to be so confident of winning a fifth term that he feels no need to mount any form of campaign and is addressing the @entity124 on tuesday in his @entity85 president ’s slot rather than as a candidate			0
however , the 79 - year - old is understood to have engaged well - known @entity130 pr figure @entity129 to advise him on his election strategy			2
@entity129 , former tv journalist and political author , founded his own pr and consulting business in 1982 and is a long - time friend of @entity94 ’s			0
@entity85 president @entity94 is confident of beating off competition from the likes of @entity82 to win a fifth term for all the shenanigans , scandals and infighting at the @entity53 over the years , at least there ’s never been such an unseemly episode as @entity145 ’s @entity85 executive member @entity144 reporting his successor as @entity148 federation president @entity147 to @entity85 ’s ethics committee over alleged pay and pension irregularities			0
it is a blatant attempt by @entity144 to stop @entity147 taking his executive seat			0
@entity85 have cleared @entity147 and @entity124 general secretary @entity154 said @entity144 ’s claims had been fully rejected , adding : ‘ it ’s all a bit embarrassing for him and sad for @entity148 football			2
’ @entity147 said : ‘ i have not heard of a similar story anywhere in football			2
’ @entity144 ( left ) reported @entity147 ( right ) to @entity85 's ethics committee over pay irregularities			0
