talented southpaw @entity0 was sent back to the drawing board as he was methodically bludgeoned to a split decision loss by classy @entity4 welterweight champion @entity3 in @entity5			1
the unbeaten @entity7 star looked out of his depth early on as @entity10 ’s vast experience and technical aptitude saw him a step ahead			0
@entity0 seemed to find his feet in the early middle rounds but was floored by a body shot in the sixth and despite showing huge heart and flashes of skill , never recovered en route to a first professional loss which could have been much wider			1
beaten : @entity3 is crowned the winner after ending @entity0 's unbeaten record on friday @entity0 , the only @entity24 to ever win a world amateur title , was making the step up having already established himself as the @entity28 and @entity29 champion and in truth had his long - term sights set on world honours			1
however , victory at the @entity34 was far from a foregone conclusion for the 19 - 0 prospect ( @entity37 wins )			0
@entity10 , born in @entity38 but based in @entity39 , boasted a proud unbeaten record of 30 wins and two draws on his ledger coming in , and the 39 - year - old ’s tally of just 11 early wins did not do him @entity47 lost the first three rounds as @entity10 landed the more effective shots			1
the local man was finding @entity4 waters deeper than he had anticipated but showed signs - albeit too fleetingly - that the task might not be beyond him			0
the fourth was by far his best as he calmed himself down and kept his composure			0
but he was down in the sixth from a crushing right to the body which saw him crumple to the canvas			0
he dug deep , however , to rise with the count at nine and see the bell			0
blow : @entity0 was convinced he had won but is now hoping to rebuild and fight for the @entity4 title once more @entity10 sensed blood and waged war with @entity0 , cut around one eye , under heavy fire but roared on by a partisan midlands crowd			1
the end looked imminent but again @entity0 survived			2
@entity70 referee @entity69 should arguably have stopped the fight as the onslaught went on but @entity0 somehow survived into the ninth			1
he may have even won the last three rounds - the last was perhaps his best - before scores of 114 - 113 by two judges , against 117 - 115 to @entity0 by their colleague , ensured @entity10 kept his crown and added @entity0 ’s @entity29 belt			2
' i ’m gutted , ' said @entity0			1
' i thought i won it and even @entity3 told me i ’d won			0
i have n’t lost a fight in nine years as an amateur or pro so it ’s hard to take			2
' but hopefully he ’ll vacate the belt and fight for a world title and i can rebuild and fight for the @entity4 again			0
