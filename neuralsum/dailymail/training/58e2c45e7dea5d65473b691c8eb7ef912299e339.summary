world leaders were today urged to focus on growth more than budget cuts this year as fears deepened that recession in @entity5 will slow the global economy			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) predicts global growth of 3.25 per cent in 2012 , slower than the 4 per cent it projected in september			2
in turn , the 17 nations that share the euro will shrink 0.5 per cent this year , compared to its forecast for 1.1 per cent growth four months ago			0
@entity17 outlook : @entity19 chancellor @entity18 ( left ) and @entity21 's economy minister @entity20 ( right ) at a meeting where they rejected an offer from @entity26 's creditors to help restructure its debts @entity5 's recession should only have a modest impact on the @entity30 , which the @entity7 believes will grow by 1.8 per cent growth over the same period , unchanged from its september estimate			1
but the global - lending organisation warns against steep budget cuts , which it says will slow growth further and undermine market confidence , running against the push for budget cuts advocated by @entity41 chancellor @entity40			0
it comes as the single currency fell back from three - week highs and world stocks stumbled today as the latest setback in efforts to restructure @entity26 debt triggered more worries about the outlook for the region			1
oil prices also fell as investors focused on the chances of a @entity26 debt default that could hit energy demand			2
@entity58 finance ministers rejected as insufficient an offer made by private creditors to help restructure @entity26 's debts when they met in @entity62 today , sending negotiators back to the drawing board and raising the threat of a disorderly @entity26 default			1
' it 's back to worrying about whether @entity26 is heading for a soft , messy or technical default , ' @entity67 , chief market economist at @entity68 in @entity69 , said			1
welcome break : @entity41 chancellor @entity40 makes a face as she reacts to a performance by carnivalists from @entity76 in a traditional ceremony today in the line - up : @entity40 talks to dancers after their performance at the @entity81 in @entity82 the euro last traded at $ 1.2964 against the @entity30 dollar on tuesday , a fall of 0.49 per cent			0
in its @entity86 , the @entity7 said that in light of weaker growth @entity88 governments should avoid extreme austerity measures such as spending cuts and tax increases			2
and healthier @entity88 countries whose governments are facing lower interest rates ' should reconsider the pace ' of their short - term budget cuts			0
@entity7 managing director @entity100 made a similar argument on monday during a speech in @entity82			2
@entity88 banks , meanwhile , are cutting back on lending in order to boost their capital reserves , the fund said			0
that 's likely to hammer @entity110 and @entity88 economies this year , which depend heavily on @entity88 bank loans			0
the cutbacks will also slow growth in many @entity115 economies , the @entity7 said , where @entity88 banks finance a big chunk of the region 's exports			1
still , the hit to @entity120 will be relatively modest - it is forecast to grow 8.2 per cent this year , down from the fund 's earlier projection of 9 per cent			1
@entity30 policymakers should take steps to rein in the long - term costs of government health programs and @entity127 , the federal public pension system , the @entity7 said			1
but those cuts should be phased in over the long - term			0
immediate cuts could slow the economy further			0
no to cuts : the @entity7 's @entity86 echoed a speech made by its president @entity100 ( above ) yesterday when she said @entity88 governments should avoid extreme austerity measures in light of weaker growth one reason the @entity7 expects the @entity30 economy to remain sluggish is because governments at all levels will likely cut back on spending			1
the @entity7 assumes the @entity127 payroll tax and extended unemployment benefits will be extended for the full year			2
last month , @entity145 agreed to extend them only through february			0
without a full extension of both measures , the @entity30 economy will fare much worse , the @entity7 said			1
@entity100 warned yesterday that the world economy faced the risk of a painful recession this year			1
she called on policymakers to avoid the stalemates that prevented @entity5 and the @entity30 from resolving difficult budget and economic problems last year			2
' it is not about saving any one country or any one region , ' she said			0
' it is about saving the world from a downward economic spiral			0
' the @entity7 's projections followed a similar mark - down in global growth estimates last week by the @entity165 .			0
