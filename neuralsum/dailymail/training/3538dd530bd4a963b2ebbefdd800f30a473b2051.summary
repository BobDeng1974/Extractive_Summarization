the world ’s first enzymes made from artificial genetic material have been created by scientists in what could be a major step towards generating synthetic life			1
the enzymes , which do not occur naturally , were created using a synthetic form of dna called @entity10 and were capable of triggering chemical reactions in the lab. the findings build on previous work that showed six types of @entity10 molecules were capable of storing and transmitting genetic information in the same way as @entity9 and @entity19			1
it had been previously thought that @entity9 and @entity19 , which form the basis for all life on @entity23 , were the only way of storing genetic material			1
double stranded dna ( above ) and single stranded @entity19 were thought to be the only basic building blocks for life but scientists have shown that other molecules called @entity29 can not only store genetic information but also catalyse biological reactions that are used to edit the genetic material within cells but now the latest research by synthetic biologists in @entity36 shows that this synthetic genetic material is also capable of performing another crucial biological role - catalysing biochemical reactions that are essential for life			1
using their lab - made @entity29 as building blocks , the team were able to create synthetic enzymes , which they have named ‘ @entity46 ’ , that could cut up and stitch together small chunks of genetic material , just like naturally occurring enzymes			1
the suggests that such molecules could be used to replicate some of the earliest steps needed to produce life itself and may even provide clues about what life on other planets may be like			2
in truth , no body really knows , but the work conducted by scientists at the @entity61 in @entity36 can provide some clues			0
they were able to create sequences of @entity10 that they could use to hold genetic information , copy it into strands of dna and then copy back to a new @entity10			1
this is very similar to the behaviour of viruses , which transfer genetic information into cells , hijack the host dna and then create more copies of themselves			2
however , if life on other planets used this approach , it would still require dna to help them replicate			0
but the molecular machinery needed to do this would look unlike anything here on @entity23			0
the researchers had to create a specially engineered enzyme to get this reaction to occur - one that does not occur anywhere in nature , on @entity23 at least			1
yet the scientists have also created @entity10 molecules that can assemble and fold themselves up spontaneously - much like naturally occurring dna			1
their most recent work shows @entity10 can also behave like enzymes to trigger biochemical reactions			2
this raises the prospect that @entity10 could also begin to replicate itself , a crucial step in creating organisms			2
@entity10 has been shown to be far stronger and stable than dna and so could result in life that is much more robust than here on @entity23			1
however , the tiny errors and mutations that occur when @entity9 is damaged are also essential for driving evolution			0
this would mean that in an @entity10 - world , life would evolve far slower than on @entity23 and could still be fairly basic			1
it is thought that life first began with the evolution of a segment of @entity19 that was able to copy itself and catalyse reactions			2
if @entity10 is also capable of this , then it could also have led to different forms of life on other planets or could be used to create new synthetic forms of life			1
however , dr @entity120 , who led the research at the @entity61 in @entity36 , said : ‘ our work suggests that , in principle , there are a number of possible alternatives to nature 's molecules that will support the catalytic processes required for life			0
‘ until recently , it was thought that @entity9 and @entity19 were the only molecules that could store genetic information and , together with proteins , the only biomolecules able to form enzymes			1
‘ @entity137 ' of @entity19 and dna may just be an accident of prehistoric chemistry			0
' the creation of synthetic dna , and now enzymes , from building blocks that do n't exist in nature also raises the possibility that if there is life on other planets it may have sprung up from an entirely different set of molecules , and widens the possible number of planets that might be able to host life			1
’ in 2012 dr @entity120 ’s group showed that there were six alternative molecules to the oligonucleotides that form rna and dna , which they called @entity29			1
they demonstrated that these could store information and could even evolve through natural selection			0
in their latest research , which is published in the journal nature , the team created four different types of synthetic enzyme from strands of @entity10			2
these @entity46 were able to perform the role of a polymerase - an enzyme that cuts and joins @entity19 strands together - in a test tube			0
one of the @entity46 they created was also able to join @entity10 strands together to form longer molecules - a key step towards creating a living system that can replicate itself			2
although it will still be some time before these can be used to create living synthetic organisms , dr @entity120 believes that @entity46 could also be useful for developing new therapies for range of diseases including cancers and some viral infections			2
dr @entity120 added : ‘ our @entity29 are chemically extremely robust and , because they do not occur in nature , they are not recognised by the body 's natural degrading enzymes			0
‘ this might make them an attractive candidate for long - lasting treatments that can disrupt disease - related rnas			0
’ professor @entity197 , chair of the @entity61 's @entity198 , said the work could kick start an entirely new branch of medicine			0
two of the @entity10 enzymes created by the scientists at the @entity61 in @entity36 , which were able to join two strands of @entity10 together ( left ) and cut up strands of @entity19 ( right ) life on other planets outside our own solar system , like this exoplanet , could have evolved from @entity10 rather than @entity19 , which could have led to very different forms of life to those we are familiar with here on @entity23 he said : ‘ synthetic biology is delivering some truly amazing advances that promise to change the way we understand and treat disease			1
‘ this latest advance offers the tantalising prospect of using designer biological parts as a starting point for an entirely new class of therapies and diagnostic tools that are more effective and have a longer shelf - life			0
’ professor @entity230 , a @entity231 winner at @entity232 who studies the origins of life , added that the research raises some fundamental questions about what life on other planets may be like			0
he told @entity239 : ‘ the possibility that life elsewhere , on exoplanets , could have started with something other than rna or dna is quite interesting			0
‘ but the primordial biopolymer for any form of life must satisfy other constraints as well , such as being something that can be generated by prebiotic chemistry and replicated efficiently			0
‘ @entity10 can satisfy these constraints , as well as providing useful functions , remains an open question			0

synthetic form of dna , called @entity10 , is capable of editing genetic material
@entity10 triggered reactions thought to be crucial for life first starting on @entity23
scientists suggest alien life could have evolved using @entity10 instead of dna
artificial molecules could also be used to create synthetic life in the lab
researchers believe @entity10 may lead to a new ways of treating cancers
