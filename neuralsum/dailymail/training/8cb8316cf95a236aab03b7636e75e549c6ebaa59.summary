a wearable drone that is worn on the wrist has won a prestigious wearable contest run by chip giant @entity3			1
called @entity5 , the drone folds up and attaches to a wrist strap , and is the world 's first wearable drone			1
when the wearer wants it to start filming , they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead , tracking their movements using motion sensors			1
@entity5 is a drone , worn on the wrist ( concept illustrated ) and expands at the touch of a button			1
the team has created a prototype version and recently received $ 50,000 ( £ 30,700 ) in funding last week , @entity33 and @entity34 both released details about handheld devices set to rival @entity37			2
the former is planning to release the @entity39 - a tiny action camera with a square design			2
and a teaser video and leaked images reveal that @entity34 is planning to release a similar device of its own , in the shape of a toy periscope			0
the @entity39 will be available for £ 89 ( $ 99.99 ) from 1 october			0
@entity34 's camera is due to launch next month			1
the drone then returns to the wearer 's wrist , which could be controlled using a timer , or summoned using gestures			1
it was developed by dr @entity54 , a physics researcher at @entity21 , with colleagues @entity55 and @entity57			2
today , the drone won @entity3 's annual make it wearable competition			1
as a result , the team has been awarded $ 500,000 to help make it a reality			0
' we are very happy , humbled and really honoured , ' @entity55 of @entity5 told @entity65			2
' we have all the core functionality of the drone - we 've solved all of the hardest challenges , we have stable wristbands that can unfold and are stable in flight , and navigation is solved			0
' the next stage is that we have half a million dollars , and we want to make it real			0
' @entity55 said the final product will be ' safe , beautiful and intuitive ' ' @entity76 will target people who do adventure sports like rock climbers , we are offering a lot of value - and we think will be a bit more expensive that a @entity37			0
' ultimately we want to target the point and shoot camera market , and we want to be in than range			1
' we hope we can revive the camera market			1
' in addition to the prize money , all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the @entity93 - based tech giant			0
dr @entity54 has also created an early prototype , which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year			0
' @entity5 is a tiny wearable camera on a wrist band , ' the firm said			1
' the wrist straps unfold to create a quadcopter that flies , takes photos or video , then comes back to you			2
' @entity5 is in development			2
stay tuned ! ' second prize winner , @entity105 was awarded $ 200,000 , using low cost , high efficiency @entity113 printing and scanning to bring customized products to amputees for less than $ 1,000			0
third prize winner and recipient of $ 100,000 , @entity114 is offering an enterprise invention that seeks to reduce physical work stress , improve ergonomics and reduce costly workplace mistakes when the wearer wants it to start filming , they press a button and the drone unfolds ( illustrated ) and flies overhead , tracking their movements using motion sensors			1
the drone then returns to the wearer 's wrist , which could be controlled using a timer , or summoned using gestures the @entity136 drone is a cross between a @entity37 action camera ( @entity139 pictured left ) and a traditional quadcopter ( stock image pictured right ) other finalists include the @entity144 sports and activity necklace , a wrist - worn air conditioning unit , and a production glove			1
make it wearable is a year - long contest , open to students over the age of 13 , designers , engineers , and makers			2
ceo @entity155 in january launched the ' make it @entity157 ' contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use @entity3 's chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology			1
the prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market			0
' this was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn , ' @entity155 said at an award event on monday			0
' the real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas			0
' finalists included a pad that lets premature babies in incubators feel the heartbeat of their mothers , and a necklace that uses patterns of pulses felt on the chest to give cyclists turn - by - turn directions so they do n't need to look at their smartphones			0
@entity21 and physics researcher dr @entity54 has also created an early prototype , ( pictured ) which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year			1
it is unknown when the @entity5 will go on sale , and how much it will retail for , but @entity65 has contacted the firm for more information @entity201 , @entity202 and other technology companies are rolling out growing numbers of smart watches and fitness bands , but the wearable category has yet to gain major traction with consumers			1
@entity210 plans to roll out a smartwatch in 2015			0
@entity3 , whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers , this year bought health tracker startup basis			2
it also has teamed up on other wrist - worn gadgets with @entity218 and @entity219			2
@entity155 , a weekend tinkerer who restored a 1974 @entity220 in his free time , is betting that other hobbyists have as much chance as major technology companies of dreaming up compelling wearable computing gadgets			0
in addition to the prize money , all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the @entity93 - based tech giant			0
the winner of @entity3 's competition will be announced on 3 november			1
this illustration reveals where the camera on the @entity136 drone is positioned to that end , @entity3 launched @entity239 , a tiny computer packaged in an sd - card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products			1
earlier this year , @entity247 unveiled the first ' pet ' drone that automatically follows its owner - and could change the way sports are filmed			2
it is not wearable , like @entity5 , but the @entity255 drone can be fitted with a @entity37 camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports , tracking everything from skateboarders to @entity262 riders			1
@entity263 tracks and follow users and their trajectory , and has a flight time of up to 15 minutes			0
it can also reach speeds of 40mph ( 64km/h )			0
to use @entity263 , a programmable remote is strapped to the wrist or helmet , and it is likely to retail for $ 995 ( £ 612 ) .			0

the @entity275 wearable drone was created by researchers at @entity21
won @entity3 's annual make it wearable competition
@entity5 is a drone , worn on the wrist and expands at the touch of a button
it flies off , filming its owner using a camera , and tracking their movements
firm hopes it could *reinvigorate* the point and shoot camera market
