by @entity0 published : 04:18 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 08:46 est , 4 december 2012 ' furious ' : @entity1 is said to be angry at @entity2 plans to build a new stretch of 150ft pylons near her home in the @entity7 countryside tv star @entity1 has backed a campaign to prevent a row of huge pylons being built across an exclusive ‘ millionaires ’ row ’ where she owns a property			1
@entity1 presenter @entity1 , 51 , is furious that @entity2 has opted to route high - voltage power lines across the street , near @entity7			1
the private road is home to several multi-million properties and the wealthy residents have now launched a ‘ fighting fund ’ to campaign against the pylons			1
@entity1 ’s agent @entity24 , who also lives in the road near @entity26 - in - @entity27 , is head of the residents ’ association and is spearheading the campaign			1
he says the 150ft high pylons will be an eyesore and carry significant health risks			1
mr @entity24 - who also represents @entity34 and @entity35 - wants the 400,000 volt cables underground , which @entity2 says is too expensive			2
he said : ' they want to put these 150ft high pylons everywhere , which will spoil the countryside			1
' they should just dig it underground or link it with another cable they are burying not too far away			2
' i think that it is selfish of the energy company for using pylons - they were invented in 1926			2
' we have made huge advances in how to transport electricity since then but it is poor for @entity2 to say it is limited by the cost			2
' how can you put a value on people ’s health ? ' the energy giant needs to erect 37 miles of new power lines from the @entity61 nuclear power station which is currently being constructed at @entity62 near @entity63 , @entity64 , to @entity65 near @entity7			1
at risk : @entity1 has joined residents who say the 150ft power lines will ruin the countryside around their properties near @entity7 the road already has a 132,000 volt power line running across it which is suspended from 88ft pylons			1
but residents had hoped the new bigger pylons would be routed elsewhere or underground as @entity2 was considering two different routes for the new cables			0
however , last month it announced its chosen route would run directly over the lane			0
@entity1 owns one of the 44 homes on the secluded road and spoke out against the plans when they were first announced in 2008			0
she said : ' clearly there are engineering challenges to placing cables under the sea bed but it is striking that , in the 21st century , @entity2 has not put forward a proposal for bringing the cables from @entity61 to @entity65 using the @entity92			0
' @entity24 estimates the cost of burying the cables underground would work out as an extra £ 8 on customers ’ annual bills nationwide			0
he said : ' i am sure that everyone in this area would agree to have a little more on their energy bills to get this line underground			0
' this is not just about fighting for the residents but everyone affected by this new power line			1
' but if @entity2 thinks we are just a small group of people it can ride roughshod over , it is very much mistaken			0
' contested : the existing power line ( yellow ) will be removed but the proposed new line of pylons ( purple ) will run directly over a road where @entity1 owns a property he added : ' it may cost millions to put the 400kv line underground but that will be very cheap compared to the hassle you will get from us , legally or illegally			1
' we will give you absolute hell and you will be better off looking at some alternatives			0
' campaigning : @entity1 's agent @entity24 , who also lives on the same road , is leading residents in opposing @entity2 plans to build the new power lines however , @entity2 says the cost of burying the entire route underground would be £ 1.5billion - twice the £ 75million of its current proposed mechanism			1
overhead cable cost around £ 1.24 million per mile , whereas an underground cable costs between £ 9.4 and £ 11.2 million per mile			0
@entity2 ’s draft route includes burying five miles of cables underground across the @entity140			0
spokeswoman @entity141 said : ' all the emissions from the electro - magnetic forces from the lines are monitored			1
' there are statutory limits on that which are set by the government and all our equipment does operate within those limits			0
' the connection we have to build is a transmission line to move very big amount of electricity across a very long distance			2
' we are proposing to take down the 132,000v line from @entity158 to @entity159 in @entity65 and build a 400,000v connection			2
' the connection will include five miles of underground cable through the @entity140 and will result in 95 fewer pylons along the route			0
' residents have until december 18 to make comments on the draft route before formal plans are lodged with the planners .			0
