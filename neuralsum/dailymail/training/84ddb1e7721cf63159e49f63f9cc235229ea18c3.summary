unfortunately for @entity22 , he was spotted hanging out of the property ’s window enjoying a post-passion cigarette			1
passion : the building ( centre ) containing the flat where @entity10 brought down drapes and made the bed collapse			2
the betting shop was not thought to be involved amorous : @entity22 's bed collapsed when he sneaked into his old flat in @entity38 , @entity15 ( pictured )			1
a court heard it was the best he and his partner could do without offending public decency police visited the flat in @entity38 after neighbours heard ' noises ' , @entity15 magistrates heard			2
