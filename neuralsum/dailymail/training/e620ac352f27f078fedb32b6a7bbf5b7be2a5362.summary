by @entity0 for the @entity1 but @entity2 , who has not posted anything on his account since may , has now returned - with his first tweets apologising to his fans for the stories regarding his tax avoidance , followed by a vow to ' settle things ' up till now he has kept rather quiet about the controversy surrounding his financial dealings			1
but @entity2 has finally broken his four - month silence over his tax avoidance with an apology … and a plug for his new album			1
the @entity19 singer was accused of ‘ cynicism ’ as he addressed the issue in a series of messages to his 3.5million @entity25 followers			2
@entity2 said he was sorry ‘ to anyone who was offended by the tax stories ’			1
but some fans said it fell short of heartfelt contrition as he did not express regret for the fact he failed to pay tax			2
and alongside the cursory apology , he announced that the band have been working on a new record			0
earlier this year it was revealed the 43 - year - old , his bandmates @entity40 , 46 , and @entity41 , 42 , and their manager @entity42 face a multimillion - pound tax bill for attempting to shelter £ 66million in a tax - avoidance scheme called @entity45			1
days after the revelations , @entity2 ’s @entity25 account was hacked by someone who wrote an offensive post about his stillborn baby , prompting him to stay off the social networking site			1
returning to @entity25 for the first time since may 7 , the star said : ‘ hey everyone ! i ’m back from seven productive weeks in the @entity55 and i ’m back on @entity25 ! i ’ve had a break from @entity25 after someone hacked my account and some very upsetting and disturbing text was written			1
‘ over the summer i ’ve remembered that i have so many supporters , friends and fans on here so why let 1 person ruin all the fun			2
‘ i want to apologise to anyone who was offended by the tax stories earlier this year			0
with a new team of accountants we are working to settle things with all parties involved asap			1
’ @entity2 , who has not posted anything on his account since may , has now returned - with his first tweets apologising to his fans for the stories regarding his tax avoidance , followed by a vow to ' settle things ' last night , mps welcomed the apology , but said it should have come sooner and questioned whether he would now pay back the tax he managed to avoid through the @entity45 scheme			1
@entity87 mp @entity86 said : ‘ there is no free pass for people who abuse our tax system			0
increasingly they will be found out , have to pay their fair share and risk public anger to boot			0
it ’s welcome to see @entity2 putting his hand up			2
' but he could have held it up a little higher and sooner than he has			0
’ @entity100 mp @entity99 added : ‘ we all look forward to him confirming that he will pay back all the tax that he avoided			0
’ and moments after the posts about his tax affairs , @entity2 started plugging his new ventures : ‘ we have been working since the new year on a new @entity19 studio album			1
bandmates : @entity2 with @entity40 in a picture on @entity25 ' we are extremely excited about it ! it has been four long years since the last one			1
it ’s so nice to be back in the band ! ’ many of @entity2 ’s fans reacted positively to his statement , with one saying : ‘ you ’re only human and we all make mistakes			1
’ but others questioned the timing of his apology			0
one said it was ‘ hollow ’ and ‘ non-committal ’ , adding : ‘ only sorry coz [ sic ] he was named and shamed			0
timing is to drum up interest for upcoming album			0
’ another added : ‘ i was n’t offended by the stories , i was offended by you not paying tax , @entity133			0
because i have a moral compass			0
’ @entity2 ’s investment in @entity45 was first revealed in 2012			2
this year , a tax judge decided it was ‘ known and understood by all concerned to be a tax avoidance scheme ’			1
it allowed the @entity19 members to avoid tax on around £ 63million made through world tours and cd sales			2
there is no suggestion that the other band members , @entity147 and @entity148 , invested in the @entity45 schemes .			0

@entity2 left @entity25 after his account was hacked in and a *deeply* offensive message was posted about his stillborn child
hackers *targeted* him following news he **'d** invested in tax avoidance scheme
but @entity2 , who has *n't* posted on his account since may , has returned
he vowed to fans he **'d** ' settle things with all parties involved asap '
@entity2 and bandmates @entity40 , @entity41 , and their manager @entity42 , poured £ 66million into @entity166
