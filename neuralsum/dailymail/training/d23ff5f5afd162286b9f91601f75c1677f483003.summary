the @entity0 has announced proposals to cut the number of players from outside the @entity4 coming into the @entity6 game by up to 50 per cent			0
some 122 overseas players were granted visas between 2009 and 2013 , 23 of them in the @entity9			1
the @entity0 is proposing only @entity11 clubs be allowed to sign @entity13 players , and also be prevented from sending them out on loan , as part of a number of changes recommended by @entity0 chairman @entity20 's @entity19			2
@entity21 , who joined @entity22 in 2009 , would not have been granted a permit under the proposed rules @entity20 's @entity19 suggested the changes which would limit the number of @entity13 players furthermore , only players from the top 50 - ranked countries in the world could be signed unless the transfer fee is more than a fixed figure , either £ 10million or £ 15million			1
an @entity0 statement said : ' the defined criteria are designed to result in visas only for those elite sportspeople who are internationally established at the highest level [ and ] whose employment will make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at the highest level in the @entity41			0
' the appeals system would also be toughened up so that clubs can only appeal on the basis of incorrect process - currently nearly 80 % of all appeals are successful and tribunals are often asked to make subjective judgments on playing ability			2
the ruling would apply to all players from @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , the @entity56 , and @entity57 who do not hold @entity4 passports			0
@entity59 would have not been given a permit as he arrived from a nation outside the top 50 for £ 7m @entity62 joined @entity63 last summer under the old system despite having only played for @entity52 twice at the time the proposals are contained in an @entity0 consultative paper - which it is required to produce under @entity68 rules - and it will now hold talks with the @entity11 , @entity9 , @entity71 , @entity72 and the national fas of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
one change would make it slightly easier for the best @entity13 players to gain work permits by reducing from 75 per cent to 30 per cent the number of competitive international matches that @entity13 players from countries in the top 30 must have played in the previous two years			1
the system , called the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) process , was introduced by the @entity68 in 2008 to allow sports governing bodies to each manage a system for endorsing visa applications of elite players from @entity13 countries .			0

23 overseas players given work permits outside @entity11 since 2009
players from countries ranked lower than 50th in the world would have to cost more than £ 10million to get a work permit under new proposals
appeals system to be *tightened* to *ensure* only the elite are allowed in
but international games criteria to be lowered from 75 % to just 30 %
