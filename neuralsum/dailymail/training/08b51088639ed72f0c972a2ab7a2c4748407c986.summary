by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 03:58 est , 13 july 2012 as the strong winds blow across the vast sandy expanse , the future of the ancient fossils residing in a @entity4 desert are in jeopardy			1
geologists have spent the past few years painstakingly exploring the vast whale cemetery which dates back millions of years , but today the biggest threat to the ancient find is a battle against the abrasive elements			2
the fossilised remains of roughly 15 of the majestic marine mammals were discovered in the @entity17 desert some 310 kilometers ( 190 miles ) south of the capital @entity19			1
painstaking work : an archeologist brushes the fossilized jaw of a whale lying on the desert pavement of @entity25 , 310 km south of @entity19 slice of history : the delicate remains of roughly 15 of the marine mammals are currently on view in the @entity17 desert alive three to 20 million years ago , they were once submerged but are now situated some 30 kilometers from the shore			1
the area has been shaken by volcanic eruptions , killing off all life forms , according to experts from the country 's geology and mining institute @entity40 who have been working for four years at the site			0
' the strong winds throughout the year in the area are the worst enemy of the fossils , ' said @entity46 , who heads the team during a tour of the site , which spans 45 square kilometers ( 17 square miles )			1
battling the elements : ' the strong winds throughout the year in the area are the worst enemy of the fossils , ' said @entity46 , who heads the team now , plans are underway to create a paleontological park that would include finds from this sandswept stretch , which mr @entity46 says could still contain an even larger treasure trove			1
' there is probably a greater number of fossils in the sand but it takes high - tech equipment to locate and recover them , ' he said			0
' the bodies were preserved by the low level of oxygen in the substrate , which delayed decay caused by bacteria			0
' excavation work so far has yielded some impressive results			0
in february , experts located the remains of a minke whale that is believed to be 3.6 million years old			1
armed with brushes and chisels , and braving intense heat , they unearthed the animal 's head -- spanning 1.8 meters -- that had fossilized on a rock			0
' it is a species known only in @entity4 , ' mr @entity46 said , estimating that the whale weighed about 500 kilograms ( 1,100 pounds ) and measured six meters in length			2
history uncovered : the fossilised spinal column of whale lie - today , wind is the main force removing the debris hiding these scientific treasures in what could be a paleontological park in the future the specimen , protected so as not to damage it , is due to be transferred to the local municipality of @entity25 , he added			0
work would then continue on the rest of the remains			0
mr @entity46 recalled how in 2008 researchers found remains of a sperm whale ( @entity104 ) that were 12 million years old			1
the animal is believed to have been between 16 and 20 meters long			0
preservation : a close up photo reveals the fossilised spinal column of whale ' the sperm whale is a prehistoric animal considered to be one of the largest known marine predators that had about 70 teeth of 36 centimeters each and fed on minke whales coming into the bay to mate , ' he said			2
the remains of the skull , jaw and teeth of the animal , which together weighed more than a ton , are on display at the @entity125 at the @entity126 in @entity19			0
a decade ago , mr @entity46 came across the jaw and three - meter skull of a giant shark , considered a mega predator , that lived off the @entity4 coast			2
the fossilised remains of roughly 15 of the majestic marine mammals were discovered in the @entity17 desert some 310 kilometers ( 190 miles ) south of the capital lima while locals are being urged to tread carefully while walking in the excavation area , plans to create a paleontological park are taking shape			1
@entity142 head @entity141 said that the government agency is coordinating with @entity17 mayor @entity144 to develop a draft proposal to be presented to @entity146			2
in addition , she said , four experts were working on a geological map spanning 370 kilometers of the @entity17 desert			1
it would pinpoint , among other things , the location of the fossils and areas where it is safe for the public to walk , according to @entity46 .			0
