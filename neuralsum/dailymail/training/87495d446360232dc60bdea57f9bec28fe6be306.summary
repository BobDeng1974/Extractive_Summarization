@entity0 beat relegation threatened @entity2 at @entity3 thanks to a second half double from @entity6 international @entity5			1
@entity5 opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 66th minute before doubling the hosts lead with just six minutes left			1
@entity2 had defender @entity10 wrongfully sent off during the game as the former @entity0 defender wrongly took the flak for a poor @entity15 foul			1
here , @entity17 's @entity16 rates every player 's performance at @entity3 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity20 6 – little more than a spectator for the most part but pulled off a smart save from @entity23 early on			2
@entity24 6.5 – solid in defence , purposeful going forward			0
a good performance without setting the world alight			0
@entity0 's @entity28 battles for the ball with @entity2 's @entity30 at @entity3 @entity31 gets his foot to the ball ahead of @entity0 defender @entity34 at @entity3 @entity34 6 – got forward a few times to launch @entity0 attacks in the absence of much creativity from his midfielders			1
@entity41 5 – booed on a couple of occasions by the @entity0 fans for passing back to his goalkeeper and needs to be a little more positive , even for a centre - back			2
@entity28 6 – kept @entity48 quiet down the @entity2 right and made one vital interception to deny the former @entity6 man in the first half			1
striker @entity23 uses his strength to hold off @entity0 right back @entity24 @entity53 5.5 – played alongside @entity54 at the base of a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 but made very little impact on the game			1
had a goal ruled out for offside towards the end			0
@entity61 6.5 – @entity63 competent , tidy job from the @entity64			0
tested @entity65 with a decent effort from range in the second half			0
@entity69 4 – his worst performance for @entity0 yet			1
took the wrong option time and again , and not one of his tricks came off			0
hooked at half - time			2
@entity69 again struggled to live up to the hype as the @entity76 found himself hauled off at half time @entity5 7.5 – @entity0 skipper had to be happy with a deeper role again , but lifted his side from a lethargic performance by scoring both goals			1
@entity83 6.5 – @entity0 ’s biggest threat in the first half and was unlucky to see one goalbound effort deflected against the underside of the bar			2
@entity89 6 – earned the penalty for @entity0 and an ovation from the fans when he was subbed immediately afterwards			2
plenty of effort from the @entity97 bit the cutting edge is still lacking			0
@entity5 scored from the spot as @entity0 earned all three points against @entity2 @entity2 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity101 6 – not tested nearly enough in the first half			1
made some good saves after the interval and had no chance with the penalty			0
@entity30 5.5 – had his hands full against @entity83 and struggled at times			0
@entity108 5 – enjoyed a large slice of luck on his return to @entity3 , diverting a @entity83 effort against the underside of the bar and escaping a red card for fouling @entity89			0
@entity10 6 – former @entity0 man did a good marking job on @entity89 and was very unfortunate to be sent off for fouling the @entity97 when the guilty man was teammate @entity119			1
@entity89 controls the ball ahead of @entity30 during the @entity122 match at @entity3 @entity123 6 – got forward a couple of times to send in searching crosses but pinned back for much of the game			0
@entity128 6.5 – a key part of @entity2 ’s defensive plan and made a couple of fantastic interceptions , including one on @entity83 in the first half			2
@entity48 5.5 – upset the @entity0 fans with a clear dive and made little impression			2
@entity138 6 – had to be more defensive than usual and rescued his team with a goal - line clearance in the first half			0
former @entity142 striker @entity141 battles for the ball with @entity0 's @entity34 @entity31 5 – former @entity145 man produced very little of note , but this was not a day for @entity2 ’s creative players			1
@entity23 5.5 – had @entity2 ’s best chance when he broke forward from deep to test @entity150 but struggled to make an impact after that and came off after 67 minutes			0
@entity141 6 – @entity153 in the first and pestered @entity0 ’s back - four in a lonely role up front , but faded after half - time and subbed at the same time as @entity23 referee @entity158 – 4 @entity159 man : @entity5 @entity160 midfielder @entity53 challenges midfielder @entity31 for the ball during the game at @entity3			1

@entity5 *starred* as @entity0 beat @entity2
@entity6 striker *bagged* a second half double to earn hosts all three points
@entity69 continued to struggle and was hauled off at half time
@entity2 defender @entity10 was *mistakenly* sent off in the game
