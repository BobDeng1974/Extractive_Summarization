the six - bedroom house in upmarket @entity10 , central @entity11 , was put on the market for £ 4million as the credit crunch hit in september 2008			1
it fell into disuse and was invaded by squatters as the @entity17 took 18 months to find a buyer - and accounts suggest it could have sold for as little as £ 3million in april 2010			1
eye - watering : the home secretary 's former grace - and - favour home in @entity10 , central @entity11 , has sold for £ 14million - more than three times what the government got for it in the recession just four years ago home : the central @entity11 property was once occupied by @entity30 ( right at his front door in 2005 ) less than four years later , it has been sold on to a property firm for an enormous mark - up			1
@entity35 paid £ 14million for the house in february - helped by the previous owners winning permission to turn it into a sprawling luxury home with an ' iceberg ' basement			1
@entity30 was the last home secretary to live in the shabby postwar house before the government ruled it was no longer needed			1
he hit out at the apparent wasted opportunity , telling @entity45 : ' it would have been nice if they [ the government ] had got a more substantial investment back '			0
the house made headlines in 2009 when it was invaded by serial squatter @entity52 , who put a ' legal warning ' on the window and invited reporters into his new home for an interview			0
outdated : a @entity17 spokesman insisted the home , pictured in 2009 , was in need of refurbishment ' it 's a disgrace , ' he told the @entity63 at the time			0
' why the hell do they leave a place like this empty ? it has lost about £ 2million in value since @entity30 went and there are more like this in the ownership of @entity73 's government			2
' in @entity10 alone there are 312 properties left empty by offshore companies and more that are just being left to rot			0
' but the @entity17 was also a victim of a crippling recession followed by spiralling @entity11 house prices			2
average prices near mr @entity82 's former home in @entity83 have risen £ 2million - 50 per cent - since the depths of the recession in 2009			2
a @entity17 spokesman refused to confirm how much the house sold for in 2010			0
the department 's accounts , however , list what is thought to be the former grace and favour home , and put the final sale value of the building and land at just £ 3.029million			1
lying empty : the house pictured as it spent 18 months languishing on the market during the recession just three years later , the house 's new owners exploded its value by winning planning permission to knock it down and turn it into two eight - storey homes - including three levels in the basement			1
the ' iceberg ' homes approved last year would include a cinema room , snooker room , wine store , offices and a garage with a car lift			0
it is not thought building work had started when it was sold on for £ 14million in february			2
