by @entity0 for @entity1 an ex-gang member who was expelled from school for attempting to kill a fellow pupil has spoken out about the dangers of teen violence and warned that parents need to start taking more responsibility for their children 's behaviour			2
@entity11 , 36 , spent much of her teens living a life of crime on the streets of south @entity16 , where she grew up and still lives			1
but several years ago , the mother - of - two got her life back on track and started to work as a mentor for other troubled youths			1
she went on to co-write a play about the issue and has now released a memoir going into detail about her life of crime in an attempt to deters others from following suit , appearing on this morning today to tell her story and explaining how easy it is to end up in a gang			2
@entity11 talking about her time in a gang on this morning @entity11 's destructive attitude started early on , when she was expelled from her senior school after attempting to stab another girl in her class			1
she was 13 years old and living with her manic - depressive mother three siblings in @entity42 , while her father was facing life in prison			1
she said : ' the first time i picked up a knife there was a character at home and he was a paedophile			1
' i was too scared to tell my mum as she 's a manic depressive and she might have killed him			2
' seeing as my dad was incarcerated , there would have been no one else to look after me if i had told her and she had tried to kill him			2
' one day i overheard that this man had touched another family member , so i took a knife and put it under my pillow at night			1
' so the knife was already in her possession when an incident happened with a friend at school that caused tempers to flare			1
she said : ' people do n't understand that when you have a parent who 's a manic depressive , it can be quite embarrassing			2
' i had taken a friend home and my mum went through a manic episode while she was there			2
' this girl went back to school and told everyone and i thought , ' i want to kill her			2
' ' so i took the knife to school with me and tried to stab her , but the people in my class stopped me , they all jumped on me			1
' after that i was expelled			0
' ' the next school i was sent to was a tough school - it has closed down now			0
' they 'd already heard of me there because of the knife incident , so i thought i 'd carry on with with this reputation			1
i never intentionally set out to be that character but once i had people at school that took my lead i carried on with it - i got an adrenaline rush from it			0
' ' it goes to show that children are a by - product of their environment and parents need to be aware of that and take it seriously			0
' @entity11 's behaviour went downhill fast at her new school , she became involved in a gang that would regularly rob local businesses like off licences and even ice cream vans			1
the situation got so unsafe that she ended up sleeping next to a hand gun every night for protection			1
but as dangerous as their crimes were , @entity11 maintains that gang life nowadays is far more out - of - control			1
a scene during the @entity125 riots in 1995 showing looted shops in @entity127 she said : ' the guys i got together with , we targeted businesses			1
' a situation like a lady going home from work , doing something like putting a knife against her through and mugging her - hell no , we had morals			1
' my generation of gangs set the trend for ' licking it			0
' ' we 'd go into a business , try and get the cash and then get out as quick as we could with no violence			0
' now kids have taken it to a whole new level - with initiations			0
' the final straw came when she was shot with a sawn - off shotgun during the @entity152 in 1995			1
she said : ' it was the @entity125 riots , they were looting the area i was standing in and as we were running , a guy turned and opened fire			0
' he had a sawn - off shotgun and it was like the sky just lit up			0
' i rolled under a car but it was too late - i 'd been shot			1
@entity11 revisits the place where she was shot during the @entity152 in 1981 ' when the crowd dispersed i got up and started to walk away and that 's when the pain hit me - it felt like my leg had been torn off and i just collapsed			1
' i 've still till got ball - bearings lodged in my body			0
' the effects of that combined with me getting into a relationship with a man led to me eventually taking an overdose and just losing the momentum for being naughty , that was the change			0
' @entity11 also fell pregnant , prompting her to turn her life around completely			1
she has spent several years now mentoring troubled young people in various areas of @entity16 and also visits @entity186 in her role			2
this week she has brought out a her memoirs , called sour , in a an effort to try and use her story to prevent other people following a similar path			0
she said : ' there 's two ways of looking at it - if i had n't done that then i could n't mentor the people that i do now , but equally i could have done something better with my life like be a brain surgeon maybe			2
' i 'd rather i had n't done what i did , but it is what it is			0
' i do n't want sympathy , this is just a story that i felt needed to be told			0
' this is to convince other youngsters to come out and tell their story , or to convince them to change their paths			0
' people need to be told that there are no grey areas in life , it 's black or white - you know what 's right or wrong			0
' as for parents - they are your children			0
so if your kids are coming back with stuff that you know you have n't given them , inspect their rooms , look through their phones , connect with them			0
