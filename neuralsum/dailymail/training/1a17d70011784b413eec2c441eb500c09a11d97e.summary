by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has been forced to defend @entity4 ’s record on using @entity6 expenses , insisting he uses the public money to campaign for @entity8 to leave @entity9			1
the @entity4 leader said he had ‘ no idea ’ how much he has claimed since becoming an mep , despite previously boasting it topped £ 2million			1
and he again sought to justify having his wife @entity14 on the payroll , insisting no - one else has ‘ anything like the workload that i 've got ’			1
mrs @entity25 was ordered to repay £ 5,800 in overclaimed mortgage expenses and found to have broken the @entity29 ’ code of conduct in her belligerent attitude towards the independent parliamentary standards commissioner			1
the offence was compounded when the @entity25 delivered a curt 32 - second apology in the @entity36			1
last night mr @entity2 insisted mrs @entity25 ’s constituents should have the right to trigger a by - election to remove her as an mp			1
but in an interview on @entity42 he was repeatedly challenged about his own claims			2
in 2009 mr @entity2 boasted that he had claimed a ‘ vast sum ’ in allowances , claiming it ‘ must be pushing £ 2million ’			1
asked how much he has claimed since then , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ no idea			2
less than most mps , but no idea what the total figure is			2
‘ the system in @entity6 is entirely different , more lax than in @entity53 , but we operate on a system of allowances and not expenses			1
’ mr @entity2 drinks beer from a large glass at the @entity61 pub after speaking at a @entity4 public meeting at @entity63 he insisted he had not benefitted ‘ personally ’ from the generous allowances on offer in @entity6 , and @entity4 had not broken the rules			1
mr @entity2 told newsreader @entity67 : ‘ if you are accusing me and @entity4 of taking the wherewithal provided by the @entity71 for us as @entity73 , and using it politically to campaign against @entity8 's membership of the @entity76 , and you think that is wrong , that is you decision			2
‘ that is quite different			0
it is different from benefiting personally			0
‘ we have n’t broken the rules of the @entity71			0
we have been very careful at using our lawyers and using our accountants to dot the @entity84 and cross the @entity85			0
‘ but be in no doubt that we use the money to fight @entity8 ’s membership			0
' there is nothing i 've done with my expenses in 15 years that has been done for personal gain			2
i 've not breached the rules for personal gain			0
' i have n't bought a house and made £ 1 million , what i have done is to try and publicise across this country the extent to which membership of this union is damaging this country			0
i would like to think i have n't done a bad job of that			0
' mr @entity2 used a speech to supporters in @entity20 to attack the government over the @entity110 scandal mr @entity2 was also challenged over his decision to pay his wife @entity14 using public money			1
he said : ‘ she ’s paid a very modest sum of money , just over £ 25,000 a year			0
‘ i very much doubt that there is any other @entity8 mep who has anything like the workload that i 've got			0
@entity25 quit as @entity25 six days after being told to repay £ 5,800 ‘ she did it unpaid for seven years			2
she has done it , paid a modest sum , for the last seven years			0
that arrangement will end in a few weeks ' time			0
’ last month mr @entity2 denied that @entity127 , an aide also on the public payroll , was his former mistress			1
@entity4 has been hit by a number of expenses scandals , including mep @entity131 who was jailed for two years after fraudulently claiming £ 39,000			1
mr @entity2 conceded : ‘ there are two cases of @entity4 meps who behaved badly and acted dishonestly			2
‘ in both cases i got rid of them from the party before any investigation was finished by the outside authorities or any prosecutions were brought			0
i dealt the problem as soon as i saw it			0
’ he contrasted his actions with mr @entity145 ’s determination to cling on to mrs @entity25 for almost a week after her @entity36 apology			1
‘ i think the real issue with the @entity25 case - apart from the fact the taxpayer helped her make a profit of £ 1 million - but the real issue is that @entity145 has supported her all of the way through and now he is saying he will have her back in the @entity154 as soon as he can			1
‘ you will find in every political party people who do things that are wrong , but the question is how you deal with it			0
