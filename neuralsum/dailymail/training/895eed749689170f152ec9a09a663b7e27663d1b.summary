by @entity0 one of the last homeowners in @entity2 without electricity faces a £ 20,000 bill to be connected to the @entity5 - despite living just a few yards from power lines			1
retired @entity8 , 65 , generates his energy with a noisy diesel generator and has to buy fresh food every day because he ca n’t have a fridge or freezer , even though his nearest neighbour , who lives 30 yards away , enjoys 24 - hour electricity			1
mr @entity8 has spent years spent begging the @entity5 to hook up his remote farmhouse in the @entity18 village of @entity19 to mains electricity , and thought he had finally won last october when @entity21 ( @entity22 ) agreed to extend existing electricity cables to his 200 - year - old home for £ 6,800			1
but just as the former telephone engineer was planning which electrical gadgets he might treat himself to , the company refunded his money and told him connection to the mains would now cost him £ 20,000			2
@entity31 , 65 , from @entity19 , @entity18 , lives yards from the @entity33 but still is n't connected to mains electricity so close : his farmhouse , circled in blue , lies 30 yards from the power lines he wants to be connected to mr @entity8 was told the price had gone up because workers would need to close off part of the nearby @entity33 , one of the region ’s busiest roads , to fit underground cables			1
he said : ' i would love to live in the 21st century but sometimes it seems as if even the 20th century has n’t happened yet			0
' apparently the company now wants to renegotiate the price			0
they ’ve told me it could now cost up to £ 20,000 to connect me , but that they do n’t know for sure			2
' they keep saying they ’ll come back to me with a firm price but it ’s just delay , delay and more delay			0
' @entity8 relies on an ageing @entity59 diesel generator to power his home for four or five hours a day , and ca n’t use any electrical items that need constant power			1
despite its secluded location , his £ 350,000 property is just a few hundred yards from the @entity33 trunk road , and has @entity68 poles right outside it			0
mr @entity8 said : ' years ago when i first thought about having mains electricity there were planning objections , to do with it being an @entity74 and so on			1
' i just want to live in the 21st century ' : but mr @entity8 still has to use this ancient generator for power ' but there are now @entity68 poles right outside my house , the main @entity33 has been upgraded a number of times and it ’s about to be turned into a dual carriageway			1
' there are electricity pylons and poles all across @entity85 - so i ca n't see that there are any planning issues at all			2
' he added : ' the most sensible thing is probably to just extend the mains cable that powers my neighbours but apparently the existing cable is n’t powerful enough to cope with two properties			0
' i ’ve suggested uprating that cable , but still nothing has happened			0
i ’m just waiting for @entity21 to tell me what ’s going on , and i ’ve been waiting now for nearly a year			0
' @entity22 said scheduled works to widen the @entity33 may give their engineers a chance to run cables underneath while the road is being dug up			0
almost every home in @entity2 and @entity104 is connected to the @entity5 , with nine properties in the tiny @entity107 village of @entity108 among the last to be hooked up in 2008			0
most of rural @entity18 was connected in the early 20th century , with even the smallest villages joining in the 1950s and 60s			0
remote : mr @entity8 bought his farmhouse in the middle of @entity85 in @entity18 20 years ago by the end of the 20th century only a handful of isolated rural settlements remained without a mains electricity supply			1
mr @entity8 , who dreams of having a fridge - freezer and a proper shower , says he was told 15 years ago there were only nine people in the country without mains electricity - and he thinks he now might be the last			1
' when i bough the house 20 years ago i thought we would get mains electricity very soon			1
now i still dream of a fridge , a freezer , and a proper shower			2
' - householder @entity8 , 65 he and his late wife , @entity131 , bought the three - bedroom farmhouse 20 years ago and assumed it would be a simple job to have it hooked up to the @entity5			1
but he still relies on a noisy old diesel generator and has to make a 20 - mile round trip every day to get fresh fruit and veg because he ca n't preserve anything for more than a few hours			1
the father - of - five , whose wife died two years ago , said : ' when i bought the house i thought we would get mains electricity very soon , but it 's been 20 years and i really need it now			1
' the main things i would like are a fridge and freezer and a proper power shower			2
i 'm fed up with my existing one , the water just drips out weakly			0
' the generator breaks a couple of times a year so i have to get someone to come out , and it means i 'm left without electricity for a couple of days and i have to rely on friends and family			0
' i always have lots of candles , torches and batteries on standby just in case the power goes			0
' it costs around £ 1,000 a year to power and i use five litres of diesel a day in the summer and ten in the winter			2
' the grandfather of six , who says he has to go to his brother 's house to watch football , added : ' you can guarantee that if there 's an important match on the tv will go dead right at the vital moment			0

@entity8 , 65 , bought remote farmhouse on @entity85 20 years ago
he assumed it would be simple to connect to mains electricity , but it was n't
uses an old @entity59 diesel generator - and up to ten litres of diesel a day
last october @entity21 said they **'d** hook him up for £ *7,000*
but in april they changed their mind and said it would cost around £ 20,000
said the cost had gone up because they **'d** have to close the @entity33 to do it
*widower* mr @entity8 said : ' i dream of a power shower and a fridge - freezer '
