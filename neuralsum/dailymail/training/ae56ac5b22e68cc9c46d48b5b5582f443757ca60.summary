by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 09:21 est , 1 january 2014 local councils have spent more than £ 3million on social media since the start of the government 's austerity programme			1
public spending has been cut by billions over the past three years , but many councils have been spending ever - increasing amounts on pushing messages through sites such as @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
eight councils have spent more than £ 100,000 on tweeting and similar activities , with some employing members of staff solely to work on social media			1
others spent thousands keeping up to date with what people are saying about them online - behaviour more often associated with paranoid regimes than local authorities			1
pricey : eight local councils have spent more than £ 100,000 on social media since 2010 - 11 critics say that councils are wasting their money on social media rather than delivering vital services or reducing the tax burden , but councillors claim they are actually saving money by shifting their communications online			1
@entity38 sent freedom of information requests to every unitary authority , borough and county council in the @entity43 , asking how much money they have spent on social media since 2010 - 11			1
dozens refused to answer , saying it is impossible to calculate how much of their employees ’ time is spent updating official social media accounts			2
in total , 129 councils agreed to provide details of how much they have spent on social media , including staff costs , employee training , technology purchases and advertising			1
the figures show that they spent a total of £ 3,222,000 over the past three and a half years - a time when the @entity61 has ordered councils to cut billions from their budgets			0
that works out at an average of around £ 25,000 for each council which responded			0
top of the league : @entity68 has spent more than any other authority on social media the biggest spender of all was @entity68 , where 13 members of staff spend at least part of their time operating social networking accounts - the council estimates that the total cost of social media since 2010 - 11 has been £ 147,480			1
a spokesman for the council said : ' we 're proud of our commitment to social media and in terms of @entity13 followers we are one of the most followed councils in the country			1
@entity88 's spending on social media since 2010 - 11 ' social media is a cost - effective and innovative way to reach people as they go about their daily lives			1
' our customer service staff use social media to receive and respond to a wide range of service requests from our customers every day			2
many people in the city now prefer to contact us in this way			0
' @entity100 came second , with a total bill of £ 137,626 – including £ 16,000 on a piece of software which allows organisations to monitor what people are saying about them on social media			2
councillor @entity108 said : ' social media is one of the main ways all modern organisations communicate and @entity100 is no different			0
the technology allows us to both listen to residents and efficiently communicate with them			0
' six other councils admitted to having spent over £ 100,000 – @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			2
communications : a grab from the @entity12 page of @entity125 , which has spent £ 113,250 on social media in the past three and a half years messages : a selection of tweets sent out this month by @entity121 , which has also spent more than £ 100,000 ' town halls should focus on keeping council tax low , not wasting it on barely followed @entity13 accounts , ' @entity130 of the @entity131 told @entity38			1
' too often , local government bureaucrats worry too much about their presence on social media , rather than focussing on delivering taxpayers value for money			2
' the best tweet a council could give out would be that they 're cutting council tax and closing the account			0
' cost of video equipment bought by @entity146 to make @entity14 clips it is not possible to break down the data on an annual basis , because of the different ways that councils provided their figures , but representative examples suggest that spending has been increasing rapidly			1
@entity156 spent less than £ 8,000 on social media staff in the whole of 2010 - 11 - but from april to october last year , a period of just seven months , the council spent almost £ 20,000 , four times as much per month			1
while most local government activity seems to be restricted to @entity13 and @entity12 , others spentd thousands on video equipment to help them produce professional @entity14 clips - @entity165 bought a camera , autocue and clip - on microphones for nearly £ 4,000			1
many councils have sent staff to attend social media training courses which can cost hundreds or even thousands of pounds a time			1
for example , @entity175 in @entity176 has paid for five different courses , including one on ' engaging with citizens through social media ' and another on ' building a social media strategy '			0
and for the council which governs @entity183 , a similar course had an extra cost - the islands are so remote from the @entity43 mainland that officials had to spend £ 685 on flights in order to attend the training			2
money - saver ? councils claim that using @entity12 helps them cut costs on traditional forms of communication waste ? campaigners say councils would be better off shutting down their @entity13 accounts many local authorities insisted that spending thousands on social media allowed them to save money by cutting down on activities such as sending press releases or letters to residents			1
a spokesman for the @entity208 said : ' councils use social media like every other private and public organisation			2
it is a vital and immediate way to communicate efficiently and effectively			0
' for example , during severe weather bouts social media is relied upon by millions of residents wanting to know if vital services are running and transport networks are open			0
it is also often the only way that many people can access this information from their local authority			0
' in addition to keeping residents informed , using new technology , including social media , has helped councils save millions of pounds			2
communicating with residents is of huge importance , especially with councils having to make difficult decisions about how they pay for vital services			0
' an average annual cost of £ 4,000 per council is good value considering the impact and reach that social media has			2
' how much @entity233 spent on flying staff to social media training some councils ' social media accounts appear to have a relatively small following - for example , @entity238 has fewer than 10,000 @entity13 followers and just 1,100 @entity12 fans , despite a population of 250,000			1
the council has nonetheless spent more than £ 80,000 on social networking , working out at £ 7.50 for each online follower			0
@entity246 & @entity247 , in @entity176 , has spent even more per person - £ 12.30 for every one of the 3,500 residents who are signed up to its @entity12 and @entity13 pages			0
nearly 80 councils said that they either spend negligible amounts on social media or that they could not work out how much time employees spent on @entity12 and @entity13 - even though other local authorities , including big - spending @entity68 , were able to provide minute breakdowns of staff duties			1
@entity257 , communications director at @entity259 , said that social media has become so integrated into day - to - day work that it is impossible to separate @entity13 and @entity12 from more traditional media such as press releases			1
' social media is a major tool for us , ' he said			0
' but i 'd find it completely impossible to put a figure against it			0
' a number of councils , including @entity273 and @entity274 , told @entity38 that they employ a member of staff whose main job is to update social media , but refused to reveal the worker 's salary for fear of breaching data protection rules			2
around two dozen councils simply failed to respond to the @entity284 within the legally mandated 20 - day limit			0
' every bit of the public sector needs to do their bit to pay off the inherited budget deficit , including local government which accounts for a quarter of all public spending , ' said a spokesman for the @entity294			0
' councils should focus on cutting waste and making sensible savings to protect frontline services and keep council tax down			0
' if councils are making greater use of social media , then they should be able to drive down costs or remove costs completely			0
cutting overall spending on communications is a good way of making sensible savings			0
