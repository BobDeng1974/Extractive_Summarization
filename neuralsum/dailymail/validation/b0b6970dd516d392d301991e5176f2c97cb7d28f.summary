@entity0 had received treatment for ' suicidal tendencies ' but doctors were apparently unable to tell his employer because of strict secrey laws introduced after @entity6 to prevent a repeat of government spying during the @entity10 era strict @entity12 privacy laws which prevented doctors treating @entity0 from telling his airline about his ' suicidal tendencies ' were introduced in response to @entity10 rule			1
the @entity19 pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week 's @entity24 disaster			1
but @entity12 law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer , something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash			1
the findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in @entity36 on a patient 's right to privacy , with chancellor @entity39 proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law			1
draconian legislation was initially brought in after @entity6 to prevent a repeat of government spying during the @entity10 era and subsequently the @entity45 secret police in @entity36			1
this extends far beyond confidential medical data , however , to stringent protection of someone 's identity , meaning many @entity12 publications only referred to @entity0 as @entity52 , even after his death			1
further data protection laws traced back to 1907 , which enshrines the ' right to your own picture ' , also mean images can only be published with the individual 's consent , it was reported by the @entity61			1
with respect to medical data , the criminal code can ultimately leave doctors between a rock and a hard place			1
for it only allows them breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent ' a particularly serious crime ' or a threat to someone 's life			2
they can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy , but up to five years in jail for withholding ' credible information about the planning or commission ' of serious acts like murder			1
despite the variation in sentences , doctors have tended to favour the individual 's privacy			1
still reeling from last tuesday 's disaster that killed 150 people , many in @entity36 are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor - patient privilege			1
a transport policy expert from chancellor @entity39 's @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , @entity104 , said strict confidentiality policy should be loosened when their patients work in sensitive fields			1
professionals such as pilots ' should only see doctors designated by their employers , ' @entity109 told the daily @entity114			2
he added that such doctors ' should be relieved of their pledge of secrecy in communication with the employer and the aviation authority '			2
military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the @entity19 plane crash in @entity127 - les - @entity126 a military vehicle carrying a crash site investigation team heads towards the site of the @entity19 @entity132 crash , in @entity133 in the @entity135 @entity134 member of parliament @entity136 , also of the @entity103 , called for the creation of a commission of experts to study how to handle illnesses among those whose jobs mean they hold the welfare of many people in their hands			2
@entity12 prosecutors said monday that @entity0 had been diagnosed ' several years ago ' with suicidal tendencies and was still in treatment			1
although his symptoms had abated , he was apparently written off sick on the day the @entity132 crashed			1
media reports have indicated that @entity0 , 27 , was taking medication for severe depression and was being treated for problems with his vision , possibly for a potentially career - ending detached retina			1
investigators evaluating voice recorder data say @entity0 remained silent and breathed calmly as he allegedly locked his captain out of the cockpit and slammed the plane into a @entity135 mountainside			1
@entity162 , the head of parent company @entity164 , has said the airline was utterly unaware of any health issues that could have compromised @entity0 's fitness to fly , calling him ' 100 - percent airworthy '			1
his professional performance and behaviour had never attracted cause for concern , @entity162 added			0
the @entity172 has clear ethical policies on doctor - patient relations : ' doctors must remain silent about what is told to them in confidence or what they learn in their capacity as doctors			0
' it applies even after the death of a patient and includes keeping medical facts secret even from family members of the person in treatment , under penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine			2
tragedy : relatives of the victims of the air crash visit the memorial in @entity196 , south - eastern @entity135 perilous : @entity198 stands by a bulldozer clearing a path to the crash site of the @entity19 @entity132 in the mountains near @entity126 as the recovery operation continues calling for change : @entity205 with her boyfriend @entity206 , who died in the @entity134 plane disaster the grief - stricken girlfriend of a @entity210 student killed in the @entity24 plane disaster today called for tougher controls to weed out psychopathic pilots			2
at present , airlines carry out regular checks on their pilots , but this often just involves a brief chat with a doctor to assess their wellbeing			0
@entity205 , who is from @entity222 , told @entity223 : ' besides general physical , psychological and behavioural evaluation , another test should be added , i believe , to help avoid more deaths in the future			0
' ( this should be ) a neurological pet scan to discover and attentively observe psychopathic tendencies , so as to find out whether the subject is prone to violence and therefore not be given the extensive power that would most likely lead to harming other people			0
' it is one thing to be suicidal or obsessive , but feeling no remorse or even nervousness when killing other human beings is a whole new level - a zone only real psychopaths can fully understand			0
' ms @entity205 also called for laws to be relaxed to allow doctors greater freedoms to flag up patients with mental health problems if they are responsible for the live of others			1
@entity12 law meant it was left entirely up to @entity0 to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer , something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash			1
she said : ' i personally think that the problem does n't lie in the management of the airline as much as in the general tendency of the society to be overly protective about people 's medical data			2
' it is visible to everyone if somebody has a serious physical illness , but when it comes to major mental problems , these are hidden away at any cost for fear of embarrassment or judgement			0
' however , those are illnesses as well and should be treated and inspected accordingly , especially when it comes to job positions regarding huge responsibilities			0
' her boyfriend , @entity206 , from @entity285 , was studying hospitality and hotel management in @entity288 , @entity289 , where he was about to start an internship after travelling with her			0
he had been to @entity292 after completing his first term of college for a few days ' holiday with friends			0
mr @entity206 was flying back to the @entity210 via @entity297 to see his family			0
@entity299 one exception , however , is when medical professionals have been excused from this duty by the patient , or when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent ' a particularly serious crime ' or a threat to someone 's life			2
a doctor is also obliged to come forward in cases of ' psychiatric illnesses or a possible threat of suicide ' , member of parliament @entity318 , himself a physician , told the daily @entity320			0
the @entity12 board 's head , @entity321 , urged caution in reassessing the policy			0
patient privacy is a ' cherished fact and , for all the citizens of @entity36 , a human right , ' he said			1
' you can tell a society that cares about rules when it does n't slip into hasty action - for - action 's - sake			0
or populism , ' weekly magazine @entity334 wrote in an editorial on its website			0
' you can also tell a society that can handle the incomprehensible when it becomes clear it was a one - off case , extreme in every way			0
' and , according to the rules of a humanitarian society , indeed - as terrible as it is - unpreventable			0
' the daily @entity346 noted a change in policy could have a chilling effect on people seeking the necessary treatment			0
' police also have the right ... to a frank talk with a doctor without worrying that their employer will be told			2
' meanwhile investigators sifting through the wreckage and hundreds of body parts in the @entity134 were forced to resume the hunt on foot as bad weather hampered helicopter flights			0
' the teams will get to the site via the path that is already in existence , ' said @entity368 from the local mountain police			2
authorities are hoping to identify more dna from the 150 people who died , as well as locate the jet 's second black box that should provide more clues as to the circumstances of the tragedy			0
forensic teams have isolated almost 80 distinct dna strands from the shattered aircraft and have described the grim task as ' unprecedented ' given the tricky mountain terrain and the speed at which the plane smashed into the rock .			0

strict laws left it up to @entity0 to tell employers about health issues
but he tore up sick note on day of disaster with devastating consequences
legislation brought in to stop a repeat of spying by @entity399 and @entity45 police
debate rages in @entity36 over whether to loosen medical privacy laws
