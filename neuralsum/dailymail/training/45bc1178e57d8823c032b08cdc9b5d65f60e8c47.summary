by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 26 october 2013 working almost 100 metres above those charged with running the country , five timekeepers worked frantically behind the scenes to ensure things ran like clockwork			2
they are the @entity7 of the clock and have the unique job of upholding the world 's most iconic timepiece - @entity10			1
and last night was the dawn of their busiest hours of the year as the clocks went back and we moved from @entity17 to @entity18			1
as millions enjoyed an extra hour in bed , @entity19 and his colleagues faced a five - hour mission to turn back the hands of @entity27 's most iconic clock the bell was made in 1858 in @entity29 and took two weeks to cool before being transported to the tower on a horse draw carriage once the arduous task of turning back the hands of @entity10 was complete the team set about changing the 2,000 clocks in @entity36 which will take them until monday while millions of people welcomed the extra hour 's lie in this morning , the five - strong team set in motion a complex , five - hour process to move the most famous hands in @entity27 with millisecond precision			1
the foursome were tasked with altering the 154 - year - old , 13 - and - a - half - tonne ageing timepiece , a focal point on the capital 's famous skyline			1
if the notoriety was not enough , the keepers faced the prospect of high winds , the famous four faces being plunged into darkness , and the potential uproar were anything to happen to the priceless chime			0
however former soldier turned horological forerunner , @entity19 , was not fazed by the daunting job , which passed off smoothly			0
the veteran of nine years scales the 334 steps to the top of the iconic tower three times a week to carry out regular health checks , measure the pendulum 's swing and keep a watchful eye on any deteriorating parts			1
the 51 - year - old father - of - one , from @entity75 in south @entity29 , sett up base for his two - day marathon shift to ensure everything went like clockwork			1
pennies are used to adjust the 14.5ft pendulum ’s swing , adding or taking them away to alter the time by two fifths of a second the whole process requires painstaking precision and immense skill to ensure the hands are not wound too far , as there is no rewind mechanism as the 9.45pm chime rung out over the capital , mr @entity19 and his team went to work , beginning the intricate process			1
the clock wass not heard chiming again until 2am ' we meet up as usual and take on the foreboding staircase , there ’d be no other way for us as it ’s part of the romance making your way up them , ' said @entity19			1
' and when you reach the top and move into the belfry you can hear the immense ticking			2
' the beauty of the mechanics is what intrigues all of us			0
it runs on remarkable precision and the fact it is more than 150 years old is extraordinary			2
' @entity10 is the giant bell in the belfry of the clock tower , renamed @entity10 last year			2
it stands at adjacent to the @entity122 and was cast at @entity123 in east @entity29 in april 1858			0
it took two weeks to cool and once it was ready , it was transported the @entity122 on a horse drawn carriage			0
thousands of @entity129 lined the route and cheered as the bell went past			0
once it was hoisted 96metres up into the tower , the finest clock - makers in the capital set about fine tuning every part of the @entity138 , finally getting it to start working at the end of may 1859			1
the first chimes rang through @entity36 six weeks later on july 11 , 1859			1
former soldier , mr @entity19 , said : ' after the job is done you realise just how privileged you are			0
when i walk over @entity146 and see the thousands of people taking pictures and waiting for the hour strike it is charming to know i am part of that ' it ran uninterrupted for 57 years until the lights were turned off for two years during the @entity153 to prevent attack by @entity156 zeppelins			2
the lights were extinguished again throughout the @entity158 but the clock continued to chime despite a @entity156 bombing raid damaging two of the dials in may 1941			2
' the people who built the clock were pioneers and designed something so solid it could withstand enemy attacks – most clocks ca n’t handle a bit of rain , ” said mr @entity19			1
' the bell was cast in iron and built to last , hopefully for another 150 years			0
' the first time the clocks were changed coincided with @entity153 and during 1916 mechanics set about forcing @entity10 ’s levers and cogs an hour forward on may 21			1
every year since men have fought through tired eyes and tired instruments to set @entity27 ’s watch			0
for some , it brings a heady excitement that @entity182 is just a few short shopping weeks away			0
for others , it heralds months of doom and gloom until we see the sun again			0
@entity17 officially ends this weekend when the clocks went back an hour this morning			1
debating the effects of turning the clocks back has been a @entity27 pastime for more than a century , when the first @entity194 was brought before the @entity195			1
during the @entity158 the government moved the clocks forward one hour to help munitions factories maximise productivity and allow people to get home safely before the blackout			1
between 1968 and 1971 the government carried out the same experiment but was forced to end it after complaints in @entity207 and northern @entity208			0
plans have also been mooted to move to @entity211 - something that would mean lighter winter evenings , which supporters claim would cut road deaths , boost tourism and reduce energy use			2
but the proposals have faced opposition from many in @entity207 who do not relish the prospect of an extra hour of darkness in the morning			2
clocks should have been put back 60 minutes at 2am this morning as the @entity27 reverted to @entity18 ( gmt )			1
they ensure temperatures are at an optimum level for the changeable metal parts , using heaters in winter and fans in summer to regulate it			0
pennies are used to adjust the 14.5ft pendulum ’s swing , adding or taking them away to alter the time by two fifths of a second			0
mr @entity19 joked : ' this is the most pampered clock in the world , we still follow traditional techniques to maintain it			1
' it would be much more straightforward to have an electrical motor inside – but all magnificence would be lost			0
' he joined lead engineer @entity247 and the rest of the team , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 to complete the arduous task			2
the last chimes sounded at 9.45pm last night before the bell tolled again at 2am on sunday			2
the dial lights are extinguished to allow the hands to be wound forwards without drawing too much public attention			0
and the hands are then advanced rapidly to midnight by releasing the escapement mechanism , which regulates the accuracy of the clock			2
the team took immense care to ensure the hands did not overrun , as they faced the prospect of winding the hands right round again if it had happened			1
in order to ensure the accuracy of the clock is not lost the pendulum is allowed to carry on its motion			0
mr @entity247 , 51 , said : ' on the saturday we ask a specialist inspection engineer to join us , and we also arrange for scaffolding to meander through the belfry tower to allow us to reach parts that need inspecting			0
' we then ring up the @entity277 to confirm when the bells will be stopped and restarted , as @entity279 still broadcast @entity10 live at midnight			0
' it is a job that requires unfathomable skill from our clock engineers , particularly in moving the hands forward to midnight - if they overshoot we can not go backwards			1
' between 10 and 11pm the team carried out inspections on various parts of the clock after the going train is stopped and clamped			2
the going train clamp was removed and the clock time adjusted to the correct time within one second			0
the clock ran for the next two hours without the hour or the quarter chimes , giving the team chance to check its accuracy and make any final adjustments			1
the @entity7 scale the tower 's 334 steps three times a week to carry out maintenance checks mr @entity19 , pictured , was joined by lead engineer @entity247 and the rest of the team , @entity303 , @entity251 and @entity252 at 1.46am , now @entity18 , the chime side and strike side hammers were unlocked to allow the strikes to sound the bells on the hour			1
two minutes before 2am the dial lights were switched back on and moments later the bells rang out across the @entity311 , completing the process for another six months			1
but for the team the next step was to change the 2,000 clocks inside @entity36 – working through until monday morning to make sure everything from @entity318 ’s oak grandfather clock in the prime minister ’s office to the @entity320 ’ wall piece is reached			1
mr @entity19 added : ' by this time we are running very nearly on empty so we do our best not to miss any – but not doubt we ’ll get a phone call on monday morning saying we ’ve missed one			0
' but after the job is done you realise just how privileged you are			0
when i walk over @entity146 and see the thousands of people taking pictures and waiting for the hour strike it is charming to know i am part of that			0
' you forget the eyes of @entity29 are on you until you ’re back down on the ground – and you have kept the country running on time			0

team worked two - day marathon shift to uphold world 's most iconic clock
five - hour process required painstaking precision and immense skill
the team then to changed 2,000 clocks across @entity36
clocks went back at 2am and we are now on @entity18 ( gmt )
