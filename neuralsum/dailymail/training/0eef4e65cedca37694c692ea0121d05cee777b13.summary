controversial : previously age - rated four + but now upgraded to 12 + , @entity9 encourages children to dress sexily and meet men in nightclubs values : gamers are told they must dress well and date sexy celebrities in order to further their careers gamers are encouraged to dress their celebrity avatar , or on - screen character , in racy clothing from lingerie shops and to visit nightclubs to flirt with ' hot celebrities ' in exchange for gifts			1

' very inappropriate ' : players of the @entity86 app are encouraged to invite men home with them critics of the game , which is free to download , say it promotes irresponsible values to young girls ' having had a rating of 4 + this app will likely have slipped under the radar of many parents who have taken steps to make sure their children are nâ€™t exposed to inappropriate content			1

' one reviewer , @entity109 , wrote : ' this app is simply horrid			0
how can someone actually enjoy this ? ' all this is is about are : guys , clothes , competition and nothing else ... and , to top it off , after you seduce a male ( for this occurs in many of the games ) you take him home with you like a sad little puppy who can flirt			2
