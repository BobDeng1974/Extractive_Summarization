hanging on one 93 - year - old man 's wall at a @entity3 nursing home was a photo collage of him and his wife			1
it was titled ' @entity7 & @entity8 , together forever '			0
that sentiment came true this week when , after 73 years of marriage , @entity12 ' @entity8 ' @entity10 and his wife @entity11 died just two minutes apart from each other			1
both @entity11 , 89 , and @entity8 were @entity16 's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes			1

after 73 years of marriage , high school sweethearts @entity10 , 93 , and @entity24 , 89 , passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week but on tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons , @entity31 , received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away			1
just five minutes later the phone rang again			0
@entity31 said it was his mother 's nursing home , calling with the same sad news			1
' we all look at it as a blessing , ' @entity31 told the @entity41 , ' because we 're going to have one funeral for both of them			1
' @entity31 , 66 , believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve			1
' we â€™re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life , ' he told the @entity53			2
the couple first met in @entity55 , where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts			0
@entity31 told the @entity41 that his parents ran off to get married and that he does n't believe ' either one of them had the blessings of their parents			1
' but that did n't stop the couple , who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage			1
@entity8 enlisted in the @entity69 when @entity70 began			0
after returning from @entity71 , he worked and managed various department and retail stores			0
@entity31 told the @entity53 that his mother , who he said ' had great taste ' , could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows			2
the family , which also included @entity31 's brothers @entity80 and @entity82 , hopped around the state and country			1
there were setbacks along the way			0
the couple unsuccessfully tried to open a shopping center in @entity90 and then one of @entity8 's department stores burned down and could n't reopen after they moved back to @entity3			1
the couple first met in @entity55 , @entity3 and , according to their son @entity31 , ran off and got married without either of their parents ' blessing			1
they spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other but @entity31 said his parents had a ' driving force ' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have			1
' they stressed college so much , ' @entity31 said			2
' and they were so proud that they had three sons who had college degrees			0
' and there were successes			0
after managing a number of stores , @entity8 decided to open his own realty firm			0
it grew from an $ 800 investment into a $ 1million - dollar company			0
he would also flip foreclosures , remodeling the houses before putting them back on the market			0
meanwhile @entity11 would repaint , wallpaper and do the trim work on the homes while @entity31 did the carpentry work			1
' we had a great time rehabbing houses together , ' he said			0
@entity8 was also known for his long - running morning radio show , where he was known as ' @entity132 ' and would organize a number of promotions and contests , including a twist - dancing competition that was so popular the police had to be brought in			0
the nickname stuck with @entity139 long after his radio show ended			2
he was even called ' @entity132 ' at his nursing home , where he would sometimes reenact his show in the cafeteria			0
@entity31 said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the @entity147 center			1
he said that , although the couple ' did n't have communication ' , he believes they were ' reading each other ' just by having the chance to see each other			2
when @entity31 last saw his father the sunday before his passing , he said @entity8 was wearing an oxygen mask and was ' barely hanging on '			2
to comfort him , @entity31 recited the opening that @entity8 used to say for every one of his radio shows			2
' i just told him , " this is @entity161 , your red - headed , freckle - faced , snaggle - toothed , snuff - dipping buddy " '			0
' and underneath the mask there , he grinned real big			0
i was glad of that			0
' friends and family will gather on saturday evening for a ' celebration of life ' service in honor of the devoted couple .			1

@entity12 ' @entity175 , 93 , and @entity11 , 89 , were both @entity16 's patients and had to live in separate nursing homes
but their son @entity31 often drove @entity11 to see @entity139 and said he believes they were able to ' read each other ' even when they had trouble communicating
the couple did n't have their parents ' blessings when they ran off to wed
but they survived a war and many moves and *job* changes during marriage
their *shared* funeral service will be a ' celebration of life '
