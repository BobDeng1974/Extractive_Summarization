@entity0 has launched a fresh verbal attack on @entity2 , branding their 11 year wait for the @entity6 title as ' boring '			1
led by skipper @entity8 - whose performance was described as his best ever by @entity0 - the @entity7 produced a defensive master class in a goalless draw at the @entity12 to take a step closer to the championship			1
frustrated at what they perceived as the visitors ' lack of attacking intent , home supporters chanted : ' @entity20 , boring @entity21 ' throughout sunday 's clash			1
@entity21 manager @entity0 has hit out at @entity2 and branded their 11 - year wait for the title ' boring ' @entity25 posted this picture on @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity8 and @entity32 after the @entity34 awards @entity21 players prepare to attend the @entity34 awards ceremony after their goalless draw with @entity2 @entity0 heaped special praise on to his captain @entity8 ( left ) for his ' fantastic ' performance on sunday @entity21 forward @entity31 ( right ) prepares to take on @entity2 midfielder @entity42 ( left ) on sunday @entity2 boss @entity43 accused @entity21 of being purposefully defensive during the goalless draw @entity45 ( away ) - april 29 @entity46 ( home ) - may 3 @entity48 ( home ) - may 10 @entity50 ( away ) - may 18 @entity51 ( home ) - may 24 their views were shared by @entity43 , who said @entity21 ' came to defend ' after the final whistle			1
but @entity0 , who started the game without a recognised centre - forward , hit back , insisting @entity2 's 11 years without winning the league is truly mundane			1
' @entity20 , i think , is 10 years without a title			2
that 's very boring , ' said the @entity62			2
' you support the club and you 're waiting , waiting , waiting for so many years without a @entity6 title , so that 's very boring			1
' but maybe they were n't singing to us			0
maybe , when you want to win a game and you 're at home and you take your no 9 [ @entity71 ] off , maybe the home fans want to see @entity73 and @entity71 up front			2
@entity21 are 10 points clear of second placed @entity76 at the top of the table with five games to play ' the boring team is the second team with most goals in the @entity6 , the best goal difference			1
only @entity76 have scored more goals than us			0
' if you tell the truth , people will fall in love with it			0
but you have to tell the truth			0
if you say the truth , you will walk in the truth and people will blow kisses at you			0
' ' so i think we scored a lot of goals and , in a period where we do n't have @entity100 or @entity101 and have only one striker , we need to work in a way where he can help ourselves with all the matches we are having			0
' we changed a bit our dynamic and we are not scoring so many goals as before			0
@entity0 , whose side need five points to secure the title , has n't needed much encouragement in criticising the @entity112 since arriving in @entity113 in 2004			1
he labelled @entity43 a ' voyeur ' in 2005 , before branding the @entity115 a ' specialist in failure ' last season			0
the special one was much more positive on the performance of his captain at the @entity12			2
' i told @entity8 in the dressing room that he made some fantastic performances with me but this was his best , ' said @entity0			1
@entity2 forward @entity126 ( right ) shields the ball from @entity21 midfielder @entity32 ( left ) @entity32 ( centre ) appeals to the referee @entity129 ( right ) after being shown a yellow card on sunday hazard ( left ) tussles for possession with @entity2 midfielder @entity134 ( right ) at the @entity12 @entity0 believes that @entity8 's performance against @entity2 was the best of the defender 's career ' it was the best @entity8 has ever played			1
one performance at @entity143 , i think in my first season , that was a fantastic performance , too			2
' but i think today everything was clean : reading the game , giving cover , the defensive line , interceptions , reading the game so well , interceptions with a pass			0
' the team was phenomenal , but @entity8 was one step ahead of every other player			2
' midfielder @entity155 , who was taken to hospital with suspected concussion after a heavy collision with @entity160 , started the game at centre - forward			0
in explaining his decision not to start with a recognised striker , @entity0 , who confirmed @entity100 and @entity101 are likely to miss the clash at @entity45 , added : ' first of all , @entity25 did n't work with us until saturday so we 'd developed the game - plan tactically , on the pitch , for the whole week without [ @entity25 ] @entity25			1
' we knew that with @entity155 we would get behind them like we did so many times in the first half			0
' in the second half we played with a target man [ @entity25 ] , more on the counter-attack , but every time we recovered the ball on the counter , they made a tactical foul			0
' @entity2 defender @entity179 ( left ) challenges @entity21 striker @entity25 ( right )			1

@entity21 edged closer to the @entity6 title after a 0 - 0 draw with @entity2 on sunday
the @entity7 were criticised in some quarters for an *over-defensive* display
@entity0 has *shrugged* off those claims and said that the real *boredom* was in @entity2 's 11 - year - wait to win a league title of their own
he *hailed* the *individual* performance of his captain @entity8 as the defender 's ' best ever ' in his career
