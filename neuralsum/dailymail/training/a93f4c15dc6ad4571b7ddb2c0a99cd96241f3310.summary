@entity0 learned a lot in @entity2			1
not on tuesday night , necessarily , but a year ago			0
it was in this fixture in the previous campaign that this @entity7 team began to take shape			1
@entity9 made a mistake that got @entity11 back into the game ; @entity13 was unconvincing in goal			1
@entity0 corrected both of those perceived flaws in the summer and on tuesday night those changes paid off			1
@entity19 , who has taken @entity13 ’s place as first choice goalkeeper , was quite outstanding and kept @entity7 in the match			2
@entity9 , sold to @entity11 for £ 50million , appeared to lose @entity23 for @entity7 ’s goal			1
his extraordinary fee made the signings of @entity27 and @entity28 possible and one imagines they will have greater influence on the outcome when these teams reconvene on march 11			1
@entity23 slides on his knees after scoring the opening goal of the last 16 @entity35 clash @entity37 international @entity23 wheels away in celebration after scoring his fifth goal of the season @entity11 forward @entity41 ( right ) celebrates after cancelling out @entity23 's first - half opener @entity41 looks to the sky after scoring past @entity7 goalkeeper @entity19 in the 54th minute @entity11 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity46 der @entity45 6 , @entity47 5.5 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 ; @entity50 6.5 ; @entity9 6.5 ; @entity51 6.5 ; @entity52 6.5 ( @entity53 81 ) , @entity54 6.5 ; @entity41 7 subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goal : @entity41 54 booked : @entity45 , @entity50 @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity19 7.5 ; @entity23 6 , @entity63 5.5 , @entity64 7 , @entity65 6.5 ; @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 7 ; @entity68 6 ( @entity69 79 ) , @entity28 7 ( @entity70 83 ) , @entity71 6 ; @entity27 6 ( @entity72 81 ) subs not used : @entity13 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 goal : @entity23 36 booked : @entity23 , @entity28 referee : @entity79 6 @entity27 and @entity28 were both recovering from spells out of the team and were below par. in three weeks ’ time it may be a different story			1
it will need to be because while this was a job well done , nobody should think a draw and an away goal amount to a guarantee for @entity7 against the champions of @entity91			1
it needed @entity19 to be at his very best , and @entity7 to weather a second - half onslaught in which @entity11 found a fresh level of menace , before the sides could shake hands , honours even			1
by then , @entity7 were more than acquainted with the danger posed in that second leg			1
@entity41 ’s 54th - minute equaliser was not the half of it			1
@entity11 ran out 3 - 1 winners here last year and could have done so again had @entity19 , and others , not been at the top of their game			2
this @entity11 side can not be underestimated , no matter what the history books say about the record of @entity91 teams in @entity113			1
having lost heavily a year ago , a 1 - 1 draw is to be respected			0
yet an away goal at @entity116 will make for a very tense night , and @entity118 ’s team are more than capable of it			0
@entity41 was a constant threat and while @entity54 has never scored against a @entity0 defence , he caused enough problems to suggest the continuation of that run can not be presumed			1
he should have won the tie deep in added time when a cross by @entity51 found him at the far post			0
his header was directed into the dirt and reared up to force the final intervention from @entity19 , tipping it around for a corner			0
there were other saves , equally spectacular			0
he had earlier kept @entity11 at bay with an outstanding low stop after @entity54 had broken free of his guards			2
the ball came out to @entity52 but this time @entity138 came to the rescue , making excellent ground to clear his line			0
@entity11 were certainly a different proposition after half - time			2
it had not been the most thrilling opening 45 minutes , in all truthfulness			0
in the 11th minute , a cross from @entity41 was headed powerfully goalwards by @entity51 , but parried with both hands by @entity19			1
from the next attacking phase , @entity51 crossed to @entity54 , whose header was again kept out by the @entity151			0
@entity7 then regrouped and it was not until the 33rd minute that @entity2 came close again			1
on this occasion it was a desperately poor touch by @entity66 that conceded possession and set up a @entity11 counter-attack			2
@entity138 took no chances offering up the corner and , from it , @entity52 ’s delivery was met by @entity41 at the near post , @entity19 ’ stunning reflexes equal to the challenge again			2
the @entity164 bristled with anticipation yet it is in @entity7 ’s nature to prick balloons and four minutes later @entity11 were behind			1
@entity23 receives a hug from @entity7 team - mate @entity67 after putting his side in the lead @entity23 rises above @entity11 's defence to give his side the lead in the 36th minute it was a goal remarkable for doing entirely without forwards , wide men or even hard - running midfielders			1
a set - piece had broken down but not left the danger zone and @entity64 sprinted out to the left to recover the loose ball			0
he whipped in an early cross , flicked on by his central defensive partner @entity63 and falling to right back @entity23 , who lost @entity9			1
as is his style in important games , @entity23 seized the moment and directed a deft header past goalkeeper @entity190			2
it was very clinical , very @entity7			2
they had to defend much the same way , as @entity2 upped the tempo after half - time			0
@entity0 will be upset at the goal , though , which came after a @entity51 cross was poorly read by @entity63 , pulled out of position , allowing @entity41 a free header from his favourite place on the edge of the six - yard box			1
it was the one occasion on the night when @entity19 was rendered powerless			0
for @entity9 , playing his first game against his former club , the match was a mixed bag			0
deployed in midfield in place of the injured @entity211 , he had a dust - up with @entity27 , took one from @entity28 , gave plenty back , will be disappointed with the goal , but pleased with his growing influence on @entity11 ’s build - up play after half - time			1
for a defender , he has an excellent range of passing , but not always the best sense of danger			0
one imagines @entity0 will still feel he got the best of that £ 50m transaction			2
@entity9 watches on as former @entity7 team - mate @entity23 heads towards goal @entity11 goalkeeper @entity190 was unable to stop @entity23 's header from hitting the back of the net this may go down as the earliest parking of a bus in the history of @entity235 football , close to two hours prior to kick - off when @entity7 ’s vehicle managed to get stuck in the @entity164 des @entity238 tunnel and was abandoned			1
@entity0 stomped off , face like thunder , and sent out a team in that image			2
this was a growl of a performance at times , brooding , occasionally irritable , but resolute			0
not that @entity11 were wholly different			2
they recognised @entity71 as the danger and swarmed around him , committing fouls			0
@entity27 copped it , too			0
the striker , as is his instinct , met fire with fire , leaving a foot in here and there and bristling with physical defiance as @entity11 sought to close him down			0
fabregas was hit hard and took his frustration out on @entity9			0
he had got away with a verbal warning and then @entity27 intervened , pulling @entity9 ’s hair on the sly and needlessly upping the ante just at the moment @entity7 should have been beating a respectful retreat			0
the professionals all love that spiky attitude but in this of all competitions , @entity27 ’s grumbles and rumbles could return to haunt his club			0
if referee @entity79 from @entity272 had seen it , there could have been damaging repercussions			0
still , all ’s well that ends well			0

@entity7 defender @entity23 opened the scoring in the 36th minute to give his side the lead at the interval
