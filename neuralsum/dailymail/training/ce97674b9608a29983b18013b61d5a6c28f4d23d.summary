by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 20:57 est , 29 january 2014 @entity4 could never be fully independent if it keeps the pound , the governor of the @entity3 warned yesterday			0
@entity6 said that @entity4 would have to share sovereignty with the rest of the @entity9 to avoid creating economic havoc			2
his assessment of a ‘ yes ’ vote on september 18 suggested that @entity4 would need to surrender control of interest rates and agree to strict rules controlling tax and spending			0
talks : @entity3 governor @entity6 meets first minister @entity19 to discuss @entity4 independence otherwise it would risk a eurozone - style disaster , where stronger nations , including the @entity9 and @entity24 , have been forced to prop up heavily indebted smaller ones , such as @entity26			1
mr @entity6 insisted in a speech in @entity28 that he was not passing judgment on whether @entity4 should be independent or on what currency arrangements an independent @entity4 could make			1
and he refused to be drawn over whether @entity4 would be better or worse off as an independent nation			0
but his intervention carried the clear implication that @entity4 can either be fully independent or stay with sterling – but not both			0
the governor ’s speech is likely to be a pivotal moment in the referendum battle , with just 230 days left until the vote			0
down to business : @entity3 governor @entity6 gives a speech in @entity28 mr @entity6 gave his first speech in @entity4 as governor of the @entity3 coming ahead of the 18 september independence referendum @entity4 first minister @entity19 insists an independent @entity4 would keep the pound			1
but a spokesman for @entity48 yesterday said it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ that the @entity50 would agree to it			0
chancellor @entity48 has vowed to veto any currency union between the @entity9 and an independent @entity4 the chancellor ’s spokesman said : ‘ governor @entity6 highlights the principled difficulties of entering a currency union : losing national sovereignty , practical risks of financial instability and having to provide fiscal support to bail out another country			1
‘ this is why the @entity50 have consistently said that in the event of independence , a currency union is highly unlikely to be agreed			1
the @entity4 government needs a @entity68 ’ former @entity70 chancellor @entity69 , who is leading the @entity71 campaign against @entity4 independence , said : ‘ make no mistake , the governor ’s judgement on currency unions is devastating for @entity19 ’s currency plans			1
’ and @entity78 , director - general of the @entity80 business lobby group , said : ‘ successful currency unions need strong fiscal agreements and a banking union			2
‘ this underlines why the @entity80 believes that the nations of the @entity9 are stronger together			0
’ after a meeting with mr @entity19 , governor @entity6 said : ‘ a durable , successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty			1
’ mr @entity6 acknowledged there are a number of benefits of currency unions , such as ease of trade and travel between countries			1
but he said there were also risks , including ‘ the potentially large costs ’ of giving up a flexible exchange rate and putting interest rates in the hands of the @entity3 in @entity104			0
he added that the risks of a poorly constructed currency union have been ‘ demonstrated clearly in the euro area over recent years ’			1
@entity109 advocates say they want to continue to use the pound as the country 's currency if the @entity4 people vote for separation in 2014 he said that an agreement would have to be hammered out on ‘ all aspects ’ of formal currency union between @entity4 and the rest of the @entity9			1
these would have to include strict controls on the levels of @entity4 ’s debt and deficit			0
he said ‘ tight fiscal rules ’ will be required to ensure that @entity4 runs its finances prudently rather than rely on support from taxpayers elsewhere in the @entity9			0
mr @entity6 also pointed out that there would have to be a ‘ banking union ’ with a central bank capable of bailing out failed lenders and propping up the financial system			2
that would mean @entity3 , @entity133 and @entity134 would have to rescue the @entity4 banking system and the @entity28 government if another financial crisis on the same scale as 2008 struck			2
mr @entity6 said : ‘ the threat of default by one country may trigger a generalised crisis			2
it will be in the interests of other countries in the union to bail out a country in crisis			0
