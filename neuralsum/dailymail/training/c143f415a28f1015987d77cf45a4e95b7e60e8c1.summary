by @entity1 reporter published : 20:36 est , 15 july 2012 updated : 21:30 est , 15 july 2012 they may have been bitter enemies during the @entity4 space race , but these days the @entity5 and @entity6 work together to transport astronauts through the cosmos			1
and it 's just as well - for since the demise of the space shuttle programme last year , @entity10 has been forced to piggy - back off other countries rockets for its space expeditions			1
this enforced co-operation was on show on sunday , when @entity5 @entity18 joined colleagues from @entity6 and @entity20 on a @entity22 capsule headed to the @entity23 for a four - month mission			1
the @entity28 rocket blazed a bright orange trail through cloudy skies above the @entity49 on the first stage of its journey to the @entity23 , a $ 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above @entity32			0
@entity53 hopes a successful mission will help to restore confidence in its once - pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year , including the failure of a mission to return samples from the @entity62			1
the previous @entity22 launch on may 15 was delayed by more than a month after an accident during pressure tests damaged the @entity22 crew capsule			2
there were no such delays with sunday 's launch			0
expensive trip : the @entity5 is dependent on @entity6 's @entity28 rockets to carry personnel to the @entity23 since it scrapped its space shuttle programme last year ' the most tense , the most difficult part ( of the launch ) has been successfully implemented , ' said @entity76 , head of @entity77 @entity77			1
' i have just spoken to the crew			2
they are feeling great , ' @entity6 news agencies quoted @entity76 as saying in @entity29			2
' i have no doubts that all will go according to plan			0
' colonel @entity33 , a 50 - year - old cosmonaut on his fifth space voyage , loosened his straps about 20 minutes after blast - off after conducting air pressure checks			2
asked by @entity88 how the crew was feeling , he replied : ' good			0
' a doll given to him by his daughter dangled from the roof of the capsule			0
intrepid : @entity6 cosmonaut @entity33 , center , @entity5 astronaut @entity18 , right , and @entity20 astronaut @entity34 , left , walk to the capsule before the countdown explorers : colonel @entity33 , left , and captain @entity18 , wave to the cameras prior to launch captain @entity18 , 46 , and mr @entity34 , 43 , a civilian engineer , are both on their second space flight and their first aboard a @entity22 spacecraft			1
they , along with @entity104 , are scheduled to return to @entity32 in mid-november			0
the previous crew of three at the @entity23 returned on july 1			0
cosmonaut @entity108 , @entity10 astronaut @entity109 and @entity110 astronaut @entity107 helped to dock the first privately owned spacecraft during a six - month stint in orbit			0
destination space : the @entity23 is a $ 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above @entity32 sunday 's launch took place less than three weeks after @entity120 's @entity119 spacecraft returned to @entity32 , ending a mission that put the country 's first woman in space			0
although @entity120 is far from catching up with the @entity5 and @entity6 , the @entity125 9 marked @entity120 's fourth manned space mission since 2003			1
it comes as budget restraints and shifting priorities have held back @entity5 manned space launches			1

@entity53 hopes to restore confidence in space programme
