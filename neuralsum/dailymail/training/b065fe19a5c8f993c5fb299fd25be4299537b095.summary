by @entity0 and @entity1 all eyes may be on @entity3 when he brings @entity5 ’s machiavellian @entity4 to life on stage – but for traditional theatregoers , the very worst villains are in the audience			1
fans of the @entity13 star have been accused of breaching ‘ theatre etiquette ’ by cheering the actor ’s very first scene , during which he delivers the soliloquy starting ‘ now is the winter of our discontent ’			1
conventionally , audiences break into applause only at the beginning of the interval and at the final curtain			1
@entity3 as @entity27 in @entity5 's play however , enthusiastic @entity13 fans , many of whom are first - time theatregoers , have been accused of ruining some of @entity5 ’s most spellbinding moments with their ‘ annoying ’ and ‘ disruptive ’ bursts of applause			1
one audience member , theatre blogger @entity34 , said last night : ‘ after the opening monologue some fans tried to kick off clapping and cheering , which i found to be disruptive and unnecessary			2
‘ there are strong views on this , but i was irritated when the audience interrupted the flow of the play to clap and cheer @entity3 ’s first scene			1
’ miss @entity34 , who was sitting in the front row for the show ’s preview at @entity49 ’s @entity48 , added : ‘ while i am not a traditionalist in terms of dramaturgy , i do believe in proper theatre etiquette			2
‘ it ’s a first preview and there were mistakes			2
i understand that @entity3 is popular , but i have no bigger pet peeve than everything getting standing ovations these days			1
’ as @entity13 fans know him , @entity3 plays @entity61 in the films based on @entity64 's books celebrated actress dame @entity65 agreed that applauding someone during the middle of a production was ‘ wrong ’			1
she said : ‘ it ultimately breaks the spell of the story			2
i think that what is happening is because of the success of @entity13			0
@entity3 is attracting a different kind of audience who are not used to the theatre			1
@entity78 is a big name , but i do n’t think that her audience would behave in that fashion			0
’ @entity82 , who co-starred opposite @entity83 in the @entity85 ’s 2011 production of @entity4 , said applauding a star during a play could be ‘ undemocratic ’			0
she added : ‘ if people clap at the beginning , then there is a danger they are being taken out of the story			0
it should not be about the famous person			0
it should be about the play and the role			0
’ and @entity98 , who is about to star in the @entity100 production of @entity101 , also blamed the over-zealous applause on the fact that @entity3 ’s starring role in @entity13 trilogy had attracted a much younger audience to the show			1
she said : ‘ @entity3 ’s face is on every bus in @entity49			1
the producers are going out to find the @entity13 audience			0
they are spending a fortune to target them			0
’ she added : ‘ the director tweeted the other day about the fact that the first two rows could expect to find themselves spattered in fake blood			2
‘ they are aiming for people who spend most of their day with wire in their ears			0
it is not so much @entity4 as @entity27 the rock concert			0
’ however , @entity127 - winning dramatist @entity126 , who is one of @entity129 ’s most successful playwrights , said he had no problem with people showing appreciation for actors in the middle of a play			0
mr @entity126 , whose hits include @entity137 and the musical @entity138 , said : ‘ attracting first - time theatregoers is the holy grail as far as we are all concerned			2
we want them to come as much as possible			0
’ he added : ‘ i love it when people applaud in the middle of the play			0
i am all for people having a good time in the theatre and if they want to express themselves like that , i do n’t see any harm in it			0
’ last night @entity3 , who has also appeared in tv hit @entity151 , was unavailable for comment , but @entity4 director @entity153 stepped in to defend the production ’s enthusiastic reception			1
he said : ‘ the show ’s standing ovations have been instant , to reward the entire cast , not just @entity3			1
they do n’t wait for @entity3 to come on for his bow			1
i think that we are seeing an authentic , enthusiastic reaction from a generational muddle in the audience			2
‘ younger , first - time theatregoers are more vocal and they are certainly screaming their appreciation at the end			1

younger fans break into round of applause when @entity3 appears much to annoyance of more *seasoned* theatregoers
@entity3 would not comment but show 's director defended enthusiastic *approach*
