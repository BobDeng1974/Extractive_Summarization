@entity0 continued his domination of the inaugural @entity3 @entity2 to claim the 38th pole position of his @entity6 career , but only after a major error from @entity9 ' @entity8			1
after finishing comfortably quickest in the second and third practice runs around @entity6 's newest venue , the @entity10 , @entity0 topped the timesheet in all three qualifying sessions			1
and will lead away the field on sunday			0
there was a scare , though , as @entity8 was fastest in the first two sectors of the track on his final flying lap , only to make errors over the final third to finish third behind @entity0 and @entity24 team - mate @entity23			1

@entity0 claims the 38th pole of his career			1
he appears to have the edge over @entity23 here , but what of @entity8 ? he was so close to splitting the @entity24 drivers until that error at the final corner			2
@entity3 @entity42 ; 2 @entity23 ; 3 @entity8 ; 4 @entity43 ; 5 @entity44 ; 6 @entity45 * , 7			1
vergne * @entity45 will serve five - place grid penalty @entity0 improves on his time with a 1:38.513 and @entity23 does n't have a response			1
but here is someone who can - it 's @entity8 who is faster than anyone in the middle sector but the @entity57 ca n't keep his @entity9 under control through the final corners and has to settle for 3rd			2
he could have taken pole there			2
@entity23 responds and is up in the middle sector , but he has a scruffy end to his lap and he is two tenths shy of his team - mate			1
@entity8 is 3rd with @entity43 in 4th and @entity46 5th for @entity67			0
but @entity0 is back on song and , for the moment , takes provisional pole with a 1:38.647			1
@entity0 also had a problem at @entity72 which would have compromised him through @entity73 and 12 , going some way to explaining his time			2
he is down in sixth , but is on another competitive lap.			0
. @entity48 is first over the line with a 1:41.5 ... but here comes @entity0 , he makes a mistake at turn 7 , but still goes fastest			2
@entity23 , however , trumps @entity0 by one second with a 1:38.946			1
@entity8 is second only a couple of tenths back			0
@entity0 is the first of the @entity24 drivers to take to the circuit			2
surely , the @entity84 wo n't be beaten today ? we 're underway in @entity10 and just 12 minutes away from finding out who will be on pole for the inaugural @entity3 @entity2			1
here 's a hugley disappointed @entity89 , who will start a miserable 18th tomorrow			2
' the only thing i know is that here was no power			0
there was a problem with the fuel pressure i think			0
i was trying to talk to them to get the power back in the engine but it was not possible			0
' so , @entity0 finished the session almost three tenths clear of @entity23			1
over at @entity67 and @entity105 was three tenths slower than @entity46 ... @entity105 falls at the @entity107 hurdle			2
he will start only 11th tomorrow			0
@entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity105 and @entity112 in the bottom six with one minute remaining ... @entity105 improves on his time , but it is only good enough to promote him one place to 14th			1
does the four - time @entity116 have some sort of problem ? @entity67 were expecting to struggle this weekend , but not by this much , surely ? @entity46 is 7th , over a second quicker than his team - mate ... but as i say that , @entity47 slots in to @entity123 and @entity48 is eighth fastest			0
@entity105 is way down the order in 15th			2
@entity23 improves on his time , but he is still a quarter of a second shy of @entity0			1
the @entity126 pair of @entity48 and @entity47 meanwhile are out of the top 10 with only five minutes left			2
@entity8 currently splits the @entity24 with some six minutes remaining			0
the @entity57 really has been one of the breakthrough performers of this season			0
but what of @entity0 ? here comes the championship leader and he is @entity131 faster than @entity23 and co. it looks as though @entity0 has really stepped up a gear as he bids to win his first championship since 2008			1
@entity45 slots into second and is only four thousandths of a second of @entity23 's best time			1
@entity139 appear to be back on form here			0
@entity43 then goes almost seven tenths quicker than his former @entity139 team - mate only for @entity23 to go fastest with a 1:38.9 , four tenths quicker than @entity43			1
@entity108 is the first man over the line in the second part of qualifying with a 1:40.1			0
the 15 - minute session , to determine which drivers go through to the top - 10 shootout , in @entity10 is underway			1
a nice touch from @entity151 ( @entity151 ) , who control the tv feed , to display a message of support to @entity156 on the exit of the final corner			2
@entity0 ends the session three tenths clear of @entity23 , with @entity8 , in the sister @entity9 , the best of the rest in @entity164			1
lots of concerned faces down at @entity9 as the chequered flag falls and @entity89 fails to improve on his time			0
and to make matters worse , @entity169 goes faster than the former @entity126 man			0
@entity89 will start only 18th tomorrow			0
@entity89 : ' you need to do something			0
i can not do anything			0
' the exasperated @entity176 is readying himself for one final run , but he really appears to be down on speed			0
@entity89 posts his best lap of the afternoon , but it is only good enough for @entity182 - the @entity176 , battling a problem with his @entity9 , is in real danger of missing out on @entity107 here			0
with only three minutes remaining , pastor @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and a struggling @entity89 occupy the bottom five places			0
@entity0 goes three tenths quicker than @entity23 as we see the @entity192 making a mistake at @entity72 after running wide			1
a 1:38.759 from @entity194 is only marginally slower than his best lap of the morning session			0
and @entity23 goes even quicker on the soft compound ; some two tenths better than his first flyer			2
@entity43 meanwhile is in fifth , running on the slower medium compound			0
a good effort from the @entity203 driver , still chasing a seat next season			0
but @entity23 responds to his team - mate 's time with a 1:39.292 which is almost seven tenths quicker than @entity0			1
@entity210 is third with the mclarens of @entity45 and @entity43 fourth and fifth respectively			0
but here comes the in - form @entity0 , who despite a lock - up , goes more than a second quicker than the @entity3			1
@entity43 , who has impressed for @entity139 this weekend , posts the fastest time of the session so far , only to be trumped by home favourite @entity216 in his @entity218			0
@entity0 is the first of the frontrunners to take to the track			2
@entity0 is on the soft tyre , which would suggest @entity24 are not confident they 'll be able to make it through to @entity107 on the slower , medium compound			1
with @entity226 entering only one car , it 's worth noting that only five cars will be eliminated from this opening session			0
the pit lane is open and the opening 18 - minute session is underway in @entity10			1
the drivers are strapped in their cockpits and ready for qualifying for tomorrow ’s @entity3 @entity2			1
we will be underway in a couple of minutes			0
the @entity236 is the newest venue to join the @entity6 calendar , with the track winding its way through the site that hosted the @entity242 earlier this year			2
the organisers are proudly boasting it to be the only track in the world to be located in an @entity248 venue , and the only one to be both permanent and a street circuit as it integrates into @entity10 's general infrastructure during non-racing periods			1
at 5.853km in length , it is the third longest circuit on the current calendar behind @entity256 ( 5.891km ) and @entity257 ( 7.004km )			0
although a street circuit , cars are expected to hit speeds of 200mph on the main straight between turns one and two			0
the @entity3 @entity2 weekend got off to the best of starts for @entity203 racing after @entity266 stormed to a lights - to - flag victory in this morning ’s gp3 race			1
after securing pole , the young @entity84 led from the front before posting the fastest lap , too			1
all of this on his debut for the @entity275 team ; incredibly impressive			0
@entity156 's crash was so shocking that it 's almost difficult to put into words			1
i was informed of the severity of his accident by the @entity281 immediately after the @entity282 @entity2 ; that it was extremely serious and as such the race result became completely irrelevant			1
you would have seen that @entity0 , @entity105 and i did not spray any champagne on the podium			1
it was n't a time to celebrate			0
@entity288 exclusive : @entity203 television coverage of the @entity290 - the most security - conscious race ever staged - could go blank moments before @entity294 arrives at the @entity10 on sunday			1
back on track and @entity0 has so far carried his good form through to @entity3 after setting a searing pace in this morning ’s final practice session			1
despite a late spin , the @entity84 was the best part of three tenths clear of team - mate and rival for the championship @entity23 , as he bids for his fourth straight win			1
it ’s been a difficult week for all of those connected with the sport of @entity6 with @entity156 in hospital following his horror crash at the @entity282 @entity2			1
the @entity6 paddock has returned to work this week , albeit with a heavy heart , for the inaugural @entity3 @entity2 just days after @entity156 was left with a severe head trauma after he ploughed into the back of a tractor			1
the drivers will sport tributes to @entity156 , fighting for his life in @entity319 , with stickers on their crash helmets			2
@entity322 , the @entity218 driver , countryman and close friend of @entity156 , summed up the mood in the paddock when he poignantly said : ‘ i am not going to race for me			2
i am not going to race for my team			0
i am going to race for him ’ .			0

@entity0 edged out @entity23 to secure pole for the inaugural race in @entity3
the @entity84 is 10 points ahead of @entity23 with four races remaining
he 's bidding for fourth straight win after @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity282
@entity105 failed to make it through to top - 10 shootout in @entity10
@entity6 races on after @entity156 's horror crash at @entity282 @entity2
