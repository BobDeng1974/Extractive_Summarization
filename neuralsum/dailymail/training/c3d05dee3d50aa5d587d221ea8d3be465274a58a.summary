it was around the dinner table on @entity2 , during a conversation with his fiancee , when @entity6 realised how his game had malfunctioned			1
he had just arrived home from a difficult afternoon at @entity10 , a game @entity12 won 1 - 0			1
his return to action had been unexpected , as @entity15 suffered an early injury , but when the @entity18 goalkeeper came on he was indecisive and his performance lacked confidence and conviction			1
@entity6 had missed @entity12 ’s three previous matches			1
@entity23 was vexed by his form and felt a spell out the team , starting against @entity27 , would benefit him but as he shanked clearances and conceded needless corners at @entity31 , nothing appeared to have changed			1
@entity6 realised he had stopped doing the things that had persuaded @entity12 to pay @entity46 £ 9million for his services			1
once he had clarity , the fight back could begin			2
‘ my family were over and my missus and everyone were having dinner , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ she said “ @entity6 are you sometimes overthinking stuff ? ” those were her words			1
she comes to every game			2
i said we think about things , but i did n’t really give a response at the time			2
‘ she knows when to speak about football to me and when to leave me alone			0
the moment she came up with that and then next day the coaching staff gave me the same words			0
that was the trigger in my mind that we had to say " look , we have to sort this out "			0
‘ the next day i went into training and again we analysed the game			0
i was always looking to find best possible solution for situations			0
i was trying to find the right pass but i had forgotten what the worst solution could be			0
i have always tended to over think things and that came into my game			0
’ the @entity18 , working hard on crosses during a training session on thursday , was dropped in december the @entity18 keeper rushes off his line to deny @entity37 scoring for @entity34 on tuesday it had been a horrid season for @entity6 , one that had been filled with criticism from all quarters			1
some of it bordered on the vindictive , particularly the insults from former @entity12 keeper @entity94 who risibly likened him to @entity95			1
other words , notably from @entity97 and @entity98 , also hurt but it is to his credit that he does not want to settle any scores during this conversation			0
he would be within his rights to shoot back but he has made himself the bigger man , particular where @entity94 is concerned			2
‘ from all the criticism i have had , you pick the things you can take on board and you pick the things you can leave alone , ’ says @entity6			1
so would he shake @entity94 ’s hand if he seen him ? the 26 - year - old has been in impressive form since returning to the @entity12 side on @entity115 last year @entity6 will face competition for the no 1 jersey from @entity15 ( second left ) who has returned to training ‘ yes , of course , ’ comes the instant reply			1
‘ i appreciate what he has done for the club and he has been a legend all the way through his life			0
he has won major trophies for @entity12			2
i will respect him for that			0
i respect every goalkeeper who has done the job as i know what the job is			2
‘ as a footballer the only thing you can do is show what you can do on the pitch and answers the questions on the field			0
i ’ve never reacted when there has been criticism , and i ’ll never do that in the future			0
you learn from that experience			0
you can become better for it			0
’ @entity6 , certainly , has become better in recent weeks and his input to the win against @entity34 on tuesday was crucial , when he made a spectacular save to thwart @entity148			1
if @entity12 are to get beyond the @entity151 fifth round this evening at @entity152 , his good form must continue			1
‘ the manager has shown his faith in me and confidence in me and he believes in me , ’ says @entity6			2
when you play for a big club , people will have their eye on you and to see when you concede a goal , could he have done better ? that will always be the case and i accept that			0
