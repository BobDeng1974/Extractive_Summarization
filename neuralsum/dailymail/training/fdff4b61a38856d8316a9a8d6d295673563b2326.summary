by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ for some reason , the @entity1 makes managers do the strangest things			0
perhaps it is the pressure of football at the elite level			0
anyone with a passing knowledge of @entity11 ’s head coach @entity10 would describe this genial man as a naturally conservative and cautious manager			1
he has built a 40 - year coaching career off the back of it and you will do well to find anyone with a better working knowledge of the game ’s tactics and systems			0
whatever blows your hair back			0
@entity11 knew who they were appointing when they offered him the top job after @entity39 limply walked away two years ago			2
based on @entity10 's behavioural patterns over the years , he is not a guy who would instinctively jeopardise his team ’s chances in the opening game of a @entity1 in @entity45			1
we are unlikely to be back here in our lifetime and yet , last saturday , he abandoned the principles that have served him so well and risked it all against @entity52 ’s side			0
@entity11 are playing catch - up			2
in a varied coaching career , @entity10 is known throughout the world for getting the best out of limited resources			2
he is a pragmatist - that ’s what he does and he does it well			0
his training ground methodology , which involves endless drills and work on positional play , is legendary among his players			0
when a mistake is made , it is not unknown for @entity10 to take the ball right back to the very beginning			2
these , undoubtedly , are the tools that got him the @entity11 job in the first place			2
in recent times @entity10 succeeded with @entity75 and took @entity76 on a magical run to the @entity79 final against @entity80			2
at @entity81 , where the history of the club means the demands are very different , he was sacked after only six months in charge			0
kiss of death : @entity27 's @entity87 celebrates after condemning @entity11 to defeat in @entity89 at the back post : @entity87 scores the winner for @entity27 in their 2 - 1 victory over @entity11 in @entity94 in @entity1 conditions , the sense of alarm and panic about every petty little detail is heightened			1
for some reason , with a defence that everybody knows is suspect at the very highest level , @entity10 tried to blow @entity27 away in the opening game			1
the question is , what possessed him ? we now know , after assistant manager @entity110 ’s illuminating interview with 5 @entity111 on monday evening , that @entity10 abandoned his naturally cautious approach			1
the reality is that a draw , particularly after @entity116 ’s surprise 3 - 1 victory over @entity118 earlier in the day , would have done just fine			1
there was no pressure to beat the four time world champions in the opening game , none at all			2
his team selection , with @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 playing just behind the goalscoring threat of @entity130 , felt like life or death			0
at one point during the 2 - 1 defeat in @entity89 , @entity110 turned to @entity11 ’s goalkeeper coach @entity135 and compared the strategy to a @entity1 quarter - final			1
it was boom or bust			0
@entity110 went on to praise @entity11 ’s head coach for being bold and brave and introducing the element of risk			2
the reality is that @entity10 risked it all			1
on from the start : @entity11 's @entity127 ( right ) controls the ball as @entity27 's @entity148 looks on @entity149 : @entity10 ( right ) and coach @entity110 stand in the mixed zone after the defeat on saturday no - one can remember @entity10 , who is a solid , dependable and reliable man , being quite so gung - ho throughout his entire coaching career			1
@entity153 , who has just won his second @entity155 title with @entity156 , has been completely frozen out			1
this is a player with pedigree , a recent history of success and a man who finished the season strong with @entity156			0
arguably he was @entity163 ’s best player in the title run - in			0
after the game on saturday night , @entity10 spoke of working hard on the training ground ahead of the clash with @entity118 to rectify some defensive frailties			1
the truth is that there is no time			0
@entity11 ’s players were conditioned at their @entity174 and @entity175 training camps during an intensive build up to the tournament			0
on the sidelines : @entity11 's @entity153 ( centre front ) has been completely frozen out by @entity10 working hard : @entity11 players train on monday as they prepare for the crunch clash against @entity118 all set : @entity118 's @entity183 trains on monday ahead of his return to the team that ’s when the hard work , the tactical preparation and organisation , was meant to be done			1
here in @entity45 it is too late			0
after a warm down day following a four - hour flight back to @entity192 from @entity89 on sunday , @entity11 ’s players were put through a light session on monday			1
on tuesday there was some heavy duty tactical work based on the assumption that @entity183 will start alongside @entity197 forward @entity198 in the @entity199			1
@entity183 ’s presence is another example of @entity10 deviating from an accepted practice under intense , sometimes intolerable tournament pressures			1
on a whiteboard after @entity11 drew with @entity206 at the @entity207 in @entity175 , the players were told not to talk about individual @entity209 players , namely @entity148			0
a few days later , when @entity10 appeared drained in the mixed zone at the @entity213 , he was asked whether @entity183 was a genuine world class player			1
@entity10 responded by challenging the @entity81 striker to prove it , which can only have increased the @entity218 ’s motivation when he faces five of his club team - mates on thursday			0
@entity11 can not afford to lose this game and @entity10 knows that he has put himself in a tight spot at this tournament			1
finding a way out of it will be some achievement .			0

*hodgson* a naturally conservative and cautious manager
repetition built @entity10 's reputation
however , he risked it all against @entity27 in @entity89
a draw would have been just fine , especially after @entity116 beat @entity118
@entity153 has been totally frozen out by @entity10
there is no time to work on @entity11 's defensive frailties
@entity11 assuming @entity183 and @entity198 will start for @entity118
