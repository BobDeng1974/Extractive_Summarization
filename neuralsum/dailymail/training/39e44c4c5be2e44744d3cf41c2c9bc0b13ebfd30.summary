by @entity0 a bakery has been ordered to pay more than £ 23,000 to a former worker after an employment tribunal found she had been sacked for becoming pregnant			1
@entity4 , 24 , took the sex discrimination case against @entity7 bakery in @entity8 after she was dismissed around a week after telling her employer she was going to have a baby			1
the company claimed that its decision to let miss @entity4 go last april , just two months after taking her on , was based on her conduct and performance			1
the panel also accepted a claim by @entity32 , who was supported in bringing the case by the @entity34 , that she was told at her initial job interview not to get pregnant or married in her first year in the job			1
although an employee with less than 12 months ’ continuous employment can not usually bring a claim of unfair dismissal , this is not the case where the reason is related to pregnancy			2
miss @entity4 , who went on to give birth to daughter @entity16 , was awarded £ 7,500 for injury to her feelings and £ 15,788 compensation for loss of earnings			1
@entity4 was only with the bakery for two months before she told them she was with child ' i was delighted when i got the job and believed that it would be long term , ' she said			1
' i was told it would take about six months to get me up to speed with the job			0
around the end of march i found out i was pregnant and i spoke to one of the owners at the start of april and told her about it			2
she suggested that i think about whether it was best for me to continue working or if i ’d be better off leaving			0
i did n’t want to leave , i was happy to work and i was devastated when i was dismissed a week later			2
' i am glad the tribunal has found in my favour and now i just want to get on with my life with my little daughter			0
' although an employee with less than 12 months ’ continuous employment can not usually bring a claim of unfair dismissal , this is not the case where the reason is related to pregnancy as was the case with @entity4 dr @entity73 , the chief commissioner at the @entity34 , said that the laws governing pregnancy and maternity issues in the workplace were essential to protect the rights and support the needs of women in the workplace			1
' as a society , we need to ensure that women who become pregnant do n’t lose their employment and that they can resume their careers after their maternity leave without discrimination , ' he said			0
' @entity89 still receives more complaints about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace than about any other form of gender discrimination			0
' we also carry out a lot of work with employers , providing advice and guidance about the regulations governing pregnancy and maternity , work / life balance and flexible working			0
we find that most employers want to know what the law requires and how they can make sure they are providing fair treatment and equality for all their workers			0
' employers can find that offering flexible working arrangements opens up a wider pool of talent for posts and increases the commitment and loyalty of staff who benefit from it			0
