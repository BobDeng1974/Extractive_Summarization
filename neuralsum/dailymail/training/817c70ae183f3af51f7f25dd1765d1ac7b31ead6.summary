@entity1 's decision to make the @entity3 the central theme of @entity5 ’s general election campaign was dealt a series of heavy blows yesterday			1
two former @entity5 health secretaries raised fears about the strategy , and new figures showed a dramatic surge in public satisfaction with the @entity14 – especially among @entity5 voters			1
on a disastrous day for the @entity5 leader who has said he will ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity3 during the campaign : ÷ figures leaked to the @entity19 show the number of people satisfied with the @entity14 is at its second highest ever level , while unhappiness is at a record low			1
÷ @entity41 warned that political parties needed to be careful about doom - laden language on the @entity3			1
÷ and mr @entity1 came under further pressure over the poor state of the @entity5 - run @entity3 in @entity46 , where waiting times for @entity48 , operations and ambulance response are far worse than in @entity51			1
yesterday the @entity5 leader claimed the @entity3 was facing its most perilous moment in a generation , while shadow health secretary @entity54 claimed it was on a downward spiral			1
but figures from the annual @entity58 survey , to be published later this week by health think - tank @entity60 , showed that 65 per cent of people were happy with the way the @entity14 worked			2
that is up five points in a year and beaten only once before , in 2010			0
dissatisfaction , meanwhile , fell in 2014 to a record low of 15 per cent			0
the biggest surge in satisfaction with the @entity3 is among @entity5 voters , where there has been an 11 point increase to 69 per cent			1
satisfaction among @entity74 supporters is up by five points to 68 per cent , and is static among conservatives at 67 per cent			0
the survey , which has been conducted since 1983 , found that satisfaction with outpatient services is at an all - time high of 69 per cent			2
accident and emergency services experienced an increase in satisfaction to 58 per cent , from last year ’s low point of 53 per cent , despite controversy over failures to meet waiting - time targets in recent months			2
however , while gp services remain the most popular @entity3 service in terms of satisfaction , their rating of 71 per cent in 2014 is the lowest since the survey began			2
satisfaction with dentists remains lower than with other @entity3 services , with 54 per cent of respondents happy			2
and happiness with social care services is far lower than with the @entity3 , with just 31 per cent of respondents content and 30 per cent dissatisfied			0
experts say the unexpected rise in overall satisfaction ratings is significant , although they caution that some of it may be due to voters ’ desire to express support for the institution			0
mr @entity54 , in a speech at @entity60 to launch his party ’s new ten - year manifesto for health , insisted : ‘ if we do n’t change course , the crisis we are seeing now in @entity48 and the ambulance service will become entrenched in the @entity3			1
’ @entity1 ’s comparison to the dopey @entity119 model @entity117 is one he has always tried to distance himself from			0
but he may face a fresh round of jokes now @entity122 , which created @entity117 and @entity117 , has included a character in its new film with an uncanny resemblance to the @entity5 leader			0
uncanny : new character from @entity122 ' new film ( left ) , and @entity5 leader @entity1 ( right ) the trailer for @entity130 reveals a displeased waiter with more than a passing likeness to mr @entity1 – and with under 100 days until the election , the film ’s release next month is less than timely for the opposition leader			1
in the last @entity138 , @entity137 took a swipe at mr @entity1 , saying : ‘ the man behind @entity117 ’s voice has retired			0
but after next may i am sure the whole @entity143 will unite behind a suitable and , by then , available candidate			0
’ he warned that if the @entity32 won the election , ‘ the next @entity146 could see the @entity3 sunk by a toxic mix of cuts , crisis and privatisation ’			1
@entity5 may hit private healthcare companies with a new levy to help pay for training extra @entity3 staff , and is proposing to integrate care for the elderly into the @entity3 in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals caused by inadequate community support			1
mr @entity1 repeated a pledge made last year to hire 36,000 extra health staff , paid for with an additional £ 2.5billion a year from a new tax on expensive homes , a levy on tobacco firms and a crackdown on tax avoidance			2
however , the @entity5 leader also appeared to suggest his ‘ mansion tax ’ would be used to help pay down the deficit even though it has already been earmarked for @entity3 spending			1
his push on the @entity3 was further undermined by an extraordinary attack from mr @entity34 , who was a health secretary under @entity177 and is a leading @entity179 figure			2
he said @entity5 ’s focus on extra funding for the @entity3 without plans to deliver necessary reform could prove to be a fatal mistake , and showed the party was sticking too closely to its comfort zone			1
@entity1 said @entity188 's move to bring in private firms to run energy companies should not be the future model for the @entity3 @entity188 ’s privatisations of state - owned facilities in the @entity194 were botched , @entity1 suggested yesterday			1
he said the move to bring private firms in to run services such as energy should not be used as a model for the future of the @entity3			0
referring to part of the @entity32 ’ @entity201 , he said : ‘ @entity203 actually said the model for the @entity3 should be the great success of the privatised utilities in the @entity194			2
now , we know where that got us , do n’t we ? ’ tories claimed the remarks showed the @entity5 leader instinctively favoured state intervention			0
but speaking in @entity212 , @entity213 , he said he had no intention of taking utilities back to state ownership , adding : ‘ no. that ’s not our plan and it ’s never been our plan			0
‘ what ’s important is to recognise what this government is doing in relation to the @entity14			0
they thought the model of competition , privatisation , fragmentation was the answer			0
’ @entity231 , of the @entity232 , said : ‘ of all @entity188 ’s achievements , it is easy to forget how successful was her programme of privatisation			0
' not only did the taxpayer benefit , but so did the consumer – in lower prices and better service			0
’ ‘ there is a risk that @entity5 ’s position on the @entity3 becomes almost an emblem for @entity5 showing an unwillingness to lean into a difficult reform agenda , ’ he told @entity243 ’s @entity242			2
@entity41 , mr @entity54 ’s predecessor as health secretary under @entity251 , warned of the political risks of sounding doom - laden on the @entity3			1
he told the @entity253 : ‘ there are risks – and i know from my constituents that if you criticise the @entity3 in a way that the public believes is actually undermining it then you run a political risk			0
’ in @entity46 , @entity5 has presided over long waiting times for vital tests and life - saving treatment			1
a key cancer waiting time target has not been met since 2008			0
but mr @entity1 bizarrely claimed the @entity3 performance in @entity46 could only be compared to when the @entity32 were last in power before 1997 , rather than to the service in @entity51 .			1

@entity1 attacked @entity32 over handling of the health service in speech
but figures show support for @entity3 is high - especially among @entity5 voters
party *veteran* @entity41 also warned against @entity3 doom - mongering
meanwhile @entity46 @entity3 - which @entity1 wants to copy - misses targets
