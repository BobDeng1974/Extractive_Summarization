schoolchildren who constantly feel they are the smartest in the class tend to be disliked by their fellow pupils , researchers have found			0
using a round - robin design , the researchers asked each student to rate their classmates , in terms of their likability and of their feelings of academic superiority ( i.e. rating on a scale '' i feel academically superior to him / her '' )			1
they the contrasted those ratings with the students ' grades in math , physics , @entity34 , and @entity35			1
importantly , they conducted the analysis at two different social levels : ' habitual ' - the way people act in general - and ' relationship ' - the way someone acts around a specific individual			0
november 12 , 2014 - ' i am the smartest kid in class			0
' we all want our kids to be self - confident , but unrealistic perceptions of their academic abilities can be harmful			0
in fact , unrealistic views , a new study of eighth - graders finds , can damage the a child 's relationship with others in the classroom			1
' there is more to being labeled a nerd than just academic achievement , ' said @entity62 of the @entity63 in @entity64 , who led the research			0
' i really got interested in the question of whether it is ok to brag about achievements in class or if you should rather not display your achievements in the classroom			0
' the research looked at something psychologists call ' self - enhancement ' - when a person feels unrealistically superior to someone else			1
the poster child for self - enhancement is the character @entity81 on @entity10			1
' although @entity81 is a smart person and receives respect for his scientific work , he still thinks that he is even smarter , brighter , or much better as compared to how he is perceived by others , ' says @entity62 , who is currently a visiting scholar at @entity87			0
@entity62 and her colleague @entity88 decided to take a closer look at how such self - enhancement affects relationships			0
they turned to an eighth - grade classroom to measure differences between actual academic performance , students ' perceptions of their performance , and social popularity			2
the 358 students came from 20 eighth - grade classes in schools in southeast @entity64			2
using a round - robin design , the researchers asked each student to rate their classmates , in terms of their likability and of their feelings of academic superiority ( i.e. rating on a scale '' i feel academically superior to him / her '' )			1
they the contrasted those ratings with the students ' grades in math , physics , @entity34 , and @entity35			2
importantly , they conducted the analysis at two different social levels : ' habitual ' - the way people act in general - and ' relationship ' - the way someone acts around a specific individual			0
the @entity10 with @entity130 and @entity11 as @entity12			1
the research looked at something psychologists call ' self - enhancement ' - when a person feels unrealistically superior to someone else			1
the differences between these two levels of analysis were stark : students who tended to have an inflated view of themselves at the habitual level were neither more or less liked by their classmates			2
however , self - inflation toward specific individuals changed how the students felt about each other			2
' the more a student felt unrealistically superior to a specific other student , the less he or she was liked by the other student in return , ' wrote the researchers in a new study in @entity155			1
interestingly , at both the habitual and relationship levels , students who self - enhanced disliked their classmates more than those with more realistic views of themselves			2
the results show , @entity62 says , that ' the specific relationship between individuals matters when it comes to the social consequences of self - enhancement			0
' when a person acts superior to someone else specifically , it can be offensive , whereas if someone has an inflated sense of themselves all the time toward everyone , it feels less personal , they say .			1
