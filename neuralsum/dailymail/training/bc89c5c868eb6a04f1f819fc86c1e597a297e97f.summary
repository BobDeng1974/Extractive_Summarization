the parents of a severely - epileptic boy have found a life - altering treatment for his painful syndrome			2
@entity4 and @entity6 's son @entity5 was diagnosed with @entity7 , an illness which causes the 10 - year - old boy to suffer 10 to 100 seizures a day			1
but after moving to @entity10 , @entity5 can now go days without a single seizure thanks to a special strain of marijuana called @entity14 , named after the famous children 's book			1
over the years , the @entity17 have tried over 20 drugs , a brain lobectomy and extreme diets to treat @entity5 's syndrome but still the seizures persisted			1
pictured above with mom @entity4 ( right ) and 13 - year - old brother @entity30 ( left ) in their @entity31 , @entity10 home wonder drug : @entity5 and his mother moved to @entity10 from @entity36 so they could use a special strain of medical marijuana called @entity14 , which other families have found helpful in limiting seizures with their children they were running out of hope last year , when @entity5 reached ' expiration age , a point at which the seizures become increasingly frequent and deadly			1
that 's when they heard about the revolutionary strain of medical marijuana oil that was being used to treat other children like @entity5			1
@entity14 was developed five years ago by @entity10 company @entity54 , as a drug for cancer patients			1
the strain was once called ' @entity58 ' since it does n't get users high , due to a lower amount of @entity61 and higher amount of @entity63 ( @entity64 )			2
medical authorities still have not found conclusive evidence that @entity64 limits seizures , but the @entity17 have seen the good it can do after just one month			2
@entity6 was hesitant to give his child the drug at first , however , since he has worked for the @entity70 for 26 years and currently is in charge of their drug evidence inventory			0
' i was real nervous about what my peers would think about me doing this , ' mr @entity6 told the @entity78			0
' i finally came to the conclusion that if there is a chance that this product could help my child , then you 've got to do it			0
' hesitation : mr @entity6 was hesitant to use the drug on his son at first , since he has worked in law enforcement for the last 26 years and currently is in charge of the @entity70 's drug evidence inventory			0
but they tried @entity14 as a last ditch effort and saw improvement almost immediately			2
mrs @entity93 ( left ) says her son ( right ) can now go days without a seizure mrs @entity93 moved to @entity31 with @entity5 and his 13 - year - old brother @entity30 in december while mr @entity6 stayed at home to continue to work			1
the @entity17 put @entity5 on a waiting list and were cleared to start using @entity14 for the first time on may 31			1
they noticed an instant improvement since @entity102 could go whole days without a single seizure			1
in april , mrs @entity93 spoke with @entity105 news station @entity104 over @entity106 , detailing how her son 's improving quality of life			0
' he 's not having hundreds of seizures in the last week			0
it 's huge for us , ' she said			0
' and that may not last			0
we 're not saying it 's a miracle cure , but it means a world of difference for us			0
' today , more than 400 families are using @entity14 to treat their seizure - prone condition and thousands more are on a waiting list			1
many , like the @entity17 , have found the drug to be useful , but others have not been so lucky			0
mrs @entity93 says she knows a few families who have left @entity10 after the drug failed to help their children			2
and doctors at @entity10 say some patients have had negative experiences using the drug , and been submitted to the intensive care unit / dr @entity132 , who runs the @entity133 , is one of the doctors who has started early testing of the drug in its use with children			2
' it 's common for people hearing incredibly wonderful anecdotal stories to feel like they know the answer , and no one should like today , based on the data , that anyone has any of the answers about safety or efficacy , ' dr @entity132 told the @entity78 .			0

@entity24 , 10 , was diagnosed with @entity7 , an illness which causes him to suffer 10 - 100 seizures a day
his family moved to @entity10 in december so he could use a special strain of medical marijuana called @entity14
he was *allowed* his first dose at the end of may and his family noticed an almost immediate improvement
now @entity5 can go days without suffering a single seizure
