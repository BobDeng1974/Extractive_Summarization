even the coldest - hearted @entity0 would be melted by these adorable @entity2 animals			2
dressed in @entity4 hats or playing with tinsel the merry models start their careers early - aged just six weeks old			2
and it 's a fine art for photographer @entity9 , from @entity10 , who has to distract the kittens and puppies just enough so they do n't eat the props			1
growing up in @entity36 mr @entity9 said he was surrounded by some very unusual animals his mother used to photograph			1
mr @entity9 , 48 , who together with dad @entity40 run the family firm @entity42 , in @entity10 , said continuing his mother 's work was a lovely experience			1
he said : ' growing up in @entity46 in @entity36 as a child we used to have a tame fox , a badger , an iguana and even a type of crocodile called a caiman			2
the kids would love to come to our house because it was like a zoo			0
give us a slice ! the photographer has mastered the art of getting different animals to work together @entity63 : this little lamb does not seem to think much of his @entity4 hat dog tired : dressed in @entity4 hats or playing with tinsel the animals start their merry modelling careers aged just six weeks old peekaboo ! the photographer is following in the footsteps of his renowned photographer mum @entity34 who passed away in 2007 ' i 'm not sure this suits me ' : the photgapher said continuing his mother 's work was ' a lovely experience ' ... although this chap does n't look so sure ' at first i was n't as keen on photography , we spent some time as a family in @entity85			1
my sister @entity86 and i would spend what seemed like hours in the back of a @entity89 while mum waited to get a picture of a lion or something			0
' but i actually picked up a camera about 15 years ago when i was in @entity96 while my ex-wife taught there , mum said to me as something to do why do n't i do landscape pictures for them			0
where are the huskies when you need them ? @entity9 has now become known as ' the master of cuteness ' for his work with animals nuts about @entity2 : this cheeky little chap wo n't be telling anyone where he has squirreled his presents away until the big day ' the @entity96 landscape is stunning on the western coast and i think i got the bug from there			1
doing the cute animal pictures now is a great privilege and i am proud to continue mum 's work			0
' @entity9 said using @entity2 hats and props with his furry subjects was a challenge especially as most of the time they tried to eat them			1
it was n't us : these two look like they may been caught up in some trouble as they play with @entity2 decorations he said : ' the natural reaction of a kitten is to lift its paw up and try and take the hat off and eat the bobble			0
' luckily as well as inheriting mum 's talent for cute animal pictures i also have her assistant @entity143 who is great at keeping them distracted just long enough to get the picture			0
