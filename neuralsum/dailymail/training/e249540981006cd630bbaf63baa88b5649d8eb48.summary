a family of beavers is to continue living free on a @entity4 river , officials have ruled			1
ministers wanted the remarkable animals , believed to be the first wild beavers to breed in @entity8 for 800 years , to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year			1
but @entity8 , the government agency in charge of wildlife , has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind			1
beavers wo n't be budging : a family of beavers is to continue living free on a @entity4 river after @entity8 , the government agency in charge of wildlife , has decided they wo n't be put in a zoo , but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind @entity25 , which will run the pilot project for the next five years , welcomed the decision as a ‘ great day for conservation in @entity8 ’			1
there are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12mile ( 19km ) stretch of the @entity32 near @entity33			1
they have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years , completely unnoticed until just over a year ago			1
it is an extraordinary environmental success story , for which green groups and conservationists can take no credit			0
nobody knows where they came from – but they are certainly thriving without any outside interference			0
so environmentalists were furious when @entity46 , the government ’s environment department , decided last year that they would round up the beavers			1
there are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12 mile ( 19km ) stretch of the @entity32 near @entity33 ( shown on a map )			1
they have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years , completely unnoticed until just over a year ago @entity56 of the @entity25 said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers , reducing numbers of trees on the banks , improving light levels , and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams			1
some people think they may slow down flood waters , as well as boosting wildlife diversity			0
farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes			0
officials said that they posed a risk to other wildlife , and might spread parasites and disease			0
they ordered the beavers to be caged and either rehomed or culled , prompting a fierce campaign to allow the animals to remain free , backed by more than 12,000 people			2
the threat of a zoo or worse has now been averted			2
the beavers will be carefully tested for disease this spring and , as long as they are free of disease , will be allowed to stay on the @entity32			1
@entity90 , a retired environmental scientist who spotted the first beaver on the banks of the @entity32 a year ago , said : ‘ i am very grateful to all those people who have given their support to saving our beavers			1
‘ currently there are few signs of the beaver on the river @entity101 , no dams or lodges , but beaver can do such a lot more to help improve the environment and now they have been given the chance , i 'm looking forward very much to helping them show people just what they can do			0
’ but he said the @entity112 must be very careful when they trap the beavers to test them for diseases in the coming weeks			1
he said : ‘ there is still grave concerns regarding trapping the beavers , including the significant risk of drowning them and ensuring the safety of the kits who still rely on their parents for their survival			2
‘ none of the @entity127 people licenced to trap the beavers have direct beaver skills or experience			2
’ beavers , which are native to @entity8 , were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the @entity135			1
they vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until , mysteriously , one was spotted near @entity139 in eastern @entity4 last winter			1
a few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile			0
the @entity143 revealed in november that there are three generations living on the @entity32 , with at least ten individuals			1

a few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile			0
a screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown ‘ @entity8 has very carefully considered the @entity25 application against international standards , and has decided that a licence will be issued permitting the managed release into the wild of beavers currently resident in the @entity32 , on a five year trial basis , ' a @entity46 spokesman said			1
' this decision is subject to the beavers being tested and found to be free of @entity166 parasite			1
‘ our priority is to ensure humane treatment for the beavers while safeguarding human health , that ’s why we will be working with the @entity25 to capture and test the animals before the trial begins			2
’ this proves that they have been quietly prospering and – crucially – breeding			0
experts think they must have been there for at least five years , unnoticed			1
as well as being a rare victory for native @entity183 wildlife , conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment			0
@entity56 of the @entity25 said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers , reducing numbers of trees on the banks , improving light levels , and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams			0
he said : ‘ we are really pleased that we have obtained this step forward			0
‘ it is a really important day for conservation in @entity8 , a really great day for conservation in @entity8			2
we are looking forward to making this trial a success			0
’ @entity204 , @entity8 chairman , whose board agreed to give @entity25 the licence for the project , said : ‘ reintroduction of a species is a complicated and emotive subject and we have considered this application very carefully			2
‘ we are now satisfied with @entity25 ’s plans for managing and monitoring the project , which will allow important evidence to be gathered during the trial on any impacts which the beavers may have			2

an adult beaver with her young is shown beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity			1
they are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild			2
the animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft , weigh up to 70lbs , and feed on a diet of reeds , leaves and bark			0
beavers were hunted almost to extinction in @entity247 , both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties			2
the beavers ’ presence in @entity4 remains a mystery			1
there are several captive breeding programmes in the @entity258 , including thirty miles away in western @entity4 , on the other side of @entity260			1
but none of the animals is unaccounted for			0
other explanations touted by locals include their escape from a private collection , or a deliberate release by wildlife fanatics			0
there is a slim chance they travelled from @entity272 , where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers , or even from @entity247 , where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes			0
the @entity143 revealed in november that three generations are living on the @entity32 and campaigned to save them ( shown ) conservationists welcomed today ’s decision , but not everyone will be happy			1
farmers and anglers have raised concerns that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes , and said conservation efforts should be focused on the @entity258 ’s existing wildlife			0
@entity289 , which owns part of the land where the beavers are living , welcomed the decision but warned of the need to manage problems and compensate people whose livelihoods are damaged			2
@entity298 , nature conservation manager for @entity289 , said : ‘ if their numbers increase , then it is inevitable that they will eventually start to engineer their local environment			0
‘ this will bring all kinds of benefits such as a potential slowing down of flood waters and an increase in the diversity of wildlife habitats , but will also likely cause some grief			0
‘ we very happy to work with other parties such as @entity8 and the @entity25 to ensure this trial is a success			2
’ @entity317 , chief executive of @entity25 , said : ‘ this is an historic moment			0
the beavers of the @entity32 are the first breeding population in the @entity183 countryside for hundreds of years			1
‘ we believe they can play a positive role in the landscapes of the 21st century through their ability to restore our rivers to their former glories			0
‘ we know from our own research and research done in @entity247 that beavers are excellent aquatic - engineers improving the flood and drought resilience of our countryside and increasing the water quality of our rivers			2
’ @entity339 campaigner @entity338 , said : ‘ if , as seems likely , they can now remain in the wild , it will be a major victory for common sense and everyone who has campaigned on their behalf			0
‘ beavers add to @entity258 ’s rich natural heritage and can bring huge benefits to the local environment , such as boosting wildlife and reducing flooding risks			0

beavers have been living and breeding on the @entity32 , in @entity4 for five years and went completely unnoticed until a year ago
they are the first wild beavers to breed in @entity8 for 800 years
ministers called for the rodents to be rounded up and put in a zoo
but now @entity8 has they will stay wild - with careful monitoring
creatures will be tested for the @entity166 parasite
