but now an application to sell alcohol at the naturist spa has left @entity8 councillors and neighbours worried that a licence will attract ' trouble makers '			1
the @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , has submitted a request to @entity17 to serve alcohol			1
spotlight : an artist 's impression of the @entity13 , which opened in 2011 , and wants to serve alcohol unusual : @entity23 opened @entity12 in a 1920s former private residence after struggling to find decent naturist spots in the @entity26 but while the owner says that he only wants to be able to serve guests a glass of wine with their dinner , there has been objections about the application			1
councillor @entity35 fears that an alcohol licence would turn the spa into a strip club and that it would attract ' local youths and trouble makers '			1
he is especially concerned because the hotel is next to a children 's nursery , surrounded by family homes and a soon - to - be finished retirement village			0

' there will be a rise in inappropriate behaviour and displays of flesh			0
controversial : councillor @entity35 fears that an alcohol licence would attract ' local youths and trouble makers ' one councillor said granting the application would result in ' a rise in inappropriate behaviour and displays of flesh ' ' we have already had complaints over recent years , passed on to the council about people being nude in the garden and being visible from neighbouring properties and the nursery			1
' having clients who have had a few drinks will only worsen this situation			0
' councillors @entity74 and @entity75 are also opposed to the application			0
and a resident , who has not been named , has written to the council about their objections stating : ' we believe that naturism ( predominately male ) , alcohol and children should not be in close proximity			1
' the note also points out that @entity87 's website states : ' we do not hold a licence to sell alcohol because we wish to promote the healthy aspects of @entity12			1
' but @entity23 , owner of the spa , said the objections are unfounded and that guests will only want to enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner			1
mr @entity23 said original planning permission was granted without any objections from neighbours there are concerns because the hotel is next to a children 's nursery , surrounded by family homes and a soon - to - be finished retirement village ' i do not get where the objectors are coming from , ' he said			2
' we are talking a glass of wine with dinner or a drink relaxing in the garden			0
' it is a spa , a respectful , quality establishment for naturists , not a pub , you ca n't just come in off the street			2
' this is something extra for the benefit of customers , not a big part of the business			0
' he added : ' the police have visited and have been supportive , there is no objection from them			0
i have invited our local councillors to come and look around , but they have declined			2
that invitation is still there			0
