by @entity0 from the disappearances of aviator @entity3 to labor union leader @entity4 , there 's just something about a good mystery that @entity7 find too tantalizing to resist			1
perhaps that 's why the saga of missing @entity10 has continued to rivet the country long after people elsewhere have moved on			2
from the beginning , the story has bubbled with enough drama to rival a good @entity17 whodunit			0
and even though it unfolded on the other side of the world with only three @entity7 on board , many were sucked in anyway			2
' this story has many ingredients of compelling drama , particularly early on : lives at stake , mystery unsolved , a race against time , human emotion , ' @entity27 , executive director of the @entity28 , said in an email			2
the search continues : flight officer @entity33 on board a @entity36 @entity35 , searches for the missing @entity10 in southern @entity38 , @entity39 mysterious : from the disappearances of aviator @entity3 to labor union leader @entity4 , there 's just something about a good mystery that @entity7 find too tantalizing to resist but why did interest remain so high in the @entity7 when the story lost steam elsewhere ? it dropped from most @entity39 front pages and websites weeks ago , despite the search being coordinated off its western coast			1
@entity52 , @entity52 's overseas network , tapered its coverage when other big news broke , such as the crisis in @entity57 and the @entity59 trial in @entity60			1
but @entity52 in the @entity7 continued its heavy focus on the plane			1
even in @entity64 , where two - thirds of the passengers were from , reports never ran nonstop on tv and the clamor on social media also died down			0
march 8 : @entity10 loses contact with air traffic controllers between ne and two hours after takeoff march 9 : radar indicates flight may have turned back from its scheduled route to @entity77 march 11 : @entity79 names two @entity81 men who got on jet with stolen passports march 12 : search expands to area from @entity64 to @entity86 march 15 : @entity88 authorities say they believe ' deliberate action ' caused the plane to veer off course and someone shut down its tracking systems			1
march 20 : search teams spot possible wreckage in @entity38 , 1,500 miles off western coast of @entity39 march 24 : @entity88 prime minister @entity96 says it is ' beyond any doubt ' that the 239 passengers and crew perished in the @entity38			2
march 30 : daughter of pilot @entity102 says her father recently acted strangely april 7 : @entity39 ship @entity104 detects underwater signals consistent with black boxes april 9 : @entity108 detects two more signals april 11 : @entity39 authorities pinpoint location april 14 : @entity113 submarine began its underwater search for missing flight @entity10 april 16 : ' no significant detections ' found , according to @entity39 officials april 19 : the search area for the missing @entity10 plane is narrowed april 21 : @entity113 submarine embarks on its ninth search mission but @entity7 yearned for more			1
many found it impossible to believe that a modern @entity123 carrying 239 people could just vanish without a trace in an age where an @entity127 can be tracked just about anywhere			0
part of the obsession may also revolve around the country 's got ta - know - now mentality and its social media addiction that gets fed 24/7 by the latest breaking news , raw footage or photos going viral on @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			2
since the plane disappeared , it has consistently been one of the top five most - read stories on the @entity0 ' mobile app. and so @entity7 tuned in to watch the latest developments			1
and when there were no new developments , they stayed glued to their smartphones because the suspense of not knowing — or possibly missing something new — somehow spiked when nothing was going on			0
from oil slicks to pings from dying black boxes , each new lead provided a salacious morsel that drove viewers to wonder : will this be it ? ' i find myself drawn into watching or reading about it because it has taken on seemingly mythic worldwide importance , ' @entity158 , an attorney from @entity159 , @entity160 , wrote in an email			2
' in this modern world we simply refuse to accept that something so concrete can get so out of our physical reach and understanding			0
... people just refuse to concede that the cause of the disaster will likely forever remain unknown			0
' after six weeks of breathless reporting , not one shred of hard evidence has been found from the jetliner			0
an unmanned underwater submarine is now using sonar to comb the ocean floor at a depth exceeding 4.5 kilometers ( 2.8 miles ) off the west coast of @entity39			0
it is desperately trying to spot something — anything — that resembles wreckage in an area where signals believed to be coming from the plane 's dying black boxes were heard			1
conspiracy theories : perhaps that 's why the saga of missing @entity10 has continued to rivet @entity7 long after people elsewhere have moved on all hands on deck : crew on board survey ship @entity198 in the southern @entity38 helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing @entity10 a mid-air explosion : the lack of debris could be explained by it falling into @entity88 jungle a terrorist attack : director of @entity209 has said terrorism could not be ruled out power failure : possibly caused by deliberate cutting of power to communication instruments electronic warfare : 20 passengers on board were experts in this technology			1
hijacking : radar data indicates the plane might have made a u-turn			1
a pilot error : there is a chance of them in all air mysteries , claim experts structural failure : possibly involving damage sustained by an accident in 2012 pilot suicide : there were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s caused by this @entity237 black hole : plane is stranded hundreds of miles from current search area according to the latest survey by the @entity243 conducted april 3 - 6 , the missing plane remained the top news story in the @entity7 , with 33 percent of people saying they followed it over a deadly shooting at @entity250 base , developments related to @entity57 and president @entity253 's health care overhaul			1
that 's down from 39 percent in the previous march questionnaire , when nearly half of those asked said they thought the hunt for @entity10 was being given the right amount of coverage			0
@entity52 covered the drama heavily for weeks , once breaking into one of its programs to report that objects recovered from the sea could be trash — which is exactly what they proved to be			1
they featured tons of go - to footage from a flight simulator and a nonstop spool of speculation from talking heads			0
everyone had a theory , with some sounding more like a @entity280 rerun than a newscast : could a black hole or even something supernatural be behind the aircraft 's march 8 disappearance ? @entity52 declined to comment for this story despite repeated requests			1
headline news : interest in the plane 's disappearance has waned in other countries , but there appears to be an insatiable appetite for the story in the @entity7 non-stop coverage : @entity52 was n't the only media outlet covering @entity10 , just the most tenacious one last week , @entity299 columnist @entity298 , begged @entity52 to scale it back			1
' enough , already , ' he wrote			0
' give us a break from the missing plane			0
... put your hands up and step away from the story			0
' even though its coverage was mocked by ' @entity309 " and spoofed by ' @entity310 , ' ' @entity7 kept watching , and the 24 - hour news network 's ratings kept soaring			1
@entity52 reported itself that its all - important 25 - to 54 - year - old viewer demographic more than doubled after its plane reporting began			2
a month and a half into the massive search that has involved scores of countries scouring thousands upon thousands of ocean miles , the plane was still among the top three stories sunday on @entity320			0
@entity52 winner : when big , international news breaks , viewers still flock to @entity52 , and @entity10 is a reminder of that ratings winnger : the network doubled its viewership in the key 25 - 54 demographic during march , since the aircraft vanished the only new development was that the robotic submarine was expected to finish its sweep of the seabed in a week			1
a combination of popular tv shows and a history peppered with real - life detective dramas , from who shot president @entity340 to the identity of @entity343 source ' @entity344 , ' may have been factors that tempted @entity7 to latch onto it			2
' it 's almost like all the seasons of ' lost ' was the promotional period for this story , ' said @entity351 , a pop culture expert at @entity352			0
' we have always kind of put a lot of our popular national narrative into these mysteries and conspiracies and all of the rest of it , ' he added			0
' and this is a pretty powerful one			0
