by @entity0 last updated at 5:00 pm on 11th february 2012 this is the heartbreaking picture of the mother who tried for a staggering 17 years to have a baby - and was a mum for just 32 days			1
@entity5 and her husband @entity6 , 42 , had never given up trying despite nearly two decades of trying desperately to be parents			1
after seven years of trying naturally they underwent two courses of fertility treatment to try and help them , but the second course made mrs @entity5 so ill that she ended up in hospital			1
tragedy : @entity5 with baby @entity14 who developed a rare condition of the bowel and died suddenly in his mother 's arms after 32 days they spent the best part of a decade trying naturally again and finally fell pregnant with baby @entity14 , thinking that their 17 year battle was finally over			1
but tragically at just 32 days old @entity14 developed a rare condition of the bowel and died suddenly in his mother ’s arms			1
mrs @entity5 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , said : ‘ we had waited 17 years to have @entity14 , and every moment we had was so precious with him			1
‘ he had been born early but he had been doing so well and we had expected to take him home with us			1
but we ended up bringing him home in a coffin			1
’ @entity5 and her husband @entity6 on their wedding day			1
the couple tried for 17 years to conceive the couple started trying for a baby soon after they met in the autumn of 1993			1
mrs @entity5 had been diagnosed with polycystic ovaries at the age of 15 and doctors told her it would be almost impossible for me to have children			2
she said : ‘ i was devastated , but i held on to a sliver of hope that one day i would be a mum			2
we knew there was a small chance i may fall pregnant naturally , but only a very tiny one			2
‘ by the year 2000 mrs @entity5 still had n’t fallen pregnant			2
so they decided to try @entity52 treatment to see if that would help			2
but that course failed , and they decided to try another time			2
but this time she became so ill from hyperstimulation of the ovaries that she ended up in hospital			2
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ we decided that enough was enough and we were n’t going to risk my life by trying any more fertility drugs			2
‘ we decided to keep hoping that i would fall pregnant naturally , but we tried to tell ourselves to face up to the fact : that we would never be parents			2
then in 2006 mrs @entity5 was at work as a nurse when she began to feel ill and tired			0
one of the doctors at work did some blood tests and they told her the most unbelievable news			0
she said : ‘ i did several tests just to make sure as i did n’t believe it			0
i was actually pregnant after all these years of hoping , and @entity6 could n’t believe it either			0
‘ i went for an early scan at eight weeks and saw the baby ’s heartbeat and we were just so excited			0
then when i was 11 weeks pregnant i suffered a miscarriage			0
‘ it was heartbreakingly , gut - wrenchingly awful			0
i thought that this was it			0
i was never going to have a baby			0
i thought it had been the one in a million chance for me to be a mum and i had lost it			0
’ amazingly , five years later , mrs @entity5 fell pregnant again in february last year			0
at her 20 week scan doctors told her she was expecting a baby boy			0
memory : @entity5 and @entity6 are now fundraising for @entity88 in @entity26 in memory of their son whose grave is pictured then just four weeks later she was diagnosed with kidney failure and her son @entity14 was born at just 27 weeks , weighing a tiny @entity95			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ i lay in intensive care afterwards and they brought me pictures of him			0
doctors told us that he had such a good chance			0
’ @entity14 had to have an operation to close a valve in his heart at a couple of days old and after a few weeks the doctors told the couple that they would be able to take him home in a couple of months			1
but then suddenly at 32 days old , @entity14 fell ill and doctors diagnosed him with a rare condition that meant his bowel had died and it was quickly poisoning his body			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ it all happened so quickly			0
he fought so hard for six hours , but then i held him in my arms as he slipped away			1
‘ after 17 years of waiting for our son we had lost him after such a short time			0
but even though i was a mum for only 32 days , @entity14 will never be forgotten and every moment with him was so precious			1
’ the couple are now fundraising for @entity88 in @entity14 ’s memory			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ the hospital was wonderful and now we want to help others in the future			0
and we are doing it in memory of @entity14			1
he brought us such joy - even though it was only for 32 days			0

@entity14 developed rare bowel condition and died in his mother 's arms
