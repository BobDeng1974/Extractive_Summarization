how bad does a tackle have to be to earn a red card in the @entity2 these days ? watching the closing stages of @entity6 ’s win at @entity7 , i was disappointed but not surprised to see @entity8 escape with just a booking from @entity10 after wiping out @entity11 with a tackle that could have hurt the striker			1
select group officials are refereeing with so much leniency we can not be surprised when dangerous tackles are not punished strongly			2
@entity8 's ugly lunge on @entity11 could , and should , have earned him a red card on monday both @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) should have been dismissed for high and dangerous tackles a different type of foul also escaped censure at @entity26 ’s on monday night when @entity27 fouled @entity28 with his feet and followed through with his arm			1
dangerous play but not even a yellow card was given			2
friend is not alone - there were at least four other red - card challenges at the weekend where the guilty players stayed on the pitch			0
@entity39 had a double let - off from @entity41 , who failed to dismiss @entity21 for what can only be described as a flying karate kick on @entity45 ’s @entity44			0
there can be no excuse in this case – it should have been a straight red			0
@entity21 ’s team - mate @entity20 later challenged @entity51 with his boot at head height and despite appearing to catch his fellow midfielder , he escaped with a yellow card			2
if there was any contact then he too should have been dismissed for serious foul play			0
@entity41 and his fellow officials are doing their best to keep 22 players on the pitch this season @entity28 complains about a @entity27 tackle , where the @entity63 followed through with his arm down at @entity67 , @entity66 was given a short reprieve when @entity69 pulled out the yellow card after the striker dived in on @entity73 ’s @entity72			1
it was a poor challenge with studs leading and landing on @entity72 ’s ankle			0
@entity66 did get a second yellow shortly after but he should n’t have been on the pitch following that tackle on @entity72			1
in sunday ’s game between @entity80 and @entity81 , @entity83 ’s challenge on @entity84 ticked all the boxes for a red card as it was made at pace with a scissors - type action and he showed no regard for his opponent ’s safety			2
@entity84 went off on a stretcher but @entity83 stayed on			0
@entity66 's tackle on @entity72 was studs up and caught the @entity73 defender on the ankle referee @entity69 only produced a yellow card for @entity66 , despite his dangerous tackle on @entity72 @entity66 was eventually dismissed for two yellow cards , but should have been off for his first challenge it is clear that referees are trying to officiate in a low - key way this season and are letting a lot more go , which fans enjoy			1
no - one pays money to watch a ref and it ’s always disappointing to see a player sent off early in a game that you have spent a lot of money going to			0
however , these tackles are dangerous and if referees continue to only dish out yellow cards they will become more prevalent and players will be hurt			1
the referees ’ top priority in a game is the players ’ safety and too many are not keeping this in the forefront of their minds			1
@entity83 showed no regards for @entity84 's safety with his hard and dangerous lunge @entity84 played no further part after being stretchered off , but @entity83 escaped a red card			0

four @entity2 players were booked for *terrible* tackles this week
@entity66 eventually sent off for second yellow
referees want to let the game flow , but these tackles will cause injuries
@entity27 escaped punishment for a bad challenge
