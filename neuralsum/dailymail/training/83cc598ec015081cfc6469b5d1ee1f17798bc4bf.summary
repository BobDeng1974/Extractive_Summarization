by @entity0 , political editor published : 19:17 est , 1 july 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 2 july 2012 vote : @entity1 , pictured with wife @entity2 at the @entity4 music festival at the weekend , could hold a referendum on @entity7 's future in the @entity8 - @entity1 could hold a referendum on @entity7 ’s future in the @entity8 on the same day as the next general election in 2015 under an explosive plan being hatched by senior conservatives			1
the prime minister yesterday opened the door to giving people their first say on @entity7 ’s membership of @entity19 since 1975 , although he insisted now was not the time for such a vote			1
mr @entity1 said he agreed with the ‘ vast majority of the @entity7 people ’ who were not happy with the @entity7 ’s relationship with the @entity8			2
critics said his ‘ definitely , maybe ’ stance on a referendum was too vague to convince voters and appeared chiefly designed to appease conservative mps , who have been agitating for a referendum			0
but mr @entity1 said ‘ tactical and strategic patience ’ was required , insisting an immediate ‘ in / out ’ vote while @entity19 was in a state of flux and uncertainty was not what most people wanted			1
he intends to spell out this autumn a swathe of areas where he wants powers returned from @entity41 to @entity42 , including home affairs , employment law and social issues			0
some senior @entity46 suggest he could later announce a referendum in which voters would be asked to endorse a looser relationship with the @entity8 to coincide with the next general election			1
although the @entity52 would be likely to walk out of the @entity53 , they suggest mr @entity1 could run a minority conservative government for the last few months of the @entity55			0
such a dramatic move could energise @entity58 support on election day , helping to deliver the party a @entity62 majority , in the same way as last year ’s av referendum , which was held on the same day as local elections			1
alternatively , the prime minister could include a pledge to hold a referendum in the next @entity58 election manifesto			2
but his admission that it is not yet clear when such a referendum might be held , or precisely what it should decide , drew scorn from @entity74 and some in his own party			2
the prime minister has received a letter signed by 100 conservative mps , who say the government must legislate before 2015 to convince voters that it is serious about holding a referendum after the election			1
@entity85 sources insisted his remarks were necessarily open - ended , since it is not clear what sort of @entity8 will emerge from the debt crisis engulfing the @entity90			0
breaking up is hard to do : the referendum would be the first time to question of @entity19 has been put to the public since 1975 , when voters backed the @entity7 's continuing membership of the bloc in a sunday newspaper article , mr @entity1 acknowledged the need to ensure the @entity7 ’s position within an evolving @entity8 has ‘ the full - hearted support of the @entity7 people ’			1
he said : ‘ there is more to come – further moves , probably further treaties – where we can take forward our interests , safeguard the single market and stay out of a federal @entity19			1
‘ as we get closer to the end point we will need to consider how best to get the full - hearted support of the @entity7 people , whether it is in a general election or a referendum			1
for me the two words “ @entity19 ” and “ referendum ” can go together , particularly if we really are proposing a change in how our country is governed , but let us get the people a real choice first			1
’ the prime minister said there were significant areas where @entity8 powers over @entity7 should be handed back			0
‘ put simply , for those of us outside the eurozone , far from being too little @entity19 , there is too much of it , ’ he said			2
‘ too much cost , too much bureaucracy , too much meddling in issues that belong to nation states or civil society or , indeed , individuals			0
‘ @entity135 swathes of legislation covering social issues , working time and home affairs should , in my view , be scrapped			0
’ foreign secretary @entity140 said there would be a ‘ very , very powerful ’ case for a referendum if @entity19 moved towards a more federal system , as expected in response to the eurozone crisis			1
' very , very powerful ' : @entity140 said that , if @entity19 moved to a more federal system , there would be a strong case for holding a referendum but he said on the @entity152 ’s @entity151 that the government wanted to see whether it could negotiate a better relationship between the @entity7 and @entity41 , with the return of powers , before putting the matter to the @entity7 people			1
but @entity58 mp @entity159 , a longstanding critic of mr @entity1 over @entity19 , said : ‘ once again , when it comes to @entity19 , it is always “ jam tomorrow ”			2
the pm should get an @entity165 sailing gold for tacking			0
’ @entity166 , another @entity58 backbencher , said : ‘ this does not go far enough , it falls short of what is required			0
‘ we have had too many vague commitments and promises in the past			0
there is a huge credibility gap – the public do n’t trust politicians any more – and that is why we need a legally - binding commitment to hold a vote after the next election			0
’ @entity52 sources made clear the party would not countenance a referendum while it was in power with the @entity58 – even though it was the only party to suggest an ‘ in / out ’ vote in its last election manifesto			2
business secretary @entity188 said talk of an @entity8 referendum was ‘ horribly irrelevant ’ with the continent in the grip of economic crisis .			0

@entity163 opens door to giving people their first say on @entity19 since 1975
ballot could be held on the same day as the next general election in 2015
@entity140 says move to a more federal @entity19 to solve single *currency* *turmoil* would make a ' very , very powerful ' case for a referendum
