by @entity0 for @entity1 ever had so much chest hair you did n't know what to do with it ? here 's the answer - courtesy of a star stylist who is sculpting world monuments on his clients ' torsos			1
@entity10 has turned his talents from cutting the @entity13 's hair to trimming @entity14 , @entity16 harbour and the @entity17 into men 's upper body shag			1
but he insisted his efforts were considerably more complicated			0
each challenge took two and a half hours , required four types of shaving tools and up to 176 individual ' incisions '			0
he also forged the @entity59 , which he said was one of his most difficult ' manscaping ' achievements to date			0
the challenge left the hair at five different lengths - 0mm , 1mm , 2mm , 5mm and 15mm - but it was a tough task because the hair was so short and curly compared to that found on the men 's heads			2
furry talented : the designs include @entity16 harbour with its world - famous opera house - and there 's even a ' reflection ' which has remained to signify the water in action : stylist @entity10 , 32 , has worked with the @entity13 football team , boy bands on @entity80 , former @entity82 singer @entity81 and footballer @entity83 mr @entity10 said : ' it was a challenge due to how the hair is formed and how it reacts to even the most precise shavers '			1
whether the trend will spread remains to be seen ' creating such intricate designs on men 's chests was a challenge , due to how the hair is formed and how it reacts to even the most precise shavers , ' he said			1
' i set out to achieve something that made people consider the possibilities of grooming and style and challenged my abilities in order to keep up with the high standards expected from my clients '			0
mr @entity10 , whose ' art ' was commissioned by the shaving products firm @entity105 , has styled footballers including @entity107 and @entity108 and has appeared in fashion and men 's magazines			1
he has also done work for the famously mohawked footballer @entity83 alongside @entity82 singer @entity81 and boy bands on @entity80			1
his stunt came after men shaving their chest hair to form the shape of a woman 's bikini top became the latest bonkers trend to hit social media			2
unsettling : the idea sprang from the odd # @entity126 movement on @entity127 , which sees men using razors to create exactly what the name suggests quite the look : some # chesthairbikini showcasers appeared , unsurprisingly , to be at bachelor parties and festivals , while others pose solo or take bathroom selfies oops : other participants , however , appeared to be unaware that they were taking part in a social media craze			0
the odd trend has been around since at least 2012 the origins of the # chesthairbikini @entity127 movement are unknown - with some snaps of the bizarre strain of manscaping as long ago as 2012 - but it received widespread coverage last night			0
some # chesthairbikini showcasers appeared , unsurprisingly , to be at bachelor parties and festivals , while others pose solo or take bathroom selfies			0
a poll by a shaving products firm last year claimed more than 70 per cent of men admitted to trimming their body hair , with almost a third taking more than 20 minutes to get the job done .			2
