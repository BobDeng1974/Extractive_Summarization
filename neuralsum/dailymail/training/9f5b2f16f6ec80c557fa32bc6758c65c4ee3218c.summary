it 's not going to happen ... promise ! the @entity2 has issued a new policy to head of fears that autonomous robots will be designed to kill humans the @entity9 military has made clear that any future robot weapons systems will always need manual authorisation before opening fire on human targets			1
the @entity2 issued a new policy directive saying that any semi-autonomous weapons systems will be designed so they need human authorisation to open fire			1
the promise comes after a @entity20 report called for an international ban on ' killer robots ' , which the group warned could be deployed within 20 years			1
soon after that report was published , deputy defense secretary @entity24 signed a series of instructions ' to minimise failures that could lead to unintended engagements or to loss of control ' of armed robots			2
policy directive 3000.09 says : ' semi-autonomous weapon systems that are onboard or integrated with unmanned platforms must be designed such that , in the event of degraded or lost communications , the system does not autonomously select and engage individual targets or specific target groups that have not been previously selected by an authorised human operator			1
' in order to make sure this is the case , the @entity2 asks that the hardware and software controlling robot weapons comes equipped with ' safeties , anti-tamper mechanisms , and information assurance '			2
they must also be designed to have proper ' human - machine interfaces and controls '			2
above all , they must ' allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgement over the use of force '			0
the @entity2 's promise comes after a joint @entity20 and @entity61 report raised the alarm over the ethics of allowing robots to take decisions as to when to open fire on humans			1
although no @entity9 drone is yet able to pull the trigger without a human operator 's direction , the report warned that militaries worldwide are ' very excited ' about machines that could one day be deployed alone in battle			1
death from above : a @entity9 @entity78 mq - 9 reaper drone takes off from @entity79 , @entity80 automatic firing : @entity84 's @entity83 gun system , which searches for enemy missiles and automatically destroys incoming projectiles there are already precedents for such machines			0
@entity84 's @entity83 gun system , already deployed on @entity92 ships , can search for enemy fire and destroy incoming projectiles by itself			2
the @entity94 is a plane - sized drone able to take off and land on aircraft carriers , carry out air combat without a pilot and even refuel in the air			0
and in @entity102 , @entity101 have developed an automated machine gun sentry robot that is able to spot unusual activity , challenge intruders and , when authorised by a human , aim at targets and open fire			1
faced with such worrying developments , the losing @entity112 report called for ' an international treaty that would absolutely prohibit the development , production , and use of fully autonomous weapons			1
' automatic death : @entity101 's machine gun sentry robot , which is already in use in @entity102 , can spot unusual activity , challenge intruders and , when authorised by a human controller , open fire @entity125 , arms division director at @entity20 , added : ' a number of governments , including the @entity9 , are very excited about moving in this direction , very excited about taking the soldier off the battlefield and putting machines on the battlefield and thereby lowering casualties			1
' a centre for ' terminator studies ' , where leading academics will study the threat that robots pose to humanity , is set to open at @entity140			0
its purpose will be to study the four greatest threats to the human species - artificial intelligence , climate change , nuclear war and rogue biotechnology			0
the @entity148 ( @entity148 ) will be co-launched by @entity149 , the astronomer royal and one of the world 's top cosmologists			0
@entity149 's 2003 book @entity153 had warned that the destructiveness of humanity meant that the species could wipe itself out by 2100			0
the idea that machines might one day take over humanity has featured in many science fiction books and films , including the @entity163 , in which @entity165 stars as a homicidal robot			0
while mr @entity125 admitted such ' killer robots ' do not exist as yet , he warned of precursors and added that the best way to forestall an ethical nightmare is a ' preemptive , comprehensive prohibition on the development or production of these systems			1
' the @entity2 's latest promise could offer some relief for those worried about the possibility of automating warfare , with the new policy mandating a team of senior officials to certify that any weapon meets stringent conditions before agreeing to its development or purchase			2
however , the directive does leave the way completely open for increased autonomy in a range of military robots that are n't intended as killing machines			2
it ' [ d ] oes not apply to autonomous or semi-autonomous cyberspace systems for cyberspace operations ; unarmed , unmanned platforms ; unguided munitions ; munitions manually guided by the operator ( e.g. , laser - or wire - guided munitions ) ; mines ; or unexploded explosive ordnance , ' the policy says			0
that means the @entity2 does not need to apply similar safeguards when developing computer viruses , bugs or surveillance drones			0
as @entity212 puts it : ' while everyone â€™s worried about preventing the @entity211 , the machines are getting a pass to spy on you , under their own power			0

@entity2 policy directive calls for autonomous weapons to be designed so they always need human authorisation to open fire
promise comes after @entity20 report warned that killer robots could be deployed on the battlefield within 20 years
