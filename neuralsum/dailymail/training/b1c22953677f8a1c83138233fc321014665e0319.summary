it is an iconic landmark that attracts millions of visitors every year , but a particularly sticky form of air pollution is turning the gleaming marble domes of the @entity6 brown			1
scientists have found that tiny dust particles and soot from the burning of dung , wood and rubbish nearby are sticking to the surface of the famous building			1
once on the marble surface of the @entity6 , these particles absorb ultraviolet light , giving its normally white domes a dirty brown shade			1
instead workers currently cover the outside of the domes with a layer of clay every few years before peeling it off to restore the white colour of the building			1
archaeologists recently unearthed a long forgotten palace opposite the @entity6			0
the 500 - year - old building is thought to have been the summer place of @entity48 , the fifth @entity49 emperor			0
it would have allowed him to gaze upon the @entity6 , which he had built in memory of this third wife			0
the new palace was found earlier this year and is thought to be a baradari - a pavilion with 12 doors designed to allow free flow of air			0
it was discovered in the garden of @entity61 , which was known to be a favourite spot for the emperor to relax in			0
but now scientists hope their findings will help those caring for the 460 year old mausoleum in @entity67 , @entity68 , to develop new methods for cleaning the building			2
professor @entity71 , an environmental engineer at the @entity72 in @entity73 who led the study , said : ' the particles are super small and stick to the surface very well			1
' they can not be easily removed by wiping the surfaces off or attempting to power wash the surfaces with water			0
also the particles we are talking about do not dissolve in water			0
' there is some concern regarding the long - term impact of the cleanings on the @entity6 domes			2
the only real way to stop the @entity6 from discoloration is to find the sources of the particles and figure out a way to substantially decrease emissions			2
' professor @entity71 first became interested in what was changing the colour of the @entity6 after seeing workers applying ' facial masks ' of clay to the domes of the building			1
built between 1632 and 1653 by the @entity49 emperor @entity48 in memory of his third wife @entity106 , it was constructed from white marble excavated 230 miles away in @entity108 , @entity109 while some of the outlying buildings were built from red sandstone			0
acid rain , sulphurous gas in the air and oxidizing fog have all been blamed for the changing colour of the marble over the years			0
in 1983 the @entity6 was named a @entity119 and the @entity120 has set up a 4,000 square mile zone around the monument where strict restrictions on industrial emissions are in place			1
however , the building has continued to discolour , suggesting something else was the blame			0
the @entity6 was built from thousands of blocks of marble carried to the site on wagons pulled by oxen professor @entity71 started the study after seeing workers using clay to clean the domes at the @entity6 the @entity6 needs to be cleaned very few years due to the build up of brown dust and soot ( right ) on its walls to discover what was causing the discolouration , professor @entity71 , together with scientists from the @entity145 and the @entity146 , placed blocks of marble around the @entity6 site for a year			1
they then analysed the particles that had built up on the surface and compared them to air samples taken from the area around the @entity6			2
they found high concentrations of light absorbing organic carbon , also known as brown carbon , dust and black carbon			1
these were found to be insoluable in water , meaning they can not be easily washed off			0
by measuring the amount of light reflected by these particles , they were able to work out which were responsible for causing the change in colour as seen by the human eye			2
writing in the journal @entity175 , the researchers said : ' a large fraction of the outer @entity6 surfaces are covered with particles that contain both carbonaceous components and dust			1
' our results indicate that deposited light absorbing dust and carbon from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass are responsible for the surface discolouration of the @entity6			1
' professor @entity71 believes that cutting the amount of organic material and traffic levels around the @entity6 may help efforts to return the @entity6 to its original colour			1
he said : ' the @entity6 can be thought of as the lungs of @entity68 , since the same particles that deposit on the @entity6 are being breathed in by people living in the region			2
' the particles are bad for human health			0
cleaning up the @entity6 will certainly make people more healthy in the region			0
' so there is a great health benefit in cleaning up the air in addition to keeping the @entity6 beautiful			0
' dust and pollution from nearby industry was thought to be causing the @entity6 to change colour but the new research suggests local traffic along with the burning of wood , dung and rubbish is causing the damage the researchers set up air sampling equipment around the @entity6 to monitor the levels of air pollution			1

researchers at the @entity72 in @entity73 hope their findings help to return the @entity119 back to its original colour
sticky dust and carbon particles were found to absorb ultraviolet light , turning the marble a *yellow* and brown shade during the *daytime*
results could lead to new ways of cleaning the @entity6 *'s* famous domes
workers currently apply a ' face mask ' of clay to domes to peel off pollution
