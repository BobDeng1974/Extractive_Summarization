when @entity1 forked out their biggest transfer fee of the season on an unknown @entity5 teenager , you could have expected @entity6 to feel the spotlight burning fiercely on him following his arrival in @entity9			1
the @entity11 under - 21 international insists , however , that he feels under less pressure at his new club than he did at @entity14			1
@entity6 secured a dream £ 3million move to @entity1 from @entity17 last summer after long being tagged with his ‘ @entity20 ’ nickname on these shores amid endless hype about his ability			1
the @entity24 giants have blooded him slowly into their side , giving the 19 - year - old plenty of time to adjust to his new life			1
after playing in several @entity31 ties , he was finally unleashed in a league game against @entity33 in january			2
@entity1 's @entity6 ( centre ) says he feels at home in @entity9 after his move from @entity14 and @entity6 — who starred for @entity38 ’s @entity11 under - 21s during their win in @entity40 this week — admits he is delighted at the way he has settled into his new surroundings , highlighting the way he has been able to learn ‘ behind the scenes ’ as the reason for his successful transition			1
‘ of course there was a bit of pressure on me going to @entity9 , ’ he says			1
‘ but i was excited at the thought of a new beginning			2
‘ there was a lot of focus on me in @entity11 — a lot of talk about me and what i was going to do			1
youngster @entity58 ( right ) is currently back in his home country with @entity11 under 21s ‘ but i wanted to escape that			1
that ’s why i was delighted to sign for @entity1 because it was like starting again			1
that was part of my thinking behind the move			2
to get away from it all and develop as a player behind the scenes			2
‘ people might think the pressure would increase going to a bigger club in a bigger league			1
but for me it was almost the opposite			2
i can relax more at @entity1			1
i was delighted to get out of the limelight that i had at @entity14			1
when i was there , there was so much talk about stuff i did n’t like to read about or hear			2
‘ so going over to @entity9 was the right move for me , in terms of development			2
i knew i would n’t go straight into the first team			2
it took @entity6 a while to settle into his new surroundings , but now he feels at home in @entity85 ‘ i was always going to have to play for the b team first but that was perfect for me to learn			1
there was no pressure on me			1
i could get on with it behind the scenes			0
’ @entity6 admits it was n’t all straightforward and that it took some time to settle into life in @entity85			1
however , he believes he has finally adapted to both the change of football style and lifestyle and loved making his bow for @entity1 , where he was widely praised by coming off the bench and inspiring a 4 - 2 win at home to @entity33 ‘ i ’m in a good place right now , definitely , in my football and in my life , ’ he continues			1
‘ i ’m at a really good point in my career			0
i ’m playing games every week and i ’m enjoying it			0
i feel more settled in @entity85 now than i did six months ago			0
it was a big move and it was always going to take time to adapt			1
@entity6 ( left ) played in an international challenge match for @entity11 under 21s against @entity40 this week ‘ if i ’m honest , it did take longer than i expected it to			1
but now i ’ve been there nine months and i feel totally at home in @entity9			2
‘ that ’s my first year nearly up and it ’s flown by			0
i ’ve settled well and i ’m really happy			0
the main thing to begin with was adapting to the way the @entity24 play because it ’s very different to what i was used to			1
‘ it took a lot of games for the b team before i felt comfortable with @entity24 football and the way they play			1
but i ’ve been rewarded by a couple of substitute appearances for the first team , so everything ’s going well right now			0
@entity6 has long held the nickname ' @entity20 ' but he feels out of the spotlight playing for @entity1 ‘ the night when i made my debut in the league was brilliant			1
it was against good opposition in @entity33 ‘ to get around 25 minutes and see the tempo the game was played at was a great experience			0
i was playing with top players			0
‘ the crowd seemed to take to me			0
a big deal was made when i went over to sign , so the fans were eager to see what i could do			0
i think they were quite happy to finally see me in action			0
hopefully i ’ve not disappointed them			0
’ @entity6 ( second left ) moved to @entity1 for £ 3million from @entity14 ( pictured ) and while not quite completely fluent in @entity24 yet , @entity6 has integrated well with the rest of the @entity1 squad			1
‘ i ’ve picked up a fair bit of the language recently , ’ he adds			0
‘ i can now have conversations and stuff off the pitch			0
i ’m maturing as a person over here			0
living in a different country by myself and not knowing the language has made me grow up			0
i ’ve matured a lot			2
‘ i had to learn loads of things and do it on my own			0
it has made me come out of my shell because i was quite shy before i came			0
@entity6 ( right ) stretches with @entity165 team - mate @entity166 at @entity167 this week ‘ there are a couple of @entity24 phrases that i ’ve heard the boys saying , so i tried to pick them up			1
but i ca n’t seem to get a grip of them and they ’re giving me a hard time about it ! ‘ it ’s not swear words , just slang saying like we ’d say in @entity11 : “ what ’s happening ? ” or “ what ’s up ? ”			2
‘ it ’s just a casual phrase			0
i think i ’m saying it the exact same way as them but they tell me i get it wrong			0
maybe it ’s my @entity5 accent ! ’ @entity6 ( front right ) leads the way as @entity11 under 21s arrive at @entity193 on wednesday the focus for @entity6 now is to get more game time and figure more prominently in manager @entity197 ’s plans			1
‘ between now and the end of the season , my aim has to be to be more involved in the first team , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve had a spell where i was in a lot of squads but now i ’m back in the b team			2
they want to dip me in and out			0
it ’s to make sure i continue to work hard and know what it takes to make the @entity201			0

@entity6 left @entity14 to join @entity1 last summer
the @entity24 club paid £ 3million for the @entity5 youngster
he has taken time to settle but now ' @entity20 ' feels at home
there was a lot of pressure on him at @entity14 but now he feels he can get on with his football away from the spotlight
