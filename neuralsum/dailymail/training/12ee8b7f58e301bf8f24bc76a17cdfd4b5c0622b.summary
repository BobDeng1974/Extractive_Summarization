however , @entity2 is 20 on thursday			2
potential alone is no longer enough			0
his performance against @entity25 could at best be described as lively , but he still lacks the confidence and end product that marked him out as a star of the future last season			0
@entity32 has told the player that he must start making the most of his undoubted promise to be part of @entity3 's first - team plans			1
@entity2 has only made six starts under @entity3 boss @entity20 so far this season @entity32 , pictured shaking hands with @entity59 , wants @entity2 to start fulfilling his potential @entity61 put his side ahead against @entity25 with this first - time finish past @entity64 the @entity65 celebrates his 27th minute opener after netting his ninth @entity22 goal of the season ' he has a lot of talent but you have to perform that talent in the matches and also in the training sessions , ' said the @entity3 boss			1
' i 'm not making the line - up , the players themselves are making the line - up			0
you do n't believe that , i think			0

' i was tired and had cramp in the last 15 minutes , but i knew i had a job to do			0
' @entity5 sources maintain that there are unlikely to be any signings before the window closes despite continued speculation linking @entity3 with a £ 37.5million bid for @entity17 defender @entity129 , who is valued at closer to £ 50m by the @entity131 champions			2
