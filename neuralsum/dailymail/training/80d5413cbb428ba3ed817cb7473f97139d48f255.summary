@entity0 on tuesday pushed back ' until further notice ' the delivery of a controversial warship to @entity4 because of the @entity6 crisis , sparking a measured initial response from @entity8			1
president @entity9 said in a statement that the ' current situation in eastern @entity6 still does not allow for the delivery of the first ' of two @entity14 - class vessels @entity0 has built for @entity4			1
' he therefore decided to delay until further notice ' the decision on whether to grant the export licence needed to deliver the ship to @entity4 , the statement added			2
@entity4 has reportedly warned @entity20 of ' serious ' consequences unless @entity0 delivers the first of the two @entity14 - class helicopter carriers by the end of november			1
' we 'll wait patiently ... so far we are not filing a claim anywhere , ' @entity40 told @entity47 news agency			0
the first of the two assault ships - which can carry 16 helicopters , four landing crafts , 13 tanks , 450 soldiers and a hospital - was supposed to be delivered earlier this month , according to the original deal signed in 2011			0
but amid the @entity6 conflict and the rapid decline in the @entity59 's relations with @entity4 , @entity0 has come under intense pressure from its allies , particularly the @entity62 , and in september postponed the delivery			1
the @entity4 navy frigate @entity64 is seen at the @entity33 @entity32 shipyard site in @entity34 could be liable for hefty fines if it breaches the 1.2 - billion - euro ( $ 1.5 - billion ) contract with @entity4 several dozen sailors could be seen this afternoon training or jogging on the harbour nearby while the vast grey vessel @entity30 remained anchored just offshore a source close to the case said @entity9 's announcement was tied to the deadline for the contract , without revealing further details			1
@entity20 faces a serious dilemma over the @entity81			0
it could be liable for hefty fines if it breaches the 1.2 - billion - euro ( $ 1.5 - billion ) contract			0
but it would also risk the wrath of its allies around the world if it were to deliver the hot - button technology to @entity4 at a time when @entity8 is in the diplomatic deep - freeze over the @entity6 unrest			1
' whatever our future decision , half of the world will have it in for us , ' a top - level @entity0 official who declined to be named said earlier this month			2
given an economy that is barely moving forward , @entity0 is unwilling to have two enormous white elephants on its hands and no cash to show for it			2
tense : soldiers stand guard in front of the entrance of the @entity107 of the @entity109 people in @entity110 aerial footage shows how @entity112 has become a deserted wasteland and a crucial battleground selling the ships to another client is not possible as @entity4 technology has already been installed on board , which @entity8 would not want any other country to have and which in any case is not technically compatible with @entity122 military systems			1
also weighing on the @entity0 decision is its reliability as an arms export partner as it seeks to sell @entity127 jets to countries such as @entity129			0
a well - placed source in the @entity4 defence ministry told the @entity133 agency : ' we have no doubt that we 'll get these helicopter carriers			0
@entity0 has even more interest than we do in delivering them			0
' ' we can do without them but what will @entity0 do with them ? that 's the question , ' added this source , who said the contract allowed for a three - month delay that would push the final deadline back to mid-february			1
however , @entity40 told the @entity149 news agency that if @entity0 ultimately refused to hand over the ship , @entity4 would ' go to court and impose fines '			1
' everything is written in the contract			0
we will act according to the wording of the contract , like all civilised people , ' @entity40 said			0
@entity0 had hoped that a ceasefire agreement signed in september would pave the way for a clear - conscience delivery of the @entity161 but conditions on the ground in eastern @entity6 have since deteriorated , with the @entity59 pointing the finger at @entity4			2
meanwhile , some 400 @entity4 sailors currently being trained in @entity34 in western @entity0 , where the shipyard is located , continue to kick their heels until their fate is decided			2
several dozen sailors could be seen this afternoon training or jogging on the harbour nearby while the vast grey vessel @entity30 remained anchored just offshore , its nose pointing out to sea but , for the moment , going nowhere .			0

@entity4 has delivered measured response to being denied warship
@entity0 faces a huge fine if it does *n't* fulfill @entity8 's contract
@entity4 technology has already been installed on carrier
@entity0 therefore can not seek an *alternate* buyer for the vessel
