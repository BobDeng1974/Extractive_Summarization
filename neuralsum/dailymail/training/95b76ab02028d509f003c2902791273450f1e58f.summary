' i 'm not superstitious , ' @entity0 says of the bittersweet memory			2
' but i think my mom had some part in it			2
' @entity0 , whose real name is @entity0 , describes her mother as her ' soulmate ' and admits she still ca n't speak about her without breaking down in tears			1
' she was very busy , and she did not suffer fools , ' the sitcom star explains			1
' her no - nonsense attitude is the single best thing i got from her			2
we 're hungry , ambitious people			0
it 's a family trait			0
' indeed , @entity0 's eponymous title character in her hit series is , she reveals , loosely based on her mother , who was also an ob - gyn			1
@entity0 admits that her self confidence and outspoken nature were not always so apparent however			2
as a child , she recalls being incredibly shy and quiet , ' worried all the time ' about what other people would think of her			0
all of that changed when she watched her first episode of @entity51 , and became quickly ' obsessed ' with the charismatic tv host , staying up late night after night in order to watch his show			2
size matters : the 32 - year - old is often held up as a role model for ' curvy ' women but admits that she does n't want her weight to be the most important thing in her life ' even then , i knew i wanted to be part of that world , ' she adds			1
' i always thought i was funny before anyone told me i was funny			0
' @entity0 's first big break came just a few years after she graduated from @entity68 , when she was offered an opportunity to write for popular comedy series @entity71			1
she was the only woman working on the team			0
but , while her natural flair for writing and unparalleled comedic timing helped to initially launch what is now an incredibly successful career , her rise to the top of the tv industry has n't been at all easy - and regularly sees @entity0 working an 80 - hour week			1
her rigorous working schedule was , at least initially , a welcome distraction from thinking about the loss of her mother however , and ensured that @entity0 cemented her name as one of the industry 's most successful stars			1
life in the spotlight has brought with it a few hard lessons however ; @entity0 is often held up as a role model for ' curvy ' women and , as a result , her size and weight are often subjected to a fierce amount of public scrutiny			2
screen star : @entity0 writes , directs and acts in her own sitcom , the @entity12 the size 8 star admits that she think it is important for women to talk openly about the issues surrounding body image , but is quick to assert that size and weight should be the most important thing in anyone 's life - least of all hers			1
' i do n't think of myself as overweight , ' she explains			0
' i definitely get hurt when people say mean things about my body			0
but it 's not the most important thing in my life			0
' unsurprisingly , @entity0 's love life has also been a topic of much interest and intrigue ; there has been much speculation recently that the screenwriter had reunited with her ex-boyfriend - and former @entity71 co-writer - @entity127 , but @entity0 insists that the reports are nothing more than rumors and insists that she does n't really have the time to focus on relationships and marriage			1
for now , her focus remains on her career			0
' i 'd love to direct a romantic comedy someday , ' she says			0
' there 's still so much i want to do			0
i keep expanding my dreams			0
