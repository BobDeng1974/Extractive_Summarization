from an @entity1 prince and a @entity3 gigolo to a @entity5 billionaire and a priest at the @entity7 , @entity8 has certainly ' dated ' her fair share of interesting men			1
in fact , the 55 - year - old from @entity12 spent three months going on 75 blind dates in 22 countries - and it was all in a mission to find ' @entity18 '			1
ms @entity8 's jam - packed itinerary led her to dine with some ' extraordinary and interesting ' men , which she then tried to match with a dish unique to their culture			1
' i was trying to get to know as many ( men ) as i could , but sometimes i only had one day in a country and i was meeting with two or three men			1
' ' it was hard work , but exciting too			2
' of her 75 dates , an @entity38 named @entity39 topped ms @entity8 's list			1
' @entity39 was one of the most extraordinary men i 've met			2
he 's a naval architect and he was charm on steroids , ' she said			2
' he was the most interesting man , generous of nature , highly intelligent and very warm			2
' to say i fell head over heels for him is an understatement			0
' @entity8 , who was 47 at the time , travelled to 22 different countries , including the @entity54 to dine with various men but , like several of the men ms @entity8 met on her travels , @entity39 was married			1

but not all were what she expected			0
' there was a fellow in @entity82 who was kind enough to cook dinner for me in his small apartment , ' she said			0
' he was chopping up chicken fillets in the kitchen ... and he suddenly turns to me and says if i had another career i 'd probably be a good serial killer because i like chopping and i 'm very neat			0
' needless to say i was gripping my chair in this seventh floor apartment in god knows where			0
' ms @entity8 , pictured here with one of her @entity96 dates @entity97 , tried to match with a dish unique to their culture to the man she was dining with ms @entity8 said her trip was filled with positive and negative dates , but she had no regrets she also met a gigolo in @entity106			1
' well i 'm 99 percent sure he was a gigolo			0
i was having a drink with a friend and he gestured for us to come over			0
he was asking how many stars our hotel had , obviously trying to work out how much money i had			0
' i did n't fall for it , in case you 're wondering			0
' in @entity119 , a man who took ms @entity8 to lunch thought it would be funny to feed her cheese that had less than desirable side effects			1
' ( the cheese ) was called the musician ... when i asked why and he " you 'll see " , ' she said			2
' i farted for three full days and by the end of it i could sound out the whole @entity129			0
he was just watching me ( eat ) with a little smile on his face ! ' while her favourite date was in @entity1 with a man named @entity39 , some dates left ms @entity8 with a sour taste in her mouth ms @entity8 , who after 75 dates ended up meeting a man named @entity141 when she returned to @entity142 , said she opened up during the experience and learned a few things about herself while her time in @entity1 with @entity39 was the stuff dreams are made of , some dates left ms @entity8 with a sour taste in her mouth			1
' in @entity149 , i was hoping for something interesting			0
my cousin had set me up with her ex-boyfriend @entity152			2
i think he told me i was stupid 37 times			0
i had to sit there while he was tearing me to shreds , ' she said			0
' @entity160 was my very first date overseas in @entity162			2
he was a very weird person			0
he obviously did n't think i left a big enough tip so leant across and took more money out of my wallet			0
but then he sang to me â€¦ he tried to seduce me ! ' but ms @entity8 said she had no regrets during her whirlwind trip			1
ms @entity8 , who was the first @entity169 from @entity170 had met , emailed basically everyone she knew telling them she was writing a book about food and men and needed a ' date ' in various countries she said she opened up during the experience of meeting random men , like @entity97 from @entity96 , and learned a few things about herself along the way ' they were all interesting and worth recording			1
they all added some to the smorgasbord , even though some gave me indigestion , ' she said			2
ms @entity8 , who after 75 dates ended up meeting a man named @entity141 when she returned to @entity142 , said she opened up during the experience and learned a few things about herself			1
' i became less judgemental and became open to different possibilities			0
i went over lacking confidence but i ended up feeling good about myself , ' she said			0
' i 've learned to give people an opportunity to show your true side ... you definitely ca n't judge a book by its cover and you ca n't judge a man by his wallet			0
