passing the driving test on the first attempt is an achievement most people would be proud of			1
but for @entity7 driver @entity5 the feat is even more remarkable as he has no arms and has to use his feet to steer the car			1
the 26 - year - old from @entity12 successfully passed his driving test and gained his full drivers license on sunday using just his legs and feet to control the car			1
he uses his left foot to steer the car , resting it on the steering wheel			2
while his right foot is used to push the pedals , move the gear stick and turn on the ignition			0
and even though he only uses his feet to drive , passengers who have been in the car with mr @entity35 say his driving is absolutely safe			0
he uses his left leg to steer the car , keeping his left foot on the steering wheel at all times passengers who have been in the car with mr @entity35 say his driving is absolutely safe , despite using his feet even though he only uses his feet , mr @entity35 , who was six when he lost both of his arms , passed his driving test on the first attempt mr @entity35 was just six when he lost both of his arms , when he was hit by a strong electrical current after entering an unlocked electrical unit while playing hide and seek			1
but that has n't stopped him wanting to lead a normal life or wanting to learn to drive and he was lucky enough to find an instructor willing to teach him			1
he explained : ' the instructor in the driving school showed no sign of surprise when he saw me			0
like if it was just an ordinary situation			0
the only concession is that he drives a vehicle with an automatic gearbox , but apart from that he steers the car like any other driver ' i asked him if he was afraid of driving with me , he said no. ' i passed both theory and practice in the first attempt			2
' actually , before allowing me to sit on a driver 's seat , the instructor asked the @entity70 if there could be any claims against a disabled student			0
' they said they had none			0
