by @entity0 the @entity1 on saturday christened the first ship of its newest class of destroyers , a more than $ 3 billion , 610 - foot - long warship sporting advanced technology and a stealthy shape designed to minimize its visibility on enemy radar and reduce the size of its crew			1
named after the late adm. @entity12 , the newest destroyer 's massive size and angular profile make it stand apart from other @entity18 warships			1
and like its namesake , a reformer who spearheaded changes that helped shape the @entity1 by offering new opportunities to women and minorities , the @entity12 will shepherd the fleet into a new era , officials said			2
stealth by design : the @entity1 christened the @entity31 on saturday , a $ 7 billion stealth destroyer that hosts an incredible array of capabilities not seen in any other ship in the fleet ready to go to war : streamers fly over @entity39 1000 the first @entity40 following its christening saturday ' this ship is a modern marvel , and it 's going to take smart and creative and hardworking sailors like @entity47 to operate it , ' secretary of the navy @entity42 told the crowd of thousands at @entity50 , where the ship has been under construction since 2009			1
@entity54 and @entity55 , the former admiral 's daughters , each christened the ship by smashing a bottle of @entity60 near its bow , followed by cheers and bursts of red , white and blue streamers			1

@entity47 , who became the youngest chief of naval operations in 1970 , promoted the first female and @entity84 - @entity18 officers to admirals and opened the door for women to become naval aviators and serve on warships			1
' he strove for a @entity1 that was supportive , encouraging and compassionate toward all sailors , especially minorities and women , ' his daughter @entity90 said			2
' a @entity1 that not only fought wars but also fought discrimination in its ranks			2

' proud : sen. @entity106 , @entity107 , left to right , sen. @entity108 , i - @entity101 , rep. @entity102 , @entity103 , and rep. @entity104 , @entity105 , observe the color guard during the christening ceremony among the 15,000 - ton warship 's cutting - edge features are a composite deckhouse with hidden radar and sensors and an angular shape that officials say will allow it to be confused for a small fishing boat on radars			0
it also sports wave - piercing hull designed to reduce the ship 's wake			1
it 's the first @entity18 ship to use electric propulsion and produces enough power to one day support the futuristic electromagnetic rail gun , which will be tested at sea in 2016			0
inside , sailors will have more space to work and live because the @entity12 will only require about half the crew of the current generation of destroyers			0
meanwhile , fewer sailors will need to stand watch because of cameras and video monitors that show what 's going on outside			0
that will allow the @entity1 to ' carry out its crucial mission at a time of budget constraints , ' said @entity101 @entity18 sen. @entity106			1
the @entity12 was originally supposed to be christened in october , but the ceremony was rescheduled because of the federal government shutdown			0
the ship is expected to be delivered to the @entity1 late this year and to enter service in 2016			2
it will be joined by two other destroyers in its class , which are also being built in @entity50 .			0
