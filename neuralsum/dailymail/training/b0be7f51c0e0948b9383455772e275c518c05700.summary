but the fact that someone of his standing is thinking about working his way through the management ranks is a boost at a time when many recently retired stars prefer the glamour of the tv studio to learning how to be a boss by striving away in the lower leagues			2
it reflects @entity0 's love for the game , which he said on friday has not changed since a brief flirtation with boxing when he was aged 14			1
@entity0 , who started his career at @entity64 before moving to @entity37 in 2004 , revealed he was persuaded to stay at @entity66 by the club 's former boss @entity67			1
he said : ' @entity67 was a massive help because when i was about 14 i stopped enjoying playing football			1
i had enjoyed it all my life until then , but i was being told to do different things that i did n't want to do and it was down to @entity67 that i carried on			2
' he sat me down and made me fall back in love with it			2
from that moment on , that 's when i said to myself , " this is what i want to be doing "			1
' at that time i was doing boxing as well as football but that 's when i stopped going to boxing and focused solely on football			1
thankfully it was the right decision			2

i felt at that moment that i just wanted to go and enjoy it			0
i felt that it was too much and i remember going home and telling my dad that i did n't want to go any more			0
' my dad was upset with me over it			0
and then i went in to see @entity67 and he was great for me			0
from then , i stopped going to boxing and concentrated 100 per cent on football			2
from then , that 's when the progression was rapid for me			2
' he just said he had seen players throughout his career and that he had n't seen any player with the talent that i had , so i would be making a mistake			0
he said he would always be there to help me and support me			0
' and he said , ' if you keep working hard , then you will be in the first team quicker than you think '			0
once he said that , i thought , ' he used to be @entity64 manager , so he knows the game '			2

' you have to have a great passion for playing for your country as well			0
when you 've played a lot of games and the criticism is coming at you , there must be a moment when you wonder whether you need all this			0
so you have to have that passion			0
' at the @entity41 the criticism affected him after the @entity159 game but he was still able to get himself back on track			0
' the mental strength and passion to play for your country is important if you 're going to be a major player			0
