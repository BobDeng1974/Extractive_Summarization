by @entity0 published : 08:58 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 20 march 2013 rail bosses are spending Â£ 9,000 on robotic falcons in a bid to stop pigeons from defouling their newly - refurbished train station			1
@entity6 are hoping the plastic peregrines will scare off pigeons and seagulls at @entity11 's @entity10 which has just had a new roof installed which has more than 24,000 panes of glass as part of an ongoing refurbishment			1
they are programmed to rotate their heads , flap their wings and unleash four different calls to strike fear into their prey			1
' a falcon kills by descending on the target bird at great speed			2
this is called a stoop			0
during a stoop the falcon achieves a speed in excess on 100 miles per hour			0
' attacks occur with such speed and surprise that birds go on full alert as soon as a peregrine is spotted			0
' many species , such as gulls have a specific alarm call to alert their fellows who will tend to flock together and fly off			0
' @entity42 has been designed to look , move and sound like a real peregrine falcon in order to cause the same reaction as the real bird			0
our objective is to firstly cause a panic reaction so that the pest birds will fly away			0
' we also want to convey to birds that a peregrine falcon has taken up residence in their territory , so there is no point in returning			0
' on patrol : the robotic peregrines will take residence at @entity11 's @entity10 station @entity42 have installed their hand - built birds all over the world , including the @entity92 in @entity93 , an airport in @entity95 and a salt mine in the @entity97			1
they were brought in to help protect the giant new roof at @entity11 's waverley station installed by contractor @entity100			1
but @entity41 says the peregrines ' presence may have a permanent effect on the pigeon population			1
he said : ' they have been there for 150 years so it may not happen overnight but if the pigeons and seagulls believe a pair of peregrines have moved in on their territory it could force them out			1
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we are advised that falcons are the most likely birds to deter pigeons and we will be interested to see how effective they are			1
' there are a number of reasons why we try to deter pigeons , health and safety reasons primarily			2
if we did n't act to keep numbers in check , the station environment would quickly become very unpleasant and could lead to slips and falls			0
' we already have replica , non moving , deterrent birds in various locations around the station as well as netting and surfaces that deter pigeons from landing and prevent access to known roosting spots			2
' we also have a device in the travel hall that emits a noise at a high frequency known to deter pigeons from lingering			2

plastic peregrines rotate heads , flap wings and emit *screeching* noises
aim is to scare away pigeons and seagulls at @entity11 's @entity10
rail spokesman : ' we will be interested to see how effective they are '
