@entity0 jinked and jumped around @entity1 , his fist shaking in relief			1
he had been rocked by the sheer ferocity of a @entity6 beast called @entity7 but now he was being applauded by a crowd on its feet , a champion restored			1
for a few nervous , late - lunchtime moments it looked as if history might just repeat itself			2
it was @entity7 , tall and strong , who had caused an earthquake around this part of south - west @entity18 two years ago when his powerful serve and bold shots sent @entity0 out in the second round			1
@entity21 had rarely witnessed a bigger shock , a 33 - minute final - set dismantling under the roof by the then world no 100 of the great @entity0			1
jumping for joy : @entity0 roars with delight as he seals a four - set win over @entity7 revenge : @entity0 celebrates avenging his defeat to @entity7 two years ago the @entity1 auditorium can make men shrivel or make them grow like giants , and we wondered for a set and a half on thursday whether the air — the roof was down this time — might inspire @entity7 again			1
now ranked 52nd in the world , @entity7 took the first set and carried the momentum into the second , when he broke @entity0 early and took a 4 - 2 lead			1
the @entity44 was wobbling ( as well as twitching and towelling and tarrying , to @entity7 ’s displeasure , as the @entity6 made clear on court with the odd disapproving stare and afterwards in his claim that @entity0 is given special treatment by officialdom )			1
would @entity7 ’s feat of 2012 play tricks with the minds of the players ? after all , it was the biggest moment in one man ’s career and presaged a long downturn in the fortunes of the other			1
there was the murmur that rustles around the court at such moments of tension			0
but @entity0 ’s forehand , whippy and powerful and trusty , combined with his warrior spirit to fight back to 4 - 4			1
the set went to a tiebreak , which the double @entity21 champion won 8 - 6			1
we did not know it for certain yet but the outcome of the match was swinging @entity0 ’s way here and now			2
his uncle and coach , @entity80 , grasped some of the significance of it , though , and celebrated animatedly			0
@entity84 , whose derriere graced a seat in the second row of the @entity88 , contented herself with a more regal clap			0
revenge : @entity0 beat @entity7 to avenge his defeat at @entity21 two years ago not this time : @entity7 was unable to beat @entity0 for the second time in two years @entity7 ’s first serve — an exocet missile — was less reliable in the third set , his confidence dwindling as @entity0 ’s grew			1
the one slight black mark against the match was the speed of @entity0 ’s play , about which @entity7 made a few reasonable points			1
‘ all the players should have the same time between points , ’ he said			2
‘ the best players are taking more than the normal players and nobody is telling them anything			0
i do n’t know why			0
’ most observers thought he was lumping @entity0 and @entity108 together as @entity109 who please themselves			2
@entity7 added : ‘ he was taking a long time between serves			2
he was doing all his rituals			0
i just asked the referee if it was ok and he said it was fine			0
this is not why i lost today , but the referee was not going with the rules			0
’ @entity0 was unconcerned about the issue , happy just to have come through a tough match			2
revenge was not in his vocabulary			0
eyes on the prize : @entity0 battled back from a set down to seal victory test of character : @entity0 did n't have it all his own way against @entity7 , losing the first set looking for inspiration : @entity7 started brightly but faded as the match went on @entity21 : day 4 review @entity135 reached the third round of the @entity137 for the first time			1
the @entity140 no 9 seed , who is famous here for his 70 - 68 fifth - set win over @entity144 in 2010 — the longest match to ever be played at @entity21 — defeated @entity147 ’s @entity146 in straight sets			1
@entity135 did show his love of long sets though , taking the opening set tie - break 19 - 17 , the second longest tie - break in the history of the men ’s competition			1
‘ what happened happened , ’ he said of his defeat in 2012			0
we had already congratulated him for that			0
today ( thursday ) is another story			0
i need to find the solution			0
‘ i had a good answer after being in a bit of trouble			0
‘ i played with fantastic energy in the last three sets			2
very quick with my legs			0
so i am very pleased with the way i played			0
' after winning at @entity173 i feel less pressure this year			0
i am more confident and better physically			0
i am practising with a different energy from the last two years because my knees work better			2
’ next up is @entity177 , the @entity178 ranked 63 in the world and now playing freely after a shoulder injury			2
ahead of that match , @entity0 went back to his house to put his feet up , watch the @entity140 vs @entity185 @entity184 game and get some supper			2
‘ we go to restaurants every single day of the rest of the year so when we are here i like to cook , ’ he said			0
gracious : @entity7 ( left ) congratulates @entity0 on his victory thirsty work : @entity192 ( right ) takes a sip of beer as he and band - mate @entity195 take in some tennis royal touch : @entity84 was spotted in the royal box during @entity0 's game against @entity7 famous face : sir @entity201 and his wife @entity202 were also in the @entity88 on thursday the world number one maintained his momentum to break to love in the first game of set four , soon surging 3 - 1 up			1
after saving a break chance when serving for the match , @entity0 eventually claimed victory at the third time of asking when @entity7 's return was long			1
next for him will be @entity177 of @entity178 in round three after he beat lucky loser @entity212 in straight sets .			1

world no 1 and second seed beats @entity7 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4
@entity7 had chance to go two sets up but could not take it
@entity0 won 14 straight points at end of third set and start of fourth
@entity7 famously beat @entity0 in five sets at @entity21 two years ago
