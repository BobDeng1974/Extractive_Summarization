by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:41 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 31 july 2013 anger : former @entity4 treasurer @entity3 publicly criticised they way he was treated by @entity6 former @entity4 co-treasurer @entity3 today lashed out at @entity6 for the way he was treated following claims he sold access for donors to meet to the prime minister			1
mr @entity3 has won £ 180,000 damages in his @entity14 libel action over a @entity16 allegation about charging £ 250,000 to meet the pm			1
the 59 - year - old businessman brought the claim against @entity20 and two members of the newspaper ’s insight team over three articles which appeared in march 2012			2
but he rebuked his former colleagues at @entity26 who ‘ cut me off within two hours of the story breaking ’ and has had a ‘ dark cloud ’ hanging over him ever since			0
during the legal action mr @entity3 complained the @entity16 suggested that , in return for cash donations to the @entity4 , he corruptly offered for sale the opportunity to influence @entity36 policy and gain unfair advantage through secret meetings with the prime minister and other senior ministers			1
during the litigation , the @entity41 ruled that ‘ corruptly ’ meant ‘ inappropriate , unacceptable and wrong and gave rise to an impression of impropriety ’			0
he also said the @entity16 meant he made the offer even though he knew the money offered for meetings was to come @entity49 investors in a @entity51 fund , in breach of the ban under @entity55 electoral law			2
in addition mr @entity3 said the article meant he was happy that the foreign donors should use deceptive devices to conceal the true source of the donation			1
the newspaper , which also has to make a £ 500,000 costs payment by mid-august , had pleaded justification but failed to prove its claims			0
mr @entity3 also succeeded in his claim for malicious falsehood but no separate damages award was made in respect of that today			1
he said later : ‘ the dark cloud that has hung over me and my family since the @entity16 published its malicious lies about me 16 months ago has finally been lifted and justice has been done			1
‘ my world was turned upside - down when that article was published			1
i remember vividly having to walk into my offices the day after the article was published and face 500 of my staff , many of whom had a clip of the @entity16 interview on their video screens			2
‘ i was also embarrassed to accept invites to events which meant that my charities suffered			0
the @entity4 cut me off within two hours of the story breaking and did not want to hear my side of the story			0
‘ i was constructively dismissed from my role as party treasurer and made to feel like an outcast as the prime minister and the party lined up to criticise me on television and radio			0
this hurt me immensely and further damaged my reputation			0
’ pressure : the @entity16 claims triggered a crisis for @entity6 , who was quick to distance himself from mr @entity3 in march last year mr @entity3 said that since the article was first published he had ‘ kept a dignified silence ’			1
but he added : ‘ perhaps the @entity16 under - estimated me and thought i would quietly disappear but i knew all along that i was telling the truth and that the story was malicious , so i was prepared to fight all the way			2
‘ i hope my victory shows that this type of journalism employed by the @entity16 and its journalists @entity112 and @entity114 is totally unacceptable , particularly post @entity115			2
’ he added : ‘ today is a good day for me			0
i am delighted that my good name has been restored			0
my family , friends and legal team have shown me huge support throughout , which has kept me going , and i sincerely thank them			0
’ former @entity4 treasurer and major donor @entity122 said the party ‘ needs to learn major lessons from this debacle ’			2
writing on the @entity128 website , lord @entity122 said : ‘ mr @entity3 quite rightly alerted the party ’s hierarchy to events and must have hoped for , even expected , its full support			1
' yet , despite contradicting the paper ’s version of events , he was forced to resign within hours and was ostracised by senior party figures ( except predictably @entity137 ) over the next weeks and months			0
he has had no @entity4 invitations since his resignation			0
’ criticism : former @entity4 donor @entity122 called for mr @entity6 to apologise to mr @entity3 lord @entity122 said : ‘ i hope that mr @entity6 will now offer mr @entity3 an apology for his criticism of him , and for forcing him to step down as treasurer with such haste when mr @entity3 was fulfilling his unpaid role well and effectively			1
that would be the right thing to do			0
‘ surely the instincts of our party should always be to stand by one of its own until it has been proved that an individual has acted illegally or improperly even if it may be politically appropriate in certain circumstances to suspend someone pending an outcome			0
’ lord @entity122 urged mr @entity6 to scrap the inquiry , led by @entity159 , which he ordered into @entity4 funding in the wake of the allegations against mr @entity3			1
‘ perhaps , given that the inquiry was an over-the top , knee - jerk reaction to what has now proved to be a false premise , it needs to be quietly wound up sooner rather than later , ’ said lord @entity122			1
‘ this whole episode involving mr @entity3 has not been our party ’s finest hour			1
’ conservative chairman @entity173 repeatedly refused to apologise on behalf of the party for the way mr @entity3 was treated			1
he told reporters : ‘ i think @entity3 did exactly the right thing			2
he has pursued this through the courts and got the outcome that he wanted , the right outcome as well , and good luck to him			0
‘ he has got the right to that and it ’s good that he did			0
’ pressed on whether there was a need for the @entity189 and mr @entity6 to say sorry , mr @entity173 said : ‘ i do n’t really think it ’s a question of that , i think it ’s a question of congratulating @entity3 for managing to pursue this and get the right outcome			1
