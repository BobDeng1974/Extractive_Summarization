by @entity0 all life on @entity2 is said to have come from one common ancestor , a single - celled organism known as life ’s @entity5 ( @entity7 )			1
but what @entity7 looked like , how it lived , and how humans evolved from it is still a four - billion - year - old mystery			2
researchers believe they have now discovered clues that may help tackle this mystery - and it ’s all down to the organism ’s ‘ leaky ’ membrane			1
using mathematical modelling , researchers claim the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) passed energy through a ' leaky ' membrane			1
this caused it to grow and evolve			0
as it moved to new surroundings , membranes evolved independently causing bactera and archaea organisms to evolve separately ( shown in this illustration ) the study , by @entity31 , claims this membrane may explain why all cells use the same complex mechanism to harvest energy			1
it may also explain why two types of fundamental single - celled organisms - bacteria and archaea - have different cell membranes			0
the @entity5 ( @entity7 ) is the name given to a crude organism that is now traceable in all domains of life ; plants , animals , fungi , algae , and so			1
very little is actually known about this ancestor , and some scientists debate whether it was a cell			0
a recent study from the @entity53 suggested @entity5 was a more sophisticated organism than presumed , with a complex structure that makes it identifiable as a cell			2
the research , published in the journal @entity60 , built on several years of study of a previously overlooked feature of microbial cells			0
this particular area has a high concentration of polyphosphate , a type of energy in cells			2
the research argued that this polyphosphate storage site actually represents the first known universal organelle			0
an organelle is a specialised unit in each cell that carries out a specific function ; just as an organ does for the human body			0
the team of researchers , led by dr @entity80 from the university ’s @entity81 , made the discovery using mathematical modelling			1
they claim that the leaky membrane allowed @entity7 to harness the energy from its surroundings , which were most likely vents on the ocean floor			1
the cells were able to allow protons to enter and exit at the same time , causing them to grow at an accelerated rate			1
researchers believe @entity7 lived in an area where ancient seawater , packed with positively charged particles called protons , mixed with warm alkaline vent fluid , which contained fewer protons			2
the difference in the concentration of protons across these two environments enabled protons to flow into the cell			0
this drives the production of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate ( @entity111 ) , which makes modern - day cells grow , for example			2
however , scientists believe this was only possible if the membrane was ‘ leaky ’ as it allows protons to leave and enter the cell spontaneously to power such growth			1
dr @entity80 said : ‘ i find this work just beautiful - it constrains a sequence of steps going from the strange cell that seems to have been the ancestor of all life today , right through to the deep division between modern cells			2
this tree diagram reveals how @entity5 eventually split into bacteria , archaea and eucaryota , or eukaryote			2
@entity134 includes humans and other animals , plants , and fungi ‘ from a single basic idea , the model can explain the fundamental differences between bacteria and archaea			0
is it right ? i ’d like to think so , but more importantly , it makes some clear predictions that we plan to test in the future			0
’ dr @entity80 added : ‘ in these deep sea vents , there is a continuous flow of alkaline fluids , which mix with the ocean waters			0
‘ when they mix , the fluids neutralise each other , and that stops any build - up of charge which would otherwise prevent protons flowing into the cell			0
‘ if the first cells had leaky membranes , then protons could enter and then be neutralised , or leave again , almost as if there was no barrier at all			1
the researchers claim that this evolution process explains why membrane bioenergetics are universal in archaea ( pictured ) and bacteria - yet ion pumps and membranes are different , which has been the big unknown ‘ what we ’ve shown is that the rate at which protons enter and leave is high enough to power the growth of cells via proteins embedded in the membrane			1
‘ @entity7 could have been powered by natural proton gradients in vents , but only if it had a really leaky membrane , completely unlike today ’s cells			1
’ lead author @entity185 , a researcher in @entity31 ’s @entity81 , added : ‘ exploiting gradients is universal across all life , but understanding how @entity7 used one to drive growth gave us a bit of a chicken - and - egg problem : @entity7 would n’t make a gradient if it did n’t know how to exploit it , but how could it learn how to exploit a gradient if it did n’t make one in the first place ? ‘ we propose that natural proton gradients provide a solution because @entity7 did n’t have to make the gradient ; it was already there for free			1
we show that modern ‘ non-leaky ’ membranes had to evolve later , and they did so independently in archaea and bacteria			0
‘ this explains why membrane bioenergetics are universal in archaea and bacteria yet ion pumps and membranes are different , which has been the big unknown			0
’ the findings are published in the journal @entity214 .			0

researchers believe they have discovered clues about life ’s @entity5 ( @entity5 )
using mathematical models , they found it may have had a ‘ leaky ’ membrane
this allowed @entity5 to harness the energy from its surroundings
the cells were able to allow protons to enter and exit at the same time , causing them to grow at an accelerated rate
this would n’t have been possible if the membrane did n’t ‘ leak ’
findings offer clues as to how humans and other life evolved and grew
