now , however , the married woman has been crowned mrs @entity13 at the age of 23			1
dream come true : @entity6 now feels confident in her looks and happy with the person she is no more tears : the plus - size pageant gave ms @entity6 a chance to beat the schoolyard bullies whose words still haunted her starring role : the married woman has been named mrs @entity13 2012 - and never feels fat any more ms @entity6 grew up watching the @entity28 pageant every year and wishing she could be one of the girls on the stage			1
to make matters worse , while she was taunted by school bullies , her petite sisters regularly scooped prizes in regional beauty competitions			1
after years of suffering , she decided she would not let size get in the way of her dreams , and entered mrs @entity39 , a beauty pageant specifically for larger women			1
she missed out on the national title , but was named mrs @entity13 , gaining the confidence to be proud of her curves			2
she said : ' i used to watch the @entity28 pageant as a child and wished i could be one of those girls			0
new outlook : the young woman said she might never have pursued her dream without the encouragement of her husband beaming bride : ms @entity6 shines on her wedding day beside her sisters @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) ' i had decided that i was never going to be skinny enough or pretty enough to do that so year after year i would watch them and continue to wish			1
' at school people commonly called me " fat " and " fatty " - the worst was " garbage disposal " because people thought i ate too much			0
‘ i do n’t remember anything more than that because i ’ve tried to let them go and remove any negative forces in my life			0
' my gorgeous sisters are 10 and 16 years older than me and i remember going to a few local parades and seeing them with beautiful dresses and people waving at them - i wanted to be that girl			2
' miss @entity6 , who works in home automation support for appliances and lighting , was browsing @entity81 one day when she stumbled across a link to an interview with the mrs @entity85 2011 winner			1
acceptance : ms @entity6 , pictured with her fellow competitors , realized there was somewhere she could be herself and feel beautiful all that glitters : the 23 - year - old had watched her slim sisters @entity59 , back , and @entity60 , front , compete in pageants without any hope it would one day be her turn ' my first thought was " wait a minute - plus ? " ' she said			1
' i realised i had a chance to be one of the girls i thought i would never be skinny enough or pretty enough to be			0
' i was obviously anxious but my amazing husband @entity99 encouraged me and kept on telling me it would be all right and he really wanted to see me do this			0
' i spoke to the wonderful organisers and when @entity99 saw my expression each time i spoke with them , he pushed me more			0
i remember feeling accepted for the first time			0
' not too long after i entered , i noticed myself being more confident			2
about two months before the pageant @entity99 walked in on me in the bathroom crying and asked me what was the matter			0
@entity111 beauties : despite not winning the national title , ms @entity6 now feels good in her own skin long journey : ms @entity6 said she cried when she looked in the mirror and liked what she saw for the first time ' i explained that for the first time in my life i could look into the mirror and actually like what i see looking back			1

' i want to send out a positive message about feeling confident with who you are			2
' @entity127 changed my life and helped me see what a woman should be			2
it has turned me from a girl into a woman and given me the strength to accept myself and shine			0
