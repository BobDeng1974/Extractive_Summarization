by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 13:00 est , 3 september 2012 @entity3 's wish to expand airport capacity near @entity5 , even if that means building a third runway at @entity7 , has sparked a furious reaction from fellow @entity9			1
mayor of london @entity10 said it would be a ' disaster ' while @entity12 warned he would stand down at the next election if his party does not block expanding @entity16 's biggest airport			1
mr @entity3 , who is in charge of election policy for the @entity9 , yesterday opened the door for the @entity20 to complete a sensational u-turn on the third runway issue			2
expansion : debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at @entity7 and @entity3 sparked speculation there could be a u-turn on the issue he is also said to be behind unconfirmed rumours that an independent panel of experts will now look at the issue , taking the decision out of @entity36 ' hands			1
@entity37 today also confirmed that a consultation on airports will be launched in the next few weeks , adding that advocates of @entity7 's expansion would be able to make their case			1
' i think the arguments that are put forward in favour of @entity7 expansion are based on wild exaggerations , ' @entity12 told @entity48 's @entity49			1
' @entity7 is already one of the busiest airports in the world			2
' the mp for @entity54 and @entity55 went on : ' i think if we enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out expansion of @entity7 i think the @entity20 will be very badly defeated in areas beneath the flightpath			1
anger : @entity20 @entity12 says he would stand down over the issue as he believes his party must protect those under the @entity7 flight path ' i personally would not want to stand as a conservative candidate on a manifesto that is ambiguous on this issue			1
i think we need to be very very clear and honest with voters			0
' transport secretary @entity71 - whose @entity73 constituency lies under @entity7 flightpaths - has been a vociferous opponent of a third runway and it is thought that her fate in the @entity78 reshuffle this week may rest on the prime minister 's plans for aviation policy			2
prime minister @entity83 's official spokesman said today that the government 's position was unchanged since the coalition agreement of 2010 , which committed ministers to scrapping plans drawn up by the previous @entity90 administration for a third runway at @entity7			1
but he confirmed that a consultation process would be announced within the next few weeks , with all sides being given the opportunity to put their views - including proponents of a third runway			2
controversial : @entity3 said yesterday that the south - east needs to expand its its air capacity , and that could include at @entity7 the spokesman told reporters at a regular @entity104 briefing : ' we said before the summer that we would come back to this issue in the autumn			2
we will do that in due course ... we will say more about the process in the next few weeks			0
' he added : ' the government 's position on the third runway is as set out in the coalition agreement			0
' what the chancellor said was that he believed that there was a case for additional capacity in the @entity121 and we should look at all the options			0
' there are strong views about this issue on both sides of the argument			0
any process must involve listening to those views and , therefore , i would expect all the options to be considered within that process			0
' if we are going to listen to people 's views , there are people who are making the case for the third runway who i am sure will make that case			0
' there 's a coalition programme for government that sets out the position on that , but i think there is going to be a debate about this issue and i would expect the people in favour of that proposal to put forward that proposal			0
the coalition programme commitment remains			0

@entity10 says it would be a ' disaster ' while mp @entity12 vows to stand down over the issue
