teenage girls with anorexia have an above - average number of autistic traits , a new study has found			1
some might even have autism that has n’t been diagnosed			0
researchers at the @entity2 say the two conditions share many features , including narrow interests and rigid or obsessive behaviour			0
and understanding the link could lead to new ways of treating anorexia , which accounts for around 10 per cent of the @entity24 ’s 1.6million cases of eating disorders			1
the researchers put 66 girls aged from 12 to 16 through tests used to identify autistic traits , comparing their results with those of some 1,600 healthy girls of the same age			1
those with anorexia proved to be poorer at empathising – like people with autism , who often have difficulty distinguishing people ’s different emotions – and scored more highly on tests of ‘ systemising ’ , an interest in pastimes with rules and patterns			1
in a broader test , five times more of the anorexic girls got a score within the range typically associated with autism			0
researcher @entity50 , a leading expert on autism , said : ‘ traditionally anorexia has been viewed purely as an eating disorder			1
‘ but this research is suggesting that underlying the surface behaviour , the mind of a person with anorexia may share a lot in common with the mind of a person with autism			0
‘ in both conditions , there is a strong interest in systems			0
anorexia is an eating disorder more commonly seen in girls , while autism , a neurodevelopmental condition , is more commonly diagnosed in boys			1
the new study has managed to link the behaviours in both ‘ in girls with anorexia , they have latched onto a system that concerns body weight , shape and food intake			2
’ writing in the journal @entity84 , the researchers said it might be possible to help anorexics by shifting their focus away from foods to horse - riding , rowing or other pastimes that involve lots of rules and patterns			2
dr @entity95 , who co-led the study , said : ‘ recognising that some patients with anorexia may also need help with social skills and communication and with adapting to change also gives us a new treatment angle			0

anorexics were found to have an above - average number of autistic traits
understanding the link could lead to new treatments for anorexia
condition accounts for around 10 *%* of the @entity24 ’s 1.6million cases of eating disorders .
