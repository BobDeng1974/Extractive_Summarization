a @entity1 gangster accused of two murders in his home country has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds in a deportation farce after claiming he was too depressed to leave @entity6			1
@entity7 repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him , claiming they breached his human rights			1
the 52 - year - old , who is wanted for 22 crimes in @entity1 , spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill , leaving the @entity6 public to foot the bill			0
depression claim : in january last year , @entity7 was admitted to @entity17 on health grounds but by june his condition had improved and he was returned to @entity20 ( above ) yesterday judges at the @entity22 criticised his ‘ manifestly ill - founded ’ case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home			1
in @entity1 he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders , robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997 , when he was a member of the feared @entity32 gang			1
the ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by @entity1 police in june 2010			0
his case has cost @entity6 taxpayers a six - figure sum , according to legal experts			1
this figure includes the cost of police time , legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts , the £ 40,000 a year price of keeping him in the category a prison @entity20 , and treating him at @entity17 high - security psychiatric hospital			2
his case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws			1
@entity59 , a former @entity60 mp , said : ‘ this is a shocking example of @entity63 ’s @entity62 putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the @entity6 public			1
’ waste of time : judge @entity70 ( above ) , of the @entity22 , said : ' the court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill - founded and must be rejected ' @entity7 came to the @entity6 in 1996			1
it is thought he claimed asylum			0
he was arrested in @entity75 in june 2011 under a @entity76			0
magistrates agreed to his extradition in october of that year and he was held in @entity20 prior to being sent home			2
but he appealed to the @entity80 on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned			2
he claimed this violated @entity86 , the right to life , and @entity89 3 , the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment			0
@entity6 judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation			0
but @entity7 then launched a new appeal with the @entity22			2
according to court documents , in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill , with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed , suffering from a delusional disorder , and that there was a risk of suicide			0
in january last year , he was admitted to @entity17 but by june his condition had improved and he was returned to @entity20			0
he appealed to @entity104 under @entity89 and @entity105 , which guarantees the right to a fair trial , because he had not been allowed to argue his ill - health during extradition proceedings			0
but in a written ruling , the @entity112 judges , led by court president @entity70 , said @entity7 ’s claim that extradition breached his human rights was ‘ inadmissible ’			1
they added : ‘ the court considers this complaint is manifestly ill - founded and must be rejected			0
