travelling can be tiring , especially if there are many flights involved and jet lag			0
however for one sleepy explorer , a trip of a lifetime to witness the @entity6 seemed to be all too much - that or he was completely uninterested in the adventurous trips he was booked on			0
@entity12 , aka @entity13 posted the pictures of dozing @entity15 on the social networking site this week with the caption : ‘ went to the @entity18 , cousin slept everywhere			1
the traveller went on a trip of a lifetime to see the @entity18 rainforest ... but he missed the whole thing being asleep ! dozing away ! even a trip piranha fishing could not stir the slumberer from his nap incredible nature moments the traveller missed due to napping include a pink dolphin watching tour and even a nail - biting piranha fishing expedition			1
sadly he even missed seeing adorable sloths and monkeys in the wild , and impressive giant @entity18 lily pads			2
when action was required of him , and he was due to take an intrepid jungle hike , naturally he slept through his alarm and missed the whole thing			0
the pictures were captured by his cousin @entity42 who posted them on @entity44 @entity45 said that her slumbering companion had been the one to push for the trip and that he chose the trip over going to @entity49 since he was set on seeing the jungle			1
the bemused @entity51 said : ‘ he had no real reason to keep falling asleep ; he also slept any time we we were in our room			0
‘ our trip was to @entity57 , @entity58 , for a few days at the end of february , and cost around £ 1,000 ( $ 1,600 ) just for the @entity18 addition			2
’ the sleeper had pushed for the trip , and said he was keen to see the @entity18 rainforest in particular as he had already been to @entity49 , the alternative trip @entity15 is said to be bemused at his new found internet fame , following the pictures going viral on the site			1
@entity45 said : ‘ he ’s surprised anyone else thinks it ’s funny besides us			0
‘ my favourite thing is that his biggest fear is falling out of a moving car while sleeping , yet he was fine napping on a tiny boat in the giant @entity18			0
’ expensive sleep ! the trip cost @entity15 upwards of £ 1,000 ( $ 1,600 ) and he even missed getting up for the jungle trek completely			1

@entity15 *persuaded* his cousin to go to the @entity18 over @entity49
he booked many exciting tours including a jungle trek and piranha fishing
the traveller slept through the entire trip , missing sloths and monkeys
his cousin @entity42 posted the *hilarious* pictures on @entity44
