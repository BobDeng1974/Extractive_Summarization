by @entity1 reporter a bike shop owner has set a new world record after inventing a bicycle that can travel at more than 110mph			1
@entity5 , 42 , spent 10 days building the super-strong mountain bike which cost a total of £ 5,000			1
motorcycle racer @entity8 commissioned mr @entity5 to make the bike which he pedalled into the record books at 112.94mph ( 181km/h ) earlier this year			1
in order to break the record mr @entity8 was towed at 50mph on @entity21 in @entity22 , before being released where he hit just under 113mph ( around 180km/h )			1

all the bike 's materials , except the tyres , were sourced from the @entity34 the vehicle has just one gear which allows the bike go up to 130mph it uses @entity40 laminated tyres the bike is made up of two aluminium wheel frames one tailor - made lightweight steel frame measuring 22inches x 22 inches ( 56cm x 56cm )			2
the entire bike weighs 22lbs ( 10kg ) mr @entity5 , who runs @entity45 in @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' the funny thing is , my dad @entity50 was contacted by the people who set the current world record asking if we could help to build the bike			1
' due to various work commitments we did n't take it on , so when we got a call from the producers in february about another attempt to break the record , we could n't say " no "			0
' i made the bike in the workshop over 10 days and welded the steel frame together and brazed it as well			1
' it was n't a particularly light bike because that 's not what we were focusing on			0
we needed to make sure it was strong and the tyres actually were quite thick as we needed extra tread to grip with			0
resilient : mr @entity8 broke the previous record set by @entity17 cyclist @entity16 , who reached 83.13mph on a pushbike in september this year ' because all the components have been tailor - made , the bike is almost priceless because companies might never agree to make them			1
' but the price to construct the bike came to roughly £ 5,000			0
' ' the fact that we got to work with @entity8 was incredible			2
he is someone i have always found interesting having seen a lot of his programmes			0
' he came along to our workshop in @entity46 with the tv crew so he could get measured up for the bike , and he even helped me to make it			1
' former @entity34 @entity92 winner @entity91 , 38 , was also enlisted to help in the record - breaking bid			2

the record breaking attempt features in a new @entity29 series called ' speed ' which began last night bike designer mr @entity5 said : ' the fact that we got to work with @entity8 ( pictured preparing for record ) was incredible			1
' mr @entity8 was towed along by a truck at 50mph before being set free to up the speed on his own ' i explained i could tick all three boxes so then found myself meeting up with @entity8			2
it sounded fun and i 'm always up for a challenge , so we thought we 'd give it a crack			0
' it was exciting to take part , but i was also aware of the risks involved			0
i was conscious of what could happen if things went wrong with someone cycling so close to the rear of the truck			0
