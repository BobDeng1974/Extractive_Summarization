by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 16 april 2013 in a short briefing from the @entity4 press room , president @entity1 called monday 's bombings near the finish line of the @entity7 ' a heinous and cowardly act , and given what we now know about what took place , the @entity9 is investigating it as an act of terrorism			1
' with flags across the country flying at half - staff , @entity1 leveled his sharpest words yet about the attacks that killed three people and left at least 173 injured , some gravely			1
' any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians , it is an act of terror , he said			2
' ' what we do n't yet know , however , ' he added , ' is who carried out this attack or why , whether it was planned by a terrorist organization , foreign or domestic , or whether it was the act of a malevolent individual			2
' ' we will find whoever harmed our citizens and bring them to justice , ' @entity1 said in closing			1
' we also know this : the @entity39 people will not be terrorized			1
the first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives			2
the men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world , and the medical students who hurried to help , saying " when we heard , we all came in			2
" the priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful			2
and the good people of @entity74 who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by it			1
' ' if you want to know who we are , what @entity39 is , how we respond to evil , ' @entity1 said , ' that ’s it			1
' on monday the president avoided using the words ' terror , ' ' terrorist ' or ' terrorism , ' leaving a @entity4 official to tell reporters after his prepared statement that the federal government was , in fact , treating the carnage in @entity74 as a terrorist act			1
but less than 24 hours later , the word is firmly in the presidential lexicon			1
and @entity39 lawmakers joined - or perhaps led - the chorus			1
the second of two explosions rocked the last 1050 yards of the @entity7 course , sending shrapnel into the crowd , severing limbs , and ending lives ' my understanding is that it 's a terrorist incident , ' @entity114 @entity113 senator @entity112 was quick to say on monday			2
sen. @entity116 , that committee 's vice chairman and ranking @entity118 , said that ' as the evidence mounts that this was a terrorist attack , our intelligence and law enforcement agencies must do whatever is necessary to find and interrogate those responsible so we can prevent similar attacks			2
' one of their counterparts in the @entity128 , @entity130 chairman @entity129 , told reporters that the attacks in @entity74 had ' all the hallmarks of an act of terrorism , but we do not know for sure who did it			1
' @entity140 chairman @entity139 offered his sympathies ' to victims of the terrorist attack in @entity74 as well as to their families			2
' @entity147 senators @entity145 and @entity148 said that initial reports suggests that the bombs ' bear the hallmarks of a terrorist attack			1
' a victim of the first explosion is helped on the sidewalk of @entity157 , after two devices were detonated near the finish line of the 117th @entity7 @entity1 's reticence to refer to attacks on @entity39 soil as ' terrorist ' activities was brought into sharp focus during his 2012 re-election campaign , when @entity118 challenger @entity166 chastised him during a debate for refusing to call the sept. 11 , 2012 attack on the @entity39 @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 an act of terror			1
the president , backed by debate moderator and @entity177 chief political correspondent @entity176 , insisted that he had in fact called the attack a terrorist act in a speech during the day following the @entity170 assault			1
@entity184 correspondent @entity183 , however , had interviewed the president on the day he gave that speech and asked him why he ' went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in connection with the @entity171 attack			1
' @entity1 responded that it was ' too early to know exactly how this came about [ or ] what group was involved			1
' @entity184 kept the interview out of public view until the night before @entity198 , long after the debate confrontation had cemented in many @entity39 ' minds the idea that @entity1 never expressed reluctance to declare that ' terrorists ' attacked @entity39 in @entity170			1
as with he @entity170 situation , the @entity4 has promised a continuing series of briefings throughout the length of the investigation			2
i 've just been briefed by my national security team , including fbi director @entity212 , attorney general holder , @entity214 , and my @entity215 and homeland security advisor @entity216 , on the attacks in @entity74			2
we continue to mobilize and deploy all appropriate law enforcement resources to protect our citizens , and to investigate and to respond to this attack			1
obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims , their families , and the city of @entity74			0
we know that two explosions gravely wounded dozens of @entity39 , and took the lives of others , including a 8 - year - old @entity229 was a heinous and cowardly act			1
and given what we now know about what took place , the @entity9 is investigating it as an act of terrorism			2
any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror			0
what we do n’t yet know , however , is who carried out this attack , or why ; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization , foreign or domestic , or was the act of a malevolent individual			0
that 's what we do n't yet know			0
and clearly , we ’re at the beginning of our investigation			0
it will take time to follow every lead and determine what happened			0
but we will find out			0
we will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to @entity257 also know this -- the @entity39 people refuse to be terrorized			1
because what the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosions were stories of heroism and kindness , and generosity and love : exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood , and those who stayed to tend to the wounded , some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets			0
the first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives			0
the men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world , and the medical students who hurried to help , saying “ when we heard , we all came in			0
” the priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful			0
and the good people of @entity74 who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by @entity296 if you want to know who we are , what @entity39 is , how we respond to evil -- that ’s it			1
unafraid.in the coming days , we will pursue every effort to get to the bottom of what happened			0
and we will continue to remain vigilant			0
i ’ve directed my administration to take appropriate security measures to protect the @entity39 people			1
and this is a good time for all of us to remember that we all have a part to play in alerting authorities -- if you see something suspicious , speak @entity313 have extraordinary confidence in the men and women of the @entity9 , the @entity317 , and the other agencies that responded so heroically and effectively in the aftermath of yesterday ’s events			0
i ’m very grateful for the leadership of governor @entity322 and @entity323			0
and i know that even as we protect our people and aggressively pursue this investigation , the people of @entity74 will continue to respond in the same proud and heroic way that they have thus far -- and their fellow @entity39 will be right there with @entity328 you very much			1
and you can expect further briefings from our law enforcement officials as the day goes on			0
when we have more details , they will be disclosed			0
what i ’ve indicated to you is what we know now			0
we know it was bombs that were set off			0
we know that obviously they did some severe damage			0
we do not know who did them			0
we do not know whether this was an act of an organization or an individual or individuals			0
we do n’t have a sense of motive yet			0
so everything else at this point is speculation			0
but as we receive more information , as the @entity9 has more information , as our out counterterrorism teams have more information , we will make sure to keep you and the @entity39 people posted.thank you very much , everybody .			1

' the @entity39 people will not be terrorized , ' @entity1 said in a speech that evoked president @entity362 in @entity363 after 9/11
senators from both sides of the aisle call bombings ' terrorism '
the president makes his first use of the ' t ' - word , and says it three times
says @entity39 will respond ' selflessly , *compassionately* , unafraid '
