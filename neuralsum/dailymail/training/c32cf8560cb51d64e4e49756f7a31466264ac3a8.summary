by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 12 september 2013 a lorry driver has thought of a novel way to keep his beloved dog safe at work - making her wear a @entity6 jacket			1
trucker @entity7 , 58 , has taken 10 - year - old @entity9 to work every day for the past year to keep him company on long drives up and down the country			1
and although she rarely leaves the cab of the lorry , mr @entity7 makes the cross breed @entity15 wear a tiny high - visibility jacket while at work - just in case			1
safety first ! 10 - year - old @entity9 the dog wears her @entity6 jacket to work everyday standing out : although @entity9 , a cross-breed @entity15 , rarely leaves the cab of the lorry mr @entity7 likes to make sure she is safe by wearing her jacket mr @entity7 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , says @entity9 usually sits in the passenger seat looking out of the window as he delivers bricks and concrete			1
he says she is great company for his 12 - hour shifts , and he could n't imagine life on the road without her			1
speaking on thursday , mr @entity7 said : ' i put her jacket on at 6am , she looks quite funny in it but she needs it for health and safety reasons , and then we both jump in the lorry and off we go until 6pm that evening			1
' i have to take @entity9 to work with me as i am single and have no one to look after her at home - but i love it			2
' people love her , she ’s so friendly and she loves the ride , she does n’t go to sleep , she is quite a nosy dog so sticks her head out the window most of the time			0
' obviously on some days we hit a bit of traffic and if we pull up alongside a family with kids , they love her and she loves them , she ’s just so friendly and great company			0
@entity58 : mr @entity7 says @entity9 certainly turns heads in her jacket ' we ’re together for 24 hours a day , we ’re best mates , she is just like a child to me and is like a mascot for the firm			1
' i ’ve had her since she was born , i bred her , so we have a strong bond			2
' but she is n’t just a delight to be with when she ’s with me , all the guys at work love her too			0
' she ’s friendly to everyone and is just a ball of life			0
' @entity71 , 54 , the company director at @entity72 , where @entity7 works said that the animal has proved a popular addition to the team			0
he said : “ @entity9 is a very pleasant and small dog			0
good company : mr @entity7 says @entity9 , who usually sits in the passenger seat and watches out of the window on long drives , is great company on his shifts ' she is very friendly and goes everywhere with @entity7 , she sits in the passenger seat and stays there all day			1
' she does n’t leave the vehicle and she ’s not allowed on the site for health and safety reasons			2
“ so she just looks out the window in her little high - vis jacket and people seem to respond in a nice way to her			0
' it is unusual , but it brings a smile to people ’s faces when they see her			0
' @entity9 has been here for around 12 months now , he has brought her along since virtually his first day of work			2
' however , she is somewhat of an exception , if other workers started bringing in their dogs and other pets we would have to stop it			0
' we understand the reason for @entity7 bringing @entity9 to work and we are fine with that			2

10 - year - old @entity9 accompanies @entity7 , 58 , on 12 - hour shifts every day
rarely leaves the lorry , but wears her jacket for safety reasons
mr @entity7 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , says everyone at work loves the cross-breed @entity15
' we have a strong bond , ' mr @entity7 says
