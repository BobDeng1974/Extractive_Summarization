weekly attacks : @entity1 experienced severe allergic reactions to mould as the autumn damp sets in , the temptation is to stay inside and turn up the radiator			1
but if there 's not enough ventilation , you could be creating the perfect environment for mould to grow			1
@entity11 can trigger breathing problems and may even , in rare cases , be life - threatening - as @entity1 discovered			1
last november , the 17 - year - old was at school when she suddenly started struggling to breathe			2
' i was sitting in class and my throat began to close up and then my tongue started to swell - i ran to the first aid room , ' recalls @entity1 who lives in @entity21 , @entity22 , with her mother @entity23 , 43 , a teacher , stepfather @entity25 , 40 , a cab driver , and younger siblings , @entity27 and @entity28			2
within minutes , large itchy red hives - about an inch in diameter - had started to appear on her arms and chest			1
luckily , a paramedic arrived within ten minutes and gave her an adrenaline injection ; this calmed down her symptoms , but she was still rushed to hospital in an ambulance , where she was also given steroids			2
@entity1 had experienced an extreme anaphylactic reaction - a severe allergic reaction where the body 's immune system goes into overdrive , releasing large amounts of histamine , a chemical that causes tissue to swell			2
this can lead to breathing problems and a drop in blood pressure			2
after eight hours in hospital , @entity1 was well enough to go home			0
but the mystery was what caused the attack			0
although she suffers from hay fever and oral allergy syndrome - where certain foods , in her case , fresh fruit , cause her mouth to tingle and lips to swell temporarily - there was nothing to suggest these were the problem			0
' i had n't eaten anything out of the ordinary , ' recalls @entity1			0
her gp referred her to an allergy specialist , but there was a three - month wait			0
in the meantime she had at least one anaphylactic reaction every week , always at school			0
' scarily the symptoms developed more rapidly each time - i took antihistamines every day to prevent an attack and carried two epipens of adrenaline at all times , which i used			0
' although my symptoms would quickly die down , i was told to go to @entity89 each time in case there were problems when the adrenaline wore off			0
it was terrifying , ' says @entity1			0
she was also told to rest for at least a week after each attack			0
' my attendance levels dropped to below 60 per cent			0
i was in my first year of a-levels and every class i missed set me back			0
it began to affect my grades			0
mould allergy : the fungus , like the black variety found on window frames , thrives in damp , moist conditions ' the school helped and teachers came to my home when i was off sick , but without knowing the trigger , there was little they could do			1
' she was advised to restrict her diet , so ate the same thing every day - mainly oat cereal and bread - but it made no difference			0
' i became very anxious and quite depressed because home was about the only place i felt safe and i missed out on a lot of things			0
i do n't think my friends believed it when i said i was allergic to school			0
' when @entity1 eventually saw an allergy specialist at @entity127 , @entity128 , in january , tests revealed she had allergies to pollen , peanuts and sesame , but her strongest allergy was to mould - particularly cladosporium herbarum , a mould found on window frames , fridges and poorly ventilated buildings			1
as @entity1 explains : ' my school building was old and quite damp and one class was in a temporary hut - it had condensation on the window sills and black mould on a wall			1
this was where i had the majority of attacks			0
' after @entity150 knew about my mould allergy she opened all our windows regularly and bought a dehumidifier for my room			1
but i never had an attack at home , so obviously it was something at school setting me off			0
' @entity11 is a type of fungus - thousands of types are released at different times of the year , though autumn is the peak time for the release of the spores ( the microscopic particles that allow it to spread )			1
the spores can irritate skin , nasal and bronchial membranes , causing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness , itchy eyes , coughing , wheezing , and eczema			1
up to 4 per cent of the population is thought to react to mould spores - with as many as one in ten people with allergies such as hay fever and eczema affected			1
@entity11 spores can also be dangerous for some asthmatics - around two - thirds of the more serious life - threatening asthma attacks are believed to be triggered by moulds , although anaphylactic reactions such as those @entity1 had ( causing changes in blood pressure , for instance ) are fortunately rare			1
dr @entity196 , consultant paediatric allergy specialist at @entity197 , @entity128 , and the private @entity198 , says late autumn is the peak time for mould allergies due to the wet conditions and fallen leaves , and people spending more time indoors with windows shut , which leads to condensation forming			1
' i do n't think my friends believed it when i said i was allergic to school			0
' ' @entity11 thrives in damp , moist , tepid conditions , indoors and out			1
the black mould on window frames is an obvious type , but you 'll also find mould in steamy kitchens and bathrooms , and barns where mouldy hay is stored , or musty sheds or garages , ' says dr @entity196			1
' if your house has damp , it is the ideal environment for mould to thrive			1
patients are often puzzled about what is causing their allergic symptoms , as they do n't tend to think of mould being a trigger			1
' @entity232 , deputy chief executive of @entity233 , stresses that mould can grow in centrally heated , double - glazed homes as well as old damp houses and overcrowded flats : ' if the house is n't well ventilated , mould will flourish			1
' certain mould species can also cause serious lung infections and damage			1
@entity244 , for instance , colonises vegetable matter ( especially wet or rotting ) and can be found on farms where produce is stored , or in old buildings			0
the spores can trigger an allergic reaction ( usually asthma ) and , in rare cases , it can damage tissue in the lungs and affect breathing			1
aspergillus can be a problem for people with serious pre-existing lung diseases , says consultant chest physician dr @entity260 , who advises the @entity264			2
' there 's another condition called farmer 's lung , where lungs are colonised by spores from mouldy hay			1
it can cause scarring of the lung , make patients breathless and even prove fatal , ' he says			2
irritation : spores can cause symptoms such as nasal stuffiness , itchy eyes , coughing , wheezing , and eczema @entity11 may also be linked to @entity284			1
a new @entity286 study found a compound given off by mould reduced levels of the brain chemical dopamine , a process which causes @entity284 's symptoms , although more research is needed			2
as well as eliminating existing mould with anti-mould products , experts advise opening windows every day to release moist air , using dehumidifiers and fitting ventilation fans in kitchens and bathrooms			2
avoid drying washing indoors , particularly on radiators , and keep pot plants to a minimum ( topsoil can harbour mould )			2
dr @entity309 , a toxicologist , epidemiologist and senior research fellow at the @entity313 's @entity312 at the @entity314 , says : ' @entity11 thrives in any building where there 's insufficient ventilation and condensation happens			1
' climate change experts say the weather in the @entity321 will get wetter and warmer , and mould thrives in wet conditions and warm temperatures , so mould - related health problems will probably increase , too			1
' for mould - related allergies , prevention and treatment is with antihistamines , with oral steroids sometimes used to treat flare - ups			2
but in severe cases dr @entity196 says the patient is exposed to an allergen in hospital conditions in progressively larger doses , so that the immune system eventually becomes desensitised and does not react			0
@entity1 ended up changing schools to combat her attacks			0
since doing this in september she 's had just two attacks			0
' i still worry about attacks though - i want to go to university to study law , but i 'm nervous about moving away from home and having to live in an unknown environment			0
' i want people to know just how serious mould allergies can be			2

mould spores can cause nasal stuffiness , itchy eyes , coughing , eczema
4 *%* of the population reacts to the spores , which can cause lung damage
@entity11 thrives in the damp ; if your house is tepid , mould will grow there
