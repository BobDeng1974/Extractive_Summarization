computer scientists have developed a new type of software that not only detects and eradicates never - before - seen viruses and malware , but automatically repairs damage caused by them too			1
the software , named @entity8 , then prevents a hacker ever infecting the computer again			1
it works with a virtual computer that emulates the operations of a specific machine and is designed to watch over the virtual machine ’s operating system and applications			0
the software , called @entity8 , then prevents a hacker ( illustrated with a stock picture ) ever infecting a computer again			1
it works with a virtual computer that emulates the operations of a specific machine and is designed to watch over the virtual machine ’s operating system and applications @entity27 , research assistant professor of @entity29 at the @entity30 , explained that @entity8 is intended to protect servers and business computers that run on the @entity34 operating system , as well as military machines			1
in the future it could be adapted for home laptops too			2
‘ @entity8 technologies could find their way into consumer products someday , which would help consumer devices protect themselves against fast - spreading malware or internal corruption of software components			1
but we have n’t tried those experiments yet , ’ he said			0
the team , including professor @entity50 , created ‘ stackable debuggers ’ that run on top of each other and look inside the virtual machine while it is running to search for any unusual behaviour			0
unlike a normal virus scanner on a consumer pc , that compares a catalogue of known viruses to something that has infected the computer , @entity8 can detect new , unknown viruses or malware automatically by sensing that something unusual is occurring in the computer ’s operation			1

at the moment , it can protect servers and computers that run on the @entity34 operating system			2

unlike a normal virus scanners on consumer pcs that compare a catalogue of known viruses to something that has infected the computer , @entity8 can detect new , unknown viruses or malware automatically by sensing that something is occurring in the computer ’s operation that is not correct			1
it can then stop the virus , repair damaged code and learn not to let the bug access the machine again			0
it can then stop the virus , repair damaged code and learn not to let the bug access the machine again			0
as well as boosting cyber security for military missions , @entity8 could be used by web services such as @entity101 , which if attacked by a virus , could repair its service in minutes without having to take the servers down and stop customers from shopping			1
to demonstrate the power of the system , the researchers , together with @entity111 - based defence contractor , @entity110 , showed officials from the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) how their software copes with a software bug called @entity116			0
@entity117 was a software vulnerability discovered last september that affected many web servers and most @entity121 laptops and desktops , which allowed a hacker to control a machine			2
within the first 24 hours of the disclosure of @entity116 , security researchers reported that more than 17,000 attacks by hackers had been made with the bug			0
@entity8 is intended to protect servers and business computers that run on the @entity34 operating system , as well as military machines ( illustrated by the briefing room of general @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 )			1
it could in the future be adapted for home laptops too military : the software could be used to provide extra protection for sensitive military machines			1
business : @entity8 could be used by web services such as @entity101 , which if attacked by a virus , could repair its service in minutes without having to take the servers down and stop customers from shopping			2
consumers : @entity8 could be adapted for home laptops to help consumer devices protect themselves against fast - spreading malware or internal corruption of software components			1
@entity8 discovered the @entity158 attack on a web server and repaired the damage in four minutes , professor @entity27 said			2
the team also tested @entity8 successfully on another six pieces of malware			0
he said : ‘ it is a pretty big deal that a computer system could automatically , and in a short amount of time , find an acceptable fix to a widespread and important security vulnerability			2
’ ‘ it ’s pretty cool when you can pick the " @entity173 " and it works			0
’ the team will work on a way of using @entity8 in cloud computing next			0
while the software is open source – and free to use – it will probably be incorporated into commercial products .			0

computer scientists at the @entity30 , developed the @entity8 software
it *'s* intended to protect business and military computers and servers
software could be adapted to one day protect laptops at home
it can detect new and unknown viruses and automatically fix damage
*program* also learns to not let the bug back into a machine
