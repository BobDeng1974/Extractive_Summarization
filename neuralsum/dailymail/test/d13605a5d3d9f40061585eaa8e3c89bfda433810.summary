@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we learned from the @entity6 's @entity5 weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the @entity9			1
playing @entity10 as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for @entity15 manager @entity14			1
the @entity17 star , who has taken over the captain ’s armband in the absence of @entity21 , gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at @entity25			2
@entity10 ( left ) toiled as a wing back in @entity15 's defeat against @entity25 and lost the ball 23 times @entity10 , usually a central midfielder , has not given the ball away as much all season for @entity15 there has n’t been a single one of his previous 29 @entity6 appearances this season in which he ’s lost possession more			1
@entity35 has clearly learned the canny defender ’s art of letting his brain do all the running			0
the theory is if you get in the right position in the first place , you do n’t have to chase to recover			0
in 90 minutes of helping @entity44 keep a clean sheet against @entity46 , the @entity47 international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the @entity51 performance data			1
it clearly works for him – he ’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole @entity6 outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season			1
@entity60 only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in @entity44 's 1 - 0 win over @entity46 @entity60 ( third left ) celebrated @entity44 's win with @entity65 when the final whistle was blown for good measure he ’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five @entity68			1
@entity70 ’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at @entity72 but there are signs the former @entity75 and @entity77 centre half is returning to his best			0
the 23 - year - old was a towering figure as a @entity81 side led by the powerful figure of substitute @entity83 fought to recover from being three goals down at half - time			0
@entity70 ( right ) wins a header against @entity81 striker @entity87 @entity70 made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the @entity90 back four put together – and more than any other @entity6 defender all weekend			1
@entity92 need have few fears if @entity95 ’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on @entity96 for goals in the last eight games of the season			2
the @entity101 international ’s tap - in from @entity104 ’s pass for the winner against @entity106 was his fifth @entity6 goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch			1
@entity96 ( centre ) scored @entity92 's winner in their 2 - 1 victory over @entity106 at @entity112 on saturday @entity96 could be vital to @entity92 as they look to win the @entity6 title after @entity95 went off injured that ’s a goal every 91 minutes – actually a better ratio than @entity95 whose 19 @entity6 goals have come at the rate of one every 103 minutes			1
@entity120 boss @entity119 has talked about stability all season and continues to practise what he preaches			0
he picked an unchanged side for the 16th time this season for the home clash with @entity75 and was rewarded with a valuable point			0
@entity119 selected an unchanged side for the 16th time as @entity120 drew 0 - 0 with @entity75 on sunday that ’s more than double the number of times any other club has kept the same starting xi – next highest is @entity134 with seven			1
@entity135 looked to have lost his first - team place at @entity134 a few weeks ago following the arrival from @entity92 of veteran @entity138			0
but the 28 - year - old son of @entity141 legend @entity139 returned for the 4 - 3 defeat at @entity75 just before the international break , and justified @entity145 ’s decision to keep him in the side with a brilliant display in the 2 - 1 win over @entity149			2
@entity135 made a string of outstanding stops as @entity134 beat @entity149 2 - 1 @entity135 made six saves as well as several vital catches – the only time he has made more saves in a game this season was the eight at @entity92 back in august that stopped a 2 - 0 defeat becoming a rout			1
@entity161 boss @entity160 shared the club ’s rise from football ’s basement to the @entity6 as a player , and is n’t afraid to back his belief there are more in @entity169 with the potential to play at the top			2
he put his club ’s money where his mouth is by signing @entity175 from @entity176 for £ 1.75million in january , and has now given the 19 - year - old his debut in the top flight			0
@entity175 ( right ) impressed in his substitute appearance for @entity161 in the 3 - 1 win against @entity181 it was n’t a bad little cameo , either			2
@entity161 scored their third in the 3 - 1 win over @entity181 barely a minute after @entity175 came on			2
@entity187 boss @entity186 left striker @entity188 out of his starting side for the 0 - 0 @entity191 quarter - final at @entity15 – but surely ca n’t drop him again for wednesday ’s replay			1
the 25 - year - old @entity193 international is in the best scoring form of even his prolific career after netting the second of the 3 - 0 win at @entity199			1
it was his eighth goal in the last 12 games for @entity187 and took his total for the season to 17 from 35 championship starts			0
@entity188 ( right ) scores @entity187 's second goal against @entity199 in the @entity206 on saturday 9			0
@entity208 fan @entity207 admitted he was upset at missing out on the celebrations when his old club clinched top spot in the @entity206 a few weeks ago			0
but the midfielder who moved to @entity213 in january might yet be able to open some bubbly with his new club after scoring in the 2 - 0 derby win at @entity216			1
it was the 22 - year - old 's third in as many games and gave @entity220 ’s side a seven - point cushion for a place in the @entity224 play - off zone			0
midfielder @entity207 ( left ) is proving important to @entity213 's hopes of going up a division @entity227 celebrates scoring for @entity228 , where he has found the net 30 times in the league this season 10			0
@entity227 has a peculiar place in the football history books for being the first player sold by an internet vote of fans – he was a promising teenager at @entity236 in 2008 when the online poll decided to let him move to @entity238			0
the striker ’s move never worked out – but seven years and nine clubs later he ’s setting records again and this time for much better reasons			0
his finish against @entity248 that took @entity228 back to the top of the @entity250 was his 30th @entity9 goal of the season , equalling @entity245 ’s club record set in 1991 .			2

@entity10 struggled being played as a wing back for @entity15
@entity60 captained @entity44 to a crucial 1 - 0 win over @entity46
@entity96 got a fifth @entity6 goal in only 456 minutes this season
