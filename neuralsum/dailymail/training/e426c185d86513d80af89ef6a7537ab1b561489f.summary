today , @entity1 's surface is an arid desert - but the @entity5 's @entity4 spacecraft has returned strong evidence for an ocean once covering part of the red planet 's surface			1
using radar , the orbiter has detected sediments reminiscent of an ocean floor within the boundaries of areas previously picked out as ancient shorelines on @entity1			1
the ocean would have covered the northern plains billions of years ago			2
the radar detected sediments reminiscent of an ocean floor inside previously identified , ancient shorelines on the red planet the @entity4 spacecraft found evidence of sediment on the surface - possibly from earlier oceans @entity30 of @entity31 , and colleagues have analyzed more than two years of data and found that the northern plains are covered in low - density material			1
' we interpret these as sedimentary deposits , maybe ice - rich , ' says dr. @entity30			0
' it is a strong new indication that there was once an ocean here			0
the existence of oceans on ancient @entity1 has been suspected before - and spacecraft have previously identified ' shores '			1
the sediment deposits are further evidence of @entity1 's watery past - with researchers saying oceans might have covered the planet twice , once four billion years ago , when warmer conditions prevailed , and also the billion years ago when subsurface ice melted following a large impact			1
the orbiter 's @entity54 radar scans the subsurface , and revealed tell - tale sediment that could have come from an ancient ocean the scientists say that the most recent ocean on @entity1 , three billion years ago , would have dried too quickly to play host to life - but the older ocean could have contained life ' our radar penetrates deep into the ground , revealing the first 60 - 80 meters of the planet ’s subsurface , t says @entity71 , leader of the radar team			1
' throughout all of this depth , we see the evidence for sedimentary material and ice			0
' the sediments revealed by @entity54 are areas of low radar reflectivity such sediments are typically low - density granular materials that have been eroded away by water and carried to their final destination			2
the second ocean , three billion years ago , would however have been temporary			1
within a million years or less , dr. @entity30 estimates , the water would have either frozen back in place and been preserved underground again , or turned into vapor and lifted gradually into the atmosphere			0
' i do n’t think it could have stayed as an ocean long enough for life to form			0
' in order to find evidence of life , astrobiologists will have to look even further back in @entity1 ’ history when liquid water existed for much longer periods			2
' previous @entity4 results about water on @entity1 came from the study of images and mineralogical data , as well as atmospheric measurements			0
now we have the view from the subsurface radar , ' says @entity112 , @entity5 ’s @entity113			0
' this adds new pieces of information to the puzzle but the questionremains : where did all the water go ? '			0

oceans across north pole of planet
identified by radar scan of surface from @entity1 orbiter
' oceans ' fall within boundaries of ' shores ' previously seen by space scans
area covered by oceans twice - last time three billion years ago
