by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 02:22 est , 10 september 2012 if you think your tax bill must be a mistake , you could well be right			0
well over half the complaints made against the taxman are upheld by @entity7 ’ own internal complaints system			1
of 58,110 complaints received in the year to the end of march 2011 , @entity7 found against itself in 57 per cent of cases , while its performance is getting steadily worse , according to internal data			1
grievances submitted by individuals and small businesses range from poor treatment by @entity7 staff to delays and errors in the tax bill			1
in the wrong : well over half of complaints about the taxman were upheld , according to @entity7 ' own internal complaints system ‘ the number of cases where @entity7 has admitted it got something wrong is remarkable , ’ said @entity26 , legal director at law firm @entity27			1
‘ it suggests that if you make a complaint to @entity7 , they ’ll probably decide you ’re right , at least in part			0
’ he said many taxpayers are unaware that they can use @entity7 ’s internal complaints system to reclaim substantial sums , even if their tax bill is correct			1
other reasons to claim money back include mistreatment by @entity7 staff and errors which force taxpayers to incur financial costs			1
‘ many complaints result in @entity7 writing a tax liability off or offering compensation - and quite a lot of money can be at stake , ’ said mr @entity26			1
‘ @entity7 is prone to making errors			0
it ’s unfortunate , but it ’s true			0
’ he blamed budget cuts for reducing the amount of skilled employees on @entity7 ’s ‘ frontline ’ , as well as the ‘ massively increased complexity ’ of the tax system in the past fifteen years			1
many of the complaints concern @entity7 ’s @entity64 , which chases taxpayers who deemed to owe money to @entity7			1
the @entity64 does not judge whether @entity7 is right to claim the money back and some taxpayers have complained that it has pursued innocent people in a ‘ heavy - handed ’ manner			0
‘ the @entity64 are n’t there to negotiate , so even if @entity7 has made a mistake , the @entity64 wo n’t back off until it has what it ’s been asked to retrieve or been informed of a mistake by @entity7 , ’ said mr @entity26			0
getting it wrong : complaints against the @entity7 , whose @entity76 are pictured , ranged from errors with tax bills to poor treatment by staff ‘ it ’s a very unpleasant and distressing experience			1
’ the lawyer said complaints about @entity7 were on the increase , partly due to a growing tendency to use private sector contractors for debt collection			1
even complaints that can not be resolved internally by @entity7 and go instead to an independent adjudicator are increasingly decided in favour of the taxpayer , the figures show			2
in 2011 - 12 , @entity7 paid £ 363,954 in compensation and dropped tax demands worth £ 968,782 , meaning it made errors that cost it £ 1.3m			2
by comparison , mistakes cost @entity7 just £ 470,608 in 2005 - 06 , the first year after the @entity99 was merged with @entity100			0
‘ for performance to get worse over time is incredibly disappointing , ’ said mr @entity26			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ @entity7 serves millions of people every year , and received just under 75,000 complaints in 2011/12			2
‘ about 2 per cent of these complaints were investigated by the @entity107 , indicating that we successfully resolve the vast majority of complaints we receive from customers			0
‘ @entity7 takes complaints very seriously ; we want people to be able to tell us when we make mistakes and our service falls short			2
‘ complaints not only allow us to put things right for the individual but also tell us where we need to learn lessons and improve our services for all our customers			0
’ @entity121 : the @entity7 spokesman added : ’ we are making real improvements to our customer services , boosting staff in contact centres by 1000 and turning around post faster than ever			2
such improvements will reduce the level of complaints going forward			0
