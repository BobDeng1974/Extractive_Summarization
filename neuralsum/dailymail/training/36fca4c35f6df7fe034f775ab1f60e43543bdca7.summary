missing airliner @entity0 is ' very likely ' to be found and is probably in good condition despite being submerged for ten months , according to the @entity4 leading the search			2
@entity5 said he is confident of finding the aircraft - which disappeared en route from @entity8 to @entity9 on march 8 with 239 people on board - but admitted it would take a while			1
apart from some mysterious satellite ' pings ' interpreted as plotting its southern course , no sign of the jet has been found despite a massive air and sea operation			1
' three vessels , with a fourth on the way , are probing the depths of the @entity35 off @entity36 where the @entity38 plane carrying 239 people , mostly @entity40 , is believed to have crashed			1
relatives of those on board have endured a long wait for answers on what happened to their loved ones , with their torment reawakened by @entity49 crashing into the sea off @entity51 on december 28			0
so far , one quarter of the priority underwater search area of 60,000 square kilometres ( 23,166 square miles ) has been checked , while a wider zone of 208,000 square kilometres has been mapped			2
@entity55 ( pictured ) , is one of three vessels currently conducting a high - resolution search for missing @entity0 searching device : an image of a @entity55 's autonomous underwater vehicle searching for flight mh370 ' our satellite calculations gave us an area we determined was high priority , ' @entity5 , the chief commissioner of the @entity63 , which is leading the search , told @entity69			1
' in this 60,000 square kilometres , it 's very likely we will find the aircraft , but we do n't know exactly where			0
we just have to cover that area thoroughly until we find the aircraft			2
' the priority search began in early october and will accelerate over the next few months as weather conditions improve , with the hunt expected to wrap up in may			0
if the jet is not found , a decision on extending the investigation would be made by @entity36 and @entity79 , which have jointly shouldered the cost			0
mr @entity5 said mapping had led to the discovery of previously unknown undersea features such as mountains , volcanos , chasms and a rough , uneven sea floor , highlighting the challenges			1
to take a closer look at the complex terrain , the @entity4 and @entity79 governments said wednesday they were jointly funding the fourth ship , @entity93 , to join the probe later this month			1
desperate : a @entity79 woman reads a board filled with messages for the passengers of missing @entity0 at @entity99 on march 25 last year tragedy : people stand beside the arrival board showing the missing @entity0 flight at @entity104 on march 8 last year while the other three vessels -- @entity107 , @entity55 and @entity108 -- use sophisticated sonar systems attached to tow cables up to 10 kilometres ( 6.2 miles ) long , the supporter will have an autonomous underwater vehicle			1
' ( it ) can be programmed and cover areas much more thoroughly			0
it 's of course a lot slower , ' mr @entity5 said , adding that about five percent of the search area needed the closer scrutiny			1
' we need to go slow so that we can be 100 percent sure that we have covered that area totally			0
' the underwater probe is taking place in treacherous surface conditions with waves as high as 12 metres			0
authorities believe the plane may be sitting on the ocean floor at depths of 4,000 metres			1
but the deep sea plays an important role in preserving the aircraft if that was its resting place , mr @entity5 said			1
tribute : a visitor writes on a placard carrying messages for the passengers of missing @entity0 in @entity8 in june continued efforts : a crew member on an @entity4 search plane scours the ocean during the first month of last year 's search for flight mh370 ' at the likely depth we think the aircraft is , around about 4,000 metres below the sea surface , there 's very little going on there ... that 's likely to affect the components of the aircraft we are looking for , ' he said			1
' the second is that down there there 's very little or no oxygen , so there 's not anything in the way of oxidisation or decay going on with aircraft parts			0
' the sonar equipment we are using means that -- even if there 's an amount of silt or other things -- we can still locate the aircraft parts			0
' we are confident there 's going to be enough visible parts of the aircraft for us to be able to detect it			2
' authorities have drawn up a recovery plan if the plane is found			2
the proposal , which is still being assessed , would use technology and techniques similar to those deployed to recover @entity183 flight af447			0
the @entity185 flag carrier , including its ' black box ' flight data recorder , was hauled from the @entity188 nearly two years after it crashed en route from @entity190 to @entity191 on june 1 , 2009 , killing all 228 on board			2
some Â£ 65million has so far been jointly committed by @entity36 and @entity79 to fund the search			0
