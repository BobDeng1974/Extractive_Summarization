details of an amazing @entity2 military plan for an attack to wipe out a major part of the @entity5 are today revealed for the first time			1
in 1930 , a mere nine years before the outbreak of @entity9 , @entity7 drew up proposals specifically aimed at eliminating all @entity12 land forces in @entity13 and the @entity14 , thus destroying @entity12 's trading ability and bringing the country to its knees			1
previously unparalleled troop movements were launched as an overture to an invasion of @entity13 , which was to include massive bombing raids on key industrial targets and the use of chemical weapons , the latter signed off at the highest level by none other than the legendary general @entity28			1
the plans , revealed in a @entity31 documentary , were one of a number of military contingency plans drawn up against a number of potential enemies , including the @entity38 islands and @entity39			2
there was even one to combat an internal uprising within the @entity2			2
in the end there was no question of president @entity45 subscribing to what was known as @entity47			1
instead the two countries became the firmest of allies during @entity9 , an occasionally strained alliance that continues to this day			2
still , it is fascinating that there were enough people inside the @entity2 political and military establishment who thought that such a war was feasible			1
while outside of @entity7 , both @entity58 and @entity59 also thought it a possibility during the 30s - a time of deep economic and political uncertainty			1
in 1930 , a mere nine years before the outbreak of @entity9 , @entity7 drew up a terrifying plan specifically aimed at eliminating all @entity12 land forces in @entity13 and the @entity14 , thus destroying @entity12 's trading ability and bringing our country to its knees the top - secret papers seen here - once regarded as the most sensitive on @entity71 - were found buried deep within the @entity72 in @entity73 the highly classified files reveal that huge pushes were to be made into the @entity38 and @entity76 to block any @entity12 retaliation from either @entity78 , @entity79 or @entity80			1
in 1931 , the @entity2 government even authorised record - breaking transatlantic flying hero and known @entity84 sympathiser @entity83 to be sent covertly as a spy to the west shore of @entity87 to investigate the possibility of using sea - planes for warfare and seek out points of low resistance as potential bridgeheads			2
in 1931 , the @entity2 authorised flying hero and known @entity84 sympathiser @entity83 to be sent as a spy to @entity87 to look into using sea - planes for warfare and seek out points of low resistance as potential bridgeheads four years later , the @entity98 authorised $ 57million to be allocated for the building of three secret airfields on the @entity2 side of the @entity13 border , with grassed - over landing strips to hide their real purpose			1
all governments make ' worst case scenario ' contingency plans which are kept under wraps from the public			0
these documents were unearthed buried deep within the @entity72 in @entity73 - a top - secret document once regarded as the most sensitive on earth			1
it was in 1930 , that @entity7 first wrote a plan for war with ' the @entity116 ' - its most dangerous empire			1
but @entity7 's foe in this war was not @entity120 or @entity121 or even the burgeoning @entity84			2
@entity47 was code for an apocalyptic war with @entity12 and all her dominions			1
after the @entity128 and throughout the 1920s , @entity7 's historic @entity127 feelings handed down from the 19th century were running dangerously high due to our owing the @entity2 £ 9billion for their intervention in @entity133			0
@entity12 feeling against @entity7 was known to be reciprocal			1
by the 1930s , @entity7 saw the disturbing sight of homegrown @entity84 sympathisers marching down @entity139 's @entity138 to converge on a pro-hitler rally in @entity141			0
across the @entity14 , @entity12 had the largest empire in the world , not to mention the most powerful navy			1
against this backdrop , some @entity2 saw their nation emerging as a potential world leader and knew only too well how @entity12 had dealt with such upstarts in the past - it went to war and quashed them			1
now , @entity7 saw itself as the underdog in a similar scenario			0
in 1935 , @entity7 staged its largest - ever military manoeuvres , moving troops to and installing munitions dumps at @entity155 , half an hour away from the eastern @entity13 border			1
by the 1930s , @entity7 saw the disturbing sight of homegrown @entity84 sympathisers marching down @entity139 's @entity138 to converge on a pro-hitler rally in @entity141 it was from here the initial attack on @entity12 citizens would be launched , with @entity161 , @entity162 , its first target			1
' this would have meant six million troops fighting on @entity7 's eastern seaboard , ' says @entity167 , editor of @entity168			0
during the 1920s and 30s , the @entity2 devised several colour - coded war plans to deal with potential adversaries			1
many of these war games were submitted to the @entity174 by officers working in their own time			2
among the contingency plans developed were : @entity178 : war against @entity121 green : @entity180 purple : @entity7 white : domestic uprising black : @entity84 grey : @entity38 republics yellow : @entity39 @entity184 : @entity185 not surprisingly , many of these were hypothetical exercises - and provided only broad strategic outlines			1
however , the planning was considered by the military to be good practice for its personnel			0
' it would have been like @entity195 , ' alluding to the brutal conflict between @entity198 and @entity199 troops in 1916 which resulted in a death toll of 306,000			0
even @entity58 said while people regarded a war with the @entity2 as inconceivable , it was not			1
' @entity7 felt @entity12 had thrown it under the bus in order to stay top dog , ' says professor @entity207 , of the @entity208			1
' the @entity2 was forced to contemplate any measure to keep @entity12 at bay			1
' even @entity59 thought such a war was inevitable , but astonishingly wanted @entity12 to win , believing that to be the best outcome for @entity84 , since the @entity12 could then join his forces to attack the @entity2 ' you have to remember the @entity2 was born out of a revolutionary struggle against @entity12 in 1776 , ' says dr. @entity217 , of the @entity208			1
using available blueprints for this war , modern - day military and naval experts now believe the most likely outcome of such a conflict would have been a massive naval battle in the @entity14 with very few actual deaths , but ending with @entity12 handing @entity13 over to the @entity2 in order to preserve our vital trade routes			1
however , on june 15 , 1939 , the same year as the @entity198 invasion of @entity230 , an internal @entity2 memo states these plans for an invasion were ' wholly inapplicable ' , but nevertheless ' should be retained ' for the future			0
this is now seen as the dawn of and prime reason behind the ' special relationship ' between our two countries			0
huge troop movements were launched as an overture to an invasion of @entity13 , which was to include bombing raids on industrial targets and the use of chemical weapons - the latter signed off by the legendary general @entity28 , left ( file picture ) @entity250 , prosperity and decline : @entity7 after @entity133 as close allies in numerous conflicts , @entity12 and @entity7 have long enjoyed a ' special relationship '			1
stemming from @entity256 and @entity45 , it has since flourished - from @entity257 and @entity258 , and @entity259 and @entity260 , to the @entity261 and @entity262			2
we know now that @entity45 ultimately rejected an invasion of @entity12 as ' wholly inapplicable '			1
but just how special was that relationship in the decade leading up to @entity9 ? by the start of the 1920s , the @entity2 economy was booming			0
the ' @entity269 ' was an age of increased consumer spending and mass production			0
but after the @entity133 , @entity2 public opinion was becoming increasingly isolationist			0
this was reflected in its refusal to join the @entity277 , whose principal mission was to maintain world peace			2
@entity2 foreign policy continued to cut itself off from the rest of the world during that period by imposing tariffs on imports to protect domestic manufacturers			2
these children were part of a squatter community , known bitterly as ' @entity291 ' because of the president 's inability to even admit to the existence of a national crisis after the stock market crash in 1929 and its liberal approach to immigration was also changing			0
millions of people , mainly from @entity78 , had previously been welcomed to @entity7 in search of a better life			0
but by 1921 , quotas were introduced and , by 1929 , only 150,000 immigrants per year were allowed in			0
after a decade of prosperity and optimism , @entity7 was thrown into despair when the stock market crashed in october 1929 - marking the start of the @entity310			2
the ensuing economic hardship and mass unemployment sealed the fate of president @entity315 's re-election - and @entity45 stormed to victory in march 1933			2
he was faced with an economy on the brink of collapse : banks had been shut in 32 states , and some 17million people had been thrown out of work — almost a third of the adult workforce			0
and the reality of a worldwide economic depression and the need for increased attention to domestic problems only served to bolster the idea that the @entity2 should isolate itself from troubling events in @entity78			0
when @entity45 was elected as president in 1933 , he was faced with an economy on the brink of collapse			0
banks had been shut in 32 states , and some 17million people had been thrown out of work however , this view was at odds with @entity45 's vision			0
he realised the necessity for the @entity2 to participate more actively in international affairs - but isolationist sentiment remained high in @entity98			2
in 1933 , president @entity45 proposed a @entity98 measure that would have granted him the right to consult with other nations to place pressure on aggressors in international conflicts			0
the bill faced strong opposition from leading isolationists in @entity98			0
as tensions rose in @entity78 over the rise of the @entity357 , @entity98 brought in a set of @entity359 to stop @entity7 becoming entangled in external conflicts			0
although @entity45 was not in favour of the policy , he acquiesced as he still needed @entity98 support for his @entity366 programmes , which were designed to bring the country out of the @entity310			0
by 1937 , the situation in @entity78 was growing worse and the second @entity369 began in @entity370			0
in a speech , he compared international aggression to a disease that other nations must work to ' quarantine '			0
but still , @entity2 were not willing to risk their lives for peace abroad - even when war broke out in @entity78 in 1939			1
a slow shift in public opinion saw limited @entity2 aid to the @entity382			0
and then the @entity121 attack on @entity384 in december 1941 changed everything .			2

emerging world power feared @entity12 *reaction* to its *ambitions*
@entity47 was code for massive war with @entity393
top - secret document once regarded as ' most sensitive on @entity71 '
$ 57m allocated for building secret airfields on @entity13 border - to launch attack on @entity12 land forces based there
