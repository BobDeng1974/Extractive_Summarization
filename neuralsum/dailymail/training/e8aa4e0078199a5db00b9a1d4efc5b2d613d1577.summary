it is the plane that could finally end the argument over who gets the window seat			1
a firm attempting to build a private supersonic jet has revealed a radical new design where the entire cabin wall is a screen that can be turned into a giant window			1
live video from outside the plane can create a panoramic image - or the passengers of the $ 60m jet can opt to have their family snaps shown or even watch a movie on the walls			1
instead , the interior walls will be covered with a thin display screen			1
the spike @entity22 is a supersonic jet that will enable travelers to reach destinations in half the time it currently takes			2
length : 131ftwing span : @entity30 length , height and width : 40ft , 6.2ft and 6.2ftbasic operating weight : @entity34 takeoff and landing weight : @entity37 : @entity39 range : 4,000 nautical miles ( 7,408km ) engines : @entity41 - there are @entity43 : 19,000lbs per @entity45 passenger capacity : @entity47 speed : 1,100mph of @entity48 : $ 60million to $ 80million or £ 36.3million to £ 48.4millionanticipated delivery : december 2018 the @entity50 claims to be the ' first supersonic business jet ' and promises to cut flight times in half so that busy billionaires will be able to travel from @entity55 to @entity56 in just three hours			1
however , such convenience and speed comes at a price , as the jet will cost between $ 60million and $ 80million ( £ 36.3million and £ 48.4million )			2
the engineers , who have previously worked for aerospace giants such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , have spent the past two years designing the luxury aircraft and believe the jet will be capable of flying between @entity55 and @entity56 in three hours			1
@entity68 to @entity69 will take just five hours and @entity56 to @entity70 , four hours , according to the firm			1
‘ it will save passengers time so they can explore more of the world , ' the company said			2
' would n’t you love to go hiking in @entity77 for the weekend , or fly to @entity78 for lunch ? the new supersonic jet will also feature a revolutionary windowless passenger cabin so no more glaring sun and no more shades to pull down or push up			2
instead , the interior walls will be covered with a thin display screens embedded into the wall			1
cameras surrounding the entire aircraft will construct breathtaking panoramic views displayed on the cabin screens			1
passengers will be able to dim the screens to catch some sleep or change it to one of the many scenic images stored in the system			2
' there are several reasons for removing the windows from the cabin , ' the firm said			2
' it has long been known that the windows cause significant challenges in designing and constructing an aircraft fuselage			2
they require addition structural support , add to the parts count and add weight to the aircraft			0
but until recently , it has not been possible to do without them			0
' with the micro-cameras and flat displays now available , @entity50 can eliminate the structural issues with windows and reduce the aircraft weight			0
in addition , the very smooth exterior skin will reduce the drag normally caused by having windows			0
' the jet can cruise cruise at average speeds of @entity125 1.6 - 1.8 ( 1060 - 1200 mph cameras surrounding the entire aircraft will beam panoramic views to the cabin screens			1
passengers will be able to dim the screens to catch some sleep or change it to one of the many scenic images stored in the system			0
‘ the supersonic jet will let you do more , faster , ’ it added			0
the jet , which is designed to carry between 12 and 18 passengers in the lap of luxury , is intended to take off in december 2018			0
however , despite impressive engineering , the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) has banned supersonic flight over the @entity146 making popular flights such as @entity68 to @entity55 unlikely in the near future			1
companies including @entity150 and @entity151 are currently trying to develop supersonic aircraft of their own to reduce the noise - or boom - that the jets make when breaking the sound barrier			0
@entity156 , president and ceo of @entity50 , wrote in a blog that @entity160 , founder of @entity161 and @entity162 , told a @entity55 times @entity164 conference that ' there ’s an interesting opportunity to create a supersonic , electric , vertical take - off and landing jet			1
' ‘ it seems unlikely to come from @entity151 or @entity63 , given that they seem to be focused on very incremental improvements to their planes as opposed to radical improvements			0
so it could come from a start - up			0
¿ it will save passengers time so they can explore more of the world , ' the company said			0
' wouldn ¿ t you love to go hiking in @entity77 for the weekend , or fly to @entity78 for lunch ? ‘ if i were to have another company in the future , which would not be any time soon , i think that would be the thing do , ’ he added			0
mr @entity156 said aspirations of vertical take - off and landing might be ‘ a stretch ’ for the first iteration of a new supersonic aircraft .			0
