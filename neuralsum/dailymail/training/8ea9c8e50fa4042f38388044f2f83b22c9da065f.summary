@entity2 shops should sell @entity4 lamb rather than homegrown meat if they want to help protect the environment , experts have claimed			2
the suggestion , likely to outrage @entity2 farmers , comes after a study found the amount of man - made greenhouse gases from food production is twice as much as previously estimated			1
growing food for sheep , cows and pigs takes up far more land and emits more greenhouse gases than producing crops for human consumption			1
better option ? a @entity4 @entity24 spring lamb standing with its mother and some methods produce more harmful gases than others , they said			0
the study claims @entity2 , for instance , would be better off importing lamb from @entity4 which has been produced more efficiently than on its own farms			2
countries can also not only reduce emissions but make financial savings by being more careful with regards to the way animals are reared			0
costs : emissions could be reduced and money saved by cutting down meat consumption @entity46 representative @entity45 said : ‘ i do n’t think we ’d be coming out in support of that measure , but we ’d need to read the report before commenting on it			1
’ resilient : crops like barley could be used more the study shows food production accounts for up to 29 percent of man - made greenhouse gases			1
looking at emissions across the food system - including forest clearance , fertiliser production and transport - rather than just farming itself - agriculture research organisation @entity58 said much more work was needed to cut climate change emissions from food			0
their report ‘ @entity74 and @entity75 ’ , estimated food production was responsible for a far greater percentage than the @entity71 ’s 14 percent based on a narrower definition of farming			1
‘ from a food point of view ( the @entity71 approach ) does n’t make sense , ’ said @entity78 , who heads the @entity58 research programme on climate change , agriculture and food security			0
many countries could make big cost savings by cutting emissions , he said			0
‘ there are good economic reasons to improve efficiency in agriculture , not just to cut greenhouse gas emissions			0

29 per cent of man - made greenhouse gases come from food production instead of the @entity71 *'s* 14 per cent figure
emissions could be reduced and money saved by importing efficiently reared lamb from @entity4
