@entity0 was today condemned as an attention seeker for calling for race discrimination laws to be scrapped and claiming some @entity3 in @entity4 ' hate us and want to kill us '			1
the @entity7 leader became embroiled in a race row after first suggesting in a tv interview that laws against discrimination should be scrapped , before trying to claim that he never discussed race at all			1
he claimed public concern was fuelled by migrant group who want to ' change who we are and what we are '			2
@entity20 said the remarks were ' deeply concerning ' and @entity22 accused mr @entity0 of wanting to go back to the days when firms put up signs saying ' no blacks , no dogs , no @entity27 '			1
would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour ? ' @entity0 : ' no. we are colour blind			1
we as a party are colour blind			1
' today on @entity52 @entity0 : ' i did n’t mention race at all – it was no part of that interview with @entity38 at all			2
' in a @entity57 documentary , mr @entity0 claimed concern over preventing racial discrimination in employment ' would probably have been valid ' 40 years ago and he would get rid of ' much of ' existing legislation			1
he also described some @entity3 in @entity4 as a ' fifth column living within our country , who hate us and want to kill us '			2
setting out the case for scrapping race laws , mr @entity0 said : ' i think the situation that we now have , where an employer is not allowed to choose between a @entity4 - born person and somebody from @entity73 , is a ludicrous state of affairs			1
' i think that we have taken our relationship with @entity75 to a level that , frankly , has gone against common sense , and certainly against self - interest			0
' i would argue that the law does need changing , and that if an employer wishes to choose , or you can use the word ' discriminate ' if you want to , but wishes to choose to employ a @entity4 - born person , they should be allowed to do so			0
' i think you should be able to choose on the basis of nationality , yes			2
' he added : ' if we 'd sat here 40 years ago , having this conversation , your point [ on the need for anti-discrimination laws ] would probably have been valid			2
i do n't think it is today			0
' prime minister @entity20 used @entity95 to issue a public condemnation of mr @entity0 's comments labour leader @entity98 said the comments were ' wrong , dangerous and divisive ' while @entity101 @entity100 accused mr @entity0 of ' instilling fear ' mr @entity0 was speaking in an interview with ex-equalities watchdog chief @entity38 for a @entity57 documentary , things we wo n't say about race that are true , due to be broadcast next week			1
he claimed the rise of @entity4 - born @entity111 extremists going to fight with @entity112 in @entity113 had fuelled an ' uptick ' in public concern			0
he added : ' i think perhaps one of the reasons the polls show an increasing level of concern is because people do see a fifth column living within our country , who hate us and want to kill us			0
so do n't be surprised if there is n't a slight increase in people 's worries and concerns			0
' you know , when you 've got @entity4 , when you 've got people , born and bred in @entity133 , with @entity4 passports , going out to fight for @entity135 , do n't be surprised if there is n't an uptick in concern			0
there has been an uptick in concern , but does it make us a prejudiced people ? no. ' ' there is an especial problem with some of the people who 've come here and who are of the @entity149 religion who do n't want to become part of our culture			0
' so there is no previous experience , in our history , of a migrant group that comes to @entity4 , that fundamentally wants to change who we are and what we are			0
that is , i think , above everything else , what people are really concerned about			0
' the remarks sparked a furious row , with political opponents accusing the @entity7 leader of fuelling racial tensions			1
mr @entity20 said : ' @entity0 is attention seeking			1
the laws protect people from racial discrimination			0
it 's deeply concerning he does n't understand that			0
' labour leader @entity98 said the comments were ' wrong , dangerous and divisive '			1
mr @entity98 added : ' i believe that @entity4 should be proud of the fact that we are a tolerant country , we 're a country of different faiths , different backgrounds			2
' i believe that the laws we have on equality are an incredibly important part of meeting the very @entity4 value of treating everyone the same whatever their religion			0
' @entity22 mp @entity192 called the comments ' one of the most shocking things i have ever heard ' , suggesting mr @entity0 wanted to take @entity4 back to the days when shops displayed signs reading ' no blacks , no @entity27 ' @entity101 @entity100 accused mr @entity0 of ' instilling fear ' by conflating problems like violent extremism and @entity203 law with the issue of employment legislation			1
@entity22 's shadow justice secretary @entity192 said : ' this is one of the most shocking things i have ever heard from a mainstream politician and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance			2
' when my parents moved to @entity211 they frequently saw signs saying ' no blacks , no dogs , no @entity27 ' : what @entity7 is suggesting would take us back to those days			1
' a @entity7 spokesperson said : ' we do n't think there 's anything controversial in what @entity0 has said , at least not [ for ] the vast majority of the country			1
' mr @entity0 later claimed his comments had been taken out of context			2
he said in a statement : ' my comments to @entity38 were lauding the progress of race relations and equality in this country			0
@entity4 's media should be proud of this fact instead of trying to do it down			0
' @entity7 is the only party that is suggesting that @entity4 's employers should be free to employ @entity4 workers , regardless of creed or colour			1
it was n't that long ago that the @entity22 called for ' @entity4 jobs for @entity4 workers '			1
' and i suggest the real racists in our society are those who hear me say ` @entity4 ' and think ` white '			0
i 'm the only leader arguing for @entity4 's employers to favour @entity4 workers , no matter what their colour			2
' and i must say , given the unemployment rates amongst young people , i 'm now the only party leader standing up for them , black , white , or otherwise			0
