by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 1 november 2013 hundreds of pregnant women may have had healthy babies aborted after scanning blunders at a top hospital			1
an investigation found that medics had been using a flawed procedure for scanning women who were at risk of losing their babies			1
it is feared that many will have been wrongly told they had miscarried and given drugs to terminate the pregnancy			1
near miss : @entity16 , 31 , was wrongly told by staff that her daughter @entity18 , now eight monhts old , right , had died when she was nine weeks pregnant			1
the ‘ fundamental error ’ in procedure goes back to 2006			0
midwives investigating miscarriages are recommended to use an internal transvaginal scan which is more accurate than the external @entity25 ultrasound procedure			2
the scandal came to light after @entity16 , 31 , was told she had miscarried at nine weeks following investigations at the @entity29 in @entity30			1
but when she attended a different hospital for treatment with drugs to remove the foetus in july 2012 , staff carried out a further scan which revealed a baby ’s heartbeat			1
miss @entity16 went on to give birth to a healthy baby but was ‘ traumatised ’ by the events			1
fears : in ms @entity16 's case the error was spotted , and she gave birth to a healthy baby			1
but an investigation has raised fears that other women may not have been so lucky @entity16 yesterday spoke of her despair after being told by a midwife she could not detect a heartbeat during her first scan			1
another midwife repeated the procedure at the @entity29 of @entity56 , in @entity30 , but concluded she had suffered a silent miscarriage			1
it was only when she went to @entity59 in @entity60 that another scan revealed she was still pregnant			0
miss @entity16 , of @entity62 , who is now mother to healthy eight - month - old @entity18 was left ‘ traumatised ’			2
she said : ‘ when i saw the baby clearly on the screen , i could n’t really believe that the @entity29 of @entity56 had got it wrong			1
i feel angry at the decision to not follow a simple process which could have prevented this misdiagnosis			0
’ miss @entity16 , who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome , added : ‘ it ’s just unbelievable that there are potentially other women out there who have been diagnosed with having a silent miscarriage			2
and they potentially have got rid of healthy babies – that frightens me			0
‘ maybe hundreds of babies have been lost because of their decision			2
’ the investigation found @entity29 staff were ‘ systematically failing ’ to perform the correct scans on women with suspected early pregnancy loss			1
a damning report from @entity85 , the @entity86 , says well - established clinical guidance was ignored for seven years			0
the findings will be ‘ extremely disturbing ’ for women who have had terminations in that time , he said			0
a spokesman for the @entity93 , who issued the guidelines , yesterday said almost every unit in @entity97 was signed up and adhering to the recommended procedure			0
mr @entity85 has asked the @entity99 to check that all health boards are now complying with the guidance			0
a helpline received 28 calls yesterday , of which eight women were ‘ immediately reassured ’			0
failings were discovered after a complaint by @entity109 ’s mother about her daughter ’s treatment			0
apology : @entity113 of @entity114 in @entity30 ( pictured ) have admitted they ' failed ' in their duty to ms @entity16 ' systematic failing ' : staff at the hospital had been using out - of - date guidelines for pregnancy scans , which led to false diagnoses the report found that @entity29 did not tell staff to carry out the internal scans			1
instead they relied on @entity25 scans that in @entity109 ’s case could have been ‘ potentially dangerous ’			0
even when the guidance was re-worded in 2011 to emphasise the need for tv scans in early miscarriage , the @entity29 policy went unchanged			2
mr @entity85 criticised the @entity30 and @entity132 for not updating its guidelines and told them to pay @entity109 £ 1,500 in compensation			2
mr @entity85 said : ‘ were it not for the fortunate circumstance of [ @entity109 ] seeking her post-miscarriage care at an alternative hospital , it seems likely that these failings would have resulted in the medical termination of a healthy , viable pregnancy			0
’ @entity93 spokesman @entity144 said : ‘ this is a really big issue because we have to be 100 per cent certain that a miscarriage has taken place – 97 per cent is no good for the 3 per cent of women for whom the wrong diagnosis would be a disaster			0
’ @entity30 and @entity132 said it made an ‘ unreserved apology ’ to @entity109 .			0

women at the @entity29 of @entity56 were given *botched* scans , which could have wrongly told them they had miscarried their babies
@entity16 , 31 , almost went through with an abortion , but a scan at a different hospital showed that her baby was alive and well
an investigation by the *ombudsman* of @entity56 found that the hospital had been using *outdated* guidelines when diagnosing miscarriages
it is now feared hundreds of women could have lost their babies
anyone who feels they may have been affected can call 0800 *952* 0244 between *9am* and *5pm* until monday .
