by @entity0 a domestic violence victim sexually exploited by a police officer on a 999 call was today suing a force for £ 25,000 over gross abuse of power claims			2
@entity8 @entity7 , 34 , was on duty and in uniform in @entity11 , south - east @entity12 , five years ago when he allegedly plied the ‘ vulnerable ’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her			1
he was convicted of criminal misconduct in 2010 and dismissed from the @entity17 - but the force does not accept responsibility for his actions , and the woman aged 37 is now suing them			1
in court : @entity8 @entity7 ( left , and right at his sentencing in 2010 ) , 34 , allegedly plied the ‘ vulnerable ’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her @entity26 , representing the claimant , said : ‘ the claimant accepts the account she gave to police shortly after these events			1
she stated she had asked @entity7 to kiss her			2
’ she added that @entity7 then asked the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , to perform a sex act on him and later texted her , saying : ‘ you were amazing			1
ca n't wait to see you again @entity37			2
’ the woman is now suing the @entity17 for compensation of up to £ 15,400 , plus a further £ 11,000 ‘ if it is found that the claimant did not have a capacity to consent to the sexual activity ’			1
she will be giving evidence about the september 2009 incident at @entity45 near @entity46 in front of the former officer , in a bid for compensation from the force			2
in her skeleton argument , miss @entity26 said : ‘ the complainant complains that @entity56 , for whom the defendant is vicariously liable , abused his position of trust as a police officer and the claimant was an intoxicated victim of domestic abuse			2
’ she added that he ‘ took advantage of her vulnerable state for his own sexual gratification in circumstances where he was in wilful neglect of his duty and was recklessly indifferent to the harm that was likely to be , and was , caused to the claimant as a result ’			2
lawsuit : @entity75 was convicted of criminal misconduct and dismissed from the @entity17 she said : ‘ @entity7 was charged by the defendant and convicted , by his own guilty plea , of misconduct in a public office in respect of events forming the basis of the claimant 's claim			1
‘ further he has been dismissed from the defendant 's force for gross misconduct and bringing the force into disrepute			1
' she felt confused and was trying to sort out in her head whether she had a right to be angry ' @entity26 , for the woman ‘ yet in these proceedings , the defendant seeks to deny that the officer 's conduct constitutes misfeasance and , in the alternative , denies that [ the force ] is vicariously liable for such conduct			1
’ miss @entity26 told the court that at first her client had not realised what had happened but that when she ‘ sobered up ’ she became ‘ increasingly concerned and distressed ’			0
she added : ‘ she was also blaming herself for what happened			0
initially she felt that because she had not said “ no ” , she had let it happen and this caused her to question whether it was her fault			0
‘ it had not sunk in at that stage how wrong it was for an officer to have acted in that way			2
she felt confused and was trying to sort out in her head whether she had a right to be angry			0
' @entity117 : @entity8 @entity7 , 34 , was on duty and in uniform in @entity11 , south - east @entity12 , five years ago when he allegedly plied the ‘ vulnerable ’ woman with drink and engaged in a sexual act with her miss @entity26 also submitted that following the incident her client had suffered a ‘ depressive and anxious adjustment disorder ’			1
she said that this fell within the range of £ 4,730 to £ 15,400 for damages			0
however , she added that if it was found that her client had not had capacity to consent , then a further sum should be awarded to reflect the assault , with a tariff of up to £ 11,000 available in respect of non-consensual penile penetration			0
miss @entity26 submitted that there are number of aggravating features that would mean she would not receive sufficient compensation if the awards were restricted to a basic award			0
she outlined these as being the ‘ significant degree of humiliation ’ suffered by her client , the fact that @entity56 's actions involved a grave breach of trust and a reckless disregard for the legality of his actions			1
it was added the claimant was ‘ especially vulnerable through her intoxication ’ and her recent experience of domestic violence			2
miss @entity26 said : ‘ the commissioner resists the claimant 's claim on misfeasance on the basis that sexual activity was consensual and consensual sexual activity was not in the performance - or purported performance - of the @entity168 's ( @entity56 's ) duties as an officer			1
hearing in 2010 : @entity75 was given a 20 - week sentence suspended for two years at @entity171 ( pictured )			0
he was also told to pay £ 1,000 costs and carry out 200 hours of unpaid work ‘ the claimant maintains that consent is something of a red herring in the context of this case			0
it is an essential part of the offence of misfeasance in a public office that the victim of the misfeasance has not [ consented ]			0
’ she added that an expert had concluded that the woman had not been ‘ capable ’ of consent at the time of the incident			0
the police claim no unlawful act took place because the woman had consented to the sexual act - and that the force is not liable for @entity200 ’s actions because he was on a ‘ mission of his own ’			1
@entity75 was given a 20 - week sentence suspended for two years at @entity171			0
he was also told to pay £ 1,000 costs and carry out 200 hours of unpaid work			0
a @entity17 spokesman told @entity208 before the hearing began today : ‘ the officer pleaded guilty at court and has been dismissed from the @entity17			1
‘ we are aware of a civil action being taken against the @entity17 , due to commence at @entity12 county court on march 24 [ today ]			1
