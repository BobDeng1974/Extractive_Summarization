’ ms @entity30 said @entity15 died on august 2009 having contracted the @entity32 virus the previous month , but by that time she was already severely ill - following the shaking more than two years beforehand			1
in april 2007 , when she was three and a half months old , she had sustained serious neurological injuries inflicted on her by her father , ms @entity30 said			1
these included injuries to the brain and eyes			2
‘ these injuries were so bad that they left @entity15 disabled with severely delayed development , functionally blind and suffering from seizures ( which ) the doctors found difficult to control			2
’ she could not sit up on her own , walk or clear secretions from her respiratory system ‘ which caused her to suffer from coughs , colds and pneumonia ’			0
@entity15 was aged two and a half when she died			2
@entity15 's mother : @entity50 , now 29 , had started her relationship with @entity5 in 2005 , and there was disharmony ms @entity30 added : ‘ it is clear , and accepted in the plea , that the shaking in 2007 was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death			1

he was tired and frustrated and had no intention to cause serious harm			0
the judge told @entity5 : ‘ like most babies , she cried			1
you picked her up and shook her four or five times			0
you may have been tired			0
you may have been uncertain as to how to placate @entity15			0
‘ you may have been cross with your partner			0
but none of that is any excuse whatsoever for your loss of temper and mistreatment of that baby			0
’ the judge said he acknowledged that @entity5 ’ actions had no intentional malice to the baby			1
he added : ‘ consequences matter and when the consequences become the more serious they can lead , as in your case , to more serious charges			0
’ he would make a reduction in the sentence for the fact that @entity5 had been prosecuted already for the same wrongful act			1
the judge said that if @entity5 had contested the present charge , he would have given him three years , but because of @entity5 ’s plea of guilty , he would reduce it to two			1
ms @entity30 had told the court that @entity15 ’s mother @entity50 , now 29 , had started her relationship with @entity5 in 2005 , and there was disharmony , with each adult enduring violence from the other			2
ms @entity50 had signed an agreement with social services that she would not leave her daughter on her own with @entity5			2
but she did not comply with this , including on the evening of the assault			2
she left the address where they were living in @entity113 , @entity9 , to go to bingo with a friend			2
@entity115 , defending , had told the court : ‘ we accept the defendant must return to prison			0

' where is the justice ? two years is n’t long enough , what will he serve , a year of that ? i would have preferred five years ' @entity50 , @entity15 ’s mother ms @entity50 said on leaving court : ‘ where is the justice ? two years is n’t long enough , what will he serve , a year of that ? i would have preferred five years			0
‘ at least then he would serve two and a half years - about the same time that @entity15 had to live			0
she ’s a child , babies cry			0
the only reason i left him that night was because i knew there was going to be @entity151 between us , i thought by going out it might defuse it			0
