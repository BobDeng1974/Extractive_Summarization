no wonder @entity2 ’s super-nimble hands are insured for a huge sum — for the fingers he uses to steal wallets are the tools of his trade			1
‘ you can pinch anything off anyone — apart from their shoes ! ’ he says			2
now he ’s exhibiting his ‘ skills ’ on stage in a one - man pickpocket show , called @entity16 , in which he even takes off someone ’s tie without them realising			1
he has also advised the @entity30 and taught the ‘ art ’ to actors — showing the boy who played the @entity33 in @entity35 ’s film @entity34 how to pick a pocket or two			2
@entity2 , 49 , describes himself as ‘ the only honest pickpocket you will ever meet ’			1
so i ask him to show me how those crooks we all fear go about their surreptitious trade			1
first , he says , they ‘ fan the mark ’			2
the ‘ mark ’ is the victim			2
so ‘ fanning ’ is using your hand with the fingers spread out to feel for valuables , usually using the back of the hand			2
‘ it ’s a light , fluttering motion and , if executed correctly , the victim is n’t aware of it , ’ says @entity2			1
@entity58 — and this is vitally important — distract your victim : pat them on the shoulder with one hand as you ask the time and use your other hand to lift their wallet			2
or just look into their eyes , so their peripheral vision does n’t see your hand darting into their pocket			2
the wallet : @entity24 is now without his cash and cred cards thanks to @entity2 's nimble fingers the phone : daylight robbery and @entity79 does n't even feel a thing or — a much more simple ruse — ‘ accidentally ’ bump into them			1
‘ a classic trick is to pretend you are helping them			2
for example , carry a sachet of mayonnaise or ketchup , put a pin in it and squirt it at someone from a distance			2
go up to them and start cleaning up their jacket			2
while you ’re doing it , pick their pocket			2
’ to describe his activities , @entity2 uses old - fashioned pickpocket patter , much of which dates back to 18th - century thieves			1
‘ poke ’ is slang for a wallet			2
‘ skinning the poke ’ means stealing one , taking out the money and throwing away the empty wallet			0
the easiest target is one who has their wallet ( or phone ) in the most vulnerable place : the back trouser pocket			0
@entity2 uses two fingers in a pincer - like movement to steal it			1
his favourite ploy is to strike as the victim walks away from him — because they are less likely to feel a hand in their pocket while they are moving			0
@entity128 business : @entity2 shows how a folded newspaper can be used to steal a pair of sunglasses @entity2 shows how to remove a pair of expensive sunglasses hanging from a jacket breast pocket by flicking them out and catching them with a folded newspaper			1
when he does it to me , i do n’t feel a thing			0
crucially , he ensures he does n’t ‘ tip the bit ’ — that is , draw attention to the pickpocketing action			0
he thought he ’d tipped the bit when he stole the pen from my pocket and it made a clicking noise			0
needless to say , i did n’t notice			0
not surprisingly , the most difficult target is a watch			0
i challenge him to remove mine without me noticing			0
it is tightly held on my wrist with a leather strap			0
it is n’t just buckled , but it also goes through a tight retaining loop			0
fixing my gaze , @entity2 puts his hand lightly on top of my watch , unbuckles it and whisks it away			1
i do n’t feel anything in the entire operation and do n’t look down because our eyes are firmly locked			0
more oddly , i do n’t notice the watch ’s absence once removed			0
‘ people have a muscle memory , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ they do n’t notice if something ’s gone , however heavy it is , whether it ’s a handkerchief — or your notebook			0
’ with that , he hands me back my hefty notebook , which i thought had been securely tucked inside my breast pocket			0
somehow , he ’d removed it			0
for all his skill as a pickpocket , @entity2 says he has never used it for anything other for entertainment			1
’ however , he admits one exception : he once saw a woman being pickpocketed outside @entity187 , decided to pickpocket the pickpocket and gave the purse back to the victim			1
proudly , @entity2 says the smartly dressed thief — who realised too late what had happened — went up to him afterwards and said : ‘ nice work			1
’ @entity2 first became interested in pickpocketing as a child when he was mugged			1
‘ they took my pocket money and beat me up , ’ he says			0
not long after , he saw a theatrical pickpocket on tv — and then saw his father being pickpocketed on a trip to @entity201			1
he now uses his skills to expose quite how vulnerable we all are to the growing number of pickpockets on our streets			0
apparently , @entity207 and @entity208 are the most dangerous places for pickpockets in @entity211 ; @entity212 is listed tenth			0
as we walk down @entity212 ’s @entity214 , he points out some easy prey : a woman sitting on a bench with an open bag next to her and a man with an unzipped pocket , a phone clearly visible inside it			1
daylight robbery : the pickpocket specialist offers @entity24 directions while slipping a hand inside his pocket distraction : as @entity24 looks into the distance , his mobile phone has been stolen and is about to disappear into @entity2 's pocket he can identify the model of a phone by the shape of the bulge in your pocket			1
@entity244 , ’ he says as we pass people whose phones , inside their pockets , are invisible to me			1
once , pickpockets concentrated on loose change and handkerchiefs , but now mobile phones account for half of pickpocketing crimes			0
@entity2 says : ‘ if i stopped everyone and told them how vulnerable they are , i ’d never have any time left to do anything else			1
’ mobile phones are the perfect item for pickpockets — ‘ it ’s called @entity260 or @entity262 picking ’ — but the information about the owner contained on the sim card is more useful to the thief than the phone ’s intrinsic value because it contains a wealth of personal information and possibly even bank details			1
these days , with clever software , criminals do n’t even have to steal the phone			0
they can ‘ skim ’ it — place their own phone over it and copy all your data			0
pickpockets carefully look for the moment you use your phone			0
they ’ll watch to see which pocket you put it back in — and pounce			0
ironically , a favourite spot is near signs that say : ‘ @entity288			0
’ according to @entity2 : ‘ when we see such signs , we instinctively pat our pockets to check our valuables are ok			1
and the pickpocket is watching to see where the item is kept			1
’ after spending time with this cunning man , i ca n’t help keep patting my pockets obsessively as i walk along the street			1
i hope a real pickpocket — rather than a master showman — is n’t watching me			1
@entity301 is at the @entity302 , @entity303 , until april 27 .			0
