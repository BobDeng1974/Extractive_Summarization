click here to read @entity2 's match report on heartbreak for @entity4 at the @entity5 two or three minutes before the end of this game – shortly before @entity9 's hammer blow put @entity4 on the seat of their pants – their midfielder @entity13 crumpled to the ground with what appeared to be cramp in both calves			1
it did n't last long but it was telling			0
the @entity19 had , after all , spent most of the night doing his own job and a fair share of the bloke 's who was playing next to him			0
the case of @entity26 and @entity4 is certainly a curious one			1
one of the @entity33 champions ' success stories , the @entity29 's standing at the @entity30 is nevertheless not quite what it was			1
@entity26 appeared to neglect his defensive responsibilities during @entity4 's 1 - 0 loss to @entity37 @entity13 ( @entity38 ) was left exhausted and out of position as he tried to cover for his midfield partner @entity26 , at the age of 31 , remains a formidable footballer			1
at full tilt at the front of one of @entity4 's rapier breaks from their own half , he can be imperious , almost unstoppable and as destructive as a lorry with its brake cables cut			1
nevertheless , football is about more than scoring and creating goals			0
even teams as blessed as @entity4 have to defend , even @entity54 's most gilded teams have to do their work without the ball			2
they have to have the appetite , the mobility and the lung capacity			0
to look at @entity26 these days is to wonder about that part of the deal			2
when @entity4 do not have the ball , he can look laboured and slow to anticipate			2
turning towards the opposition goal does n't seem to be a problem whereas turning towards his own certainly does			0
it would be wrong to question his desire			0
@entity26 appeared to struggle against small , nimble footed players like @entity37 's @entity70 former @entity72 midfielder @entity71 beats the @entity29 to the ball in a 50 - 50 challenge at the @entity5 certainly he made an ass of himself in the summer with his self - indulgent moans about birthday cakes ( the lack of ) and a supposed ( for that read ' imagined ' ) lack of sympathy shown him by the club following the passing of his brother			1
nevertheless , he remains a footballer committed to his role			0
what is troubling is whether @entity26 can physically meet the challenge these days when @entity4 are forced deep in to their own half , confronted by intelligent , energetic footballers that come at you in numbers at places like the @entity5 and , closer to him , @entity97 and @entity98			1
@entity26 was playing at the @entity30 last season when @entity100 swarmed all over the @entity4 midfield on their way to a victory in the @entity33			1
he looked lost that day and once again here last night he looked in trouble again , particularly in the first half			0
@entity26 is left on the floor as @entity107 takes the ball from him during @entity4 's heartbreaking loss former @entity4 defender @entity9 celebrates after scoring a dramatic late winner @entity111 is comforted by @entity9 after managing to keep @entity37 at bay until the bitter end without @entity114 and @entity115 in their starting eleven last night , @entity37 played rather differently			1
their threat during an opening half hour they dominated came centrally via the nimble work of @entity121 , @entity71 and @entity122			0
at this time @entity13 badly needed @entity26 alongside him to track the runners and shield their central defenders from the red shirts			1
too often , @entity26 was slightly out of position or too slow to read the play			2
we are talking half a yard or a split second but , at this level and against these players , that is sometimes the difference between a goal and an attack snuffed out at source			0
as the game wore on , @entity26 did improve			1
he was not even his team 's worst player			0
twice towards half - time , @entity26 turned defence in to marauding attack with a sharp turn and a trundle upfield that allow @entity4 to impose their own attacking patterns on a @entity37 defence that did not always look terrible secure			1
@entity26 is under even greater scrutiny after a summer punctuated by some ill - advised comments @entity151 must help @entity4 recover before their next game against @entity33 leaders @entity100 ultimately , though , @entity26 had questions asked of him on wednesday night that he couldn ' t always answer and his coach @entity155 will have noticed			1
@entity26 has faced these questions before			2
he faced them last season and answered them metaphorically and literally			0
' i hear what people say and i prove them wrong , ' he said at a press conference earlier this year			0
as he gets older and the @entity4 squad grows ever deeper , however , @entity26 will perhaps come under greater scrutiny			1
@entity155 bought another central midfielder – the @entity19 @entity165 – in the summer and it is tempting to wonder if he would have played last night had injury not intervened			2
there are always other roles for @entity26 , of course			2
he can be a devastating second striker , for example			0
@entity13 certainly may not miss him in his current role .			0
