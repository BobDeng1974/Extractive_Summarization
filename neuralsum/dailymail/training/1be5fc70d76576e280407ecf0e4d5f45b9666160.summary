if you thought your commute to work this morning was bad , take a look at the journey these children have to make each day to school			0
from riding a zip wire over the @entity8 in @entity9 to clinging to the remains of a collapsed rope bridge in @entity12 , students have to be wide awake to navigate these precarious routes			2
the @entity38 village 's school is located halfway up the mountain and is the most remote in the world rocky road : it takes @entity44 and his grandfather five hours to climb from the base of the mountain to the @entity49 primary school			2
children must travel along a path that is just a couple of feet wide in some parts and has a sheer drop on one side down into the canyon below determined : students in @entity12 cling to steel bars on a broken bridge as they cross @entity59 near their village in @entity61			1
a pillar supporting one side of the crossing collapsed , leaving the wooden planks that acted as a path tilted to one side mind the gap : a group of girls walk across a narrow plank on the walls of the 16th century @entity74 fort to reach their school in @entity76 do n't look down ! for most people , a zip wire is a novel thrill but for these villagers , it 's part of their daily commute across the @entity8 river in @entity9 taking the shortcut : for the handful of families living in the area 40 miles southeast of @entity9 's capital @entity89 , the wire is their only access to the outside world			1
it is 1,300ft above the @entity8 and whizzes travellers across the river at 40mph to the opposite bank , half a mile away clinging on for dear life : these two brave young boys have to use a tyre as a makeshift raft to travel to school along a river in @entity102 in the @entity103 children living in the @entity106 village , deep in the mountains in @entity35 's @entity108 , have to climb unsecured ladders that are leaning against a 60 - metre tall cliff face each day to get to school			1
the ladders are made by villagers and have to be replaced every three to five years			0
the alternative is a four - hour cross-country detour close to collapse : this bridge on the island of @entity118 was destroyed by heavy rain			0
the determined pupils from the @entity122 village who cross it every day then have to walk a further seven miles through dense forest to their school in the town of @entity128 these students from @entity131 village had to construct a bamboo raft to get to school after a bridge across the @entity59 river in @entity12 's @entity61 collapsed maximum capacity : a single horse cart ferries more than thirty - five children to school on the outskirts of @entity141 in @entity142 battling through a blizzard : a villager and her daughter attempt to cross a broken wooden bridge covered in snow in @entity34 , @entity35			1
the bridge is the only connection to the outside world for people living in the @entity153 village			0

villagers living in a remote region near @entity9 's capital @entity89 cross the @entity8 river on a zip wire
young boys in the @entity103 have to use tyres as makeshift rafts on their daily commute in @entity102
