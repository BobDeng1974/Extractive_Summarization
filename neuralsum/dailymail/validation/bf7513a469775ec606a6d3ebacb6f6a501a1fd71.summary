the warning from @entity1 after saturday ’s demolition job in the @entity3 was that @entity4 will build on their momentum and arrive at the @entity6 with even sharper teeth			1
after opening with defeat by @entity9 , @entity4 won all of their remaining @entity12 fixtures			1
in the end , they were left to rue a late breakaway try from @entity16 ’s @entity15 that , according to @entity17 , represented a title - defining 14 - point swing			1
@entity4 ' @entity20 scores a try during the @entity12 demolition of @entity16 in the 61 - 20 victory on saturday @entity20 yells in delight having scored a second - half try for @entity4 as @entity17 's side ran riot @entity1 was left to ponder the ‘ what ifs ’ in the underground concourses of the @entity29 , though the defence coach believes @entity4 will be a significant force when they re-group for summer training camps in @entity35 and @entity36			1
‘ we ’ll be on an even higher plateau by the @entity6 , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity39 is the only time that we compete on an equal level to the southern hemisphere teams			0
they are together for four months every year and we like to think we get better with time together			0
there are no guarantees but i do n’t think we ’ll be a bad team come the @entity6			1
’ the extensive preparations will involve another meeting with @entity16 for a warm - up match at the @entity48			1
@entity4 ' defence coach @entity1 believes the team will be even better by the @entity6 the victorious @entity4 players applaud the travelling fans at the @entity29 in @entity3 confidence will be high after the imperious second - half display in @entity3 — scoring 47 points in 26 minutes — but focus will be on how to shake off their habit of starting campaigns slowly			1
with most of the squad playing slow - paced regional rugby , fitness levels have been identified as one of the keys to the problem			0
@entity17 will push his side to their limits and centre @entity68 believes they will be even stronger than the @entity72 side that reached the @entity73 semi-final in @entity75			2
‘ we are definitely better than we were four years ago , ’ said @entity68			1
‘ the core of players are still together and there ’s a lot more experience			0
‘ we know when we get together for a long period of time we are a bloody good team			0
i think it showed against @entity9 that we were a bit rusty when we have just two weeks prep together			2
the lucky @entity4 fans who made the trip to the @entity29 were treated to a masterclass of rugby @entity68 ( centre ) opened the try account for @entity4 early in the first - half on saturday ‘ looking back to the last @entity6 , we had more time together and really worked in putting in the hard yards in terms of fitness and technical play			1
that preparation period gives us scope to work on things and improve our conditioning			0
‘ the warm - up games will be a good measuring stick of where we are			0
touch wood , the last few months of the season are injury - free for everyone			0
’ based on the defensive display against @entity109 and the attacking swagger against @entity16 , @entity4 have a powerful formula for success			1
they broke away from their tight structure on saturday and played with flair and panache that have been in short supply			0
@entity16 capitulated under the speed and intensity , with the @entity16 media calling for coach @entity121 ’s head after his side were left chasing shadows			1
@entity17 's men are confident that they can improve ahead of the @entity6 @entity125 crosses over for @entity17 's side as he managed a sensational second half try hat - trick in @entity3 ‘ we always thought we were capable of an attacking performance like that , ’ said @entity4 skipper @entity20			1
‘ to be fair to @entity17 , @entity131 and the coaches they tell us to play			0
‘ over the last few years maybe it was just a confidence issue but we are a lot more confident than we were 24 months ago			1
’ for the sake of entertainment value it raises the question of whether bonus points should be introduced to incentivise attacking play			0
@entity1 , however , feels there is no need to change the format			2
‘ i ’m not interested in try bonus points or anything like that , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ it ’s been one of the best @entity12 in memory			2
‘ when was the last time three teams had the chance to win it in three separate matches ? it ’s a great advert for the competition			2
‘ the defence control what the attack does			0
if the defence is not very good , you can attack like that			0
do you think you could play that kind of rugby against @entity163 ? if we threw the ball around like that we would lose by 20 points			0
‘ we ’ve taken some positive steps and we ’re regretting that bad 40 minutes against @entity9 but four wins out of five has been a very good effort for us			2

@entity4 beat @entity16 to end their @entity12 campaign on a high note
after defeat by @entity9 , @entity4 won all of their remaining matches
defence coach @entity1 is confident @entity4 will be even better by the time the @entity6 comes around
@entity68 thinks @entity4 are better than four years ago
