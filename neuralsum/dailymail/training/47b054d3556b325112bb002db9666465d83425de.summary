no one should under - estimate the marketing power of the internet			0
but , as @entity4 has found to its cost , it does n’t do to underestimate its users – and their sense of humour – either			1
the store giant tried to harness the influence of @entity11 by launching a promotional campaign asking for people to finish the sentence ‘ i shop at @entity4 because … ’ @entity17 error : @entity4 is trying to shed its reputation for being just for the rich but a @entity11 campaign led to a string of tweets lampooning them whoops : the supermarket asked a question online but may not have liked the answers clearly bosses had hoped to see positive tweets spread far and wide across the globe			1
but instead the chain – which has a @entity30 – found itself the subject of ridicule for its upmarket image and largely middle - class patronage			0
derogatory tweets , accompanied with the hashtag # @entity36 , included one from a user who joked that she favoured the store because she ‘ did n’t like being surrounded by poor people ’			1
answer : this response was one of many that spread online in response the @entity4 's campaign this week another spoof reply said : ‘ i shop at @entity4 because darling , @entity49 is just too much of a trek mid-week ’			1
while a number of replies did genuinely praise the store , which is part of the @entity58 , many of the tweets poked fun at the store ’s perceived ‘ wealthy ’ shopper			2
the comments have become a huge internet draw – and left commentators divided over whether the campaign has been a pr disaster or triumph			2
celebrity endorsements : @entity4 is a favourite haunt for the famous , including @entity71 , left , and @entity72 , right - while @entity69 has also been spotted in its aisles good reputation : @entity4 is well known for its quality produce but some of its ranges are more expensive @entity4 is renowned for its quality produce and exclusive food ranges by celebrity chefs such as @entity81			1
it bolstered its royal credentials in 2009 when it was involved in an investment deal with prince @entity85 ’s @entity84 food company			2
it is not the first @entity11 promotional stunt to backfire			1
tweet @entity89 not all bad : some answered the question with genuine reasons for loving @entity4 earlier this year , @entity94 urged people to tell their tales about the fastfood chain using the hashtag # @entity98			1
customers replied telling horror stories about their experiences in the restaurants			2
despite the @entity4 ridicule , some argued the campaign had been a success			1
one observer said : ‘ no such thing as bad publicity ! ’ the supermarket took a similar view			0
a spokesman added : ‘ we like to hear what people think			0
we ’ve thanked everyone for the genuine and funny tweets			0
’ @entity4 may have had an uncomfortable few days following a @entity17 campaign online that went sour but it is not the first big player to be burned in this way			1
many other businesses have tried to whip up interest on @entity11 only for it to blow up in their faces , while others initiatives have just been plain poorly judged or in bad taste			1
in 2009 the @entity128 wanted to show how techno - savvy it was by allowing tweets about the budget to appear on its website automatically using a @entity133			0
if someone used the hashtag # budget it would pop up on telegraph.co.uk but it was quickly hijacked by those who used it to make jokes at the paper 's expense ( pictured right ) some choice comments included : ' even the @entity143 is better than this drivel '			1
@entity94 also wanted to boost its profile online by using the hashtag # @entity98 to ask people to regale stories of their hard - working staff - but it did n't go at all to plan			1
tweeters came straight back with their horror stories at restaurants , claiming they were given food poisoning , and that one burger contained a finger nail			0
search engine giant @entity156 also courted controversy when it pledged to donate to charity following a devastating @entity160 earthquake in a stunt they believed would also boost their profile online			0
their staff tweeted : ' how you can # @entity165 – for every retweet , @ bing will give $ 1 to @entity160 quake victims , up to $ 100k '			2
but instead all it got was a barrage of abuse from people convinced it was in poor taste			0
only this year coffee giant @entity176 put its foot in it on @entity11			2
they were forced to issue an apology after it managed to upset people in @entity182			0
it ' erroneously posted ' a tweet which encouraged followers on there to ' show us what makes you proud to be @entity190 ' - and outraged replies followed			0
and sometimes companies get it completely and utterly wrong			0
condom giant @entity194 decided to run a pr campaign with the hashtag # @entity196			1
in utterly disastrous fashion it decided to start the ball rolling with this joke to its @entity202 followers - ' why did @entity203 give men penises ? so they ’d have at least one way to shut a woman up			0
it went very badly for them from there .			0

supermarket asks @entity11 why people go there using the hashtag # @entity36 but got some answers it will not have liked
*majority* of people who replied concentrated on its posh reputation and only a minority gave serious answers
' i shop at @entity4 because @entity228 ’s pony just will not *eat* @entity230 straw , ' one said
another said : ' i shop at @entity4 because the toilet paper is made from 24ct gold thread '
@entity4 's pr team tweeted back that they *enjoyed* ' most of them '
