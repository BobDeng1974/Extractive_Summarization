@entity0 wants to see some of his @entity2 stars line up for the under - 21s in next summer 's @entity4			1
providing they get through a two - legged play - off against @entity8 , @entity6 's @entity5 will take part in the eight - team tournament in the @entity11 next june			1
the last time @entity2 qualified , an under - strength squad failed to get out of the group stage after losing all three of their games			0
they did not score once from open play			0
@entity0 celebrates @entity2 's win over @entity19 earlier this month @entity20 was in charge of the @entity23 team at the last @entity25 championships @entity26 was part of the @entity23 team that crashed out of the last @entity25 championships @entity29 ( not pictured ) scores for @entity30 against @entity2 at the last @entity25 championships this time @entity0 wants to make the players in his senior squad who are eligible for the under - 21s available to @entity6 to boost his chances of winning the tournament			1
the @entity2 manager said : ' i am certain there will be players ( there ) who will have made a ( senior ) appearance or will have been with us			0
' we are going to say - " look , just because you have been with us for a while that does n't make you a 100 % bona fide senior that never plays anywhere else			0
it just makes you an @entity2 player and we are going to use you where we think best "			0
' @entity0 's view , which is shared by director of elite development @entity53 , is that exposure to tournament football is vital for any @entity2 player , regardless of their age or talent			1
@entity61 ( right ) is one of the senior @entity2 players who could still play for the @entity23 @entity63 and @entity64 ( right ) have recently been called up to the @entity2 squad @entity66 ( centre ) shoots for goal against @entity69 during the @entity70 in @entity71 it has not gone unnoticed that five members of the @entity75 team that beat @entity76 in the @entity70 final defeated @entity2 's under - 21s in the @entity4 final six years ago			1
there are a host of players in the senior squad that @entity6 could choose			2
@entity61 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity86 are all eligible			1
after dropping just two points in their qualification campaign , @entity6 is reluctant to draft in any top stars from the senior side though			2
the fact that @entity2 's seniors play a qualifier in @entity94 three days before the under - 21s championship starts would disrupt preparations for the @entity5 too			2
but should the under - 21s come through their october play - off , @entity0 will try to persuade @entity6 to consider selecting some players who already have represented the senior side for the finals			1
@entity102 and @entity103 ( right ) were part of the @entity75 team that beat @entity23 six years ago teenager @entity86 is still young enough to play for @entity2 if they qualify for the @entity105 @entity0 wants the likes of @entity85 ( right ) to get more tournament experience ' that 's what the @entity109 would like to happen , ' @entity0 said			1
' it will just be a question of @entity6 and i sitting down and deciding which ones are the right ones to send			0
' there is always going to be a risk that he and i decide that although this player could have done both we are not going to ask him to because he already has tournament experience , for example , or we think it 's a bit unfair he has not been anywhere near the other ones and all of a sudden he jumps in			1
' but it will be a real discussion point between @entity6 and i and we get on very well in that respect			0
we both sing off the same hymn sheet			0
' @entity0 appears open to the idea of allowing the likes of @entity85 , @entity61 and @entity66 to compete in the tournament			1
when asked whether selection of senior players for the under - 21s should be restricted to those who do not play regular first - team football for their clubs , @entity0 replied : ' no. i am not putting any riders on it at all at the moment			1
' @entity0 put his faith in youth on monday night and it paid off as @entity2 's inexperienced xi recorded an impressive 2 - 0 win in @entity19 , in a @entity144 qualifier			2
@entity145 impressed on his @entity2 debut against @entity147 on september 21 @entity63 started for @entity2 against @entity148 and @entity19 but made ' technical errors ' in the latter @entity145 impressed on his full debut and although 20 - year - old @entity152 was guilty of committing ' technical errors ' , according to @entity0 , he looked relatively comfortable in his first competitive start too			0
@entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 all earned their first call - ups as @entity0 looked to draw a line under the winless @entity70 campaign with a fresh - looking squad			0
after beating @entity19 , @entity2 's biggest qualification rivals , in such impressive fashion , @entity0 was glad he decided against turning to older , more experienced players like @entity166 and @entity167 , whose international careers now look to be over			2
' it was a case of me holding my nerve , ' @entity0 said			0
' i 've tried to force myself to keep looking two years ahead			0

@entity0 keen to give players more tournament experience
likes of @entity61 and @entity85 could play for @entity177
@entity6 's side must beat @entity8 to reach @entity105 which take place next june
