by joining the club which spawned @entity2 , @entity0 ensured one thing			1
his old nickname was never likely to gain much traction			1
‘ i ’ve managed to escape from the ‘ @entity10 ’ tag , which i ’m quite glad of , ’ said @entity7 ’s £ 3million summer signing			1
‘ it was a little bit strange and came about just because i ’m small and left - footed			1
that ’s the comparison and it was made only after about four or five games for @entity15			1
four games , five at most			1
at the age of 11 he was one of the kids who flooded onto the @entity33 pitch at the end of a pre-season friendly with @entity36			1
he claimed @entity38 ’s autograph and hung it on his bedroom wall			2
within weeks of being handed a first - team debut for @entity15 at the age of 17 his own scrawl became coveted			1
not since @entity44 dragged his stick thin frame through the early rounds of @entity47 in 2005 had a young @entity48 been burdened with a level of expectation to match it			2
@entity53 thin , modest and unassuming @entity17 football ’s great white hope – less white than he used to be after a couple of months in @entity55 – was brought up in @entity56			2
he remains well - spoken , grounded and remarkably normal for an 18 - year - old almost submerged by the tsunami of speculation and headlines last season			1
‘ i ’m really glad that i ’m away from the hype which surrounded me , ’ he conceded after signing a raft of autographs and posing for selfies with @entity66 performance school kids in @entity20 on wednesday			2
@entity0 was called up by @entity68 for @entity69 qualifying double header against @entity71 and @entity72 ‘ i ’d only played just a few games for @entity15 when there were rumours and stories about other clubs being interested			1
it did n’t really affect me but it was beyond belief it was happening after just a couple of games			2
‘ to be over in @entity55 now and starting again is really good for me			2
the main reason i chose to go abroad was the style of football is something i ’ve always really liked			2
i also wanted to learn another language and see how things are done elsewhere			2
’ no one knows him as @entity10 in @entity90			2
at @entity7 they have a tradition of breeding precociously talented young players			1
a £ 3m fee was big news here , but less so in the @entity55 capital			1
@entity0 is part of the club ’s @entity99 squad , but has yet to play a game for the first team			1
his early weeks have been spent acclimatising to living abroad , alone , in his own flat			2
satellite television and a wifi connection are all a young man needs to stay connected with home these days but homesickness has been unavoidable at times			2
‘ it did take me a wee bit of time to settle in , but i really like it now , ’ he told @entity112			2
‘ most of the team can speak @entity115 which is good for me			1
i just try to fill my time learning new things and every day after training i have my @entity55 lessons which helps too			2
@entity0 joined @entity55 club @entity7 from @entity15 this summer for £ 3million ‘ i try and keep myself occupied			1
to begin with i missed family and friends , but now i ’ve been there a few months i ’m dealing with it fine			0
‘ i knew before i signed that i ’d miss everyone but i also knew that i could deal with it long - term			1
’ for @entity17 teenagers the horizons rarely spin any further than the @entity126			0
@entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 watched him , but his height – or lack of it – put @entity115 clubs off			0
physically slight , if durable and resilient to tough challenges , @entity0 was also tracked by @entity134 and @entity135 and made up his mind at an early stage to go abroad			1
asked what the biggest cultural shock has been he responded : ‘ the intensity of training			0
that ’s been a big difference			0
‘ in @entity68 you get a lot of time off - but in @entity55 there are less days off			1
‘ i do notice that physically i ’m a lot sharper and the individual programs have brought me on			0
‘ the training at @entity15 was great - but training at @entity7 is a lot more demanding and no - one gets away with not giving 100 per cent every session			1
’ @entity156 's @entity155 impressed @entity157 after training with the senior @entity68 side in a nation where young players fall into the trap of believing their own hype , @entity0 knew there were grounds for improvement			1
towards the end at @entity15 his form dipped			0
‘ i knew i was n’t playing as well as i could , ’ he said			0
‘ i like to set high standards for myself so i tried different ways to address why it just would n’t click for me as it had done at the start of the season			0
‘ but then i realised i ’m still young and maybe that ’s just something that ’s going to happen , a dip in form			0
‘ i tried to do work in the gym on the physical side of things to try and help me counteract what i was coming up against			0
i also looked at whether it was a tactical or mental thing			0
‘ i came to the conclusion that i was getting man - marked more , so that was down to the tactical side learning how to deal with it			1
there was the physical side as well , so there were a few reasons i found			0
‘ i ’m still addressing some of them			0
i ’m doing a lot of work and as far as international football goes , the physical side is really important			0
so i still need to improve on that			0
’ he ’s not the finished article yet and admits it			0
still , @entity157 asked him along for the double header with @entity71 and @entity72 to form an opinion of just how close he is			1
@entity0 in action for @entity68 's under 19 team before being called up to the senior side left - back @entity155 , @entity0 ’s former @entity33 teammate , is playing first team football in the @entity203 with @entity156 and looks destined to spend the next 10 years as @entity68 ’s left - back			1
@entity0 ’s inclusion in either of the two games coming up would be a surprise			1
yet , he insisted : ‘ if i ’m picked i ’ll be ready			0
we ’ve prepared the whole week for this			0
‘ i ’ve dreamed about a @entity68 call - up for a long time so i feel that i ’m ready			1
‘ at the end of the day you do n’t know when a chance like this will come for you again so you have to make the most of it			0
‘ all the senior players have been brilliant with me this week			0
someone like @entity220 has played at the highest level , @entity217 has played in the @entity99 too			1
it ’s great to have players like them around			0
’ he expected a bit of ribbing			0
some ‘ @entity228 ’ chat has been spared so far			0
‘ no - one in the @entity68 squad has said anything about it yet - which i ’m quite glad about , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i thought something might have been said			0
there ’s been no initiation ceremony yet either			0
i ’ve not had to sing a song or anything like that			0
i would n’t look forward to that			0
