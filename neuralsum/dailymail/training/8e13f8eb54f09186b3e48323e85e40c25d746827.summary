during and interview with @entity21 , the 28 - year - old twins , who are busy celebrating the tenth anniversary of their globally - successful label @entity19 , admitted that , despite their incredible success as designers , their initial transition from film to fashion was not without its difficulties			1
' people were asking us all sorts of questions in the beginning , ' @entity0 , who is the younger of the pair by just two minutes , said			0
' [ but ] you just have to put on blinders and do your work			0
' despite any initial doubt they faced from fashion 's elite at the start of their careers , the pair have long since proven their abilities both as designers and as businesswomen , and have happily left their once - successful acting careers behind them			1
the twins , who first rose to fame in 1987 at the age of six months when they shared the role of young @entity63 in hit sitcom @entity64 , were named as the @entity67 's @entity66 in june , having scooped the title of @entity69 in 2012			1

what began with a mission to create the perfect white t - shirt , the first item to go on sale under the label 's name , is now a global fashion sensation , with the brand turning over tens of millions of dollars in sales each year			1

the label was inspired by their older brother @entity115 , 30 , who goes by his middle name @entity123 , and younger sister @entity114 , 25 , who is currently carving out a career for herself as a successful film actress			2
while it operates on a slightly smaller scale than its sister line @entity19 , it too has expanded beyond the girls ' initial expectations and recently spawned its own signature scents , @entity114 and @entity132 and @entity133			1
the twins continue to oversee every detail of the day - to - day running of each label , including the venues for their fashion shows , the locations of their stores and the design of every product			1

' we sit and look at everything in every possible version of how you might wear it			0
