by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:31 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 27 november 2012 foreign office minister @entity2 breached the @entity3 by failing to declare income from renting out a flat @entity5 minister @entity2 was today censured by @entity7 ’s standards watchdog for failing to declare income from renting out a flat			1
a complaint against the senior @entity11 minister was upheld by the @entity12 , @entity13 , for receiving thousands of pounds from tenants in her @entity16 flat			1
after being made a minister in may 2010 , she moved out of the flat on security advice but could not sell it because of a dramatic fall in house prices			1
some £ 30,000 had been wiped off the property ’s value			2
instead @entity2 , who was @entity5 co-chairman at the time , rented the flat out			2
she received £ 6,937 in rent during 2010 - 11 and less than £ 5,000 in 2011 - 12			1
as minister without portolio she told the @entity29 about the flat , but did not notify the @entity3 authorities where the income should have been recorded on the register of interests because it was more than the £ 5,000 - a - year threshold			1
in evidence to mr @entity13 , she blamed ‘ an oversight , for which i take full responsibility ’			0
in today ’s ruling , the commissioner said : ‘ @entity2 was not engaged in any comprehensive scheme to obscure her property interests and it should be noted that her failure to register her rental income did not result in any financial loss to the taxpayer , or additional monetary gain to herself			1
‘ nevertheless , the @entity48 seeks to promote openness and accountability and the absence of monetary gain does not absolve members of the requirement properly to register relevant interests			2
’ the peer has apologised and the matter is now regarded as closed , said the @entity57 in a report			0
@entity2 said : ‘ throughout this process , i have endeavoured to ensure that relevant authorities have been notified at all times			2
the fact that i owned , and was letting out , the flat was known to @entity29 , the @entity64 , and @entity65			0
as soon as i became aware that the flat was not included on the @entity67 , i immediately informed the registrar			0
‘ i would sincerely like to apologise for any failure to disclose my personal interests in accordance with the rules of the @entity3			0
’ mr @entity13 cleared @entity2 of a more serious allegation that she improperly claimed overnight subsistence allowance while staying in the spare room of a flat in @entity77 , west @entity78 , which was being rented by @entity5 official @entity79			2
@entity2 referred herself to the commissioner over the allegation , which relates to a six - month period in 2007 - 08 after she was made a peer and was waiting to move into the @entity16 property			1
at the time , peers were allowed to claim £ 165.50 a night for the cost of staying in @entity78 to attend the @entity3			0
@entity2 told mr @entity13 that she spent part of that time staying in hotels but also spent around 12 nights at the @entity77 flat and paid an ‘ appropriate ’ amount of £ 1,200 to mr @entity79			1
in today 's report , mr @entity13 said he had interviewed both mr @entity79 and the property 's owner @entity91 , and concluded : ‘ there is an arguable case that she was entitled to claim a night subsistence allowance towards the cost of maintaining a residence in @entity78 from the point where she took on contractual liability for her flat in @entity16 and incurred financial costs by reason of paying a deposit			0
‘ she has also put forward evidence of expenditure in relation to her interim accommodation arrangements , even if some of that expenditure might not always be viewed as necessarily incurred			0
in any event , i can not be satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that she breached the @entity48			0

@entity12 upheld complaint against senior @entity11 minister
@entity2 received £ 6,937 in 2010 - 11 and up to £ 5,000 in 2011 - 12 but failed to declare in the register of interests
