a couple who had been trying for a baby for almost a decade are celebrating the birth of quadruplet girls following a pregnancy that made medical history			1
doctors were stunned when four babies of the same sex developed after a single embryo was implanted in the pair ’s first attempt at @entity12			1
and after nine years of longing to start a family , proud parents @entity13 and @entity15 suddenly have a rather substantial one			1
@entity13 and @entity15 tried for a baby unsuccessfully for nine years before having quads @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 after @entity12 treatment a single fertilised embryo was implanted - so doctors were stunned when four babies developed , and medics said it was unheard of for four children of the same sex to be born from a single embryo the babies are now seven weeks old , doing well in hospital and likely to be allowed to go home next month , when the whirlwind of sleepless nights and feeding will kick in			1
dr @entity40 , director of the @entity41 , told @entity42 that if the babies are all from the same @entity12 embryo then they will all be identical			2
she explained that if they are not identical then some of the babies must have been conceived naturally within a few days of the @entity12 embryo being implanted			1
she believes that the presence of two placentas makes this the more likely explanation			0
she said that in 20 years of working with @entity12 treatment she has never before come across quads being born following the implanting of just one embryo			1
she said : ' this is a very interesting case because it is very rare			0
' but the @entity56 , from @entity57 , are simply overjoyed at their luck – with the odds of having quads from one embryo estimated at more than two million to one			2
the babies had a combined weight of just over 10lb when they were born at the @entity63 in @entity64 on march 25			1
@entity21 weighed 2lb , followed by @entity22 at 2lb 3oz , @entity23 at 2lb 14oz and @entity24 at 3lb			1
mr @entity15 , a lorry driver , said : ‘ the girls are all doing well			2
now we ca n’t wait to get them home			0
’ he added that the couple were on the verge of giving up hope of a baby when they decided to try @entity12			1
just one embryo was implanted – and mrs @entity73 , 36 , found out she was pregnant only three weeks later			2
an initial scan suggested triplets , but a second revealed four babies			0
mr @entity15 , 43 , said : ‘ it was very emotional			2
we were happy , but worried about the logistics			0
’ the pregnancy also proved difficult as mrs @entity73 , a nurse , suffered from extreme morning sickness			0
the babies weighed 10lb in total and were born when mrs @entity73 was 30 weeks pregnant the girls were born at @entity64 's @entity63 , and are now being cared for in the special care baby unit at @entity86 , close to their parents ' home she was admitted to hospital at 24 weeks because she was breathless , but doctors kept her stable until 30 weeks before delivering the four babies by caesarean			1
experts believe the single embryo split into three before one of these split again , resulting in qudruplets			1
the couple hope to take all four babies , who were born on march 25 , home in june @entity101 of @entity64 , who carried out the fertility treatment , said : ‘ i have been working in @entity12 for over 20 years and this is the first case i am aware of where a single embryo transferred resulted in a quadruplet pregnancy			1
‘ previous @entity12 quadruplets have seen babies from both sexes and were reported after transferring two embryos at least			2
’ @entity21 was first born at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs , @entity22 followed also at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs 3oz , @entity23 was born at 2.47pm weighing 2lbs 14oz and the last was @entity24 , born weighing 3lbs at 2.48pm			1
mr @entity15 , 43 , said he and his wife had been able to take the biggest , @entity24 , out of the special unit and added : ‘ it was the first time either of us had pushed a pram			1
’ the parents said three weeks after the single embryo was implanted , a pregnancy test confirmed mrs @entity73 was pregnant			2
the 36 - year - old said : ‘ when we found out we were having four babies , i just could n’t believe it			0
i was speechless and to be honest , i did n’t believe it until i saw them for myself			0
’ mr @entity15 said : ‘ they are the first set of quads to be born from a single embryo , which then split into three			1
one of these three then split into two , to make twins			0
‘ on the birth of the children there were two placentas so we ’re not sure yet if we have two babies and the twins , or triplets and a singleton			0
‘ @entity138 will have to be carried out when they are 10 to 12 weeks old to confirm this			0
’ during the pregnancy , mrs @entity73 suffered from extreme morning sickness - known as hyperemesis gravidarum			0
she said : ‘ when the news came out about @entity144 , i knew exactly what she was going through			0
it did n’t stop until 27 weeks and it was exhausting			0
‘ i felt sick all the time , and i was tired and lethargic			0
i would n’t wish it on anybody			0
’ at 24 weeks , mrs @entity73 was taken into hospital with breathlessness , but doctors managed to keep the pregnancy under control until week 30 , when the girls were born by caesarean section .			2
