they are the fashionable way to keep disease at bay			0
but expensive fish oil supplements may be doing little for our hearts while putting sharks in peril			1
conservationists have warned that our appetite for omega - 3 supplements and capsules has led to rampant fishing of deep - sea sharks , whose huge livers are oozing with valuable oils			0
deep sea sharks , including the goblin shark ( pictured ) , are being killed for the oils found within their livers with some species taking decades to mature , the deep - sea dwellers are extremely vulnerable to over-exploitation			1
the charity @entity25 claims that ' pirate ' fisherman are taking full advantage of laws that allow shark oil extracted from species caught outside the @entity31 to be sold here			1
the liver oils , including @entity33 , is ' the new gold , ' said the charity			0
@entity36 wildlife scientist @entity35 said : ' the omega - 3 tablets that we buy comes from lots of different sources but there are some that are shark liver oil			1
@entity44 ( pictured right ) and mackerel ( left ) are also high in @entity33 ' there are some vessels actively targeting deep - water sharks			0
' the fats , which are particularly abundant in oily fish such as salmon and mackerel , are credited with boosting the health of the heart , body and brain , with studies linking them to staving off ills from heart attacks to dementia and depression			1
but several recent studies , including two large - scale round - ups , have questioned whether they help heart health			1
in demand : @entity33 supplements and capsules ( such as the one pictured ) come from many sources but some are shark liver oil the most recent , published in the @entity74 , crunched together the results of 20 studies involving almost 70,000 people			1
the review ’s @entity79 authors said that omega - 3 fats may help the heart by lowering levels of harmful blood fats , stopping harmful changes in heart rhythm , keeping the blood thin or lowering blood pressure			1
however , with studies coming to different conclusion , there was a need to clear up confusion			0
their analysis found that those who took omega - 3 were no less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than others			1
the @entity100 of @entity102 researchers , however , did not completely dismiss the idea of supplementation			0
they said that while their results do not back wide - scale use of @entity33 , more research is needed on the impact on different types of heart problems			1
dosage should also be investigated further			0
a second - round up , by @entity115 researchers in may , reached a similar conclusion			0
and two years ago , the @entity118 reported that heart attack patients who took omega - 3 were no less likely to go on to have a second heart attack than those who did not supplement their diet			2
craze : demand for omega - 3 fish oils is putting sharks in peril others say that fish ’s health benefits may lie elsewhere			2
professor @entity133 , of @entity134 , told the @entity135 : ‘ there is a beneficial effect from fish and it be fish oil or it may be something else			2
‘ heart disease rates have fallen a lot in the past 50 years anyway			2
‘ the biggest problem is people thinking that if they do take a supplement , they can do everything else wrong in terms of diet and lifestyle			0
’ but some experts believe the benefits to the brain are undisputable			2
dr @entity153 , an @entity154 academic who has spent years researching the effect of omega - 3 on behaviour , learning and mood , said : ‘ it is an irrefutable fact that the brain tissue needs fatty acids			0
