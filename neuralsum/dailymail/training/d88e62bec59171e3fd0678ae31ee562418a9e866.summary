@entity0 believes his @entity2 team will not improve until they learn to be more disciplined			1
the @entity2 manager faces @entity4 at @entity5 on sunday without nine players and is preparing to throw defender @entity7 , 19 , into the @entity9 fray once again			1
@entity11 ’s attack - minded team have scored nine goals in three games since the likes of @entity15 and @entity16 arrived at the end of the transfer window but continue to look vulnerable at the other end of the field			1
‘ you will see in the first half against @entity37 , also in the first half in the last match , very attacking and creative football			0
but i want to improve that we do n’t lose the ball so easily			0
that is our problem , not our defence			0
‘ we are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline			2
‘ so we are looking for a balance - without thinking too much of only attacking but also guarding			2
’ much has been made of @entity2 ’s injury problems at the back and the fact @entity11 did not spend heavily on a world - class central defender in the summer			1
the 19 - year - old @entity7 will play again on sunday as @entity2 still have three central defenders injured @entity16 is yet to score in three @entity9 appearances so far for @entity2 but he added : ‘ i want my defensive organisation to be better but the defence begins in the striker ’s position			1
the media are writing that the problems are because of the weak defence and i have explained i want to improve your knowledge of football also			0
' it ’s team work so when we concede a goal , it ’s not only because of an individual error in the defence			0
it starts somewhere else and that we have to analyse and improve			0
‘ all the teams are scoring goals out of counter-attacks mostly against us and free - kicks and corners			0
they do n’t make their goals like we do out of building up , first , second , third and fourth phase			0
‘ that ’s the difference and when you want to be a big team you have to perform like that			0
’ failure to dominate possession has been a @entity2 problem for a few years , even stretching back to sir @entity91 ’s time at the club			1
last season , meanwhile , @entity4 beat @entity2 twice in the league , the second game proving to be @entity96 ’s last before he was sacked in april			1
in the absence of defenders @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , @entity7 will continue alongside @entity102 at the back , getting the nod ahead of @entity105 because he is right - footed			2
@entity106 is back in the @entity2 squad but is unlikely to start			2
@entity96 ' last game in charge of @entity2 was his second defeat to former club @entity4 in april @entity4 travel to @entity5 on sunday having won just once in the @entity9 so far this season			1

@entity0 : @entity2 's forwards must be more ' disciplined '
@entity2 boss believes his attacking players lose possession too easily
he says the team 's problems are not with the defence but with ' balance '
@entity11 says ' defence begins in the striker 's position ' for his side
the 19 - year - old @entity7 expected to start at centre back for @entity2
@entity2 host @entity4 at @entity5 in sunday 's 12pm kick - off
