by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 18:03 est , 11 may 2012 thousands of volunteers began a huge clean - up of @entity4 ’s beaches yesterday			1
@entity5 has mobilised 4,500 staff to join local residents in mounting litter patrols on 100 of the country ’s beaches			2
the store is one of many businesses to have backed the @entity14 ’s @entity13 for the @entity16 campaign , pledging to do its best to rid our environment of litter in the run - up to the main jubilee celebrations next month			1
the @entity5 staff – drawn from every level of the company – are joining an expected 3,000 community volunteers to clear beaches over the weekend			1
mucking in : volunteers from @entity5 help with the clean - up at @entity29 , @entity30 yesterday saw a combined total of some 4,000 staff and residents rally to the cause at the first 36 beaches on their hit list , including @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 near @entity40 in @entity41 , and @entity42 in @entity43			1
between them , they filled 1,500 black bin bags with rubbish weighing 5,500kg			1
that included around 1,600 tin cans and 7,350 wrappers			2
the good spirit and fun of the operation was perfectly illustrated at @entity29 , where , despite blustery winds , around 150 people collected 31 black bin bags full of litter weighing a total of 46.25kg in just over an hour , covering a mile stretch			1
graphic designer @entity60 , 32 , who had donned pink wellies to help out , said : ‘ when we first got here and looked at the beach it did n’t look like it had any litter on it at all			2
yesterday saw 4,000 staff and residents rally to the cause at the first 36 beaches on their hit list , including @entity29 ( above ) , @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 near @entity40 in @entity41 , and @entity42 in @entity43 ' but when you start looking really close , you realise there ’s all these little bits all over the place			2
’ @entity76 , 34 , who works in @entity5 ’s fish team , said : ‘ it was mostly plastic , but we were amazed at some of the stuff we found ... which included a pink thong			2
‘ it ’s been a great day and it feels good to do your bit for the environment and help keep the country clean			2
’ @entity29 is a shingle beach dotted with vegetation , including sea kale and curled dock			2
@entity91 , agriculture manager at @entity5 in @entity92 , with beach litter it is one of only a few of its kind in the @entity4 , @entity99 and @entity100 and is a @entity101			2
children from three schools also helped out there , using metal detectors to locate cans and aerosols while enjoying a sunny day out of the classroom at the seaside			2
@entity110 , ten , from @entity111 , said : ‘ it was fun and we liked helping			2
we know it ’s bad if people leave these things on the beach because they can stay around for ages			0
’ as well as being a blot on the coastline , much of the rubbish found at @entity29 , as elsewhere , would be harmful to birds and fish should they swallow it or become trapped in it			1
among the unusual items discovered on beaches during yesterday ’s operation were a set of false teeth , a pair of tights , a baseball , various odd socks , a jumper , and some plastic ‘ vampire fangs ’			0
all the litter collectors at each beach were issued with gloves , litter pickers and bin bags			1
the collected rubbish was later handed over to councils for disposal			1
the @entity146 project is run in conjunction with the @entity148 and is in its first year			0
bosses organised the events in response to surveys by the @entity148 , which showed litter levels on beaches were unacceptably high			0
@entity155 , head of fundraising at the @entity148 , said most – around 60 per cent – of the litter found on @entity4 beaches is plastic such as bottle tops and cable ties , followed by food wrappers , then rope from the fishing industry or sea anglers ’ discarded line			0
@entity167 , director of @entity5 ’s ethical programme @entity168 , said : ‘ our customers care passionately about where their food comes from , especially fish			0
‘ we only source from the most sustainable sources , but this is something more , this is our chance to get out on to beaches with our customers and take direct action to help protect marine life and our coastline			0
’ the operation is funded by the 5p carrier bag charge in @entity183 , launched to combat the chronic number of bags littering our streets and waterways			1
since its introduction in 2008 , the charge has reduced carrier bag use by 80 per cent and raised over £ 4million for charity			1
@entity5 has pledged to give every volunteer who registers in advance a money - off voucher and provide snacks during the clean , which continues at locations around the country today and tomorrow			0
