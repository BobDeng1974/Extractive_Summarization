a senior @entity23 source said the prime minister had delayed the manifesto promise yet again after talks with @entity63			2
the chancellor does not want the issue of the tax break to distract from the @entity68 ’s focus on the economy			1

confirmation of the delay comes days after @entity187 poured scorn on the idea of the tax break			2
he said people would think it ‘ odd ’ to help families on the basis of whether they were married or not			0
the @entity196 leader , whose mps will be allowed to abstain on the break when it does comes to parliament , said : ‘ the more people will look at this , the more they will think – why should you be giving , whatever it is , £ 3 a week to married couples			1

a source said : ‘ there is a link between the two in that he believes strongly in both for similar reasons			0
if two people want to commit to each other and get married , and if they ’re gay , they should be able to			0
‘ he also believes in recognising commitment in the tax system			0
there is a connection but there is not a quid pro quo			0
’ the source said mr @entity10 acknowledged that gay marriage was a ‘ difficult ’ issue for some in the conservative party but said that he was ‘ proud ’ to be championing it			1
@entity230 , chief executive of the @entity231 , said : ' our complicated tax system makes it harder for people to start a family and often discriminates against married couples			1
