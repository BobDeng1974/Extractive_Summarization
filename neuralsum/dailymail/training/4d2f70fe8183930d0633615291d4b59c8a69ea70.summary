' it looked like he was thick with oil , fuel or petrol			1
he really , really stank			0
' his owner , who arrived in a ' shiny 4x4 ' could not even bear to pick him up , she added			0
vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly , petrol - coated fur he arrived with when @entity8 arrived at the centre , his previous owner could not touch him , said mrs @entity13			1
petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog , who had never been groomed , gave off a strong stench after spending time recovering at the centre , @entity8 has overcome his fear of interaction with humans , and plays happily with the other dogs in its care the dog will not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket he now wears but is prone to giving kisses ' she handed him over on a lead because she would n't even touch him			1
it is clear he has never been groomed			0

' now if i gently put my hand out , he will come to me and lick my face			0
it ’s wonderful to see him so happy again			0
' he ’s running around with the other dogs and enjoying his food again - he ’s put weight back on , too			2
' now he ca n’t stop drinking water - he goes to town on it because before his fur polluted the water when he tried to drink			2
' he is still terrified if i move too close to him i have to wait for him to come to me			2
we put his little coat on while he was still under sedation and it has n't been off since - it ’s a strong velcro so i know he will flip if i try			2
' the centre will be trying to find a new home for the dog once he has fully recovered from the trauma			2
' nothing prepares you for the heartache of taking in an abandoned and abused dogs , ' added mrs @entity13 , a former it manager			0
' cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs			2
' you do n’t have to love dogs - just respect them			0
' @entity13 said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you			0
