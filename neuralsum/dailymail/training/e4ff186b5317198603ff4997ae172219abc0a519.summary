@entity1 is the most common eye colour in @entity3 , researchers found			1
all eyes in the country were once brown , but a study revealed they are now 48 per cent blue , 30 per cent green and 22 per cent brown			1
the study , which mapped out eye colour across the @entity3 and @entity10 , revealed that the @entity11 and the @entity12 are more likely to have blue eyes than others - especially those living in the south			1
scientists believe the reason for the increase in the number of blue eyes could be to do with how attractive people find them			1
@entity29 and @entity35 have similarly low proportion of blue - eyed residents - just 44 and 41 per cent respectively - while in all regions of @entity10 at least half of people have blue eyes			1
@entity40 of @entity25 , which carried out the study , said he was surprised at the findings			0
he told @entity43 : ‘ a lot of people think blue eyes are much rarer than they are			0
’ he said the colour may be more dominant because it is regarded as attractive , adding : ‘ it may be that blue eyes are like the peacock ’s tail			2
it does n’t confer any evolutionary advantage … except that it gets him more mates			0
’ blue - eyed @entity57 stars @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 all support the theory that blue eyes add to a person 's sexual appeal			0
mr @entity40 added : ‘ all of them have inherited their eye colour … through their dna , and because of the way that blue eyes deal with light , they also appear to have inherited a natural sparkle			0
blue - eyed beauties : sought - after actresses @entity62 , left , and @entity60 are among those who support the theory that blue eyes are on the rise because they are regarded as attractive classic good looks : @entity63 , pictured right in 1969 film @entity82 , and @entity59 both have blue eyes , which scientists think could be better for attracting mates than other colours ' dark - coloured eyes … are able to absorb longer and shorter wavelengths and therefore they appear not to reflect [ light ]			2
’ the researchers who carried out the study now aim to discover why the distribution of blue eyes varies so significantly across the @entity3			1
the colour is the result of a variant in the @entity98 gene ‘ switching off ’ the melanin that forms brown eyes			0
people with green eyes have a combination of blue and brown variants			2
the project ’s dr @entity105 said brown may overtake blue again , adding : ‘ if rarity makes a feature more attractive then it could be that this process is reversed			0

all eyes in the country were once brown , but now they are 48 *%* blue
colour is most common in @entity10 and @entity11 , but least likely in the south
scientists believe increase could be down to how attractive people find them
researchers do *n't* know why there is so much variation across the @entity3
