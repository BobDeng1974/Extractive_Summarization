there was a moment after @entity3 ’s semi-final victory over @entity4 when @entity5 was reminded of his match - saving challenge on @entity7 late in the second half			1
‘ i thought i had slipped , i thought i would n’t make it , but i tore my arse on that move , the pain			2
’ he admitted after his perfectly - executed tackle inside the area prevented the @entity13 flyer from homing in on goal			2
@entity5 has worked long hours in the @entity20 boiler room over the years , toiling away at three @entity21 in that screening role in front of the back four			1
finally he has his reward			0
in many ways this is becoming @entity5 ’s @entity28			1
he was in the @entity20 team beaten by @entity30 in the 2006 quarter - final and again when @entity33 ’s team put four past them in @entity34 in 2010			1
at the final whistle in @entity49 he was overcome with emotion , in tears as he celebrated in front of @entity20 ’s supporters			2
‘ i know the people at home will be happy because two generations could not see @entity3 in the final of a @entity28 , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ they can see us there now so we are happy for that			0
i have spent a lot of time waiting for this moment			0
this is my third @entity28 and maybe this is my last one			2
’ flying @entity13 : @entity5 admits he did n't know if he would catch @entity7 last ditch : the @entity3 midfielder thought he had slipped before lunging in on @entity7 best defence : @entity5 blocks @entity7 's goalbound shot during the closing stages of the game @entity71 averted : @entity7 's shot is sent wide before @entity20 eventually won the game on penalties what a journey it has been for @entity5			1
eight years ago , as @entity77 operated in the after - glow of their @entity80 final appearance against @entity81 , @entity5 could n’t get a look - in ahead of @entity83			1
that was back in 2006 , when @entity5 arrived at @entity85 with @entity86			2
eight years on he is in the final , holding @entity20 together in the centre of midfield and preparing to face @entity33 ’s expressive team in the @entity44			1
on wednesday , @entity83 signed for @entity91			0
‘ when i could n’t play at @entity77 i kept my mentality and i went to train every day to be a better player , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i did n’t have the chance to play at @entity77 , but in football you always have a chance			0
when i went to @entity81 , i had the chance to show my quality			0
’ moving on : it is eight years since @entity5 arrived in the @entity101 with @entity77 onwards and upwards : the @entity104 went on to play for @entity81 and is currently at @entity105 he flourished at @entity106 , going on to play in the @entity108 final in 2007 against @entity109 just months after his move from @entity77			1
this weekend it is the international stage again , aiming for glory in @entity113 as @entity115 ’s team attempt to recreate the glory of @entity117 in 1978 and @entity118 in 1986			0
@entity20 ’s players watched this powerful @entity30 team take @entity121 apart in @entity122 on tuesday , watching a performance of shock and awe from their @entity49 hotel			1
to win their third @entity28 , @entity20 will have to break @entity128 momentum and prevent @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 getting into their stride			1
proud : @entity5 and @entity45 are pleased to have given their country @entity28 finalists sharp shooter : @entity129 playmaker : @entity130 anchorman : @entity131 that job will fall to @entity5 and his midfield accomplices @entity141 and @entity143			1
‘ @entity30 are formidable , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ they have technique , potential and style			0
they beat @entity121 , but we will have to be concentrated and make sure they have no space			2
we ca n’t think about being in @entity121 or that is means more because we are playing in @entity121			0
it is a @entity28 and this is a chance we have dreamed of			0
‘ we have to avoid thinking about the scale of the situation			0
if you play against @entity30 and you leave space for them then it will be very difficult for us			0
we need to be narrow , we need to be compact			0
’ if they lose a @entity28 final , the agony will go on			1
@entity3 scrape into fifth final			0

@entity5 made a late , match - saving tackle on @entity7 in the @entity28
