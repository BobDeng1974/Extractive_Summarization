by @entity0 published : 16:27 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 04:15 est , 26 september 2013 last week , i met up with an old boyfriend			1
we 've both moved on and there 's as much spark left between us as a soggy box of matches			1
but you never want a former lover walking away thinking : ' she 's let herself go			1
' you want them to leave thinking : ' why did i ever let her go ? ' so i wore my new @entity14 dress , which is fitted and discreetly sexy			1
i blow - dried my hair , slipped on a pair of shoes and off i went			1
standing tall : @entity0 loves her high heels , left , and felt less attractive in her flats i had arrived early at our chosen restaurant , so was seated when he arrived			1
' you look gorgeous , ' he said			1
then , as i stood up to kiss him , the cad did n't even attempt to conceal the shock in his eyes			1
' @entity29 , you 've got shorter , ' he said			1
recovering quickly , he added : ' but putting on a few pounds really suits you			1
' oh , the shame			1
when we were together , he thought i was lovely			2
now he looked at me as though i was @entity33 's mum : a short , portly hobbit with weird feet			2
and that ’s exactly how i felt			2
i had n't gained weight , or lost height ; i 'd simply ditched my usual skycraper heels for flat shoes			1
and all in the name of fashion			2
me , the queen of vertiginous @entity44 , the woman who has been known to moan ' @entity46 ' in her sleep , had decided to give up her high heels for a week			1
no allure : even though some of the flats were glitzy , @entity0 still felt unglamorous flats are having a style moment			1
at the recent @entity57 fashion shows , the joke doing the rounds was that all the editors were three inches shorter than usual , because they 'd eschewed their usual high heels for flatties			1
@entity62 - coated pumps , biker boots , buckled ' monk ' shoes ... there was only one thing all the new styles had in common : they were totally flat			2
i thought they looked ok - ish until i got to my local pub for a roast lunch and a friend came over			2
he whispered in my ear : ' @entity0 , you forgot to take your slippers off ' now , i do n't like the idea of flat shoes - i 've worn high heels all my life , and am labouring under the misapprehension that i 'm an @entity81 lovely pushing 6ft , instead of a rather ordinary 5ft 6¾in - but nor do i like the idea of looking terminally unfashionable			1
and on the day i met my ex-boyfriend , i had comforted myself with the fact that the heel-less shoes i was wearing were @entity44 ( who knew he also did flatties ? ) , with a price tag of £ 265			2
the label is glamorous and chic , and i hoped what the pumps lacked in height they would make up for in super-fashionable glitz			1
but i have never felt less glamorous in my life			2
i wore the shoes on and off for a few days , trying to get used to the odd sensation of walking flat - footed like a duck - and looking like one , too			2
i swear they were as painful as my six - inch heels , rubbing the back of my ankles as i walked , squeezing my toes like a vice			1
and for what ? to look dumpy			2
get shorty : on one occasion she was asked if she was wearing her slippers to the pub while on another , she felt like a hobbit like many women , i 've always worried about my weight			2
even when i lost two stone after my last break - up , i still thought i was podgy			2
i 'm a size 12 , but the only times in my life i feel slim - ish are when i am wearing vertiginous heels			1
it 's well known that heels elongate the leg , make you walk in a more upright , deliberate , saucy way , and give you confidence			1
that 's why women buy them			2
yet while i 've been wedded to my six - inch heels for most of my 55 years on this earth , as a shoe lover i have to admit to a frisson of excitement when 15 pairs of flats arrived at my home last week , courtesy of the @entity138 's fashion team , who 'd very generously gathered a collection for me to try			1
well , who would n't be excited about unwrapping all those shoes ? i inspected each pair - snakeskin and suede , bejeweled , brogues , glittery , gaudy , @entity148 and designer - and lined them up by the front door so each day i could choose another pair			2
they felt a little like aliens invading my home , but i was prepared to give them a try			2
lacking sex appeal : the shoe fanatic said she 'll only keep the flats for meeting up with the girls for sunday lunch , i teamed £ 149 black paisley velvet slippers from @entity162 with skinny black trousers , a long black top and short suede jacket			2
normally i 'd wear this outfit with my @entity169 wedge - heeled trainers			0
yes , i even have heels with my trainers			1
they give a girl a lift			0
i thought they looked ok - ish until i got to my local pub for a roast lunch and a friend came over			0
he whispered in my ear : ' @entity0 , you forgot to take your slippers off			1
' the ignominy , the shame			0
a slut who leaves home in her slippers ! move over , @entity188			0
i was too embarrassed to put him right			0
i had imagined that my new flats would give me freedom to walk more - and they did , but not the long distances i 'd imagined			0
the problem with them is that they 're so flat , they give your feet no support			0
men 's shoes have a heel			0
even trainers go up at the back			0
but walking so flat - footed is quite uncomfortable , as well as ungainly			0
even in my best frocks i felt frumpy			1
on the plus side , i did discover that my taxi bill fell , especially for the short distances you ca n't even contemplate in high heels			1
c'est chic : only @entity211 's former first lady @entity210 can pull off wearing flats one day , attempting @entity57 casual - cool , i put on opaque tights , a cute , clingy lace dress i 'd bought from @entity216 and my newly - acquired @entity218 black leather ' @entity219 '			0
they 're like loafers , but with a side - fastening strap across the top			0
the reflection looking back at me in the mirror was n't half - bad , and i left my house feeling young and hip			0
the male friend i was having a drink with said i looked like a @entity231 girl			0
i blushed and modestly inquired which one , secretly hoping it would be @entity234			0
' @entity236 , ' he replied , in mock horror			0
' it looks like you could kill a man with one blow in those			0
' ms @entity236 , of course , is the ugly @entity244 assassin whose deadly weapon is a poisoned knife concealed in her clumpy brogues			0
high heels make a woman 's body slimmer , her legs longer , her head held higher			1
that 's why we love them - and why men love them right back i was starting to see a pattern here			0
while women might love the comfort and stylish insouciance of flat shoes , men hate them			0
they 're just not sexy			0
there was never a pair of ' kiss me quick ' or ' fancy me ' flat shoes			0
for a work lunch at a @entity57 restaurant on monday , i teamed a navy frock ( which i 'd normally wear with my black suede @entity274 stilettos ) with @entity276 & @entity277 's navy blue suede flats			0
they had cute tassles on them , were n't too pointy and had a tiny bejeweled heel			0
they were ' power flats ' and they reminded me of @entity210 , one of the few women in the world who can carry off flats with even a hint of glamour			0
one of my girl friends did say she loved my new flat - shoed look when we met for dinner on tuesday evening			0
i 'd teamed grey zebra - print flats with capri trousers and a white belted top			0
i felt like i was channelling @entity297 , who managed to make mannish trousers and flat shoes look undeniably sexy			1
my friend certainly gushed about how stylish i looked , too - but then she is a flat shoe fanatic , who is always poking fun at my heels and reminding me how bad they are for my back , not to mention my bunions			1
and after a week away from my heels - and the backache and aching feet which come with them - i 'm prepared to concede that there is a place in my life for this season 's stylish flatties			1
out of the 14 pairs of shoes i 've worn the past week , there are three i 'd like to own : the black velvet ones my friend thought were slippers , the zebra - print pair , and some maroon brogues which i thought looked quite good with trousers , if a little @entity324			1
flats , whether they be jewelled , tassled or doing the fandango , will not become my staple footwear unless i break an ankle again			0
( last year , i took a nasty tumble courtesy of my kitten , and spent a good few weeks separated from my @entity44			0
) but this is not because i do n't adore some of the latest modern styles : it 's because flatties make you a fattie			1
high heels make a woman 's body slimmer , her legs longer , her head held higher			1
that 's why we love them - and why men love them right back			0
so , i 'll keep my flats and i will wear them - but only when i 'm out with the girls .			0

to fit in with the latest trend , @entity0 tried giving up her heels for a week
but they made her feel unglamorous and frumpy
she did save money on taxi *journeys*
but she loves her heels as they make her look slim
