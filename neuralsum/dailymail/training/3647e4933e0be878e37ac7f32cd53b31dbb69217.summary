@entity0 may not be a household name yet , but the 15 - year - old @entity3 - loving tennis junior from @entity4 is about to be			1
just three years after a tiny @entity6 posed with her idol @entity7 , the wild card stunned @entity9 finalist @entity8 in the biggest upset of the @entity11 so far , winning 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 4 against the 12th seed in her grand slam debut			1
but who is @entity6 - the number two junior in the world who became the youngest woman to win a match at the @entity11 since @entity18 in 1996 and the youngest @entity19 to win a match at the @entity11 since @entity21 in 1986 ? delight : the young star celebrates her win against the 12th seed in the @entity11 first round the bubbly teenager was born in april 1999 in @entity28 and lives in @entity29 , @entity4			1
she first picked up a racket when she was just three , and was naturally gifted thanks to her lineage - her mother played junior tournaments when she was younger			1
but it was just four years ago - when she was 11 - that she properly turned her focus to the game			2
' i went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience , but i never thought i would come out on top , ' said the teenager , who next plays @entity44 @entity43			0
@entity6 , ranked 1,208 , is currently the no. 2 junior behind @entity46 of @entity47			0
cute : an adorable 12 - year - old @entity6 poses with @entity7 on court just three years ago she has won a series of prestigious junior titles including the @entity51 , @entity52 , and the @entity53			2
â€‹ she 's also playing the @entity11 junior tournament			2
@entity6 's amateur status means she is unable to claim the more than 60,000 @entity19 dollars in prize money for a first - round victory , but she is in no rush to turn professional			1
she said : ' i think i 'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college , in case an injury or something happens			0
but i 'd love to be a pro one day			0
' @entity6 's wild card was n't charity , she earned it when she won the @entity52 @entity68 , becoming the youngest to win the title since @entity70 , according to @entity71			0
serving up a shock : although she is junior world no 2 , little was expected of the 15 - year - old wildcard strain : @entity8 looked to have sorted out her problems in the second set but @entity0 came back to win disbelief : @entity0 sinks to her knees after winning the final point of a pulsating match her idol is @entity82 and the youngster says she models her game style and energy after the four - time major champion , though an adorable picture shows a tiny @entity6 posing with @entity7 just three years ago			1
' it 's crazy to think that i 'm actually here right now with all these other people , ' she said of tuesday 's match			0
' i never thought i would be practicing or sharing a court with a player that i watch on tv frequently			0
