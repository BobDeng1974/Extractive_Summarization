@entity1 's stepfather @entity0 has warned of an ' ugly rush ' on overseas aid spending the government ’s overseas aid target is creating an ‘ ugly rush ’ to spend billions of pounds , @entity1 ’s stepfather warned last night			1
@entity0 said a recent report by the @entity9 , which revealed ministers had to spend an extra £ 1billion at the end of 2013 to hit the target , underlined the danger of fixing such goals in law			1
legislation requiring future governments to continue spending 0.7 per cent of @entity19 ’s income on foreign aid moved a step closer yesterday with a second reading in the @entity23			1
but several senior peers spoke out against the move , which required a 30 per cent increase in @entity19 ’s aid budget in 2013 to £ 11.5billion			2
lord @entity0 , who is married to mrs @entity1 ’s mother @entity28 , said he supported foreign aid spending , but it was a mistake to enshrine the target in law			1
the issue should be a ‘ matter of policy rather than law ’ , he added , and the @entity9 report showed a target could produce an ‘ ugly rush ’ to spend money at the end of the year in a ‘ panic ’			2
former @entity43 chancellor @entity42 said the new law was ‘ against both the national interest and , ultimately , the interests of people in poor countries ’			0
@entity49 said singling out particular items of public expenditure for ‘ special treatment ’ could only have ‘ disastrous ’ results			0
protecting some programmes would lead to bigger cuts in unprotected areas , he added			0
‘ this is a mad way to run the public finances			0
’ @entity49 said the @entity9 report showed money had been ‘ rushed out ’ to meet the aid target and led to people doing ‘ stupid things ’			2
former @entity43 @entity64 commissioner lord @entity63 said he accepted that @entity19 aid had an important part to play in tackling global poverty , but it was ‘ never a good idea ’ to set a target that would be binding			0
‘ it will deprive government of flexibility to respond to changing circumstances , ’ he added			0
@entity73 ( pictured with wife @entity74 ) adopted the pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of @entity19 ’s income on foreign aid before the last election , as part of his drive to ‘ detoxify ’ the @entity43 but former @entity43 cabinet minister @entity81 backed the @entity82 , saying it was ‘ what i would expect from a civilised and outward - looking country that recognises it has responsibilities to try to help the position of the poorest people in other parts of the world ’			1

the @entity95 peer @entity94 of @entity96 , who introduced the @entity82 , said the measure was in @entity19 ’s ‘ long - term interests ’ and would ‘ play a major role in securing a long - term level of support for those in the world most in need ’ .			0
