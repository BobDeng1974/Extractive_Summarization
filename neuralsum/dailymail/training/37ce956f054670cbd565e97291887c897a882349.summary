well , it ’s not often that a humble country road sign gets mentioned on the floor of the @entity3			1
but one particular example has been drawn to the attention of no less grand a figure than the @entity7 @entity7 mp			2
on the face of it , the story reported in the @entity11 the other day about a @entity13 road sign , which , thanks to mad council bureaucracy , has remained hidden in the undergrowth alongside the @entity17 for two years , looked as though it could be a candidate for @entity19			1
as the sign ’s owner , @entity20 , limply explained , it could n’t send anyone out to restore the sign to its proper position because the council would first have had to consult nearly two dozen ‘ statutory consultees ’ for permission to do so			1
when tackled on the issue by a @entity13 mp , mr @entity31 , the @entity32 , agreed this was plain daft			1
he told @entity36 ( @entity36 mp for @entity37 ) , the council ’s attitude did seem ‘ fairly barmy ’			1
a @entity13 road sign has remained hidden in the undergrowth alongside the @entity17 for two years thanks to mad council bureaucracy but the more one looks into this sorry story , it seems mr @entity31 did n’t appreciate the half of it			1
the fact is that the word ‘ barmy ’ does n’t begin to do justice to the idiocy of what has been going on in the county in which i happen to live — and which , undoubtedly , is also happening all over @entity52			1
for a start , the sign — if one could see it where it lies , hidden in the bushes — is one of some importance			2
it was originally put up to warn traffic of a potentially dangerous turning from a minor side road into the busy main @entity17 between @entity62 and @entity63			2
there had been several serious accidents along this stretch of road , and the purpose of erecting the sign was to alert drivers to the turn - off to two small villages and make sure they watched out for vehicles emerging from the side road into the flow of traffic			2
when the sign fell off its metal posts two years ago , it should have been a very simple matter to put it back in place			0
as ms @entity36 observed after being told of the problem by locals and visiting the site herself : ‘ all it needed was for someone to hoick the sign out of the undergrowth where it had fallen off its posts and use four clips to pin it back up			2
’ but , inevitably , in a country increasingly dragged down by jobsworths and bureaucracy , such common sense was not taken into consideration by the dead hand of officialdom			0
the council ’s response was that it could n’t dream of carrying out such a simple task until it had been given the go - ahead by a long list of ‘ consultees ’ — the various public and private bodies deemed by law to have a potential interest in the matter			1
it claims it has to do this under a combination of — you ’ve guessed it — ‘ health and safety ’ legislation , and rules laid down in the @entity116 and @entity117			0
but when the council sent ms @entity36 a full list of the ‘ consultees ’ , she could scarcely believe her eyes			1
they included a whole range of major utilities , from @entity126 and @entity127 to @entity128 ( based 100 miles away in @entity129 )			0
@entity3 leader @entity7 ( left ) called the situation ' barmy ' after @entity36 , @entity36 mp for @entity37 , raised the issue in the @entity3 there were two separate departments of @entity134 : one for electricity , the other for gas			1
also included on the list were @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 ; two separate departments of @entity143 ; @entity144 , based in @entity145 ; and @entity146 , based in @entity147			0
what on earth was going on here ? of course , one can understand the need to consult such bodies whenever it is necessary to dig a hole that might interfere with their pipes or wires			0
indeed , that is precisely what the @entity116 and @entity117 covers — with respect to works requiring the digging of holes more than ‘ 77 mm ’ deep			0
but what , for heaven ’s sake , could the lifting of a roadside sign out of a @entity13 hedgerow have to do with the organisation in charge of our national railway network — let alone mighty international corporations based as far away as @entity147 and @entity145 ? it seems that the council ’s ‘ @entity179 ’ took upon itself the task of drawing up its own list of organisations that it thought were necessary to consult			1
it then lamely conceded that it did not actually have to consult every single one of those 22 organisations before putting up that road sign again			1
‘ on average , ’ it said , ‘ we only have to consult 12 or 14			2
’ even so , the hassle involved in contacting all 22 firms was enough for @entity20 officials to put the case of the ‘ @entity191 ’ firmly at the back of their ‘ pending tray ’			1
in fact , as a @entity13 council taxpayer — along with my neighbours — i have long known that our council ’s highways department is notorious for its reluctance to keep its road signs in good order			1
for years , the main signpost in our little village was allowed to become so rust - covered that its lettering became illegible			0
in the end , my son , @entity208 , who lives in @entity209 , took matters into his own hands during a visit and went out with some paint and a brush to make it look good as new again			0
the council is n’t always so pathetically slow to act , though			0
a few years back , the residents of many @entity13 villages were amazed to see teams of workmen plastering every conceivable roadside and lane with spanking new 30 mph speed limit signs			0
as a result , one village reported it now had 30 signs along just 200 yards of road			0
our own village was decorated with 22 of them , including two on such a sharp zig - zag bend in the centre of the village that not even @entity237 champion @entity236 could have got round it at more than 5 mph			0
but when i asked the council how much all this sign - mania was costing — at a time when it had raised our taxes by twice the rate of inflation — they were strangely coy			0
i was firmly told by the ‘ portfolio holder ’ of the ‘ @entity248 ’ that we could n’t be allowed to know how much they were pouring into this scheme as ‘ there is a degree of commercial sensitivity with regard to this information ’			0
in other words , the council is quite happy to take our money , but refuses to tell us how it is spending it			0
since then , it seems little has changed with our local county council ’s casual approach to the hard - earned cash they extract from those of us who live here			1
in august , it was revealed that @entity13 ’s director of children ’s services , @entity267 , was being paid £ 318,000 a year for working just a four - day week , making him the highest - paid council official in the country			2
he had come to work in @entity13 from the @entity209 borough of @entity273 , where he had replaced the disgraced @entity275 , who was sacked after presiding over the @entity275 scandal , only to be awarded £ 600,000 in compensation			0
last month , we learned that mr @entity267 himself has now been sacked by @entity20 , in advance of an @entity283 report giving his department its lowest possible rating — ‘ inadequate ’ — for the second year running			2
much the same charge might be levelled at the feeble officials of @entity13 ’s highways department for their hopeless attitude to the maintenance of road signs — an incompetence that is , sadly , so typical of clipboard - carrying municipal jobsworths all over the country .			1
