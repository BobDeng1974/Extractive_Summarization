fossils of three squirrel - like species from the time of the dinosaurs suggest mammals have been around on @entity5 for more than 200 million years			1
the discovery in @entity8 , @entity9 , pushes back the date that mammals roamed the planet by around 40 million years , researchers claim			1
the creatures , which are around the size of a mouse , also provide more clues about how the first mammals began diversifying			2
the discovery of three new squirrel - like rodents from the time of the dinosaurs suggests that mammals have been around on @entity5 for more than 200 million years			1
pictured is a reconstruction of the new mammal species , @entity26			0
this mouse - sized animal was a tree dweller in the @entity30 forests scientists believe they later evolved into egg - laying monotremes such as the platypus , marsupials like the opossum , and placentals which include humans and whales			0
the six well - preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called @entity42 which until recently were only known from teeth			1
' for decades scientists have been debating whether the extinct group , called @entity42 , belongs within or outside of @entity45 , ' said dr @entity46 , at the @entity47 in @entity48			1
' previously everything we knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth			0
but the new specimens we discovered are extremely well preserved			0
the well - preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called @entity42 which until recently were only known from teeth			1
pictured is the fossil of @entity61 , which represents a new species of euharamiyidan mammal			0
it is a nearly complete skeleton that indicates a slender body with a tail ' and based on these fossils we now have a good idea of what these animals really looked like which confirms they are indeed mammals			2
' the six well - preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called @entity42			1
haramiyidans represent one of the earliest known mammals and range from the @entity80 to the @entity30			0
previously everything scientists knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth			2
but the new specimens discovered are extremely well preserved			0
from their structure scientists have learned @entity86 , which were part of the @entity88 were good climbers and probably spent more time in trees than squirrels			2
the members of @entity95 likely ate insects , nuts , and fruit with their ' strange ' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns			1
despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian			2
the animals have been named @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity26 and lived about 160 million years ago during the @entity30 period			1
the study , published in the journal nature , suggests they evolved from a common ancestor during the @entity80 around 208 million years ago			1
they have placed in a new group - or clade - called @entity95 and probably looked similar to small squirrels			1
they weighed between 1 and 10oz ( 28g and 280g ) and had tails and feet suggesting they were tree dwellers			0
' they were good climbers and probably spent more time than squirrels in trees , ' said dr @entity46			0
' their hands and feet were adapted for holding branches - but not good for running on the ground			0
' the members of @entity95 likely ate insects , nuts , and fruit with their ' strange ' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns			1
mammals are believed to evolve from a common ancestor that had three cusps - human molars can have up to five			0
but the newly discovered species had two parallel rows of cusps on each molar with up to seven cusps on each side			0
how this complex tooth pattern evolved in relation to those of other mammals has puzzled scientists for decades			2
but despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian			2
this reconstruction shows arboreal mammals in a @entity30 forest			0
the three animals on the left side represent the three new species of euharamiyidan mammals for example the specimens show evidence of a typical mammalian middle ear - the area just inside the eardrum that turns vibrations in the air into ripples in the ear 's fluids			2
the middle ears of mammals are unique in that they have three bones - as evidenced in the new fossils			0
based on the age of the @entity95 , species the divergence of mammals from reptiles had to have happened much earlier than some research has estimated			1
instead of originating in the middle jurassic between 176 and 161 million years ago mammals likely first appeared in the @entity80 between 235 and 201 million years ago - a finding corresponding with some studies using dna data			1
dr @entity187 said : ' what we 're showing here is very convincing that these animals are mammals and we need to turn back the clock for mammal divergence			0
' but even more importantly these new fossils present a new suite of characters that might help us tell many more stories about ancient mammals			0
' the fossils were found in the @entity200 , daxishan site of @entity201 in @entity8 , @entity9			1

fossils of 3 species were *uncovered* in @entity8 , @entity9
they lived 160 million years ago and looked like today 's squirrels
find shows mammals have been around more than 200 million years
creatures , weighing one to 10 oz ( 28g to 283g ) , belong to @entity42 group
scientists have placed them in a new *category* , called @entity95
they ate insects , nuts , and fruit and had ' strange ' pointed teeth
