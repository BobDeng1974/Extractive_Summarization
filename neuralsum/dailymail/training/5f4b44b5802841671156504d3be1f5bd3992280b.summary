no superlative is spared in the letter from @entity2 to @entity31 , governor of the state of @entity33 , on @entity35 - headed notepaper and dated january 17			1
he uses the phrases ' extremely happy ' , ' one of the highlights of the tournament ' , ' wonderful city ' and ' dream come true ' in his sycophantic letter			2
