by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 18:06 est , 2 august 2013 peers with serious criminal records or those who stop attending @entity3 could be kicked out of the @entity4			1
the proposal follows the storm of criticism yesterday over the appointment of 30 new members – a move which left all three main party leaders accused of polluting politics			0
now , after being attacked for rewarding major donors , cronies and lobbyists , senior ministers say they will seek to introduce fresh @entity4 reforms to cut the upper chamber			1
@entity19 ( pictured left ) was jailed , but could continue as a peer , while @entity22 ( right ) could lose his seat following his perjury jail term at the moment the @entity4 , which has swollen to 836 members , is second only to the @entity27 as the largest legislature in the world			1
but under the proposals peers who do not attend the @entity4 or who have left the country will be told to retire			1
and those who have been given custodial sentences of a year or more will be stripped of their peerages			0
currently mps are kicked out of the @entity39 if they are sentenced to more than a year behind bars			1
but peers are simply banned from the @entity4 for the duration of their sentence or for the period when they are bankrupt			2
the new plans would affect @entity47 peer and novelist @entity22 , who was jailed for four years for perjury and perverting the course of justice in 2001			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) is second only to the @entity27 as the largest legislature in the world			1
under new proposals peers who do not attend the @entity4 or who have left the country will be told to retire but they would not hit @entity19 , who received a nine - month sentence in 2011 for fiddling his expenses			2
@entity60 ministers , backed by @entity47 cabinet office minister @entity61 , are now drawing up plans to give life peers the opportunity to retire			1
they would keep their titles but would lose the right to claim allowances and vote on legislation			0
ministers have also vowed to tackle the huge levels of absenteeism			0
at least 51 peers who are thought to have moved abroad are expected to lose their places			0
and hundreds of peers rarely or never speak in the upper chamber but are still able to claim allowances of £ 300 a day			2
plans to make the @entity4 an elected chamber were shelved last year after a bitter row between the @entity47 and @entity60			1
the @entity60 are still keen to remove the ‘ historical anomaly ’ that allows 92 hereditary peers to remain in the @entity4			1
but they are apparently unwilling to push the idea for fear of generating further opposition from the conservatives			0
@entity85 , pictured at his pub the @entity86 in @entity87 , told mr @entity88 : ' i am now saying : @entity91 , you are in charge , show some leadership , do n't bottle out ' a senior @entity60 source said his party would rather have an elected chamber , but that the @entity97 will tackle the worst elements of the existing rules			1
‘ the current system is archaic , as we ’ve seen this week			0
‘ any other reforms in this area must not be seen as a substitute for meaningful democratic reform of the @entity4 , ’ they said			2
‘ but we are looking at the areas of low hanging fruit which almost everyone agrees are crying out for reform – some sort of retirement plan , dealing with those who have been convicted of criminal offences and those who never turn up or live abroad			0
’ proposals to offer peers a chance to retire have already been put forward by former @entity60 leader @entity119			2
but @entity121 sources say government legislation is now being written that would bring all the @entity4 reforms into effect			2
details of the new plans emerged as @entity88 came under pressure from his own party to ‘ show some leadership ’ and stop the next election being fought with ‘ dirty money ’			0
@entity85 , a former member of the joint committee on @entity134 , called for political donations to be capped at £ 5,000 to stop people buying their way into the @entity4			1
speaking on the @entity139 ’s today programme , @entity85 told mr @entity88 : ‘ i am now saying : @entity91 – you are in charge , show some leadership , do n’t bottle out			0
please take a lead and shame people into doing it			0
we can stop the next election being fought with dirty money			0
