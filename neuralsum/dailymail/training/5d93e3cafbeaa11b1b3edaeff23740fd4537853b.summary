critics have accused @entity1 of being ' elitist ' after he drew up a guide for city planners which attempts to banish unsightly concrete , phone wires , tower blocks and cars			1
the prince wrote his ten - point plan as part of a ' big rethink ' on how to design cities for a world population expected to hit almost 10billion by 2050			1
despite denying he wanted to return @entity15 to a ' @entity16 ' , his list prompted mixed responses among architecture experts			1
rethink : prince @entity1 at his new - build town of @entity20 in @entity21			1
he has written a ten - point guide for city architects which shuns wires , cars , concrete and tower blocks in favour of traditional principles professor @entity31 of @entity32 attacked his often - quoted dismissal of high - rise towers in favour of @entity37 - style mansion blocks , which exist in @entity39 's most expensive areas			1
' the combined impact of these principles , when backed up with the examples he uses , is socially regressive and elitist , ' prof @entity31 told @entity42			1
' when he considers the " charm and beauty of a place like @entity48 " he sort of forgets that the average price of property is £ 2,085,950			0
' he added that in @entity20 , the prince 's experimental town in @entity21 , the ' average detached house costs £ 458,946 ' - more than £ 60,000 above the national average			0
other critics told the newspaper the manifesto sounded ' cranky ' and like it was written by a ' fussy grandmaster of a masonic lodge '			2
transport planning consultant @entity57 complained on @entity58 about the prince 's lack of formal sources for his claim , saying he had only consulted the government 's @entity63			2
out : the prince said tower blocks were ' isolating and alienating '			2
pictured is the brutalist @entity68 in @entity39 's @entity69 , which remained the tallest residential block in @entity15 for several years but there were some supporters , including @entity74 architect @entity73 , who wrote : ' hats off for anyone who speaks up , no matter what they are saying			2
' @entity79 , a member of the @entity80 , added : ' some think of the @entity1 as a dilettante			1
i believe he sees the big picture while his critics do not			2
' prince @entity1 has been outspoken on architecture issues for many years			1
he founded a @entity87 and supported the new - build village of @entity20 in @entity21 , which was created on his land in a bid to challenge post-war ideas about planning			1
his critics have accused him of trying to influence the government after he wrote personal memos to ministers , which the government has blocked from release in a nine - year legal fight			0
in his piece , the prince insisted his ten - point plan ' does not deny the benefits and convenience that our modern technology brings			0
' far from it , the aim is to mix the best of the old with the best of the new			0
symmetry : the prince called on designers to follow traditional principles and ideas about beauty ' all i am suggesting is that the new alone is not enough			0
we have to be mindful of the long - term consequences of what we construct			0
' writing in the magazine @entity122 , the @entity1 added : ' i have lost count of the times i have been accused of wanting to turn the clock back to some @entity16			1
' nothing could be further from my mind			0
my concern is the future			0
' we face the terrifying prospect by 2050 of another three billion people on this planet needing to be housed , and architects and urban designers have an enormous role to play in responding to this challenge			0
' he compared well - planned cities with a rose because humans do not have to think about why a rose is beautiful - they simply know it is			0
referencing ' spiritual mathematics ' and ' sacred geometry ' , he said the best designs , including the @entity147 mausoleum in @entity148 , could be drawn from points around a basic circle			0
1 developments must ' respect the land ' and not be too intrusive 2 buildings must abide by the ' language ' , ' grammar ' and ' ground rules ' of architecture 3 new blocks should not be oversized compared to the buildings surrounding them 4 there must be ' coherence ' between nearby buildings by using similar balconies or railings 5 people need ' well - designed enclosures ' which encourage walking and make them feel safe 6 traditional or regional materials should beat ' bland ' concrete , aluminium , glass and steel 7 signs , lights and utilities should be avoided and as many wires as possible should be buried 8 streets ' must be reclaimed from the car ' and pedestrians must be put first in all designs 9 @entity181 ' isolating ' high - rise towers and instead build mansion blocks like those in @entity185 10 be flexible to the situation , building and area - avoid following ' rigid , conventional ' rules			1
