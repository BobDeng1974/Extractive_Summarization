isis are infamous for publishing gruesome videos of beheadings or footage of soldiers training - but it seems they have now taken a softer tact in an attempt to appeal to women			2
the militants have begun publishing guides for @entity12 wives on how to be ' ultimate wives of jihad ' complete with cartoon illustrations on a pink background			1
the videos include guides on how to perform basic first aid , what to cook for @entity21 after battles , and how to stitch up damaged clothing			2
@entity0 have published videos trying to encourage more women to join their cause by outlining ' feminine manual labour ' they can do to help the jihadists , instead of joining in the fighting among the tasks listed are basic first aid and cooking - along with ' quick and simple ' recipe suggestions including date balls which ' will extend the power and strength of the mujahadeen ' the videos were published on @entity39 and @entity40 by the @entity41 , an arm of @entity0 that is seeking to recruit women to the cause , and give advice to those already in @entity47 and @entity48			1
their slogan is ' preparing for the honour of jihad ' and their online accounts - which post only in @entity55 - have attracted thousands of followers so far			2
among the tips given out are some ' quick and simple ' recipes , such as one for ' date balls ' that are made by mixing dates , flour and butter together			0
as @entity0 's strict religious code forbids women from fighting , instead they are told to assist jihad by sewing clothes and editing propaganda videos the guide says : ' this is a quick recipe that can be served to the mujahedin [ is militants ] with coffee or can be eaten at any time with water , especially during breaks in battles			1
they contain significant calories and will extend the power and strength of the mujahadeen , @entity85 willing			0
' @entity86 , of the anti-extremist group @entity87 , told @entity88 : ' i have n't seen anything like this before			0
@entity92 , 20 , a @entity93 jihadi , is thought to be leading the all - female @entity95 brigade which operated in the de-fact @entity0 capital of @entity97 ' there will probably be forums doing similar things online , but this is the first time i 've come across an actual media organisation giving guidance to women on their role			1
' the phenomenon of women going over to @entity47 or @entity48 is not new and it is not a purely @entity110 phenomenon			0
there are more women going from countries like @entity114			0
' @entity0 strictly forbid women from taking part in combat , and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through ' feminine manual labour '			1
among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage , in an effort to make more propaganda , and participating in ' jihadi science ' - which is not explained further			0
it is not known exactly how many women have joined @entity0 , but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them			0
there are two all - female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of @entity97 , in @entity47 , including @entity95 , which is thought to be lead by @entity92 , 20 , a @entity93 female jihadi			1
the brigade , whose job is to patrol the streets of @entity97 enforcing strict @entity143 law , is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the @entity93 .			2

@entity0 is trying to encourage more women to join jihad with online guides
@entity151 videos on pink background *detail* ' feminine manual labour ' skills
include basic first aid , sewing , and cooking - with ' quick and simple ' recipes
there are thought to be two all - female brigades serving @entity0 in @entity97 city
