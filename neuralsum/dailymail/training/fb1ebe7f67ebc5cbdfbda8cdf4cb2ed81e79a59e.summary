with the new @entity1 season fast approaching , time is running out for managers everywhere to get their teams in order			1
with that in mind , @entity5 poses the biggest questions facing @entity10 's top clubs right now			2
@entity11 will @entity12 make one marquee signing with the £ 63m from the sale of @entity15 to @entity16 ? @entity11 have missed out on @entity18 striker @entity17 , who has signed a new five - year contract with the @entity21 giants			1
and @entity18 could also upset @entity12 by signing another of his targets , @entity24 hit - man @entity23			2
@entity25 misses from two yards in @entity26 friendly transfer : with @entity15 sold and @entity29 out injured , will @entity28 be enough for @entity11 ? @entity12 , though , is not panicking			1
he is happy with the business done so far this summer and is more concerned with group harmony that signing one big - name player			2
he will hold onto some of the spare cash until the january transfer window			2
of the new arrivals , much is expected of young @entity37 winger @entity28 , while £ 23m midfielder @entity29 will surely be influential once he shakes off a knee injury that will keep him out for the first few weeks of the season			2
@entity26 is @entity25 finally on his way out of @entity26 ? the striker was part of the full - strength squad which flew out to @entity44 on friday , but that should not be taken as a sign he has a long - term future at @entity48			1
@entity49 have been keen on the former @entity11 hit - man for a couple of years and now have the buying buyer of a new @entity54 billionaire			1
@entity55 and @entity56 also want the 30 - year - old @entity57			2
@entity26 boss @entity58 undoubtedly want shut , but @entity25 does not feel the time is right to leave			1
there have been reports of a bust - up between the pair at the end of last season , but @entity25 still wants to stay and fight in the hope of proving the @entity68 wrong			1
curtains : is it time for @entity25 ' ill - fated spell in west @entity72 to come to an end ? @entity74 will @entity74 get a defender good enough to return them to top four ? @entity77 maybe disappointed in his failed bid to sign @entity80 captain @entity79			1
the 28 - year - old defender has been cleared to leave @entity80 by @entity82 , but will move to @entity16 instead			1
on first inspection , that may seem a blow to @entity87 ’s hopes of firing @entity74 back among the @entity1 ’s front runners in his first seasons in charge			1
but the @entity91 has been more than impressed by what he has seen of the defenders already at @entity94 during @entity74 ’s pre-season tour of @entity96			2
they have responded to his change in tactics and jumped on board with his brutal new fitness regime			2
defence : after losing out on @entity79 , will @entity74 be strong enough at the back ? and , the transfer window has not closed yet			1
@entity87 may yet add @entity107 full - back @entity105 to his line - up and @entity111 centre - back @entity109			2
will @entity112 be the longest - running transfer saga never to happen ? there is every chance the midfielder will still be sitting in a barber ’s chair somewhere in @entity119 when @entity74 kick - off the new campaign at home to @entity123			0
@entity124 are desperate to sell the £ 45m - rated midfielder to help their cash - flow problems			0
but @entity74 are insisting no deal is on the cards			0
the @entity129 had an operation on his knee before the start of the @entity134 in @entity135 and it is believed @entity77 has fears over the 27 - year - old ’s long - term fitness			1
if a deal was done for a player who likes his hair trimmed a least once a week , @entity112 would likely become @entity74 ’s most expensive signing of all time			2
limbo : @entity112 's ongoing transfer saga has been a feature of @entity74 's summer @entity148 @entity149 have retained the @entity1 title by the time they finally sign @entity153 ? it ’s not quite “ @entity155 ? ” , but not far off			1
it appears @entity148 have been saying they are about to sign the @entity158 defender within the next 48 hours for the last 48 weeks			0
it ’s fast becoming a farce			0
and we thought those days were over at @entity148			0
the 23 - year - old @entity162 visited @entity163 last month to ratify the deal and the video footage of his trip was embarrassingly leaked on the club 's website			0
the hold - up is understood to be down to @entity149 and @entity158 ironing out the third party ownership of a the player			0
there is no truth in reports - yet - that @entity176 has been seen searching kit skips and looking behind lockers for the player valued at around £ 32m			0
champions : city are the @entity182 , but are desperate to add @entity183 to their side @entity80 will @entity82 rush to sign a defensive midfielder in the final weeks of the transfer window or go with @entity187 as holding player ? @entity82 has denied planning to use the @entity10 midfielder in a holding role for the season ahead , but could be fast running out of options			1
the @entity162 has dismissed reports linking him with a move for @entity18 ’s genuinely world - class @entity197 enforcer @entity196			0
and the @entity199 have yet to formally submit an offer to @entity202 ’s @entity201			0
@entity80 ’s move for @entity205 ’s @entity204 last week caught many by surprise and it has been suggested @entity82 is considering turning the young defender into exactly the sort of midfielder he wants to fill his gap			1
tussle : does @entity187 have what it takes to play as a holding midfielder , or should @entity82 spend again ? @entity216 expecting great season @entity218 will @entity219 finally get his hands on another striker or two before the drama starts all over again at @entity218 ? @entity219 has put bids in for four strikers , but actually only wants to sign two of them			1
@entity219 all over , maybe ? throw everything at it and hope something decent falls out ? @entity230 has been ruled out until sometime in november with an ankle injury sustained on the club ’s pre-season tour of @entity234			0
the absence of the club - record signing in the front line has left @entity219 in a desperate hunt before the @entity218 open with an all - @entity72 affair against @entity240			0
@entity218 have agreed a £ 3.5m fee with @entity242 for 24 - year - old @entity244 striker @entity243 but the personal terms are an issue			0
@entity219 could also set his sights on @entity80 ’s versatile @entity249 @entity248 and @entity74 ’s likely outcast @entity250			1
issues : @entity230 has been plagued by fitness problems since signing for @entity218 last summer @entity205 are @entity205 going to build a team that could avoid relegation ? after having the heart of their side ripped out by @entity11 and @entity74 , there is simply not enough time for new manager @entity261 to find the six or seven players needed to fully limit the damage			1
the signings of @entity119 target - man @entity265 and @entity37 midfielder @entity266 are a start , but it is hard to see how any club could service such a brutal dismantling of their squad and hope to survive in the top flight			0
difficult task : can @entity261 keep @entity205 up after they sold five of their best players @entity275 will @entity135 glamour - boy @entity276 give @entity277 the edge over the other relegation contenders ? @entity280 is never short of a big - name transfer target , or two			0
but @entity276 ? according to reports , the 34 - year - old is looking for a new club after his contract at @entity287 was terminated			0
it has been suggested @entity276 would be keen to link up with compatriot @entity289 at @entity277			0
all well and good , except the keeper is likely to be on his way if a del can be done over his wages			0
@entity276 , apparently , sees himself playing on for another eight years			0
the former @entity16 legend could do a job for newly - promoted @entity277 , but @entity280 is not fool enough to place @entity298 ’ survival hopes on his shoulders			1
@entity72 bound : could @entity280 pull off another coup and snag former @entity16 star @entity276 ? @entity301 will @entity301 ’ boss @entity302 finally land @entity304 defender @entity303 in time for the inevitable relegation battle ? the @entity304 have rejected a third bid from @entity301 for the former @entity10 under 21 international			1
@entity302 has made the 24 - year - old one of his top targets as he tried to build a squad capable of staying in the @entity1 , but will need to up his last offer of just over £ 2m			1
@entity301 , not surprisingly , are tipped by many to stop straight back into the @entity311			0
@entity302 was happy a squad which romped to automatic promotion last season , but he does not appear to have done enough business this summer to keep the @entity301 in the top flight			2
it could all go very wrong , very quickly			0
@entity304 : can @entity301 finally sign @entity304 defender @entity303 as @entity302 looks to strengthen defence click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			1

@entity1 season just one week away
@entity11 still have *n't* *replaced* @entity15
@entity77 dealt blow after @entity79 chooses @entity16
could @entity25 finally leave @entity26
@entity187 emerges as holding midfield option for @entity80
