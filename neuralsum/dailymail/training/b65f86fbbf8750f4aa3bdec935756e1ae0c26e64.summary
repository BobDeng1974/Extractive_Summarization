' @entity0 , however , did say that @entity4 's late night would not be the only reason for a @entity1 victory			1
' it is an advantage for the other team but it is not a decisive one , ' he explained			2
' if we think we are going to win that game because @entity4 arrive yesterday ( thursday ) night late , that is not the reason			1
we must play very good because they also have a strong squad			2
i do n’t think they will play the same starting 11			0
' @entity0 , who will become back @entity50 after he was suspended for tuesday night 's 2 - 1 @entity52 defeat at the hands of @entity54 , is relishing the chance to ramp up the pressure on @entity15			1

it was a very close game			0
we could n’t win for different reasons			0
