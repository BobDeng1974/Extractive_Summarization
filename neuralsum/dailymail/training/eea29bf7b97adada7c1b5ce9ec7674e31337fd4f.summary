by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:11 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:44 est , 19 december 2013 ' destructive force ' : culture secretary @entity4 has slammed @entity5 for involving hacked off in political negotiations on press regulation @entity4 has slammed @entity5 for involving the lobby group hacked off in political negotiations on press regulation , saying its presence had been a destructive force creating lasting damage			1
hacked off , which campaigns for state - imposed regulation of the @entity14 , was involved in late - night talks with representatives of the three main political parties in @entity5 leader @entity19 ’s commons office in march			1
the meeting resulted in the government unveiling its @entity22 to underpin a new press regulator			1
the presence of @entity25 and the exclusion of newspaper representatives led to universal rejection of the charter by publishers			2
mrs @entity4 , the @entity4 , was also forced to concede that protections against political interference in the regulation of the @entity14 could be swept away after the next election			1
she said a future government could vote to override a clause demanding that a two - thirds parliamentary majority be reached before any changes are made to a @entity22			1
mrs @entity4 told mps the presence of hacked off at the talks this year had been a ‘ hijacking of government business ’			1
‘ i assume the @entity5 invited them to that meeting ... it proved to be deeply unhelpful			2
we had been working very closely with [ deputy labour leader ] @entity48 prior to that point			0
@entity5 leader : hacked off was involved in late - night talks in march with representatives of the three main political parties in the @entity55 office of @entity19 ( pictured on monday in @entity56 , @entity57 ) ‘ we had extensive and exhaustive meetings over some months			1
i had thought we got to a position ... where i felt we had an effective system where we could take the @entity14 and public with us			1
’ she told mps on the @entity63 that the campaigners ’ presence ‘ became quite a destructive force in the perception of the press ’			0
she said : ‘ i think it made some lasting damage			0
we had managed to get to a stage where we were on the verge of agreement			0
some of the interventions over that weekend created a great deal of bad will			0
’ mrs @entity4 added that the presence of @entity81 off ‘ was n’t something the prime minister or i was willing to accept			0
it was a very difficult situation			0
‘ we were facing the very real probability of statutory press regulation			2
it was n’t something we felt was the right answer			0
it was absolutely philosophically the wrong thing to do			0
’ the culture secretary also addressed claims by mps that the so - called two - thirds safeguard against political interference was a ‘ parliamentary nonsense ’ that senior commons officials believe could be replaced or changed after the 2015 general election			1
talks : mrs @entity4 said that the presence of @entity25 was not something that she and prime minister @entity95 ( pictured last friday on an @entity97 train to @entity98 ) were ' willing to accept ' conservative @entity99 told the committee : ‘ the advice that i have had when i have gone to talk to very senior clerks is that the two - thirds is a parliamentary nonsense ; that no parliament can bind a successor parliament , and that if a successor parliament wanted to amend or change or bring in a different charter , they could do that by a simple majority			1
’ mrs @entity4 replied : ‘ the principle behind that provision was to very much ensure that the charter could not be changed simply on the whim of ministers who are @entity114 at the time			0
' we had managed to get to a stage where we were on the verge of agreement			0
some of the interventions over that weekend created a great deal of bad will ' culture secretary @entity4 ‘ of course a government can pass laws , and with a simple majority in the @entity126 can change anything it wants to change , but what i think we are doing in putting that provision in place is giving @entity131 a very clear ability to be able to press any government on why it might not adhere to that , and i think that is a really rather important thing to have been done			0
’ last month , mrs @entity4 indicated that the @entity22 could become redundant if the industry ’s new watchdog , the @entity136 , proved to be successful			2
asked if she had meant to make such a suggestion , mrs @entity4 told @entity87 it was not possible to mandate @entity14 involvement in a @entity22 process , ‘ otherwise you will be having statutory regulation ’			1
she added : ‘ i ’m very pleased indeed with the progress the @entity14 has been making in setting up @entity145 and the support that is being garnered within the industry for the approach that is being taken			2
