@entity0 : @entity1 was jailed for six years for causing grievous bodily harm a medical student was yesterday found guilty of her part in a plot that left a besotted admirer dead			1
the man , who she claimed had attempted to rape her , was lured to her home then beaten unconscious before being left to die in a burning car			1
@entity1 , 20 , decided to ‘ play @entity16 ’ when she recruited two men to carry out the fatal attack on @entity14 , who she claimed had attacked her six months earlier			1
the virgin told mr @entity18 she wanted ' closure ' and even reassured the wary businessman following a text from him asking : ' are we going to talk civil or do you want me dead ? ' after inviting her victim to her student home , he was kicked , punched and struck with a camera tripod , then put into the boot of his car			1
the vehicle was then driven to a quiet @entity32 side street and set alight			0
the post-mortem examination revealed mr @entity18 was still alive when the fire began			2
yesterday , @entity1 was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm for her role in the attack , and was warned by the judge it is ‘ virtually inevitable ’ that she will be given a long jail sentence			2
her two conspirators were also convicted of murder and manslaughter respectively			0
as the verdicts were read out , a woman had to be removed from court screaming uncontrollably			0
@entity47 and her victim were two young people with much in common – both devoutly religious , fiercely intelligent , and from solidly respectable @entity51 families who wanted the very best for their children			0
had events unfolded differently , mr @entity18 , a 21 - year - old entrepreneur who founded a global television station dedicated to the @entity51 community , could have had a stellar business career			2
@entity1 would by now have been more than halfway through her studies to become a doctor , well on her way to accomplishing her dream of saving lives			2
@entity63 : @entity64 ( left ) , and @entity65 ( right ) beat @entity14 unconscious before bundling him into a car boot and setting the vehicle alight tragically none of that is possible now			1
instead @entity1 , who used to work with disabled children , will soon be imprisoned			2
in a trial at the @entity73 lasting more than two months , jurors were told it was a revenge killing in retaliation for his attempted rape of @entity1 the year before			1
that attack was never reported to police so what really happened between them will never be known			0
' revenge ' : mr @entity18 was attacked by the two men at @entity1 's university home and driven away in a car that they set on fire what is known is that she lured @entity14 – gagan to his family – to his death in february last year by sending him a text saying she wanted to talk to him			1
so oblivious was he to her true motives that when he arrived at the home she shared in @entity97 with five fellow medical students , mr @entity18 was carrying a teddy bear and flowers as gifts for her			2
after inviting him in , she led him to her bedroom , where two male friends were lying in wait			0
one , @entity64 , 20 , was a fellow @entity51 who knew mr @entity18 but was infatuated with @entity1			1
the other was @entity64 ’s school friend , @entity65 , 20			1
as @entity1 ate @entity107 in the kitchen , the two thugs mercilessly beat mr @entity18 unconscious , then wrapped him in her duvet and placed him in the boot of his car			1
they then drove to @entity112 , south @entity32 , doused the @entity113 – and the victim – in petrol , and set it alight			0
within days @entity1 and her co-conspirators had been arrested and charged with murder			2
in court , @entity1 claimed she had n’t asked @entity64 , who was convicted of murder , and @entity65 , found guilty of manslaughter , to kill @entity89 but just give him ‘ a couple of slaps ’ to help him ‘ mend his ways ’			1
but speaking outside court yesterday , dci @entity124 , of @entity127 ’s homicide and serious crime command , said : ‘ her actions were calculating and she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy of tricking @entity14 to @entity97 to seriously assault him , which ultimately resulted in his death			2
‘ all this from a medical student , embarking on a career in the caring profession			0
i have no doubt that but for her actions , her deceit and trickery that night , @entity14 ’s death would not have happened			2
’ @entity1 and mr @entity18 met at a @entity51 festival in @entity146 in 2009 and the businessman was soon besotted with the pretty young student , although no romance developed			1
scene of death : @entity18 was driven to a quiet alley in @entity112 , south east @entity32 , where the car he was in was set alight and he was left to die but after his father was murdered while attending a wedding in the @entity157 , @entity158 , the pair became closer			1
@entity1 , an undergraduate at @entity97 spent hours , often long into the night , comforting him on the phone and chatting online			0
then , one evening in august 2010 , @entity89 spent the night with @entity1 at her student digs			0
both he and she were to refer to what happened between them that evening as attempted rape although , because of their strict moral and religious code , whether it was rape in the usual sense of the word is unclear			1
whatever happened between them , @entity1 felt profoundly betrayed afterwards and the friendship quickly soured			0
pretty : @entity1 , left , and @entity18 , right , met online in 2009 and the 21 - year - old man became infatuated with her she turned for solace to @entity64 , a trainee electrician who she had met through a martial arts course while still at school			1
‘ our theory is that he was jealous of the close bond between @entity89 and @entity1 and wanted to win her affections , ’ said a police source			2
‘ he was willing to do anything for her , even if it meant killing his old friend			0
’ @entity1 , meanwhile , was speaking to her housemates about securing ‘ justice ’ by exacting revenge on mr @entity18 and about her ‘ gangster friends ’			1
she turned to @entity64 for help and he roped in his friend @entity65 , a bicycle mechanic			1
in his closing speech , prosecutor @entity189 told jurors : ‘ for a group of youngsters to decide that they are the custodians of @entity51 virtue and play @entity16 on the subject of religious duty and moral obligation is a grotesque turn of events			0
’ last night mr @entity18 ’s sister @entity201 said she and her mother @entity203 were unhappy with the verdict			0
she said : ‘ we all feel that all of them were 100 per cent responsible for @entity89 ’s death			0
it was enormously hurtful to hear what @entity1 said about my brother but i never believed it and to be honest anyone who knows him knows the truth			0
’ his mother @entity216 said : ‘ when i first learnt of @entity14 ’s death i was completely and utterly broken			0
i could barely function on a day - to - day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on			0
‘ since @entity14 ’s death i feel like my heart is completely broken and taken away from me is my son and a source of joy in my day			0
’ @entity1 , of @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity64 , of @entity226 , and @entity65 , of @entity112 , will be sentenced on wednesday .			1

@entity1 wanted ' justice ' against @entity14 after ' attempted rape '
she recruited @entity64 and his friend @entity65 , who beat and tied up tv *executive*
pair then left @entity18 to die in boot of burning car last february
