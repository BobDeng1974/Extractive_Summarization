the battle for @entity1 took another twist on sunday night when it emerged that @entity4 financier @entity3 had submitted an £ 18million offer for a controlling stake			1
@entity3 , who owns the @entity8 basketball team , made his offer to plc chairman @entity10 in the days after @entity11			1
he wanted a general meeting called to approve the issue of new shares and was willing to spend a further £ 15m to buy up 100 per cent of the club			2
@entity4 financier @entity3 had submitted an £ 18million offer for a controlling stake in @entity1 however , the acquisitions made recently by @entity19 and a consortium comprising @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 – who now have around 34 per cent between them - have since altered the picture significantly			1
none of those wealthy fans would have any intention of selling as they seek to force regime change			0
while the initial format of his bid appears unlikely to succeed , @entity3 may still have a role to play as it is understood he would be willing to work alongside fan groups and @entity1 - supporting businessmen			1
the 52 - year - old chief executive of @entity38 is thought to have had some limited contact with the @entity21 consortium			0

‘ he is regarded as a straight - talking and very determined guy with a genuine passion for sport and an impressive record of success at the highest level of @entity4 sport and business			2
‘ of course , he sees this as an exciting opportunity to invest in a major sporting institution , but given his involvement in the @entity67 , he fully realises that , without the broad support of fans , any proposals are doomed to failure			0
’ at least 75 per cent of shareholders would have to agree to new shares being issued to a non-shareholder at a general meeting , after resolution nine was defeated at club ’s agm in december			0
as it stands , existing shareholders must be given first refusal on the available new shares , which could raise around £ 6.5m			0
the acquisitions made by @entity19 and the @entity84 give them a strong hand – and they could apply to buy up any shares not taken up when the issue goes ahead			0
second - placed @entity1 are 13 points adrift of @entity89 at the top of the @entity91			2
