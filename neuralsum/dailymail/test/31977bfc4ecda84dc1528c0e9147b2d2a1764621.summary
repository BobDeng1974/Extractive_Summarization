@entity0 hopes to lure more people to use its new @entity3 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they 're already using on @entity7 or @entity9 phones			1
the move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world 's biggest software company , which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones , partly because of a lack of apps			1
the company said at its annual build conference on wednesday that it will release new programming tools for software developers to rapidly adapt their @entity7 and @entity9 apps to run on devices that use the new @entity3 10 operating system coming late this year			1

@entity0 also announced a new name for the web browser that it plans to offer with @entity3 10			1
the company promises its new ' edge ' browser is faster and more useful than the internet explorer that @entity0 has offered for the last 20 years			1
the tech giant is making its case for @entity3 10 before an army of software developers who may be crucial allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm among consumers for the next version of @entity0 's flagship operating system , coming later this year			2
' our goal is to make @entity3 10 the most attractive development platform ever , ' @entity0 executive @entity66 told an audience of several thousand programmers and app developers			2
while @entity0 has already previewed some aspects of the new @entity3 , a parade of top executives is using the build conference to demonstrate more software features and app - building tools , with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as @entity81 ultimately , they 're hoping to win over people who have turned to smartphones and tablets that run on rival operating systems from @entity86 and @entity7			1
during the three - day conference , @entity0 is also expected to show off new @entity3 smartphones or other devices and reveal more details about such tech initiatives as the company 's new @entity93 web browser ; its @entity96 - like digital assistant known as @entity97 ; and the @entity98 , a futuristic ' augmented reality ' headset that projects three - dimensional images in a wearer 's field of vision			1
but perhaps most importantly , this year 's conference is an opportunity for @entity0 to persuade an audience of more than 5,000 techies and independent programmers that it 's worth their time to create new apps and programs for @entity3 10			1
experts say @entity0 needs a rich variety of apps if it wants to appeal to people who are increasingly using mobile gadgets instead of personal computers			1

internet explorer , which was first called @entity123 , was first released as part of the add - on package plus ! for @entity126 in 1995			1
internet explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers , attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003			0
however , it struggled in the face of competition , and in may 2012 it was announced that @entity86 's @entity134 overtook @entity123 as the most used browser worldwide			1
the brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of internet explorer 6 , which was notoriously insecure			0
' getting developer buy - in is absolutely the crucial thing , ' said @entity141 , a tech industry analyst at @entity143			0
he said @entity0 has struggled with a ' chicken - and - egg ' problem , in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for @entity3 because relatively few people use @entity3 phones and tablets			1
@entity0 hopes it has solved that problem by designing @entity3 10 so it 's easier for developers to build ' universal ' apps that work on a variety of @entity3 devices , from phones to pcs and other gadgets , @entity141 said			2
currently , there are more than 1.4 million apps for @entity9 phones and about the same for @entity7 devices , while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on @entity3 phones and tablets			1
the company also has a big carrot to wave in front of those developers : @entity0 has already said it will release @entity3 10 as a free upgrade to people who now have pcs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of @entity3 , provided they upgrade in the coming year			0
the offer could create a huge new audience of @entity3 10 users in a relatively short time , @entity141 said			0
@entity66 predicted there will be a billion devices using @entity3 10 - from pcs to phones , tablets , gaming consoles and even holographic computers - within the next two to three years			0
@entity0 has not said exactly when @entity3 10 is coming , and some analysts are hoping the company will announce a release date at the conference , along with details about how it will distribute future upgrades			0
ceo @entity33 and other executives have hinted they 'd like to move away from the old notion of selling each new version of @entity3 as a separate product			0
@entity0 's had early success in selling its office productivity software on a subscription basis , in which customers pay an annual fee to use programs like @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0

he has redesigned some of @entity0 's most popular programs for mobile devices and invested in new ' cloud - computing ' services , in which businesses pay to use software that 's housed in @entity0 's data centers			0
@entity0 still relies heavily on selling traditional software for pcs and corporate computer systems			0
but its latest quarterly earnings report , issued last week , offered some signs that the decline in that business is slowing , while @entity0 's cloud - computing business is growing rapidly			2
the news drove @entity0 's share price up 10 percent in one day			0
the stock has continued to rose , trading as high as $ 49.13 on wednesday - within a dollar of its 52 - week high .			0
