by @entity0 on sale : prized @entity3 beef , pictured , originally form @entity4 and known for its succulence , is to be sold at budget supermarket @entity7 budget chain @entity7 is bringing the world ’s most expensive beef to its aisles at £ 6.99 for a sirloin steak			1
the company has managed to get supplies of prized @entity3 beef , which originated in @entity4 and is renowned for its flavour and succulence			1
normally , luxury stores , gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye - watering £ 100 per kilo – putting it out of reach for most families			1
however , @entity7 will sell the @entity3 meat for around £ 25 a kilo , which works out at £ 6.99 for an eight ounce ( 227g ) rib - eye or sirloin steak			1
wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat , which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture			2
the cattle were initially introduced to @entity4 as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century			1
beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite , while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in @entity4 where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around			1
kobe beef is the purest , highest quality of the meat , which is produced from the black @entity51 - ushi breed of @entity3 cattle and raised according to strict tradition			1
however , the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe , including the @entity59			2
the @entity7 supplies , which go into stores on june 12 , have been imported from @entity62			1
managing director of corporate buying at @entity7 , @entity71 , said : ‘ at @entity7 our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products , and @entity3 is no exception			1
this summer , our shoppers are looking to buy the finest fresh meat , so the steaks fill a real gap in the market			0
’ the move to offer luxury food at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the ‘ big four ’ – @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 ’s and @entity86			2
the formula is clearly working , for new industry figures show annual sales at the no - frills @entity91 owned chain are rising at 35.9per cent a year , while rival @entity93 is seeing a 22.7per cent surge in sales			2
both are eating in to the market share of @entity83 , where sales are down by 3.1per cent , @entity86 , which has seen a fall of 3.9per cent , and @entity85 ’s			0
currently only @entity84 , which offers its own @entity59 wagyu beef at bargain prices and pursues a budget prices strategy , is managing to stem the tide of customers switching to cheaper rivals			2
the director of corporate buying at @entity7 said shoppers at the budget store ' love to try out specialist products '			1
annual sales at the no - frills chain are rising at a rate of 35.9 per cent a year , officials say the boss of @entity86 , @entity118 , has described the success of the budget chains as having the most profound effect on food shopping since the 1950s			2
he has responded by announcing a three year price cutting campaign that will reduce prices by £ 1billion , which has effectively forced all the other mainstream grocers to follow suit			0
the fierce price competition is delivering real benefits for families with figures from retail experts @entity133 putting grocery basket inflation at just 1.2per cent			0
grocery industry expert at @entity137 , @entity138 , said the rise of the budget chains is putting a brake on food price rises across the high street			0
he said : ‘ @entity93 achieved a record market share of 3.6per cent , accelerating with its highest ever year - on - year growth of 22.7per cent			0
similarly , @entity7 has gained 35.9per cent and retains its record 4.7per cent share			1
’ ‘ @entity83 , @entity85 ’s and @entity86 have all lost market share since this period last year , while @entity83 and @entity86 recorded sales drops of 3.1per cent and 3.9per cent respectively			0
’ the director general of the @entity150 , @entity151 , said food price inflation is at its lowest level since at least december 2006			0
‘ this is great news for hard - pressed households as the summer approaches , and confirms that retailers are responding to current conditions by matching attractive offers with those products most in demand at this time of the year , ’ she said			0
@entity162 , the head of retailer and business insight at @entity165 , said : ‘ food inflation is still low , many supermarkets are price cutting and non-food prices remain deflationary , so the high street continues to generate little inflationary pressure			0
‘ @entity173 in the way of immediate seasonal or weather related price increases is anticipated so the outlook for the next three months is for relatively stable shop price inflation			0
helped by the increases in consumer confidence since the start of the year , this should encourage shoppers to spend more freely over the summer months			0
