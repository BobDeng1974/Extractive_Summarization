by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:59 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 14:32 est , 5 august 2013 @entity3 have retained the ashes after rain ensured the third test against @entity7 ended in a draw at @entity9			1
@entity10 became an @entity4 - winning captain for the first time in anti-climactic circumstances after the @entity15 weather spared his side a final - day battle to avoid a defeat that would have kept the series alive			1
the tourists were in a commanding position , having removed @entity10 , @entity22 and @entity23 to reduce @entity3 to 37 - 3 in pursuit of an unlikely target of 332			1
@entity7 were given a glimmer of hope when play started at 11.30am - against all forecasted predictions - and they reduced a nervy @entity3 to 37 for three in 20.3 overs			1
the result gave @entity3 a 2 - 0 lead with two tests to play in the five - match series and ensures they will keep hold of the urn , as they triumphed in the past two series			1

' @entity76 congratulates @entity3 's cricketers @entity93 and @entity23 voice their delight at the win gone : @entity23 was next to go after edging behind to @entity96 as @entity3 reached lunch at 35 for three debate : @entity23 reviewed the decision and @entity100 showed no mark on his bat evidence : the original decision was upheld and @entity105 appeared to show a faint edge outraged : @entity23 was far from happy as he left the field following his dismissal @entity23 said : ' wow ! what a feeling ' , while @entity93 tweeted : ' we have retained the @entity4 and it feels magnificent ! ! ! ' @entity3 had to survive a brief scare , though , after their top order was dismissed in the 90 minutes of play before lunch			1
@entity10 was trapped lbw without scoring before @entity22 and @entity23 followed him back to the pavilion after offering catches to wicketkeeper @entity96			2
the weather then started to close in , and after just three balls of the afternoon session , the rain forced the players off for good at 2pm			0
for @entity7 the draw , which ended a run of six @entity124 defeats , meant their earliest concession of the ashes in a series since 1929			1
