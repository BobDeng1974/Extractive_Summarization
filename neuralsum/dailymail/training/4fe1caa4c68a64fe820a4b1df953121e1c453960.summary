by @entity0 @entity1 , secretary of state for work and pensions , has been tasked with finding significant cuts to the pension bill ministers are looking at privatising the state pension as part of a drive to cut costs , it emerged last night			1
@entity1 ’s department have been told they could save significant sums by contracting a private firm to issue the 4.5million pension statements every year in the @entity15 and abroad			1
the plan is contained in a leaked copy of the @entity18 , which is marked ‘ restricted ’ which discusses how to meet a target to shave a third off its budget			2
the department is the biggest in @entity24 and issues nearly £ 100billion of public money to millions of pensioners every year			1
it faces an ‘ unprecedented reform challenge ’ the review states			2
mr @entity1 will have his operational budget slashed by 34pc to £ 6.3bn by 2016 from £ 9bn in 2009 - 10			1
almost £ 2bn of those savings will need to be made in the next two financial years			1
but the pensions expert @entity34 said she was seriously concerned by the idea that firms such as @entity37 , @entity38 or @entity39 could be brought in to administer public money to millions of pensioners			1
an 80 - page review , seen by @entity43 states that opportunities to make major savings ‘ are limited ... as much of the low hanging fruit has already gone			0
’ it says the department has already made savings and ‘ to deliver anything greater , they would need to ‘ to look more fundamentally at how it delivers its business , and consider some more strategic shifts			0
’ currently the government runs ten pension centres around the country including in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , which employ 7,000 staff			1
@entity63 's @entity62 , said 93 per cent of pensioners were satisfied or very satisfied with the current model			0
file picture pensions expert @entity34 said she was seriously concerned by the idea that a firm like @entity39 , which bungled security for the @entity70 , could be brought in			1
file picture miss @entity72 said a private firm would save money by reducing the pay and conditions of staff or the quality of the service , and charges could go up in the end			0
‘ we ’re dealing with a vulnerable group and a massive number of people , so i would be seriously concerned about outsourcing a service like this , which is working well , with a view that it might make some short - term savings ’ , she said			2
the chair of the @entity91 work and pensions committee , @entity63 ’s @entity62 , said she would not want to see the service tendered out to private companies and pointed out that 93 per cent of pensioners were satisfied or very satisfied with the current model			0
‘ the pension service is one of the success stories of the @entity100			2
there is a very high satisfaction rate and very few complaints about it			0
[ so ] if it ’s a success story and it ai n’t broke i ’m not sure why they would want to upset that			0
if you end up with a poorer service as a result then it ’s not good value for the taxpayer ’ , she said .			0

firms like @entity39 could be *drafted* in to issue pension statements
