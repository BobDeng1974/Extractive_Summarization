by @entity0 gypsy the puppy underwent emergency surgery after swallowing the spoon when her owner left it out she ’s only seven months old , so naturally gypsy the @entity8 still has plenty of life lessons to learn			1
first up ? the difference between food and a spoon , as the astonishing @entity15 image on the left shows			2
@entity17 had to have life - saving emergency surgery after swallowing a spoon her owner , @entity20 , had left on the kitchen worktop while she went upstairs			1
' the pot in which i kept all the teabags had been tipped over , so i thought at first she had eaten a teabag , ' said ms @entity20			2
' it was then i noticed the spoon was missing from the pot. i do get the odd senior moments , but i knew it was in there before			1
' i looked everywhere for it , under the bed , in the dish washing bowl , outside and in @entity17 ’s bed			0
' @entity36 seemed fine , but i began to wonder whether she could have swallowed it			2
' ms @entity20 was due to take another one of her six dogs to the vet so decided to bring @entity36 along for a once - over			1
after seeing the spoon in @entity44 's stomach during an x-ray , vets quickly rushed the puppy off for an emergency operation			1
' the vet joked he had heard of the saying ' born with a silver spoon in their mouth ' but not going the other way , ' said ms @entity20			1
' she needed an emergency operation , as it could have ended in serious problems			0
' there was a risk of infection			0
at the time , you do have horror thoughts through your head , but i did trust the vets			0
' vet @entity63 who performed the procedure added : ' the spoon had worked its way through her stomach and into her intestines			2
vets discovered the spoon while giving the seven - month - old dog an x-ray @entity36 could have been at risk of death if vets were n't able to retrieve the spoon when they did ' if we had not operated straight away , there would have been a high risk of it perforating the intestine , which could have been fatal			1
' we ’ve taken all kinds of foreign objects out of dogs , but this is the first time we have had to remove a piece of cutlery			0
' according to her owner , @entity36 is prone to bringing strange objects in from the garden			0
' you never know what she is going to bring in when she comes through the dog flap			0
' to be honest , there is n’t much more i can do to stop her getting things , apart from hanging items off hooks off the ceiling			0
i try to push things to the back , so she ca n’t get to them			0
' since having surgery @entity36 has made a full recovery and is ' full of beans ' again			2
the puppy has made a full recovery according to owner @entity20 ( pictured )			1
