@entity1 batsman @entity0 benefited from a huge stroke of luck in wednesday 's @entity5 match against the @entity6			1
@entity6 fast bowler @entity7 delivered a terrific ball that raced through the defences of @entity10 and clipped the off stump			1
however the left - hander was handed a staggering reprieve when the bails shuffled from their groove and landed back in place			0
@entity0 is bowled by survives as the bails fall back in their groove and do not fall off law 30 ( @entity18 ) 1			1
out bowled ( a ) the striker is out bowled if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler , not being a no ball , even if it first touches his bat or person			0
law 28 ( the wicket is down ) 1			0
@entity27 put down ( a ) the wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps , or a stump is struck out of the ground , ( i ) by the ball , or ( ii ) by the striker â€™s bat if he is holding it or by any part of his bat that he is holding the electronic red bail light signalling contact had lit up when the white ball struck the outside of the black stump , but @entity10 could not be given out and the former @entity47 batsman was handed a second life			2
that was a major relief for @entity1 , who at the time were 35 for one in pursuit of a 277 victory target			2
to add insult to injury , @entity10 drove the next ball from @entity7 down the ground for a boundary			1
earlier , @entity6 batsman @entity59 cracked 106 from 83 balls to lead a recovery from 131 for six , resulting in a team total of 276 for nine			0
@entity10 had another stroke of luck when spinner @entity65 failed to grip on to a caught - and - bowled chance			2
but his run of fortune ran out in the 19th over when @entity7 finally had his man			0
@entity10 has his off stump hit by the ball but the bail fails to come off replays show how the stumps lit up on impact from the ball - but the bails did not fall off @entity7 bowls to @entity10 and and sees the ball clip the off stump and the bail go up in the air @entity10 looks back to see he has survived despite the ball hitting the stumps having reached 37 , @entity10 drove outside off stump but snicked the ball to wicketkeeper @entity87			1
it looked like a significant blow to @entity1 , who fell to 72 for two , having earlier lost @entity91 for just three runs in the second over .			0
