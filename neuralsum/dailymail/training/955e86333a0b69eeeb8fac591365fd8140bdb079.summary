a judge was told the 2010 deal , worth up to £ 20million , was allowed to proceed to avoid ‘ major embarrassment ’ to chancellor @entity13 and the tax authorities after the bank became ‘ aggressive ’ and allegedly made threats			1
@entity2 asked mr @entity17 , sitting in @entity18 , to declare that @entity7 's decision to let the deal go through was legally flawed and involved a breach of statutory duty			1
defeat : campaign group @entity2 today lost its @entity4 ( pictured ) challenge over the legality of the ' sweetheart ' tax deal between @entity7 and @entity8 the judge ruled the deal was ‘ not a glorious episode in the history of the revenue ’ but it was not unlawful			1
tax authority lawyers defended the settlement , saying it was among five big business deals declared ‘ reasonable ’ by a 2012 report of the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			0
@entity2 says it is wrong to allow rich companies to avoid paying millions in tax while the government imposes tough austerity measures on the poor and ordinary taxpayers are pursued for every penny			1
@entity44 , a director of @entity2 , said after today 's hearing that he was disappointed with the ruling			2
evidence : a judge was told the 2010 deal , worth up to £ 20million , was allowed to proceed to avoid ' major embarrassment ' to chancellor @entity13 ( pictured yesterday ) and the tax authorities but he added : ‘ this case has shown that the government 's tough talk on tax is just that - talk not substance			1
’ defeat : @entity44 , the director of @entity2 , outside the @entity4 in @entity18 today @entity59 , then permanent secretary for tax , initially shook hands on the @entity8 deal on november 19 2010 following a long - running dispute over national insurance contribution payments dating back to the 1990s			1
lawyers for @entity2 put before the @entity4 in @entity18 an email and a witness statement they submitted showed that mr @entity59 overruled legal advice , the @entity7 's own guidelines and its internal review board to ensure the deal went ahead			1
just over a week after the handshake , the revenue 's high - risk corporate management board attempted to block the deal , just as the chancellor announced that the top 15 banks in the country had signed up to a new code of conduct related to tax			1
an email from mr @entity59 on december 7 2010 described how @entity8 allegedly ‘ went off the deep end ’ after the board decision and threatened to withdraw from the government 's bank code of practice , first published in december 2009			2
the email warned : ‘ the risks here are major embarrassment to the @entity90 ( chancellor of the exchequer ) , @entity7 , the @entity92 ( the large business service of the @entity7 ) , you and me , not least if @entity8 withdraw from the code			1
’ the witness statement from mr @entity59 , who retired as head of tax last summer following strong criticism of the @entity8 deal from the public accounts committee , said the bank withdrawing from the code ‘ would have embarrassed the chancellor ’			2
base : @entity105 , appearing for @entity7 ( whose @entity18 headquarters are pictured ) , accused @entity2 of taking legal action ' to pursue politics by other means ' @entity110 , appearing for @entity2 , argued that the deal breached @entity7 's statutory duties , and an ‘ aggressive ’ bank had been ‘ rewarded ’ for several years of failing to pay tax it owed , causing ‘ real disquiet among the taxpaying public ’			1
in his judgment , the judge , mr @entity17 , said @entity119 taken into account ‘ the potential embarrassment to the chancellor of the exchequer if @entity8 were to withdraw from the tax code ’ when he decided to approve the @entity8 settlement			2
the judge said : ‘ @entity7 accepts that was an irrelevant consideration and should not have featured in his decision - making process			1
’ but ‘ maladministration and illegality ’ were separate issues , said the judge , and the settlement itself was not unlawful			2
the judge listed other mistakes made by the revenue as he observed : ‘ the settlement with @entity8 was not a glorious episode in the history of the revenue			0
‘ the @entity7 officials who negotiated it had not been briefed by the lawyers who were litigating against @entity8			2
‘ they relied on their belief or recollection that there was a barrier to the recovery of interest on the unpaid national insurance contributions ( @entity147 )			0
‘ @entity7 accepts now that there was no such barrier			0
the officials who negotiated the agreement overlooked the need for approval from the @entity155 in relation to an agreement over £ 100 million			0
‘ @entity7 now accepts that they should have appreciated this			0
because the officials did not have this requirement to mind , they said nothing about it to @entity8 and created the impression that the agreement was a done deal by the end of the meeting on 19th november			0
‘ @entity7 accepts that was an error			0
furthermore , @entity7 did not appear to have taken a contemporaneous note as to the agreement which was reached on 19th november			0
‘ that allowed a degree of uncertainty to prevail for a time as to what precisely had been agreed			0
‘ in the end that has been resolved but in the course of the hearing , @entity7 accepted that it would have been a good idea for a contemporaneous record to have been kept			0
’ she said the exact amount lost to the revenue was not known but was at least £ 5million to £ 10million , and the @entity183 had received evidence that it could be up to £ 20 million			0
@entity105 , appearing for @entity7 , accused @entity2 of taking legal action ‘ to pursue politics by other means ’			1
@entity7 said in a press statement : ‘ large business tax settlements are a vital part of how @entity7 secures tax revenues for the country and without them @entity194 's public finances would be seriously damaged			0
’ @entity196 , campaigns director of @entity2 , said : ‘ obviously , while we are deeply disappointed that this deal has not been declared unlawful , the judge 's ruling that top @entity7 officials played politics with major tax deals to protect ( @entity17 ) @entity13 's reputation is a major victory in exposing the truth behind these secret deals			1
‘ despite not having won the case today , we still feel that this judgment has demonstrated that the government is making a political choice to cut legal aid , public services and the welfare system , rather than take action to make corporate giants ... pay their fair share of tax			0
‘ this case has exposed the lengths the government will go to to look tough on tax avoidance and has been vital in holding the government to account for its shameful actions			0
’ solicitor @entity224 , of law firm @entity225 , which represented @entity2 , said : ‘ this is a disappointing decision but it has been an extremely important case to fight			1
it has forced @entity7 to reveal the process by which it reached a deal with @entity8 , a settlement which let the bank off an estimated £ 20 million tax owed			1
‘ without this legal action @entity7 would have succeeded in keeping secret the fact that the settlement was in part motivated by saving the blushes of the chancellor rather than collecting the tax due to the public purse			2
‘ we hope through this litigation that @entity7 has learnt from its mistakes in the past and will ensure that such sweetheart deals , like that reached with @entity8 , do not happen in the future			0
’ @entity249 , @entity7 's director - general for business tax , welcomed the ruling			2
‘ the @entity4 's comprehensive dismissal of @entity2 's claim puts to rest the fallacy that @entity7 is soft on large businesses , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity7 has an exemplary record in relentlessly challenging those who avoid tax			2
we have recovered £ 34 billion in additional revenues from large businesses in the last seven years			0
bank : @entity59 , then permanent secretary for tax , initially shook hands on the @entity8 deal on november 19 2010 following a long - running dispute over national insurance contribution payments ‘ the @entity4 's judgment confirms what @entity7 has always said : that while we made errors in settling the @entity8 dispute , we made the right settlement in the circumstances , and that our decision was both proper and lawful			1
' the @entity4 's comprehensive dismissal of @entity2 's claim puts to rest the fallacy that @entity7 is soft on large businesses ' @entity249 , @entity7 director - general for business tax ‘ this issue has been rigorously and repeatedly scrutinised - by the @entity183 , by a retired high court judge on behalf of the @entity37 and now by the @entity4 itself			1
‘ the public can have confidence in our governance processes , which we have strengthened , providing greater levels of scrutiny , transparency and role separation			0
‘ in its definitive judgment , the @entity4 has now drawn a line under the @entity8 issue			0
‘ @entity7 can now get on with the critical job of working to ensure that all individuals and companies , big and small , pay the tax they owe to fund the @entity194 's essential public services			0
