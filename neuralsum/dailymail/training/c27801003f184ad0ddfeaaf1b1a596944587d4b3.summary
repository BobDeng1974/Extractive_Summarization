by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 says @entity3 have to find a place for @entity5 in their test side immediately as the wicketkeeper is a ' game changer '			1
@entity5 scored the fastest one - day international century by an @entity10 at @entity11 on saturday but is down the pecking order for a test spot			1
however @entity2 , in a @entity15 conversation with @entity16 and former @entity3 captain @entity17 , said : ' he has to play now ! talent like that needs to play on the international stage ... game changer ! ' @entity22 kisses his helmet after scoring @entity3 's fastest ever one - day century @entity2 was responding after @entity16 suggested examples of @entity26 keepers who were thrust into the test side : ' @entity29 not finished article when they played @entity32			1
@entity5 / @entity35 outstanding prospects # vision instead of ' englishness '			2
' and @entity17 replied : ' @entity37 ... only in @entity3 do we look at what can go wrong rather than what could go right ' before @entity2 had his say			2
one of the few people with any doubt , it seems , is @entity5 himself			2
he said after the ton against @entity48 : ' i am not ready for test match cricket			1
' it is a pretty easy assumption to make , looking at my game and where i am as a player			0
' that is my honest opinion , and that is the opinion of others			0
' @entity57 is set to return for the @entity32 against @entity48 and @entity5 believes he has work to do in front and behind the stumps to become the @entity63 man 's long - term successor - but that is his plan nonetheless			1
' it is my hope and ambition to turn into someone who is talked about as a test cricketer as quickly as i can			0
on fire : the wicketkeeper - batsmen smashed his way to 121 from only 74 balls ' i average 32 in first - class cricket - and if i was n't playing one - day cricket , i would not be at the forefront of anyone 's mind with an average like that			0
' my glovework needs to improve too , to be a test match cricketer			0
' and @entity3 captain @entity85 added : ‘ @entity86 has certainly found his method in one - day cricket			0
but he ’s yet to find the tempo he needs in first - class cricket and i think he would agree he needs more time to do that			0
he will go on to have an outstanding career in test cricket but , to be honest , i do n’t think he ’s ready for that now			1
’ @entity22 has his sights firmly set on @entity57 's place in the test side one day star : but @entity22 knows he needs to improve his game to make the transition to the test side			2

@entity2 , @entity103 and @entity17 say @entity5 should play tests
@entity5 scored fastest odi ton by an @entity10 at @entity11 vs @entity48
@entity2 *insists* @entity5 ' has to play now ! '
@entity57 set to return for @entity109 against @entity48
@entity5 does not think he is ready to play test cricket
