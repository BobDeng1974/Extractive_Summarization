intelligence sources have now revealed that it appears the attack happened by chance and was not pre-planned			0
it is believed that the deadly assault came about following the protests at the @entity17 in @entity18			0
questions : @entity2 faces renewed pressure over his administration 's handling of the attack on the @entity8 @entity24 in @entity7 ' right now , there is nâ€™t any intelligence that the attackers pre-planned their assault days or weeks in advance , ' a @entity8 intelligence official told @entity31			1
the source added that attackers may have seized the opportunity to attack the @entity8 @entity24 in @entity7 following the violence in @entity18			2
it is the latest development on the deadly attack on september 11 after it was revealed that @entity8 drones were in the skies above the @entity8 consulate in @entity7			2
defense department officials considered sending troops in to rescue the ambassador and staff , according to @entity45 , but ultimately decided not to			2
they would haven been able to watch the attack on - screen as it unfolded			0
it also emerged last week that @entity8 ambassador @entity9 repeatedly pleaded with the @entity50 to ramp up his security team in libya - requests that the @entity53 ultimately denied			1
@entity9 warned the @entity50 of a ' security vacuum ' in @entity55 ' that is being exploited by independent actors ' in one cable that described rapidly deteriorating security conditions			1
' islamic extremists are able to attack the @entity60 with impunity , ' he wrote			0
' what we have seen are not random crimes of opportunity but rather targeted discriminate attacks			0
' deadly : four @entity8 , including ambassador @entity9 , died in the attack on the @entity8 @entity24 in @entity7 @entity9 said the attackers would not be deterred ' until authorities are at least as capable			1
' just hours before his death , he sent the @entity53 a cable describing ' expanding @entity73 influence in @entity74 , ' a town east of @entity7 , and said he was seeing a ' troubling increase in violence and @entity73 influence			0
' @entity9 recapped a meeting in which the commander of @entity7 's @entity81 told him there is ' growing frustration with police and security forces			1
' the cables were released by @entity87 rep. @entity87 of @entity88 , the chairman of the @entity8 @entity89 , which is investigating the security matters surrounding @entity9 ' death and questioning whether the @entity50 could have prevented the deadly attack			1
less than three weeks ahead of the presidential election , republicans are using the cables to attack president @entity2 on his foreign policy , despite the @entity50 's claim that it was solely responsible for the decisions to deny @entity9 ' requests for more security in @entity55			1
' these critical foreign policy decisions are not made by low or mid-level career officials -- they are typically made through a structured and well - reasoned process that includes the @entity105 and the @entity106 , ' @entity87 wrote in a letter to @entity2 on friday			2
killed : ambassador @entity9 ( left ) died following smoke inhalation , while agent @entity109 ( right ) died in a desperate battle heroic : former @entity111 ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack the letter claims that @entity2 had a political motivation in rejecting @entity9 ' security requests , since the president was eager to show improving conditions in @entity55 after the @entity8 - led international operation that toppled @entity55 dictator @entity120			1
on august 2 , six weeks before @entity9 was killed , he requested ' protective detail bodyguard ' positions , calling the security situation in @entity55 ' unpredictable , volatile and violent			1
' a month earlier , he requested that the @entity50 extend his tour of duty personnel , which is a 16 - man temporary security team trained in combating terrorism			1
the request was denied and the security team left 8 august			1
@entity9 had asked for the security team to stay through mid-september			1
colonel @entity130 , the leader of the security team that left @entity55 in the weeks before the terror attack , told @entity45 that @entity9 fought hard against losing the team			1
' it was quite a degree of frustration on their part , ' he said			0
' they were -- i guess you could say -- clenched - fist over the whole issue			0
questions : in their debate on tuesday , president @entity2 and @entity148 challenger @entity147 argued over when @entity2 first said it was a terror attack the @entity106 maintained publicly for a week that the attack on the @entity8 consulate in @entity55 was a spontaneous mob upset about an anti-islam video , even though it has now been revealed that they were informed within 24 hours of the attack that it was planned and carried out by militants			1
' your administration has not been straightforward with the @entity8 people in the aftermath of the attack , ' @entity87 wrote in his letter to @entity2			1
in his @entity163 address the morning after the killings , @entity2 said , ' no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for			2
' but @entity148 say he was speaking generally and did n't specifically call the @entity7 attack a terror attack until weeks later , with the president and other key members of his administration referring at first to the @entity179 movie circulating on the internet as a precipitating event			2
last week , the @entity50 said that it never believed the 11 september attack on the @entity8 consulate was the result of a protest over an anti-islam movie , contradicting previous statements			1
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours the @entity106 now says the attack probably was carried out by an @entity201 - linked group , with no public demonstration beforehand			0
secretary of state @entity203 blamed the ' fog of war ' for the early conflicting accounts			0
@entity87 's committee questioned @entity50 officials for hours about what @entity148 lawmakers said was lax security at the consulate , given the growth of extremist @entity214 militants in @entity215			1
congressional aides are hoping to use @entity9 ' cables and information from @entity50 testimonies to build a timeline of what the intelligence community knew , compared to what the @entity106 was telling the public about the attack			1
that could give @entity147 ammunition to use in his foreign policy debate with @entity2 on monday night			2
reports have revealed that the @entity231 station chief in @entity55 compiled an intelligence briefing from eyewitnesses within 24 hours of the assault on the consulate that indicated militants launched the violence			0
the briefing from the station chief was written late wednesday , 12 september and reached intelligence agencies in @entity242 the next day , intelligence officials said			0
yet on saturday of that week , briefing points sent by the @entity231 to @entity244 said ' demonstrations in @entity7 were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity17 in @entity18 and evolved into a direct assault			0
' haven : ambassador @entity9 and @entity109 were hiding in a safe room which later filled with diesel smoke the briefing points , obtained by the @entity252 , added : ' there are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations ' but did not mention eyewitness accounts that blamed militants alone			1
such raw intelligence reports by the @entity231 on the ground would normally be sent first to analysts at the headquarters in @entity263 , @entity264 , for vetting and comparing against other intelligence derived from eavesdropping drones and satellite images			0
only then would such intelligence generally be shared with the @entity106 and later , @entity244 , a process that can take hours , or days if the intelligence is coming only from one or two sources who may or may not be trusted			0
@entity8 intelligence officials say in this case the delay was due in part to the time it took to analyze various conflicting accounts			2
one official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to discuss the incident publicly , explained that ' it was clear a group of people gathered that evening ' in @entity7 , but that the early question was ' whether extremists took over a crowd or they were the crowd			0
' but that explanation has been met with concern in @entity244			0
flames , grenades and gunfire : a burnt - out car in front of the @entity8 consulate ' the early sense from the intelligence community differs from what we are hearing now , ' @entity300 rep. @entity299 said			2
' it ended up being pretty far afield , so we want to figure out why ... though we do n't want to deter the intelligence community from sharing their best first impressions ' after such events in the future			0
' the intelligence briefings we got a week to 10 days after were consistent with what the administration was saying , ' said rep. @entity313 , a member of the @entity315 committees			2
@entity313 would not confirm the existence of the early @entity231 report but voiced skepticism over how sure intelligence officials , including cia director @entity320 , seemed of their original account when they briefed lawmakers on @entity323			0
' how could they be so certain immediately after such events , i just do n't know , ' he said			0
' that raises suspicions that there was political motivation			0

@entity8 ambassador @entity9 repeatedly pleaded with the @entity50 for *additional* security personnel
@entity148 say the @entity2 administration denied the request for political reasons
