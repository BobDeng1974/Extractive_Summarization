fad diets are so last year as more and more brits turn their backs on quick - fix solutions			0
the @entity5 , the @entity6 and the @entity7 diets look set to be kicked to the curb in 2015			1
but while 91 per cent of @entity12 vow to eat healthier this year , half will quit in just three months , a @entity10 survey revealed			2
healthy eating plans : 91 % of @entity12 vow to eat healthier this year but half will give up in just three months while we all want to maintain our figures and lead a healthy lifestyle , boredom and not being able to eat favourite meals are reasons why we give up on diets @entity22 diets mimic the types and quantities of foods our hunter - gatherer ancestors ate			1
pastured and wild meat , seafood , nuts , seeds , eggs , plenty of fresh vegetables and small seasonal amounts of fruit feature heavily			2
the basic premise of the @entity6 diet is that this way of eating suits our genetics , which have hardly changed in the last 10,000 years			1
it is said to be much better than the grains , dairy , and processed foods that have arisen since the agricultural revolution			0
the main reason for giving up on the diets is boredom and not being able to go without their favourite meals , 71 per cent of survey respondents said			0
despite 50 per cent of the population quitting their @entity54 diets after just 90 days , 91 per cent said they will try their hardest to make healthier food choices part of a routine which can be maintained for more than just the month of january			0
although eating less is no longer the trend , one place consumers are cutting back is on their meat intake			1

more than one third of the consumers who took part in the poll deliberately cut the amount of meat they eat ' people are wise to alternative protein sources and the long term benefits that these offer when it comes to overall health and weight control as part of a balanced diet			1
' women do not seem as bothered about their meat intake as just 27 per cent have said they will cut down , although 60 per cent of men are trying to eat less			2

the poll was commissioned by meat - alternative brand , @entity99			0
fad diets like @entity6 ( left ) and the cabbage soup will soon be a thing of the past , the survey indicated ms @entity71 added : ' it 's clear that fad diets just are n't sustainable and people who attempt them may see short term benefits , but suffer long term disappointment at the results as well as potential health issues			1
' a sustainable diet should allow you to eat your favourite meals , but in as healthy a way as possible			0
that way you 're less likely to fail at the first hurdle			0
' eating healthily in 2015 should not be difficult or boring			0

@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 diet no longer in fashion with @entity122
boredom and not eating what we want are reasons why we we quit
