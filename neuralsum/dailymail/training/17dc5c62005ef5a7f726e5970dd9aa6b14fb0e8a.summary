by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 18:59 est , 1 march 2013 @entity3 's bloated aid and climate change ministries have gone on a multi-million - pound recruitment spree since the last election			0
the @entity6 , which dishes out overseas aid , has employed in excess of 150 extra members of staff at a cost of more than £ 10million a year			1
and despite @entity14 ’s austerity drive , the government has found the money to take on an extra 264 staff at the @entity17 , with the roll call soaring by more than a quarter since 2010			1
big spender : the @entity6 ( pictured ) has employed over 150 extra members of staff at a cost of over £ 10million a year their profligacy comes while other @entity24 ministries have had to make drastic cuts to bring down the deficit , leading to frontline services being slashed			1
both the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) and the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) said their staff numbers had to rise so quickly to meet government ‘ targets ’			1
at @entity17 , the total has increased by 26 per cent from 1,022 in april 2010 – just before the last election – to 1,286 in april last year , official figures released following a parliamentary question reveal			1
the increase is even more startling when compared to april 2009 when just 768 were employed at the department			2
since the election , @entity6 has swelled its ranks by 10 per cent			1
the 1,619 members of staff in december 2010 had increased to 1,773 by december 2012			1
figures released in the @entity41 last week show that in 2010/11 , the total cost of @entity6 ’s staff bill was £ 93.4million			1
the expected 2012/13 figure will be around £ 104.1million			2
@entity45 ( pictured ) obtained the figures and spoke up for families in the @entity3 who are making sacrifices the news will outrage @entity45 backbenchers who have called on the government to scrap its pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national output on overseas aid , and abandon its obsession with wind power			2
@entity45 , the @entity45 mp who obtained the figures following parliamentary questions , said : ‘ families up and down the country making sacrifices and having their living standards squeezed will be astonished to see low priority government departments spending their hard - earned taxes on more staff			1
‘ the civil service needs to become more efficient and effective at deploying the resources it has			0
during these tough economic times government departments should be leading the way by reducing their sizes not taking taxpayers for granted and bringing in more bureaucrats			2
’ three other departments – work and @entity74 , the @entity72 and @entity73 – have also seen staff rises , although this is because staff from abolished quangos went to work for the core department			2
critics said that if an organisation was worthy of abolition , its jobs should go too – otherwise people would believe the ‘ bonfire of the quangos ’ was little more than a damp squib			0
a spokesman for @entity6 said that its extra staff were not bureaucrats sitting in @entity24 but people working on the frontline in poor countries			1
she added : ‘ @entity6 has cut 30 per cent from its admin budget			1
since 2010 the department has undergone major restructuring involving recruitment of additional frontline staff to make sure our development programmes are delivered efficiently as we reach the 0.7 per cent target			0
’ a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ @entity17 has a challenging and important agenda , and the posts that have been filled are necessary to enable us to meet those targets			1
’ a @entity72 spokesman said that overall , the number of civil servants across @entity24 stands at 420,000 – a post-war low and down 15 per cent since the election			0
concerns : @entity111 aid to @entity113 will be funnelled through charities rather than the country ’s scandal - hit government , @entity111 said yesterday			0
the international development secretary said the @entity3 will give £ 16million to @entity113 , after earlier halting the aid because of the @entity121 state ’s support for brutal rebels in the neighbouring @entity123 ( @entity123 )			0
the money will not be paid directly to the @entity113 treasury as initially planned but instead to aid agencies in the country			0
the announcement comes six months after @entity130 ’s predecessor , @entity129 , reinstated payments to the @entity113 government despite growing human rights concerns			0
on his last day in the job he authorised £ 8million as direct support to the government , and diverted the other half to specific development programmes			1
he acted despite a @entity140 report last july highlighting @entity113 ’s role in backing insurgents in @entity123			0
miss @entity111 decided in november to withhold the money amid renewed concerns about @entity113 president @entity146 ’s actions			0
violence in @entity123 has been spiralling , with reports of summary executions being carried out by the rebel @entity150			0
miss @entity111 said £ 16million would now be paid in to @entity113 but not through its government			2
some of the cash will also be paid into a ringfenced fund which will be divided among the country ’s poorest workers			0
miss @entity111 said money would provide work opportunities for 545,000 , support essential services , fund 1.8million school books and help 20,000 refugees in camps on the @entity113 side of the border with @entity123 .			0
