a rare insight into @entity2 's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club			0
the man who spent six years as spokesman for the @entity8 family has written an enlightening account of his time with the @entity2 chiefs			1
@entity13 's book , ' the @entity14 : six years speaking for @entity2 's silent owners ' , challenges popular perception about the @entity18 bosses who succeeded in a debt - burdening £ 800m takeover in 2005			1
but across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the @entity60 - based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt , revealing a previously unseen human side			2
@entity13 , who uses an anti-glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book , states that the family were ' completely unruffled ' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by @entity33 's sons			1
' hundreds of angry protestors ( surrounded by a heavy police presence ) were filmed chanting ' @entity78 , die ! ' he says , as the brothers made a hasty exit			0
but they were back to speak to staff the following day			0
sir @entity45 shares a joke with @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity8 ( @entity26 ) in june , 2005 a young @entity2 fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 fa cup final against @entity85 ' they seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night 's events , ' @entity13 adds			1
@entity13 reveals that the @entity29 were huge fans of @entity45 and never considered sacking him , speaking of a close relationship between the @entity89 and the @entity18 and revealing that @entity45 ritually invited them into the dressing room			1
' the @entity8 brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with sir @entity45 and the players in their dressing room , ' he reflects			1
' a post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game			0
' following his own first meeting with the owners , in their plush @entity102 office suites , @entity13 states : ' the @entity29 were not ogres – on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth , close - knit family			1
he adds : ' it was ' abundantly clear they were in it for the long - term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence			1
' in 2010 , with @entity113 sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of @entity115 to @entity116 for £ 80m , @entity13 recalls how he made a panicked call to @entity24 when he saw @entity2 legend @entity118 pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the @entity120 following @entity2 's @entity122 win over @entity123 , for whom he was playing at the time			2
the scarves , in the colours of @entity2 's original founders @entity129 , were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but @entity8 , who was watching on tv in @entity60 , appeared unconcerned			2
' my adrenaline pumping , i immediately grabbed my @entity135 , scrolled through my address book to ' jg ' and pressed the green icon , ' @entity13 writes , adding that he was petrified @entity118 would become the poster boy of the protestors			2
' we do n't know @entity118 's motives for putting on the scarf , ' he says @entity8 told him			0
' also i 'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad			0
' football is a passionate business			0
wo n't it blow over ? @entity13 claims that the @entity29 did not sell @entity115 to @entity116 without @entity45 's approval @entity33 , pictured in 2003 , left his sons to complete the takeover , according to @entity13 ' sure , some fans are angry and protesting inside @entity27			1
but from where i 'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round			0
they 're supporters of @entity2 too			0
i get that some fans do n't like us , but to hate us , it 's such a strong word			0
to hate us when the club has been so successful , it 's extraordinary			0
' @entity13 adds that @entity24 became obsessed with football ( and never called it soccer ) thanks to an @entity166 , @entity168 - supporting room - mate he had while at college			1
aside from the family itself , the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club 's staff			0
@entity13 recalls how a furious striker @entity177 , who would soon leave for @entity116 , reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 @entity180 final thumping of @entity181			0
' he contemptuously ripped his token winners ' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room , sweeping angrily past me as he did so , ' he reveals			2
@entity13 exposes the lengthy celebrations after the @entity190 victory over @entity40 in @entity191 , recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel			0
' at around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made - to - order omelettes for their ravenous guests , ' he writes			0
' while we ate , @entity198 and sir @entity45 gave touching speeches , interrupted frequently by loud cheering , everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion			1
' @entity25 and @entity24 ( @entity26 ) watch @entity2 take on @entity205 at @entity27 earlier this season the green and gold protests by @entity2 fans left the @entity8 family ' completely unruffled ' , according to @entity13 @entity13 adds that @entity45 cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot - out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs			1
' sir @entity45 , ' he writes , ' beaming like the @entity215 , was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate , inside of which was the @entity122 trophy			1
' he adds that @entity45 even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment , saying simply : ' oh dear , why have you gone and done that , lad ? ' @entity13 says that the club felt a ' palpable sense of injustice ' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open - top bus journey through @entity231 after booze - fuelled @entity233 fans had rioted in the city during their @entity236 defeat earlier that season			1
the author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to @entity244 , where he inadvertently tripped up @entity45 with his suitcase in a @entity247 airport			0
' i immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was , in fact , sir @entity45 himself who had become entangled with my case , ' he writes			1
' horrified , i was immediately seized with fear and remorse			0
i apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare ; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving			0
' @entity13 dismisses suggestions @entity116 went over @entity45 and @entity259 's heads to do the @entity115 deal			2
united fans burn a @entity33 dummy during a protest outside @entity27 in may , 2005 he adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners ' after a long spell of soul searching by manager sir @entity45 , would accept this '			1
@entity13 says that in 2010 , with a rumoured bid from the @entity42 ( a group of well - off @entity2 - supporting businessmen ) reportedly in the offing , the @entity29 commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters ' attitudes towards them as well as the @entity42 and were pleased with the results			1
he reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming			0
@entity13 reserves fierce criticism for @entity286 's now - infamous 2010 interview in which he stated @entity259 had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about @entity2 's ' ability to attract the top players in the world '			2
' it was a crudely - disguised dig at the @entity29 ' ownership , ' he writes , before adding that @entity24 had spoken to @entity286 by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered			2
@entity13 , who was left out of the loop on the @entity286 situation , sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with @entity55 , his fate was sealed with a ' generous golden handshake '			2
@entity13 's book , ' the @entity14 : six years speaking for @entity2 's silent owners ' , is available on @entity307 .			1
