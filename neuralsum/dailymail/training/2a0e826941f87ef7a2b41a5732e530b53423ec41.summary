angry @entity1 manager @entity0 claimed champions @entity2 should have had two men sent off by referee @entity5 in a feisty evening game at the @entity7			1
city defender @entity8 left @entity9 with bad bruising on his back after a high and dangerous kung - fu style kick and later on @entity14 's boot was even higher when he caught @entity15 on the forehead as they challenged for the ball soon after @entity19 had controversially given @entity2 a 24th - minute lead from the penalty spot			1
@entity0 , who was also unhappy that @entity22 had been penalised for a challenge on @entity24 for the spot - kick , said : ' i do n't like players being sent off but when you get a referee who gives a penalty to the letter of the law , @entity8 is a red card every time			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 shows his frustration on the sideline at the @entity7 ' the ball is clearly headed away by @entity9 , it is not 50 - 50 , and @entity8 's foot and knee are high in an unnatural position			1
it is violent conduct and @entity9 has a strong mark where he was kicked			1
' @entity14 is more unfortunate , he is challenging for the ball but it is a high boot			1
if he does n't touch the head of @entity15 , it is a yellow card			1
but if he does touch it , which he did , it is a red			0
' @entity0 was also critical of the penalty award which led to the only goal of the game			1
he said : ' to say i am disappointed is an understatement			0
the penalty should not have been allowed at all			2
@entity8 left @entity9 with bad bruising on his back after a high and dangerous kung - fu style kick ' there was clear contact , which is something that is allowed			1
it is a ball that is played into the 18 - yard box , and the defender is allowed to challenge			0
' @entity24 changes direction and @entity22 carries on with his run , he ca n't disappear , so there is going to be a coming together			0
there was nothing below the waste , everything is hip and shoulder			0
' @entity24 gets up immediately and fights for the ball which says it all			0
he was not even asking for a penalty			2
if it is a shoulder to shoulder , it is part of the game and should n't be penalised			0
' @entity14 goes in with a high foot on @entity1 's @entity15 during the game at the @entity7 @entity0 also complained the referee made his decision too hastily			1
' i am more disappointed with the way it was given so quickly			0
it was an instant reaction and a very disappointing decision			2
' the @entity91 's frustrated was increased when he thought @entity92 made a similar challenge on @entity94 by the halfway line and was n't punished			2
' it 's inconsistency , ' he fumed			2
@entity24 ( right ) goes down in the @entity1 penalty area after a challenge from @entity22 @entity1 are stuck in 11th place in the table , some way below expectations , but @entity0 said : ' there was n't very much between the two teams			1
when the penalty was given , our confidence left us			1
but i have never come to @entity2 before and they have had only three shots on target			2
' he has decided not to take his complaints about mr @entity5 's decisions any further â€“ believing it would be a waste of time			0
' when you are young and inexperienced , you want to fight the world and put it right , ' he said			0
' it is better for me to focus on my team and work on how they respond to bad decisions			0
you realise as you get older you will get good and bad decisions			0
so i really look forward to the second half of the season because it will be so easy to win games			0
' @entity128 here to @entity131 's facebook page			0
@entity2 's @entity19 gives his side the lead from the penalty spot as the champions go 1 - 0 up			1

@entity8 left @entity9 with bad bruising on his back
@entity2 's @entity14 caught @entity15 with another high tackle
@entity0 was also unhappy with penalty decision in first half
