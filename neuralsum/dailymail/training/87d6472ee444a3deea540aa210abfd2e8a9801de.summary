by @entity0 @entity2 brand boots have been accused of ripping off their @entity2 customers as their @entity5 products can be bought for a fraction of the price in the @entity8 many of the products in the company 's popular beauty range costs £ 10 less from the @entity8 store @entity13 than is charged by boots in their @entity2 stores and online			1
for example , the @entity17 & @entity18 costs £ 23 from boots while from @entity13 , it is available for $ 20.99 ( £ 12.47 )			1
boots was founded in the @entity2 when @entity28 opened his first store in 1849 in @entity30 selling herbal remedies			2
it opened its 1,000th store in 1933 followed by the @entity5 cosmetics range two years later			0
over the decades , boots have remained a trusted and popular store on the @entity2 @entity38 - there are now 1,112 health and beauty stores nationwide and 65 flagship stores and its headquarters remain in @entity30			2
its modern range of @entity47 anti-ageing skincare has won awards and is in demand following proven results in consumer testing and clinical trials			0
but one @entity2 beauty blogger said ' it 's a kick in the teeth ' that products from such a historic @entity2 brand are more expensive for @entity2 consumers			1
@entity59 , who writes the blog @entity61 , said : ' this drives me mad ! it 's the case with so many beauty products and brands unfortunately ; i went to @entity67 recently and went on something of a large beauty spree			0
part of this was because i was so eager to pick up products that are n't yet available here but a lot of it was to do with the fact that everything was so much cheaper over there			0
price difference : the @entity5 serum is £ 24.95 online and in @entity2 stores , left , while at @entity13 it 's $ 24.99 ( £ 14.85 ) saving : the @entity82 is £ 23 in the @entity2 , left , and £ 10 cheaper at @entity13 at $ 20.99 ' @entity8 drugstores have brilliant deals that mean you can pick up products for a fraction of the price that you can here			1
' @entity98 to say it can make you feel a bit frustrated at times and when a @entity2 brand seems to favour its @entity8 consumers over beauty lovers from its home nation , it 's a bit of a kick in the teeth			1
' @entity101 , who writes the beauty blog @entity103 , agreed			0
she told the @entity104 : ' i 'm incredibly disappointed to learn that a @entity2 brand with so much history is offering their products at much cheaper prices outside the @entity2			1
i 've come to believe that because @entity24 develop and retail all their own products that they 're offered at the most affordable price point , cutting out the usual margins that retailers take			0
' however , this has fundamentally lead me to question the brand 's ethos and pricing structure - there 's such a massive difference in price from the @entity2 to the @entity8 that it makes you wonder how this is even possible ? or why they 're willing to offer their products at a much cheaper price point , which will no doubt have a negative impact on their brands perception and position in the long - term			1
' it appears that @entity2 consumers are getting a hard deal , when we 've been the ones supporting @entity5 from its inception			2
' home grown : founded in @entity30 , boots have been a presence on the @entity2 @entity38 for more than a century meanwhile , @entity140 , who writes the lifestyle blog @entity142 , said : ' i always expect price variations with currency changes and so on , but for a brand that in my eyes does n't do a whole lot throughout the year through offers and promotions on their products , it 's a bit disappointing that @entity2 customers do n't benefit from savings , even occasional ones , especially from leading products like their serums			1
' a @entity160 spokesperson told the @entity104 : ' at @entity160 we know our customers want the best quality products at affordable prices			0
which is why we offer our @entity2 customers great value in lots of ways that we know you really appreciate			2
' we offer benefits through our @entity172 , which gives you 4 points for every £ 1 you spend , as well as regular promotions , including 3 for 2 across lots of your favourite products and customised coupons , throughout the year			1
you can visit @entity180 to find out our latest prices and offers			0
' @entity13 bought a 45 per cent stake in @entity160 owner @entity24 for 6.7 billion dollars ( £ 4 billion ) in 2012 and it was announced today that they will form a partnership with the @entity8 retailer under the company name @entity188			1
despite the partnership , the boots headquarters will remain in @entity30			0
bargains : dozens of beauty products are cheaper in @entity13 stores than in the @entity2 boots are n't the only company who are charging more for their beauty products in the @entity2			1
brands such as @entity199 and @entity200 can be bought for less on the otherside of the @entity202			0
and it 's not just on beauty products that @entity205 are getting a bad deal			0
yesterday , the @entity207 reported how @entity209 company @entity208 are charging @entity2 buyers more than consumers in the @entity8 and @entity212 for its products			2
and last month it emerged that @entity2 shoppers were paying hundreds of pounds more for tvs , computers and tablets compared to @entity8 consumers			2
research by which ? discovered that a top - of - the - range @entity223 costs £ 755 more in the @entity2 than in the @entity8			1
an @entity226 13in laptop was £ 355 more expensive here , while the @entity229 and @entity230 games consoles cost £ 95 more when they were bought in @entity2 .			0
