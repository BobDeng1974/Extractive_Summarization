by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:28 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 6 august 2013 the @entity3 psychiatrist who faces the death penalty for the 2009 shooting rampage at @entity6 has told jurors that ' the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter '			1
@entity10 on tuesday began his court martial delivering his own opening statements that lasted less than two minutes			1
he told jurors : ' the evidence presented during the trial will only show one side			0
' ' we the @entity18 are imperfect @entity19 trying to establish the perfect religion in the land of the supreme god			0
the dead bodies will show that war is an ugly thing ' admitted shooter : @entity10 , seen here in 2010 , is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on @entity39 base in 2009 @entity10 said ' the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter			1
the dead bodies will show that war is an ugly thing			0
' @entity10 's shocking opening statement came after prosecutors revealed that he had planned to ' kill as many soldiers as he could '			1
prosecutors teased the fact that @entity10 picked the date of the attack — november 5 , 2009 — for a specific reason but left the packed courtroom waiting for an explanation			1
col. @entity53 gave his opening statement at the @entity56 base , which was under heavy security at the trial got underway tuesday morning			2
the trial will turn into a faceoff between the gunman and his victims since the suspect is representing himself and will be tasked with questioning his former peers who were once his targets			2
@entity10 has never denied carrying out the attack , and the facts of the case are mostly settled			1
on the witness stand will be many of the more than 30 people who were wounded , plus dozens of others who were inside the post 's @entity74 , where some service members were preparing to deploy to @entity77			1
high security : all cars are being checked for explosives as @entity6 is operating under extreme caution during the trial reeling : the 2009 attack was the deadliest mass shooting ever on a @entity86 military installation they said they saw @entity10 shout ' allahu akbar ! ' — @entity91 for ' @entity92 is great ! ' — and open fire on unarmed fellow soldiers			1
@entity10 is charged with numerous counts of murder and attempted murder for the attack that left 13 people dead			1
-- staff sgt. @entity99 , who is expected to be called to testify as a witness to the attack over the next several weeks , he is expected to deliver an opening statement , to question witnesses and possibly present his own evidence , but questions abound about how the trial will play out given his role in both the attack and the trial			2
how will @entity10 question his victims ? how will victims respond ? how will his health hold up ? @entity10 , who was shot in the back by officers responding to the attack , is now paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair			1
he requires 15 - to 20 - minute stretching breaks about every four hours , and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores			0
staff sgt. @entity122 , who was wounded , is expected to testify			0
he said he looked forward to seeing @entity10 , in a way			1
' i 'm not going to dread anything			0
that 's a sign of fear , ' @entity122 said			0
connected : the government has said that @entity10 , a @entity86 - born @entity19 , had sent more than a dozen emails starting in december 2008 to @entity130 , a radical @entity86 - born @entity131 cleric killed by a drone strike in @entity133 ' that man strikes no fear in my heart			1
he strikes no fear in my family			0
what he did to me was bad			0
but the biggest mistake that he made was i survived			0
so he will see me again			0
' but staff sgt. @entity99 said he dreaded the expected confrontation			0
' i have to keep my composure and not go after the guy , ' said @entity99 , a mental health specialist who was preparing to deploy to @entity77 with @entity10			1
' i 'm not afraid of him , obviously			0
he 's a paralyzed guy in a wheelchair , but it 's sickening that he 's still living and breathing			2
' the judge , col. @entity149 , told jurors to prepare for a trial that could last several months			2
on tuesday , guards stood watch with long assault rifles outside the courthouse			0
a long row of shipping freight containers , stacked three high , created a fence around the building , which was almost entirely hidden by 15 - foot - tall stacks of heavy , shock - absorbing barriers that extend to the roofline			0
@entity10 's defense strategy remains unclear			1
he wanted to argue that he carried out the shooting in ' defense of others ' — namely members of the @entity169 fighting in @entity77 — but @entity149 , the judge , denied that strategy			1
clear wounds : retired staff sgt. @entity122 was one of the three dozen injured in the attack , seen here pointing to one of his wounds			2
he is expected to testify in the trial still standing : @entity3 staff sgt. @entity99 , who still carries two bullets from the shooting in his body , is seen holding a picture from the memorial that was dedicated to the 13 people who died the government has said that @entity10 , a @entity86 - born @entity19 , had sent more than a dozen emails starting in december 2008 to @entity130 , a radical @entity86 - born @entity131 cleric killed by a drone strike in @entity133 in 2011			1
@entity187 , @entity10 's former lead attorney , said monday that he still keeps in touch with @entity10 but was n't sure what he would say tuesday , if anything			1
@entity10 has indicated recently that he still wants his views to be heard			1
he has released statements to media outlets about his views on the @entity131 legal code known as @entity196 and how it conflicts with @entity86 democracy			0
if he is convicted and sentenced to death , it will most likely be decades before he makes it to the death chamber , if at all			2
the military has not executed an active - duty soldier since 1961			0
five men are on the military death row at @entity207 , @entity208 , but none is close to an execution date			2
different circumstances : @entity10 requires 15 - to 20 - minute stretching breaks about every four hours , and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores authorities in the military justice system have also struggled to avoid reversed sentences on appeal			1
eleven of the 16 death sentences handed down by military juries in the last 30 years have been overturned , according to an academic study and court records			2
that 's one reason why prosecutors and the military judge have been careful leading up to trial , said @entity228 , a professor at the @entity229 and former military lawyer			2
' the public looks and says , “ this is an obviously guilty defendant			0
what 's so hard about this ? ” ' @entity228 said			0
' what seems so simple is in fact relatively complicated			0

maj. @entity10 is charged with killing 13 people in november 2009 shooting rampage inside @entity39 base
was working as an @entity3 psychiatrist but had been *communicating* with a radical cleric in @entity133 for a year before the shooting
@entity10 , now paralyzed after being shot in the back by first responders during the attack , will be representing himself without the help of a lawyer
judge already ruled that he could not say he opened fire ' in defense of others ' , as he argued that he was saving the @entity169 in @entity77
he now faces the death penalty
