the @entity0 could need an extra £ 8billion over the next five years from the government to fill a black hole in its budget			1
it now receives about £ 110billion a year , an amount which has been ring - fenced from the public spending cuts that have hit other @entity8 departments over the past five years			1
a report on how to save money by reducing hospital admissions states that under a worst case scenario the @entity0 will have a deficit of £ 30billion a year by 2020/21			1
budget black hole : a report on how to save money by reducing hospital admissions states that under a worst case scenario the @entity0 will have a deficit of £ 30billion a year by 2020/21 this is because of the ever - increasing costs of caring for an ageing population , coping with rising obesity rates and paying for more expensive new drugs			1
@entity25 , chief executive of the hospital regulator monitor , said the @entity0 budget would need to increase by at least an additional 1.5 per cent excluding inflation			1
this would amount to £ 1.6billion extra – but mr @entity25 said it would probably need even more to cover the costs of the changes recommended by the report			2
in addition , the @entity0 would need to make unprecedented ‘ efficiency ’ savings to its own budget of between 2 and 3 per cent a year			1
this could lead to further rationing of treatments such as cataracts and hip and knee replacements and cuts to frontline staff			0
@entity0 @entity47 chief : @entity48 ( pictured ) wants to avoid patients having to go to hospital wherever possible by improving health services closer to home over the past five years it has been making annual savings of just 1 per cent – and these have resulted in heavy cutbacks			1
measures suggested in the money - saving report include : firms should reward staff with @entity61 , cash prizes or vouchers for losing weight , according to the head of the @entity0			2
@entity48 says stopping patients becoming ill in the first place – chiefly by tackling obesity – will save money			1
he is also urging bosses to hold @entity72 sessions and lunchtime running clubs for staff			0
in return , the employers would receive @entity78 tax breaks			2
‘ we ’re going to absolutely have to up our game across the board in terms of prevention and public health , ’ said mr @entity48			1
‘ the large increase in obesity is associated in large rise in diabetes and we are now spending £ 10billion a year treating diabetes			2
’ mr @entity48 lost nearly three stone thanks to a weight - loss incentive scheme at his previous job , the @entity94 insurance firm @entity95			2
his report also includes plans to recruit an army of volunteers to help feed elderly dementia patients in hospital or care for them in their own homes			1
the @entity103 have promised that if they remain in power following next year ’s election they will continue to ring - fence the @entity0 budget , but not necessarily increase it			1
labour meanwhile have said they will increase it by £ 2.5billion a year on top of inflation – although that money will not arrive until 2017			2
@entity113 , the party ’s leader , last month announced that the funding would be raised by a mansion tax , revenue from tobacco firms and cracking down on tax avoidance			0
but he later conceded that these would all require legalisation before they could be implemented and the money would take at least two years to come through			0
his claims that the money would be spent on more nurses have also been questioned by those who point out that the @entity0 is already billions in debt			2
@entity48 , the @entity0 chief behind the report , said today that pay freezes are not the solution			1
he told @entity132 's today programme : ‘ @entity0 staff have made a huge sacrifice during this period of global economic recession and austerity			0
' over the next five years , the same is not going to continue to be successful			0
‘ we are going to have to fundamentally change the way care is organised			0
‘ a pay freeze is not an option			1
we will have to compete with pay rates across the rest of the continent if we are going to attract the best , most committed staff			0
’ ‘ we have actually had big increases in the number of skilled health professionals working in the @entity0 in the last 15 years			2
‘ we know that there are real pressures - people are working incredibly hard , that ’s why we have got to change			0
’ despite fears of increasing privatisation , he also insisted that the ' vast majority ' of health services would continue to be delivered by the @entity0 in the future , but added it was ultimately the patient 's choice			1
‘ most health services are delivered in this country by the @entity0 , ' he said			1
' that ’s bound to continue to be the case under any foreseeable future			1
the test is we should think like a patient , and act like a taxpayer			0
’ 94 pence in every pound is going to @entity0 providers			0
it is not the case that all work is going to private companies			0
‘ i think that the vast majority of services will continue to be delivered by the @entity0			1
but ultimately patients are the people that should make the choice			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s an important debate , but it ’s not the main debate			0
there are much bigger issues – we are growing as a population , the kinds of diseases we are now responding to is very different from 20 years ago			0
‘ my commitment is to the @entity0			0
it ’s where my career started			0
if i did n’t fundamentally believe in the values of the @entity0 , i certainly would n’t have taken in this job in what i ’m sure most people will agree is a difficult time			0
' i ’m actually very optimistic			0
' mr @entity48 wants to avoid patients having to go to hospital wherever possible by improving health services closer to home			1
he said : ‘ there are big changes to the way in which care is going to be provided and that is going to take national and local efforts			0
‘ the @entity0 is now at a crossroads – as a country we need to decide which way to go			2
‘ it is perfectly possible to improve and sustain the @entity0 over the next five years in a way that the public and the patients want			1

@entity0 now receives £ 110bn a year , ring - fenced from public spending cuts
