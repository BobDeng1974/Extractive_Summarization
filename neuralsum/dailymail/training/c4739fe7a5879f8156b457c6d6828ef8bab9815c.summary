killed : @entity0 died from methadone poisoning after drinking from a @entity3 beaker in which the drug was being stored a father has been convicted of killing his two - year - old daughter after she was poisoned to death drinking methadone which was being stored in her @entity3 beaker			1
@entity0 was left to collapse under the effects of the heroin substitute several hours after an eye witness said she looked ' groggy ' and was falling over , a court heard			1
paramedics rushed to the family home in @entity15 , @entity16 , but despite attempting to revive her , @entity0 was pronounced dead in hospital just 35 minutes later			1
tests later showed @entity0 had traces of four separate drugs in her hair - with three of her dummies containing traces of cocaine			0
methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink			0
a jury was told how @entity0 's parents @entity28 , 41 , and @entity30 , 29 , were both drug addicts and the methadone had been prescribed to @entity30			1
but she had been keeping it in her daughter 's beaker and @entity35 bottles with a view to selling it on to fund her drug habit			2
both parents are now facing jail after @entity28 was found guilty by a jury of manslaughter at @entity44 - with @entity30 having already admitted manslaughter and a further charge of child cruelty			1
while @entity0 was in hospital the couple tried to cover up the tragedy by hiding the beaker and @entity35 bottles , the court was told			2
@entity30 sent two text messages to @entity28 relating to the child 's drinking cup - one reading ' all the meth bottles out back under green thing '			1
another said ' do n't tip meth out hide it '			0
before @entity28 's conviction was secured , an earlier trial , which was abandoned , was opened by prosecutor @entity64			2
he told @entity44 : ' @entity0 died because she was exposed to the drugs as a result of the carelessness and negligence of her parents			1
' both defendants take drugs every day smoking heroin and crack cocaine			0
the methadone was in a child 's drinking cup - a @entity3 drinking cup			1
the toddler 's parents @entity30 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) allegedly knew she was unwell and tried to cover up the fact she had ingested methadone before police searched their home , the court heard storage : the drug - addict couple kept heroin substitute methadone in the @entity88 and @entity89 beaker , pictured in the run - up to the tragedy , a neighbour said he had often heard arguing between the adults and @entity0 , pictured , would cry for a very long time without being attended to ' @entity30 as a registered user of heroin was prescribed methadone as part of a drug treatment programme			1
' her prescription was for two 60ml bottles on a monday and wednesday and three on a friday			0
' the 4th of march was a tuesday , simple arithmetic tells you there ought not to have been 146 ml of methadone in the house or anything like it			0
' ' @entity30 's supply ought to have been low			2
but we have evidence that instead of taking it herself was keeping it and selling it to other drug users and using the money she made to buy heroin and cocaine for herself and @entity28			1
' we say they showed complete disregard for the health of the child			0
' prosecution point to the gross negligence of storing such a drug in a child 's @entity3 drink beaker - something that we submit @entity28 must have known was going on and failing to keep it out of harms reach from a child only two years of age and failing to seek medical help for @entity0 until it was too late			1
a relative told the court that @entity0 was unsteady on her feet before her death , and that they had heard @entity30 say that @entity0 was acting weird and @entity28 telling his partner ' i hope you 've not left the top off your tablets ' ' @entity0 , after a scientific analysis of her hair , was found to be exposed to methadone , heroin , cocaine and diazepam which she had in some way ingested over a period of several months			1
' in the run - up to the tragedy , a neighbour said he had often heard arguing between the adults and @entity0 would cry for a very long time without being attended to			0
@entity30 would keep the methadone upstairs and would bring it down in a bottle with a lid on so a user could drink it and then hand it back			2
on march 4 @entity30 sent several text messages to one drug user reminding her that she owed her Â£ 25			1
she had also gone to buy crack cocaine before returning home			0
a relative saw @entity0 fall on two occasions and noticed that she was unsteady on her feet			0
@entity30 was heard to say that @entity0 was acting weird - with @entity28 responding with : ' i hope you 've not left the top off your tablets '			1
heroin addict , @entity30 , was selling her prescribed dosage of methadone to other addicts when her child died , the court heard the couple were told to call an ambulance but they lied about taking @entity0 to a walk in centre and instead suggested the child had drunk some cider			1
eventually at 11.40pm , @entity28 calmly called 999 saying his daughter had stopped breathing			2
an ambulance arrived three minutes after the call and found him in the lounge performing cpr on @entity0 following directions being given over the phone			2
vomit was visible in @entity0 's hair , face , chest and on the floor and appeared to contain blood			1
at the house @entity28 told police that his mother and her boyfriend had been at the house and had brought with them a bottle of cider			2
he told them that after he left he could smell cider on the sofa where @entity0 was sleeping and noticed that her bottom half was wet before noticing she was not breathing			0
mr @entity211 said that this had been a lie and had been part of a ' joint cover up ' between himself and @entity30 who had been holding back seeking medical attention in the hope @entity0 would sleep off the effects of the methadone			1
shocking : tests showed @entity0 had traces of four separate drugs in her hair - with three of her dummies containing traces of cocaine ( pictured above , the family 's home in @entity15 ) ' it is the prosecution 's case that the defendants knew that they were at fault and as the afternoon wore on @entity0 failed to come round , they must have known , ' he added			1
' prior to the 999 call made at 11:40 there had also been an attempt to clear the house of incriminating evidence			0
' the child 's drinking cup with methadone and had been put under a sheet in the back yard of the house , bins with shoot bottles in have been moved outside from the back of the house to the end of the street away from their house			0
' the neighbour noticed that the water running the upstairs sink for significant period of time			0
' the prosecution submit it must have been a joint attempt by both defendants to clear up the house			0
' they were acting together to clear the house of any incriminating evidence they were both aware she had been put into a deep slumber had not woken up - they needed to protect themselves			0
police found a large number of @entity35 bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside			0
there were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins ' it is significant there were no phone calls for a period of one hour between 10:45 and the 999 call at 11:40			0
in the context of the usual use of phone it was an unusual silent			0
' when police searched the house they found hidden under a green cover in the back yard 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint and the @entity3 beaker			2
police found a large number of @entity35 bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside			0
there were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins			0
tests showed @entity0 's cause of her death was inhalation of stomach contents and poisoning by methadone			1
when he was arrested and interviewed under caution @entity28 maintained @entity0 may have drank cider and had become a little bit sleepy before falling asleep on his knee			2
both will be sentenced on december 1 .			1
