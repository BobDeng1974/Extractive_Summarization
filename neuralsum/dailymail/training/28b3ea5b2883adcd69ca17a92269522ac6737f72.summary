whenever @entity1 lose we always blame them and say they are rubbish but when they win we can be reluctant to give them full credit and instead say that the opposition are terrible			1
the truth here lies somewhere in between			2
yes , @entity8 were awful but that was because of how good @entity1 ’s seam attack were , in particular @entity12 and @entity11			1
that was as hard as batting gets in test cricket because @entity1 ’s big two have been phenomenal			1
lord ’s was almost like a light - bulb moment for @entity1			1
it was as low as they could get			0
sometimes you need to hit rock bottom before you can hit back and it was so bad after the second test that @entity1 ’s senior players seemed to say ‘ we might as well just go out and enjoy it now and see what happens			1
many people , myself included , doubted @entity34 and rightly so because i have always believed there was a lot of potential in this new @entity1 side and outside it with the likes of @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and something must have been wrong for them to go 10 test matches without a victory			1
so for @entity34 to have a good long look at himself and turn things around shows the incredible mental toughness of the man			1
a lot of people would have said ‘ enough ’s enough , i will just go back and bat ’ which is what i wanted because his runs have always been so important to @entity1			1
instead he has proved us all wrong			0
now he must remember why things have changed and what he and @entity1 have done to reverse their fortunes			1
so many of the things he did wrong have disappeared in the last three games			0
the field placings to tail - enders , putting everybody on the boundary for @entity75 , not bowling @entity76 for hours on end , over-bowling @entity12 so he was exhausted			2
@entity34 has changed but he needed to because he was being tactically naïve			1
winners : @entity1 celebrate after winning the @entity79 against @entity8 at @entity80 to have the clarity of thought to change when you are so low shows that this is a special guy			1
@entity85 has had a bit of luck along the way but he has deserved that after all he has been through for nine months			0
he ’s a good guy who has only ever done what he felt was best for the health of @entity92 cricket			0
@entity93 still needs to be done on his batting			0
there was evidence of the problems he has had over the last year in the way he got out on saturday			0
but he is getting there with the runs he has scored both here and in @entity104			0
@entity105 has proved the right coach for this @entity1 team , too			1
he was the right man , after @entity108 ’s , to question people and challenge them			2
important factor : @entity105 has had to pick his players up after a disappointing spell video coach @entity105 praises ' outstanding ' @entity1 it did n’t work out the first time he was coach because he was dealing with a few senior players who did not want to be challenged but i think this crop actually do want that			1
and that ’s both the young and senior ones			0
yet beating an @entity122 side who have only won one @entity124 away from home in three years is one thing			0
taking on @entity127 and @entity128 is quite another			0
@entity1 must identify the areas where they need to improve and look after @entity12 and @entity11 for that spell of 17 tests in just nine months that follows the @entity133			2
but do n’t be fearful of @entity127			0
@entity1 , with so many players coming through , are a team to invest in			2
they are on an upward curve			0
@entity127 , meanwhile , have got some older players who might be going in the other direction			0
there is much to look forward to .			2

@entity34 's @entity1 thrash @entity8 to win series 3 - 1
@entity8 bowled out for just *94* during second innings at @entity80
@entity105 has shown why he is the right man to take @entity1 forward
