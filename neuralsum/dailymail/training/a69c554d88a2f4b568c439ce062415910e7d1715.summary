in a week that has seen @entity2 talk loudly about progress off the field at their new @entity5 , it is time for @entity7 ’s side to make sure they do n’t exit the @entity9 with a whisper			1
city are the @entity12 champions and now boast a training centre — the @entity14 — that they hope will bring them a steady stream of young talent for years to come			2
understandably , they are rather proud of this			2
in @entity21 , though , they continue to play like novices			2
on wednesday evening , at the @entity47 in @entity34 , @entity2 face a task best explained thus : if they avoid defeat , score a goal and better @entity52 ’s result in @entity53 then they will squeeze through to the knockout stages			1
anything else and the question marks will begin			2
one man who will be missing is @entity29			2
@entity7 revealed the @entity58 could be out for up to six weeks on tuesday , while rejecting suggestions another @entity9 exit would put his position at the @entity62 under threat			1
‘ @entity29 ’s recovery will depend on the first weeks , ’ explained the @entity64			2
‘ it ’s an important stage right at the beginning			0
but , as i said , our team does n’t depend on a single player and i hope my players can prove it			0
‘ i think we will qualify but it has nothing to do with my future here , ’ he added			0
‘ i never received any pressure from the club			0
‘ we started with a target of trying to qualify for the last 16			0
' we have a good squad but made a lot of mistakes in other games , especially against @entity52			0
' against @entity42 we showed we are fighting to qualify and i am sure we will do it if we play a good game			1
it ’s very important for the club to play in the next round			0
’ @entity91 and @entity92 head to @entity34 with their team - mates ready to face @entity95 on wednesday @entity96 and @entity97 head with the squad into @entity99 to travel to face @entity95 wednesday evening is important for @entity2 for all kinds of reasons			1
qualification for the next stage is important financially , for example			0
it also matters in terms of their seeding for next year ’s competition but , perhaps most significantly , it is important for the @entity112 champions ’ self - respect and the manner in which they are viewed around @entity21			1
if things go right for a team that — to their credit — have used @entity29 ’s goals against @entity42 as a catalyst for improvement , who knows where they may go in this competition ? @entity2 's squad get ready to head for departures at the city 's airport ahead of their clash in @entity34 @entity7 will rely upon @entity91 ( left ) and @entity131 ( right ) with star striker @entity29 injured @entity92 ( left ) and @entity132 ( right ) train ahead of @entity2 's trip to @entity134 city travel to @entity95 for a game they need to get a result from in order to progress in the @entity9 if things go very wrong , however , they could find themselves without even the consolation of the @entity145 place handed to those that finish third in the groups			1
that scenario would be rather embarrassing			0
despite the absence of @entity29 and the suspended @entity151 , @entity2 are boosted by the possible return from injury of @entity31 and @entity154			1
‘ it will be a big game for @entity95 , too , ’ said @entity91			1
‘ i think the atmosphere will be amazing and that ’s what football ’s about , and the kind of games we want to play			0
’ @entity31 strides ahead of @entity162 and @entity163 during some warm - up drills in training @entity91 is expected to stand in for @entity29 and he is in no doubt about the importance of the task			2
‘ it was a big blow for us to lose @entity29 but we have to deal with it and we have won five in a row			2
there is better confidence , a better atmosphere in the team when you ’re winning			0
hopefully we can be even better in the next week			0
there are some big , crucial games			0
‘ i ’m there when the team needs me and i ’m happy to be back , ’ the @entity181 added			0
‘ i ’ll do my best to try and score goals and bring something good to the team			0
@entity7 wanders across the @entity14 pitch as the squad trains before the @entity95 clash ‘ it ’s a special situation for us in the league and the @entity9 because we ’ve had to catch up in both			1
we were eight points behind @entity193 and we knew , ok , now we have to start playing			2
in the @entity9 it has been the same			1
maybe we need that pressure			0
’ @entity197 ’s momentum has been driven by a ‘ needs must ’ attitude is interesting , though @entity91 ’s manager might disagree			0
the fact is @entity7 ’s side have improved recently and they have a chance against a @entity95 team second in @entity205 but one that boasts a @entity9 record as peculiar as @entity2 ’s is mundane			1
city have been consistently disappointing , while @entity95 — who won 5 - 1 at home to @entity52 but lost 7 - 1 in the same venue against @entity42 — have oscillated wildly			1
another @entity46 team once beat @entity95 7 - 1 in this competition			1
@entity2 would surely take something rather less dramatic			1
@entity95 captain @entity216 leads his team on a run during training in @entity34 before wednesday 's clash @entity95 legend @entity216 and @entity221 train ahead of the @entity9 decider			1

@entity2 face @entity95 in their final @entity9 group game
the two sides are level on points making the tie a winner - takes - all affair
@entity7 says his job will not be under threat even if they lose
