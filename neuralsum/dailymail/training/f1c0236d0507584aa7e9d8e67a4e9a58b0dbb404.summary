and now scientists have found that scents smelling unusual can also be an indicator of anxiety			1
humans ’ sense of smell is affected when we are anxious , with stress re-wiring the brain so that scents do n’t smell right , according to a new study			1
something smells off : humans ' sense of smell is affected when we are anxious , with stress re-wiring the brain so that scents do n't smell right , according to a new study			1
previously neutral smells become unpleasant and the greater the stress , the larger the change in smell , scientists claim previously neutral smells become unpleasant and the greater the stress , the larger the change in smell , scientists claim			1
@entity35 , a professor of psychology at the @entity37 , used brain imaging to reveal how anxiety or stress can rewire the brain , linking centres of emotion and smell - processing to make typically benign smells foul stenches			1
for the study , published in the @entity49 , subjects were made anxious by showing them disturbing pictures and text of subjects like car crashes and war			0
the study found that this transformed neutral odours to distasteful ones , which the scientists explained could fuel a feedback loop heightening distress and leading to clinical issues like anxiety and depression			1
‘ after anxiety induction , neutral smells become clearly negative , ’ professor @entity35 said			2
‘ people experiencing an increase in anxiety show a decrease in the perceived pleasantness of odours			2
it becomes more negative as anxiety increases			2
’ stress transforms neutral odours into distasteful ones , which could fuel a feedback loop heightening distress and leading to depression using behavioural techniques and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity81 ) , professor @entity35 's team looked at the brains of 12 human subjects with induced anxiety as they processed known neutral odours			1
before entering the @entity81 scanner where participants were shown a series of disturbing pictures and text , subjects were exposed to and rated a panel of neutral smells			0
in the course of the experiment , the scientists observed that two distinct and typically independent circuits of the brain - one dedicated to olfactory processing , the other to emotion - become intimately intertwined under conditions of anxiety			1
after anxiety induction and the imaging process , subjects were asked again to rate the panel of neutral smells , and most assigned negative responses to smells they previously rated as neutral			1
professor @entity35 said : ‘ in typical odour processing , it is usually just the olfactory system that gets activated , but when a person becomes anxious , the emotional system becomes part of the olfactory processing stream			2
’ the old saying ' a problem shared is a problem halved ' may have been based on scientific fact , according to a study published in january			0
researchers from @entity118 have proved that the best way to beat stress is to share your feelings - and sharing with someone in the same situation yields the best results			1
this is because sharing a threatening situation with a person in a similar emotional state ' buffers individuals from experiencing the heightened levels of stress that typically accompany threat ' , the study claims			2
a total of 52 female undergraduates were paired up and asked to make a speech while being taped by researchers from the @entity140 @entity139			0
prior to each speech , participants were encouraged to discuss how they felt about public speaking with the researchers , and their fellow participants			0
other participants were told not to discuss their feelings			0
levels of the stress hormone cortisol were measured before , during and after each participant 's speech			2
the researchers found that stress levels were significantly reduced when the participants were able to vocalise how they felt about the speeches			1
this was most noticeable when the discussion was had with a fellow participant , in which they shared a common fear			0
although those two systems of the brain are right next to each other , under normal circumstances there is limited crosstalk between the two			0
however , under conditions of induced anxiety , the @entity37 team observed the emergence of a unified network cutting across the two systems			1
the results could be used to uncover the biological mechanisms at play during periods of anxiety			0
professor @entity35 said : ‘ we encounter anxiety and as a result we experience the world more negatively			0
‘ the environment smells bad in the context of anxiety			0
it can become a vicious cycle , making one more susceptible to a clinical state of anxiety as the effects accumulate			0
‘ it can potentially lead to a higher level of emotional disturbances with rising ambient sensory stress			0

scientists from the @entity37 found that the greater the stress , the larger the change in smell
brain imaging revealed how anxiety can rewire the brain , linking centres of emotion and smell - processing
