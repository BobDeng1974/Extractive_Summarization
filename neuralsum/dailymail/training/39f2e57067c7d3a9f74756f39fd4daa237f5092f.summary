while @entity0 continues to explore the possibility of representing @entity2 his brother , @entity3 , has claimed their exile across the @entity6 partly stems from @entity7 adopting a top - heavy selection policy			2
‘ the reason i left @entity13 was the coaches from @entity7 pretty much saying , “ if you ’re not in the top four teams , you ’re not going to play for @entity7 again ” , ’ said the @entity10 full back			1
‘ i could have stayed at @entity16 and finished sixth or seventh and not played for @entity7			2
’ he has a point			0
the latest @entity7 line - up , against @entity20 in @entity21 in june , featured 14 players from clubs in the top five of the @entity26 last season : @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity33 lock @entity32 was the only intruder , with his club finishing seventh			0
@entity36 runs with the ball druing @entity10 's @entity39 top 14 match against @entity40 in all , nine of the league ’s 12 clubs were represented in that @entity7 match - day 23 , so it was in fact a reasonable spread of players from throughout the division			1
@entity28 ’s five - man contingent was the largest , reflecting their title - winning season			2
the bottom line is that @entity54 , along with coaches of other leading nations , sets a lot of store on primary @entity60 matches and major league head - to - heads , which provide the nearest simulation of international rugby			0
on that basis , @entity36 is right that national selection will inevitably reflect the balance of power at any given time			2
perhaps it would be good for the bigger - picture if the team was founded on a wider base , but that is unrealistic			0
the cream will rise , unless a root - and - branch overhaul produces an unthinkable draft system			0
instead , the likes of @entity13 must continue to strive to lower the colours of richer rivals , as they so nearly did to @entity27 last weekend — and rail against any sense of serving merely as feeder clubs for others with larger budgets			0
@entity10 's @entity0 is @entity85 and wants to play for @entity7 , but is in a preliminary squad for @entity2 quote of the week even in the aftermath of his @entity29 team ’s 45 - 0 drubbing in @entity31 , @entity87 was in fine form with the media			1
responding to questions about the club ’s training regime in light of their injury crisis , he said : ‘ maybe we ’ll just go to @entity99 and go go - karting ! if i took them go - karting , some b * * * * * * would get run over ! we train twice on tuesday and thursday			0
it did n’t harm us ( @entity29 teams he played in ) — we were quite good then ! ’ @entity87 , the @entity29 director of rugby , whose team were defeated 45 - 0 , walks off the field while the @entity110 rages on in @entity111 and @entity112 on saturday , the most important match in a @entity115 context will take place in a frozen , remote @entity118 city			1
@entity119 hosts the first leg of a qualification match between @entity122 and @entity123 , which will decide who snatches the last tournament place in @entity7 ’s pool			1
it promises to be an intriguing duel , as the visitors lie 19th in the @entity131 rankings , one place above their hosts , while four of the past five meetings between the nations since 2008 have been won by seven points or fewer			0
officially , the world game ’s leading administrators will remain neutral , but no doubt they would be glad to see ‘ the @entity145 ’ reach next year ’s event on these shores — in the hope that a potentially huge market will increasingly embrace the sport			0
sir @entity146 will take charge of the @entity148 for autumn matches against @entity150 and @entity29 , with the task of ensuring the invitational side remain relevant			1
after a high - calibre squad were dismantled 59 - 8 by the @entity157 in @entity158 in june last year , the concept and future of the side was again in doubt			0
however , a side coached by @entity161 went some way to redressing the balance by beating an @entity7 xv 39 - 29 in june and now it falls to @entity146 to oversee a competitive game against the @entity150 at @entity165 on november 1 , to justify ticket sales which have already passed 50,000			1
@entity146 ( left ) has been names as the @entity148 coach for their @entity170 tie against @entity150			1

@entity10 full back @entity36 says @entity7 *favour* players from the @entity26 's big clubs
@entity87 remains in good humour with the media in spite of the tough times at @entity29
@entity122 and @entity123 are preparing for the play off match to decide who snatches the last tournament place in @entity7 ’s @entity115 pool *group*
sir @entity146 will take charge of the @entity148 for autumn matches against @entity150 and @entity29
