the sun was in my eyes so i put my hand up to stop myself being blinded			0
' some people thought i was saluting and they wrote to the local paper			2

it was viewed by more than 15,000 people both in the newspaper and online			0
however , one reader , @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 , wrote a letter of objection under the headline ‘ picture in poor taste ’			0
it read : ' has your photographer run out of favourite places to take photos that he has to stoop himself and prowl around cemeteries taking photos of a half naked gravedigger and calling this his " favourite picture going down the dead men ” ? ' how must the grieving family feel for whose relative @entity7 is digging the grave , knowing that mr @entity7 has been photographed half naked and saluting in their relative ’s grave			1
' is n’t there nothing more sacred than man ’s and woman ’s last resting place ? ' mr @entity62 defended the picture and said that as mr @entity7 was a ' local legend ' he felt that digging the graves would make a nice newspaper feature			1
interest : photographer @entity62 said that as mr @entity7 was a ' local legend ' he felt that grave digging would make a good newspaper feature he said : ' every week we have a picture of the week in the paper i work for , i had seen @entity7 digging graves quite often and decided to take a picture of it			1

he ’s a really popular guy			0
