how safe is our tap water ? it has long been a source of national pride that we can drink straight from our taps without trepidation			1
but mounting scientific evidence shows that well - intentioned efforts to make our water healthier - by adding fluoride to prevent tooth decay - may actually be having serious long - term effects on our health			1
scientists warn that the risks of this controversial public health policy include brain impairment in children , liver and kidney disease , crippling bone disorders and , ironically , disfigured teeth			1
investigators also argue that fluoridation does not bring significant benefits over other health initiatives , such as encouraging children and adults to brush their teeth properly			2
scientists warn that the risks of ' water fluoridation ' include brain impairment in children , liver and kidney disease , crippling bone disorders and , ironically , disfigured teeth yesterday , a new danger was added to the risk list when researchers at the @entity39 warned that the mineral may be responsible for causing depression , weight gain and tiredness			1
they argue that these debilitating symptoms are the result of hypothyroidism — the failure of the thyroid gland to produce hormones that regulate the metabolism			0
their study , published in the @entity53 , says that areas of @entity55 with water fluoridation are linked to rates of hypothyroidism 30 per cent higher than expected			1
the watchdog @entity55 moved to assure people that ' the totality of evidence , accumulated over decades of research , tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure , and shows no association with reduced thyroid function '			1
but professor @entity70 , who led the new study , said that instead of putting more fluoride in our water , the policy should be reversed : ' consideration needs to be given to reducing fluoride exposure , ' he said			2
new research found areas of @entity55 with water fluoridation are linked to rates of hypothyroidism 30 per cent higher than expected			1
hypothyroidism causes depression , weight gain and tiredness ( file photo ) that may not be so easily done			1
more than five - and - a - half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the ' optimum ' level of one part per million parts of water ( 1ppm ) , according to the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			1

areas of the country with fluoridation schemes include @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , the @entity107 and @entity108			2
a further 330,000 people drink supplies that are naturally fluoridated by rocks in the ground to the level of 1ppm — including residents of @entity115 and @entity116 in the @entity117 of @entity55 , @entity118 in @entity119 and parts of @entity121 and @entity122			1
( other parts of @entity124 , which are not artificially fluoridated and have low natural levels of fluoride in local rocks , see concentrations of 0.1ppm or even lower in their drinking water			2
) greater fluoridation would cut the admission to hospital of some 26,000 children aged between five and nine for tooth decay , doctors have warned that 's about one in ten of the population exposed to the 1ppm fluoride level , says the @entity94 , which promotes the treatment of @entity124 water			1
the medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental decay began in january 1945 when community water supplies in @entity146 , @entity147 , were fluoridated to 1ppm			2
but health concerns have meant that in recent years that level has been reduced in the @entity147 to 0.7ppm			0
nonetheless , politicians and dentists here are pushing for more of us to have our water supplemented to that 1ppm level			2

( other parts of @entity124 , which are not artificially fluoridated and have low natural levels of fluoride in local rocks , see concentrations of 0.1ppm or even lower in their drinking water			2
) only last month , leaders at the @entity179 ' faculty of dental surgery published a report saying greater fluoridation would cut the admission to hospital annually of some 26,000 children aged between five and nine for tooth decay			0
' water fluoridation is one way of overcoming that , ' said the faculty 's dean , professor @entity190			1
in december , @entity193 shadow health secretary @entity192 pledged to make a priority of adding fluoride to water if his party wins the election			0
' it 's a simple way to improve the health of children			0
there is no evidence it damages health , ' he argued			0
certainly , it 's recognised by the @entity207 that fluoride disrupts the process of decay by making enamel more resistant to acid attack — which is the cause of rotting teeth — and reducing plaque bacteria 's ability to produce acid			0
the mineral also strengthens enamel in children 's growing teeth			0
however , if a chemical affects the human body in one way , it is almost certainly bound to change other things			0
and it is these side - effects that particularly alarm some scientists			1
it is also worth noting that the mineral which occurs naturally in water is calcium fluoride , while the chemical used to supplement levels of water is sodium fluoride — which critics say can be more dangerous to health			1
as well as specifically physical side - effects related to fluoridation , there are also concerns over its effect on our brains			1
a 2012 analysis of previous studies found strong indications that fluoride supplementation may hinder children 's intellectual development , causing on average a drop of seven iq points			0
fluoride in water may also harm internal organs			0
a @entity259 laboratory study found evidence of liver damage that seems to have been caused by the fluoride interfering with the way our bodies use antioxidants to defend against tissues breaking down			0
there are also suspected links with kidney disease			1
one study has found an association between high levels of fluoride in the water and painful kidney stones , which were four times more common than in a similar area without high fluoride , researchers found			1
scientists warn that the risks of adding fluoride to water include brain impairment in children , liver and kidney disease , crippling bone disorders and , ironically , disfigured teeth ( file picture ) the most obvious evidence of harm from fluoride supplementation is dental fluorosis , where teeth become mottled and discoloured by over-exposure			1
it is also possible that chronic bone disease skeletal fluorosis can be caused by ingesting large amounts of fluoride , which can lead to crippling arthritis , bone fractures and muscle weakness			1
in response to the established risks , it is recommended by the @entity307 that an adult does not consume more than 3 - 4mg of fluoride per day — the equivalent of drinking three to four litres of water with 1ppm fluoride ( the @entity124 has established no maximum @entity313 of fluoride )			2
but it is more complicated than that			0
the dangers from exposure to fluoride have been increased over the past few years as the mineral has increasingly been added to commercial products — not only toothpaste but others such as baby milk formula			0
even tea can push you over the limit , especially in areas with fluoridated water			0
a study by @entity331 found cheap supermarket tea is particularly high in the mineral , which occurs in it naturally			0
four mugs of tea can contain as much as 6mg			0
nevertheless , local authorities are currently pushing , with the encouragement of @entity55 , to fluoridate more people 's water			1
but the backlash has begun			0
earlier this month , protesters in @entity343 launched a campaign to halt the city council 's plans to add fluoride to their water			0
figures show 43 per cent of children in @entity343 are suffering tooth decay , one of the worst rates in the country			0
however , local protesters , such as @entity356 , of @entity357 , fear the dangers of unwanted side - effects			1
' this is compulsory medication , ' he says			0
' it is just crazy			0
' another obstacle lies in the path of the pro-fluoridation camp — a significant hole in their argument that mineral supplementation is the best way to improve mass dental health about ten years ago , a review of previous evidence by @entity375 researchers found that tooth decay in children across @entity378 had fallen , irrespective of fluoride in the water			1
indeed , the countries showing the biggest decrease — @entity383 , the @entity384 , @entity385 and @entity386 — do not fluoridate their supplies			0
' this probably reflects use of fluoridated toothpastes and other factors , including perhaps nutrition , ' said the investigators in the @entity395 , who concluded that the evidence ' on the potential benefits and harms of adding fluoride to water is relatively poor '			0
this argument was perhaps unwittingly reinforced last year by national survey evidence from @entity55 itself			2
the authority warned that drinking fruit juice and squash from bottles and feeding cups was responsible for significant amounts of tooth decay , and called for under - threes to have milk and water			2
and surely it is just such mass education — not mass medication — that in the long term will improve dental health			0
our health chiefs should treat us as adults			0
rather than slipping something into our water , is n't it high time these authorities introduced sanctions against parents who fecklessly allow their children 's teeth to rot ? drinking fruit juice and squash from bottles and feeding cups was responsible for significant amounts of tooth decay , and called for under - threes to have milk and water instead			2

researchers have said the mineral could cause depression and weight gain
brain impairment , kidney disease , bone disorders are possible side - effects
@entity55 has assured people that ' water fluoridation ' is safe
