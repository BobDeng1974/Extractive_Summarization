almost three times as many schoolgirls as previously thought were seized from an exam hall by violent @entity5 extremists , it has been claimed			1
a statement by officials had said that 85 girls aged 16 - 18 , who were sitting a physics exam , were kidnapped from the school in @entity11 , @entity12 last week			1
but today the governor of the region , who visited the town today , said that grief - stricken parents told him officials had ignored them when drawing up the list of 85 , and that in fact 234 girls had been taken			1
attacks : a heavy military presence in the @entity23 region of @entity12 did not prevent the kidnapping ( file photo ) security officials had warned gov. @entity27 that it was too dangerous for him to drive to @entity11 , 80 miles from @entity29 , the @entity23 state capital and birthplace of the @entity32 terrorist network blamed for the abductions			1
the discrepancy in the drastically different figures could not immediately be resolved			0
@entity23 state education commission @entity36 and the principal of the @entity39 had initially said that 129 science students were at the school to write a physics exam when the abductors struck , after midnight on april 14			0
twenty - eight pupils escaped from their captors between tuesday and friday			0
then another 16 were found to be day scholars who had returned to their homes in @entity11 before the attack			1
that left 85 missing students , according to school officials			0
this latest confusion comes after the military had reported last week that all but eight of those abducted had been rescued - but then retracted the claim the following day			0
security sources have said they are in ' hot pursuit ' of the abductors , but so far they have not rescued any of the girls and young women , aged between 16 and 18			1
attack : the militants struck in @entity11 , in northwestern @entity12 , last month parents and other town residents have joined the search for the students in the @entity68 which borders @entity11 town and is a known hideout for the militants			1
the kidnappings are believed to have been carried out by @entity12 's @entity74 extremist rebels , known as @entity32			2
@entity32 - the nickname means ' @entity77 education is sinful ' - is violently campaigning to establish an @entity74 shariah state in @entity12 , whose 170 million people are about half @entity82 and half @entity81			2
@entity32 has been abducting some girls and young women in attacks on schools , villages and towns but last week 's mass kidnapping is unprecedented			0
the extremists use the young women as porters , cooks and sex slaves , according to @entity12 officials			2
@entity32 was on a rampage last week , staging four attacks in three days that began with a massive explosion during rush hour at a busy bus station monday morning in @entity101 , the capital in the center of the country , which killed at least 75 people and wounded 141			0
@entity12 's military and government had claimed to have the militants on the run and contained in a remote northeast corner on the border with @entity111			2
but extremist attacks have increased in frequency and become ever deadlier this year with more than 1,500 people killed so far , compared to an estimated 3,600 between 2010 and 2013 .			0

girls aged 16 - 18 were seized from an exam hall in @entity11 , @entity12
reports by officials first said that *85girls* were still *unaccounted* for
but now the region 's governor says parents told him more are missing
he was told that 234 were gone - almost three times the first figure
