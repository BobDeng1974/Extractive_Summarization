by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:54 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 02:58 est , 25 october 2012 shamed @entity4 ’s official @entity3 has been scrapped by new chief whip sir @entity5			1
the gas - guzzling car was ordered by mr @entity4 after he discovered he would have to walk the 200 yards from @entity7 to @entity8			1
but on friday he was forced to resign , a month after a foul - mouthed rant at police officers who told him he could not ride his bike through the @entity7 gates			2
at the height of the plebgate row , @entity4 emerged from a small blue car to deliver an apology			0
but he had a @entity18 on order now sir @entity5 – dubbed the bicycling baronet for his preferred mode of transport – has pulled the plug before a final contract was signed			1
two weeks after his appointment mr @entity4 had demanded a dedicated vehicle to ferry him and other whips around the corner in @entity30			2
while most ministers use an eco-friendly @entity32 , mr @entity4 insisted on a @entity18			0
but sir @entity5 was appalled at the idea and has cancelled the order			1
a @entity36 source said : ‘ in a nutshell the order had been placed but the contract was never signed			0
the new chief whip is happy not to have a car			0
’ the move will save £ 100,000 for the taxpayer			0
new chief whip sir @entity5 , ( left ) who has cancelled the @entity3 order , has long had a reputation in @entity30 as the ' bicycling baronet ' for his love of two wheels ( right ) mr @entity4 ’s demand staggered civil servants since whips do not have public engagements			1
on september 19 while trying to leave @entity7 on his bike , mr @entity4 was told by officers to use a side gate			1
in his extraordinary resignation letter mr @entity4 denied calling police officers ‘ plebs ’ , as they have claimed , but admitted swearing at them , telling the prime minister he had said : ‘ i thought you guys were supposed to * * * * ing help us			1
’ this appears to contradict an appearance in the @entity66 earlier this week when he was seen mouthing the words ‘ i did n’t swear ’			0
he said in his letter : ‘ over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter i will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish			0
’ @entity76 said he was ‘ sorry ’ to lose mr @entity4 but understood why he was leaving			0
yesterday the prime minister was ridiculed by @entity78 , because he had replaced @entity80 - educated mr @entity79 with sir @entity5 , who went to @entity82 .			2

sir @entity5 pulls the plug on *luxury* car order saving £ 100,000
