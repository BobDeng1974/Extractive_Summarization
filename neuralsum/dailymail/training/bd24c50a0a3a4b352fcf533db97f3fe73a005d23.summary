@entity1 's three biggest water companies are to lift their hosepipe bans tomorrow , the @entity3 can reveal			2
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 are to end restrictions because of the ‘ exceptional ’ rainfall over the last three days , on top of april ’s record levels			1
it comes as parts of the @entity13 including the road , pictured below , leading into @entity15 , were left submerged after enduring almost two months ’ worth of rain in as many days			1
a river runs through it : the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity15 , resembles a river complete with floating cars today after the heavy rain lapping waters : @entity19 , in @entity20 , @entity15 , was underwater today as were any unfortunate cars left parked on it @entity27 about on the river : locals wade through the flood water in a boat along the road in @entity20 near @entity15 , @entity33 , yesterday water cycling : a man makes his way along the flooded road in @entity20 , @entity15 today after the @entity38 and mid @entity39 were worst hit by the rain which has battered @entity1 no signs of receding : resident @entity43 looks at the flooded road in @entity46 , from a safe vantage point yesterday water world : much of the @entity49 on @entity50 , @entity15 lies underwater today after the region was hit with nearly a month and a half 's worth of rain in 36 hours floating city : the @entity49 in @entity15 was subject to a flood alert from the @entity57 yesterday closed : @entity58 on the edge of @entity60 , @entity33 , was forced to close after being badly flooded not so smart ... a couple braved this flood in @entity63 , @entity64 in their @entity65 and miraculously made it through without conking out yesterday ... unlike these two : two cars sit in the flood water in @entity63 after not quite making it through the water yesterday those reaching for the how to emigrate handbook should be aware that scorching weather is predicted for the first two weeks of july and for a two - week spell in august			1
long - range weather forecaster @entity77 said @entity79 was set to ' swelter ' during the second week of the @entity81 , with temperatures hitting more than @entity83			1
@entity84 will also bask in sunshine during the second week of the tournament - but only after rain has washed out the first week of tennis			2
mr @entity77 , whose meteorological skills were used by the royal family when planning prince @entity91 and @entity93 ’s wedding , said : ' unfortunately this wet weather and cold easterly wind is going to stay with us now until the end of june			1
' but the heat will arrive in the first week of july and last right through to the 15th			2
temperatures might even get to 30 by the middle of the month			2
' and despite the recent deluge of rain , mr @entity77 said the hot , dry weather predicted for july and august would mean the drought in the @entity38 was likely to continue into next year			1
the 72 - year - old amateur forecaster , who uses phases of the moon and his observations of nature to predict the weather , said by the end of the summer the drought would be worse than that of 1976 - when some households were even left without tap water			1
mr @entity77 , whose forecasts focus on @entity79 and the @entity38 , also said there wo n’t be a repeat of last year ’s glorious autumn			1
he said : ' the first two weeks of september will be pretty good , but then rain storms will come in			2
' @entity120 play day : a seagull swoops in to a flooded public park in @entity124 , @entity125 , after rain continued to pound the region today wading in june : a couple wade through flood water at @entity130 near @entity131 after heavy rain led to widespread flooding across the country not 99 weather : a trio trudge along @entity138 seafront as the rain lashes down			1
parts of @entity125 have been the worst affected in the deluge cow - tastrophe : a herd of cattle had to be rescued from a flooded field in @entity33 by the @entity146 after the @entity147 burst its banks spraying the roadside : a car drives through a large puddle on a road amid persistent rain in the village of @entity155 , @entity156 dangerous : the standing water was a hazard on the road in @entity155 as cars and lorries were forced to slow down to cross it hazardous : a lorry prepares to negotiate standing water on the @entity166 , which is closed due to flooding in @entity168 near @entity169 , @entity156			1
the @entity57 has put out more than 40 flood warnings across the country be aware : the map on the left shows the rain concentrated in the @entity38 this week while the map on the right shows the majority of yesterday 's red flood warnings were located in the @entity38 and @entity179 homes were evacuated , schools were closed and dozens of areas were put on flood alert , with @entity15 and @entity138 particularly badly hit			1
the hosepipe ban started on april 5 and has been in place for just over two months , but ever since it began @entity1 has been deluged by rain			2
april and the @entity187 were a washout for tens of thousands of families , and after a brief respite in may the bad weather returned for the @entity193 celebrations last week			0
the ban covered the use of hosepipes for watering gardens , filling paddling pools and washing cars			0
those spotted flouting the ban faced fines of up to £ 1,000			0
ministers are expected to announce tomorrow that 15million of the 21million people currently covered by the ban will be free to use their hosepipes again			0
a source told the @entity3 : ‘ the recent very heavy rain , the record rainfalls in april and the reasonable amount of rain in may have all eased the problems			0
four smaller water companies – @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 and @entity219 – are expected to keep the ban in place			1
the source said this is because they rely far more heavily on groundwater pulled from bore holes deep underground , where the heavy rain has n’t yet managed to penetrate			0
residents of @entity230 , leading into @entity15 , will have little need of their hosepipes just yet after 36 hours of continuous rain in the @entity38 turned the road into a river			1
floodwater rose almost waist - deep in places , cars were submerged and some residents resorted to boats to get around			0
and in the village of @entity242 , also in @entity33 , emergency teams waded through water and used boats to reach 250 vulnerable homes to make sure residents were safe following reports of flooding up to 6ft deep			1
last night it was the @entity249 ’s turn to suffer the full force of what is rapidly becoming ‘ @entity252 ’			0
@entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 all suffered torrential rain , and up to 60mm is predicted for today			0
the @entity57 said there is a ‘ continued risk ’ of surface water flooding from overwhelmed drains across parts of @entity79 , @entity38 and @entity33 , @entity219 and @entity262			1

rain - cation : bedraggled tourists cross a @entity272 flag - lined @entity270 in the downpour as heavy rain hit the capital causing miserable conditions for many dark and stormy : the @entity1 is shrouded in rain clouds on a weather map yesterday morning have you taken any good weather pictures ? from flooding in your area to people splashing in puddles we want to see them			2
send them for publication - with plenty of caption detail - to the @entity292 on the email address : @entity293 yet as the @entity13 suffered a deluge , the @entity294 basked in sunshine			0
daytrippers in @entity298 enjoyed the summer colours of the @entity301 ’s @entity300 , while @entity302 is enjoying unusually dry – if cool – weather for this time of year			0
@entity304 , a forecaster for @entity305 , explained : ‘ the reason it has been so wet in the @entity13 is because the jet stream has switched from its normal position just to the north of @entity302 to down over southern @entity311 this month , and depressions follow that feature			0
‘ it ’s a reversal of the average weather pattern , ’ he said			0
‘ normally it gets wetter as you go to the @entity318			0
this month it gets wetter as you go @entity13			0
’ this is what summer 's like ! visitors relax in @entity300 near @entity322 , @entity298			0
