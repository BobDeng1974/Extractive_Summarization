by @entity0 published : 17:25 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 04:13 est , 3 october 2013 the morning found me with a slight champagne hangover and the smudged remains of the previous evening 's carefully applied make - up on an unfamiliar pillow			1
it was the morning after the night i 'd been fretting about for the previous two - and - a half weeks , and the prospect of which had terrified me for the past three years			1
i had just spent the night with @entity8 - the first man i 'd been intimate with since the break - up of my 15 - year marriage			1
this was the first time in 20 years that i 'd found myself lying beside a sleeping form with whom i 'd shared none of life 's major milestones : not children , not mortgage , not wedding			1
@entity0 says the thought of being intimate with another man sent me into a mild panic all we 'd shared were a few jolly nights out , where we 'd tentatively opened up to each other			1
as i mulled this over in this strange bedroom , i was overwhelmed with confusion			1
here i was sharing a bed with a man about whom i knew so little , he did n't even know whether to offer me tea or coffee			2
the encounter had left me experiencing such a torrent of emotion , what did it say about the new , unfettered me ? but at the same time i still fizzed with the euphoria i 'd revelled in the night before			2
i had returned to a strange land where i had n't thought i belonged any more			2
a club to which i - a 45 - year - old with a body battle - scarred by time and childbirth - thought my membership had expired			1
it 's a place more and more middle - aged women like me find themselves nowadays , as marriages break down and society now fully expects - indeed encourages - us to embrace the dating scene again with the same gusto we displayed in our youth			1
not so long ago , a newly single woman in her 40s , with two children , would have been expected by society to put on a brave face , say nothing of the pain caused by her divorce and resign herself to celibacy			1
but today , in a society where 42 per cent of marriages end , leaving thousands of women in their 40s like me , bruised and lonely , there is a belief that middle - aged women can and should find new love			1
i was not of that mind , though , when my husband and i split up three years ago			2
i did n't expect to find love again , and , besides , the thought of being intimate with another man sent me into a mild panic			2
the creeping waistline , the not - so - perky breasts ... how on earth could i ever undress in front of someone again ? to a man who has been with you through two pregnancies , stretchmarks are one thing			1
the thought of a new lover appraising them on your naked form is quite another			2
add to that the fact that i had n't even properly disrobed in front of my ex in the dying years of our relationship and you can imagine the fear sex with a new partner instilled in me			1
my ex and i had become more like brother and sister than @entity106 and @entity107 , and , like many siblings , we fought like cat and dog			2
but the things we argued about were far from familial			2
they were the classic gripes of long - haul coupledom : housework , childcare and money			1
in the end , the brawls became so unpleasant , so frequent and so personal that i asked for a separation			2
on may 1 , 2010 , my husband left the family home , leaving me alone with our two children , then aged nine and two			2
' to a man who has been with you through two pregnancies , stretchmarks are one thing , ' she says in the event , it was , thank goodness , a relatively cordial separation - when my ex visits the children , he often stays with us			1
after the split i felt sad for my daughter and son			2
when i had planned my family , this was not how i imagined life would turn out			2
but i also felt tremendous relief			2
it was so wonderful to be single again			1
to have no one to argue with			2
to go to bed on my own			2
to not find dirty socks under the bed , and stubble in the sink			2
but , inevitably , this euphoria did n't last			2
after a couple of months , i was utterly exhausted			0
every working mother with young children knows how difficult it is to do two jobs			0
well , if you are a single working mother , it is twice as hard			1
it left me with little inclination and no energy for another relationship			0
i was n't even thinking about dating , let alone sex , at all			1
that part of me had shut down			0
my sexuality was in a @entity168 - sleep , from which i had neither the courage nor the desire to wake			1
the wild , sensual woman i 'd been in my 20s felt like a person i 'd once known but no longer had anything in common with			0
so , two years later , i all but ignored the flirtatious man who had recently moved into my mansion block			0
well , i say flirtatious , but if i 'm honest , i felt so off the sexual map that when we bumped into each other on the stairs and he complimented me on an item of clothing , or a new haircut , i thought he was just being friendly			0
i mean , how many red - blooded men in their 50s can recognise kitten heels ? ' very @entity189 , ' he quipped approvingly as i waited in the lobby in a pair one evening			1
for a few weeks that spring , the door to our building kept sticking			0
one day , he buzzed my intercom at dawn to be let in			0
@entity0 worried about her the not - so - perky breasts and creeping waistline he came up to thank me and when , bleary - eyed , i opened the door to my flat , he joked to the male friend with him : ' @entity204			1
i was hoping we might catch her in her nightie			0
a fortnight later , i rushed in after the school run wearing scruffy ugg boots , jeans and - worst of all - no make - up , and there he was again , in the hallway , flicking through his post			1
' i 'm taking the morning off to play 18 holes , ' he said , patting the bulging golf bag next to him			0
' fancy playing with me ? ' i declined and bounded up the stairs , my face brick - red			1
but the penny was slowly dropping			0
i realised that i 'd started caring about my appearance again			0
i started going to the gym , determined to lose a stone			0
meanwhile , @entity192 's admiring glances and gentle compliments were gradually becoming part of my life			0
could it be that my long somnolent sexuality was finally re-awakening ? ' there 's a new man in our block , ' i giggled to a friend over a bottle of wine one evening			0
' i think he might be flirting with me			0
and i really like him			0
' in the end , our @entity240 mansion block , gave us an excuse to get to know each other slowly			0
an antiques restorer by trade , when the building 's grand wooden staircase needed work , @entity192 was the obvious man for the job			0
this led to several weeks of after - hours conversations at my kitchen table , discussing mahogany banisters			1
fervent conversations that were ostensibly about work but which were really thinly - disguised dates			1
finally , he asked me on a proper one , two weeks hence			0
sex is like riding a bike : no matter how long since you have been on the saddle , you never forget how that was when the thought first struck me : what if things progressed and i had to peel off ? for although i was feeling fitter and more attractive than at any time since having my daughter 11 years before , disrobing was still a terrifying thought			1
as it happened , the date itself was a total blast			0
we went to @entity274 's @entity273 , rode in a rickshaw and had dinner in a lovely @entity278 restaurant where @entity192 ordered ginger lobster with scallions			0
as we ate , @entity192 's hand gently caressed my knee			0
we were quite clearly building up to the @entity283			0
it finally happened on a furious main road at 1.30 am while we were waiting for a cab to take us back to @entity274			1
not the most intimate of locations for my first post-marriage kiss , but no matter			0
it was long and emotional , and i knew i had reached a milestone			0
later that night , an even bigger milestone beckoned			0
on the journey home , we kissed again and , after alighting from the taxi , enjoyed a passionate embrace on the pavement outside our block			0
the next step was obvious - even to out - of - practice me			1
in the event , my fears and insecurities dwindled to nothing			0
sex , i can report , is like riding a bike : no matter how long it is since you have been on the saddle , you never forget how to cycle			1
equally pleasing is that in the heat of the moment , men do n't actually notice your cellulite , meaty upper arms or other imperfections			1
nor did i sit back and critically appraise @entity192 's 50 - something body either			1
our sexuality and taste had matured with us			0
today , i am enjoying the most rewarding relationship of my life thanks to the chemistry which exists between us			0
between the sheets , @entity192 and i simply click			0
yes , my body is less pert than it once was , but , despite all those hang - ups before @entity192 and i became lovers , i suddenly feel happier in my own skin			1
i would say to any divorced , middle - aged woman terrified of contemplating sex with a man other than her husband , to put those fears to one side and embrace an exciting new chapter in her @entity334 all , i 'm happy proof that when it comes to sex , life can indeed begin in your post-divorce 40s .			1

says sex is like riding a bike : you always remember how to do it
