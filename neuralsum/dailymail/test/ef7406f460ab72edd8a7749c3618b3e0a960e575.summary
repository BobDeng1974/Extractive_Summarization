a @entity1 cleric has issued a fatwa ordering a woman to agree to sex with her husband even if they are on the back of a camel , as he denounces the idea of marital rape as ' made up by @entity12 people '			1
@entity13 claims that , according to the @entity15 , a wife can only refuse her husband sex if she is menstruating , sick or just given birth			0
her right to say no , he asserted , was lost the moment her father handed her to her new husband			0
outrageous : @entity13 said women should never say no to their husbands - and claimed marital rape was ' made up ' by @entity12 , so there was no need for @entity28 to take any notice @entity13 told @entity30 : ' even the @entity15 says even when they 're riding on the back of the camel , when the husband asks her , she must give			1
' so there 's no such thing as rape in marriage			2
this is made by @entity12 people , why should we follow ? ' unsurprisingly , his religious edict and outrageous comments have horrified many in his home country of @entity45 and beyond			1
writing in @entity46 , @entity47 , an advocacy officer at the @entity48 in @entity49 , said : ' have we not provided excuses for rapists long enough ? ' we need to recognise that women , both married and not married , have the right over their own bodies , and that includes the right to reject sex			0
' to turn a blind eye to that right is to reduce the woman ’s dignity as a person and to further normalise the prevalence of sexual crimes in our society			0
' disgusted : his claim that women could n't even say no if they were on a camel has horrified many in the mainly @entity1 country , where an estimated 3,000 women a year are raped however , another mufti has said sex between a married couple must take place in a ' harmonious situation so as not to hurt each other ' - which means rape is not possible			1
what 's more , dr @entity80 - known as ' dr @entity81 ' - has said a man is not allowed to refuse sex with his wife , nor is he allowed to stop without ' getting consensus from his wife for fear that she did not have time to enjoy ' .			2

@entity45 cleric claims marital rape is ' made up by @entity12 people '
comments came after the *launch* of country 's ' @entity99 ' rape *campaign*
but another @entity1 *scholar* has now said men are also banned from refusing their wives - nor are they allowed to leave them ' *unsatisfied* '
