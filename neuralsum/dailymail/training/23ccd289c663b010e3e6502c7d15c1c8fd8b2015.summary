that should be noted because even when conversation turns serious , a flash of his sizeable gnashers is not far behind			0
at 28 years old , he is finally performing at a level he has worked so hard to reach			2
from a small city in the heart of @entity10 he moved 1,000 miles from home , aged 15 , to gain attention for his football and then relocated to @entity14 six years later to support his wife and baby daughter financially			1
one season in @entity18 with @entity19 stood out among many more at the second tier , before @entity21 took a calculated £ 8million gamble to bring him from @entity23 to the @entity24 this summer			1
@entity25 's @entity10 striker @entity0 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity27 last week @entity0 also scored this bullet header against @entity29 in what has been a superb start to his @entity25 career suffice to say , @entity0 ’s arrival in @entity25 — who face @entity35 at home — was starkly different to that of compatriot @entity38			1
but strikes against @entity40 , @entity29 and @entity27 have earned his new team five points and give cause for his sunny demeanour as he talks about his tough career , his enlarged family and the tattoos that run along his left arm			2
‘ i would not change anything of what i have been through to get here , ’ says @entity0 , briefly speaking @entity14			1
‘ what i am doing now is the fruit of what i fought for			0
@entity0 spent much of his career in the @entity14 lower divisions after joining @entity57 in 2008 ‘ this year i said to @entity23 i would not stay because i had a very important chance and i did not know if it would come again			1
’ in @entity60 , he adds : ‘ because i came from the @entity61 , maybe people did not expect this from me			0
but i am a striker and i work every day for that			2
now i need to work more because i want to continue to score goals and help the team			2
’ there are moments that make @entity0 turn sombre , such as when he discloses that his father @entity69 — who he calls ‘ @entity70 ’ in @entity60 — has not been able to watch him this campaign as he awaits surgery on his stomach in @entity10			1
then there is the tattoo of a symbol representing his grandfather @entity77 , who would stand over the grill during weekly barbecues and feed his 11 children and their offspring before sitting at the head of the table to hold court			0
this graphic shows the vast number of @entity87 that are now playing in the @entity24 ‘ he was really important to the whole family , ’ says @entity0			1
he kisses that tattoo on his wrist after each goal before pointing to the sky			0
he also has inkings in tribute to his two girls @entity97 and @entity98 , aged seven and one			0
‘ this is the time when my daughter @entity97 was born , ’ he says , pointing to a clock face			2
‘ and this is the dove of peace for @entity98			0
’ @entity0 grew up in @entity103 , a city of 86,000 people in northern @entity105			1
unlike @entity107 , home of @entity108 , or @entity109 , birthplace of @entity111 and @entity112 , few talent - spotters frequent @entity113			2
@entity29 's @entity115 forward @entity114 is another @entity87 who moved to @entity60 this summer he made the lengthy journey to @entity118 to play for @entity119 ( @entity119 ) aged 15 , eventually being spotted by @entity107 team @entity120 two years later			1
‘ @entity119 is a community team that brings young players from @entity105 and develops them , ’ explains @entity0			2
‘ it was my chance			0
my mother suffered a lot			0
she has three sons and i am the youngest			0
it was hard but worth the pain			0
’ aged 21 , he joined @entity57 in the @entity14 second division			1
‘ i had a wife and a daughter and i was obliged because things were not good			0
i had no other path			0
’ there were 16 goals in his debut season but @entity57 got relegated in his second			0
@entity19 took him to @entity18 in june 2010 and the following january , @entity0 scored an instinctive goal to earn a point against @entity139			2
@entity10 's @entity38 has joined @entity35 , along with fellow @entity87 @entity140 and @entity141 ‘ it ’s difficult to explain , ’ he smiles			1
‘ we lost 8 - 0 against @entity144 and then drew 1 - 1 with @entity139			0
we played all the time to avoid relegation , but i enjoyed it			0
’ the drop followed once more , though			0
that triggered his most prolific spell to date — 28 goals in 38 @entity153 games			1
in january 2013 , @entity154 paid £ 2m to take him to @entity23 and 26 goals in 58 games later , @entity21 made him @entity25 ’s no 1 target			1
the club record fee was a risk but @entity160 has also arrived and @entity0 is grateful he can pick the brains of the @entity10 star in his native tongue			1
but when it is proposed the two are close , he jokes : ‘ he ’s not my friend ! ’ @entity0 says of saturday ’s game : ‘ we need to have the ball because when @entity35 have it , it ’s very complicated			1
i watched the first half against @entity173 — and @entity141 was only on the bench ! ’ @entity0 was a popular figure at @entity23 where he scored 26 goals in 58 games after joining in january 2013			1

@entity0 has three goals in four games for @entity25
the @entity10 striker joined from @entity23 this summer
the 28 - year - old spent most of his career in the @entity14 second division
