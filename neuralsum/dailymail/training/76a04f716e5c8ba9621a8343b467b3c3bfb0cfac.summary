a 49 - year - old underwear model has accused the fashion industry of ageism as she says she can no longer get any work because she looks too young			0
@entity5 , from @entity6 , has been modelling lingerie and bikinis for more than 20 years but in the last 12 months her work has dried up			1
she said she has been repeatedly told she 's ' not suitable ' for jobs because she looks younger than her years			1
out of work : @entity5 , 49 , said looks too young to get jobs modelling clothes for women her age not compromising : she said she 's not prepared to wear dowdy clothes just because she 's expected to as she 's nearing 50 @entity5 said : ' i 'm trapped in a no - go zone for women because i am neither young enough or old enough to model ' single success : @entity5 believes she 's remained looking young because she does n't have a man the model said she could gain work if she looked older but she 's ' not prepared to fit the stereotype ' by wearing ' dowdy ' clothes just because she 's nearly 50			1
she said : ' i find it quite shocking that the fashion industry seems to have forgotten a huge swathe of women who are middle - aged but not ready to wear cardigans just yet			2
why should i wear shapeless dowdy clothes just because i ’m nearly 50 ? ' ' just because a woman is in her late 40s does n't mean she ca n't be sexy or wear underwear			1
not everyone has the figure i have but an awful lot of women do ' in the early 90s , @entity5 modelled for @entity38 , was a catwalk model at dozens of @entity41 trade shows for @entity42 and worked for @entity44 magazine			2
but she can no longer gain jobs posing in clothes aimed at her age group because she looks too young			1
and in a cruel twist , she is also unable to get work for the younger fashion market because she is considered too old			0
once in demand : in her youth , @entity5 modelled for @entity38 and @entity44 magazine ageism : @entity5 said she can no longer get jobs like this because women her age are n't deemed to wear such sexy underwear as she was : @entity5 said her legs ' have n't really changed over the years but the work has dried up anyway ' she said : ' because of my age and my looks i am trapped in a no - go zone for women because i am neither young enough or old enough to model			1
' she added : ' i have always modelled in some capacity at trade shows , magazines and for big names like @entity38 and @entity44 magazine and have always looked after myself			2
' when i decided to go freelance i started approaching agencies for work but i was told on more than one occasion i would struggle to find work because i looked too young			2
' one agency told me i looked in my 20s			0
the irony is that i wo n't even be considered for younger modelling projects because of my age			0
' perfect pins : she 's always been told she has ' good legs ' so she ca n't understand why they can no longer get her work @entity5 in her younger years : she 's maintained her size 10 figure by exercising - and staying single ' i think very often women can look older when they get in a long term relationship ' size 10 @entity90 , who works out five days a week to keep her 5ft 9ins , nine stone figure in shape , blames the stereotyping of women in the fashion industry for her career stalling			1
she 's had to set up her own website , @entity99 , to try and gain employment			2
she said : ' magazines and modelling agencies want young women to look young and more mature woman to frankly look old			0
' just because a woman is in her late 40s does n't mean she ca n't be sexy or wear underwear			0
not everyone has the figure i have but an awful lot of women do and what 's wrong with that			0
not fitting the stereotype : @entity5 said : ' women of my age with my figure are frowned on by society because for some reason we are expected to be married and our bodies gone south ' predicament : employment was n't a problem in her late 30s but now she 's struck between looking too young - but not young enough ' i 've always been told by the photographer 's i 've worked with that i have good legs for modelling			1
they have n't really changed over the years but the work has dried up anyway			0
' after approaching so many modelling agencies i know that i would get more work if i looked older but i ’m not prepared to fit the stereotype			1
' @entity5 believes her youthful looks are down to the fact she keeps fit and has remained single			1
she said : ' i exercise a lot with stretches and running but i also think one of the reasons i stay young is a lack of a man			0
' i think very often women can look older when they get in a long term relationship			0
i think this could be another reason why women of my age with my figure are frowned on by society because for some reason we are expected to be married and our bodies gone south a bit			0

@entity5 said she could gain modelling jobs if she looked older
but she 's ' not prepared to fit the stereotype '
she said , ' why should i wear dowdy clothes just because i 'm nearly 50 ? '
