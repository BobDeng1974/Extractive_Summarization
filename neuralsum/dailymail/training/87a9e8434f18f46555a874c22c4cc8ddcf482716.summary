in his youth : @entity2 , who helped bury @entity4 , wants his fallen comrade exhumed and re-buried for seven decades @entity2 believed the soldier he buried in a battlefield after his death in front of him was given a proper military funeral and headstone in a cemetery			1
but when the 95 - year - old @entity15 @entity3 ’s friends visited the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , they could not find any memorial for @entity4			1
the soldier was first buried in unmarked graves along with rifleman @entity22 and @entity24 @entity23 , close to where the three men fell during @entity27 in july 1943			1
after the war , the bodies of @entity29 and @entity30 were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the @entity17 cemetery			1
it had been presumed that @entity36 was also re-buried there after a funeral following his death at @entity40 in @entity41 , which preceded the mainland @entity43			1
so when friends told mr @entity2 they were visiting the cemetery , the great - grandfather asked them to leave flowers on the grave of @entity36			1
but they found no headstone for the soldier			0
this prompted an investigation by mr @entity2 , who found his fallen comrade ’s name on the @entity54 at the @entity54 in @entity55			1
this site is 370 miles from @entity17 on mainland @entity18 and lists more than 4,000 @entity58 soldiers who took part in the @entity18 campaign but whose graves are not known			1
fallen : after the war , the bodies of @entity64 ( grave left ) and lance corporal @entity23 ( right ) were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 now , despite the passing of seven decades , mr @entity2 said he can pinpoint to within a few yards the location of the grave he placed the serviceman in with the help of a stretcher bearer			1
with the @entity76 ’s backing , he is urging @entity18 authorities and the @entity78 to now bury @entity36 with full military honours			1
they also want to trace the family of @entity36 , who was in the 1st battalion @entity82			0
mr @entity2 , from @entity83 , @entity84 , said : ‘ last year friends of mine were going to @entity17 and asked them to look up the three men killed in action at @entity89 in @entity41			1
‘ they came back and said they had only found two graves			0
we researched his name and realised it was on the @entity54 as “ no known grave ”			0
nowhere to be seen : when the friends of @entity15 lance sergeant @entity2 visited the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , they could not find any headstone for @entity4 site : it had been presumed that @entity36 was also re-buried at the @entity100 after a funeral following his death at @entity89 in @entity41 , before the @entity43 , but his grave is not there ‘ well , i know where his grave is because i buried him in a ditch that we were holding as a position			1
it was the only time i have buried somebody in my life			2
i am hardly likely to forget it			0
the successful push into @entity18 began in @entity17 in july 1943 , which led to the collapse of @entity18 dictator @entity116 's government			1
the @entity17 invasion , which faced relatively little resistance , was the beginning of the @entity121 invasion of @entity123 - controlled @entity122			1
allied forces made it into mainland @entity18 by september that year , landing in the south , and the @entity18 agreed to surrender			2
but the @entity127 set up huge defensive lines to block any push north , and the @entity121 attack proved to be long - running and costly			2
however the @entity131 managed to break through and captured @entity132 in june 1944 , two days before @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			0
@entity127 's forces in @entity18 surrendered on may 1945 , six days before the whole country did so			2
‘ i put a marker on the grave			2
he must still be there			0
the @entity142 have told me that if a body is discovered they can arrange for a proper burial and a headstone			0
‘ somebody needs to go and find him for that to happen			0
he needs a proper burial and proper grave			0
’ the three men were killed when a 16 - man patrol was sent out towards high ground in @entity41 to make contact with the @entity127			1
as they neared the enemy line @entity127 machine guns opened up			0
mr @entity2 and a stretcher bearer recovered a mortally - wounded @entity36 and carried him back to a dressing station 400 yards away , where he died a few minutes later			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the men had been mown down by machine gun fire and @entity4 had been shot			1
two stretcher bearers were told to recover him but one of them was too frightened so i went			0
‘ the @entity127 were very fair and did n’t fire on us and allowed us to bring @entity4 back to the ambulance			2
he was in a lot of pain and was delirious			0
attack : scenes during the @entity43 in @entity27 , as @entity15 troops pick their way through the ruins of the @entity18 village of @entity54 , where @entity36 is commemorated on a memorial ' we could n’t do anything for him and he died at the ambulance			1
we buried him out of sight in the ditch			2
' the @entity127 were very fair and did n’t fire on us and allowed us to bring @entity4 back to the ambulance			2
he was in a lot of pain and was delirious			0
we could n’t do anything for him and he died at the ambulance			2
we buried him out of sight in the ditch ' @entity2 on @entity188 ‘ i was very upset as he was a friend and it was probably due to the trauma that i forgot to take his identity tags and personal possessions of him			1
i think he had a ring on his finger			0
i do n’t know why he was n’t found			0
’ details of where dead soldiers ended up were often recorded contemporaneously in the regimental war diaries			0
after the fighting had moved on or even after the war had finished the @entity142 located as many men as possible and buried them in local war cemeteries			2
but due to the ‘ fog of war ’ , the records were sometimes missing or incomplete and many men were forgotten about			0
successful mission : file pictures of the @entity17 invasion in 1943			2
the three men were killed when a 16 - man patrol was sent out towards high ground in @entity41 to make contact with the @entity127 @entity214 spokesman @entity213 said : ‘ mr @entity2 believes that he can still locate @entity4 ’s grave and desperately wants to see his comrade buried beside his friends before he dies			1
it is right that he should be properly buried			0
’ @entity219 , of the @entity142 , said : ‘ if a set of remains were discovered and confirmed to be a @entity58 serviceman they would be presented to us for proper burial			0
we would mark the grave and care for it			0
