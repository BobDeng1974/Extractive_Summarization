by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 07:01 est , 28 december 2012 if you are looking for a way to raise more money for charity , science has a simple answer : go blonde			1
donors to charities give nearly a quarter more if they are approached by a blonde fundraiser than a brunette , a study claims			2
but be careful which families you pick			0
the same research shows that blondes receive significantly lower donations at @entity18 households			1
money spinner : blonde hair can increase the amount of donations a woman raising money for charity can solicit by as much as 23 per cent , a study claims researchers from the @entity28 , @entity26 conducted a study to investigate the effect of hair colour on the generosity of those solicited for charitable donations			1
' this study examines how a cosmetic attribute - hair colour - impacts productivity in a door - to - door fund - raising experiment , ' wrote @entity38 , assistant professor of economics , in the study published in @entity41			0
taking into account previous studies which showed how attractiveness affected earnings , professor @entity38 investigated whether similar returns are correlated with hair colour			0
he found that blonde women gained much more from their perceived good looks , but that this was only the case when they visited @entity53 households - with @entity18 households apparently unaffected by good looking blondes			1
' the returns to physical appearance are approximately 71.6 to 76.0 per cent greater for a blonde female than a brunette ( minority ) counterpart , ' professor @entity38 wrote			2
' interestingly , the returns to beauty for blonde females are driven entirely by @entity53 households			1
in fact , blondes receive significantly lower donations at @entity18 households			1
' yet there is no discernible difference across household types for both brunette and minority females			2
' unaffected : the study also showed that the extra fundraising effect of blonde hair was lost when blonde volunteers visited @entity78 - but that brunettes and ethnic minority volunteers still received as much women charged with murder who plead self defence are more likely to be perceived as guilty if have ' thick lips ' and ' smooth and harmonious facial features ' , says a study			1
the findings made by a team from the @entity90 , @entity91 , contradict the generally held stereotype that beauty deflects criminal responsibility			0
they found that in the case of a woman claiming self defence in the killing of an abusive husband , police officers were more likely to regard as innocent defendants who were described as unattractive			0
the findings also showed that women perceived as more independent and in charge of their lives were also more likely to be seen as guilty of murder			0
legal processes are ideally conducted without bias , but in reality biases influence all human judgements and looking at how these prejudices shape behaviour should help to minimise their effect			0
in the past , social psychologists had widely accepted the contention that beautiful people are less likely to be regarded as criminally responsible			0
the study looked at the amounts of money people living in @entity121 , @entity122 , were willing to contribute to the @entity123 at @entity124			0
professor @entity38 enlisted 44 volunteers to visit 1,755 potential donor households , 522 of which actually contributed money to the cause			0
however , for the purposes of the study , the research was restricted to 955 households who were approached by 23 female volunteers			2
professor @entity38 and his team took digital photos of each of these female volunteers , divided them into blondes , brunettes and minorities , and asked undergraduate students to rate their attractiveness			2
they found that households were around 13 per cent more likely to contribute when approached by an attractive female			1
however , keeping beauty a constant , findings showed that households were 23 per cent more likely to make a donation when visited by a blonde femail than a brunette who was judged just as attractive			1
however , when blondes visited minority households , findings showed the effects of their attractiveness was muted , with the effect of increasing the beauty of the blonde visitor 509.7 per cent lower than that of a brunette			1
' empirical results suggest that returns to physical appearance are , on average , greater for blonde females but depend critically on characteristics of the potential donor , ' professor @entity38 concluded .			0

blondes found to raise 23 per cent more than equally attractive brunettes
however the ' blonde effect ' is entirely driven by @entity53 donors
blondes found to receive significantly less from minority households
