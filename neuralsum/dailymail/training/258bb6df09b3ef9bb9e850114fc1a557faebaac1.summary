by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 12 april 2013 a baby was born on the bathroom floor of his parents ’ home just two hours after midwives sent them home from hospital			1
@entity8 had to be delivered by his father after his mother @entity10 was told by maternity unit staff she was ' only in the early stages ' of labour			1
the birth occurred shortly after she and husband @entity15 were turned away from the delivery suite at @entity18 , @entity19 - despite mr @entity8 making a video of her having her contractions and in obvious pain inside the maternity unit			1
mr @entity8 , 41 , a joiner , from @entity25 , near @entity26 , said : ' it is amazing and an honour to deliver my baby boy - not every husband gets to do that - but the fact is we do feel let down by the hospital			1
@entity8 was born in his parents ' bathroom after his mother @entity10 was told by the hospital she was only in the early stages of labour			1
his father @entity15 delivered him healthy : 8lb @entity8 was born with the umbilical cord around his neck , which his father had to untangle ' @entity8 should have been born the safe environment of a maternity unit - not on my bathroom floor where they were obvious dangers			1
when he came out he was born with the umbilical cord around his neck and i had to untangle it and obviously i was very worried in case he could n’t breathe			1
it was only when he cried that i could breathe a massive sigh of relief			0
' i am so annoyed and concerned for other expecting parents visiting that hospital - could you imagine what that experience could do to first - time parents - it would destroy them and could put them off having other children			0
' we were in shock a few days after it happened because it all could have gone horribly wrong			0
' mrs @entity67 's waters broke on wednesday april 2 and when she began suffering contractions , the couple headed to hospital			1
mrs @entity67 , 33 , a telesales worker , has two older sons			1
mr @entity8 added : ' @entity10 knew she was going into labour and i thought it was pretty obvious she was too - we ’re experienced with pregnancies , especially since she ’s already given birth to her two sons and i ’ve also got four children from a previous relationship			1
' but they sent us away saying the baby was n’t imminent and told us to go home and get some sleep			0
' we were very surprised at the time , but you put your faith in the professionals and we followed their advice from the hospital and they went back home to bed to try and get some sleep			0
' i drifted off to sleep but @entity10 was still suffering pain so must have got up			0
she said she was sat in the bathroom for around an hour and ran herself a bath			0
but the baby was coming - she yelled and screamed at me , " the heads here "			0
' i woke up and was thrown into the surreal situation			0
in a panic i phoned the hospital and it took around eight attempts to get hold of the midwife			0
she advised @entity10 not to go into the bath , so @entity10 got down on her knees on the bathroom floor			0
' i screamed ‘ help us the baby is coming ’ - she finally realised @entity8 was coming then and there			1
' @entity15 said @entity10 ’s sons , @entity115 , 8 , and @entity116 , 9 , along with his 18 - year - old daughter @entity117 , who lived with them , woke up to the most awful scene			1
@entity8 was born weighing eight pounds			2
the unexpected birth occurred jut two hours after @entity8 and mrs @entity67 were turned away from the delivery suite at @entity18 he said : ' they woke up to her screaming " the head ’s here " , and i did n’t know what to do			1
' we were on the phone to the delivery suite , which sent for an ambulance , but i had the baby in my hands by the time the paramedics got here			0
' it was just so surreal how it all happened - @entity10 made me watch @entity135 a few times , but it made me so squeamish			0
' had no idea how to deliver a baby so to be put in that position was terrifying			0
' we are just so relieved @entity8 was breathing because otherwise , he could have died			2
it took paramedics around 25 minutes to arrive after he was born , so anything could have happened			0
' mrs @entity67 said : ' i knew i was in labour , but they said i was n’t			1
they did n’t give me any pain relief and told me to go home and get some sleep			2
mr @entity8 said : ' it is amazing and an honour to deliver my baby boy - not every husband gets to do that - but the fact is , we do feel let down by the hospital ' it took paramedics around 25 minutes to arrive after @entity8 was born			2
staff at @entity159 ( pictured ) said it was not always possible to predict the speed of established labour ' i could hardly move in the car coming home , and an hour and a half later i was in full blown labour			1
luckily @entity8 was fine , but it could have been totally different if he came out not breathing			2
that upsets me more than anything			0
' head of midwifery at @entity18 , @entity170 , said : ' we are sorry to hear that mrs @entity67 was unhappy with the quality of care she received at @entity18			2
' it is normal practice for midwives to encourage patients who are in the early stages of labour to go home , but to keep in touch with the hospital , letting us know if there has been any changes in what they are experiencing , such as their contractions becoming stronger , their waters breaking or if they have any blood loss or concerns			1
' they can come back in to the hospital at any time , even if they have just returned home , if they start experiencing the symptoms of active labour			2
' we can not comment on mrs @entity67 case because of patient confidentiality , but will meet with her to discuss in full any concerns she and her family have , taking forward any lessons learned from that meeting			2

@entity67 , 33 , went to @entity159 in labour
despite having contractions and being in pain , maternity staff sent her home
two hours later she gave birth to 8lb @entity8 , delivered by father @entity15
he had to unwrap umbilical cord that was *wrapped* around his son 's neck
couple are angry that home birth could have gone *disastrously* wrong
