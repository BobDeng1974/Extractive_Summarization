a @entity2 court ruling could undermine legal powers used to track down terrorists , paedophiles and serious criminals , it was feared last night			1
@entity2 judges ruled that a powerful law used to force internet companies to store data about their users ’ online activities - so it can be accessed if needed during a police investigation - was excessively intrusive			1
last night the implications of the judgment were being rapidly assessed by the @entity20 , police and security agencies amid fears it could drastically undermine their ability to investigate crimes			1
threat : the ruling , which deemed powers used by internet companies were too intrusive , could undermine police investigations into serious criminals , terrorists and paedophiles ( file picture ) one @entity33 source said the ruling was ‘ potentially very significant ’			1
the ruling concerns a @entity35 directive around the storing of personal data by internet companies which came into force in 2006			1
the law allows governments and law enforcement agencies to require internet and phone companies to store information about users ’ web activities , email and phone use for up to two years			1
they are paid to do so by police and the government so that information can be used if needed for criminal investigations			0
but the @entity55 in @entity56 found that the rules ‘ interfere in a serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life ’			2
fears : the law allows governments and law enforcement agencies to require internet and phone companies to store information about users ' web activities , email and phone use for up to two years the storing and potential use of the data - without the person ’s knowledge - is likely to lead to people feeling that their ‘ private lives are the subject of constant surveillance ’ the court said			1
senior police officers said the use of such data was ‘ essential in combating serious and organised crime , protecting the public and ensuring national security			2
’ initial readings of the ruling appeared to suggest that it completely ruled out any data collection by technology firms			2
however , a spokesman for @entity90 , the trade association for internet providers said its members would continue to collect the information			2
@entity95 , @entity90 secretary general said : ‘ the @entity97 ruling has the potential for major changes to the data retention regime , however we believe that for the time being that obligations remain in place			2
‘ it is crucial that the @entity106 and @entity20 provide guidance and clarity to industry			1
’ home secretary @entity110 told mps on the @entity112 her department would ‘ look very carefully at the full implications of the judgment ’			0
mrs may said communications data had been used in ‘ every major case in the last decade ’ and was used to identify people who would ‘ cause us serious harm ’			0
civil liberties campaigners welcomed the ruling			0
@entity125 mp @entity124 said : ‘ this deeply authoritarian directive was the product of an unholy alliance between @entity130 ’s government and @entity132 bureaucrats , using @entity35 law as the fig - leaf to sanction indiscriminate monitoring of data on innocent citizens from @entity138 to @entity139			0
intrusion : the @entity55 in @entity56 found that the rules ' interfere in a serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life ' ‘ we need to arrest this erosion of personal our privacy , and make sure intrusive surveillance is focused on fighting terrorism and serious crime			0
” but assistant chief constable @entity150 , national police spokesman on electronic data , said the information was a ‘ useful tool ’ in combatting organised criminals			1
‘ we remain convinced that there is a significant role for communications interception and the acquisition of data communications in keeping the public safe , and our commitment to balancing that with our legal and human rights duties remains equally strong			1
’ one mep said the ruling meant urgent new powers were needed			0
@entity165 , home affairs spokesman for the @entity166 said the ruling should not be allowed to hamper law enforcement			0
he said : ‘ this ruling is frustrating but there are understandable privacy concerns about indiscriminate collection and retention of people ’s data			0
‘ criminals and terrorists are growing increasingly sophisticated , so law enforcement must have the tools necessary to keep up with them			0
‘ that ’s why we need a directive that balances both privacy concerns with the need to tackle a constant threat			0
