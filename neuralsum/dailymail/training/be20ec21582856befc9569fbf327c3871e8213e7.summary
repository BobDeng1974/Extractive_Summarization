a dj left with devastating head injuries in an alleyway attack has spoken of his fury that the thug who ' nearly killed him ' has had ten months slashed off his sentence			1
father - of - two @entity6 suffered severe bleeding to his brain after he was felled by a single punch from @entity10 following a dispute outside a bar in @entity13 , @entity14 last march			1
the 37 - year - old ’s injuries were so severe he was put into an induced coma due to emergency surgery to remove part of his skull , while his devastated parents were told he would probably not make it through the night			1
@entity10 , 20 , of @entity29 , was sentenced to three years and two months in prison after he admitted grievous bodily harm at @entity32 in august			1
but at a hearing at the @entity35 in @entity36 , the term was cut to two years and four months after mr justice @entity37 deemed the original sentence failed to sufficiently reflect @entity10 ’s guilty plea			1
this means if @entity10 could be out of prison in october , after serving half of his sentence			1
father - of - two mr @entity6 ( left ) suffered severe bleeding to his brain after he was felled by a single punch from @entity10 ( right ) following a dispute outside a bar in @entity13 , @entity14 last march mr @entity6 ’s injuries were so severe he was put into an induced coma due to emergency surgery to remove part of his skull , while his devastated parents were told he would probably not make it through the night mr @entity6 , a former @entity54 , hit out at the decision , saying : ' in my mind , they ’re letting someone out early who was drunk and aggressive and , even after i lay unconscious , kneeled in my blood and carried on hitting me			1
' do we really want people like that back out on the streets early ? he very nearly killed me and i do n’t think two years and four months , which he will only serve half of , reflects that			1
' mr @entity6 needed repeated surgery to treat a swelling in his brain , with bone being removed from his skull to relieve the pressure			1
mr @entity6 needed repeated surgery to treat a swelling in his brain , with bone being removed from his skull to relieve the pressure he has previously revealed how the attack had transformed his life , leaving him in need of further surgery to fit a metal plate in his head and suffering from seizures			1
he is still unable to drive to see his children @entity83 , seven , and @entity85 , four , who live with an ex partner , or to work			0
@entity10 ’s legal team had argued at the @entity35 on friday , that the sentence was too harsh in light of his youth			2
mr @entity37 , sitting with @entity92 and mr @entity93 , noted the ' life - changing and serious injuries ' sustained by @entity6			0
he said : ' the punch knocked mr @entity6 unconscious to the ground			2
' he was unable to break his fall and his head struck the ground causing him serious injuries			0
' @entity10 also punched the victim twice while he was lying on the ground unable to defend himself in what was a sustained attack			0
' however , he concluded that the original sentence failed to sufficiently reflect @entity10 ’s guilty plea , and the term to two years and four months			2
mr @entity6 , also of @entity29 , said he felt let down and was disappointed with the justice system			2
' i knew the hearing was coming up and the liaison officer was going to let me know the outcome , ' he said			0
' but i did n’t hear anything from them , so i rang the @entity113 , who rang @entity36 , and told me he ’d had his sentence cut			0
' i just feel really disappointed			0
i think it ’s completely unfair judging by the sentence i ’m having to serve myself as i try to recover			0
mr @entity6 with his children @entity83 , seven , and @entity85 , four , before the attack ( left )			1
he has been unable to drive to visit his young son and daughter following the attack and can not work ' i ’m never going to finish my sentence – i ’m never going to be completely back to normal			0
i ’ve not even had the operation to put a plate in my head yet and i hear @entity10 could be out in a couple of months			0
' his guilty plea was taken into account at the original hearing			0
the judge was going to give him four years but reduced it to three years and two months because of his guilty plea – he ’s already had a 10 month reduction , now he ’s getting a 20 - month reduction , how is that fair ? ' i just do n’t understand the judge ’s logic behind his decision			2
' you hear stories of people losing faith in the justice system but , until you ’re involved , you do n’t realise just how much it can affect victims			0
