an inventive pensioner has come up with a novel way to avoid washing up – by creating an edible spoon			0
@entity4 , 77 , believes that his invention will be particularly useful at picnics and parties but that it does have its flaws			2
mr @entity4 thought of the idea after eating canapés served on small , disposable spoons at a party			1
@entity4 , 77 , has created a range of edible spoons that he believes are very useful at picnics and parties he set about designing an edible product that could hold many picnic favourites , such as pâté , tomatoes , and strawberries			1
he made a spoon - shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pin			1
the grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown			2
he then layered them with different toppings including cream cheese , prawns and olives which he ate along with the spoons			0
he says that the four inch spoons can also be made from short crust pastry and covered in cream or yoghurt with fruit toppings , or dipped in chocolate and set in the fridge			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity44 , said the snacks will reduce the amount of plastic cutlery that has to be thrown away after a picnic , as well as cutting out the washing up			2
mr @entity4 thought of the idea after eating canapés served on small , disposable spoons at a party he set about designing an edible product that could hold many picnic favourites , such as pâté , tomatoes , and strawberries he has now set up his own company selling edible spoon making kits for £ 25 each from @entity61 mr @entity4 , a retired design engineer from @entity44 , said : ‘ i have been to various parties and social gatherings where you are served with little assorted starters on ceramic spoons to go with cocktails and drinks			1
‘ the food was obviously eaten and the spoons where washed after use			0
‘ i thought why could n't you make a spoon that can be eaten along with the canapé , it would look just as attractive and would require no extra washing up			0
he made a spoon - shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pin the grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown ‘ so i designed a cutter that would fit the shape of the spoon and started to experiment with various pastries			1
‘ the problem i found using dough was that to be strong enough to hold a filling it was far too thick , and if it was thinner it was too weak and would not work			0
‘ after many tests i found that by rolling out bread with a rolling pin the compression of the bread gave it great strength and when baked became the perfect material			0
‘ i have been getting orders for the kits from all over the world such as @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , and mostly from @entity112			0
‘ the feedback has been very flattering			0
