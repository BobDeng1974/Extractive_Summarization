mr @entity7 , who is originally from @entity36 but is now living in @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' it takes just over an hour to get to the swamp and i spent two months there on weekends and travelling up after work			2
' it 's extremely rare to see them because they nest within the trunk and any crevice in the tree is usually made by woodpeckers			2
' the adults are eight to ten inches tall and the owlets much smaller so unless you know where the nest is you wo n't see them			0
' they are so elusive they hunt at night so you have to be pretty fortunate to be able to photograph them			0
' usually people wo n't see them until they go to start flying but both parents were away from nest so when they heard me they got really inquisitive			0
' i happily waited for a long time watching them poke their heads out every 30 or 40 minutes intervals			0
