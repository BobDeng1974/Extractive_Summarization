by @entity0 published : 23:34 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 05:20 est , 24 august 2012 @entity2 's @entity1 brands the board ' hysterical ' the @entity2 's own arts editor has called the corporation 's @entity5 ' hysterical ' – as he confessed it was just like @entity2 sitcom @entity7			1
@entity9 employs a raft of executives to manage its arts coverage , including its highly paid creative director @entity13			1
however , its arts editor @entity1 has labelled the board ' hysterical ' , admitting it has completely failed to produce an ' arts strategy '			1
mr @entity1 , 46 , was the media director at the @entity18 group of galleries before he was poached by the @entity2 in 2009			2
and in damning comments , he revealed that @entity5 members - paid a combined £ 1.7million - spend much of their time deciding which arts events to avoid			1
he also compared their fruitless conversations to @entity26 satire @entity7 , in which @entity27 played the hapless leader of the @entity30 ' ' deliverance team '			1
appearing on @entity31 , mr @entity1 said : ' i also get to sit on something called the @entity2 's @entity5 , which is hysterical			2
' it 's like being on an episode of @entity7 , when people like @entity13 and all the rest of them come in			1
' we talk about the @entity2 's arts strategy			2
and there is n't one , it transpires			0
it is great fun to talk about it			0
' it really is like being in an episode of @entity7			1
there are quite a lot of conversations about what arts events people might be able to miss , not go to			0
' the arts editor likened the board to the satire @entity7 , where bumbling staff are put in charge of the @entity26 ' deliverance team ' in his surprisingly frank admission , mr @entity1 also mocked the @entity57 , originally designed as a four year programme of cultural activity in preparation for the @entity26			1
he said : ' there 's been lots of conversations about the @entity57			0
are people aware of the @entity57 ? no. @entity13 has built up a £ 6.3million pension pot on top of his total package of £ 183,300 for his role ' the @entity2 have been very involved in the @entity57			2
and then it got narrowed down to something called @entity70 , which has been very good			0
' the @entity2 's @entity5 was created in 2009 to coordinate arts commissioning across its radio , tv and online channels			0
overseen by ' arts co-ordinator ' @entity76 , its members include mr @entity13 , who has built up £ 6.3million pension pot on top of his total remuneration package of £ 183,300			1
earlier this month , mr @entity13 claimed £ 1,216.05 for taxis for the period and a total of £ 722.81 for discussions about ' projects ' and ' @entity2 films ' , although executive expenses were down four per cent			2
other key figures on the board include @entity90 controller @entity89 , who draws a £ 270,400 pay package , and his @entity26 counterpart @entity92 , paid a total of £ 235,050			1
with the controllers of @entity95 and @entity96 , director of audio @entity97 , and mr @entity1 himself - paid £ 150,000 a year - the total pay package of the board members exceeds £ 1.7million			1
describing his own role in the @entity2 , mr @entity1 appeared to have an attack of modesty			0
he said : ' it really is a fancy title for quite a straightforward job , which is to be the correspondent for the arts in the news			0
that 's really what the job is			0
' described by one @entity2 source at the time as a ' complete maverick and an eccentric ' , he had almost no journalistic experience before taking over the role			0
in the past , he has performed a one - man show at the @entity119 , during which he asked the audience to draw pictures of penises			0
the @entity2 declined to comment .			0
