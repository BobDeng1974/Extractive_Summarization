a grieving husband is building a monument of love to his late wife - a copy of the @entity5 in his garden			1
@entity7 , 77 , has used up his life saving to build the miniature 50ft by 50ft version of the iconic structure in memory of his wife @entity13			1
he embarked on the project after promising his wife , who was childless , on her deathbed that he would create something that she would be remembered by			1
it was created by the @entity29 emperor @entity28 in memory of his third wife @entity31 so far he has spent £ 10,500 of his life savings , sold off family heirlooms and raided his pension to build the 5000sq ft structure			1
he is struggling to complete the job because of a lack of money but refuses to take donations as he wants to prove his devotion to his wife , who died in december 2011			2
mr @entity7 said : ' i never had any children and my wife told me on her death bed that since we do n't have anyone to continue our name we will be forgotten			1
' that day i promised her that i will make a grave in her name so grand the entire world will remember us forever			2
' mr @entity7 can see the @entity5 from his home in rural @entity53 , @entity54 state , @entity55			1
his decision to copy it is fitting as the original structure in @entity25 was itself a loving tribute to a late wife			2
the white marble mausoleum was built in 1631 by @entity29 emperor @entity60 in memory of his third wife @entity62			2
like the original , mr @entity7 's version also houses the body of his late wife but it is made from sandstone , redstone , cement and iron			1
the former postmaster also hopes that he can be buried there next to his beloved wife			2
but work has ground to a halt after his money ran dry			0
former postmaster mr @entity7 said he is running out of money but refuses to take donations mr @entity7 promised his wife on her death bed to create something they could be remembered by mr @entity7 has used up his life savings on the project and sold his wife 's ornaments to help pay for it he said : ' i laid the foundations in february 2012			1
i used to work on it for eight hours a day including one hour for lunch			0
' but last september i had to stop because i could n't find enough money to pay people to help me with the labour			0
' so far i sold off my land worth six lakhs ( £ 7,000 ) and my wife 's ornaments for 1.5 lakhs ( £ 1,700 ) and withdrawn all my money from my pension , which totalled another 1.5 lakhs			0
' now all i can afford to spend is about one lakh a year ( £ 1,155 )			0
i can not afford anything more than that and it is not enough to sustain the building work needed			0
' all i care about is completing the structure before i die			0
' eventually mr @entity7 hopes to replicate the intricate details of the original - including sprawling fountains in front , a tree lined approach and ornate brick work			2
but currently the frail pensioner is unable to work on his dream due to the intense summer heat and a lack of funds			0
he said : ' there is a little bit of money trouble but i will not take any financial help from anyone and i will complete this structure on my own			0
' people did tell me that i should n't be wasting my money and that it would have been better spent on funding a young couples own marriage			0
the couple rarely argued and mr @entity7 said in their entire marriage they never had a large fight mr @entity7 also hopes to be buried in the mini @entity5 next to his beloved wife @entity131 said the mini @entity5 has made the area famous across @entity55 mr @entity7 poses with his cousin @entity133 in front of his mini @entity5 ' but to those people i say that this has been built in remembrance of my wife			1
' the structure has made the local area famous across @entity55 with people desperate to see the mini @entity5			1
his neighbour and cousin @entity142 said : ' this will obviously beautify our village			0
it has already made us very famous in the name of the mini @entity5			1
' it is famous across the whole of @entity55			1
he has been getting calls from people in @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and all over @entity54 asking about it and wanting to visit			0
' mr @entity7 says the next step in edging closer to completion is building a structure for the building to stand on , elevating it up off the ground			1
he said : ' me and my wife married at a very young age , but in our entire time together we never had a major fight or argument other than small quarrels			0
' even though she could not bear us a child , never did i think of marrying any other person			0
i hope we can rest in peace together in our @entity5			2
