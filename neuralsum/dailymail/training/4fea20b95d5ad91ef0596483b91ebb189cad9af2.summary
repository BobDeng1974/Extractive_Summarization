by @entity0 published : 12:22 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 4 may 2012 perched on a special red chair in her hospital bed , this was tragic @entity5 just a few days before she died			1
bright - eyed and munching on a piece of toast , she was recovering well from heart surgery			0
and although the blonde - haired one - year - old was still underweight for her age , her parents and doctors had every hope she would grow to live a full life			1
heartbreaking : @entity5 is shown here recovering from surgery just six days before she died there was no sign that just six days later she would be dead from a massive heart attack after doctors inserted the wrong size tube into her lung , causing it to collapse			1
her devastated mother @entity23 , 40 , has blamed @entity24 for her death , saying staff ignored the family ’s repeated pleas to help her			2
@entity5 ’s operation for a congenital heart condition was a success but the complications arose during her recovery			2
mrs @entity23 has told an inquest into her death she spent several days trying to warn staff that her daughter was having trouble breathing			1
tragically , on november 11 , 2009 , both of @entity5 ’s lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest			1
tragedy : @entity5 died of a heart attack after doctors inserted the wrong sized tube into her lung yesterday @entity46 @entity45 heard how @entity5 had seemed in good spirits on the paediatric cardiac ward of @entity24			1
nurse @entity49 described how @entity5 had been sitting ‘ in a high chair eating breakfast and playing ’ , in the week before she died			1
but when nurse @entity52 returned to work after the weekend , @entity5 was lying with her head in an oxygen ‘ headbox ’ to help her breathe , and being fed through a tube			2
she told the court : ‘ i have n’t got an explanation for @entity5 ’s sudden collapse , but i can tell you that in 17 years of working on @entity63 , i have seen babies having sudden and inexplicable cardiac arrests			2
’ overlooked : @entity23 told an inquest her one - year - old daughter was neglected at the hospital the coroner heard from a succession of doctors and nurses who said @entity5 ’s rapid deterioration had come as a shock to them			1
mrs @entity23 has told the inquest she begged nurses to move @entity5 into intensive care , but was repeatedly assured this was unnecessary			1
at one point , she even tried ‘ bribing ’ a nurse with £ 100 to pay more attention to @entity81 , who was born in @entity82			1
mrs @entity23 told coroner @entity84 : ‘ i could not believe that @entity5 had just been left to deteriorate			1
all along the family had expressed their concerns about @entity5 's breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs , yet nothing was done			1
‘ all she did was sleep			0
i missed my little girl so much and i felt as though i had n't seen her eyes in so long , her big blue eyes			0
’ @entity5 was born with a hole in her heart and was recovering from surgery when complications arose describing the awful moments as her daughter ’s life ebbed away , she said : ‘ i saw that @entity5 was really gasping for breath			2
‘ her eyes were panic - stricken and they started rolling back in her head			0
‘ @entity5 looked awful , she was like a fish out of water			2
she was gasping and gasping for every breath			0
’ @entity23 , seen here with a picture of her baby girl @entity5 , says the staff at @entity24 failed ' abominably ' mrs @entity23 said there were around 15 people in the room working to save her daughter			1
she said : ‘ all the time i was stroking her head and telling her she was the best wee girl in the world			0
‘ they worked on her until their hands hurt			0
all i could see was the monitor flashing [ cardiac ] arrest			0
‘ all the time i kept squeezing her hand gently just to see if she would squeeze it back			0
@entity5 never squeezed my hand back			2
it was cold and lifeless			0
‘ after 19 minutes everyone had stopped looking at @entity5 and they were now all looking at me with pity in their eyes			2
‘ at 20 minutes [ a doctor ] confirmed my worst fears			0
he said , “ sorry mum , we 've lost her			0
” ‘ and all i could think about was that i was no longer a mummy because @entity5 was my only child and she was dead			0
i was in shock and utterly devastated			0
‘ the treatment has led me to question how can the staff at @entity24 fail @entity5 so abominably ? ’ mrs @entity23 and her husband @entity140 now live in @entity141 , and have another daughter , one - year - old @entity142			1
the inquest was adjourned and is not expected to resume until september when expert medical witnesses are available .			0
