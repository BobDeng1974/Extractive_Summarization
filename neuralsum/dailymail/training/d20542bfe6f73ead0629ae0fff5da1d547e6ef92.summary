@entity0 killed three schoolchildren , a rabbi and three paratroopers police recordings of the @entity6 gunman while he was under siege suggest he was a psychopath who took ' infinite pleasure ' in killing his victims			1
@entity13 extremist @entity0 , 23 , murdered seven people including a rabbi , three children and three soldiers in three seperate scooter - bourne attacks before being shot dead at the end of 32 - hour police siege			1
but during the stand - off following the murders , @entity0 showed no remorse - and even claimed his only regret was arriving too late to kill more @entity25 outside the @entity27 school			1
in police recordings of @entity0 , leaked to a @entity30 newspaper , he boasted that the killings gave him ' infinite pleasure '			1
the @entity32 reported that @entity0 said he had no interest in being a suicide bomber and just wanted to ' see ' his victims , ' touch them ' and ' film them			1
he told police negotiators he wanted to ' have the honour of dying with a gun in my hand like a mujaheddin '			2
the @entity30 newspaper @entity41 quoted a police source as saying : ' he wanted to give himself a star role			0
' he had a narcissistic need to seem important			0
' the @entity30 - @entity45 , a known fundamentalist , had been on a @entity30 security service ' watch list ' since 2008 , was on the @entity50 no - fly list , and had attended an @entity52 training camp			0
after the first the series of attacks he was placed on a list of possible suspects but little was done to trace him until the @entity25 school massacre when he shot a teacher and his two sons , aged four and five , as well as a seven - year - old girl			0
bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of @entity0 , the self - proclaimed @entity13 extremist who killed seven people , after a 32 - hour siege scene : a general view of the block of apartments in which @entity0 was shot by police following the murders he resisted arrest for 32 hours while under siege at his council flat but was killed by gun wounds in a blazing shoot out with police last thursday			1
@entity0 , who filmed himself carrying out the executions of four @entity25 people and three @entity30 soldiers , had fought in @entity84 and was a self - styled jihadist			1
he said he wanted to kill @entity25 children in revenge for the lives of @entity90 youngsters who had died at the hands of the @entity93 army			0
@entity94 , head of @entity30 internal security service , told @entity97 newspaper : ' he ( @entity0 ) resembles no other pattern we have seen until now ... ' what he did points to a mixture of medical problems and a fanaticism than the usual career of a jihadist			2
' @entity0 's brother @entity106 , 29 , has since appeared before an anti-terrorist judge and formally charged with ‘ complicity in murder ’			1
victims : @entity111 , 30 , @entity112 , 25 , and @entity113 , 26 were killed by @entity0 last week tragic : the mother and father of @entity30 paratrooper @entity116 carry a portrait of their son as they wait for his body 's arrival at @entity124 airport in a statement read out soon afterwards , the @entity125 said : ‘ the investigations being handled by the police have established the existence of serious evidence against @entity106 corroborating , or making plausible , his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in connection with a terrorist enterprise			1
’ @entity138 has already told police interrogators that he was ‘ very proud ’ of what @entity0 did , and admitted to dining with him just before the attack on the @entity27 school in @entity6			1
his charging came as his wife , 30 - year - old @entity145 , was freed yesterday after being held for four days by anti-terrorism police			1
she said she was ' hugely relieved , but concerned about her husband			0
' the pair married religiously as @entity149 in 2006 , but had never formally wed civilly , as they would be required to do by @entity30 law			0
ms @entity152 's lawyer , @entity151 , said that knowledge of @entity155 's crimes had been ' like a bomb which exploded infront of her eyes			0
' meanwhile , @entity0 is being held up as an martyr in some quarters , with @entity25 cemeteries targeted in attacks which police are linking to the @entity164 atrocities			1
riot police have also been called to housing estates on the outskirts of major cities like @entity169 because of anti-semitic demonstrations being held in support of the 23 - year - old killer			2
there are some 500,000 @entity25 in @entity30 , and security measures around them have increased after @entity0 shot a rabbi and three children at a school in @entity6 last monday			2
there are some six million @entity149 living in @entity30 , making up the largest group of its kind in western @entity182 , but @entity13 leaders have rejected @entity0 as being utterly unrepresentative of a largely peace - loving and law - abiding community			1
the girlfriend of one of @entity0 ’s victims said she intended to marry her partner in a posthumous ceremony			2
@entity191 , 21 , has been given presidential permission to wed 25 - year - old corporal @entity112 , who was shot dead at a cash machine in the town of @entity195 , near @entity6 , this month			0
her lawyer , @entity196 , said ms @entity191 had received approval from president @entity198 for the ceremony to take place			0
corporal @entity112 , left , was shot dead by @entity0			2
his girlfriend @entity202 , right , has been given permission to wed him posthumously posthumous marriages are unusual in @entity30 , but they can be sanctioned in ‘ grave circumstances ’ , said mr @entity196			0
' i ’ve already had it done twice , for policemen ’s girlfriends , ' he said			0
' it ’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse			0
' there wo n’t be any problems with approval , and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father			0
