by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 02:52 est , 15 february 2013 illegitimate : @entity1 , former chief executive of @entity2 , told the banking commission of @entity4 and peers , said that up to half claims for compensation over mis - selling of @entity9 were ' illegitimate ' disgraced former @entity2 boss @entity1 yesterday launched an astonishing attack on the bank ’s customers , blaming bogus @entity9 claims for pushing up the compensation bill			1
@entity1 – who is widely blamed for steering @entity2 to the brink of collapse in 2008 – said up to half of claims on payment protection insurance policies were ‘ completely illegitimate ’			1
in a rare public appearance since retiring from the bailed - out bank almost two years ago , the @entity19 told the banking commission of mps and peers he was ‘ deeply regretful ’ about customers who were genuine victims of mis - selling , but blamed dishonest claimants for pushing up the compensation bill			1
and he offered no apology for the debacle , claiming @entity9 was ‘ good value for money ’			1
he said : ‘ in the great majority of cases customers received a good sales process , and received a product that suited them			0
’ and echoing the notorious boast from @entity37 boss @entity36 that bankers do ‘ @entity39 ’s work ’ , @entity1 insisted @entity2 ‘ was on the side of the angels ’ and abided by the @entity45 watchdog ’s rules			1
@entity1 ’ version of events was dismissed last night by the @entity48 , which pointed out that almost three - quarters of @entity9 complaints it receives about @entity51 are upheld in the customer ’s favour			2
the ombudsman said last october that bankers ’ complaints about bogus claims should be treated with ‘ cynicism ’			0
@entity2 has set aside £ 5.3billion so far to pay compensation to those who were mis - sold @entity9 – far more than any other bank – and is expected to earmark even more money for payouts when it announces its latest financial results on march 1			2
by the book : the @entity19 insisted @entity66 was on the side of the angels ¿ and abided by the @entity45 watchdog ¿ s rules more than £ 13billion in total has been set aside by the country ’s lenders			2
yet banks are still refusing to settle thousands of customers ’ @entity9 disputes – and as a result , subsequent complaints to the banking watchdog have soared to unprecedented levels			2
the financial ombudsman service is now being swamped by 15,000 bank complaints a week , most of which are about @entity9 and two thirds of which are upheld			0
banks have consistently accused the @entity86 of introducing tougher regulations on @entity9 and applying them to past sales			0
no apology : mr @entity1 offered no apology for the debacle , claiming @entity9 was ¿ good value for money ¿ yesterday @entity1 insisted the huge bill for mis - sold @entity9 that built up after he retired in 2011 was partly the result of a ‘ misunderstanding ’			1
‘ we thought we were on the side of the angels , ’ he said			0
‘ i believe the vast majority of the provision is due to a difference in understanding between the industry and regulator			0
’ dr @entity106 , a former @entity107 adviser , said : ‘ these comments are extremely worrying as they suggest lessons still have n’t been learned			0
