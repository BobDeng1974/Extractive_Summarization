by @entity0 published : 03:01 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 05:52 est , 19 april 2013 a teenage boy hitched a lift home from school by riding on the tailbar of a 40 tonne lorry in a dangerous stunt that ' could have killed him '			1
police said they were trying to track down the schoolboy responsible and said the stunt was ' extremely dangerous and reckless '			1
the schoolboy - who nonchalantly gave the thumbs up after leaping off the back of the truck - was today condemned by road safety officials for the prank which was caught on camera			1
the child , thought to be aged around 14 , is wearing his blue school blazer , as he foolishly jumps on the back of the lorry in @entity23 , @entity24			1
footage of the incident was captured by a front seat passenger in a car travelling behind and the 52 - second clip was posted on @entity30			1
the lorry driver negotiated a major road junction before travelling up hill along a busy road for around half a mile as the boy sat on the tailgate seemingly admiring the view			1
eventually when the @entity53 delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street			2
danger : as the vehicle climbs uphill on the main road through @entity23 , the boy continues to cling to the back risk : the lorry makes its way past parked cars with other vehicles and a bus passing in the opposite direction horror : a lorry passes in the opposite direction , left , and the boy then shortly afterwards jumps off , right the road which has small shops and terrace houses is one of @entity23 's busiest approaches , leading towards the @entity78 and towns including @entity80 and @entity81			1
today @entity82 , head of road safety at the @entity84 said : ' this is a dangerous and foolish act which could easily result in serious injury or death			1
' we urge teenagers not to give into peer pressure or to encourage others to copy this behaviour			0
' the group who filmed the video can be heard shouting : ' what 's he doing the crazy little f * * * * * ? ' calm : the boy wanders off after jumping off the lorry as if nothing untoward had happened they then add : ' are you filming it ? he must be s * * * * * * himself			1
what the f * * * is he doing ? ' the lorry passes a bus , as well as rows of parked cars as he travels at up to 30mph on the street			2
the clip with the title ' only in @entity23 ya find a little kid like this could n't believe it funny as f * * * ' has now been shared thousands of times on the social media website			1
@entity121 said : ' silly boy , if that wagon had to brake suddenly @entity125 knows what might have happened			0
' @entity127 added : ' what if he 'd fallen , not so funny if he 'd landed underneath a car			0
' @entity131 posted a message saying : ' saved himself 40p bus fare there ...			2
. bit crazy tho ... ' councillor @entity136 said it could have led to ' devastating consequences ' and he called for local head teachers to tackle the to ' prevent it becoming a craze '			0
he added : ' i also hope other young people across @entity23 are not thinking of doing anything so stupid			2
' @entity24 police said they are aware of the footage and were making inquiries to trace the boy in the video			2
inspector @entity150 , head of the @entity151 , said : ' what this young boy did is extremely dangerous and reckless			0
' it is a potentially life threatening practice that we would not support or encourage			0
pleased with himself : the boy walks off after completing his ride through the town which was condemned by road safety experts ' we know the route this vehicle took and we will now be making inquiries to ascertain who this young man was			1
' all those sharing this reckless incident on social networking sites such as @entity30 are acting inappropriately , almost encouraging other young people to do the same thing			2
' i now plan to visit schools in the area to explain the dangers involved in behaviour like this			0
' i appeal for anyone who recognises this young man to come forward and contact police			0
' a @entity182 spokesman said : ' @entity182 is aware of video footage on social media channels which shows a young schoolboy riding on the rear bumper of one of its vehicles			0
' @entity53 does not condone such dangerous and illegal behaviour which could lead to serious injury or worse			0
' we take such matters very seriously and are doing everything possible to help police with their investigations			0
' delight : the boy gives the thumbs up to the people filming in the car behind as he walks off			0
