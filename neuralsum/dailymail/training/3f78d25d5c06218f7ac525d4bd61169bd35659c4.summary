it reveals the extent of age discrimination across the @entity10 , with doctors making ‘ inaccurate assumptions ’ about patients based on their dates of birth			0
this year the government promised to end ageism in the @entity18 and introduced laws that enable the elderly to sue if they are unfairly refused treatment			1
discrimination : the elderly are being denied life - saving treatment for heart attacks and surgery following breast cancer but a report today warns that patients in their 50s are three times more likely to be offered an emergency treatment for heart attacks than those in their 80s			1
and some hospitals are refusing to offer the treatment to anyone over 75 at all			1
the procedure – a percutaneous coronary intervention – widens blood vessels and has been credited with saving the lives of up to 80 patients a year and hundreds since it was first introduced in the late 1980s			1
it involves patients being sedated , but not given a general anaesthetic , while a thin tube is inserted into their upper leg and threaded up to the coronary artery in the heart			0
this year the government promised to end ageism in the @entity18 once in place the tube is inflated , widening the blocked artery and increasing the blood flow to the heart			1
the report by the @entity59 , a healthcare information provider based at @entity61 , found that on average about 18 per cent of patients in their 80s have @entity65			2
by comparison , @entity65 is offered to 52 per cent of those in their 50s			0
@entity69 , of @entity70 said : ‘ it is unacceptable to use someone ’s age as a shortcut to deciding whether they are suitable for treatment			0
‘ everyone must be given the most effective , suitable treatment for their individual circumstances and chronological age must not be used as a cut - off date			0
’ the report also found fewer than 5 per cent of women in their 80s have surgery to reconstruct their breast after cancer treatment but almost 100 per cent of women in their 50s have reconstructive surgery			2
dr @entity91 , senior policy officer at @entity92 , said : ‘ we need to ensure that inaccurate assumptions are not being made about patients solely due to their age			0
’ the report also warned that hospital wards are becoming ‘ dangerously ’ overcrowded , raising the risk of infections and blunders by staff ideally , only 85 per cent of hospital beds should be occupied at any one time to ensure patients are treated safely			1
but most hospitals are 90 per cent full almost all the year round , rising to 95 per cent in winter			2
treatment : patients in their 50s are three times more liekly to be offered emergency treatment for heart attacks than those in their 80s @entity113 , director of research at @entity59 , said : ‘ when hospitals get full up they have to put patients in the first bed they can find and that increases the risk			1
‘ there ’s also evidence that infections become much harder to control as hospitals become fuller			0
’ meanwhile a separate report by the @entity123 warned that some patients can wait up to four days to see a consultant because they do n’t work weekends .			0
