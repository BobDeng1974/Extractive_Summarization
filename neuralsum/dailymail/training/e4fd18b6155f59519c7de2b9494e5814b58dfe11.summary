by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 14 november 2013 criticism : @entity2 may last month said @entity3 ' was neither accountable to the public nor able to speak authoritatively on behalf of the whole of policing ' a scandal - hit ‘ boys club ’ of chief constables is set to be abolished after it was severely criticised in a report last night			1
the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) faces bring broken up after an independent review found millions of pounds could be better spent elsewhere			1
retired army general sir @entity12 said its ‘ complex and unorthodox ’ structure and status as a private company is unacceptable			2
he called for its most important responsibilities to be passed to individual forces and its controversial money - spinning offshoots to be cut loose			1
sir @entity12 said the organisation is dominated by an ‘ inner core ’ of chiefs who preside over an often ‘ informal ’ body that lacks transparency and accountability			2
in its place , he said , should be a slimmed - down ‘ chief constables ’ council ’ that better reflects the views of all the most senior police officers in the country			2
the fate of @entity3 now lies in the hands of elected police and crime commissioners who commissioned the review			1
they wanted to know if the £ 4.2m taxpayer - funded organisation still has a place in the modern police landscape			2
senior figures said they would announce their decision within weeks after consulting with the government and others			2
@entity50 ’s police and crime commissioner @entity51 , one of the leading figures behind the review , said its recommendations are ‘ straight - forward and sensible ’			0
asked what would happen next , he said : ‘ it can not be rushed , we are dealing with sensitive and important areas of policing			0
‘ but there is no doubt at all that we have to improve the way things work , improve transparency and make sure we have an arrangement which fits the policing and wider environment			0
’ the @entity68 has already withdrawn its funding as responsibility for many areas of police governance were handed to the fledgling @entity73			0
in a speech last month , @entity74 said @entity3 ‘ was neither accountable to the public nor able to speak authoritatively on behalf of the whole of policing			1
’ in recent years @entity3 has been at the centre of a stream of scandals and controversy amid growing questions over its future			1
it has been criticised for spending millions on luxury @entity88 flats for its leaders and hiring former colleagues on salaries of up to £ 1,100 a day as consultants			0
the furore led to accusations from some @entity96 that it is little more than a ‘ boys club ’ for serving and retired chief officers			0
recommendations : @entity101 , chief constable of @entity103 police and vice president of @entity3 , said the report would be considered carefully in september , the @entity106 revealed its chief executive had been arrested on suspicion of theft after items disappeared from @entity3 ’s @entity111 offices			1
in his review , sir @entity12 said frustrations have been expressed over a lack of transparency on funding , as well as inadequate performance monitoring and auditing at @entity3			1
he said @entity3 ’s status as a private company is ‘ out of place ’ and it should give up its role overseeing the governance and £ 3m funding of four national police bodies			1
instead the @entity127 , @entity128 , a central freedom of information team and the criminal records office should each be run by a single ‘ lead ’ force			0
sir @entity12 said two private companies , involved in crime prevention and combating vehicle crime , as well as other profit - making activities , should be merged and run separately			0
he suggested questions remain over whether decisions made by @entity3 are always in the best interests of the public or the ‘ more particular requirements of a commercial organisation ’			1
sir @entity12 said that @entity3 ’s role for giving senior officers a ‘ professional voice of the service ’ remains , but should be replaced by a ‘ chief constables ’ council ’			1
the retired army general said the current system does not give ‘ sufficient priority ’ to finding a consensus among the large and diverse group of chiefs			0
he said : ‘ there is a sense that for pragmatic reasons there is an inner core of more experienced chiefs who have greater influence , and this causes some to sit back and let other views prevail			0
’ sir @entity12 said the police organisation is good value for money , but added that further savings could probably be made			0
he said : ‘ my recommendations highlight that @entity3 has carried out some critical and enduring functions , but there is scope for change particularly in the way that these are governed			1
’ @entity103 chief constable @entity101 , the vice president of @entity3 , said : ‘ all chief officers will want to consider his report carefully and we will work with police and crime commissioners to take forward the recommendations			2
’ ' @entity180 ' for top police chiefs may be abolished after report finds £ 4.2m used to fund it could be better spent elsewhere			0

the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) faces being broken up
critics say responsibilities should be distributed to individual forces
last month , @entity74 said the body was not accountable to the public
