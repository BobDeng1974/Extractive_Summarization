fresh from the most eye - popping @entity3 debut since @entity5 got up @entity1 noses in 1999 , @entity1 @entity0 is back to add a welcome dollop of spice to the @entity9 , which begins at the @entity10 in @entity11 on wednesday			1
at @entity12 , @entity0 took on the home crowd with his histrionic fist pumping and exhortations of joy every time he holed a birdie putt			1
when he got back to @entity1 , he was overwhelmed with congratulatory emails			1
not surprising given he registered a team - high 3.5 points , but what did take him aback was that most of them came from @entity23			2
@entity0 ( third left ) is jokingly told to be quiet at the tournament 's welcome dinner on tuesday evening @entity0 ( left ) and his caddie @entity27 look up their notes during tuesday 's pro-am at the @entity10 ‘ about five were from @entity1 and the rest were from the @entity23 crowd , ’ said the 24 - year - old			1
‘ all of them were positive			2
it ’s the one week where you can go back and forth with the crowds			2
they clearly loved the fact i gave them something to react to			2
‘ am i going to get as rowdy this week ? probably not			2
but if i am making birdies and playing well , there will be fist pumps and excitement			0
’ @entity48 , defending champion this week , acknowledged the x factor @entity0 delivers			1
‘ all credit to him for coming over because he definitely adds a dynamic , ’ he said			0
‘ he is controversial in a good way , in an @entity53 - like way			0
’ @entity0 celebrates holing a putt on the final day of the @entity55 at @entity12 last month @entity0 has been following the inquest into @entity1 ’s crushing @entity3 defeat			1
he made it clear he did n’t agree with @entity60 ’s analysis that it was all captain @entity62 ’s fault			0
‘ he was my first captain and i actually enjoyed what he did , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ honestly , for me , if we win or lose it ’s not really on what is said or anything like that			0
‘ i felt like our camaraderie was great			0
it comes down to us and how we play and unfortunately we did n’t play well enough			0
’ @entity72 's @entity48 takes a selfie with his playing partners during the pro-am event with astute analysis like that , what a shame @entity0 is n’t part of the task force appointed by the @entity82 on tuesday to look into why they keep losing			1
instead , the four players who have lost the most matches in @entity1 @entity3 history — @entity88 ( 20 ) , @entity60 ( 19 ) , @entity89 ( 17 ) , and @entity90 ( 16 ) — are all part of the task force , while @entity91 , the only winning @entity1 @entity3 captain this century , is not			1
it ’s beyond parody , is n’t it ? as for @entity0 , he will have to show some of that @entity12 form if he is to get through a group including doughty @entity99 @entity98 , in - form @entity101 @entity100 and another whose profile shot skywards following a sterling @entity3 debut , @entity105 @entity104			1
the players at this year 's @entity9 pose for a photo together on tuesday the quartet will play each other over the next three days with the top two progressing to the quarter - finals on saturday			1
@entity48 will kick off on wednesday against @entity113 @entity112 , who won the rain - curtailed @entity114 masters last week			1
@entity115 and @entity116 complete this group			0
scot @entity118 will take on @entity120 @entity119 in a good - looking match in a group that also features @entity123 and @entity125 @entity124			0
@entity126 is the standout name in the fourth group which also includes @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
the 16 - man field is divided into four groups , with two from each group progressing into saturday ’s quarter - finals after playing one another over the next three days			0
the semi-finals and final will be held on sunday			0
wednesday ’s selected tee - times 11.45am : @entity141 v @entity139 12.33pm : @entity144 v @entity142 12.45pm : @entity146 v @entity145 13.09pm : @entity149 v @entity147 .			2

the @entity9 gets *underway* on wednesday at the @entity10 in @entity11
@entity0 plays just two and a half weeks after representing @entity1 in the @entity3 at @entity12
@entity48 is defending champion this week
