president @entity0 on wednesday cut short prison time for eight drug convicts and issued pardons to twelve other federal offenders in a move designed to draw attention to his objections to mandatory - minimum drug sentencing			1
it 's unclear whether the @entity10 will issue a broader set of clemency proclamations in @entity0 last two years in office , but the news came while the nation 's attention was focused on a handful of more controversial prisoner releases : the three @entity20 spies traded to the @entity22 regime in exchange for an aging @entity25 aid worker who sat behind bars for five years			1
that move came on the front end of a day - long @entity10 focus on ' normalizing ' diplomatic and trade relations between @entity31 and @entity32			1
the 20 other recipients of presidential clemency went comparatively unnoticed			0
@entity0 's commutations were the first issued under new guidelines his administration announced earlier this year designed to cut costs by reducing the nation 's bulging prison population			2
a pardon forgives a crime without erasing the conviction , typically after the sentence has been served			0
a commutation leaves the conviction in place but ends the punishment earlier than a court has prescribed			0
that 's 48.7 per cent of all convicts in the federal system the @entity10 said the eight shortened sentences were in cases where the prisoners would have received a substantially lower sentence if they were punished today , and would have already served their time			1
@entity0 has said he wants to show leniency toward nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to double - digit federal prison terms			1
for example , @entity82 was sentenced to 30 years in 1995 when she was 27 years old for a minor role in her husband 's methamphetamine ring			0
@entity0 ordered her sentence to expire june 12 ; others will expire april 15			0
administration officials told the @entity90 that they expect @entity0 to grant more clemency petitions			2
the @entity10 says 6,561 people already have applied in the past year , compared to 2,370 the year before			1
' i think there is an awareness out there that this president is interested in granting clemency on these kinds of matters , ' @entity10 counsel @entity93 told the @entity90 the clemency policy changes are n't limited to drug offenders , who comprise about half of the roughly 216,000 federal prisoners , but the criteria make it clear they are the main target			1
to be eligible , inmates must have already been behind bars for at least 10 years , have a nonviolent history , have no other major criminal convictions , have a good behavior record in prison , and be serving a sentence that , if imposed today , would be substantially shorter than what they were given at the time			2
the old sentencing guidelines subjected tens of thousands of african - americans in particular to long prison terms for crack cocaine convictions , while saddling those caught with powder cocaine with far more lenient sentences			1
those convicts tended to be white			0
the guidelines were enacted in 1986 when crack cocaine use was rampant and considered a particularly dangerous and violence - related drug			2
under that law , a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack cocaine got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 500 grams of powder cocaine			0
@entity137 : @entity0 's clemency proclamations were buried in the day 's other prison - related news â€“ the release of three @entity20 spies in exchange for an ailing foreign aid worker imprisoned in @entity20 since 2009 the president signed the @entity146 in 2010 to cut penalties for crack cocaine offenses in order to reduce the disparity			1
but the act addressed only new cases , not old ones			0
in his first term , @entity0 commuted just one drug sentence and pardoned 39 people , leading prisoner advocates to accuse him of being too stingy with his power			2
@entity0 aides said it was because he was n't receiving more positive recommendations from the @entity162 , so he directed the @entity163 to improve its clemency recommendation process and recruit more applications from among current prisoners			2
the @entity70 has been notifying inmates of the new criteria , and the @entity163 has asked bar associations around the country to help prepare their petitions			0
deputy attorney general @entity172 , who in april announced the clemency policy changes , said in a statement that wednesday 's sentence commutations reflect a ' commitment to bring fairness to our criminal justice system			0
' ' while all eight were properly held accountable for their criminal actions , their punishments did not fit their crimes , and sentencing laws and policies have since been updated to ensure more fairness for low - level offenders , ' he said			1
the @entity10 noted @entity0 now has commuted 18 sentences , compared to 11 under president @entity190 and three in the first six years of the @entity192 presidency			1
@entity192 eventually commuted 61 , most of them in a controversial action on his last day in office			0
president @entity0 on has commuted the sentences of the following eight people convicted of drug crimes : the president ordered the commuted sentences to expire on april 15 , except for @entity201 and @entity82 on june 12			1
@entity0 granted full pardons to twelve other convicts :			0

president picked low - level drug offenders whose sentences would have been shorter if they were punished today
new clemency guidelines originally brought few requests out of the *woodwork* so the @entity163 ordered officials to *encourage* people to apply
@entity215 was little - reported because it came as the @entity10 announced the release of three @entity20 spies as part of a prisoner swap with @entity22
