a seven - year autumn has begun on the south pole of @entity4 's largest moon , scientists believe			2
an ice cloud made from an unknown material taking shape over @entity9 ’s south pole has led experts to deem that an important pattern of global air circulation on the moon has reversed direction			1
the same type of cloud has been hanging over @entity9 's north pole , but it is now fading and spring has arrived there , according to observations made by an infrared spectrometer on @entity24 's @entity23 craft			1
@entity25 : an ice cloud made from an unknown material taking shape over @entity9 's south pole has led experts to deem that an important pattern of global air circulation on the moon has reversed direction ‘ we associate this particular kind of ice cloud with winter weather on @entity9 , and this is the first time we have detected it anywhere but the north pole , ’ @entity24 spokesman @entity34 said			1
@entity23 first observed the circulation pattern when warm air from the south was rising high in the atmosphere and getting transported to the cold north , where it cooled down and formed ice clouds			1
experts had long expected a reversal of this circulation when @entity9 's north pole began to get hotter and its south pole started to cool down			1
the official transition in the north happened in august 2009			0
but with each season on the moon lasting around seven - and - a - half earth years , researchers were still unsure when the reversal would happen and how long it would take			0
montage : this image shows @entity60 in the forefront , @entity4 rising behind , @entity62 and @entity63 fading in the distance to the right , @entity66 and @entity67 off @entity4 's rings to the left , and @entity9 in its distant orbit at the top however the first signs of a reversal appeared in data early last year , which showed the southern autumn was beginning and a swirling polar vortex could be seen at the south pole			1
despite this new activity the southern ice cloud was yet to appear , but it was eventually spotted in july 2012 , according to a study published in @entity81 in december last year			2
' we associate this particular kind of ice cloud with winter weather on @entity9 , and this is the first time we have detected it anywhere but the north pole ' @entity24 spokesman @entity34 @entity23 participating scientist @entity88 said : ‘ this lag makes sense , because first the new circulation pattern has to bring loads and loads of gases to the south pole			1
' then the air has to sink			0
the ices have to condense			0
and the pole has to be under enough shadow to protect the vapors that condense to form those ices			0
’ @entity102 @entity101 of @entity24 added : ‘ what 's happening at @entity9 's poles has some analogy to @entity106 and to our ozone holes			2
and on @entity106 , the ices in the high polar clouds are n't just window dressing			0
‘ they play a role in releasing the chlorine that destroys ozone			0
how this affects @entity9 chemistry is still unknown			2
so it 's important to learn as much as we can about this phenomenon , wherever we find it			0
