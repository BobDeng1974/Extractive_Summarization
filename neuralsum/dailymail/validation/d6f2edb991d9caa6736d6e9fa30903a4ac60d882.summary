in may of this year the @entity0 will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years , as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before			1
and if one scientists gets his way , one of these searches could involve looking for dark matter - one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the cosmos			2
he proposes that the @entity13 boson itself - which gives particles their mass - could disintegrate into dark matter , and he ’s hoping the team at @entity20 can prove his theory			1
according to dr @entity28 ’s model the @entity13 particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter dr @entity28 from @entity32 in @entity33 and two colleagues came up with the new particle model to predict the existence of dark matter			1
the current ‘ @entity43 ’ of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level , but it ca n’t account for dark matter in the universe			1
dr @entity28 ’s model , though , contains more ‘ elementary particles ’ - the smallest known to exist - than the @entity43			2
this includes dark matter particles			0
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			0
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe			0
and his model also gives the @entity13 particle different properties , suggesting that it can disintegrate into a photon ( a particle of light ) and particles of dark matter			1
to prove his theory , though , he needs a particle accelerator - and it seems that @entity20 is willing to conduct such an experiment			0
two independent experimental stations - @entity90 and @entity91 - at the @entity0 are looking for the very properties of the @entity13 particle his model predicts			2
if the properties are there , it is a clear indication that the model fits			1
‘ it 's a dream for a theorist in particle physics , ’ said dr @entity28			1
‘ [ the ] @entity0 is the only place where the model can be tested			0
it 's even nicer that two independent experiments are going to do it			0
' the current ‘ @entity43 ’ of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level , but it ca n’t account for dark matter in the universe ( illustrated )			1
dr @entity28 ’s model , though , contains more ‘ elementary particles ’ than the @entity43 - and crucially it includes dark matter particles in may of this year the @entity0 will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years , as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before			1
pictured is the @entity90 experiment at the @entity0 , one of two instruments trying to prove - or disprove - dr @entity28 's model in the first studies the volume of data was unfortunately too small for it to be possible to either confirm or reject @entity28 's model			1
‘ but we are already in full swing with new analyses in which we are testing his model in other ways and with more data , ’ said dr @entity130 at the @entity91 experiment at @entity20			2
‘ we congratulate @entity28 for having done an important job			0
’ after being closed down for a time for an upgrade , @entity0 will start up again in the spring of 2015			0
with higher energies in the accelerator , the experiments will finally gather sufficient data to evaluate dr @entity28 's model properly			2
‘ if the model is found to fit , it would completely change our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature , ' he said			0
' if not , just the fact that they are willing to test my model at @entity20 is great			2

dr @entity28 from @entity32 in @entity33 has proposed a new model for particle physics
he says the @entity13 can disintegrate into dark matter
the team at the @entity0 in @entity20 will be testing his theory
if the properties are there , it is a clear indication that the model fits
' just the fact that they are willing to test my model at @entity20 is great , ' he said
the @entity0 is to be turned on at full power in may after a wait of two years
