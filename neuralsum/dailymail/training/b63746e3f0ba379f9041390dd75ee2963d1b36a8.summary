by @entity0 for parents , the possibility of a child falling into a pool unattended and drowning is a very real and concerning threat			1
so to put their mind at ease , one company has designed a headband that alerts a parent ’s smartphone if a child accidentally falls in water			1
by syncing with an @entity17 device , the sensor sends a warning via @entity19 and lets the adult come to the aid of their child as quickly as possible			1
the £ 58 ( $ 99 ) @entity31 alerts parents when their children have fallen into a pool			1
it can also let parents know when their kids have been underwater too long			1
in both instances an alarm is sent to the parent 's phone to warn them the waterproof device is known as the @entity31 and costs aroun $ 99 ( around £ 60 )			1
@entity31 is a small , wireless sensor that is worn either as a headband or a wristband says thecompany			0
the sensor is paired with a compatible @entity19 - enabled smart device running the free @entity31 app. when both the sensor and app are activated , the app continually monitors the status of the sensor			1
if the app determines that the sensor has been submerged into water , or submerged for a ( user - definable ) dangerous period of time , it notifies the caregiver via audiovisual alerts			2
the caregiver can then investigate the circumstances and intervene if necessary			0
the device apparently has a battery life of hundreds of hours of active monitoring			0
it has an effective range of 100 feet ( 30 metres ) or more			1
it sits around the head of a child and has a bluetooth - enabled sensor at the front			0
there is also a wristband option available			0
the wristband version is designed for children who are non-swimmers and fall into a pool by mistake			2
when the device detects the child has fallen into water , it sends an alert immediately to the parent so they can come and rescue them			2
the headband version , meanwhile , is designed for slightly older children who are able to swim			0
it detects when a child has been underwater for too long , perhaps because they are struggling to swim to the surface			0
in this instance an alarm will again sound on the phone , alerting the parent to come and save their child			2
the waterproof @entity19 device has a range of about 100 feet ( 30 metres )			1
it attaches around the head of a child and has a sensor at the front			0
there is also a wristband option available up to eight @entity110 can be synced to any one @entity17 device			0
speakers can also be linked to provide louder alerts			0
however , the company adds that it is important the parent knows the general location their child is in , as the device does not have gps , although this is something they to add in future			2
' @entity31 is the world 's first wearable sensor designed to alert you with an audible / visual alarm on your smartphone or tablet ( and linked speakers ) if a swimmer has been submerged dangerously long , or if your non-swimmer enters the water , ' the company says on their website			1
' while nothing can replace diligent human supervision , @entity31 provides you and your loved ones with an added layer of protection around water			0
