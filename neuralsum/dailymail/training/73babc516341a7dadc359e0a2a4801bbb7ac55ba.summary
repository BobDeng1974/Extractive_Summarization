a remarkable six weeks in the life of @entity1 started with a controversial tweet , has contained a sustained surge in form and is set to end with qualification for @entity7 's season - end finale next month			1
his opening match in the @entity10 , versus @entity12 @entity11 on wednesday , will come 41 days after he more than hinted at his support for @entity15 independence - and in the intervening time he has won eighteen matches and three @entity18 titles			1
the inevitable reaction to his last gasp , ultimately futile intervention in the referendum debate is clearly not something he wants to dwell on			0
while he doubts the whole episode sparked something inside of him â€“ winning is always the best way to regain whatever lost popularity - he admits that is one conclusion to draw			0
@entity1 sprays celebratory champagne after his victory in the @entity37 final the win in @entity39 was the third tournament victory for @entity1 in less than six weeks ' i do n't know , i personally have n't looked at it like that , but results could suggest that , ' said @entity1 on tuesday , contemplating his swift rise to become the year 's fifth best player to date			1
he admitted that the first tournament of this run , at @entity50 in @entity51 , was particularly difficult as he successfully strove to win a first title since @entity53 2013 after leaving a storm behind at home			2
yet the main reasons for his late season improvement lie more prosaically in increased faith in his body and confidence from winning			2
' it ( @entity50 ) was a tough week for a number of reasons , ' he said			0
' but i knew that after the @entity64 i needed to start winning again and that 's why i said i wanted to start playing tournaments , whether smaller or not			1
' if i was n't beating guys that were inside the top 20 in the world i did n't care , i just wanted to win			2
then i started beating top - level opposition , which i was n't early in the year			0
@entity1 speaks to the media on tuesday ahead of his first appearance at the @entity10 he says the wins in @entity50 , @entity74 and @entity37 have been tough but built confidence @entity1 says confidence has come from ' winning a lot of tough , long , close matches , especially the finals ' ' it 's been a long six weeks , but it 's been very beneficial for me			1
i gained a lot of confidence in my body again from playing this much , and then also from winning a lot of tough , long , close matches , especially the three finals			1
' he explained his comments at @entity90 , where he had sounded indifferent about qualifying for the @entity91 at the @entity92			1
' i was n't thinking much at the @entity37 , i was just more interested in trying to get myself back into the top eight players in the world , because for the seedings at the major events at the beginning of next year it makes a big difference			0
' the price has been paid in physical pain and the accumulation of miles around @entity51 and @entity103			0
the most severe reaction followed his epic win in sunday 's @entity37 final against @entity108			1
@entity1 and @entity108 embrace after an epic final at the @entity18 500 @entity111 final @entity108 give @entity1 the double bird in jest after blowing five match points in the final in @entity37 , just like he did when the @entity116 got the better of him in the @entity50 tournament decider ' my whole body was sore , my back , my hips just aching , and i was cramping too in the final so the muscles hurt			1
ice baths make a huge difference , my body feels different once i 've been in one , after the ceremony on sunday night we got in the ice bath back at the hotel before flying here , and the aches and pains sort of calmed down			0
' i 've been feeling really bad in the evenings but waking up in the mornings feeling pretty good			0
my body is clearly getting used to playing matches and recovering well , which at the beginning of the year was n't the case			2
in my first event in january i was in bits after playing for an hour			0
' how his system reacts against @entity141 is hard to predict , but the points on offer would be useful for achieving the feasible goal of finishing this year ranked no 4			0
as far as @entity7 qualification is concerned , all the mathematics this week are on his side .			2

@entity1 faces @entity11 at the @entity10 on wednesday
