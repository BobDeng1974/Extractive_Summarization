by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 13 october 2013 an infant just five weeks old became the youngest organ donor in @entity3 , saving a woman dying of kidney failure			1
the tiny organs were transplanted into @entity7 after the child died of heart failure			1
miss @entity7 , a 22 - year - old healthcare assistant , said : ‘ words can not express the gratitude i feel to the parents of this baby			1
my life was standing still – now i can live it			0
saved : @entity7 , 22 , received a kidney from the youngest donor in the @entity3 , a 5 - week - old baby ‘ they have lost so much more than i can ever comprehend			1
their only solace is that someone else has been able to carry on with their life			0
it is a massive gift			0
’ the seven - hour operation was carried out at @entity25 in @entity26 by surgeon @entity27			1
he said that previously there had been a cultural taboo about using donors so young but that consensus is being swept away due to a chronic shortage of donors			2
kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb so could technically be transplanted into an adult from that time			1
mr @entity27 said : ‘ for a number of years , there has been a mental block about using such tiny kidneys , a feeling that they would be too small and not work			2
‘ there was also a cultural thing among surgeons that we had never used this age group , because of the emotional difficulty of asking parents of a young baby if they were willing			1
but there is such an acute shortage of organs , that we are now prepared to do this , and this case , i hope , shows that it can work			0
’ pain - staking : the seven - hour transplant was carried out by surgeons at the @entity25 in @entity26 , pictured , and has now been declared a success after six months of monitoring the @entity3 @entity61 is considering the use of organs from ' beating heart ' babies			1
these are children being kept alive on ventilators but are certified as brain dead			0
a working group set up by the @entity70 is working with the committee to discuss the controversial method			0
the practice , already used in adults and older children , allows medics to use a greater number of organs - particularly the heart and small intestines - as they can be maintained while the patient is kept alive on a ventilator			2
with a decision on the method is expected within six months			2
after the baby died earlier this year following a major infection , mr @entity27 was told that the parents wanted to donate the baby ’s kidneys , which were only 4cm long			1
miss @entity7 , from @entity89 , had suffered more than 90 per cent renal failure due to a genetic condition that caused cysts to damage her kidneys beyond repair			1
she spent nine hours every night on a dialysis machine			0
after six months of careful monitoring , the operation has been declared a success			1
the kidneys are functioning well and have grown to 7cm , with the potential to reach 75 per cent of adult size			2
miss @entity7 , who works at @entity102 in @entity89 , plans to get married next year – something she never wanted to do while on dialysis			1
she said in an interview : ‘ i remember the time the call came through			0
it was 1.48am … then i found out it was a child who had died and i felt so sad			2
i thought about the parents and how much they wanted to donate and i knew i had to have the operation , even though i was scared			0
’ @entity112 , of the @entity70 , said organ donation from babies is an important step when there are more than 7,000 people on transplant waiting lists			0
he said : ‘ this should be something we offer as a suggestion to families of dying babies … it is something positive arising from a total tragedy			0
’ the @entity3 @entity61 is considering the use of organs from babies who are kept alive on ventilators but are certified as brain - dead .			0
