by @entity0 published : 20:33 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 03:35 est , 19 december 2012 half of @entity4 's male population will be likely to face a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime by the year 2027 , experts have predicted			1
the risk of men developing the disease is expected to rise from 44 per cent to 50 per cent within the next 15 years , while women 's risk will also increase , from 40 to 44 per cent			1
around 416,000 people in the @entity13 are expected to be diganosed with cancer in 2027 , compared with 324,000 in 2010 , according to @entity15			1
risk : the proportion of @entity13 men likely to develop cancer in their lifetime will rise from 44 per cent to 50 per cent over the next 15 years , experts predict ( file photo ) the charity said one positive aspect of the bleak projections was that proportionally fewer people are likely to be dying of cancer thanks to improved methods of diagnosis and treatment			1
cancer survival rates have doubled over the past 40 years , figures show			2
the predictions from @entity15 are based on past incidence and death rates and assume a continuation of trends			2
they do not take into account new forms of treatment , lifestyle and environmental changes that might alter future cancer rates			2
' these figures provide a glimpse into the future ' dr @entity46 , @entity15 age is the biggest risk factor for cancer and the increase in incident rates largely reflects the fact that people are living longer , the charity said			1
it also revealed the cancers set to affect people most in the next 15 years are prostate , bowel and melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer			1
@entity15 's chief executive dr @entity46 said : ' these figures provide a glimpse into the future			0
' on the plus side , our life expectancy is increasing but this also means more of us are likely to be diagnosed with cancer			0
' it 's only through research that we will be able to beat cancer			0
we need to do more work to understand what drives cancer and how we can prevent it , as well as developing new treatments to reduce the number of people who will die from it , ' he said			2
' understanding the biology of cancer is rather like completing a complex jigsaw puzzle			0
many pieces have already fallen into place but we need more research before we can complete the picture			0
' and thanks to the generosity of the public , our world - class scientists are playing a leading role in beating this devastating disease			0
' devastating disease : as our life expectancy increases , more of us are expected to be diagnosed with cancer ( file photo ) data from the @entity99 at @entity100 , @entity101 and the @entity102 were used to make the predictions			1
forecasts anticipate that the number of diagnosed cases of bowel cancer will rise to more than 54,400 from 41,800 in 2010			1
the number of prostate cancer cases is expected to rise from 41,000 to 57,000 , and malignant melanoma from 12,800 to 20,400			2
prostate cancer expert professor @entity111 , from the @entity113 , said : ' prostate cancer needs research			0
we have many questions and research is key to providing answers about the disease			0
as our population ages , growing numbers of men will be diagnosed with the disease			0
' over the last 40 years prostate cancer incidence rates in @entity4 have tripled , and three - quarters of cases are diagnosed in men aged over 65 years			1
' the report was released before a new @entity128 advertising campaign launching on @entity129 that will highlight the need for more research .			0

risk of men developing cancer in their lifetime will rise from 44 per cent to 50 per cent in 15 years time , according to predictions
forms of cancer most likely to affect people are skin , bowel and prostate
around 416,000 people in the @entity13 are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2027 , compared with 324,000 in 2010 , @entity15 said
