by @entity0 for most of her life , @entity1 had been labelled mentally ill. dogged by crippling depression and memory lapses , and at times unable to read or write properly because it felt as if her brain was ‘ slowing down ’ , doctors told her she had a severe mood disorder			1
over more than a decade , the 35 - year - old solicitor was given countless drugs to ‘ cure ’ her , from antidepressants and sedatives to the mood stabiliser lithium – usually given for mania			1
but nothing touched the ‘ unbearable fog ’ that left her unable to work full - time			0
for , in fact , there was a simple but overlooked cause			0
@entity1 has the little - known – but surprisingly prevalent – @entity21 , an extreme form of @entity23 brought on by a hormonal imbalance			1
raising awareness : @entity1 , 35 , from @entity26 in @entity27 , suffers from @entity21 , an extreme form of @entity23 unlike @entity23 ’s more physical symptoms – headaches , bloating and abdominal , breast and back pain – @entity21 causes dominant emotional symptoms as well			1
period pain can be extreme and coupled with nausea and panic attacks			1
sufferers also experience suicidal thoughts , frequent crying , anger , feelings of being out of control and trouble thinking			2
symptoms typically occur in the week before a period , then go away once it starts , and are thought to be due to an increased sensitivity to the natural changes in hormone levels			1
and while @entity21 affects up to five per cent of women , many gps have never heard of it – meaning that hundreds of women are misdiagnosed with psychological disorders			1
‘ women with @entity21 often describe having a @entity57 personality , ’ explains professor @entity52 , a world - renowned expert on @entity54			1
hidden condition : @entity1 's hormonal disorder went undiagnosed for 20 years and doctors thought is was psychological , giving her drugs to treat mental illness he set up the first - ever specialist unit at the @entity65 and @entity66 in @entity67 and now runs a private practice			1
‘ about ten days before their period starts , they have this total change of personality			2
it can be very destructive , particularly to personal relationships			0
people might tell them to pull themselves together , but they ca n’t			0
‘ i have seen so many women misdiagnosed as having psychiatric disorders			2
but @entity21 is cyclical and once menstruation occurs , symptoms subside			1
this is how we know it is an endocrinological [ hormonal ] disorder , not psychiatric			2
’ @entity1 ’s symptoms started when she was 14			1
‘ my moods got worse as the years passed , ’ she says			2
‘ i could n’t have a proper social life or relationship because for half of the year i could n’t function properly			0
’ at university , she would hide away in bed when suicidal feelings struck , unable to face going out			0
her moods ruined any chance of a relationship as the men she met could n’t cope			0
‘ some days i would just lie in bed sobbing			0
it was so difficult to study when the depression struck as it would take me several minutes to make sense of one paragraph , ’ says @entity1 , from @entity26 in @entity27			1
‘ my cognitive function was so badly impaired			0
’ struggle : @entity1 's pdd symptoms started when she was 14 and got progressively worse @entity1 began suffering insomnia and night sweats in her 20s , so severe she left her job at a @entity111 law firm			1
‘ for two weeks of every month i ’d be absolutely fine			0
then for the next two weeks i ’d descend into this mental hell			0
' i had a feeling my illness was n’t what the doctors thought and asked why i was well for half of each month			2
’ @entity1 struggled on for over 20 years , seeing a series of doctors and psychiatrists who consistently failed to diagnose the right problem			1
one psychiatrist even suggested controversial electro - convulsive therapy , usually the last line of intervention for schizophrenia and catatonia			0
‘ it terrified me , ’ @entity1 recalls			1
‘ i really did n’t want to do it but i had reached the end of the road in terms of treatment so i considered it			0
i just wanted to get better			0
’ then last september one of her colleagues suggested her symptoms might be due to hormones , and something clicked			2
‘ she told me about @entity21			1
i ’d never heard of it but when i looked it up , it made sense			0
’ @entity1 ’s research led her to @entity144 at @entity54 and @entity145			1
he has conducted extensive studies into the effects of hormone therapy on @entity21 , in particular the use of the female hormone oestrogen			1
he discovered that in 94 per cent of cases , oestrogen either dramatically reduced symptoms or eliminated them			1
it was a huge breakthrough			0
he also discovered that not only are women with @entity21 intolerant of the hormone progesterone – previously used to treat @entity23 through the contraceptive pill – it actually makes symptoms worse			1
lack of exercise , stress and eating a poor diet also aggravate symptoms			2
‘ anything that halts or interferes with the menstrual cycle , like pregnancy , can stop @entity21 , ’ explains prof @entity52			1
‘ but more and more women are putting off having children , which does n’t help			2
' as women get closer to menopause , levels of oestrogen drop , which means symptoms can get worse			1
the only answer is to have a baby or a hysterectomy			0
for women who want children later , the only other option is hormone treatment			0
’ sadly , some of @entity188 ’s patients have been so desperate that they have sacrificed motherhood			0
thanks to @entity188 , @entity1 began hormone treatment – a combination of an oestrogen implant , and a coil which administers small doses of progesterone			2
she says : ‘ at last i can reclaim my life			0
i have stopped taking lithium			0
i should never have been on it			0
it does make me feel angry that there are women like me being given unnecessary drugs and being told they have mental illnesses they do n’t have			2
there needs to be a lot more awareness about this condition			0
