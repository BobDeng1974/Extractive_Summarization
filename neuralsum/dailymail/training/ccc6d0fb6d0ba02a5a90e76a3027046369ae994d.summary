a giant sculpture of a hedgehog has been unveiled on @entity2 after a survey found that a quarter of people in the @entity6 have never seen the animal in the wild			1
the 12 foot long , eight foot wide , seven foot tall structure took a team of artists two months to build , and it has been keeping hundreds of visitors to the @entity14 park entertained since being unveiled last week			1
the sculpture is mainly made from 2,000 soft wood spikes that resemble a hedgehog 's spines , and a mixture of willow and coconut fibre that takes on the appearance of fur			1
a survey for the tv channel found that millions of @entity44 claim they have never seen a large number of animals that live in the wild in the @entity6			1
the study also found three quarters were concerned about dwindling numbers of hedgehogs and thought more should be done to protect them			0
a quarter of @entity44 say they have never seen a wild hedgehog , rabbit or fox , while 26 per cent claim never to have spotted a grey squirrel or frog , and 36 per cent say wild deer have eluded them			0
the average @entity63 takes only 16 walks in the countryside each year , dramatically limiting their exposure to wildlife , the survey of 2,000 adults revealed			2
as part of the @entity39 programme , sir @entity40 studies hedgehogs and even admired a small scale model of the @entity2 sculpture before it was built			1
he said : ' the hedgehog is one of @entity44 ’s greatest natural curiosities and this sculpture is a fitting tribute to one of our best loved species			2
' ' it is interesting to note that many of our supposedly common species are also hard to spot in the wild			0
' star : the giant creature was erected to mark the launch of sir @entity40 's new @entity39 series on @entity41 channel watch tomorrow evening ' the fact that a quarter of @entity44 adults have never seen a wild hedgehog suggests that we are witnessing rapidly dwindling numbers , which is a concern			1
' hedgehogs have some interesting habits and play a very useful part in keeping down all kinds of insect pests			0
' what people do n’t know about hedgehogs is that in the wild they have vast territories , and they roam for miles on end			0
and how do they mate ? - very carefully ! ' @entity110 , one of the sculptors who worked on the project , said : ' this was my most challenging brief to date and we spent weeks replicating the skin tones and spikes to make the build as lifelike as possible			2
' as part of their work on the programme , researchers discovered that people aged 55 and over explore the countryside the most , averaging 17.6 walks per year			0
those aged 25 to 34 go on the fewest walks at an average of 12.6 , followed by 18 to 24 - year - olds at 12.9 .			0
