by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:59 am on 6th november 2011 it has become traditional for @entity3 to appear at @entity5 summits in front of both the @entity7 and the @entity9 emblem to illustrate the ‘ dual sovereignty ’ between @entity11 and @entity12			1
but now a senior @entity9 official has caused outrage by appearing to suggest that the national flags of member states should be dropped in favour of the @entity9 design of a circle of stars on a blue background			1
@entity23 , the communications director of the @entity24 , the @entity9 ’s governing body , made her comments in a speech to 650 ' spin doctors ’ from local authorities across @entity5 , including the @entity29			1
dual sovereignty : @entity3 frequently speaks in front of both the @entity7 and the @entity9 flag she called for a new , dedicated public - relations budget to help ‘ sell ’ the @entity9 as a ‘ brand ’ to its increasingly disenchanted citizens			1
the meeting in @entity12 last month , which cost taxpayers across the @entity38 tens of thousands of pounds , came as @entity9 leaders were fighting to contain the eurozone economic crisis			1
in her speech , a copy of which has been seen by @entity1 , ms @entity23 – a veteran @entity12 apparatchik – posed a series of leading questions , including how @entity5 should be defined			0
‘ are we talking about a state - to - be ? about a federation ? ’ she asked			0
then , as she flashed up a picture of @entity53 president @entity52 standing next to both a @entity53 and @entity9 flag , she said : ‘ how much do we believe in ourselves ? for how long will we see @entity55 with the @entity5 flag alongside the national flag ? if we do n’t believe in ourselves , why should the world outside do so ? ’ @entity59 and @entity52 , with their national flags and the @entity9 's last night , as @entity63 politicians accused her of calling for countries to sacrifice their national identity to promote the @entity9 , ms @entity23 insisted that she had been misinterpreted			1
one of her aides said : ‘ what is meant in this presentation is clearly not about national flags			2
on the contrary , it is part of a discussion on how better to organise the branding and visual identity of the various @entity5 institutions and agencies for which there is , at present , no overall brand architecture			2
‘ the question , “ for how long will we see @entity55 with the @entity5 flag alongside the national flag ? ” is meant to underscore the importance of the @entity5 brand being clear and simple			0
in other words the implication is , if it is not , will member states continue to use it ? ’ in her presentation , ms @entity23 also called for more money to be poured into the @entity9 ’s image as a ‘ single entity ’			1
she said : ‘ if member states do not invest enough in the @entity5 brand , a proliferation of sub-brands is sure			1
branding contributes to improving @entity5 ’s internal and worldwide reputation as a social and political entity , making @entity5 ’s achievements easy to identify for stakeholders and citizens [ and ] building a sense of common belonging			0
’ she called for more money to be ploughed into advertising the benefits of the @entity9 , adding : ‘ there is no common funding for a @entity5 communication policy			1
’ she said one should be developed ‘ to communicate on @entity5 achievements ’			0
@entity111 : ' it 's like a competition to be the most stupid ' @entity114 leader @entity111 described the plans as a further example of national identities being trampled			1
‘ this summit was a disgusting waste of taxpayers ’ money , typical of the delusional @entity9 and its staff who see any disaster as an opportunity and think that money grows on trees , ’ he said			1
‘ this organisation has recently voted to increase its budget while hard - working people struggle in a financial crisis			0
‘ their choices and priorities are so unwelcome and so unhelpful it ’s as if they are having a competition within the @entity9 to see who can be the most stupid			2
‘ i must say , the competition is looking pretty fierce			0
’ local government secretary @entity139 also entered the row last night , questioning why communications experts from @entity29 councils had been sent to the meeting to hear ms @entity23 and other experts speak			2
‘ i do n’t think it ’s appropriate that taxpayers should foot the bill for a spin doctors ’ summit in @entity12 , ’ said mr @entity139			0
‘ i can not understand what the business case is for councils attending events such as this			0
during these tough economic times , local authorities should be focusing all their efforts on protecting frontline services			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity158 , which organised the meeting , said : ‘ the event brought together communications managers from local , regional , national and @entity9 authorities to share case studies of communication activities aimed at bringing the @entity9 closer to the citizens			2
‘ when organising this event we made great efforts to keep the costs down and achieve the best possible impact with very limited resources			0
‘ the total cost amounted to around € 50,000 [ £ 43,000 ] for a two - day event bringing together 75 speakers and 650 participants			0

senior officials cause outrage by suggesting member states should drop their flags in favour of the @entity9 design
@entity114 leader @entity111 has said this is further *evidence* of @entity29 's identity being trampled
