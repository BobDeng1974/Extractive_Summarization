after a career working with some of @entity4 football ’s top clubs , @entity0 has experienced the highs and lows of management			1
on friday , as he raised his right arm high into the air to emphasise his point , @entity0 wanted it made clear to @entity12 and @entity14 columnist @entity13 that he remains at the top of his game			1
it was a low blow , calling the @entity19 analysts out because they dared to criticise @entity21 ’s players for surrounding @entity23 referee @entity22 during the @entity25 clash with @entity26			1
@entity0 opened up about the criticism aimed at his @entity21 by @entity13 and @entity12 @entity0 was in a spiky mood during a lively press conference on friday and was full of gestures @entity0 came up with another famous quip : ‘ envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man ' @entity0 claimed they were envious of his success as a coach , claiming the former @entity40 players have short memories after their careers at the top of the sport			1
the @entity21 manager said : ‘ envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man			1
‘ the difference between me and @entity12 is this : @entity12 as a player , up there ( raises arm )			1
@entity0 as a player , down here			2
@entity0 as a manager , up here			2
@entity12 as a manager , down there			2
’ with that the @entity21 manager pulled one of those faces that suggested the pair do not even belong on the same planet , let alone @entity12 having the right to pass comment on his team			1
it did not end there			0
@entity14 columnist @entity13 said the pressure @entity21 put on the referee was ' disgraceful ' @entity13 , @entity70 ( centre ) and @entity12 dissect @entity21 's exit from the @entity25 @entity0 added : ‘ i was not a frustrated man because i was not a top player			1
he is clearly a frustrated man			0
he was a fantastic player			0
i have lots of respect , in spite of some episodes , for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players			0
‘ you know the world is a bit strange — maybe with the diet and the quality of products we are eating , memories are getting shorter			0
‘ when @entity13 and @entity12 speak , it ’s because they are having a problem for sure			1
@entity13 stopped playing a couple of years ago and , in two years , he forgets everything he did on the pitch			2
mr @entity12 also , but he stopped playing a long time ago			0
‘ i coached @entity98 , i know a lot about him , so much about him			0
but i ’m a certain kind of education , not just in football but in life , and i prefer to laugh			0
’ @entity0 watches on as defender @entity104 ( left ) prepares to play a ball during training on friday @entity21 striker @entity107 keeps the ball up while sitting on the floor at the @entity111 training ground @entity21 players in training ahead of the @entity114 game against @entity115 on sunday @entity12 managed @entity98 for two years , between 1997 and 1999 ; @entity0 was the @entity117 club ’s coach for a short spell between september 2000 and december 2000			1
@entity21 ’s manager was spiky on friday , confrontational at times as he attempted to put a positive spin on a negative result in the last 16 of the @entity25			1
the guard dropped again when he claimed @entity21 would definitely win the @entity114 and he went on to make a case that they should be ‘ eight , nine , 10 , 11 or 12 points ’ clear of @entity125			1
in public he is supporting his squad , although he was less than keen to divulge details of the 30 - minute team meeting held at the training ground the day after their elimination			0
@entity12 was manager of @entity98 in @entity117 for two years , between 1997 and 1999 , before @entity0 the special one spent a brief fractious spell with the @entity137 club before moving on to better things ‘ nobody was shy , ’ was about the most he was prepared to say after he called his players together for a cathartic exercise that you can imagine ended with the squad accepting the blame			1
they certainly take responsibility for ill - discipline , with @entity0 revealing that his players pay the fines if they are charged by the authorities for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee			0
@entity21 were fined £ 30,000 by the @entity114 after they were charged following the behaviour of their players towards @entity154 on february 11			1
@entity0 , preparing for saturday 's clash with @entity115 at @entity156 , added : ‘ if they surround the referee we are charged and we have to pay a fine , and if we do that the players pay the fine			2
@entity0 revealed his players pay fines if they are charged for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee ‘ we have , in this moment , i think eight or nine months of competition and we were charged once			2
go to the @entity114 and see how many teams were charged and how many times			0
‘ everybody would love to be in our position			0
we closed the chapter on the @entity25 , but we still have the book to write			0
‘ if you want to talk about the @entity25 , speak with @entity172 or @entity173			2
we have 11 more matches to finish the book			0
let ’s see if the last page of the book is with the @entity114 trophy in their hands			0

@entity21 were criticised by @entity13 and @entity12 on @entity19

@entity0 claimed that the pair were jealous of his coaching success
@entity189 boss *refused* to reveal detail of meeting after @entity25 exit
@entity0 says @entity21 should be ‘ eight , nine , 10 , 11 or 12 points ’ clear of @entity125 at the top of the @entity114
