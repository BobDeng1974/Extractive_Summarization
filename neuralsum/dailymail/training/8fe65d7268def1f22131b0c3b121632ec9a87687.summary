this is known in the industry as ‘ shorting ’ , a process which involves borrowing shares and selling them in the hope that the price will fall and they can be bought back at a profit			2
mr @entity0 , 55 , was one of the earliest to forecast that the borrowing binge that fuelled the economy would trigger a financial crisis			1
but he came in for criticism when he was outed as one of the fund managers shorting the struggling @entity49 during the summer			2
the tactic was hugely profitable for mr @entity0 , who paid himself £ 28million after his company enjoyed a bumper year in 2008			1

but in the rarefied world of the @entity92 , he is something of a legend			0
born to a prominent @entity96 family and educated at @entity97 and @entity25 , he turned his back on a promising law career to become one of @entity31 ’s most powerful hedge fund managers			2
