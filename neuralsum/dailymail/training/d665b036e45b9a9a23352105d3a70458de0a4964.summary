by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 30 october 2013 popular building game @entity1 already lets users create their own worlds , but a new @entity5 gaming map now lets them explore the whole of the @entity7 and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens			1
@entity10 was built using @entity12 maps of the @entity7 as a base and was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game			1
it covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland @entity18 and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres			1
@entity12 used 22 billion blocks from the popular building game @entity1 to create the @entity5 interactive map of mainland @entity7 and its surrounding islands			1
the @entity1 world covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles			1
this image shows the @entity28 version of @entity29 in @entity30 this is how the @entity29 landmark in @entity30 looks in the real world to help players navigate the interactive world , @entity12 has also published a list of coordinates to various @entity7 markers , including @entity29 in @entity30			1
the map was built using @entity41 - maps and mapping tools that @entity12 lets developers use to develop alternative maps			1
@entity1 was created in 2009			0
at the start of the game , a player is put into a ' virtually infinite game world			2
' they can then walk around different terrains , including mountains , forests and caves			0
players can also fly up in the air for a birds - eye view of the landscape			0
players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities			2
as a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials			1
the game was initially made for the pc but there are now @entity70 and mobile versions available			0
for each 100 x 100 km grid square , developers from @entity12 used height information for various buildings and landmarks			1
the left - hand image shows the @entity1 version of @entity79 , while the right - hand image shows how the @entity82 mountain range looks in real - life			0
because the height of many buildings and landmarks in the @entity7 is taller than @entity1 's built - in height limit , developers scaled them down so they would fit @entity1 launched in 2009			1

the game was initially made for the pc but there are now @entity70 and mobile versions available , pictured players need a licensed copy of @entity1 and around @entity102 disk space on their pc			0
the world covers approximately 3.6gb uncompressed and needs a minimum @entity104 of memory			0
to install the map , players should download the @entity1 - @entity109 archive unzip the archive to a temporary location			0
open the readme.html file in a browser and follow the installation instructions			0
they then loaded images of all @entity7 locations from the @entity118 files			1
each 20 x 20 pixel region of the map was analysed so the developers could select the correct colour , material and size of block			1
the raw height data was stored in metres , meaning the developers were scaled down to fit within the 256 - block height limit in @entity1			1
@entity129 , for example , has a height of around 2,500 metres and this was converted into 128 blocks high			2
@entity12 said in a blog post : ' although this exaggerates the real - world height , it preserves low - lying coastal features such as @entity137 's cliffs , adding interest to the landscape			2
' developers used diamond blocks for motorways , emerald blocks for a roads and pumpkin blocks for b roads			0
water , forests and built - up areas were created using the standard water , leaves and brick blocks			0
following this , groups of 32 x 32 chunks called regions were created and assembled together			0
@entity12 said the whole process took around seven hours			2
the @entity158 in @entity159 is pictured			0
@entity12 said the whole mapping process took around seven hours to complete			2
each 20 x 20 pixel region of the map was analysed so the developers could select the correct colour , material and size of block these images show a birds - eye view of @entity170 with the @entity158 flowing through the centre , left , and a satellite view of the same area of the @entity158 , right			2
to help players navigate the interactive world , @entity12 has published a list of coordinates to various @entity7 location , available inside the game			1

@entity12 used 22 billion blocks from the popular building game
the @entity5 interactive map covers mainland @entity7 and surrounding islands
each block represents 50 square metres and the map covers the equivalent of *220,000* square kilometres
