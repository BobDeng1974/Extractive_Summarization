mr @entity0 , who has been left with two - inch gash in his stomach , cuts to his hands and a swollen ear , said : ' it 's very frightening in this day and age to think that somebody would try to kill you over a petty argument about getting a takeaway dinner			1
thugs : police have released these cctv images of the two yobs who carried out the attack ' i simply told them off because they were being being thoroughly unpleasant to the staff who were doing a good job and these guys simply over-reacted because they felt i had ' disrespected ' them by ticking them off for swearing			1
' i just do n't know what these people would stop at			2
my family could have been hurt or even killed			0
' despite his ordeal , mr @entity0 said he does n't regret confronting the yobs			1
' i was n't scared of them , ' he said			0
' i was n't going to let them behave like that			0

detective constable @entity128 of @entity123 said : ' what happened to this man was both senseless but also outrageous			0
' he intervened like any good - natured person would when they heard these two thugs verbally abusing staff , and for one simple act of kindness , he was violently attacked by these men who were clearly lying in wait to exact their " revenge "			1
' the fact they were prepared to use such violence when they must have clearly seen a young baby in the car is absolutely despicable and thankfully , though clearly by chance not design , the baby was not struck by any shards of glass			1
' what i want people to do is use the sense of anger they will feel reading about this attack and help us find the two culprits			0
we have issued two @entity160 stills , which although of not great quality , will hopefully spur someone into coming forward with information about their identity			0
