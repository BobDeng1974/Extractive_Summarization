acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle - aged people , experts said today			1
their new study found real acupuncture using needles and lasers was no more helpful than sham acupuncture			1
it specifically looked at the effects of acupuncture on chronic knee pain in people aged 50 or over			1
@entity14 , lead author from the @entity15 , said the team of researchers were surprised at their results			2
she said : ' it is surprising that our study showed acupuncture was not effective compared to sham acupuncture , because many people with chronic knee pain report that treatment with acupuncture is beneficial for their symptoms			1
' scientists in @entity31 found acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle - aged people			1
file photo previous studies has found acupuncture is effective , although the benefits compared to mock acupuncture have been generally small and of questionable benefit , she said			0
her team found many people over the age of 50 are plagued with chronic knee pain , and many turn to alternative treatments , including acupuncture			1
acupuncturists often use a combination of traditional @entity50 and @entity51 techniques with needles and low - intensity lasers			0
but the effectiveness of laser acupuncture has been questioned , the researchers said			2
to test whether needle or laser acupuncture is more effective than no acupuncture , the scientists divided 282 patients over the age of 50 with chronic knee pain and morning stiffness into four groups			1
the knee pain targeted in the study is common with osteoarthritis - the result of normal joint wear and tear over the years			2
one group received no acupuncture at all			0
another received needle acupuncture , another laser acupuncture , while the last group received sham laser acupuncture			1
patients received eight to 12 treatments over three months			0
each treatment session lasted about 20 minutes			0
the laser and sham laser treatments looked the same to both patients and acupuncturists , but the laser was not turned on for the sham group			2
the patients rated their average knee pain and physical function on questionnaires at the beginning of the study , after three months of treatment and again at one year			2
there were ' modest improvements ' in pain at three months in the needle and laser acupuncture groups compared to the no - treatment group , but not compared to the sham group			1
researchers looked at the effects of laser acupuncture , pictured , and needle treatment on 282 patients			1
file picture and there were no differences between any of the groups on measures of knee pain and function after one year			2
this suggests that there were no ' real ' or ' direct ' effects of needle or laser acupuncture , dr @entity14 said			1
the improvements patients felt were likely due to the placebo effect			0
' acupuncture tends to be more effective for people who believe in the benefits of acupuncture , ' she said			0
' in our study , people did not know that were signing up for an acupuncture study , so our participants were less likely to be ' believers ' in acupuncture , which probably explains why acupuncture was ineffective in our study			0
' the new results are very similar to those of a review of individual patient data in 2012 , said @entity140			0
dr @entity140 , who led the previous review , is an attending research methodologist at @entity143 in @entity144 and was not involved in the new study			0
the new review may have found a benefit from real acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture if the study included more people , he said			2
' about three million @entity152 try acupuncture per year , and chronic pain is the most common indication , ' he said			0
people with chronic pain should see a pain specialist , as there are many options for treatment , including acupuncture , he said			0
' as the authors suggest , the findings of this study are applicable to patients with moderate to severe persistent knee pain , and acupuncture may be effective in some people with neuropathic ( nerve related ) pain , ' said dr. @entity173 , an arthritis researcher and associate professor at the @entity176			1
the @entity178 's @entity177 does not recommend acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis , but does recommend it for persistent low back pain as it can be effective in that scenario , dr @entity173 , who was not part of the new study , said			0
as alternatives to acupuncture , dr @entity14 said physical therapy , knee braces and exercise can all help alleviate chronic knee pain			1
the new study was published in the @entity193 .			0
