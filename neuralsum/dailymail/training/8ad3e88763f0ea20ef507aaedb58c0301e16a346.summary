they went in search evidence of the world ’s melting ice caps , but instead a team of climate scientists have been forced to abandon their mission … because the @entity8 ice is thicker than usual at this time of year			1
the scientists have been stuck aboard the stricken @entity10 since christmas day , with repeated sea rescue attempts being abandoned as icebreaking ships failed to reach them			2
now that effort has been ditched , with experts admitting the ice is just too thick			2
instead the crew have built an icy helipad , with plans afoot to rescue the 74 - strong team by helicopter			0
above , @entity37 expedition leader @entity36 gives a briefing about the ice conditions yesterday professor @entity40 , leader of the @entity41 , is pictured talking to international media from the top deck of the stranded ship @entity47 @entity46 senator - elect @entity45 up early doing some stretching on the top deck of the @entity49 the expedition is being lead by @entity40 , a climate scientist , who was hoping to reach the base camp of @entity53 , one of the most famous @entity8 explorers , and repeat observations done by him in 1912 to see what impact climate change had made			1
it is thought that the group , which includes scientific researchers and a journalist , will now be able to escape by air after two sea rescues failed			0
@entity47 icebreaker @entity63 was unable to reach them because it was not strong enough to break through			1
a top - of - the - range @entity67 icebreaker , the @entity69 ( ' @entity70 ' ) , was deployed earlier in the week , and hoped to reach the ship by saturday			0
however just after midnight on friday it too got stuck just six nautical miles from the ship			1
the @entity67 icebreaker @entity70 - meaning @entity69 - was deployed to rescue the @entity77 science ship however just before midnight on friday captain @entity79 's ship ( pictured ) also became trapped scientists on board the @entity70 , including @entity82 ( left ) , are now studying the condition of the @entity77 ship while they wait to be freed themselves a photograph sent in by the captain of the @entity77 ship suggests that the two vessels can actually see each other , albeit as a tiny speck on the horizon the @entity91 set off from @entity92 on november 28 to recreate a 100 - year - old @entity94 expedition first sailed by sir @entity53 to see how the journey changes using new technology and equipment			1
but on wednesday morning , the boat hit a mass of thick ice sheets and today remains at a stand still			1
@entity40 , an @entity47 professor who helped organise the voyage on the @entity77 ship , yesterday posted a photograph on @entity104 apparently showing the @entity67 vessel , a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice			1
smile : the crew of passengers and researchers pose for a holiday photograph in the depths of @entity27 @entity116 , a passenger on @entity77 's @entity91 , is pictured watching an adelie penguin passengers waved as a helicopter sent from @entity67 's retreated @entity69 flew by to check the snow levels yesterday the researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well - stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of @entity127 capital @entity125 failed : this picture , tweeted by passenger @entity40 , shows the top - of - the - range icebreaker , @entity67 's ' @entity69 ' which also got stuck and was forced to retreat on friday trapped : 74 people , including scientists , tourists and a @entity134 reporter , are stuck in thick ice sheets crew members routinely check the hull of the ship , which gathers fresh layers of snow every night ' everyone well , ' @entity141 added			1
he said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be ' like driving your car into a brick wall '			2
just before 5am on wednesday , @entity47 deployed a @entity147 to free the group into open water			2
@entity152 vessel @entity150 was sent out for back up , alongside @entity47 's @entity63 , which is carrying food and first aid professionals			1
after two days being stranded , passengers hoped to be rescued by the @entity69 as it powered through horrific conditions			0
@entity77 's @entity91 is recreating @entity53 's 100 - year - old @entity94 expedition using new tools blizzards could hamper the rescue mission , but the ship is well - stocked and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them but on friday the heavy winds became too great , and built up an impenetrable pile of snow			1
@entity91 , an ice - strengthened ship built in 1982 , was originally used for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a passenger vessel in the @entity171 and @entity27			2
marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity125 - the capital of the @entity47 state of @entity127 - the thick ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind			1
the @entity77 embassy in @entity47 has been in constant contact with the captain and said everyone on board was in good health and there was ' no threat to their lives or safety '			0
on board are scientists from the @entity190 , a journalist from @entity134 and dozens of tourists who have paid to be part of the recreation of @entity53 ’s expedition			0
the research team has made contact with local stations from the @entity199 to say they are well - stocked with food			0
the ship had been on a multi-day tour from @entity92 to visit several sites along the edge of @entity27 before getting trapped in sea ice @entity152 's @entity206 , also deployed to save the ship , has now turned back bleak : the ship has been stranded in the barren , frozen landscape since @entity210 ' we all know that there 's a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted sit and wait , ' said @entity24 , a passenger onboard the @entity49 , speaking via satellite phone			1
' i think people are just looking at that next step when that second icebreaker arrives			0
' we really are just hoping that the two powerful icebreaker ships will provide the breakage of ice that we need			0
' however , he said the ice floes appear to have built up dramatically overnight			0
they are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets			0
a spokesman for @entity47 's @entity31 told @entity47 's @entity231 : ' it is quite a remote part of the world , but we have everyone safe			1
the vessel is n't in any immediate danger			0

@entity40 , a climate scientist and leader of the expedition , was going to *document* ' *environmental* changes ' at the pole
in an *interview* he said he expected melting ice to play a part in expedition
@entity10 still stuck among thick ice sheet 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity125 , the @entity127 capital
called for help at 5am @entity210 morning after becoming *submerged* in ice
@entity47 's back - up ship , @entity63 could not break through
