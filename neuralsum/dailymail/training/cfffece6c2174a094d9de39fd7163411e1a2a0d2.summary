the 29 - year - old @entity64 - born @entity63 said on chris - froome.com : “ the team and i will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours i will compete in			0
“ i see myself as quite a balanced gc ( general classification ) rider and the @entity10 with it ’s inclusion of a long @entity11 ( time - trial ) of 60km and tough uphill finishes will make it a well balanced race which suits me well			0
“ if i did the @entity10 i may also be able to get myself back to top shape for the @entity62 and go there with a realistic chance of aiming for the win			0
“ next year ’s @entity11 is going to be about the mountains			0
there ’s very little emphasis on time - trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains			0
“ with six mountaintop finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race			0
