@entity1 's @entity0 hopes this summer rest on the shoulders of their 22 - year - old @entity4 star @entity3			1
but can he live up to the achievements of the greatest players ever to have worn the shirt of @entity9			0
a new star : @entity3 is @entity1 's new star - but will make the list of top @entity13 10 : @entity14 ( 1964 - 77 ) captain of the best @entity1 team of all time and scored the goal that became a trademark for ' @entity20 ' @entity14 was nominally @entity1 ’s right - back in 1970 but that did n't really matter as the team developed a new style where defenders were as liable to do tricks and score goals as forwards			1
@entity14 ’s overlapping run to shoot in @entity31 ’s pass in the final against @entity33 has been re-run millions of times around the world ever since			1
besides that goal , @entity14 was a popular captain in a team of huge talent and ego			1
@entity13 feel his exclusion from the 1966 squad was the reason they failed the year that @entity44 won it			1
captain @entity14 : @entity14 played a key role for @entity1 in the 1970s 9 : @entity46 ( 1999 - 2013 ) his perennial toothy grin and array of tricks and flicks brought the joy back to @entity13 football after they ’d won the @entity0 in 1994 in a more austere manner			1
@entity46 was the ultimate playboy footballer who enjoyed life on and off the pitch			1
he exploded on to the scene at the 2002 @entity0 having arrived as a relatively unknown with @entity59 , who were n’t the major force they are today			0
manager @entity62 gave @entity46 freedom and he was the best young player in the tournament			2
his winner against @entity44 from near the touchline was condemned as a fluke by fans here , but in @entity1 they remain convinced he meant it			2
some would love to have seen him in this year ’s @entity0 squad even at the age of 34			0
box of tricks : @entity46 was a star for @entity1 for over a decade 8 : @entity74 ( 1932 - 38 ) scored 37 goals in 37 games for @entity1 and nicknamed ' the @entity74 ' as the country ’s first genuine football superstar			1
he brought a new skill to football - the bicycle kick – which earned him another nickname , @entity84			0
and he was at his peak during the @entity86 , which he top - scored with seven goals			0
in fact , if @entity74 had not been injured for the semi-final against eventual winners @entity33 , @entity1 might have claimed their first @entity0 then , instead of waiting another 20 years until 1958			2
@entity74 was small and quick , changing the assumption that you had to be big to succeed and paving the way for future superstars like @entity95 and @entity96			0
the @entity74 : @entity74 scored 37 goals in 37 games for @entity1 7 : @entity14 ( 1992 - 2006 ) full - backs are seen as hugely important positions in the modern international game – a status largely down to @entity14			1
describing the long - time @entity102 player as a left - back seems strangely insufficient			0
he was given the freedom to roam forward by @entity62 , who picked two holding midfielders to accommodate him – another trend copied by other managers since			0
@entity14 was hugely important to @entity1 ’s win at the 2002 @entity0			1
he is also regarded as the most spectacular of @entity13 free - kick takers , quite a claim			2
his most famous strike came against @entity112 at @entity113 in 1997 , a strike that was heading well past the post until it changed trajectory at the last moment			0
set piece king : @entity14 was a threat from free kicks 6 : @entity121 ( 1964 - 82 ) scored in every game of @entity1 ’s 1970 @entity0 triumph including the final – a record that remains unsurpassed			1
@entity121 was the first of the versatile attacking players , possessing the speed and trickery to be an effective winger , and the shooting power and finishing ability to be a centre - forward			2
he ’d recovered from two broken legs to take his place in the 1970 team and though @entity31 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 dictated matches , he finished the chances			0
he scored the only goal in a titanic group game against @entity44 and the third in @entity1 ’s 4 - 1 win in the final against @entity33			2
he played in the 1974 @entity0 and such was the respect for him in @entity1 , they allowed him an international send - off at the age of 38 in 1982 , against @entity148			1
in the goals : @entity121 scored in every game in the 1970 @entity0 5 : @entity151 ( 1955 - 66 ) together with @entity31 , he helped pave the way for future generations of black players to star in the modern era for @entity1			1
dubbed the @entity156 , @entity151 used a physical abnormality – one leg significantly shorter than the other – to his own huge advantage , giving him a body - swerve other wingers could n’t emulate			0
he was drafted in with @entity31 at the 1958 @entity0 – a breakthrough moment for black footballers – and together they led @entity1 to the trophy			2
four years later with @entity31 injured , @entity151 single - handedly helped @entity1 retain the cup , becoming the tournament ’s joint top - scorer in 1962			2
he is revered in @entity1 where his journey from poverty to superstardom , and problems with womanising and alcoholism , is the stuff of folklore the little bird : @entity151 helped pave the way for black players in @entity1 4 : @entity180 ( 1987 - 2005 ) a one - touch finisher par excellence , @entity180 was responsible for ending @entity1 ’s long 24 - year wait for the @entity0			1
the striker , with an extraordinary low centre of gravity , was the heartbeat of the @entity1 side that lifted the trophy in 1994			2
he perfected the toe - poke finish but arguably his most important goal came with his head – the winner in the @entity0 semi-final against @entity195			0
unlike his 1970 @entity13 counterparts , @entity180 played his club football in @entity198 and was a huge hit with @entity200 and @entity4 , whose manager @entity201 labelled him ‘ a genius ’			1
scored 55 goals in 70 games for @entity1			2
winner : @entity180 ( lifting the trophy ) played a key role in helping @entity1 win the @entity0 in 1994 3 : @entity208 ( 1994 - 2011 ) the leading @entity0 goalscorer of all - time and possibly the greatest comeback story ever told			1
the biggest superstar in the world in 1998 , the 21 - year - old suffered a mysterious breakdown - some reports suggest it was a convulsive fit - before the @entity0 final against @entity112			0
his name was scrubbed off the team sheet , then reinstated to huge drama , but he looked a shadow of his normal self in a 3 - 0 defeat for @entity1			2
the next four years were wrecked by injuries with cynics doubting he could maintain his blistering pace following a series of knee operations			0
instead , he dominated the 2002 @entity0 in @entity231 and scored both goals in the final against @entity234 to earn @entity1 their fifth and most recent @entity0			0
one of the best : @entity208 has been one of the best @entity13 in the modern era 2 : @entity237 ( 1976 - 86 ) would probably be considered on a par with @entity31 had he won the @entity0			1
unfortunately , the 1982 side he starred in blew up against @entity33 and instead gained the reputation as the greatest team never to have been world champions			0
@entity237 is undoubtedly regarded in @entity1 as the equal of the other great names in this list who have won the @entity0			1
as an all - round talent , it is hard to think of anyone his equal ; he was the ultimate creative @entity249 but also added goals , pace , set - pieces and heading to his game			0
he played in three @entity254 – @entity256 fans will remember @entity258 ’s look of disbelief as his free - kick flew into the ‘ postage stamp ’ of the goal in 1982 – but infamously missed a penalty against @entity112 in the 1986 quarter - final having just come on as substitute			0
missing out : @entity237 must be one of the best @entity13 never to win the @entity0 1 : @entity31 ( 1957 - 71 ) regarded with @entity95 as the greatest player of all - time , and with @entity267 the most internationally - recognised sportsman of all - time			1
@entity31 scored more than a thousand goals in his career and is the only player to win three @entity254 , starting in 1958 as a 17 - year - old			0
he ’s so famous , even the long version of his name @entity275 do @entity276 is known to fans around the world			0
icon : @entity31 is considered to be the best player to play the game simply the best : @entity31 won three @entity254 with @entity1 in 1958 , 1962 and 1970 due to the 1960s introduction of satellite television and boom in air travel , @entity31 became football ’s first true international superstar as @entity288 were in the entertainment world			1
he also introduced the @entity290 to soccer with the @entity292			0
the 1970 @entity0 was his zenith , featuring an attempted shot from the halfway line , his outrageous dummy against @entity295 , the @entity293 save and his hug with @entity300 that encapsulated sportsmanship			0
the @entity13 which all others – @entity3 included – have to aspire to .			1

@entity3 showed he is @entity1 's star of today , but how world he have does he *compare* to the greats ?
@entity14 , @entity121 , @entity237 all feature from the golden age of @entity13 football
@entity46 , @entity14 , @entity180 and @entity208 are the stars from the modern era to make the list
