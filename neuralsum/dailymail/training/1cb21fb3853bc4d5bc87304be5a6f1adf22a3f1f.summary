hundreds of thousands of @entity1 citizens are getting shocking letters in their mailboxes instead of tax refund checks – nastygrams informing them that the federal government has seized their money to repay debts their parents decades - old debts that they never settled			1
in some cases , they 're debts the parents never knew they had			2
and no one warned their children			0
the @entity16 included a single line that made it possible , allowing the government for the first time to hunt down individual taxpayers who have owed @entity23 money for more than ten years			1
if the debtor is deceased , according to the @entity25 , the money is considered a write - off			2
but the @entity28 has a different view of the law , chasing down adults whose parents cared for them with unintentionally overpaid benefits			1
frustrated : @entity34 and her attorney @entity35 sued the federal government for seizing money it says the @entity28 incorrectly paid her mother 37 years ago shock : @entity28 overpayments made decades ago are boomeranging on the beneficiaries ' children the @entity43 has been exercising its new authority since 2011 , bringing in $ 424 million in old debts that were previously considered out of reach			1
@entity28 says it 's identified 400,000 taxpayers whose families have owed a combined $ 714 million for ten years or more			1
every oen of those , the agency claims , will learn their fate by this summer			0
since january the government has recovered more than $ 95 million in ancient obligations			2
that 's a fraction of the $ 1.9 billion the @entity43 has seized overall in 2014 , most of it owed for a much shorter time			1
but it 's the targeting of @entity1 for their deceased parents ' decades - old delinquent @entity28 accounts – often without solid evidence of exactly who received errant payments in the first place – that has people up in arms			1
@entity28 spokeswoman @entity69 told the @entity70 on thursday that ' [ w ] e have an obligation to current and future @entity28 beneficiaries to attempt to recoup money that people received when it was not due			1
' @entity34 , a 56 year - old @entity77 employee , told the @entity70 that she received a threatening letter in march advising her that all $ 4,462 of her 2013 tax refund was seized to compensate the government for overpaying her mother @entity83 benefits in 1977			1
the bill came to $ 2,996 , but the government captured @entity34 's entire refund check			2
' what incenses me is the way they went about this , ' @entity34 said			0
' they gave me no notice , they ca n’t prove that i received any overpayment , and they use intimidation tactics , threatening to report this to the credit bureaus			0
' she sued the @entity28 authorities this week in federal court , arguing that her due process rights were violated when the government put her on the hook for a debt that allegedly traces back to her long - dead father 's benefit account			2
@entity112 senators @entity110 ( 2nd @entity113 ) and @entity114 ( @entity115 ) are demanding the @entity28 cancel debts that are more than ten years old and incurred through no fault of the person who 's currently on the hook looking for one of these this april ? check your parents ' credit reports first			1
sadly , it does n't matter if they passed away years ago the agency told the @entity70 that it always tries to contact taxpayers before seizing their money			2
in @entity131 's case , they send postcards to a po box where she has n't received mail since 1979			0
somehow , though , they knew the correct address to reach her when it was time to take her tax refund			1
@entity35 , a lawyer who took @entity131 's case pro bono , told the @entity70 that ' [ t ] he craziest part of this whole thing is the way the government seizes a child ’s money to satisfy a debt that child never even knew about			0
' ' they ’ll say that somebody got paid for that child ’s benefit , but the child had no control over the money and there ’s no way to know if the parent ever used the money for the benefit of that kid			0
' democratic senators @entity110 of @entity165 and @entity114 of @entity166 wrote to acting social security commissioner @entity167 on friday , asking for a time - out			0
' while this policy of seizing tax refunds to repay decades - old @entity28 overpayments might be allowed under the law , it is entirely unjust , ' they wrote			2
' garnishing taxpayers ’ refunds to pay for debts that are more than a decade old – and incurred through no fault of their own – is a policy that can not be continued in good conscience			0
' wants her day in court : the feds are going after deceased debtors ' children , even if the children had nothing to do with the debt in the first place in an online essay , @entity190 producer @entity189 noted that tax refund checks are now ' the new promised land for government regulators and bureaucrats desperate for more revenues			1
' the @entity199 law , for instance , was designed to use the @entity200 as a mechanism to collect penalties levied for disobeying the individual medical insurance mandate			0
the social security administration is the latest example			0
already 1,200 @entity1 have filed appeals on seizures of old debts that they say do n't belong to them			1
but they win only 10 per cent of the time			0
' we have a case of the government saying : " when you screw up , you pay			0
when we screw up , you also pay " , ' wrote @entity189 .			0

@entity43 has grabbed $ *75* million this year from @entity1 whose debts are more than 10 years old , thanks to a single line in the farm bill
many of the debts trace back to the deceased parents of the people who now see their @entity200 tax refund checks sent back to @entity228
only about 10 per cent of appeals are granted
a @entity166 woman said she lost nearly $ *3,000* because the @entity28 overpaid her mother in 1977 after her *husband* died , leaving her with five children to raise
before the farm bill *language* turned up , @entity23 could n't recover money that was owed for more than a decade
