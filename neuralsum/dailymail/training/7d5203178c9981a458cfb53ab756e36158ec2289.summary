by @entity1 reporter a 7 - year - old girl crowned @entity3 in an august 31 pageant was stripped of her crown last week by pageant sponsors who said she was n't @entity8 enough			1
@entity9 took the top prize in the pageant also known as miss @entity12 , stirring immediate outcries from some attendees because @entity9 ‘ was not the best representative of a @entity18 beauty			1
’ why ? because her skin was of a darker color than the other contestants , though sponsor @entity23 claims it was the girl ’s family ’s inability to prove the requisite ’ 25 percent latina heritage ’ that motivated them to strip her of the title			1
@entity49 reports that president of @entity51 claims the family just could n’t prove it			2
‘ her parents were asked to bring in documentation			2
of all of the documentation brought in there was nothing that confirmed @entity48 heritage , ’ @entity54 said			1
a @entity62 petition , which as of thursday evening had just under 500 supporters , contends that it was the color of @entity9 ’s skin and not her lack of provable @entity8 heritage that lost her the crown			1
‘ @entity71 has blocked her win after an outcry from people claiming that , because she is @entity76 , she is ‘ not the best representative of @entity18 beauty , ’ writes @entity67 , who started the petition			2
‘ the title is now pending while the committee ‘ investigates ’ @entity9 ’s heritage			1
meanwhile , none of the other competitors were subject to such an investigation			0
’ consolation ? @entity9 became a mere runner - up once her crown was stripped , an consolation given to all the also - rans racism ? the pageant sponsors say there was no documentation proving @entity9 's grandmother was @entity48 , as her family claimed			1
but the family and other supporters say she was treated unfairly for her black skin @entity54 , meanwhile , claims the issue has arisen before			1
she told @entity96 that when questions arise over a contestant ’s authentic @entity100 roots , her organization asks for proof			0
‘ we ca n’t have her be the queen if she does n’t have the proper documentation , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s not the first time that we ’ve been confronted with the [ burden of proof ]			0
it ’s happened in the past and they ’ve brought in the proof and we were satisfied with it			0
’ @entity54 believes it was @entity9 's family that started rumors that she was stripped of the title for being black and maintains her organization ’s decision was not racially motivated			1
‘ color has nothing to do with it , ’ she told @entity8 rebels			0
‘ we ’re all @entity123			0
that ’s why we ’re so beautiful because we come in all different colors			0
’ petition support @entity126 agreed , but wrote that she signed the petition because she sees hypocrisy in @entity9 ’s treatment			2
‘ if her ethnicity is being “ investigated , ” you need to do the same to all other contestants			2
@entity123 come in all colors – we are “ mestizos ” and @entity9 represents our @entity134 roots — she is a beautiful representative of “ @entity71			2
” @entity135 – stop the self - hate and educate yourselves on what it means to give honor to “ @entity71			0
” ’ in the end , it could boil down to a simple lack of documentation , and not a lack of @entity8 heritage , that has caused this controversy			0

‘ nothing came up , ’ @entity54 explained			0
‘ there is no information on this deceased woman			1

@entity9 's supporters claim she lost the title because of her black skin
