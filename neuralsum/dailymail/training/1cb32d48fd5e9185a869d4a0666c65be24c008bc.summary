i ’ve been at home in @entity2 in @entity3 for @entity4 , which is a rare two weeks in the @entity5 for me			1
for six months of the year i live in @entity6 , playing for a wheelchair basketball team over there			1
it ’s good to be back and see family and have some home comforts but after a week i ’m raring to get back to training			1
i live in a town called @entity13 , which is about 160 miles south of @entity14 , and play for their local team			1
it ’s obviously winter now so the weather is n’t the greatest but it ’s still much warmer than home			1
it ’s inland so we have to travel on a train or bus to get to the beach but i love living in a new place			1
i ’m learning a new culture and different customs , which is just another bonus of playing sport at this level			1
@entity30 has revealed he is ready to get back into training again after a rare week off wheelchair basketball player @entity30 , who resides in @entity6 , spent his @entity4 in @entity32 where i am it is very @entity6 , and removed from tourist resorts			1
with it being such a little town there ’s not any big brands or supermarkets			1
it ’s all little local businesses and i buy my food from a butchers and grocers which is quite nice			1
the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed , things happen when they happen , there ’s no rush			1
as nice as it is to live abroad , the main reason i ’m here is to develop my skills on the court			1
it was back in the summer of 2013 that one of the @entity6 national team players approached me while i was at a tournament and asked if i ’d consider playing in their domestic league			2
all the clubs in @entity6 get sponsored through the football clubs or the council so i can just focus on basketball rather than behind the scenes things like jobs and money			1
there ’s good international competition out here , i ’m playing against @entity6 and @entity73 players , a real mixture of players with different performance levels			2
at home i ’m always used to playing against the same person and it gets a bit stale , there ’s little opportunity to improve			2
in @entity6 , i ’m constantly being tested in training and in games			2
my team consists of five @entity32 players , three @entity87 and another five @entity6			2
the coach speaks @entity6 and @entity32 and most of the team speak good enough @entity91			2
i ’m doing two lessons of @entity6 a week			2
i ’m picking it up quite quickly in terms of understanding but the speaking is much more difficult			2
there was problems with my housing when i first got out to @entity6 so i was living with one of the other @entity32 guys but now i ’m living on my own			2
they either gave us accommodation or offered us money to find an apartment so i ’ve put money towards getting a slightly bigger place so when my family come to stay i can put them up rather than them having to stay in a hotel			0
one thing that ’s been really good in this team is that there are no big egos , we all go out for coffee or shopping together			0
it ’s great to get back in the @entity120 set up , too			0
i was part of the team that won the @entity121 in @entity122 in 2013			0
@entity30 is one of our @entity123 2016 stars along with @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 ( left to right ) @entity30 is looking forward to representing @entity120 at the 2016 @entity131 in @entity132 that was huge for our confidence levels			1
knowing that we ’ve won senior @entity135 twice ( after winning in @entity136 in 2011 )			0
we have to keep our feet on the ground but there is that element of thinking , can anyone beat us ? there ’s always a chance of getting carried away but we all know there ’s a bigger goal , we ’ve got to carry that win over and make @entity147 in 2016 a bigger win			1
the @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151 in july this year was a bit of a reality check			0
we finished seventh overall and were definitely expecting more than that			0
we went through the group stages undefeated so we were very confident but got beaten in the first knockout round			0
that gives me the drive not to let it happen again			0
after @entity151 we all had a two - week break and then did an orientation camp in @entity147			0
we had one evening where we went up to the @entity164 , which was pretty epic			0
our tour guide , who was a local bus driver , took us around the @entity168 but we were n’t allowed access to any venues but it all looked like it was taking shape			0
seeing everything made it feel a little bit more real			0
it dawned upon me that in less than two years we should be inside those buildings playing for a gold medal with the best in the world on show			0
i really believe we can win gold if everything keeps going on the same trajectory			0
money raised by @entity186 players has been changing lives for 20 years			1
£ 32 billion has gone to sport , the arts , charities and heritage projects across the @entity5			0
