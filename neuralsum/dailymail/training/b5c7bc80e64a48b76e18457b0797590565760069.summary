but to boldly go knowing that you will never return to @entity4 may be asking a bit too much			2
this has not deterred a @entity8 - led research institute , however , which has launched a search for volunteers to take part in a one - way mission to @entity13 ... where they would set up a human settlement			1
candidates must : ' be at least 18 years of age , have a deep sense of purpose , willingness to build and maintain healthy relationships , the capacity for self - reflection and ability to trust			1
they must be resilient , adaptable , curious , creative and resourceful			2
@entity20 is not seeking specific skill sets such as medical doctors , pilots or geologists			0
rather , candidates will receive a minimum of eight years extensive training while employed by @entity20			1
while any formal education or real - world experience can be an asset , all skills required on @entity13 will be learned while in training ' to apply , click here successful candidates will have to undergo eight years of training before blast - off in 2023			1
the @entity52 pulled no punches yesterday : ‘ they should realise that if this project is successful , they wo n’t be coming back			0
’ former @entity57 researcher @entity56 , @entity20 ’s medical director , said : ‘ gone are the days when bravery and the number of hours flying a supersonic jet were the top criteria for selection			0
' now , we are more concerned with how well each astronaut works and lives with the others – and for a lifetime of challenges ahead			0
’ @entity20 aims to raise money to help fund the project through a long - running , global , reality tv show , which will select the first 24 candidates and follow their training			1
viewers would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave @entity4 in ten years time			1
by 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers			0
journey time to @entity13 , which is approximately 40million miles away depending on its position in orbit , would be around 200 days			0
settlers would encounter a barren , cratered landscape , an unbreathable atmosphere made up of 95 per cent carbon dioxide and temperatures ranging from @entity87 to minus @entity88			0
the mission will begin with a landing rover set to launch in 2018 to scour the planet looking for a suitable landing site this will be followed , also in 2018 , by a supply ship carrying supplies in 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers			1
two living units , two life support units , a second supply unit , and another rover arrive on @entity13			0

@entity8 firm plans reality tv show to choose its team
