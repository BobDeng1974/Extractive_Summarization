by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 4:55 pm on 6th october 2011 a school bus driver who crushed a six - year - old boy to death when his vehicle sped out of control was jailed for 28 months today			1
@entity6 pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes on the 67 - seat @entity10 coach as @entity11 dropped off her son , @entity12 , at school			1
they both became trapped between the bus and a @entity16 outside the gates of @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , when the tragic accident happened			2
@entity22 died after he was crushed between a coach driven by @entity6 mrs @entity11 was then dragged under the coach for 30 metres until @entity6 , 52 , managed to stop			1
she suffered ' massive injuries ' to her legs , pelvis and body but @entity12 never regained consciousness , @entity25 was told			2
during the hearing @entity31 and @entity12 's father @entity32 sat in the well of the court during the hearing and wept as the court was told of the events			0
@entity6 , arriving in court today , was visibly shaken after the accident afterwards the family issued a statement : ' @entity43 was simply the most perfect son to us as parents and a wonderful big brother to @entity47			1
' from the moment he was born he has brought us all love and joy , he really was a shining star who lit up our lives each and every day			0
' on march 14 @entity12 walked hand in hand to school with his mummy , as we did each and every day , so full , as always , of excitement for the school day ahead			0
' this is my last memory of @entity12 , as within just moments of reaching the school gate , the school coach accelerated towards us , running us down			1
' in that moment our little boy 's wonderful life was ended and his family 's lives destroyed			2
' now nearly seven months on , we struggle to live our lives without him			2
he was so adored and is so missed			0
' @entity6 had only driven the coach owned by @entity69 once before and was a part - time driver who had been employed for six months by the company to drop pupils off at various schools			1
@entity6 , from @entity74 , pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving			1
moments before colliding with @entity12 and @entity31 , a tractor had scraped the side of the coach			1
he was described as ' annoyed but not angry ' before getting back into the bus			0
in the meantime , the narrow road outside the school had become blocked with a second tractor wanting to get through			2
@entity12 's parents , @entity32 and @entity11 , sobbed as they heard details of their son 's death on march 14 parents had parked further away and were walking in the @entity90 to get to the school gates			1
@entity92 , prosecuting , said : ' the second tractor driver , @entity93 , described hearing the bus rev hard three times and then continuously			1
' he could not believe the speed that the bus took off past him			0
there are quite a number of witnesses who describe the high revs and shooting off at some speed			0
' the barrister said the @entity16 was in front of the bus as it sped off			0
@entity6 was jailed for 28 months for causing @entity12 's death ' in a ghastly coincidence mrs @entity11 was leading her son by the hand behind the @entity16 just as the coach careered forward into it			1
' both were struck down			0
@entity22 received fatal injuries and did not regain consciousness			1
' mrs @entity11 suffered massive injuries			0
there was nothing whatsoever she could have done			0
she suffers survivors ' guilt but there was nothing anyone could have done			0
' a visibly shaken @entity6 was heard to say after the death that the brakes had failed on the coach			1
but the court heard it had no defects and that @entity6 had suffered sudden acceleration syndrome , a common cause of similar accidents involving automatic buses where the driver becomes confused when he presses the accelerator by mistake and not the brake and can not understand why the vehicle will not stop			2
in mitigation , the court heard @entity6 was an ordinary hard - working family man with no previous convictions			2
he accepted the coach was out of control , and gave his heartfelt sympathy to the family			1
' it was his error that caused the accident			0
he panicked and slammed his foot down on the accelerator , ' his barrister @entity147 said			0
imposing the prison term and a three - year driving disqualification , judge @entity150 accepted @entity6 's culpability in the death was low , but he said : ' the consequences of your driving come very high			2
a life has been lost at the very outset of its course and you ultimately bear the responsibility			0
