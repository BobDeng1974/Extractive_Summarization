by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 17:04 est , 6 march 2014 a world champion typist has set a new speed record - with his nose			2
@entity6 , 23 , wrote a 103 - character sentence in just 47 seconds after practicing his technique for six hours a day , the @entity5 reported			1
if confirmed it will smash the previous time of a minute and 33 seconds , set in @entity11 in 2008 by an @entity13 man who used his nose to write the same sentence : ' @entity15 has challenged me to to type this sentence using my nose in the fastest time			1
he said his trick was keeping one eye closed it took mr @entity6 , from the southern city of @entity29 , months of training to break through the 53 - second barrier after reaching it at least twice			1
during his attempts the hobbyist , his hands tied behind his back , was surrounded by crowds of fans with stopwatches and an extra-large monitor attached to the keyboard			2
videos and ecstatic press conferences after the attempts have been posted on his @entity46 feed			2
mr @entity6 already holds the @entity15 for typing the entire @entity48 alphabet - although that feat was achieved with his fingers			1
he achieved a time of 3.43 seconds during the challenge in february 2012 , which was held in front of several journalists in a public event his home city			1
he told the @entity5 : ' if you want to set a record , every millisecond counts			2
i typed with one eye closed , as it is difficult otherwise to locate the keys			0
' it is far from the most bizarre typing feat to be recorded by @entity15			2
celebration : onlookers and mr @entity6 cheer during a previous record attempt - the time is now even quicker challenge : the record setter used his nose while a crowd watched the results on a large monitor last year @entity79 @entity78 typed on a smartphone ' the razor - toothed piranhas of the genera @entity83 and @entity84 are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world			1
in reality they seldom attack a human ' in 25.9 seconds - while blindfolded			0
there is also a recorded time for typing the numbers 1 to 50 with a full stop between each one			0
@entity96 , from the @entity95 , managed the feat in 16.3 seconds at an event in @entity11 in 2009			0
@entity99 typed a 264 - character text on a mobile phone with a keyboard in 56.57 seconds in @entity103 , @entity79 , in 2011 , setting another record			1
it was : ' the telephone was invented by @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , who filed his patent for the telephone on 14 february 1876 at the @entity111 , @entity79			0
the first intelligible call occurred in march 1876 in @entity113 , @entity114 , when @entity107 phoned his assistant in a nearby room and said ' @entity117 , i want you			0
' stay back ! supporters surround mr @entity6 with stopwatches during at attempt in which he made 53 seconds the nose is also not the only appendage used			1
@entity126 amputee @entity125 typed 251 letters in alphabetical order with his feet on an @entity131 tv show in 2010 , the most ever recorded without a mistake			0
the fastest hands - free typing overall , however , goes to @entity79 @entity134			0
