his matinee - idol looks and @entity3 - like physique have possibly contributed as much to @entity5 's success as his tremulous tenor			1
but getting into this kind of shape takes hard work and no little commitment			2
indeed , @entity5 - one quarter of hunky ' popera ' group @entity12 - is a self - confessed gym addict			1
the singer joined the health club in his home town of @entity17 in @entity18 as a teenager and likes to work out every day , often twice			2
true to form , when we meet he has just come from a gruelling session of running , cycling , rowing and weights			2
@entity5 , pictured in @entity25 with his motorbike , is a self - confessed gym addict it is his first time in a gym in three months following an operation to repair a torn muscle in his right shoulder which left him unable to exercise			1
for many , the agony of such an injury would be bad enough , but for @entity5 , 42 , it threw into stark relief just how all - consuming his quest for a perfect body had become			1
he says : ' working out is such a huge part of my life , and i 'll often schedule my whole day around gym sessions ; what to eat and when to eat it			1
having that routine and purpose taken away has been psychologically hard			2
' but seeing and feeling my body change , losing my muscle definition and bulk , has been even harder			1
i enjoy the rush that exercise gives me and i enjoy the results even more , but for the past three months i 've not even been able to lift a coffee cup to my mouth			1
' though all the members of @entity12 are image - conscious , @entity5 is the most driven of the band in terms of fitness - his total gym hours amount to about 15,000 since he signed up for his first session - and he has struggled more than most people might with what is a common injury			1
he says : ' it 's important , how we look			2
a good suit can only do so much for you - the rest is up to you , and right now , due to this injury , i 'm not where i want to be			1
' though all the members of @entity12 are image - conscious , @entity5 is the most driven of the band in terms of fitness although a tear is normally associated with a shock movement , @entity5 does n't recall this happening			1
' i snowboard a lot and although i 've fallen a few times , i do n't remember a sudden jolt of pain , ' he says			2
' i was moving furniture in january last year and vaguely remember something going “ pop ”			2
it was n't excruciating , just a niggle , but as time went on , the irritating discomfort turned into a searing pain			2
' i carried on going to the gym and worked through the pain , but as it turns out , the specific exercises i was doing were the very ones i should have been avoiding : pull - downs behind the head , bench presses lower than a 90 - degree angle , and tricep dips			1
' all of these exercises make the shoulder joint very vulnerable , and if you have n't got a problem already , there is a high risk those exercises will give you one			1
' in march , @entity5 was in @entity100 where his girlfriend @entity101 , a professional gymnast who performs with @entity102 , is based			1
surrounded by athlete friends who have experienced similar injuries , he was encouraged to see dr @entity105 , a renowned orthopaedic surgeon			2
he discovered two separate injuries : the first was a tear between the place that the bicep arm muscle attaches to the labrum , a band of tough tissue that surrounds the entire socket of the shoulder joint holding it in place ( also known as a @entity123 tear ) , and another to the rotator cuff , the muscles and tendons that also surround the shoulder , controlling and stabilising movement			1
dr @entity105 says : ' i see a lot of sports people with these injuries			2
but anybody of any age can sustain it if they happen to fall badly on their arm or shoulder			1
' while @entity123 tears generally happen due to wear and tear , rotator cuff injury typically happens due to a sudden trauma			0
unlike @entity5 , most people normally know when and how they 've done it			1
' it 's a pretty dramatic injury , ' says dr @entity105			0
eventually , @entity5 found it was affecting everything he did			1
' it got to the point where any movement of my arm above a right angle to my body was impossible			0
i could n't even pick up my daughter , ' he says			0
' if i tried to swim , next day my arm would feel as if it was falling off			0
' so with dr @entity105 at the helm , in august last year @entity5 underwent a reconstructive operation to repair these two areas of the shoulder			1
these procedures used to be carried out - and still are by some surgeons - through a large incision but now the procedure can be done via tiny keyhole ' stabs ' , or so - called arthroscopic surgery			1
@entity5 's operation took a little more than an hour under general anaesthetic and was done through two small incisions			1
dr @entity105 says : ' the tissue that anchors the bicep tendon to the labrum was torn , so we had to tie it back up to where it 's supposed to be			1
we do this by drilling a hole in the bone and inserting an anchor attached suture wire , which will stay in place for ever			0
' with his arm in a sling for two weeks , @entity5 assumed that once it was taken off , he could start getting back to normal			1
' everyone kept telling me it would take three months to recover , but i did n't believe it			0
i naively thought that once the sling was off i could start doing normal things again			0
' but as soon as i took my arm out , it just fell limply beside my body			0
i was n't able to do anything with it and i was pretty freaked out			0
i could n't even wash my own hair			0
' dr @entity105 put @entity5 on an intense training programme , three times a week for ten weeks , to increase range of movement , and strengthen the shoulder			1
@entity5 and girlfriend @entity101 @entity5 says : ' i became very impatient			1
i 'd gone from being such an active person to sitting in an apartment waiting for my next physio appointment			0
i could n't even ride my motorbike because i was n't allowed to hold the handlebars			0
' but gradually , his range of movement improved and he was allowed to do gentle exercises using small weights			0
' i 'd lie down on my hotel room floor and do simple things such as lifting an umbrella , ' he says			0
' since the surgery i 've also been doing more core exercises			0
i 've pretty much got full movement back , though it 's still painful to lift my arm above my head			0
' @entity216 , an orthopaedic surgeon at the @entity217 , says these injuries are often seen in rugby players or @entity221 footballers			0
so why would something so minor as moving furniture be to blame in this case ? he suggests there could have been an older injury that caused a weakness that led to a minor incident , such as hauling coffee tables around , causing the rupture - which was then exacerbated by exercise			1
but he adds : ' there 's nothing to suggest that once you 've sustained an injury like this and had it reconstructed , you 're at a higher risk of it happening again			0
these kinds of repair are very effective and , as long as you do the right physio afterwards and take it slowly , there 's nothing to say you wo n't be back in the gym before long			1
' @entity250 's album of @entity252 songs , @entity253 , is out now			0
by @entity216 , orthopaedic surgeon the socket is encircled by a tough band of tissue called the labrum			0
this acts to deepen the socket and stabilise the joint			0
it is rather like a golf ball sitting on a golf tee			0
the large muscle at the front of the arm is called the bicep , and it has a long tendon which fits into the labrum at the top of the socket , anchoring the two together			2
this is where a @entity123 tear occurs			0
during the repair operation , instruments are used to manipulate the torn tendon back into position during the repair operation , instruments are used to manipulate the torn tendon back into position			1
the insertion point is prepared with a small drill to make a fixing point			0
the tendon is then attached to a special anchor made of surgical sutures , which is then screwed into the bone fixing the tendon back in place			0
surgery is carried out as a day case procedure with either a general anaesthetic or more commonly with a block on the nerves that supply the shoulder			2
this means the patient has no pain at the end of the procedure			0
the shoulder is immobilised in a sling for six weeks and rehabilitated with supervised physiotherapy			2
normal sporting activities can be resumed after four months			0
