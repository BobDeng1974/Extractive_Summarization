higher education minister @entity3 told @entity14 he wanted more students coming to the @entity5 , not fewer , despite admitting that the number who stay here illegally after their courses end is not known			1
he is siding with the @entity20 to insist the 250,000 students who come to @entity5 each year should be removed from the net migration figure – the difference between the number of people who arrive in @entity5 and those leaving			1
the move would render the @entity8 election pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ meaningless			2
it would also fly in the face of public opinion , with seven in ten voters wanting to see a limit on student visas , according to a poll released today			0
the @entity38 and @entity20 have been fighting over whether to maintain the system of including students in net migration figures			1
@entity43 minister @entity42 recently told @entity44 : ‘ to say that someone who comes here for three years as a student is not here and does n’t count is absurd			0
’ request : in a letter to deputy prime minister @entity14 ( pictured ) , mr @entity3 makes it clear that he wants ' no limit ' on legitimate students coming here to study given the huge number of students arriving each year , campaigners believe it would be impossible to meet the ‘ tens of thousands ’ target without slashing student visas			1
but in a letter to deputy prime minister mr @entity14 , mr @entity3 makes it clear that he wants ‘ no limit ’ on legitimate students coming here to study			2

however , estimates by the @entity43 suggest one in five do not go home at the end of their course			0
mr @entity3 ’s four - page letter , seen by the @entity76 , demands a ‘ clear commitment that the government will not seek to reduce legitimate student numbers in order to meet the net migration target and will explore ways of presenting net migration figures to make this apparent ’			1
mr @entity3 – dubbed ‘ two brains ’ for his reputation as an intellectual – acknowledges ‘ the difficulties of accurately removing students from the net migration statistics , particularly as we still lack robust data on the outflows of students from the country ’			1
public opinion : seven in ten voters want to see a limit on student visas , according to a @entity101 poll released today ( file picture ) but he adds : ‘ however , i do not believe we can justify keeping students in the net migration target on this point alone , given the widespread concern that this could result in a reduction in the number of legitimate students			2
we should be seeking to increase the numbers of legitimate students coming to study			0
’ ' we should be seeking to increase the numbers of legitimate students coming to study ' @entity3 , higher education minister he wants ministers to make a public commitment that they have ‘ no intention ’ of ever placing ‘ a cap or limit ’ on international student numbers			2

the survey , commissioned by the @entity124 think - tank , also found strong support for action against bogus students , with seven in ten saying those without sufficient @entity129 for their courses should be deported			0
