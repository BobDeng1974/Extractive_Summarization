@entity0 has defended its practice of giving customers as many breadsticks as they want , saying the policy conveys ' @entity6 generosity ' after criticism from its new hedge fund owners @entity10 's 24 - page response does n't specifically address each of @entity13 's criticisms , but states that the company is already implementing a variety of strategies to improve @entity0 's performance			1
the company says it has introduced new menu items to underscore value , for instance , and is testing ordering technologies using table - top tablets			0
@entity13 is lobbying to gain control of @entity10 's board of directors at the company 's annual meeting oct. 10			2
@entity10 , which is based in @entity50 , @entity51 , has struggled to boost sales at @entity0 with the growing popularity of chains such as @entity55 , where people feel they can get food similar in quality to a sit - down restaurant for less money			2
under pressure to boost results , @entity10 recently sold off @entity63 , which was doing even worse than @entity0			0
but @entity13 and others took issue with the sale and wanted the company 's breakup structured differently			0
@entity13 also took @entity0 to task for a litany of issues , including its failure to salt the water used to boil its pasta and even the length of the asparagus it serves as for its breadsticks , @entity13 said last week that @entity0 was being wasteful because servers were n't sticking to the policy of providing one breadstick per customer , plus an extra for the table			1
the investor said servers lacked ' training and discipline ' and were bringing out too many breadsticks at a time , which also led to cold breadsticks			0
@entity13 noted that it was n't calling for @entity0 to stop giving away unlimited breadsticks , but simply exercise more control in how they 're distributed			1
@entity13 also said servers were overfilling salad bowls and using too much dressing , which it said drives up costs			0
in its response on monday , @entity10 said that ' @entity0 's salad and breadsticks have been an icon of brand equity since 1982			2
