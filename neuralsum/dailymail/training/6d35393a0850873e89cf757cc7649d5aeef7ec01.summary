by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor on the final day of enrollment this year for medical insurance under the @entity4 , the federal government website that runs the program went offline			1
and @entity7 press secretary @entity6 found himself in the awkward position of taking a victory lap – citing enrollment totals of more than 6 million – while last - minute customers were frozen out of the system			1
@entity6 appeared rattled at the beginning of his daily press briefing , committing an unforced error that quickly attracted scorn on social media			2
' six out of ten people without insurance can get insurance for $ 100 a day or less , ' he said , instead of citing monthly prices			1
visitors to @entity30 on monday morning saw messages that the site was down for maintenance oops ! @entity7 press secretary @entity6 was rattled by the @entity4 news on monday , saying in error that some uninsured @entity1 could get coverage for ' $ 100 per day ' -- instead of ' $ 100 per month ' medical insurance enrollment fairs across the country saw an increase in participation over the weekend and on monday , putting new levels of strain on the website as volunteers enrolled people on - site @entity30 was unavailable for six hours in the early hours of monday , came back online for a half - hour , and then began connected visitors to its ' virtual waiting room , ' a program that contacts users when the website has the capacity to serve them			1
by midday , however , even that stopgap system was offline , leaving new potential enrollees with no options			2
the website appeared to return to service around 1:45 p.m. , but suffered additional glitches as late as 2:10			0
' the tech team monitoring @entity30 in real time has identified an issue with users creating new accounts , ' @entity60 spokesman @entity59 said monday			0
' the application and enrollment tools are unavailable to new users at the moment			0
the tech team is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible			0
' while the website was knocked offline , vice president @entity71 appeared in a pre-taped video interview on the @entity74 to encourage even more @entity1 to go online and enroll			0
' i think people are going to be really , really surprised how well this has turned out , ' he said			0
' get in the queue , now			0
there is still time today			0
' the @entity7 blamed its online problems on a crush of last - minute customers , including more than 8.7 million web visitors in the last week and 1.2 million on saturday alone			1
@entity6 reminded reporters in his afternoon briefing that due to a last - minute policy shift unveiled last week , anyone who manages to begin the enrollment process will be permitted to finish it at a later date			1
he compared the situation to long lines on @entity95 , and the generally accepted practice of allowing people to vote if they 're in line when the polls close			1
but the @entity7 's new policy only requires insurance - seekers who missed monday 's midnight deadline to check a box and claim that they tried in earnest to enroll in time			1
@entity6 parried a question about how many previously uninsured @entity1 will be covered because of @entity4 , and how many of them were newly insured after @entity4 's strict minimum requirements caused the cancellation of their previous policies			1
' in some cases it 's kinda hard to measure this , ' he said , because the insurance marketplaces 's normal ' churn ' regularly eliminates some policies every year anyway			2
what to do ? @entity1 have struggled with online signups and call centers , leading tens of thousands to flood in - person events staffed by ' navigator ' volunteers people using the healthcare.gov website have encountered tech glitches as everyone entering the system -- including millions of new @entity130 enrollees -- competed for scarce computer resources on the final day more than six million @entity1 have chosen health insurance plans on healthcare.gov and websites run by 14 states and the @entity136 , but the question of how many have actually paid for coverage is a thorny one he also boasted on monday that the six - month enrollment total for @entity4 policies will be ' significantly above 6 million , ' but declined to say – as he has many times before – how many of those enrollees have actually become insured by paying their premiums			1
' we do n't have those figures , ' he insisted			0
estimated compiled by @entity148 from states that report such numbers indicate that as many as one out of five subscribers have n't paid , lowering any @entity7 numbers by 20 percent			1
that would take a possible 6.5 million enrollment total down to 5.2 million			2
@entity157 are counting on @entity4 's dysfunctions – not just the enrollment roadblocks , but higher costs , limits on care and smaller physician networks – for a political windfall in november			2
' we 're not really going to know whether [ @entity4 ] worked or not until the third or fourth year			0
and of course , that 's two elections down the road , @entity136 and @entity169 professor @entity168 told @entity170			0
' what i worry about is that we wo n't be able to figure out whether it 's worked or not until it 's too late			1
' @entity7 senior adviser @entity175 said sunday on the @entity176 ' that the @entity157 will fail in its bid to parlay @entity4 's failures into a sweep and a takeover of the @entity181			2
' i think the @entity157 playbook of just repeal @entity4 , repeal @entity4 , repeal @entity4 gets tougher as more and more people get health care , ' said @entity175			0
' i think smart @entity157 understand that			0

more than six hours of website outages *plagued* healthcare.gov on the last day for enrollment , *harkening* back to the system 's *disastrous* *october* 1 launch
@entity7 spokesman @entity6 makes stressed - out epic gaffe : ' six out of ten people without insurance can get insurance for $ 100 a day or less '
administration claims enrollment numbers ' significantly above 6 million , ' but still wo n't say how many have paid
@entity6 *defended* the new policy of allowing people who have started the signup process to complete it later
