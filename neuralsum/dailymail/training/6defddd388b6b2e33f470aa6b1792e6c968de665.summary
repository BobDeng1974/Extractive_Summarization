by @entity0 a @entity2 lawyer has declared he is willing to starve himself to death in front of the @entity5 unless he gets national recognition for his campaign to stop employers firing staff because of embarrassing or controversial social media posts			1
@entity11 , 31 , who is on the fifth day of his hunger strike in @entity13 , is currently camped out in front of the court sitting on a sun lounger with an umbrella to protect himself from the sun. the @entity20 law school graduate wants a 90 second slot on a national television news network to gain exposure for his fight to legally separate the personal and professional lives of @entity27 citizens - and he claims he is willing to die on the sidewalk of the capitol if he does n't get it			1
protest : @entity11 outside the @entity5 in may - where he is currently conducting a hunger strike that will not cease unless he gains 90 seconds of national television news coverage @entity11 , who achieved a level of notoriety last year for circulating emails to hundreds of law firms with a photo of himself in a t - shirt showing off his biceps in an effort to get a job , is no stranger to social media fouls			1
he followed that up by posting a @entity45 photo of himself shirtless while holding up a sign that read ' @entity47 ! no … as a lawyer , damn , not an escort … wait is it something i ’m wearing ? ' he has said he was also fired as a high - school tennis coach for comments he made online about an opposing player and when media checked his open @entity45 profile after his unusual attempt to get hired last year they found several near - naked photographs			2
however , @entity11 does not think any of this should interfere with his or anyone else 's career			2
' we have @entity27 being fired everyday from coast to coast in almost every single state for simply doing completely legal things like having a beer after work or expressing an opinion that just does n't happen to fly with the boss , ' said @entity71 to @entity72 @entity11 , wants laws that legally prevent any employers from firing their staff for social media content or opinions			1
' i believe that every single @entity27 has the right to be off the clock , ' said @entity11 , who graduated with a degree in social media law , to @entity72 ' i do n't believe that anyone should feel that they live in a 24 - hour - a - day , seven - day - a - week job interview			1
' i do n't believe that anyone should be told that they 're the face of a company at 4 a.m. on a dance floor , ' said @entity11			2
' welcome to the gun show : last year @entity11 attached this photo ( left ) of himself to job search emails that he sent to hundreds of attorneys across @entity2 and his public @entity45 page revealed this ( right ) baffling job solicitation as well - which led to his application and profile being shared online @entity11 is carrying a sign that has a tally of how many days into his hunger strike he is and is constantly updating his @entity45 page as to his protest 's progress			1
' @entity106 - 12:48 am ( 3 days , 4 hours , and 49 minutes into my @entity106 ) ' wrote @entity11			2
' this really has been a hellish evening			0
my sign was ruined by the rain			0
i 'm huddled under this umbrella making it very difficult to work			0
' water keeps getting on my macbook and creeping close to the generators			0
' earlier on wednesday night , @entity11 admitted the smell of his clothes after three days without changing had become too much and said he was going to change - but not to eat			2
fiery : @entity11 's @entity45 profile page is filled with humorous pictures he has photo - shopped his half - naked picture onto discrimination : the law graduate wants the @entity5 to prohibit employers from firing staff for ill - judged social media posts ' i want to be very clear about this			1
i am leaving the @entity5 for a bout 60 - 90 minutes to go back to the @entity131 and take a shower and shave and change my clothes , ' posted @entity11 to @entity45			1
' honestly , i know it 's disgusting but i 'm starting to smell after three entire days in the sweltering heat and no shower			0
' and i want to brush my teeth			0
i do n't like being unclean and its embarrassing when people take pictures with me and i stink			0
' claiming that @entity27 is sleeping walking into an orwellian dystopia unless it faces facts on social media , @entity11 says he has more public support than has been acknowledged			1
' a dirty little secret is that the majority of @entity27 does n't see me as an outsider or a wierdo , but as a man willing to speak truth directly in the face of a foolhardy status quo , ' wrote @entity11 to his @entity45 page on wednesday			2
freedom : the social media law graduate wants the professional and private lives of citizens to be firmly established in law @entity161 : @entity11 wants all social media posts to exist separately and be protected from employer 's eyes his mantra is ' coverage or @entity167 ' and @entity11 admits that his particular method of drawing attention to this issue will split opinion among the media			1
' i 'm not going to lie			0
it feels good to draw publicity to a cause i 've been fighting for and dedicating my life to , ' wrote @entity11 on tuesday			0
' but i admit to also taking sick personal satisfaction in getting the coverage i knew i 'd get ... directly in the face of so many people who said no one would care about me or my message			0
' @entity11 , who lists himself as self - employed at his own blog www.brianzulberti.net has been traveling the country to raise awareness of those fired because of their social media updates or postings			1
@entity190 blow : @entity11 has declared he will not stop his hunger strike unless he gets the exposure he wants he was recently in @entity194 to discuss the case of @entity196 , who worked for the @entity197 and was fired for writing homophobic posts			1
@entity11 , who told the @entity199 he is ' about as gay as the day is long ' , said he disagrees with the man , but does not think he should have been fired			2
indeed , @entity11 is adamant his message will be heard			0
dismissing an interview with the @entity199 as not high - profile enough , @entity11 said he wants national television exposure			1
only that will stop him from continuing his hunger strike			1
' i want a major tv network , ' he told the @entity199			0
' i want 90 second spot on a major network during prime time			0
yes , if you were from @entity213 and you said @entity214 will air you tonight , i would pack up my signs and leave			0
