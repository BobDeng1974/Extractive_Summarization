by @entity0 the @entity1 is being flooded with cheap heroin from @entity3 as farmers in the country find that their traditional cannabis crop is no longer as profitable north of the border			1
@entity3 campesinos are turning away from growing marijuana after decriminalisation of the drug in many @entity15 states has led to steep falls in its wholesale price			1
instead they are filling their fields with opium poppies , a crop more commonly associated with @entity23 , which offers them a far greater return on their efforts			0
@entity43 , 50 , a lifelong marijuana farmer from @entity3 's @entity46 state , told the @entity47 that growing the pungent - smelling herb was simply ' not worth it any more			1
' ' i wish the @entity1 would stop with this legalisation , ' he said			1
for decades a scourge of the back alleys of @entity15 life , heroin is once again spreading across the country			2
the death of the @entity59 - winning actor @entity58 in february only underscored a problem many @entity15 communities were already facing , the rising use of - and deaths from - heroin			2
once mainly a city phenomenon , the drug has spread - gripping postcard villages in @entity68 , middle - class enclaves outside @entity70 and other places			2
cocaine , painkillers and tranquillizers are all used more than heroin , and the latest federal overdose statistics show that in 2010 the vast majority of drug overdose deaths involved pharmaceuticals , with heroin accounting for less than 10 per cent			1
a @entity3 peasant harvests opium paste from a poppy : the plummeting price of the heroin is down to a huge hike in production in @entity3 , now @entity1 's biggest source of the drug , says the @entity89 but heroin 's escalation is troubling			1
last month , @entity1 attorney general @entity92 called the 45 per cent increase in heroin overdose deaths between 2006 and 2010 an ' urgent and growing public health crisis			1
' in 2007 , there were an estimated 373,000 heroin users in the @entity1 by 2012 , the number was 669,000 , with the greatest increases among those 18 to 25			1
first - time users nearly doubled in a six - year period ending in 2012 , from 90,000 to 156,000			1
experts claim that many users turned to heroin after a crackdown made prescription drug painkillers such as @entity42 harder to find and more costly			1
it can kill when the drug is extremely pure or laced with other powerful narcotics			2
that , coupled with a low tolerance once people start using again after treatment , is catching addicts off guard			0
in the @entity118 area , heroin - related overdoses killed 195 people last year , shattering the previous record			1
some @entity122 police chiefs say heroin is easier for kids to get than beer			0
in @entity68 , the governor devoted his entire @entity128 speech this year to heroin , which threatens to overwhelm courts with related crime			2
and this month , @entity133 ' governor declared a public health emergency over heroin and opiate abuse , directing that first responders be equipped with an overdose antidote			0
on the rise : a drug addict prepares a needle to inject himself with heroin in the @entity144 area of @entity145 overall , use of the drug is believed to have increased 79 per cent between 2007 and 2012 , according to federal data cited by the @entity47			1
it claims that high - grade heroin is available across rural @entity1 for as little as $ 4 a hit , well undercutting the cost of prescription drugs that have long been the drug of choice in such areas			1
that plummeting price , according to the @entity89 , is down to a huge hike in heroin production in @entity3 , now @entity1 's biggest source of the drug			1
@entity1 officials seized a record 2,162kg of heroin along the @entity3 border last year , up from a mere 367kg in 2007			1
much of that is grown in @entity167 , a state which has for decades been a giant drug farm and whose home - grown @entity169 is now believed to control as much as half of the @entity15 heroin market			2
a drug addict injects three bags of quality heroin , one after the other in @entity70 , @entity178 : overall , use of the drug in the use is believed to have increased 79 per cent between 2007 and 2012 , according to federal data the surge in heroin hitting the @entity1 market has been blamed at least partly on the fall in the profits available from the wholesale production of cannabis			1
with new liberal legal regimes in 20 @entity1 states and the @entity191 more of domestic demand is being filled with strong , hydroponic varieties grown in converted warehouses			2
that has led to a collapse in the price @entity3 growers can charge for their marijuana crops , falling from $ 100 a kilo to less than $ 25 in the past five years			1
police in @entity202 have arrested a woman after she called them to complain about the quality of the marijuana she had bought from a dealer			0
@entity210 police sergeant @entity208 said yesterday that an officer went to the home of 37 - year - old @entity213 , above right , to hear her complaint that the dealer refused to return her money after she objected that the drug was substandard			2
@entity219 says she pulled the small amount of marijuana from her bra when the officer asked if she still had it			0
she was arrested friday on a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia			0
@entity228 said monday that she spent $ 40 on ' seeds and residue			0
' she says she called police when she got no satisfaction from the dealer 's family			0
@entity3 researcher @entity235 , of the @entity236 , told the @entity47 that this collapse in price was leading @entity3 's traditional marijuana farmers to diversify			2
' the wave of opium poppies we ’re seeing is at least partially driven by changes we ’re making in marijuana drug policy , ' he added			0
the going rate for a kilogram of raw opium sap in the @entity248 is $ 1,500 - nearly double its 2012 price - growers told the @entity47			2
farmers can produce nearly eight kilos of that sap per acre , given favourable weather , enough for a kilo of heroin that can reach a wholesale price in the @entity1 of a staggering $ 80,000			1
but what 's good for the farmers is proving catastrophic for addicts in the @entity1 on a beautiful sunday last october , detective @entity259 stood in a suburban @entity261 home and looked down at a lifeless 20 - year - old - a needle mark in the man 's arm , a syringe in his pocket			1
fresh out of treatment , this man was @entity259 ' second heroin overdose that day			0
' you just drive away and go , ' well , here we go again , '' the veteran cop told the @entity273			0
in @entity275 , @entity122 , responding to heroin overdose calls is so common that the @entity277 coordinator likens it to ' coming in and eating breakfast - you just kind of expect it to occur			0
' a local rehab facility has a six - month wait			0
one school recently referred an 11 - year - old boy			0
' there are so many residual effects , ' the sheriff there says			0
' and we 're all paying for it			0
' even for those growing it , like @entity43 , the new crop is fraught with danger			0
blooming radiant purple , red and white , the poppies are easily spotted from the air			0
