click here for all the stats , facts , line - ups and heat maps from @entity5 it was what @entity8 hopes will become the old one - two			1
@entity10 set it up , @entity9 tucked it away			1
from the penalty spot , admittedly — but they all count			1
certainly when a team has as much catching up to do as @entity16			1
there is no point wallowing in the torpor that currently surrounds the national team , that backdrop of sighs and shrugs and whatevs that has haunted the group since @entity26			0
yes , the new @entity28 qualification process is boring			0
yes , @entity8 ’s @entity16 team have been largely uninspiring			1
no , it wo n’t get any better in the next two seasons , until @entity16 meet strong opposition at the finals in @entity34			2
we just have to be make the best of it until then			0
we need to make the fans believe again never in doubt : @entity16 captain @entity9 smashes home a penalty to give @entity16 the lead midway through the second half at @entity5 all smiles : @entity9 is congratulated after scoring the winner for @entity16 in their first match since returning from the @entity50 @entity16 : @entity51 6 , @entity52 6.5 ( @entity53 81 ) , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6.5 ( @entity56 84 ) , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 69 , 6 ) , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6.5 ( @entity62 69 , 6 ) , @entity10 7.5 , @entity9 6.5 ( @entity63 70 , 6 ) , @entity64 6.5 ( @entity65 89 )			1

referee : @entity95 ( @entity96 )			0
ratings by @entity98 and while this was n’t the best by any stretch of the imagination , there were glimpses , tiny reminders that , let off the leash , @entity16 do have some players worth watching			2
chief among them , without doubt , is @entity10 , who was the best player on the night , and could be among the finest in @entity111 one day			2
that his attacking verve created the goal for @entity9 was no more than he deserved			2
did @entity9 deserve it ? this was n’t his greatest game , it must be said			1
yet it was the game of a new captain itching to lead from the front and there was never any question over who would take the penalty			1
the skipper assumed the responsibility with relish and delivered what proved to be the winning goal in much the same fashion			0
this was hardly a fresh beginning but , in the circumstances , how could it be ? @entity5 was half - empty , if that , and @entity39 were uninspiring yet grimly cussed opponents — hard in the tackle and defending in deep banks as if a point was needed to qualify for a tournament of significance			1
equally , this is an @entity16 manager and team still recovering from their earliest @entity50 exit in half a century			2
the defence looks vulnerable to pressure and at times @entity16 ’s build - up is ponderous			1
several players often fail to replicate their club performances , and chances are frequently wasted			0
@entity9 ’s penalty was @entity16 ’s first shot on target , and it came after 68 minutes			1
reasons to be cheerful ? they invariably start , as expected , with @entity10			2
he is already among the most promising teenagers in @entity111 and if @entity8 can harness his @entity160 form , @entity16 have a genuine match - winner			1
@entity63 came on and forced the best save of the night from @entity39 goalkeeper @entity71 and @entity64 had a couple of near misses in the first half			0
but it is fair to say that most that was good about @entity16 came through @entity10 , and any breakthrough was likely to come from him			1
new era : @entity16 captain @entity9 leads out the @entity16 team in their first match after the @entity50 sparse : the teams line up before kick - off with a sea of empty seats in the background , especially in the upper tier scene : only a handful of tickets had been sold for the upper tier at @entity5 in the 90,000 - seat stadium as it eventually did			1
already the star of @entity16 ’s show , it was @entity10 ’s determined running , in the face of some very close attention , that turned what would have been one very damp squib into a happier affair			1
there was n’t much on when @entity10 committed @entity72 on the left side of the penalty area , but he did enough to worry his man into diving in with an ill - judged and clumsy outstretched leg			1
@entity10 was brought to the floor , referee @entity95 pointed to the spot and @entity9 collected the ball greedily			1
he knew this was his chance to change the narrative			0
there are some who would not have @entity16 ’s captain in the starting line - up , but the way he simply leathered the ball into the top left corner of the goal was an emphatic statement			1
damn the low - key surrounds , damn the low - key occasion			0
@entity9 had talked of this as his moment and here he demonstrated a truly desperate desire to take it			2
@entity60 produced another typically energetic performance , as his heat map ( below ) shows - click here for our brilliant match zone package sliding in : @entity16 left back @entity57 in challenged by @entity39 's @entity223 during the international friendly instruction : @entity16 manager @entity8 has a word with @entity58 during a break in play during the first half he was substituted two minutes later , no doubt to protect him for the bigger match in @entity232 on monday			1
did he have a great game ? not really			0
did he catch the eye ? hardly			0
was @entity63 more of a handful in his brief substitute appearance ? yes			0
will @entity9 play against @entity237 ? definitely			2
@entity8 will recall one of @entity9 ’s previous visits there , under @entity241			1
it was among his finest games for @entity16 in recent years			2
if this rekindles those memories and sends him to @entity237 in a positive frame of mind , @entity8 will settle for that			2
yet it is @entity10 , not @entity9 , who the @entity250 will be eyeing after this			1
@entity16 do not have so many world beaters that he does not stand out			2
on the move : @entity160 striker @entity64 attempts to take on the @entity39 defence during the first half at @entity5 challenge : @entity257 midfielder @entity61 is brought down by former @entity258 player @entity73 threat : @entity160 's teenage star @entity10 runs at the @entity261 defence in an attempt to break the deadlock other good news about this @entity16 era ? certainly , journey times to @entity5 have improved			1
with just over 40,000 inside , the @entity267 at rush hour no longer resembles , well , the @entity267 at rush hour			0
it takes no time to get here now , and you can probably get parked , too , considering many of the people in the stadium are not allowed to take holidays out of term time , let alone drive a car			0
there is also greater connection with the players , the fans now able to hear many of their cries on the pitch			0
@entity8 gave forceful instructions to his defence , @entity57 shouted in pain after a late tackle			2
@entity61 ’s conversation with referee @entity95 after he had been denied a blatant penalty following a foul by @entity73 is probably best left unrecorded , though			0
it was n’t the worst @entity16 performance , but it was not much to get excited about and the anaemic atmosphere was a burden			1
we are used , even in difficult times , to decent crowds at the rebuilt @entity5			2
seeing it like this , the top tier all but closed , @entity5 even emptier than usual , the lower tier full but strangely unmoved , gave the whole event an empty , unsatisfying air			0
turning point : @entity10 was brought down by @entity72 midway through the second half to win @entity16 a penalty power and placement : captain @entity9 smashed home the penalty past @entity39 goalkeeper @entity71 in the 68th minute @entity314 looks to spearhead @entity16 revival looking up : the @entity317 striker looks to the heavens after scoring from the penalty spot at @entity5 done for the day : @entity9 leaves the field with 20 minutes to play and is replaced by @entity63 - who joined @entity257 for £ 16m on transfer deadline day well played , captain : @entity9 shakes hands with manager @entity8 after being substituted at @entity5 for the television viewer there would have been considerably more tension during the @entity328 on @entity329 , certainly if somebody ’s ice cream got left on the formica top by mistake again			1
@entity39 were not tame opponents , they were certainly well organised , but @entity237 will have a lot more about them going forward , particularly at home			0
nevertheless , @entity51 was forced into a superb save from @entity84 after 50 minutes and was almost caught out when @entity77 struck a cross from the right in the first half			0
@entity51 scrambled back a couple of steps , but failed to take the ball cleanly , only gathering it at the second attempt			0
it would have been a thoroughly depressing moment had that gone in , and a defeat in @entity232 could still turn apathy into mutiny back home			0
@entity16 had the best chances of the first half , mostly created by @entity10 who put in @entity352 twice , plus @entity57 , without success			1
it was , in essence , a repeat of the issues at the @entity50 ; @entity16 had the possession and the opportunities but lacked the touch of class required to convert them			0
it is a long road back from here , and not much scenery either .			0

@entity9 scored from penalty spot in 68th minute at @entity5
@entity16 captain converted after @entity160 star @entity10 was fouled in the penalty area
just 40,181 fans attended the game - the lowest attendance for an @entity16 match at @entity5 since it *reopened*
@entity10 *awarded* man of the match after *impressive* performance for @entity8 's side
