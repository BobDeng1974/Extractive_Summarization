by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 14 october 2013 the trend for foreigners to have libel disputes settled in @entity4 could soon be a thing of the past following a landmark @entity7 decision			1
@entity4 is a popular destination for so - called libel tourism because complainants believe they have more chance of winning a case in our legal system			1
but yesterday , two libel cases involving allegations of corruption and crime in @entity20 were thrown out by judges because they were deemed to have little connection to @entity4			1
no defamation : judges ruled that @entity25 , pictured , could not have defamed a former @entity27 policeman accused of fraud because he had no established reputation in @entity4 the decisions were hailed as a victory against libel tourism , which has become an embarrassment to @entity4 after a number of @entity36 states introduced laws enabling their courts to refuse to enforce defamation judgements handed down here			1
one of the two cases was brought by a former @entity27 policeman against @entity42 fund chief @entity25 , chief executive of @entity43 , who said he had covered up a £ 150million fraud by causing the torture and murder of a prisoner			0
but mr justice @entity48 said that the policeman , @entity49 , had no established reputation in @entity4 and so could not have suffered harm from the allegations			2
‘ the connection with this country is limited to the presence of some of the parties and it being the place where some of the defamatory material was , and continues to be , published , ’ he said			0
justice : libel tourism become an embarrassment to @entity4 after a number of @entity36 states introduced laws enabling their courts to refuse to enforce defamation judgements handed down here the judge said that there had been denunciations of the murder in @entity36 and @entity20 , but in @entity71 the official view was there was no reason for an international response to a fraud against the @entity71 state and the death of a @entity71 citizen			1
the second case was brought by a @entity81 tobacco baron , @entity82 , who was accused by banker @entity84 of murder , drug smuggling and altering his appearance with plastic surgery			0
only one copy of the newspaper which carried the allegations , @entity90 , found in @entity4			2
mr @entity92 said @entity82 had suffered no damage in @entity94 and @entity95 and that even though there had been ‘ minimal ’ internet publication , the case was not ‘ worth the candle ’			0
media lawyer @entity100 , part of the legal team that successfully saw the @entity71 case thrown out , said it was ‘ a truly landmark judgment ’			0
‘ @entity106 , brigands and oligarchs will be discouraged from the abuse of @entity4 courts , ’ he said			2
in @entity112 politicians agreed they needed a law to ‘ pressure foreign jurisdictions like @entity4 to change its laws to place greater protections on free speech ’ , after @entity36 writer @entity118 was held to have libelled @entity120 businessman sheikh @entity119 in her book on the financing of terrorism in 2003			1
the book was not published in @entity4 , but mr @entity125 ordered her to pay damages of £ 30,000 because 23 copies had been distributed in this country over the internet .			0

foreigners come to @entity4 to settle libel disputes because they believe they have a better chance of winning under @entity4 law
the practice has become an embarrassment to @entity4 after a number of @entity36 states introduced laws enabling their courts to refuse to enforce defamation judgements handed down here
