you may not have noticed how tricky it is to snap a single strand of dried spaghetti in half , but the phenomenon has baffled leading physicists for decades - including a @entity8 winner			1
but now one engineer has filmed spaghetti fracturing at 250,000 frames per second ( fps ) to explain why this happens			1
the @entity14 star found that vibrations do not cause the spaghetti to shatter - as previously suggested			1
instead , as it tries to ‘ straighten itself out , ’ the pasta forms cascading fractures and rapidly breaks into multiple pieces as its bent			2
it seems that the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting of the pasta this theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent			1
if the hands are moved closer together on the strand , the outcome can differ			0
on his @entity14 channel , @entity46 , @entity45 set out to explore why a single strand of spaghetti does n’t break in half , but instead shatters into at least three pieces when bent from the tips			1
generally , rods - such as a pencil - eventually break into two if they are bent			0
this happens when the top of the rod exceeds the maximum allowable tensile stress , which is the state of stress that leads to expansion			0
when a piece of spaghetti was bent to breaking point , and the process was filmed at 250,000 frames per second , it was revealed that smaller broken pieces of pasta rotate away from the first fracture , and the ‘ back ’ of a piece of spaghetti moves ' downwards '			1
engineer @entity45 explained that the spaghetti strand is trying to straighten itself out , because it twists when it is bent into a curve			1
when a first break occurs , the piece that breaks off from the main strand untwists , but the remaining longer section is more twisted than before , triggering one or more fractures - causing it to break into more than three pieces			2
‘ with every break , the process starts once again , which is called a cascading fracture , ' he explained			0
so the fracturing is like a chain reaction of destructive un-twisting this theory applies to a single strand of spaghetti that is held at each end before being bent			2
if the hands are moved closer together on the strand , the outcome can differ			0
but spaghetti ’s unusual shattering process has stumped scientists for years , including @entity8 winning physicist @entity101 , who worked on the @entity102			0
if you snap a strand of spaghetti , you feel a tiny vibration on your finger as it curves , leading dr @entity101 to suggest the vibration may ' excite ' the spaghetti enough to cause a secondary fracture			1
this means that he thought an elevation in energy levels at a molecular or atomic level was to blame			0
but , upon testing this theory under water to dampen the vibration , the spaghetti still broke in the same way - discounting this theory			0
since his efforts , some physicists and mathematicians have worked to solve the mystery			0
in 2006 , two physicists from the @entity126 and @entity127 in @entity128 , won the @entity129 for their work in explaining spaghetti shattering			2
they applied a mathematical calculation called the @entity134 equation , which explains how waves travel through an object that 's under stress			0
the physicists found that that spaghetti fragmentation is caused by ' flexural waves ' ( bending waves ) traveling through the pasta after the first break			1
this causes a wave to travel down the remaining strand of spaghetti before it can relax and un-twist			2
mr @entity45 began filming pasta snapping at 18,000 fps using a high - speed camera to test the theory , but at this speed , both fractures seemed to happen simultaneously within a millisecond , giving him few clues			1
@entity45 ( in the video ) noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture , and the ‘ back ’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally , appears to break downwards , after he flexed a strand to break it at 40,000 fps - 10 times faster than previous research - it was possible to see which fracture occurred first in a ‘ snap , ’ leading him to say : ‘ it appears that the longer rods are n’t vibrating on the same timescale			1
' he noticed that the smaller broken pieces of pasta seem to rotate away from the first fracture , and the ‘ back ’ of a piece of spaghetti held horizontally , appears to break downwards			1
' it 's almost as if the spaghetti is trying to straighten itself out but it ca n't overcome its own mass , ’ he explained in the video			0
he found that a strand of spaghetti twists as it is bent , making it bend into a deep curve			0
‘ when a break occurs , the piece near the side near the break is free from torque , ’ mr @entity45 said , which means , it is no longer twisted			1
‘ it starts to straighten itself out from left to right , rotating up and straightening out along the way			0
’ in the video , the longer piece of spaghetti which is yet to break , is still curved and twisted and at the point that the first fracture occurred , the spaghetti is even more curved than it was before , causing another fracture almost immediately			2
‘ with every break , the process starts once again , which is called a cascading fracture , ’ he said			0
so the fracturing is similar to a chain reaction of destructive untwisting , which leaves the spaghetti broken into pieces instead of snapping in two			1
his video confirms the work by the physicists at @entity127 .			2

@entity45 filmed spaghetti snapping at 250,000 frames per second
he noticed broken pieces of pasta rotate away from the first fracture
engineer confirms fracturing occurs because the pasta is trying to un-twist
leading physicists have previously been baffled by the phenomenon
