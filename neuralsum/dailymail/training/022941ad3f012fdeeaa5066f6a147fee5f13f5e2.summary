by @entity1 reporter published : 22:45 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 08:10 est , 8 october 2012 the plot of the new film ' @entity4 ' , in which a @entity6 operative poses as a @entity8 bigwig scouting locations in @entity10 during political upheaval and secretly rescues six hostages , is almost as unbelievable as the true story behind the silver screen adaptation			1
but @entity6 master of disguise @entity16 is real , as are the six @entity18 saved in the daring rescue mission in 1979 during the @entity21 hostage crisis			1
for almost three months , the group hid out in @entity21 , sheltered by the @entity24 government until mr @entity16 flew in with fake business cards and a ridiculous cover story - and the @entity21 revolutionaries believed every word			1
. if it were n't true , it would be terrible , ' director @entity30 said			0
but a small group of six diplomats miraculously made it outside of the embassy and into the residence of the @entity24 ambassador @entity51 , where they stayed for 79 days until their rescue			0
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 and @entity59 and @entity60 effectively did n't exist - the militants did n't know they were missing hostages and the @entity18 could n't give away their position			1
' it was like robbing banks , except in our case , we had to make it look like the money was still there , ' mr @entity16 said to @entity70			1
as cover , mr @entity16 concocted an elaborate back story involving a @entity8 film called ' @entity4 '			1
' when you 're doing an ex-filtration of a group of people you need a cover story ... a lie , ' he said			2
' maybe it 's not credible but it 's so strange that it could n't be false - it had to be true			2
' mr @entity16 developed a plan to disguise the @entity18 as a @entity8 group scouting locations for the fake film			1
he said the team chose the name ' @entity4 ' based on an obscene knock , knock joke			2
he said the joke goes as follows : ' knock , knock ' , ' who 's there ? ' , ' @entity4 ' , ' @entity4 who ? ' , ' arr ... go ... f * * * yourself			2
' ' " @entity4 " was kind of a battle cry we used when things were going a little dicey , ' mr @entity16 said			1
taken captive : 52 @entity18 were held captive in the @entity102 in @entity10 in 1979 , but six managed to escape to the @entity24 ambassador 's home , where they awaited rescue danger : a mass of @entity21 protestors is held back from the gates of the @entity111 in @entity10 , nov. 5 , 1979			1
@entity21 students stormed the embassy the day before , taking scores of @entity18 and other nationals as hostages crisis : two lines of troops loyal to @entity120 stand in front of the @entity18 embassy during shooting in the compound , feb. 15 , 1979 in @entity10 as part of the plot , he obtained a script , advertised the film , printed business cards , and rented and staffed a @entity8 office in case anyone in @entity21 checked up on the story			1
' we decided to call it " @entity137 " productions because there was six of these guys and gals , ' he remembered			0
then , posing as the film 's producer , he slipped into @entity10 and began prepping the hostages for their big roles			1
as time went on , the situation became more and more dangerous , he said			0
' the @entity24 ambassador was getting anonymous phone calls with people asking for them by name , ' mr @entity16 said			2
' my chore was to get in and get everyone to believe in the first meeting that we were going to be able to do this			0
' with a back story for each and every hostage , mr @entity16 helped transform the embassy workers into @entity8 types and handed them fake @entity24 passports and whisked them to the airport			1
life imitates art : left , @entity30 's upcoming movie poster and right , the imaginary film 's poster plan : as part of the plot , mr @entity16 obtained a script , advertised the film , printed business cards , and rented and staffed a @entity8 office in case anyone in @entity21 checked up on the story disguise : with a back story for each and every hostage , mr @entity16 helped transform the embassy workers into @entity8 types and handed them fake @entity24 passports and whisked them to the airport			1
@entity56 , pictured , became @entity186 mr @entity56 remembers how terrified he was when they got to the heavily guarded airport			0
' our hats were @entity24 , our shirts were @entity24 , all of the paraphernalia that comes along with life had that @entity24 mark if someone decided to pull us aside and go through luggage , ' he said to @entity70			0
' i ended up going through clearance first and was questioned			0
' he said they first asked him if he was the person in his photograph , to which he responded ' yes			0
' then , he said , the guard left him and his compatriots in line and went into a side room			0
a few minutes later he returned - with a cup of tea			2
safely through the security check , the group waited patiently for their flight , which was delayed , before they successfully escaped on january 27 , 1980			0
the @entity24 embassy was closed on the same day and all of the people who aided the @entity18 were flown safely out of the country			0
the other 52 hostages were released on january 20 , 1981 , after several attempt to negotiatetheir release and a failed rescue mission , with the signing of the @entity223 in @entity224 on january 19 , 1981 minutes after @entity225 was sworn into office			0
once home , mr @entity56 gave @entity137 a ring			0
safe : safely through the security check , the group waited patiently for their flight , which was delayed , before they successfully escaped on january 27 , 1980 together : @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and director / actor @entity30 attend the ' @entity4 ' @entity236 at @entity238 @entity237 on october 4 , 2012 in @entity239 , @entity240 ' i called the phone number on my business card			1
i asked to speak to myself			0
they said " he 's traveling in the @entity245 , ' mr @entity56 said			0
' and i said , " no " , i said " he 's home " ' for years , @entity24 was credited as the organizers of the ingenious plot , the @entity6 getting no credit for the operation			1
it was even known as the ' @entity251			0
' that changed in 1997 , the 50th anniversary of the @entity6			2
mr @entity16 was honored by the agency that year , and the story behind @entity4 was declassified			1
wired magazine covered the story in 2007 and in an ironic twist , director @entity30 optioned it for a real movie			1
' the fact that it 's based on true events means that you have to sort of take it seriously , ' he said to @entity70			0
he stars in it as mr @entity16 and @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity268 star alongside him .			2
