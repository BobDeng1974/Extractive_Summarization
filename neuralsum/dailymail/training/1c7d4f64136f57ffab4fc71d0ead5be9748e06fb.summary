is this @entity1 's oldest pcso ? officer @entity2 turned 70 yesterday but is n't going anywhere when most people hit 70 , they prefer to leave their working days behind and enjoy their golden years			1
but retirement can wait for one former @entity10 man who refuses to quit his job as a police community support officer			2
ex-boxer @entity13 celebrated the milestone yesterday and could be @entity1 's oldest frontline officer , but he aims to be catching criminals for many more years to come			1
officer @entity18 , who lives in @entity19 , @entity20 , joined @entity21 in 2007 after been reassured by his wife that community policing would “ suit you down to the ground "			1
in a career spanning 54 years , the granddad - of - four has proved he can turn his hand to almost anything			1
he joined the @entity10 aged 17 where his role with the @entity31 saw him perform ' shore patrols ' to keep hundreds of sailors in check as they roamed ports in @entity36 and @entity37			2
he also worked at @entity38 , as a golf course manager and even as a grave digger			1
but now , his only concession is to cut down to part - time hours due to his age			2
' working part - time was a 70th birthday present to myself , ' he said			2
' age is no barrier to a fulfilling career later in life			1
' i 'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb @entity54			0
' we 've got our eye on a place by the sea up there but it 's a little while off yet			0
' @entity65 , a retired carer , who has been married to @entity13 for 12 years , said : ' i told him he should get into community policing because i thought it would suit him down to the ground			2
' louis likes that sort of structure and keeping active so i said why do n't you give it a go ? age is no barrier : ' i 'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb @entity54 ' @entity89 joined the @entity10 aged 17 but his first application was rejected on height grounds			1
a year later , having grown half an inch , he was accepted @entity13 joined the @entity10 aged 17			1
pictured here in 1961 , he is training to shoot 303 rifles @entity13 ( pictured centre ) in the @entity10 leading hand taken in 1967 aboard @entity96 hobbies : left , the keen mountaineer climbing @entity99 in 1990 and right , at @entity100 ' and he 's not looked back since			1
' i think he 'll just keep going as long as he can because he really seems to enjoy it			0
' he 's not told me when he 'll stop so might have to put those plans in @entity67 on hold for now			0
' @entity89 added : ' @entity105 has been my office for the last seven years and i love the role			0
' it 's great being out and about , helping the public and working with retailers to tackle shoplifters			0
' there 's nothing more satisfying than helping lock up a pick - pocket			0
' it may have spared an elderly person the trauma of having their pension snatched or a teenager losing their new phone			0
' superintendent @entity123 said : ' louis is a shining example of how @entity54 can play an important role in our communities , building relationships with organisations and members of the public - people ask to speak to him personally , share their concerns and have confidence he ’ll act to address any issues			0
' it ’s great to hear him speak so passionately about the role and , when the day does come that he decides to hang up his uniform for the last time , he ’ll be sorely missed			0
