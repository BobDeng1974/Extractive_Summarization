by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:52 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 19 july 2013 a public inquiry into the poisoning of ex-kgb spy @entity5 was rejected because the government did not want to fall out with @entity7 , it emerged today			1
home secretary @entity8 said protecting ' international relations ' had played a part in the decision to reject the request to hold a full probe			1
coroner sir @entity14 had warned a public inquiry was needed because he could not consider vital secret evidence as part of a normal inquest			1
ex-russian spy @entity5 died in 2006 in @entity20 's @entity19 after being poisoned this was backed by mr @entity5 ’s widow @entity23 , who said she and her legal team were ‘ shocked and disappointed ’ by the government ’s refusal			1
but in a letter to sir @entity28 revealed part of the reason for turning down the request was the desire not to upset @entity7 president @entity34			2
mrs may wrote : ‘ it is true that international relations have been a factor in the government ’s decision - making			1
‘ an inquest managed and run by an independent coroner is more readily explainable to some of our foreign partners , and the integrity of the process more readily grasped , than an inquiry , established by the government , under a chairman appointed by the government , which has the power to see @entity40 material potentially relevant to their interests , in secret			2
‘ however this has not been a decisive factor and it if had stood alone would not have led the government to refuse an inquiry			0
’ home secretary @entity8 suggested @entity7 president @entity62 would not think a public inquiry was independent mrs may said that the government is anxious that mr @entity5 ’s death is properly investigated , and accepts that there are ‘ important factors ’ in favour of establishing an inquiry			1
she wrote : ‘ may i begin by assuring you that the government shares your concern to make certain that the tragic death of mr @entity5 is properly investigated			0
‘ like you , the government is anxious that as much as possible of the investigation is conducted in public , and in such a way that mr @entity5 ’s family are as closely involved in the process as is consistent with the public interest			2
’ @entity5 , the widow of @entity79 , has vowed to continue her fight for the truth mr @entity5 , 43 , was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 while drinking tea at the @entity84 in @entity20 ’s @entity85 in 2006			1
since his death his widow and son @entity87 have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing			0
mrs may told sir @entity14 the inquest will be able to address key concerns			1
‘ it is the view of the government that , despite the serious concerns you express , an inquest will go a substantial way to addressing or allaying public concern about this incident , ’ she said			0
‘ it will be able to use open material , for example , to explore the circumstances in which the polonium was brought into this country , to ascertain the likely movement of the polonium and those who were apparently carrying it around the country ; to expose the evidence about the events leading up to the murder			0
’ she said that an inquiry would take longer and cost more than a normal inquest , and that ministers could address any remaining concerns over mr @entity5 ’s death after legal proceedings had finished , possibly with an independent review			2
‘ the question whether or not public concern remains at the end of that process is a matter primarily for ministers and one best judged at the conclusion of the inquest			0
’ any secret evidence presented during a public inquiry would have to be held in closed session and would remain private , she said			0
‘ the result would be that an inquiry would reveal publicly only that which the inquest would reveal publicly			0
the persons perhaps most closely concerned with the investigation , namely @entity23 and @entity140 , would learn no more from an inquiry than they would from the inquest			0

@entity7 spy @entity5 was poisoned in @entity20 hotel in 2006
coroner sir @entity14 asked for public inquiry instead of an inquest
but @entity150 government rejected the idea to the dismay of ex-spy 's family
@entity8 admits ' international relations ' played a part in refusal
