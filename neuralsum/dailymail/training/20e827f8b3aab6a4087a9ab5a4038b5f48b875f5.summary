bully - which follows five teenagers and families who have been impacted by bullying - was originally given an r rating for language , meaning anyone under the age of 17 would not be able to see it			1
it became a heated issue between the @entity22 and studio @entity23 because the aim of the film is to show young people a closer look at the effects of bullying			1
' i 'm just glad that we held strong			0
i think this is a great resolution , ' @entity45 told @entity59 about his and distributor @entity23 's battle with the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) of @entity63 's ratings board			1
' we are getting so much interest to see the film , and this makes it much easier for schools to get behind it			0
' compromise : director @entity45 said he was able to keep a key scene in the film for which he lobbied hard , but he edited out three uses of one certain word to appease the group that rates movies based on language , sex , violence and other content tragic : @entity80 and @entity81 at the grave of their 17 - year - old son @entity83 , who hung himself after years of torment by his classmates			1

@entity23 marketing chief @entity102 said many church groups , school groups and youth organizations had been inquiring about the movie 's content , and he hoped that more of them now come to see the film			2
the @entity22 ranks movies to give audiences an idea of the content within any given film			1
their decision was based on the use of one certain curse word that is used six times in the movie - if it features more than once it automatically results in an ' r '			0
but @entity45 had argued that the language was a reflection of real life : ' it 's what the children who are victims of bullying face on most days			2
' @entity45 and @entity44 initially lobbied the @entity22 's ratings board to change its mind , arguing that it will exclude the very people on whom it would have the most impact - young people			2
but @entity45 refused to change his movie , and the @entity22 refused to budge , too			2
last weekend , it went out unrated , but even that distinction limits a movie 's play in some theaters and to some groups			0
a compromise was reached when @entity45 agreed to edit out three uses of the particular word , and the @entity22 agreed to allow one key scene in which one of the film 's subjects is beaten on a school bus and the word is used three times			1
' we retained the central scene and all three ( words ) are intact			0
the whole scene is intact and that ... was a great victory for me , ' @entity45 said			0
