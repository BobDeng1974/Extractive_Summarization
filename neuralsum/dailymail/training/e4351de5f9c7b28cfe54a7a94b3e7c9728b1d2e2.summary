@entity0 is to be hauled before mps to face questions over what she knew about a damaging letter leaked by her closest aide to undermine @entity6			1
the home secretary – who is seen as a @entity9 leadership contender – will be asked about her role in the ‘ unseemly ’ public feud with the @entity12 over how @entity14 extremism is tackled in schools			1
she will be asked about any personal involvement in the release of a letter she wrote to mr @entity6 raising concerns about his department ’s response to allegations of a plot by @entity26 hardliners in @entity27			1
@entity29 chairman @entity28 has called home secretary @entity0 to give evidence in @entity31 after the deeply damaging row led to the resignation of her close aide , @entity34 @entity28 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said he had written to mrs may to demand a full investigation into what had happened			1
he also revealed that her special adviser @entity34 , who was forced to resign on saturday night , could be called to give evidence			1
@entity45 ’s @entity44 yesterday stepped up pressure on the government by accusing the home secretary of breaching the ministerial code that sets out the standards of conduct for those in government			1
mr @entity54 is said to be ‘ deeply frustrated ’ over the row between two key @entity57 figures			1
there will be concerns in mrs may ’s camp that the questions over her conduct could harm her leadership ambitions , and she is known to be furious that she has lost miss @entity34 – one of her most loyal and trusted advisers			1
last night , @entity67 sources suggested that cabinet secretary sir @entity68 may have already concluded that mrs may did not know about the letter ’s publication because he only told mr @entity6 to apologise			1
the bitter row started late last tuesday when comments published in the @entity73 from an unnamed source – made by mr @entity6 during a lunch at the newspaper – criticised @entity79 counter-terrorism chief @entity78 ’s approach to preventing the spread of extremism			1
within hours of the story appearing , a letter mrs may previously sent to mr @entity6 questioning his department ’s response to the @entity14 ‘ trojan horse ’ allegations in @entity27 schools was placed on the @entity79 website by @entity89			1
this was a confidential item of @entity57 correspondence and should not have been released			1
a @entity79 aide also briefed against mr @entity6 to the @entity95 on wednesday morning			1
furious that wednesday ’s @entity96 had been overshadowed , @entity54 ordered sir @entity68 to carry out an inquiry			2
it led to @entity89 taking the blame for the letter and resigning on saturday night			1
mr @entity6 wrote to apologise to the prime minister and mr @entity78			1
it is unclear if he will also be forced to apologise to the @entity104			1
fired : home secretary @entity0 , left , was forced to fire her aide @entity34 , right , in the aftermath of a vicious row with @entity6 although the @entity12 will face a rough ride in the @entity110 today when he publishes 21 reports by @entity112 into the @entity27 schools affair , it is mrs may who is facing more questions over her conduct			1
mr @entity28 said : ‘ i have written to the home secretary for a full explanation of what has happened			1
the committee will question her about these matters			2
there is a strong case to hear from ms @entity34 herself as to why she has resigned			1
@entity54 will reshuffle his cabinet in the next ten days – and is expected to use the opportunity to promote women			2
employment minister @entity128 , who impressed the prime minister with her defence of benefit reforms , is among those being tipped for the top table			2
the @entity134 was a presenter on @entity95 and @entity136 before becoming an mp			2
she was also a successful businesswoman , setting up the firm making it @entity139 , which provides training for small businesses			2
however , she has a majority of just 2,436 in her constituency of @entity144			2
children ’s minister @entity145 and women ’s minister @entity146 could also be promoted			2
long - serving cabinet ministers who may have to make way for a female influx include @entity150 , the @entity151 , who could become @entity139 ’s next @entity153 commissioner			2
chief whip sir @entity154 and @entity155 – the veteran minister without portfolio – may also go			2
despite their public row over extremism in schools , both education secretary @entity6 and home secretary @entity0 are expected to keep their jobs			1
‘ this unseemly row obscures the pressing issue of how to combat radicalism in schools			1
‘ @entity0 must also ensure that in the future there are no potential conflicts of interests that may impact on her decision - making			1
’ miss @entity44 said mrs may needed to explain her actions , including whether she breached the ministerial code , which states that ministers should not leak confidential letters between members of the government			1
she told the @entity95 ’s @entity179 : ‘ we ’ve seen the education secretary apologise , the special adviser to the home secretary resign , but we ’ve heard nothing from the home secretary even though it looks clear that she has breached the ministerial code by writing and then authorising the publication of this letter			1
‘ the prime minister is responsible for enforcing the ministerial code			0
he needs to act and to make sure that that happens			0
@entity0 needs to come out publicly and answer what she did to publish this letter			1
’ @entity45 says miss @entity34 should not receive the substantial severance pay to which she may be entitled after losing her job			1
@entity195 , shadow cabinet office minister , said : ‘ if she has been awarded severance pay this would amount to £ 37,000 , which is the maximum possible and £ 10,000 above the average wage			0
this would be considered unacceptable in light of the circumstances of her departure			0
’ last night @entity205 was unable to say whether any payment had been made			0
pupils as young as six were taught to treat @entity210 women as ‘ white prostitutes ’ by a school at the centre of the ‘ @entity215 ’ @entity14 plot			1
the shocking disclosure comes ahead of two bombshell reports into claims @entity26 radicals conspired to infiltrate governing bodies of @entity27 schools			2
a leaked copy of one report says teachers at @entity225 told school inspectors they were alarmed by the use of terms such as ‘ white prostitute ’ and ‘ hellfire ’ in school assemblies , and that @entity233 teachers were banned from being present			2
a leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in @entity238 , @entity27 a report by the @entity240 says : ‘ we were told by teachers that non-muslim teaching staff are no longer allowed to take friday assemblies			0
in separate interviews , staff told us that in friday assemblies , occasionally words have been used such as “ white prostitute ” and “ hellfire ” which they felt were inappropriate for young children			0
’ well - placed sources have told @entity255 that the term ‘ white prostitute ’ was used to suggest to pupils that @entity26 women were moral but @entity233 women were not			0
@entity225 , which has around 600 pupils , is said to have been the subject of a gradual takeover by extremists , who allegedly pushed out head teacher , @entity265 , because she opposed the ‘ islamisation ’ of the school			0
head teacher @entity265 opposed the ' @entity267 ' of @entity238 officially , mrs @entity269 is on sick leave , and she refused to discuss the matter with @entity255			0
she was among four of the school ’s six senior managers who have left in recent months			0
it is also claimed that in one assembly , just before @entity276 last year , a senior teacher led ‘ an @entity279 ’ chant			0
he allegedly shouted at the pupils ‘ do we believe in @entity276 ? ’ , to which the pupils replied collectively ‘ no we do n’t			0
’ the senior teacher is said to have made other ‘ anti-christian comments ’ at the same assembly			0
officials from education watchdog @entity112 , who have also studied the ‘ @entity215 ’ claims , investigated the ‘ anti-christmas ’ chant incident , but found no evidence of it			1
however , a source said that teachers and pupils at @entity295 have referred to @entity296 as ‘ kaffirs ’ , a derogatory @entity299 term meaning infidels			0
the source said that as part of the @entity26 takeover , urinals from the boy ’s toilets were removed , in accordance with @entity26 custom which frowns on those who stand up to urinate			0
more than 95 per cent of @entity295 ’s pupils are @entity26			0
it holds @entity26 prayers every friday , teaches arabic and organises trips to @entity313			0
last week , @entity315 teacher , @entity314 defended the school , accusing @entity112 inspectors of ‘ having an agenda ’			0
he said he had seen no evidence of an extremist takeover , and denied @entity276 had been banned			2
in february , a senior @entity315 teacher is said to have posted a message on social media urging all muslims to disown those who gave up their faith			0
he said : ‘ do not love the one who does not love @entity327			0
if they can leave @entity327 , they will leave you			0
’ only a year ago , an @entity112 inspection of @entity315 found it ‘ outstanding ’ in all areas , including in promoting multi-racial harmony			0
it is one of 21 schools being probed for claims extremists tried to influence teaching			2
education secretary @entity6 is expected to put five schools into special measures when the reports are published tomorrow			1
he will make a @entity104 statement as head teachers hold a press conference in @entity27 to speak publicly for the first time			0
according to a leaked report , teachers at the school lead chants criticising @entity276 the five schools include @entity315 , and secondary schools @entity350 and @entity352			1
the running and teaching at all three have been described as ‘ inadequate			0
’ @entity112 inspectors criticise poor teaching at @entity352 , and in their report say : ‘ too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views			0
’ the school , which has just under 900 pupils , is said to have been taken over by extremists with an ‘ @entity365 agenda			0
’ former head teacher @entity366 reportedly left because he opposed the change			0
@entity112 say @entity352 did not provide adequate sex education and that some female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found ‘ intimidating ’			0
the school did little to ‘ mitigate against cultural isolation , ’ leaving students ‘ vulnerable to the risk of marginalisation from wider @entity139 society and the associated risks , which could include radicalisation ’			0
however @entity379 , chairman of governors at @entity352 , said he would challenge any move to put the school into special measures : ‘ @entity112 ’s views are completely unfounded , we do not practise isolationism or segregation			2
they did not check the reality on the ground			0
they were listening to comments @entity6 made			1
’ at @entity350 , it is alleged that pupils were told homosexuality is evil , given lists of @entity395 teachers and told to try to convert them and that staff preach ‘ mind - blowing ’ anti-western propaganda in assemblies .			0
