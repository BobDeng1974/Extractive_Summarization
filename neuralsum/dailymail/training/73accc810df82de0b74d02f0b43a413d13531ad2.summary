it is among the most delicate of operations , requiring fine precision from a steady hand			0
but for a team of cardiac surgeons in @entity6 , performing open heart surgery was made all the more complicated when their operating theatre was plunged into darkness			2
in the midst of the blackout the dedicated doctors refused to let their patient suffer , instead completing the life - saving operation by mobile phone light			1
illuminating their phones , the team held them above the patient 's open chest as torches allowing cardiac surgeon dr @entity22 , 45 , to carefully repair patient @entity24 's heart			1
dr @entity22 said halfway through the delicate operation the lights went out , following a government crackdown on electricity consumption			1
@entity6 relies predominately on hydropower but has been struggling to generate enough electricity due to low water levels in local rivers			0
dr @entity22 , head of the state - run heart clinic in the city of @entity54 , in central @entity6 , said : ' fortunately , the patient survived			1
' but these are the kind of extreme circumstances under which we perform operations on hearts that have stopped beating			0
' i am not sure if it is a crime or an act of heroism			0

' now locals have said they will come to the clinic 's aid , raising money to buy a generator to power the clinic in the event of future power cuts			2
shop owner @entity92 , 33 , said : ' dr @entity22 and his team saved the life of my friend 's mother			2
' what they do is so important i want everyone here to organise a collection so that if the electricity goes again , there will be enough light			0
