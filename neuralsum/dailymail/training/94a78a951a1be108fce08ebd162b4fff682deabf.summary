at the heart of @entity3 ’s defence , @entity0 played as if he owned the place			1
this was a performance of breathtaking maturity			0
to watch an @entity8 as composed as @entity9 on the ball , dropping off those extra 10 yards to be in possession or striding forward through midfield is something special			1
even with @entity16 breathing down his neck , he was always a step ahead of the game			0
the way he reads situations is remarkable for his age , showing far more composure in @entity3 ’s defence than his experienced team - mate @entity27			1
think of the great ball - playing @entity8 centre backs , from @entity48 to @entity49			0
this 19 - year - old has similar traits			1
this is a future @entity53 defender			2
last season he played right back but he was identified as a centre back as he came through @entity57 ’s academy			2
@entity19 , to his credit , will always be remembered as the manager who had the conviction to make the change			2
it is a good decision			0
@entity9 has already grown into the @entity3 shirt — enjoying life at the club and progressing at a remarkable pace			1
‘ @entity0 has come in and surprised everyone already , ’ said left back @entity67			0
‘ during the season we do n’t get to watch other players much , so i did n’t know too much about him			0
’ faith : @entity19 was more than willing to throw @entity9 into the team straight away trophy cabinet : @entity9 helped @entity3 to victory in the @entity77 last weekend he excelled in the @entity77 the previous weekend , part of an @entity3 team who beat the champions 3 - 0 on the grandest stage of all			1
soon enough , when @entity9 is called into the @entity53 squad , @entity85 will be his home on the international stage			1
on tuesday , he will be in @entity88 , playing in a @entity90 qualifier against @entity91 at the @entity92 in @entity93			1
on monday morning , when @entity3 train before they travel to @entity95 , @entity19 must decide whether to take @entity97 - winning defender per @entity98			1
although @entity98 has only just returned to training after a break following @entity102 ’s triumph , @entity19 is tempted to turn to experience against @entity105 ’s side			2
experience : @entity19 may prefer @entity108 @entity97 - winner @entity98 to @entity9 for tuesday night 's @entity90 play - off with @entity91 in @entity93 rest : @entity98 was given time off to recover after @entity102 won the @entity97 out in @entity111 this is a demanding week for @entity3 , who face a four - hour flight to @entity95 and will return in the small hours of wednesday morning in order to prepare for saturday ’s trip to @entity117			1
@entity3 were ordinary on saturday , but they were faced with unusual circumstances after palace manager @entity119 left the club 48 hours before the start of the season			2
it will take time for @entity125 to gel with his team - mates and he should be granted it			2
he was welcomed to the league with some fierce challenges from @entity25 captain @entity129 and his midfield partner @entity130			2
@entity3 are still bedding in , scrambling a result after they fell behind to a clever corner routine that ended when @entity133 flicked a header beyond @entity135			1
towering : @entity133 rises above the @entity3 defence to give @entity25 the lead on 35 minutes level terms : @entity27 got in behind the @entity25 defence to equalise for @entity3 on half - time @entity3 recovered when @entity27 equalised just before half - time and @entity30 struck @entity3 ’s winner			1
it was tough on @entity25 , but the priority is to find a manager before saturday ’s clash with @entity147 at @entity148			0
although chairman @entity150 is considering @entity151 and @entity152 for the role , he has been advised to hire a manager with some serious @entity23 experience			0
he held a mini board meeting with fellow directors before the game and they will explore a number of options this week			0
the timing of @entity119 ’s exit came as a shock to the players after a tough pre-season schedule in @entity166 , the @entity167 and @entity102			0
keeper @entity168 said : ‘ as professionals we need to deal with it and move on			0
@entity119 was very good for us and we learned a lot with him			0
we ’re sad to see him go this way , but the players have learned a lot from last season			0
‘ the education he gave us will make us stronger			0
’ manager search : @entity25 co-chairman @entity150 needs to find a replacement for @entity119 @entity179 lauds late @entity30 goal			1

new *signing* from @entity57 impressed on @entity23 debut for @entity3 as they beat @entity25 2 - 1
@entity9 showed composure in defence and *confidence* to stride forward
19 - year - old has *ability* to become a regular for @entity53 in coming years
@entity19 must decide whether to play @entity9 in @entity90 qualifier against @entity91 or restore per *mertesacker*
@entity25 took the lead through @entity133 's near post header
but @entity27 equalised shortly before half - time
@entity30 pounced in stoppage time to win all three points
