campaigners protesting about six blocks of student flats which are a ' horrible eyesore ' on a city skyline are urging authorities to slice off the top floors of the buildings at an estimated cost of £ 30million			1
protesters , including author @entity11 , have described the @entity13 development near @entity14 , @entity15 , as a ' terrible mistake ' and claim it blocks the view of the city 's famous spires			1
the flats , which are used as graduate housing by the @entity15 , have been marred by controversy since development began in 2012			1
the @entity13 development , which consists of student housing used by the @entity15 , has been marred in controversy since building began in 2012			1
campaigners claim it is a ' horrible eyesore ' on skyline after being built by @entity13 on behalf of the @entity15 , at a cost of £ 24million , the @entity33 group was set up to protest against their existence			1
over the last two years , it has campaigned against the development , claiming there were ' exceptionally low levels ' of public awareness of the initial planning application and criticising it for ' hampering ' the city 's skyline from the ancient meadow			1
the @entity13 development has not only received criticism for its location , but also for its design			0
former planning minister @entity49 mp previously described the buildings as ' some of the worst he had seen '			2
speaking in january last year , he said : ' i think that this design is possibly one of the worst designs i 've seen of any set of new buildings to go up in the last 10 years			1
' frankly , the only thing it reminds me of is the @entity59			0
' the development was also nominated for the @entity61 in 2013 , which is an annual award by @entity62 for ' the ugliest building in the @entity64 completed in the last 12 months			0
' in its nomination , the development was described as ' a deeply unimaginative and impoverished design which would lower the spirits whatever its setting , but on the edge of one of central @entity74 's most important and ancient landscapes , it is an outrage			2
' the saga surrounding the @entity13 development began in late 2011 when the @entity15 submitted the planning application to @entity78			1
as part of a consultation document for the development - which was built on a brownfield site near @entity15 railway station - planning consultants stated that it would ' not be visible from the majority of @entity14 '			1
over the last two years , the @entity33 campaign group has protested against the development , criticising the @entity15 for building on the ancient meadow			1
pictured : the meadow before the development @entity91 ( pictured ) , founder of the @entity33 campaign group , has welcomed the @entity15 's @entity93 meeting and supports the motion of reducing the height of the buildings to be in line with trees at the time , city council planning officers stated that the development was not in an environmentally - sensitive location and therefore no @entity102 ( @entity103 ) was required			1
development began in summer 2012 , and building work soon drew attention from residents and local business owners who were surprised at the height of the flat blocks			1
an online petition was drawn up to protest the height of the buildings and quickly gathered thousands of signatures			1
in march the following year , the @entity114 ( @entity115 ) issued a @entity117 challenge , challenging the council 's decision not to request an @entity102 as part of the planning process			2
it prompted the @entity15 to announce it would commission independent planning consultants to carry out a retrospective @entity102			1
the assessment was published towards the end of last year with three options : to change the appearance of the building externally , carry out height reduction on a couple of the buildings or reduce the height of all the buildings to the treeline of @entity14			1
the @entity15 has now confirmed that the institution 's ' @entity93 ' - its sovereign body , which consists of academic staff - will now vote on a formal motion to reduce the height of the blocks			1
the motion will be discussed on february 10 , and could be followed by a postal vote			0
@entity91 , founder of the @entity33 campaign group , has welcomed the @entity93 meeting and supports the motion of reducing the height of the buildings			1
protesters against the development include author and @entity15 graduate @entity11 , who wrote @entity149 he told @entity150 : ' normally in planning cases , you have up to three months after a planning application to lodge an appeal but in this case nobody really knew the application had been planted			2
' nobody was aware of the buildings until they started going up in september 2012 , by which time the three - month period for a legal challenge to the planning permission had long passed			2
' this was one of the many unusual things about the case so we started looking into it and what we uncovered was an extremely unsatisfactory planning process			0
' the costs of rectifying the building are very high			0
the @entity15 should have acted much earlier , when it realised a terrible mistake had been made and when it became obvious that almost everyone complained about the buildings - not just because of the impact but that they had no idea planning permission had been applied for			1
' mr @entity91 admitted that it would cause upheaval to students living in the building if work was carried out to reduce the height , but said this should have been thought about at the beginning of the planning process			2
he said : ' i do n't think the @entity15 is facing any easy options but what price do you put on its accountability to get things sorted			2
' i recognise that there are no easy choices now			0
the idea of spending the money on buildings that have already gone up is crazy and i can fully understand the view that there are other things the @entity15 could spend the money on			1
' but the trouble is that it all comes down to the fact that thousands of people have had their experiences of a natural heritage site ruined for the 40 - year lifetime of these buildings without them ever having had a say in it			2
' through their own incompetence the @entity15 managed to achieve this extraordinary outcome , this messy development that has had a huge impact			2
' i do n't think it was deliberate , i think it was incompetence			0
' the people making this decision on february 10 now have a proper moral decision			0
' they messed up royally and managed to have this extraordinary situation , and if they vote not to do it , then the public are the ones who suffer			0
' mr @entity11 , the author of @entity149 and a graduate of @entity15 's @entity229 , agreed that a top floor of each of the buildings should be removed			1
he told @entity233 : ' the @entity13 development is a horrible eyesore			1
we all understand the need for more housing , but the development was an abuse of the planning process			0
' i support the campaign to remove a floor			0
' the decision on whether the buildings will be reduced in height will be discussed on february 10 the @entity15 said in a statement that its focus throughout the development has been the best interests of its students and the city			1
a spokesman told @entity150 : ' we followed due planning process and built much - needed accommodation on a brownfield site on a former railway siding			0
' @entity13 has now been occupied for nearly a-year - and - a - half , home to more than 300 graduate students , some with young families			0
' at the same time we have relieved pressure on @entity64 's most un-affordable housing market			2
' independent experts have reported that @entity13 , with the mitigation measures we propose , delivers clear benefits to the city			0
' the resolution before @entity93 would undo these benefits			0
all 300 students would have to leave for at least a year and 38 flats , including family units , would be lost permanently			2
' there would be knock - on damage to the city 's hard - pressed property market			0
' the total cost of going down this route , according to independent experts , is £ 30million - more than the flats cost to build ( £ 24million )			0
' the proposal is strongly opposed by the @entity283 precisely because of the harm it would do			0
' @entity78 confirmed it had commissioned and published an independent report by planning expert , @entity287 , on the planning and environmental issues surrounding the development			0
a council spokesman told @entity150 : ' the @entity293 concluded that the planning permission was valid and that the necessary information was provided to the planning committee in taking its decision			0
' the report included a recommended action plan which has been accepted and implemented in full by the council			0
' the council spokesman also confirmed that the authority met the statutory requirements for consultation and said the @entity15 did undertake public consultation			2
however , he added : ' the council has accepted that there could have been greater consultation and has changed some of its procedural arrangements in line with the @entity293 recommendations on best practice			0
' he concluded that the council ' has not yet taken a view on the adequacy of the latest proposals			0
' the @entity15 's congregation will now meet to formally discuss the height reduction motion on february 10 .			1
