@entity0 is out of his rut , back in the @entity3 team , and the way he managed to relocate his missing spark may serve as a useful message for the entire national squad			1
the @entity9 scrum - half worked out that he was thinking too much , fretting too much , analysing and training and playing with tension			1
he decided to go back to basics ; to just play and not worry so much			0
the results have been encouraging , as he prepares to start against @entity14 on saturday			1
@entity0 has recovered from his loss of form and is set to start for @entity3 against @entity14 the scrum - half blames over analysing his game as part of the reason for losing his place @entity0 ( centre ) looks dejected following @entity3 's 31 - 28 defeat at the hands of @entity25 last week he said : ‘ last year , when i was n’t involved in the @entity27 , the biggest thing was to go back to my club and find that spark again ; find that thing that got me there in the first place , which was just playing rugby and enjoying it			1
' i was struggling for form and i did n’t know how to get out of that rut because i had n’t been in that situation before			2
i found myself training longer , kicking longer			2
i found myself passing longer , doing more weights — whatever it may be to find a way through			0
and in fact the best thing i could have done was to have done nothing			0
the @entity9 star ( centre ) has warned team - mates that everyone goes through a ' dark patch ' @entity3 are looking for a first autumn international win , having also been beaten by @entity51 ( above ) ‘ i ’m going to strip it right back to the minimum and focus on enjoying the performance on saturday			1
’ starting two tests on the tour of @entity51 in june helped revive @entity0 ’s self - belief , and he added : ‘ some guys have n’t been through a dark patch , but they will at some point because everyone does			2
‘ i think when you first come in and you ’re young , you ’re too naive to understand the pressures of it			0
i ’ve come full circle — back to realising what got me here in the first place			0
