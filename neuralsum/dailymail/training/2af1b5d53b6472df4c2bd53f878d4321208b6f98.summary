by @entity0 one in five adolescents has been knocked unconscious while playing sport at school - a figure that has shocked researchers			1
brain injuries measured in the research included cases where children had been unconscious for at least five minutes and those who had needed to be hospitalised over night			1
most previous studies have only recorded hospital cases of children 's brain injuries ; the addition of self - reported concussion which did not result in hospital treatment has now raised serious concerns in @entity18 , where the study was carried out			1
risk ? : large - scale @entity18 study find s that one in five teenagers has been knocked unconscious during sport at school in @entity18 , 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable young people involve a traumatic brain injury ( @entity28 )			1
brain injuries among adolescents are particularly concerning because their brains are still developing			2
there is growing evidence that people who have had one or more concussions are at greater risk of future concussions , and evidence that multiple brain injuries can result in lasting cognitive impairment , substance use , mental health and physical health harms			1
the large - scale @entity18 study found that teenagers who drank alcohol and smoked cannabis , and those who scored lower grades were more likely to suffer			1
researchers also found that boys were more susceptible than girls to get knocked out			0
sports such as ice hockey and football accounted for more than half the injuries , said dr @entity57 , lead author of the study and a post-doctoral fellow at @entity60 , in @entity61 , @entity62			2
the study , published in the @entity64 , was one of the first to focus only on adolescents and their self - reported traumatic brain injuries ( @entity68 )			1
concussion is the most common form of traumatic brain injury			0
the data used in the study were from the 2011 @entity62 student @entity75 and @entity74 ( @entity77 ) , developed by the @entity78			0
it is one of the longest ongoing school surveys in the world and contains responses from almost 9,000 students from grades seven to 12 in publicly funded schools across @entity62			2
teenagers most likely to get knocked out during sport were those who drank alcohol , smoked cannabis or achieved lower school grades the @entity77 began as a drug use survey , but is now a broader study of adolescent health and well - being			2
for the first time in 2011 , questions about traumatic brain injury were added to the survey			0
the survey found that 20 per cent of adolescents in @entity62 said they had had a traumatic brain injury in their lifetime			0
it found that 5.6 per cent of them had had such an injury in the past 12 months			0
dr @entity107 said this suggests the prevalence of @entity68 among young people is much higher than previously known , because many head injuries remain uncounted when they are not being reported to parents , teachers , sports coaches or health care workers			1
in @entity18 , 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable youth involve a @entity28			1
this new research found that 46.9 per cent of the @entity68 reported by adolescent females occurred during sports ( e.g. , hockey , skateboarding ) ; the figure was 63.5 per cent for males			0
students who reported drinking alcohol ' occasionally / frequently ' and those who reported using cannabis 10 or more times over the past 12 months had more than five times and more than three times the odds , respectively , of acquiring a traumatic brain injury in the past 12 months than students who reported abstinence			2
killer : in @entity18 , 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable young people involve a traumatic brain injury the survey also showed that students who reported overall poor grades at school ( below 60 per cent ) had almost four times the odds of a lifetime acquired brain injury than students who reported grades at or above 90 per cent			1
' traumatic brain injury is preventable , ' said dr @entity107			0
' if we know who is more vulnerable , when and how these injuries are occurring , we can talk to students , coaches , and parents about it			0
' we can take preventive action and find viable solutions to reduce their occurrence and long - term effects			0

first large - scale study to measure the number of students ' self - reported concussions at school , rather than just hospital - reported cases
high figure has shocked researchers because multiple brain injuries can lead to lasting cognitive impairment
in @entity18 , where study was carried out , 50 *%* of injuries that kill and disable young people are caused by brain trauma
