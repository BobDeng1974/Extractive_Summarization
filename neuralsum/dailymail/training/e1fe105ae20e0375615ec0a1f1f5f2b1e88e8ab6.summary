@entity0 face the potentially daunting task of needing to topple the mighty @entity2 in a bid to reach their first ever @entity5 quarter - final			1
the @entity7 champions will host @entity2 at the @entity8 on february 24 before a trip to the @entity10 three weeks later			2
@entity11 guides you through the mouthwatering second round clash			0
@entity14 and @entity15 do battle in the same fixture at the same stage last season will @entity0 be happy with their draw ? well , director of football @entity21 said immediately after the draw that @entity0 were ' very confident '			1
and who can blame them given the last couple of weeks ? ' we have plenty of confidence with the way we qualified beating @entity30 at home and @entity32 away , ' he said			0
' the players will be working hard to get fit and arrive in confidence for those games			0
have the two teams met before ? just a bit - this is exactly the same tie as last season 's second round			1
@entity0 were beaten 4 - 1 on aggregate , largely thanks to @entity42 horror performance at the @entity8			2
@entity44 's side were barely in it from the off			0
who do @entity0 have to watch out ? a certain @entity14 is said to be a dab hand in these @entity5 knockout games and is certain to cause even the very best all sorts of problems			1
@entity2 's @entity14 has proven a thorn in the side of a number of top clubs over the last decade whether @entity55 is able to arrest his slump since joining the @entity57 over the summer remains to be seen , and encouragingly for @entity0 , the @entity58 only scored once in four games against them while at @entity60			1
an awful lot rests on the shoulders of @entity15 , so the importance of @entity64 can not be underestimated ; he is the sort of defender who is capable of shackling the @entity68 in full flight			0
and what about the managers ? @entity72 is very much a novice at this level and that could be the sort of weakness @entity0 try and play on			0
@entity44 is one of the best tactical coaches in @entity79 and definitely has the upper hand over the young boss			0
@entity44 is one of the most tactically astute managers in @entity84 elite football what kind of draw is it for the fans ? supporters flying from @entity89 to @entity2 can get tickets for around Â£ 250 , so it 's not the cheapest option available from the draw			2
that coupled with the fact many will have been at last season 's second leg does n't make it as appealing as you 'd perhaps imagine			2
from the airport , hop on a train to @entity103 station and then take the green metro line to @entity105			0
what has it done for @entity0 's chances of winning the @entity5 ? no bookie seems to know what 's going to happen here - the odds of both sides winning the competition have actually lengthened			1
there were n't too many draws more favourable than this for @entity0 , particularly given @entity2 's indifference under @entity72 , although it was they who drifted the furthest afterwards .			1

@entity5 draw throws up @entity0 against @entity2
it is a *repeat* of last season 's second round tie , which @entity2 won
@entity15 , @entity127 , @entity14 and @entity55 to do battle
