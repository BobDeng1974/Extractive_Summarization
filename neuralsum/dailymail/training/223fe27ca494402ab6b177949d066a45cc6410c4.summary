@entity1 - trained @entity0 prevented a first blank for @entity3 at the @entity4 ’ @entity5 since 2007 when landing the $ 2million @entity6 at @entity7 in @entity8			1
but there was agony for @entity12 ’s toast of @entity13 , who was just touched by @entity15 when second in the $ 5million classic			1
the consolation for @entity19 ’s mount , who himself was just in front of @entity24 winner @entity22 in third , was prize money of over £ 500,000			2
jockey @entity28 rides @entity0 to victory it the @entity27 horse race at @entity7 for a few tense minutes after the race , it still seemed as if toast of @entity13 might still get the win as @entity33 - trained @entity15 and his jockey @entity34 had to survive a stewards ’ enquiry after jinking left at the stalls and hampering fourth - placed @entity39			1
but the result ultimately stood			2
meanwhile , the @entity41 - trained @entity0 , ridden by @entity28 , held off @entity43 - trained @entity42 with @entity46 ’s @entity45 third to win his race			2
@entity49 ’s @entity48 was sixth but there was disappointment for @entity54 - trained favourite @entity52			1
@entity28 celebrates after riding @entity55 to victory on his final run , the @entity58 winner drifted and faded into eighth of the 14 starters after racing prominently under a tactically aggressive ride from champion jockey @entity63			1
@entity0 , a 16 - 1 shot on account of his tough wide draw , had been beaten in two runs since his @entity1 guineas success , having had a poor draw in the @entity70 and a hampered run in the @entity72			1
@entity41 said : ‘ it ’s a great result			2
he was a brilliant two - year - old and was very good this spring			0
we gave him a break and he showed a great turn of foot today			0
’ @entity28 added : ‘ this is the biggest win of my career , to win a @entity5 race here in @entity82			0
the trainer did n’t give me any instructions			0
i just rode him like the quality horse he is			0
‘ i had a bad draw on the outside but got a good position			0
it is easier when you are on the best horse in the race and he gave me everything and quickened very well			0
