@entity2 ’s @entity1 even applies to the rate of climate change , new research shows			0
scientists have discovered that the climate in the @entity7 is warming much more quickly than that in the @entity9 of the country in summer			1
however , winter temperatures are increasing more quickly in the @entity9			1
the hottest five per cent of summer days in the @entity2 have become hotter since 1950			1
the greatest increases in temperatures have been in the @entity7			1
summer temperatures in the @entity9 have not risen as quickly the researchers also discovered that some of the hottest days and coldest nights in parts of @entity20 have warmed more than four times the global average since 1950			1
the new paper by researchers at the @entity24 and the @entity25 at the @entity26 , revealed that the hottest five per cent of days in summer have warmed fastest in a band from southern @entity28 and northern @entity29 to @entity30			1
in this band , the hottest five per cent of days have got hotter by more than 2 ° c in many places			1
by contrast , the average and slightly hotter than average days have warmed most in regions further south in @entity29 and @entity37			1
in eastern @entity39 and central @entity40 there has been broad warming across all types of days , but in most places those days which are cooler than average have not warmed so much			2
most regions of @entity20 have seen little change in the temperatures of the coolest summer days although in eastern @entity39 and central @entity40 these days have warmed along with all other types of summer days			1
image estimates changes in daytime summer temperatures that have occurred over a 43 year period			2
plot a shows the change in the five per cent of hottest summer days			1
plot c is the change in the average temperature			0
plot @entity61 shows the change in the five per cent of coolest summer days average temperature days in these regions of eastern @entity39 and central @entity40 have warmed by more than 2 ° c in many locations			1
the results show little warming in summer daytime temperatures for most locations in @entity69 and @entity70 , for all types of summer days – hot , average and cool			1
in @entity20 , the coldest five per cent of winter nights have warmed most in eastern @entity29 , western @entity37 and @entity74 where changes of more than two or even 2.5 ° c are not uncommon			1
the coldest five per cent of winter days have not changed as much in these regions but in northern @entity40 and the @entity79 changes of over 1.5 or 2 ° c are seen in the data			1
in @entity39 and much of @entity40 there has been little change in winter night time temperatures of all types – warm , average and cool			2
in @entity69 and @entity70 many regions have seen large changes in winter night time temperatures for average and colder than average nights			2
warmer than average nights in this region have warmed less			2
in the @entity2 the frequency of nights which fall below zero has decreased most substantially in the north east where reductions of at least 10 per cent are seen in the observations for some locations			1
the researchers translated observations of weather into observations of climate change using a gridded dataset of observations stretching back to 1950			0
the paper points out that some locations and temperature thresholds have seen little change since 1950			0
the authors suggest that the results highlight the scale of the difference between global change and the local climate changes felt by individuals			0
dr @entity117 , the lead author of the paper , said : ‘ climate is fundamentally the distributions of weather			0
‘ as climate changes , the distributions change			0
but they do n’t just shift , they change shape			0
‘ how they change shape depends on where you are			0
‘ in @entity2 , climate change will feel very different if you live in @entity130 to if you live in @entity131 - different again in @entity132			2
’ he added : ‘ our results also illustrate that the international goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to 2 ° c would involve far greater changes for some places and for some aspects of climate , and therefore for particular individuals , communities and industries			1
’ professor @entity146 of the @entity24 said : ‘ it is common to discuss climate change in terms of changes in global average temperatures but these can be far from people ’s perceptions of climate change			2
image estimates changes in night - time winter temperatures over a 43 year period			2
in the @entity2 , the largest changes can be seen in @entity61 which shows the very coldest five per cent of winter days			0
these have warmed by more than 1.5 degrees , with these changes focused mainly in the @entity164 ‘ the results in this paper begin to provide a picture of how local climate has been changing across @entity20			0
it is a picture which is closer to that experienced by individuals			0
’ dr @entity117 concluded : ‘ changes in local climate pose challenges for decision makers across society not just when preparing for the climate of the future but even when planning for the climate of today			0
‘ we need to design buildings so that they do n’t overheat , decide which are the best crops to plant , and even plan for variations in large scale productivity			0
‘ these would all benefit from knowledge of how the climate distribution has changed at particular locations			0
this work begins to provide such information			0

in the @entity7 the hottest 5 **%** of days have got up to 2 ° c hotter
in the @entity9 , the hottest days are not getting hotter so quickly
in northern areas the number of nights during which temperatures fall below zero has decreased most substantially - by at least 10 **%**
