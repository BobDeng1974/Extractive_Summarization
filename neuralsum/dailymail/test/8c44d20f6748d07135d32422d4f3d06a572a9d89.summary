' if he keeps going on like this , that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day , he 's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that i ca n't fight then because of @entity37			1
' and he 's putting down my opponents , who are still better opponents than his opponents , like @entity4 , who should be called no no @entity40 , to be honest with you , because end of day , he 's not done anything in his career			0

' when it comes to @entity1 , who knows @entity1 in @entity86 ? which fighter , apart from @entity87 , knows @entity1 ? @entity81 and @entity54 do n't know who @entity1 is , so i do n't know what he 's going on about trying to say he 's a big name			1
