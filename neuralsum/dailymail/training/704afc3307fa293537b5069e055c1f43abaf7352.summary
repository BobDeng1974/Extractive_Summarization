he died the next morning			0
in january an unannounced inspection by the @entity119 warned the @entity120 to improve its care of patients after receiving several complaints from people who had waited up to three hours for an ambulance to take them to hospital			0
later that month , police officers complained that they were having to take patients to hospital ' on a daily basis ' because no @entity120 ambulances were available , and were regularly having to wait ' an inordinate amount of time ' for their paramedic colleagues to arrive at the scene of an emergency			0
a week later , firefighters warned that something was ' going seriously wrong with the 999 response ' of the @entity120			2
they said they were waiting ' longer and longer ' for ambulances to arrive and found paramedics often arrived alone on motorbikes or cars and were unable to transport patients to hospital			0
@entity147 , of @entity148 , said : ' fire officers tell us of their desperate frustration at being told to wait in line when chasing up emergency requests for the attendance of an ambulance			2
sometimes they are told the ambulance sent to their emergency has been redirected to another call due to there being no other ambulance available			2
' in march , three - month - old @entity104 died after she suffered a fit and the ambulance that was supposed to be taking her to hospital got lost twice			2
the driver had been relying on a satnav and took 26 minutes to reach her at home in @entity168 , more than three times the target time of eight minutes			2
