of all the celebrations planned for the @entity2 , it is perhaps the most fitting			1
stunning jewels created from the largest diamond ever found are to be collected together in public for the first time in a unique exhibition at @entity8			1
they include a brooch containing gems weighing 94.4 carats and 63.3 carats and another heart - shaped piece featuring an 18.8 carat jewel			1
diamond queen : her majesty wears the @entity17 and holds the @entity18 , both of which contain stones cut from the @entity21 in this picture from her @entity23 ... crown jewels : the two largest cuts from the @entity21 were set into the @entity18 , left , and the @entity17 , right @entity21 and @entity26 : the third and fourth largest of the gems - a pear - shaped drop of 94.4 carats ( iii ) and the cushion - shaped 63.3 carat iv - were originally placed by @entity29 on her new crown in 1911			1
the stones were most often worn hooked together as a pendant brooch			0
. @entity21 and vii brooch : many pieces of @entity36 jewellery were created to be versatile			2
as well as the brooch , the 11.5 carat @entity21 has been used in a number of pieces including a diadem			1
@entity21 can be set with the five other numbered @entity42 stones into a radiating platinum mount @entity44 this heart - shaped stone weighs 18.8 carats and is mounted in a fine radiating platinum web with a scrolling millegrain and pave - set border of brilliant diamonds			1
the mounting of the jewel was designed to be as adaptable as possible and was most often worn by @entity29 ( and now by @entity53 ) as a @entity54 also forms the detachable centre section of the diamond and emerald stomacher made for @entity29 for the @entity58 in 1911 and has been worn suspended from the @entity59 all the items – worn regularly by the @entity53 over the past six decades – use gems cut from the incomparable @entity21			1
and the priceless collection ’s history is all the more incredible given the history behind the stone			0
when the diamond was mined in 1905 , it looked nothing more than a worthless crystal – so much so that the manager of the @entity73 mine near @entity74 , @entity75 , threw it out as rubbish			1
it was only on closer inspection that staff were persuaded the piece of rock could be a genuine diamond			0
in fact it turned out to be three times larger than anything discovered before			0
@entity21 ix the smallest of the nine stones , weighing 4.4 carats , was set into a platinum ring for @entity29 in 1911			1
the pear shape is known as a pendeloque and is mounted in an openwork 12 - claw setting			0
it was also inherited by @entity53 in 1953			2
largest of its kind : a glass model replica of the @entity99 diamond in its original rough state precious : the diamond was also cut to produce this @entity21 and @entity26 , commissioned by @entity29 in 1911 , and the @entity102 and @entity103 weighing 3,106 carats in its rough state and measuring 4in by 2.5in by 2.12in , the @entity21 – named after the chairman of the mining company , @entity104 – was also exceptional for its blue - white colour and purity			1
soon after it was found , it was sent to @entity8 for inspection by @entity113 for two years the stone remained a public wonder , but it was hard to find a buyer as there were doubts a stone so big could ever be cut			1
eventually , the prime minister of the @entity122 – then a @entity124 colony – suggested his government should acquire the @entity21 and present it to @entity113 as a token of loyalty			1
in 1907 the uncut stone was brought to @entity130 in @entity131			0
dazzling collection : the @entity23 necklace and earrings , worn by the @entity53 on her @entity23 in 1953 , left , and right , the @entity75 necklace and bracelet , a gift from the @entity138 to the then princess @entity53 on her 21st birthday			1
these gems were not cut from the @entity99 diamond , but will be among those displayed at @entity8 this summer fit for a queen : this small diamond crown , as worn by @entity145 for her official @entity147 portrait in 1870 , will also go on display			1
made by @entity150 , the crown was not made from the @entity21 ... she has worn the @entity17 throughout her 60 - year reign on occasions such as the state opening of parliament ' @entity155 's tiara ' : the @entity53 's favourite tiara , given to her from her grandmother , @entity29 , will be in the exhibition			1
here , she is pictured wearing it in on state visits in 2011 , left , and 1989 , right passed down the generations : the @entity53 as a child , left , with her mother who wore the @entity17 before her , and , right , her grandmother @entity29 who can be seen wearing one of the @entity21 as a brooch cutting the stone was entrusted to the celebrated firm of @entity168 of @entity169			1
it was too large to be cut into a single gem , so cleaving – or sawing – was necessary			2
the girls of @entity174 @entity173 was a wedding present to princess victoria @entity29 , later @entity29 - the @entity53 ’s grandmother - on behalf of the @entity177 and @entity178 in 1893			2
made by jewellers @entity150 and originally crafted with upright pearls around the top and a bandeau base , it was altered in 1920 by @entity29 , who replaced the pearls with diamonds and removed the base			0
it is one of the @entity53 ’s favourites and is forever known as ' @entity155 ’s tiara ' , being a wedding present from her grandmother in 1947			2
it is said to be very light and easy to wear			0
the first blow broke the knife and the diamond remained intact			0
a second attempt split it in two			0
eight months of grinding and polishing followed , with the result of nine principal numbered stones , 96 small brilliants and nine carats of unpolished fragments			0
the total weight of the gems cut from the @entity99 was 1,055.8 carats			0
in 1909 the two largest gems – the biggest colourless and flawless cut diamonds in the world – were formally presented to @entity113 at @entity209 and were eventually set at the head of the @entity18 and in the @entity17			2
both are on display at the @entity213 and will not be in the new exhibition			0
the other seven were mounted for @entity215 and @entity29 – the @entity113 ’s wife and daughter - in - law – to create some of the most dazzling pieces of jewellery in the royal collection			2
now those jewels are to be shown together for the first time			0
the seven stones are contained in five pieces of jewellery			0
a brooch containing two stones – the 94.4 carat @entity21 and 63.3 carat @entity21 ; a second heart - shaped brooch containing @entity44 , which weighs 18.8 carats ; the @entity58 necklace from which @entity231 hangs in a pendant ; a third brooch containing @entity21 and @entity21 ; and a platinum ring featuring the smallest of the nine stones , 4.4 carat @entity21 experts said last night that the value of the @entity21 was impossible to calculate as there has never been a gem like it in terms of size , clarity and colour			1
the jewellery made from it is equally ‘ priceless ’ , not least due to its impeccable royal provenance			0
however , based on a 250 carat diamond that is currently for sale at an estimated £ 500,000 per carat , the jewellery could be worth anything from £ 78million for the @entity254 brooch , £ 9.4million for the @entity21 brooch , £ 4.4million for the @entity231 , £ 5.7million for the @entity21 and @entity256 and £ 2.2million for the @entity21 prince @entity257 has confided how he found out that you ‘ do n’t mess ’ with the @entity53			1
the prince makes the remark in an interview with @entity264 broadcaster @entity262 to be shown to mark the jubilee			0
‘ as i learnt from growing up , you do n’t mess with your grandmother , ’ he said			0
history in the making : @entity270 makes the first cut into the @entity21 in february 1908 - the first blow broke the knife the @entity21 , which weighed 3,106 carats in its rough state , was first discovered in 1905 at a mine near @entity74 in @entity75			1
it was so large that its finders thought it must be crystal so threw it away			2
when its worth was realised , it was recovered and sent to @entity282 to be inspected by @entity113 at @entity8			1
for two years it remained unsold as it was thought to be too big to cut			0
in 1907 , the prime minister of the @entity122 suggested that his government should acquire the @entity21 and present it to @entity113 as a gift			1
under police protection , the uncut stone was conveyed to @entity130 in @entity131 , where the @entity113 was celebrating his 66th birthday			2
the task of cutting the stone was entrusted to the celebrated firm of @entity168 of @entity169			0
after weeks of consideration , including four days spent making the groove into which the steel cleaving knife was to be inserted , the stone was ready to be split - but the first blow broke the knife			2
once cut , grinding and polishing followed , with three polishers working 14 hours a day			0
eventually , they produced nine principal numbered stones , 96 small brilliants and nine carats of unpolished fragments			0
in 1909 , the two largest gems were formally presented to @entity113 at @entity209			2
these are the two largest colourless and flawless cut diamonds in the world			0
the biggest - the @entity21 - was set in the @entity18 and the second gem - the @entity309 - was set in the @entity17			1
both are on now display at the @entity213			0
the other seven were all mounted by @entity150 ’s or @entity311 ’s in a brooches , a ring and a necklace and have been worn by members of the royal family on state occasions			2
in 2012 , seven of the nine stones will go on display in @entity8 in a special exhibition to celebrate @entity53 's diamond jubilee the @entity21 : a @entity323 exhibition will be held from june 30 to july 8 and from july 31 to october 7			1

the @entity21 , weighing 3,106 carats in its rough state , was first discovered in 1905 at a mine near @entity74 in @entity75
it was originally thrown away as it was thought it to be too large to be a diamond
once recovered , it was presented to @entity113 as a gift and cuts were used in the @entity336
other cuts were used to make brooches , necklaces and earrings worn by royalty including @entity53 throughout her 60 - year reign
