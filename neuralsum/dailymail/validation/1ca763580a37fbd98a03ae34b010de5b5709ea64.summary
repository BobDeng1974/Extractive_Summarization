' it felt cold , rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one			0
' i knew @entity3 had once just hung out here and now i stood staring down everything that had been left behind			2
' i loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the @entity35 tub			1
' but the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time			2
' the room was bigger than three of my houses , it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end			0
everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust			0
' as i wandered the halls and rooms i imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls			0
' i looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties , tigers and celebrities			0
' gold - plated fittings line the top of the landing at the vast home which is due to be renovated this year after being bought up in december one of several grand staircases at the @entity0 mansion , once home to the champion boxer once dubbed ' the baddest man on the planet ' the heavy wooden front door opens up to an expanse of black marble but the once stunning home has fallen into disrepair @entity3 decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers , a pool larger than most homes , tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad another grand staircase leads down to the mansion 's man hall with an open fire space at the bottom the boxer was taken into custody in 1991 on allegations of rape and in 1992 a jury found him guilty with the ruling committing him to a six year prison sentence with four years of parole			1
in 1995 @entity3 was granted parole and released from prison , returning to rural @entity4 in hope of escaping the media which ended up following him			1
because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $ 1.3m ( Â£ 870k )			0
it has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an @entity226 investigation when he tried to sell it - and is now set to be converted into a church			0
the current owners bought the property in december 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 , allowing @entity42 to explore before the work takes place			1
the mansion 's descent into disrepair could be said to mirror the former heavyweight champion boxer 's own fall from grace the current owners bought the property in december 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 he added : ' i 've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this			1
' but it 's definitely one of the more well - preserved structures i have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places			0
' it makes a perfect candidate for the church to move into and build their sanctuary			0
structurally the home is wonderful and i ca n't wait to see the restoration completed over time			0
' the group would like for @entity3 to attend the first gathering inside the churches sanctuary			2
' i hope to help by sharing this story far and wide , maybe bringing his attention to this matter			0
it could be quite an experience for him walking through his former home , seeing it brought to a completely different light			0
