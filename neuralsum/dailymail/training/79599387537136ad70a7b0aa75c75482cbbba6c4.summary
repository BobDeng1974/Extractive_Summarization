by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 has said a potential deal to sign @entity6 striker @entity5 is ' dead and buried '			1
the former @entity8 manager was keen on bringing the prolific @entity10 striker to the @entity11 following the departure of @entity13 to @entity14 for Â£ 12million earlier this month			0
@entity2 reported @entity6 were open to selling their star asset , but that they had changed their minds , with the former @entity18 and @entity8 boss now conceding defeat in his pursuit of the @entity22 international			1
staying put : @entity6 striker @entity5 will not be joining @entity3 this summer disappointed : @entity2 now has under a week to sign a replacement for former striker @entity13 ' it 's dead and buried , ' @entity2 said			1
' we got an indication from @entity6 that they were willing to do a deal and that obviously changed in 24 hours			2
' if they 'd have said that to start with - that he was n't for sale no matter what we wanted to do - then fine , we 'll walk away			0
' but unfortunately it gets a bit protracted and last weekend we thought it was close and then all of a sudden he 's not for sale , so we 'll move on to the next one			2
' @entity2 admitted his frustration at coming so close to landing the 24 - year - old , who has scored 53 goals in 93 championship appearances since joining @entity6 two years ago , and blamed the constant scrutiny being placed on the deal			1
' it gets into the public domain and all of a sudden it 's not going to happen , ' @entity2 added			2
' it 's disappointing for everybody concerned , but more disappointing , i would presume , for somebody like @entity5			2
' replacement needed : @entity13 decided to leave @entity3 to join @entity14 earlier this month perhaps understandably , @entity2 was a little more reticent about naming his other targets , but did reveal the club were nearing a deal to boost their forward line			1
' we 're close to one or two things , very close on one in particular , which will be a fantastic addition if we pull it off , but until it 's really , really rubber stamped then i 'm not going to say much , ' he said			0
' i really do n't want to comment after last week 's debacle on @entity5			0
it would be wise of me to say nothing			0
' one person who has already completed his move to east @entity70 this week is defender @entity71 , who signed a three - year deal from @entity73 for an undisclosed fee on tuesday			1
@entity2 is thrilled with his latest acquisition , believing @entity71 's maturity at the back will be vital as @entity3 battle on domestic and @entity80 fronts this season			1
' we 're delighted to get someone of his experience and his ability , ' @entity2 said			0
' i 've always thought that especially in the centre of defence , a little bit of experience does everybody the world of good			0
' it 's been a long drawn out process but we eventually got him which i 'm delighted about			0
' done deal : former @entity73 defender @entity71 became @entity3 's sixth summer signing @entity98 need technology - @entity2			1

@entity2 thought he was close to landing @entity5
however @entity6 have now changed their stance on @entity5 ' future
the @entity3 boss is delighted with the signing of @entity73 's @entity71
