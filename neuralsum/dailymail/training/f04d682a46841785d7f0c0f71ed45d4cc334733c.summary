by @entity0 a @entity2 senator skipped his own fundraiser today to avoid being seen with president @entity4			1
@entity6 sen. @entity5 was slated to appear at a luncheon benefiting his campaign and the @entity9 in @entity10 this afternoon with the president			1
the fundraiser had been on the books for at least a month , and @entity5 , who is up for reelection this year , had touted the joint appearance to supporters			1
@entity5 's campaign suddenly announced this morning that the @entity1 had changed his mind and would stay in @entity19 today instead			1
the only high - ranking @entity20 who would even be seen in pubic with the president during his trip to @entity6 was governor @entity24 - and they ran into each other at the bar			1
@entity2 politicians steered clear of president @entity4 when he came to @entity6 this week none of the state 's top democrats joined the president today at @entity33 in @entity10 , where he gave a speech on the economy and spoke with locals @entity5 , @entity24 and former @entity6 state house speaker and current congressional candidate @entity38 had already said they would not attend a speech the president was giving on the economy this morning in @entity10 's @entity33			1
@entity38 has been on bad terms with the @entity44 since it tried to convince him to stay out of the @entity2 primary for the @entity47 in 2010 to make things easier for sitting @entity2 senator @entity49			2
a spokeman for @entity24 told the @entity51 on monday that the governor was simply booked by the time @entity4 scheduled his remarks			0
' the governor has been confirmed since late may to attend a veterans ' event on wednesday morning in @entity57 , ' said the spokesman , @entity58 , adding that the governor 's office had only just learned of @entity4 's speech			1
' this has nothing to do with wanting to be with him or not			0
this is just logistics , ' @entity5 campaign spokesman @entity65 told the @entity51 when he asked about his boss ' plans			2
' if the president is in town , and the president wants to be helpful , why would anyone want to pass that up ? ' @entity5 campaign consultant @entity70 said			1
' i do n't think one visit by the president is going to change anything in terms of the dynamics of the campaign			0
' ahead of the @entity2 senator 's fundraiser featuring @entity4 today , @entity5 sent an email to supporters telling them how much he was looking forward to introducing them to the president			1
' i 'm grateful for president @entity4 's support in this @entity47 race , and i 'm looking forward to bringing him out to @entity6 for a campaign event , ' @entity5 said , according to the @entity51			1
' but i 'm especially excited to introduce him to you , friend , ' he continued			0
@entity5 's campaign announced this morning , however , that the senator would remain in @entity19 today to vote for @entity4 's nominee to lead the @entity98 , @entity99			1
' @entity5 is grateful for the president 's support , and had hoped to welcome him to @entity6 in person , but his responsibilities to serve @entity6 in the @entity47 come first , ' @entity65 said			1
but @entity99 was expected to be confirmed by the @entity47 with no extreme difficulty and ended up being approved for the post by nearly three quarters of the @entity47			0
sen. @entity5 skipped his own fundraiser today and remained on @entity109 in @entity19 to avoid being seen with president @entity4 republicans said it did n't come as a shock to them that none of the state 's top @entity2 wanted to rub elbows with @entity4 - least of all @entity5 , whose race against @entity117 rep. @entity117 is ranked as a toss - up on polling site @entity119			1
' actions speak louder than words , ' a @entity122 statement said today			0
' it ’s clear that the president is beyond toxic , and @entity5 ’s campaign is running scared			2
' ' it ’s hardly surprising that @entity131 and sen. @entity5 are doing everything they can to run away from the worst president since @entity136 , ' @entity129 chairman @entity128 said in a statement on monday , referring to a recent @entity139 poll in which @entity4 was rated the least liked president since 1945			1
@entity4 has a 38 percent approval rating in @entity6 , according to @entity142 , and @entity143 says he has a marginally higher 43 percent approval rating nationally			2
' i do n't think there are accidents when it comes to the president 's schedule , and i do n't think there are accidents when it comes to senators and members of @entity158 and their schedules , ' @entity145 , an analyst for the non-partisan @entity146 , told the @entity51 earlier this week			0
the only current politician who was willing to hang out with @entity4 in pubic was governor @entity24 , right , who ran into the president at a bar @entity24 used to own the bar , @entity165 , and was hanging out there when @entity4 dropped by the @entity6 governor then challenged the president to a game of pool			1
' i took his lunch money , ' @entity4 told a group of donors today @entity24 ended up hanging out with @entity4 at a bar last night , but the meet - up does n't appear to have been preplanned			2
@entity4 said he was having a drink nearby with some locals and decided to drop by @entity165 , an establishment @entity24 used to own			2
the @entity6 governor just happened to be there at the time , and invited the president to play a game of pool			0
or at least that 's how @entity4 made the encounter sound during his remarks at this afternoon 's fundraiser			2
' you can ask him how that went , ' @entity4 said of the pool game			0
' i took his lunch money			0
' @entity4 also mentioned @entity5 in his remarks , saying he ' is a serious person who is trying to do the right thing and who has the values that we share			2
' ' he is not an ideologue			0
he does n’t agree with me on everything , ' @entity4 admitted			0
' but he believes in the core idea that i think should be what @entity2 are all about , this idea that if you work hard you should be able to make it , ' he said			0
' and that ’s worth supporting			0
' @entity5 's absence from the fundraiser was made more noticeable by the fact that he is the only candidate whom @entity4 has campaigned for directly this year			1
the proceeds for other events @entity4 has appeared at this year went directly to the @entity2			2
half of the donations from today 's event - which cost as much as $ 15,000 a couple to attend - will go directly to @entity5			1
@entity5 is not alone , however , in his attempts to avoid the unpopular president this election year			0
@entity218 senator @entity217 , who is also caught up in a touch reelection battle , stayed in @entity19 when @entity4 came to her state , too			1
@entity222 sen. @entity221 said in january that if the president ever came to @entity222 he would n't campaign with him			0
' i do n’t need him campaigning for me — i need him to change some of his policies , ' the endangered @entity20 said			0
' if he wants to come up there and learn about @entity222 , bring it on — i ’ll drag him around , i ’ll show him whatever he wants to see , ' he said , but campaigning is a no - go			0
' i ’m not really interested in campaigning			0

@entity6 sen. @entity5 was supposed to attend a fundraiser benefiting his reelection campaign today in @entity10 that featured president @entity4
at the last minute the @entity1 decided to stay in @entity19
two other high - *profile* democrats in the state also skipped the fundraiser
@entity4 's unpopularity is scaring away @entity2 politicians
