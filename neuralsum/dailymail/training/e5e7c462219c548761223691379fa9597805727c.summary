a diplomatic storm was brewing last night over @entity2 swimming sensation @entity1			1
the @entity4 16 - year - old was forced to deny using drugs after a respected @entity7 coach called her gold medal - winning performance ‘ unbelievable ’			1
but her defiant pledge that the world record - breaking swim on saturday – which saw her outpace the winner of the men ’s event – came purely from ‘ hard work and training ’ failed to defuse a doping controversy gripping @entity21			1
scroll down for @entity23 reaction record breaker : @entity1 knocked five seconds off her personal best and broke the world record by more than a second as she stormed to gold in the 400m individual medley in the @entity21 beaten : @entity29 , pictured , was slower than @entity1 over the last 50 metres of his own medley race @entity31 , the @entity7 executive director of the @entity32 , described saturday ’s swim by ‘ @entity34 ’ miss @entity1 – who last night broke the @entity2 record in another event – as ‘ unbelievable ’ and ‘ disturbing ’			1
he also made the extraordinary suggestion that the @entity4 could be using genetic manipulation to enhance performances			2
outspoken : top @entity7 swimming coach @entity31 called the feat ' unbelievable ' his claims came as anti-doping officials revealed that cleaners and security staff have been asked to spy on athletes in the @entity47 and report anything suspicious that could be linked to performance - enhancing drugs			1
miss @entity1 ’s gold medal came in the 400m individual medley , in which she swam the last 50m of the freestyle leg in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds that 27 - year - old @entity7 @entity29 managed in the men ’s event minutes earlier			1
her time for the whole event was more than five seconds better than her previous best			0
pressed on the use of drugs she told the @entity68 last night : ‘ there is absolutely no problem with doping			2
the @entity4 have always had a firm policy about doping			1
my results come from hard work and training and i would never use any banned drugs			0
the @entity4 people have clean hands			2
’ but mr @entity31 compared the final 100m swum by @entity1 as being ‘ reminiscent ’ of some old @entity74 swimmers , several of whom were subsequently exposed for using performance - enhancing drugs			1
he said miss @entity1 looks like @entity76 , adding : ‘ any time someone has looked like @entity76 in the history of our sport they have later been found guilty of doping			1
’ if someone could outpace one of the fastest male swimmers in the world and finish three - and - a - half lengths ahead of her nearest female rival , he said , ‘ all those things , i think , legitimately call that swim into question ’			0
head and shoulders above : the teenager ( centre ) holds an unassailable lead during her gold medal winning 400 metre medley race @entity1 said her success was due to her training since she was identified as a potential champion medal winners : @entity1 shows off the gold alongside the @entity7 ' @entity103 , left , and compatriot @entity104 following the final mr @entity31 also called for an investigation into the @entity4 , saying they could be using genetic manipulation			1
‘ it is a result that demands an explanation – it is unprecedented , ’ he told the @entity109			0
genetic manipulation in animals , he said , had given added strength and oxygen usage			0
‘ who knows what it can do to humans ? ’ he added			0
questions over @entity1 's performance come after a string of @entity4 swimmers tested positive for doping in recent years			1
@entity4 won 12 of the 16 women 's titles at the 1994 world championships in @entity128 but these achievements were sullied less than a month later when seven @entity4 swimmers tested positive for banned drugs at the @entity132 in @entity133			1
at the 1998 world championships in @entity136 , four @entity4 competitors were sent home after testing positive for steroids			1
it came a week after one of their team mates and her coach were caught smuggling human growth hormone at @entity145			0
@entity4 's top backstroke swimmer and record holder @entity146 , now 29 , was given a lifetime ban after he tested positive for the same substance a month before the @entity150			1
the ban was later changed to two years			0
in 2009 , five junior @entity4 swimmers were banned for two years by the country 's swimming association after they tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol - a performance - enhancing drug			1
and in june @entity4 state media said 16 - year - old @entity158 , part of the country ’s winning team at the @entity162 , had tested positive for a performance - enhancing drug , @entity163 , which boosts the body ’s oxygen supplies			2
and he said miss @entity1 ’s performance had brought ‘ back a lot of awful memories ’ of @entity171 swimmer @entity170 ’s winning performance at the @entity172 in 1996			2
@entity170 was banned for four years in 1998 for tampering with a drugs test			0
as a gold medal winner , miss @entity1 will have been automatically drug - tested			2
the first four in each race are routinely tested			0
last night she continued her astonishing success by setting a new @entity2 record in the semi-finals of her best event , the 200m individual medley , with a time of 2 mins 8.39 seconds			2
@entity182 , @entity183 2012 ’s head of anti-doping , said that organisers had made security , cleaning , events services and others ‘ very aware of the issue of doping , so if they were to come across practices , paraphernalia , whatever it may be , then they would bring it to our attention and , of course , we would investigate this and treat it as intelligence			0
’ a source close to the @entity204 swimming team , who did not want to be named , said yesterday : ‘ there has been a lot of talk since saturday about the @entity4 swimmers , particularly @entity1 , and how they are managing to come out of nowhere and achieve these incredible times			1
' we all know about the kind of punishing regimes the @entity4 swimmers are put through			2
’ one insight came on sunday			0
after winning silver in the 100m butterfly , @entity4 athlete @entity216 said : ‘ in @entity4 we ’re used to study , study and train , train and then rest			0
i think our way of thinking has many limits			0
in @entity227 i ’ve been invited to barbecues with my teammates – that would never happen in @entity4			0
’ officials say there have been 1,461 drug tests carried out so far in this @entity21 – no results are yet known – and that testers can take samples at any time			0
prof @entity238 , board member of @entity239 and director of sport at the @entity241 , said : ' the drug testing procedures in place at the @entity21 are extremely rigorous and the storage of samples for eight years after the @entity132 makes doping an very high risk strategy			0
' we should not be surprised by exceptional performances since @entity249 winning athletes are inevitably different to the rest of us due to their talent , training and lifestyles			0
' it 's also worth remembering that @entity4 has a vast pool of talent to choose from due to the size of its population , so we should not be too surprised when an individual with exceptional talent emerges			2
' congratulations : @entity1 hugs @entity104 after her victory at the @entity264 at the @entity265 sensation : @entity1 managed to swim the final 50m length in the race in a time of 28.93 , a time that was quicker than the men 's champion @entity29 disappointed : @entity29 shakes hand with @entity274 after they won silver in the 4x100m relay reminiscent ? @entity171 swimmer @entity170 won four medals in @entity279 in 1996 - but was later found to have contaminated drug tests in an attempt to hide drug use			1

@entity4 swimmer @entity1 smashed world record by a second and her own personal best by five seconds
coach @entity31 said history suggested doping could be involved
called feat ' *impossible* ' and said tests would prove if she had taken drugs
