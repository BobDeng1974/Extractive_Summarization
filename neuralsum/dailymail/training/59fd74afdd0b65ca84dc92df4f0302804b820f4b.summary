sentencing a criminal to 1,000 years in an artificial hell may one day become a reality			0
at least , that is the claim of scientists at @entity5 who have been exploring controversial technologies that could extend human life			2
they say billions are being invested in techniques that could mean the cruellest criminals will be kept alive indefinitely in condition befitting their crime			0
last year , a team of scientists led by @entity13 began exploring technologies that could keep prisoners in an artificial hell according to their research , prison firms could also develop drugs that make time pass slowly , making an inmate ’s sentence feel like an eternity			1

‘ some crimes are so bad they require a really long period of punishment , and a lot of people seem to get out of that punishment by dying , ’ dr @entity13 told @entity26 in @entity27			2
dr @entity13 highlights what she describes as the ‘ laughably inadequate ’ sentence of 30 years in prison for @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 died in march 2012 from a head injury , locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress			0
dr @entity13 highlights the ' laughably inadequate ' sentence of 30 years in prison for @entity37 and @entity38 @entity39 's mother @entity38 ( right ) and stepfather @entity38 ( left ) were found guilty of murder life extension technologies could mean the cruellest criminals will be kept alive indefinitely in condition befitting their crime			1
as well as extending life , there are a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people ’s sense of time			0
dr @entity13 said that might not be far off developing a pill that could make someone feel like they were serving a 1,000 - year sentence			1
another scenario explored by the group is uploading the criminal 's mind to a digital realm to speed up the 1,000 year sentence			1
this means that with sufficient computer power , it would be possible to speed up the rate at which an uploaded mind runs			0
similarly , uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight - and - a - half hours			1
the pair were convicted of murdering @entity37 's four year - old son , @entity39 , who was beaten , starved and tortured before his death			0
on her @entity80 blog , dr @entity13 notes that @entity37 and @entity38 will receive the humane treatment that @entity39 never did			2
‘ they will , for example , be fed and watered , housed in clean cells , allowed access to a toilet and washing facilities , allowed out of their cells for exercise and recreation , ’ she writes			0
turning to human engineering as a possible solutions , dr @entity13 looks at the idea of life span enhancements so that a life sentence in prison could last hundreds of years			1
‘ dr @entity97 , co-founder of the anti-ageing @entity99 research foundation , believes that the first person to live to 1,000 years has already been born , ’ she said			0
‘ the benefits of such radical lifespan enhancement are obvious - but it could also be harnessed to increase the severity of punishments ’ as well as extending life , dr @entity13 noted that there are a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people ’s sense of time			1

the technology could be used on the most serious crimes , such as those committed by @entity126 ‘ of course , there is a widely held view that any amount of tinkering with a person ’s brain is unacceptably invasive , ’ she said			0
‘ but you might not need to interfere with the brain directly			0
’ time distortion , for instance , is already a technique used in interrogation , where people are exposed to constant light , or unusual light changes , so that they ca n’t tell what time of day it is			2
another scenario being explored by the group is uploading the criminal 's mind to a digital realm to speed up the 1,000 year sentence			1
‘ as the technology required to scan and map human brain processes improves , some believe it will one day be possible to upload human minds on to computers , ’ dr @entity13 said			2
this means that with sufficient computer power , it would be possible to speed up the rate at which an uploaded mind runs			0
prison firms could also soon develop drugs that make time pass slowly , making an inmate ¿ s sentence feel like an eternity similarly , uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight - and - a - half hours			1
‘ this would , obviously , be much cheaper for the taxpayer than extending criminals ’ lifespans to enable them to serve 1,000 years in real time , ’ said dr @entity13			1
if these technologies are developed , one crime that could ever justify eternal imprisonment was something that would endanger mankind			0
‘ suppose there was some physics experiment that stood a decent chance of generating a black hole that could destroy the planet and all future generations , ’ said dr @entity13			2
' if someone deliberately set up an experiment like that , i could see that being the kind of supercrime that would justify an eternal sentence			0

this is the scenario being explored by researchers at @entity5
they claim life extension tech could mean prisoners serve longer sentences
*philosopher* dr @entity13 also writes in her blog that a time distortion pill could make people feel like they were in prison longer
another scenario the group looked at was uploading mind to a digital realm
running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight - and - a - half hours
