by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 21 november 2013 the party is a grand one , a vast room , buzzing with conversation and the glamour of the capital 's movers and shakers			2
i 'd hesitated to attend			2
' not my sort of thing , ' i 'd blustered , when the impressive ' stiffie ' invitation had arrived , with its embossed writing and matching ribbon			2
' no , ' insisted friends and family , ' you should go			2
it 'll be a great opportunity for networking , meeting people who can advance your career			1
' wallflower : @entity0 said she wo n't make herself the centre of attention at @entity27 parties so , here i am , surrounded by the editor of this , the manager of that			1
good grief , there 's the home secretary and could that be the @entity34 ? i brace myself to go over , smile , charm , show them how brilliant and interesting i am			1
i scan the room , desperate to find someone i actually know , before finding a quiet corner , sitting down with my drink and hoping someone will come and talk to me			2
i realise that with my persona as the confident presenter of a major national radio programme , thought to have nerves of steel when questioning the toughest of subjects and listened to by millions , the role of wallflower seems an unlikely one			1
but shy and somewhat retiring on a personal level , i most definitely am			2
when , on these occasions , someone does eventually spot me , and sidles over out of chivalry or sympathy to chat , i automatically switch to professional mode , and do what i 've always done best			2
i offer the platform to them , and interview them , giving them the opportunity to set out their talents and achievements , while i sit back and listen			2
there is nothing like a dame : but she does n't like to show off about her title of course , this talent came in very handy as i was starting out as a young journalist			1
but today , despite a long career in television and radio and being recognised with the title ' dame ' , i ’m afraid i have n't progressed			1
with @entity27 and the party season approaching , i know i 'll still be trying to avoid the big events and , if i have to go , i 'll still seek out familiar and congenial chums with whom to have a chat and , if they 're not there , i 'll turn again into the hopeful wallflower , ready to question anyone who joins me about themselves			0
i dread to think how many fabulous opportunities i might have missed because i ’m congenitally incapable of showing off			0
i might have been the @entity91 equivalent of @entity92 - a world famous political interviewer for more than half a century and fabulously rich to boot - if only i could have learned to blow my own trumpet			1
or maybe i could have been an @entity96 , my contemporary in age - she 's about to turn 60 and i 'm 63			1
she has just starred in a movie , set up her own tv company and is considered by @entity101 to be the most wealthy and powerful ' celebrity ' woman in the world			1
as interviewers , there 's probably not much between us			0
she even commented , during a recent interview i did with her in a @entity111 hotel , on my ' insightful ' questioning			0
i 'm absolutely certain i could have lured @entity112 into spilling the beans on his drug use or had @entity115 dancing on the sofa - two of her most memorable recent journalistic scoops - given the opportunity			0
it was during my encounter with @entity96 that i realised what a difference to one 's confidence and , consequently , one 's prospects the ability to show off can make			1
within seconds of the start of our conversation , the subject had turned to her : she was telling me about her humble background in @entity137 's @entity136			1
' my reluctance to blow my own trumpet , has let me down on a number of occasions ' her great - grandmother was a slave , she pointed out , instantly highlighting the phenomenal leap she has made			0
her mother was a maid , until @entity96 had enough money to help her retire			1
she acknowledged her luck in being born into the era when the civil rights movement began to bite and gave her the opportunity for non-segregated education			0
but she was quick to point out that , when she started nursery at three , she could read and knew lots of big words , thanks to her grandmother using the @entity158 to teach her			0
she wrote a letter to her teacher , including all those words - even the biblical characters @entity162 and @entity162			0
she was immediately put into the @entity164 and , of course , was top of her class			0
she knew how to push herself forward without embarrassment or shame from babyhood			0
and here she was , doing it again , while , typically , i remained silent			0
i could have told her that i , too , was considered a bright little girl : my mother told me i was able to read by the age of three			1
i would read the cereal packet on the breakfast table , because books were n’t allowed at meal times			0
she was so worried about me scouring the @entity180 every morning - an adult publication , she thought - she bought me the @entity182 to satisfy my hunger for material			0
powerful : @entity0 wonders what might have been if she was more like @entity96 i was so desperate for education , they had to send me to the local @entity188 , even though we were n't @entity190 , because it was the only establishment that would take me at the age of three			1
it would never have occurred to me to show off about such promising beginnings			1
( ok , i just did , but it 's taken me 60 years to do so ! ) i know my reticence on these matters , my reluctance to blow my own trumpet , has let me down on a number of occasions			0
as a sixth - former i desperately wanted to study drama at @entity204			0
i was called for interview			0
faced by a panel of inquisitors , i mumbled my responses to their questions and , even when asked about my favourite playwrights , played down my considerable knowledge			0
i made it to my second choice - @entity214 solely on the basis of academic achievement			0
they did n't subject potential students to an interview ! something similar happened when i first applied to the @entity221			1
i was unsure and nervous			0
i managed to answer questions about technical matters			0
my dad had coached me in the workings of a microphone , but this avid reader of newspapers and follower of current events fell to bits when asked about the whereabouts of the prime minister			0
that little voice in my head , yet again , said : ' do n't get above yourself			1
you do n't belong here			1
' i failed to show off my knowledge			1
i do n't think it 's a problem confined to my generation			1
my children and their contemporaries , never told by their parents that they 're anything but bright and as good as anybody else , are still reluctant to be seen as ' bigging themselves up '			0
there is , i believe , a cultural phenomenon at play here			1
in @entity137 , children are encouraged in school to ' show and tell '			1
they stand up in front of the class and learn how to speak in public and show themselves off to their friends			1
it 's a culture that says : ' if you 've got it , flaunt it			0
' in this country we still do n't talk about what we 've achieved or what we 've earned			1
saucy show - offs boasting on social networks gives a similar thrill to sex , say @entity269 researchers every woman i 've asked about their concept of power after they 've appeared on the @entity275 - a list of the 100 @entity91 women considered to wield real power in this country - has played down the idea they 're powerful and , rather apologetically , confessed , maybe , to influence			1
i do n't , though , see it overall as affecting one gender more than the other			2
my dad would never disclose how much he earned in case it was more than the next man and would set him apart			0
and i 've known plenty of boys who ca n't shake off that essentially @entity292 trait - boasting about yourself just is n't done			1
when i went to @entity294 in 2011 to be declared @entity0 for my services to radio by the @entity297 , still at the back of my mind was my mother 's cautionary voice : ' do n’t show off			2
do n't get above yourself			2
a working - class girl from @entity304 is bound to get found out sooner or later			0
' perhaps it 's because , in @entity137 , wealth and power is the fulfilment of the ' dream ' - to be lauded			1
we still seem to build up our icons and then , at the merest hint of them ' getting too big for their boots ' , we bring them down			0
it 's time we stopped and took pride in what we 've created - as a society and as individuals - and learned to show off about it			2
so , here 's me taking my own advice			0
i really think i 've done rather well , do n't you ? ( ooh ! sorry ! )			2

despite long career in broadcasting and title ' dame ' she still ca n't show off
compares herself to @entity96 who , at a similar age , is powerful and confident
could it be down to cultural differences between @entity91 and @entity137 ?
