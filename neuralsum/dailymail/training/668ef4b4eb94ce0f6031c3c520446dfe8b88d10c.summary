but this idyllic 12th century church could not survive the fire that ripped through it hours before last sunday 's service			1
the once - iconic wooden vestry was destroyed , leaving its bells missing amid the rubble			1
almost destroyed : the original roof and many pews were destroyed in the blaze that tore through the church firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , just three - and - a - half hours before its regular sunday service			1
too dangerous for them to go inside , they used six pumps to put out the flames and stayed for several hours to prevent the fire flaring again			1
only some of the church 's treasures , including an irreplaceable 1613 ' chained ' @entity29 , were saved			1
a 13th century wooden chest was badly damaged and a limestone font , with graffiti from 1681 , was severely damaged , possibly beyond repair			1
the @entity36 , in memory of a much - loved churchwarden @entity35 , was destroyed			1
the bells of @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , the same ones from 1212 , have been lost in the rubble around half of the roof at the west end has been gutted but the east end is relatively unscathed , including a 13th century screen			1
churchwarden @entity45 said : ' i ca n't really believe it			2
' i was called by a neighbour who saw smoke and i could hear the crackling			2
' the most shocking thing was seeing the flames			0
as far as i know we have never had a fire before			0
' if the fire brigade had not got here the roof would have been completely destroyed			0
' they have been wonderful , as have all the neighbours who raised the alarm			0
' my husband @entity62 and daughter @entity63 , who were first on the scene , saw things falling off the roof			0
church warden @entity45 , standing outside , is distraught after the church 's first fire in 900 years ' there was not a lot we could do			2
' churchgoer @entity72 said : ' it is awful to see something like this happen to something that has stood here for so long			0
' the little 20 metres by eight metres church was due to hold a sunday service at 11am for its 20 regular worshippers			1
however , parishioners gathered for prayers in a nearby house with @entity84			0
the alarm was raised at 7.27am and the cause of the blaze is unclear and is still being investigated			0
fire borough commander @entity89 said : ' the damage is quite extensive			0
' the fire started at one end and spread into the roof and , unfortunately , half has been destroyed			0
' it was a well - developed fire when the first crews arrived but the crews worked incredibly hard to stop it spreading			2
