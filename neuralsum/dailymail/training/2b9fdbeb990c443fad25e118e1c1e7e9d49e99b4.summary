by @entity0 published : 21:10 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 21:11 est , 31 august 2012 at the end of the first week of school the teenagers poured into the crowded suburban discotheque by the dozens , leaving their backpacks at the door			2
they rushed onto a dance floor covered in shoulder - high soap suds and started shaking their hips , some grinding against each other in the sexually suggestive dance that is the trademark of this city 's newest youth craze			1
thousands of lower - income @entity17 teens have become obsessive imitators of a @entity21 subculture based on garish street fashions and the throbbing blend of reggae , hip - hop , and latin music called ' reggaeton			1
' nearly every weekend for more than a year , youths known as reggaetoneros have amassed by the hundreds in metro stations before heading off to dance at clubs or clandestine parties , taking over entire subway cars and singing their favourite songs as loudly as possible			2
new craze : youth known as ' reggaetoneros ' dance at a discotheque in @entity40 , in a suburb of @entity17			1
thousands of lower - income @entity17 teens have become obsessive imitators of a @entity21 subculture lost cause : @entity45 , a ' reggaetonero ' and a follower of @entity47 , the @entity49 saint of lost causes , poses for a photo near the @entity53 church in @entity17 , right , two more ' reggaetoneros ' ready to party : young women known as a pose for a photo outside a discotheque in @entity40 , in a suburb of @entity17 but @entity17 , a bastion of liberalism in a conservative country , is showing little tolerance for poor , raucous youth imitating a foreign subculture most have seen only on the @entity67			1
reggaetoneros are increasingly being met with open hostility and even violence			2
last month , hundreds clashed with police after a party was cancelled in the downtown nightlife district called the @entity75 because more people showed up than could fit into the bar where it was being held			2
authorities said that as many as 600 angry youths who could n't get into the club went on a rampage at local subway stations , damaging turnstiles and streetlamps			2
police detained 200 of the young people			2
none were charged , and they were released within a day			2
two weeks later , reggaetoneros gathering at the @entity92 metro station were assaulted by a group of young men who had planned their attack on @entity96			0
surveillance cameras caught more than a dozen young men kicking a prone reggaetonero and whipping him with their belts			0
the facebook page was one of at least a dozen launched in the last year that urges people to kill or beat up reggaetoneros			0
@entity109 videos ridicule reggaeton music and the way its fans dress			1
night at the club : large glasses and brightly - coloured clothes are all part of the trend ... ... and for men , hair in cropped bowls or gelled mohawks are allt he rage , as are wide - brimmed baseball caps many of the attackers are members of porros , descendants of informal student groups created by the government in the 1960s to quell student uprisings			1
today , they have transformed themselves into youth gangs that operate out of high schools and universities , where authorities have limited powers to enter			0
a member of one porro group , who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal , said the groups have beaten up reggaetoneros on at least four or five occasions because ' they feel superior and are acting like the metro stations belong to them			0
' sociologists say , however , that reggaetoneros are being stigmatized because they come from rough neighbourhoods and because of the way they dress			0
dance dance revolution : the teens dance at a discotheque in @entity40 as dry ice machines spray mist into the club craze : teens shaking their hips , some grinding against each other in the sexually suggestive dance that is the trademark of this city 's newest youth craze @entity168 reggaetoneros of both sexes tend to tweeze their eyebrows and wear skin - tight , neon - coloured pants , loud jewellery , thick - framed eyeglasses and bedazzled baseball caps worn sideways			1
the boys wear their hair in cropped bowls or gelled mohawks			0
girls dress in tight , spangled tops , their bangs gelled to their foreheads			0
the sexually explicit lyrics of reggaeton and the music 's iconic dance move known as ' perreo , ' or dancing doggy style , has also made them a target			1
a facebook page that describes reggaeton as ' grotesque , stupid noise that obstructs neurons ' calls on people to ' end with that horrible plague ' and to kill reggaetoneros ' for your country			1
' @entity199 , who coordinates the youth research seminar of @entity17 's @entity201 , or @entity202 , says the kids just want to have fun			1
sweet beats : @entity206 , 17 , records a reggeaton tune in a makeshift home recording studio in @entity17 producing : @entity209 , 19 , monitors in the makeshift home recording studio ' these types of groups are the only outlet these youths have to socialize , ' said @entity215			1
' most do n't go to school , and many work in the informal economy ; their families are in total crisis and most have to socialize on the street and in groups			0
' while reggaeton has been popular in @entity17 for at least seven years , reggaeton fans began forming clubs , or combos as they call them , on @entity96 about two years ago , when the groups began showing up at subway stations they picked as a gathering point			1
' they plan to meet in known places because most do n't know the city and they accompany each other to get to the ( party ) venue because in a group the trip is safer , ' @entity215 said			0
with clubs with names like ' @entity241 , ' ' @entity242 , ' ' @entity243 , ' ' @entity244 , ' and ' the @entity245 ' - after the yogurt brand - the teenagers post photos of their outings , exchange music , gossip and news about upcoming dances			1
break it down : a teen dances in front of the @entity257 in @entity17 while others look on youth of a nation : the teens are pictured gathering outside the church near an open - air market low riders : a ' reggaetonero ' couple dance a move called the ' perreo , ' or dancing doggy style , in front of the @entity257 in @entity17 @entity267 , 18 , lives in a two - bedroom house with six other family members in a working - class neighbourhood downtown			1
she dropped out of high school to help her ailing mother and now works three days a week at a quesadilla stand , earning $ 11 a week for her work			0
last year , a friend invited her to join the @entity277 combo and she did because it was free and reggaeton nightclubs often give a discount on the $ 2 to $ 4 cover charge when people arrive in a large group			1
' for me , it 's a way to clear my mind for a while , to have fun , ' said @entity290			0
but for @entity292 , a 17 - year - old high school student , those clubs may be a thing of the past			2
he used to belong to a club that often met at a metro station about an hour 's subway ride from the capital 's downtown			0
because of the negative attention , many of the teenagers are now trying for a lower profile , preferring to travel in small groups to their dances			0
and @entity292 has opted to forego the clubs altogether			0
' rivalries with other groups started and it became a big mess , ' he said , ' so i decided to leave			0
