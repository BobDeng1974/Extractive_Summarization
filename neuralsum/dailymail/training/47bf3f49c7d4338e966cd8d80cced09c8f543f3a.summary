by @entity0 it ’s long been thought that in order to succeed in life you need to think only of yourself and ignore the needs of others			0
new research , however , suggests the exact opposite is true and being nice to others actually stands you in greater stead to be successful			2
the scientists found that ‘ givers ’ were more likely to share knowledge , and in turn gain more information themselves			1
researchers in @entity17 found that people who shared knowledge ( stock image shown ) were more likely to be successful			1
they asked participants to decide whether to share money or keep it			1
those that shared it would double their money - but only if others did most people have a favourite list of songs they use to motivate themselves before a sports game or during a workout , but is there any science behind this idea ? according to a study it turns out there is - music truly does make us feel powerful , but not all songs have the same effect			1
researchers found some music empowers you to do great things , and levels of bass are a key factor in its effectiveness			2
' when watching major sports events , my coauthors and i frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room , ' says dr @entity57 of the @entity58 at @entity59 in @entity60			0
' the ways these athletes immerse themselves in the music - some with their eyes steely shut and some gently nodded along the beats - seem as if the music is mentally preparing and toughening them up for the competition about to occur			0
' researchers at the @entity68 in @entity17 divided participants into three groups based on a personality test : givers , takers and matchers			1
in a social dilemma task , participants were allotted a fictitious endowment of the equivalent of £ 240 ( $ 400 )			0
they were then asked to decide how much of their money they would give to a shared group pool			1
they were told that the money in the pool would be doubled and divided equally among all group members			0
thus , it would be more beneficial to the group as a whole if everyone contributed their individual endowments			0
however , it would be more beneficial at the individual level if everyone else from the group contributed , while the individual kept his or her own endowment			0
the researchers used this strategic information sharing task to examine how much and which pieces of information participants shared : the less important and already known information or the really important information only known by the individual			2
the results showed that givers are less self - oriented and narcissistic than takers			1
they found there was a clear distinction between ' givers ' and ' takers '			1
and the results showed being nice means you share information more			1
this means that givers are more likely to gain knowledge than takers and thus be more successful ( stock image shown ) moreover , compared to the traditional classification of prosocials , individualists and competitors , this new classification of givers , matchers and takers was better at predicting behaviours measured two weeks later			1
givers shared not only more money with the group , but they also shared important information			2
takers on the other hand kept both the money as well as different types of information			2
the findings suggest that it may not be enough to simply provide knowledge management tools in order to optimise knowledge exchange in a group of people			0
it may be necessary for leaders and managers to keep in mind the personality and interaction styles of their employees			0
specifically , they should be wary that takers may keep the important information for themselves .			0
