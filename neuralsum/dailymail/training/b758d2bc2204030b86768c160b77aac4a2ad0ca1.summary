by @entity0 published : 02:52 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 04:48 est , 18 may 2013 if you visit @entity2 today in the shadow of the skyscrapers of @entity5 , you ’ll find a £ 550 - a - night @entity6 and thousands of wealthy bankers			1
but back in 19th century @entity9 , it was a bustling storage area for goods imported from the @entity11			2
the @entity12 were built to great fanfare at the end of the 18th century as a response to overcrowding and theft in the riverside quays			1
the @entity38 - now a @entity40 pub - was where dock records were kept and the original gateway was just beyond this point			0
manual workers at the docks were employed as casuals , and would queue at the dock gates for the ‘ call - on ’ when some would be chosen to work			1
these men were often half - starved and desperate to work - but if they were picked , their jobs were backbreaking			2
in addition , the abrasive sugar leaking from the sacks rubbed their necks , shoulders and hands raw - giving the quayside the old name of @entity59			0
the docks were heavily bombed during the @entity61 and after the @entity63 the warehouses were replaced by modern storage sheds			1
lifted up : a group of men watch at @entity67 in 1968 as four elephants return from a @entity70 's circus tour of @entity71 hard work : the @entity12 of east @entity9 are pictured circa 1935 , with bananas being loaded onto rail trucks on the @entity21 of the @entity75 from abroad : sugar sacks are pictured at the rear of a building in this undated photo from when an era when @entity2 was a thriving area for importation today : the rear of the building is pictured nowadays , showing a much quieter scene than would have greeted workers there in the 19th century these no longer exist but you can still see cranes used in the 1960s , before dock closures began in the 1970s , mainly due to containerisation			1
the @entity9 upriver docks were not large enough to receive the new ships - and so the @entity92 down the river in @entity94 were developed			0
the building then became derelict - but in 2000 work began on restoring and converting the grade i - listed building for use as a museum			2
now , the @entity32 sits in one of only two remaining warehouses erected on the north quay by the @entity12			1
originally built in the 1800s by wealthy merchants and slave plantation owners , these buildings once held great cargoes of sugar , rum and coffee			0
transport : the @entity21 of @entity12 in 1925			0
manual workers at the docks were employed as casuals , and would queue at the dock gates for the ' call - on ' today : nowadays the @entity32 sits in one of only two remaining warehouses erected on the north quay by the @entity12 days gone by : the no. 1 warehouse on the @entity21 of @entity12 , with the old transit sheds in front , taken in july 1913 by @entity122 and sons present day : the same scene is photographed today , with the @entity32 to the left			1
now more than 93,000 people work in @entity5 from above today : @entity5 got its name from the fact that many of the imports which arrived there in the past when it was a dock were from the @entity134 each storey was once a different height - dictated by the cargo 's nature			1
the ground floors were made to store two tiers of hogsheads of ‘ clayed ’ sugar			0
the upper floors stored a single tier of the heavier hogsheads of muscovado sugar , while the top floors held lighter cargoes such as coffee and cocoa			0
now the wider area of @entity5 is one of @entity9 's two main financial centres and is home to the likes of @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			2
the 97 - acre estate got its name from the fact that many of the imports which arrived there in the past when it was a dock were from the @entity134			0
around 15million sq ft of office and retail space now exist on the site , with the first tenants arriving in 1991			0
now more than 93,000 people work there			1
