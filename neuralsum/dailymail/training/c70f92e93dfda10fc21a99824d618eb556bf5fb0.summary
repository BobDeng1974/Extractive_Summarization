lt @entity10 was initially believed to have been shot and killed immediately after being captured by the @entity11 following his 4,000ft parachuting out of his @entity12			1
he had collided midair with his wingman while out on patrol over @entity16 , @entity17			0
helping hand : villagers from @entity20 who helped uncover the plane flown by @entity10 , whose nieces stood behind the @entity25 flag ( left to right ) are @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
@entity29 is pictured at the rear			2
but a dogged forensic investigation has discovered he was in fact beaten , tried to flee in an inflatable dinghy and was captured by a @entity11 @entity35 patrol boat			0
he was then kept chained inside a hut for six months , before being killed and buried near an airstrip			1
retired @entity39 nursery owner @entity29 , researching the air combat incident , became fascinated with the case and persevered for 31 years to find ' the truth '			1
and the 60 - year - old 's discoveries enabled him to take @entity10 's three nieces - @entity27 , @entity26 and @entity28 - to the site of their downed uncle 's aircraft			1
it was back in 1981 when @entity29 , who studies @entity4 air combat incidents to then track down dogfighters to try and reunite them , first learned from @entity52 military records that @entity11 @entity53 had seen an @entity5 pilot in captivity in march 1945			2
they said his name was ' @entity58 ' , and records detailed he was killed shortly after being captured - and following his attempt to escape by grabbing a sword and trying to attack two guards			0
but @entity29 discovered that forensic investigations revealed @entity10 's remains , when recovered by the @entity5 , showed he had been beaten , not shot			1
the intrepid historian then found that the pilot was later buried somewhere in @entity67			0
after further research , he was told @entity10 's grave was in the @entity70			1
but his mother and father had died , and @entity29 could not find any trace of any other relatives			0
it was when their mother died in 2009 that the sisters decided to try and piece together what had happened to their uncle			0
googling his name , they were ' flabbergasted ' to see @entity29 's research on him			2
they contacted him and they made plans to visit @entity16			0
@entity29 told the @entity87 : ' instead of me tracking them down , they tracked me down			0
' i turned over a thick folder i 'd collected about him and told them that we all should someday go to @entity16			0
' the trip was put together and , through help from @entity97 ' @entity96 , they found the co-ordinates of the crash site and then discovered the wreck .			1

@entity10 first believed to have been shot dead straight away
but he was actually chained inside hut for six months before death
historian @entity29 *spent* 31 years researching the case
he then took @entity10 's three nieces to the crash site
