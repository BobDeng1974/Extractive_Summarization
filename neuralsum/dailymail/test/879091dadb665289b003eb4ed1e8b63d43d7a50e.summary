@entity1 's maligned hit man is primed to go big - game hunting again with no intention of toning down his use of legitimate force in the wake of renewed criticism			1
@entity8 arrived in @entity9 with the @entity10 , ahead of the @entity12 quarter - final against mighty @entity13 , carrying notoriety as excess baggage			1
his brutal tackle on @entity9 fly - half @entity16 at @entity18 last month , in the @entity20 finale , angered the visitors to the extent that they tried to have him banned			1
while the match officials and citing officer deemed that no action was needed , the @entity26 lock has been derided as a thug across the @entity31 and there were cries of protest in these parts , too			1
@entity26 lock @entity8 made a trademark hit on @entity9 fly - half @entity16 click here to read @entity39 's article on @entity8 ' tackle writing in these pages , @entity40 suggested that @entity8 should apologise for an offence that he argued would put parents off allowing their children to play such a brutal , damaging game			1
the comments found their target but the 26 - year - old is a laid - back character and was unfazed by the storm he had created			2
‘ i just took it on the chin and thought , “ people are going to say what they think sometimes , and sometimes people are going to view things differently ” , ’ said @entity8 as he prepared for another momentous @entity51 encounter			1
‘ obviously he has the outlet of the @entity59 to post his thoughts			2
i was n’t fussed about it but i thought i ’d send him a little tweet , just to get my own back a bit ! ’ aside from that particular outburst of condemnation , there were widespread concerns expressed about the timing and legality of his tackling style , but @entity8 is unperturbed and emphasised his largely clean disciplinary record			1
‘ to be honest , as long as it is legal and i ’m not putting my team in any jeopardy doing it , in terms of me getting booked or sent off or anything like that , i ’m going to do anything i can to help the team , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m not the sort of person who is fussed about what people think of me			2
i ’m only bothered about what i can do for my team and for myself as a player			2
coaches know how good you are , no matter what things other people are saying outside the room			2
@entity8 crumples @entity16 in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the @entity95 fly half ‘ the fact is that my record is very clean			1
i ’ve only been cited once and i ’ve never been red - carded			2
i do n’t think i ’ve had many yellows , if any , this year			2
i do n’t have a malicious streak			0
i know i ’m not a thug , i do n’t go around punching or fighting , any of that rubbish			1
‘ i just get on with the game			0
i do n’t even allow people to get me too aggravated , i just get on with my own thing			0
i ’m comfortable being who i am			0
if people want to say i ’m something else , that ’s fair enough			0
’ one of the accusations levelled at @entity8 is that he sets out to intimidate smaller opponents , notably half - backs , leading to a multitude of one - sided collisions			1
he argues that trying to unsettle and nullify these primary decision - makers is a reasonable and vital aspect of his repertoire			0
‘ if you can put pressure on the 10 , then you go out and put pressure on the 10 , and if you can do it legally then why ca n’t you do it ? ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s the way i see it			0
i ’ve got that kind of timing around the ruck and i ’ve got the speed to get to the 10			0
my size is the reason that the impact is so big , but i do n’t go looking for it			0
a livid @entity134 pushed @entity8 in the face and grapples with the @entity26 man following his challenge @entity8 and @entity138 continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over ‘ it makes a big difference to the game if you can stop the 10 from passing or stop that particular play			1
it does n’t even have to be a big hit , it just makes a difference if that 10 knows that he has pressure on him			0
‘ there is obviously a line between a legitimate and a late tackle because people get yellow - carded for late tackles			1
‘ you watch the replay of the hit on @entity16 and the other player has not caught the ball before we ’ve hit the ground			1
the fact is , had the tackle not looked as severe as it did no - one would have said anything			1
‘ the only reason is because of the impact , which looks bad because he ’s landed on his head			0
i have n’t tipped him up or anything like that — i ’ve just followed through with my tackle			1
i did n’t even know he did n’t have the ball until i looked up afterwards			0
’ 26 - year - old @entity8 passes the ball during a @entity10 training session earlier this week @entity8 has revealed that he intends to maintain his destructive style of play for @entity1 on saturday asked if he intended to resume normal , destructive service for @entity1 on saturday — in defiance of the criticism — he added : ‘ yeah , of course			1
i ’ve never done anything to get myself sent off in terms of my tackle timing or whatever , so why would i stop if it is legal ? ’ @entity1 , the champions of @entity26 , face a colossal challenge against a @entity95 club who simply do not lose at home , especially in @entity192			1
the @entity10 and three of their fellow @entity195 teams have daunting ties away from home , but captain @entity198 has hope for the quartet			0
‘ i am fully confident in ourselves , ’ @entity198 said			0
‘ i think @entity201 have a big ask in @entity202 but we saw with 14 men the other night how dangerous they can be			0
i think @entity204 against @entity205 could get a result there			0
and @entity209 v @entity208 , who knows ? i think there could be a few upsets			0

@entity8 has been derided as a thug across the channel
@entity9 tried to get him banned for brutal tackle on @entity16
@entity1 take on @entity13 in the @entity12
