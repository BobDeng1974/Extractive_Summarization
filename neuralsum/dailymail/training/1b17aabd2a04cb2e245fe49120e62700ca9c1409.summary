@entity0 is incredibly serious when it comes to his music , and even more serious when it comes to his guacamole and bananas			1
the much admired @entity7 musician made an appearance at @entity9 this week and , after getting their hands on his contract for the evening , the student newspaper decided to let the world know all of @entity0 's crazy demands and backstage needs before he gets out on stage			1
it turns out however , that @entity0 may be one of the easiest stars ever when it comes to demands , asking for little and even skipping out on alcohol all together , but stressing one thing above all - that his homemade guacamole recipe is made just how he likes it			1
that and that there be no bananas anywhere in the building			2
' they did however attach the contract , which breaks down how @entity0 's guacamole is made			1
it starts with 8 ' large , ripe @entity52 avocados ' which are cut in chunks and combined with four ' vine - ripened tomatoes ' diced , half of a chopped yellow onion , a bunch of chopped cilantro , four @entity62 peppers that are both ' de-veined and chopped ' and some salt and pepper to taste			0
this then gets gently mixed , so as not to mush up the avocados , and then covered with the avocado pits and the juice of half of a lime so the mixture does not brown			0
@entity0 suggests that it be made early , but not to early , and tossed in the refrigerator			1
the rider also states this is a ' no banana tour , ' and then adds ; ' we do n't want to see bananas anywhere in the building			2
' the @entity80 frontman ( above with @entity81 ) was upset the college published his $ 80,000 fee speaking of @entity0 , he was none too happy to have his rider go public , and a member of his team let it be known in a letter on his website			1
it said : ' the most important function of a rider is that it lays out optimal technical specifications to ensure the audience has the best experience possible			0
for that , @entity0 hires a team of very qualified touring professionals who write the rider and attempt to execute a professional and pleasant experience for all involved			0
' the letter the said ; ' part of that is making sure that the tour personnel of about 30 people plus the local venue staff are fed. contrary to what some believe , @entity0 does n’t write the rider nor make demands about his favorite snacks that must be in his dressing room			2
' most importantly however , this letter makes one thing clear above all else			0
' we recommend you try @entity116 ’s guacamole recipe , ' says the author			0

@entity0 's backstage demands for a performance at the @entity9 were published by the student newspaper
it was also made clear there should be no bananas anywhere in the building
