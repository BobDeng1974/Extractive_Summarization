when introduced to pupils as ‘ professor ’ , she may not have expected them to appreciate her academic achievements – but she did expect them to address her accordingly			0
instead , @entity5 says she was ‘ demeaned ’ by the youngsters simply calling her ‘ @entity7 ’			2
professor @entity5 described it as ‘ a depressing example of how women are given low status and men , no matter how young or new in the job they are , are given high status ’			0
infant and junior boys sitting at their desks in the 1930s , as pictured here , would not have dreamed of calling a female teacher ' sir '			0
but academics believe this is a sexist hangover from the past @entity24 : mr , @entity26 , @entity7 or ms and surname @entity29 : surname and @entity31 ( teacher ) @entity33 : monsieur or @entity35 @entity36 : @entity37 or @entity38 @entity39 : teacher , madam or sir @entity43 : surname and @entity45 ( teacher ) @entity47 : full name and @entity49 ( teacher ) @entity51 : @entity7 and name if female , or professor and name if male @entity57 : @entity7 or sir @entity59 : first name and surname @entity62 : @entity63 for women and @entity65 for men @entity67 : first names @entity69 : mr , @entity26 , @entity7 or ms and surname now the emeritus professor of @entity75 language and linguistics at @entity77 has called for the traditional titles ‘ sir ’ and ‘ @entity7 ’ to be banished from schools to stop sexist views taking root among pupils			1
her call was backed by several other academics – including one who said teachers should instead be called by their first names			1
professor @entity5 told how she had been introduced to pupils at @entity89 , where she was volunteering , as ‘ @entity90 ’ , but they soon reverted to calling her just ‘ @entity7 ’			1
‘ the men on the staff are all in their twenties and they were all called sir , ’ she said			1
‘ @entity95 is what you called the king			0
and sir is a knight			0
there were n’t women knights but @entity7 is ridiculous : it does n’t match sir at all			1
‘ it ’s just one of the names you can call an unmarried woman			2
’ she said that for both men and women using their ‘ title plus last name would be better ’			0
professor @entity5 , who taught a course for undergraduates on sexist language , warned that terms such as ‘ sir ’ and ‘ @entity7 ’ risked reinforcing the message that ‘ women are lesser beings to men ’			1
their use dates back to the 16th century , when schoolmasters were often of a lower social status than the children they taught			0
they insisted on being called ‘ sir ’ to reinforce their authority , education historian @entity126 told the @entity131			1
meanwhile women in the late @entity134 era were discouraged from working once they married , leaving schools mainly staffed by men and single women referred to as ‘ @entity7 ’			2
school girls are influenced by the ' discriminatory ' way male teachers are called ' sir ' while their female counterparts are referred to as ' @entity7 ' , according to academics @entity143 , professor of linguistics at the @entity145 , in the @entity69 , said that sir for male teachers ‘ always conveys respect ’ while @entity7 does not			1
‘ it ’s very hard to create linguistic equality between people who , in many people ’s minds , are n’t equal , ’ she said			0
‘ at school , we have children who are still really only learning language			0
they pick up on it very readily and then the next generation gets exposed to the prejudices of the previous generation			1
’ professor @entity162 , from @entity163 , urged schools to abandon titles altogether and allow pupils to use first names			2
but @entity168 , chief executive of the @entity169 , which runs three schools in the @entity171 , said : ‘ if i ’m in a school where students do n’t know me and they call me “ @entity7 ” , i ’m fine with that			2
they ’re showing respect by giving me a title rather than “ hey ” or “ oi , you ” or whatever			0

' @entity7 ' exposes pupils to ' prejudices of previous generation ' , say professors
instead all teachers should be called ' sir ' or their first names
call likely to be ignored by traditionalist education *secretary* @entity191
