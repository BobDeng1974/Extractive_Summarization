by @entity0 @entity1 has released a stunning new panorama that shows the cosmos at its most colorful			1
the incredible image was captured by the @entity5 and , for the first time , includes ultraviolet light , which is normally not visible to the human eye			1
it shows up in the photo as bright baby blue with spinning galaxies , which are about five to 10 billion years old , not too old or young in cosmic terms			1
the @entity5 team have unveiled the most colorful view of universe yet after it was captured by the space telescope the photo - made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time - shows about 10,000 multi-colored galaxies , extending back in time to within a few hundred million years of the big bang			1
@entity5 astronomer @entity23 said by adding ultraviolet and infrared to the pictures , people can now see the universe in the broad spectrum of color ' and then some			0
' astronomers previously studied the @entity31 in visible and near - infrared light in a series of images captured from 2003 to 2009			0
but using ultraviolet light , astronomers have combined the full range of colors available to @entity5 , stretching all the way from ultraviolet to near - infrared light			2
principal investigator @entity42 of @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , said : ' the lack of information from ultraviolet light made studying galaxies in the @entity31 like trying to understand the history of families without knowing about the grade - school children			1
' the addition of the ultraviolet fills in this missing range			0
' the @entity5 is seen in this picture taken from a space shuttle the @entity5 was carried into orbit by a @entity59 in 1990 @entity5 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared its orbit outside the distortion of @entity66 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high - resolution images with almost no background light @entity5 's @entity31 has recorded some of the most detailed visible - light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time the telescope is one of @entity1 's @entity75 , along with the @entity76 , the @entity77 and the @entity78 @entity5 is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts its scientific successor , the @entity82 is currently scheduled to be launched by @entity1 in 2018			1
ultraviolet light comes from the hottest , largest , and youngest stars			2
by observing at these wavelengths , researchers get a direct look at which galaxies are forming stars and where the stars are forming within those galaxies			0
studying the ultraviolet images of galaxies in this intermediate time period enables astronomers to understand how galaxies grew in size by forming small collections of very hot stars			0
because @entity66 's atmosphere filters most ultraviolet light , this work can only be accomplished with a space - based telescope			2
' ultraviolet surveys like this one using the unique capability of @entity5 are incredibly important in planning for @entity1 's @entity82 , ' said team member @entity107 of @entity108 in @entity109			2
' @entity5 provides an invaluable ultraviolet - light dataset that researchers will need to combine with infrared data from @entity113			0
' this is the first really deep ultraviolet image to show the power of that combination			0

stunning image was captured using , for the first time , ultraviolet light
it shows around galaxies ranging from 5 billion to 10 billion years old
@entity1 's photo was made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time
