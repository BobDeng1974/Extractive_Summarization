such surreal scenarios are commonplace in the world of little people captured by artist and ' macro photographer ' @entity13 who specialises in extreme close - up photography			1
the @entity16 - based finance worker , 34 , spends hours scouring the internet to source his figurines , which are mainly intended for use on model railway sets			1
artist @entity13 's little people try to crack eggs in his art work called @entity24 a little person tries to open a cold drink can of fizzy drink in his art work , @entity27 ( l ) and a couple make their way through a landscape filled with shells in his work , walking on eggshells ( r ) ' the little people fascinate me , ' he said			1
' i enjoy finding new figures frozen in a particular pose - it almost feels like i have to then find a task for them to complete or be involved in , helping them fulfil their purpose			2
' more often than not , i place the figures inside scenarios where they have a gargantuan task to complete which sometimes invokes a sense of sympathy inside me for them			0
' i guess i am a hard taskmaster			0
' each image takes around an hour and a half to pose and shoot , and the @entity52 artist says he is constantly on the hunt for new scenes			0
' it is actually quite tricky to make the scenario feel convincing , and so a lot of thought goes into the placement of the figures and the props , and the nature of the scenario itself , ' @entity13 said			1
' normally i will try to create something that involves an element of humour			2
' a man tries to crack open a nut in the art work there 's always one pistachio that is always near impossible to open a tiny workman scoops out some kiwi ( l ) while another little man prepares to go for a swim in a bowl of cereal in his piece titled , water wings ( r ) @entity13 's little people prepare a pumpkin in his art work , @entity86 @entity13 began producing the latest little people series at the tail end of 2011 , using a dslr camera and a macro lens			1
however , the artist has used figurines in his photography as far back as 1999 , during his @entity95 degree at the @entity96 , where he was inspired by photographers like @entity99 artist @entity98			1
' i always joke with people , saying that i obtained my degree by playing with toys , which on the face of it , is difficult to argue against , ' the artist said			0
one of artist @entity13 's little businessmen stands inside a pea pod , in his art work welcome to the @entity110 little forensic scientists observe a pair of candy teeth in his art work titled scale and @entity116 ( l ) and comedy jaws feature in @entity118 , judging by the size of these dentures , i 'd say we are looking for @entity122 little men stuck in the @entity4 drink spilled on the floor in his art work titled , @entity127 ' i am a very keen landscape photographer , and i think my initial interest was born out of an effort to find a completely different style of photography to interest myself in			1
' table - top photography could not be more different to landscape photography			1
' instead of attempting to capture a vast expansive landscape using a wide - angle lens , i am instead trying to capture a miniature scene using a macro lens			2
' the series has proved a big hit online , with the artist running regular competitions on his @entity143 site asking viewers to come up with slogans to accompany each shot			0
each work in the series is temporary , with individual little people often getting the chance to star in more than one scene			0
little people seen working in the paddy fields in his piece @entity156 little security personnel stand guard in front of giant cockroaches in his art work , @entity163 ! ( l ) and people seen shovelling sugar in his piece @entity168 ( r ) a group of little characters seen relaxing on multi-coloured ' furniture ' in his art work @entity172 ' i will normally find multiple uses for each figurine which i think the little people are quite happy about - they would get pretty bored otherwise , ' @entity13 said			1
' i have quite a few ideas stored up			0
whenever a good idea enters my head , i try to write it down as it is so easy to forget them			0
' the longer i spend creating these miniature dioramas , the better i think i get at it			0
' because the figurines are so small , setting them up is an incredibly delicate operation , especially if i am using multiple figures that are in close proximity to each other			1
' so here 's hoping i am getting closer to creating that ultimate mock - up			2
' little people seen working on potato chip sticks , in his art work titled ever wondered why all the crisps at @entity198 ? tiny workmen grate hunks of cheese in @entity13 's art work , you 're doing a @entity204 ( l ) a skier hits the slopes in @entity207 runners pound across bubble wrap in @entity210 to the shops ' i take a lot of enjoyment from seeing the final shot , which normally results in a lot of laughter , ' he said			1
' i like the idea of using these miniature people to depict more serious issues that reflect current and contemporary problems around the world			0
' i tend to receive an amused reaction from most people , ' he added			0
' that is to be expected though as most of the images do convey some element of comedy			0
' tiny workmen are seen carrying breath mints in @entity230 a couple take a walk next to two jelly babies in his piece , taking the babies for a walk and checking pregnancy status in his piece titled that 's gon na be a big baby ! little people seen destroying sweet treats in a work entitled @entity246 ? men in hazardous materials suits observe a giant chilli pepper in his work , warning - @entity252 ! little dancers in his art work titled , @entity256 people hard at work extracting the kernels from the cob in harvesting the corn			2
