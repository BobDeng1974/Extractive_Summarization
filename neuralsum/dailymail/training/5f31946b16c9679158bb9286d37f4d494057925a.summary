by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 07:02 est , 4 october 2012 call the doctor ! a new smartphone app checks moles for signs of melanoma most people with moles know they should check them regularly for signs of skin cancer , but how many of us actually know what we 're looking for ? at the tap of a screen , a new smartphone app can help identify if a little blemish might turn into a big problem			1
' @entity18 ' uses augmented reality technology to check moles for irregularities in size , shape , colour and border			1
after taking a picture of a mole , the user is presented with a colour - coded ' risk ' level for each of these characteristics			0
the app can archive and compare data to check for any changes in a mole			1
it will also remind the user when it 's time to check a mole again			1
changes in moles are a common sign of malignant melanoma , one of the three main types of skin cancer			1
melanoma can also develop in normal - looking skin			2
although less common than basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma , malignant melanoma causes the majority of deaths from skin cancer			1
it is mainly caused by exposure to uv rays			0
@entity56 , the developer of @entity18 , lives in @entity57 , which has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world			1
having lived in @entity61 for 26 years before moving to @entity57 , he 's experienced the danger of having fair skin in a hot climate			1
@entity56 told @entity65 : ' i have already had 3 basal cell carcinomas removed from my neck , face and back , and at my age this is very rare			0
so i have pretty much seen first hand the dangers of the sun. that 's where the idea for @entity18 came from			0
' i do n't have a background in medicine , but when i found my first cancer a few years back i pretty much read everything about it and had a solid understanding of what to look for			2
then it was just a simple case of combining the knowledge i had gained with my software development skills , and @entity86 was created			0
in the @entity112 , more than 10,600 people are diagnosed with melanoma each year			0
it is more common in women , who are most likely to develop it on the legs			0
in men , the danger areas are the chest and back			0
more than 2 million @entity121 are diagnosed with skin cancer each year , and some 50,000 will be diagnosed with melanoma			1
melanoma is especially dangerous if it is not found early			0
regular skin checks can help people discover melanoma in its earliest stages , doctors agree			2
@entity56 hopes his app will help teach users how to check themselves , rather than just doing it for them			1
' i could have just written an app that snaps a photo and spits out an answer , but i chose to make it as transparent as possible and try educate the user			2
so by doing it using the real time computer vision , the user can see immediately what sorts of things the app is monitoring ... it makes it fun for the user and i think a lot easier to teach the user what sorts of things to look for			2
' having fair skin means you might be more susceptible to melanoma , as does a family history of cancerous moles you should seek medical advice if your mole ... visit the @entity157 website for more information doctor @entity18 is n't the first tool to help smartphone users check for signs of skin cancer			1
other apps guide users through self exams , and the @entity167 - made ' @entity166 ' converts an iphone into a dermatoscope , which doctors use to look for melanoma			0
but at £ 995 , the @entity166 is in a different league to @entity18 , available from @entity174 's appstore for £ 2.49			0
@entity56 stresses that his app is not , and will never be a substitute for a real doctor , even though he says quite a few doctors have told him they are using it with their patients			0
' there are a lot of factors that can influence the image processing , such as shadows , poor lighting and poor camera quality , so i do n't think any app could claim that they can spot a cancer 100 % .			2

smartphone app uses ' augmented reality ' to check moles for irregularities
can archive and compare data to check for changes over time
developed in @entity57 , which has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world
