@entity3 , who cooks his own meals every day , told @entity46 : my mum is amazing , she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always			1
' to spoil my mum i would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it , fish based maybe			1
' @entity55 loves nice salads and especially avocado , so would definitely include that			0
' for the challenge the @entity42 ambassador had to prepare quinoa - which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with @entity11 's home - made spicy ' @entity65 ' sauce , made to a secret family recipe			1
the pair cook together when they can although these days it 's becoming rarer			1
@entity11 said to @entity46 : ' when we can we like to cook together , but it does n't happen so often these days , as @entity3 lives away from home			1

does he still have the same tastes ? yes still loves it , amongst other things ! but @entity3 loves anything with spice to it			0
what is his favourite food ? i would say he has two favourite dishes , fish and chicken			1
the white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes , which is why he loves our family 's @entity116 sauce			2
if he was cooking for you , what would he cook ? probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven			2
it 's quite an easy dish to make and it 's really tasty			2
he would probably make a side salad with rocket , tomatoes and lots of avocado , he knows i love avocado ! what does @entity3 mean to you ? all of the family are so proud of what @entity3 has achieved so far , he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream , as parents you could n't wish for more than that for your children ! but she still tries to get her family together at weekends			0
' every sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical @entity150 lunch of spicy meat , rice and peas			0
' we love getting together and think it 's important to spend that time together , ' she continued			0
famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches , @entity3 now incorporates as much nutrient - packed foods into his diet as he can			2
' it 's important for me to make sure that i eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously i 'm training every day , ' he said			0
' i do enjoy cooking and i look forward to my dinner each night			0
' his favourite meal to cook is ' salmon , kale , sweet potato , broccoli and quinoa ' which he covers in @entity116 sauce			1
' i have it on everything , ' he said			0
' it adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish ; i even took some out to the @entity184 with me			2
' a typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein - rich foods ' lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa , with perhaps chicken or fish [ as ] they are both great for recovery and full of protein , ' he said			1
' on the side i would have broccoli , spinach , lots of steamed veg			0
i also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day , ' he continued			0
so far so healthy , but does n't he have any guilty food secrets ? ' i 'm pretty good with my diet to be honest , i love healthy food which helps and it is something i have worked on for years			0
but every now and then you need something sweet , which is fine , but all in moderation , ' he said			0
and does he dance in the kitchen when he 's successfully cooked a meal ? ' haha i leave the dancing for on the pitch , ' he laughed			2
