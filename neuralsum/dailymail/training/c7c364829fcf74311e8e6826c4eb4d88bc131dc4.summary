by @entity1 reporter published : 09:30 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 9 december 2013 only one third of teenage girls in the @entity5 have received all three doses of the hpv vaccine - and few people understand its effectiveness against cancer , a new study has found			1
data from the @entity12 from 2012 to 2013 showed that 1,417 people were ' vaccine relevant ' - but just 33 per cent of teen girls had received all three doses			1
and even fewer boys - around 5 percent - have gotten vaccinated against the human papillomavirus , a virus which can cause cervical , anal and vulvar cancers , the study found			1
vaccine : a study has found that a third of teen girls have failed to have the full hpv vaccine			1
the injections against @entity29 are given to prevent a sexually transmitted infection that can cause cancer the study , which was presented at a meeting of the @entity34 on saturday , also found that black , @entity36 and low - income women were less likely to have received it			1
the @entity38 recommends boys and girls aged 11 and 12 get the vaccine			0
in addition , women up to 26 and men up to 21 who did not receive the vaccine earlier in life are recommended to receive it			0
this puts the ' vaccine relevant ' group between the ages of nine and 27			2
but the target group is also largely unaware of its effectiveness , the study round			2
of the 3,551 adults who were part of the survey , 70 per cent said they were unsure of how well the vaccine prevented cervical cancer and only 25 per cent said they 'd talked to a health care provider about the vaccine			1
' although human papilloma virus ( @entity29 ) vaccination has been available for seven years , uptake remains low , and evidence suggests disparities exist in vaccination completion , ' said the authors of this study led by @entity70 , phd , @entity71			1
protection : the study also found that 70 per cent of people were unsure how effective the vaccine was @entity29 - or the human papillomavirus - is the most common sexually transmitted infection , according to the @entity38			1
anyone who has ever had sex can get the virus and it 's so common that nearly all sexually - active men and women get it at some point in their lives			0
it can be passed through sex and oral sex , as well as genital contact , and most people do not even realize they have it			2
there are many different types of @entity29 and while most infections go away without issue , some can lead to serious problems such as genital warts or cervical cancer			1
there is no certain way to tell who will develop health problems from hpv and who will not			0
around 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed every year , with about 4,000 deaths , according to the @entity108			2
pre-teens , teenagers and young people can receive @entity112 and @entity113 , which protect against cervical cancer			1
@entity113 also protects against genital warts and anal , vaginal and vulval cancers			1
' perceptions about the hpv vaccine may be contributing to these trends			0
' this uncertainty may influence decision - making about getting vaccinated , and it hinders our ability to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality and reduce disparities in cervical cancer			0
' researchers added that @entity131 black respondents were the least likely to have confidence in the vaccine 's effectiveness - just only 18.6 per cent said they had confidence in it			1
in addition , the chances of discussing the injection with a healthcare provider varied depending on education level ; 34 per cent of college graduates said they talked to a provider about the vaccine , compared to 21 per cent of those with less than a high school education			2
the study added : ' findings suggest hpv communication and messages need refinement to clearly highlight vaccine efficacy , and targeted strategies may be needed to reach @entity154 and individuals with lower levels of education			2
' girls can receive either @entity112 or @entity113 , while boys only receive @entity113			0
for its effectiveness , three doses are administered			0
the three - shot series costs around $ 400 and insurance plans typically cover them , according the @entity38			0
