so , here we are in @entity1 for the final round of this season ’s championship and it is an extremely exciting moment for my career			1
i am fighting for the @entity8 at the last race , i have a good chance to win , and this is what i have been working towards for all of the years since i began my racing life as a small child			1
fortunately , it does n’t feel as though it is the ultimate moment of my lifetime so far , which is good			2
instead it feels like just another race			2
of course , it will be very intense but i have a fantastic opportunity to win and i am raring to go			0
@entity23 - 334 points 2			1
@entity20 - 317 points @entity23 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity21 , even if @entity20 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity23 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
in terms of preparing for this deciding race , i have done all i possibly can			2
i went to the @entity29 factory last friday and practised driving the @entity47 on the simulator			1
i also debriefed with my engineers to learn as much as i could from the last race in @entity51			1
qualifying has obviously been a strong suit for me this year but i have had to work on my racing , and i was delighted that in @entity55 i took a huge step forward			0
i dominated the entire weekend			0
i was fastest in every practice session , secured pole and then won the race ahead of my team - mate @entity23 which leaves me 17 points behind him in the race for the championship			1
i know that i must carry that form through to this weekend 's race in @entity1			1
it goes without saying that i need some help from @entity23 to clinch the title , and i am going to try and put as much pressure on him as i can			1
he has been making some mistakes recently , he spun in @entity51 for instance , so maybe there is a chance that he will help me out and that is what i am looking for			1
i am going to try to push him as hard as i can to get him to make a mistake			1
it was a massive challenge for me to have @entity23 stuck to my gearbox for the entire race in @entity51			1
i could n’t afford to make a single error so i tried to control the pace of the race , not go to my absolute limit to avoid mistakes , but at the same time i needed to be quick enough so he could not overtake			1
i really found that balance in @entity55 and i was extremely happy about that because i did n’t manage to do it at the previous race in @entity89			2
but now we are in @entity1 and i am looking forward to the weekend			0
my wife @entity91 is here to support me which is great and i have some friends coming along , too so it is going to be very nice to have all their backing			2
i had team - mate @entity23 on my gearbox throughout the race in @entity51 but held him off to secure a win it was great to be back on the top step of the podium last time out at the @entity51 @entity21 what has been very special is the amount of support i have received via text messages and on social media			1
the support has been so huge which i am using as a motivational tool			2
it comes from everywhere around the world , including @entity111 , and it is fantastic and it makes me very , very happy so i want to thank everyone for that			0
i would also like to pay tribute to my team			2
for the whole year they have allowed @entity23 and i to fight it out which is great and probably not necessarily what everyone expected			1
we have both enjoyed a proper battle on the track and hopefully created some memorable moments for the fans – that is what is important for our sport			0
as a team we have been so dominant this season so it has been important for both @entity23 and i to do the business on track and up until now it has worked out really well			1
let ’s hope we have a good final race			0
here i am on the red carpet with my wife @entity91 , and later on in the evening after receiving my @entity140 award in my opinion @entity141 ( centre ) is one of the world 's best pianists			0
he loves his motor racing , too @entity147 is a legend for @entity148 and it was a privilege to meet him at the awards ceremony earlier this week , i received a @entity148 oscar , also known as a @entity140 award , for the best athlete and for my sporting achievements in @entity148 this year			0
it was a really proud moment			0
i took to the stage just after the national team who won the @entity159 earlier this year and it was an awesome feeling			0
i met @entity147 and @entity161 , who are both a great inspiration for me			0
@entity163 were there and the best pianist in the world @entity141 , too , both with great performances			0
they were incredibly passionate and @entity141 is really in to his motor racing			0
after so many years of performing at the highest level they were still incredibly in to what they do and i am able to take and learn a lot from that			0
finally , i would like to thank @entity176 for allowing me to write a column this year and also a special thanks to all the readers who have been with us throughout the season			0
i hope you ’ve had as much fun reading it as i have writing it			0
i also hope that the money we have been able to donate to the @entity184 will help the families of those people who have made such a great contribution to our sport over so many years			0
@entity191 previews @entity8 season finale @entity20 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity195 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity8 mechanics and their families , putting @entity8 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			2
you can follow @entity20 on @entity207 @ nico_rosberg and @entity29 @ @entity208			2

i am 17 points behind @entity29 team - mate @entity23 with one race left
this is an exciting moment for me **...** it is what i have been working towards
@entity23 spun in @entity51 and has been making some mistakes recently
so hopefully he will help me out **...** i am going to push him as hard as i can
i want to thank the fans for their support this season , it 's been incredible
