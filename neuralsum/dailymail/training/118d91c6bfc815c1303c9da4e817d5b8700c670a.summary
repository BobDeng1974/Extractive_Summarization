by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is famous for inventing the first cyclone vacuum cleaner as well as a bladeless fan and super-fast hand drier			1
and now the @entity7 appliance firm has taken to @entity8 to tease a new mystery device			2
the video shows various ground - level moving robots and engineers tinkering with parts – leading many to speculate that a robotic @entity15 - like hoover is on the horizon			1
is this the vacuum cleaner of the future ? @entity2 has released a video to tease a new product ( a still is pictured ) but has n't revealed what it is			1
the @entity7 applicance firm merely said : ‘ 16 years			0
the result ? tell us what you think it is ’ whatever the product may be , the firm has spent a lot of time and money working on it			0
the only snippet of information to accompany the mysterious video , reads : ‘ 16 years			0
the result ? tell us what you think it is			0
’ the device is due to be unveiled on september 4			1
speculating about the upcoming product , one viewer of the video wrote on @entity2 ’s @entity8 page : ‘ in this video it looks like lots of different tests of locomotion			1
there is one with tracks , and one that sort of looks like it is gliding like a hovercraft			0
’ a few seconds in the video ( screen grab pictured ) appear to show a machine that looks like it has three cloths attached to it - adding weight to predictions that ' @entity66 ' will be an autonomous cleaning device look out ! it appears that the device includes a camera with a panoramic view and could include caterpillar tracks			2
this device could be a camera mounted in a mast the video shows glimpses of what could be cloths or brushes attached to the base of a robot			1
it also shows a camera on a mast with a panoramic view			2
@entity2 has previously said that a robotic cleaner would navigate using cameras			2
the company invested £ 5 million ( $ 8.2 million ) in a lab at @entity89 designed to help robots ‘ understand and adapt to the world around them , ’ earlier this year			0
@entity2 created a prototype robotic cleaner in 2001 – but it was too heavy and expensive to put into production			2
many people associate the @entity2 brand with vacuum cleaners , despite it producing other devices such as fans and driers			2
another said : ‘ the robot vacuum			0
i 've heard many rumours about @entity2 working on this technology			0
whatever it is , i know it will be perfectly engineered			0
’ it appears that the device includes a camera with a panoramic view and could include caterpillar tracks			0
another few seconds in the video appear to show a machine that looks like it has three cloths attached to it – adding weight to predictions that ' @entity66 ' will be an autonomous cleaning device			0
if the product is a robotic vacuum cleaner , it will enter a market currently dominated by @entity15 , which makes circular autonomous cleaners			1
earlier this year , @entity2 invested £ 5 million ( $ 8.2 million ) in a lab at @entity89 designed to help robots ‘ understand and adapt to the world around them , ’ the @entity130 reported , leading may people to speculate that a new robotic product would be coming soon			1
in an interview in february , company founder sir @entity2 suggested a robotic cleaner might be in the pipeline and would use computer vision to navigate a room			2
@entity2 created a robotic vacuum cleaner prototype device in 2001 but it was too heavy and expensive to put into production			1
doing the locomotion : speculating about the upcoming product , one viewer of the video wrote on @entity2 's @entity8 page : ' in this video it looks like lots of different tests of locomotion			1
there is one with tracks , and one that sort of looks like it is gliding like a hovercraft ( pictured )			0
' no more chores : if @entity2 's product is a robotic vacuum cleaner , it will enter a market currently dominated by @entity15 , which makes circular autonomous cleaners			1
this i - robot @entity164 model costs £ 360 @entity2 created a robotic vacuum cleaner prototype device in 2001 but it was too heavy and expensive to put into production			1
the company is perhaps best known for its cyclone vacuum cleaners , which unlike previous types do not have filters , as shown in this diagram			0

@entity2 posted a teaser video on @entity8 to talk about its new device
most experts speculate it could be a robotic vacuum cleaner
video shows different robots moving and a panoramic camera on a mast
mysterious product will be unveiled on september 4
