@entity0 went on the defensive , which is more than could be said for his team on tuesday night			2
or this season , for that matter			2
that ’s 17 goals shipped in this convoluted calendar of @entity8 and domestic football			2
and a first defeat to @entity13 in 21 fixtures , the product of a game skewed almost entirely in favour of the side @entity0 used to manage			1
not that he was in the mood to enter into a conversation about numbers			0
‘ last year was the club ’s record points tally in the @entity22 so we can share statistics all you want , ’ he said			0
the look on his face suggested it was n’t a sincere invitation			2
@entity29 shoots to score past @entity31 goalkeeper @entity30 to give @entity13 the lead on tuesday night @entity29 is congratulated by his @entity13 team - mates after putting the @entity35 side ahead against the @entity31 @entity36 clenches his fist in celebration after sliding in to double @entity13 's advantage over @entity31 @entity41 @entity40 is congratulated by @entity42 after scoring @entity13 's third goal of the night @entity13 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 5.5 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 5.5 ; @entity49 6 ( @entity50 70 , 6 ) , @entity42 7 ; @entity36 7 ( @entity51 85 ) , @entity29 7 ( @entity52 68 , 6 ) , @entity53 8 ; @entity54 6			1

@entity31 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity30 5.5 ; @entity60 4.5 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 5.5 , @entity63 6.5 ; @entity64 6 ( @entity65 58 , 6 ) , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6.5 ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 5 ( @entity70 46 , 6 ) , @entity71 6 ( @entity72 81 ) subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			1
referee : @entity79 6 att : 20,397 @entity80 : @entity53 these are trying times for the likeable man at @entity31 ’s helm			1
they sit 14th in the @entity22 , having been beaten 3 - 2 on their own turf by @entity88 at the weekend			2
that situation , coupled with the demands and consequences of the @entity8 , which @entity13 know only too well , necessitated the seven changes @entity0 made to his line - up			1
less understandable was @entity0 ’s view of the result , which he said included ‘ several positives ’			0
among them , he said @entity60 , playing his first game in seven months , looked ‘ sharp ’			0
without labouring a cruel point , the 33 - year - old was ripped to shreds by @entity53 , @entity13 ’s rapid left winger			1
as @entity13 manager @entity107 said : ‘ @entity53 was a very good threat in one versus one situations - it was something we targeted when we saw the team - sheets			1
’ it was @entity53 who made the first - half opener for @entity29 , before @entity36 capitalised on some farcical defending after the break and @entity30 was too easily beaten by @entity40 ’s late strike			1
‘ it is something we need to address , ’ @entity0 said in reference to @entity31 ’s defending , though he later denied @entity30 ’s confidence is becoming an issue			1
@entity31 wideman @entity64 made his long - awaited return to the @entity31 ' first - team following injury @entity31 frontman @entity69 takes aim as @entity13 midfielder @entity49 ( centre ) watches on @entity13 midfielder @entity42 shields the ball away from @entity31 summer signing @entity127 ( right ) ‘ certain individuals were very pleasing , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ the night was very positive in some aspects and very disappointing in the result			0
‘ it was typical cup football once we lost the goal			0
the scoreline reflects that @entity13 were clinical in front of goal and we were n’t			1
’ but in reality , that was generous to @entity31 and harsh on @entity13 , whose rookie manager @entity107 freely admits to calling his old boss for advice			1
‘ it was a good night , ’ @entity107 said			0
‘ three goals and a clean sheet – i could n’t have asked for more			2
i thought we played well against a very good side			0
they came here with a full squad			0
‘ this competition is very important to the team , the crowd and the club			0
’ indeed , a replica of the trophy they won sits in the foyer of this stadium , but @entity162 ’s selection hinted that the @entity22 remains an inhibiting concern , with five changes to the side that lost here against @entity167 on saturday			2
initially , that looked a gamble			0
@entity31 ’s @entity64 , playing his first game since a horrible double fracture of his left leg in january , won an early free - kick that could , with luck , have proved decisive			1
@entity63 took the kick and @entity61 shook off @entity47 a little too easily			0
it left @entity61 five yards from goal with a free swing , but stand - in goalkeeper @entity44 managed to block			2
@entity60 had earlier wasted a golden chance after more lax @entity13 defending , slicing over from inside the area			1
sadly for @entity60 , that was the highlight			0
he was equalling @entity31 ’s club record for an outfield player by appearing in his 15th season , but he was shown up by @entity53 in the moments immediately preceding @entity29 ’s 29th - minute opener			1
the @entity190 left winger went outside and then in before squaring across the six - yard box for @entity29 , who finished at the far post			1
@entity29 was on the pitch for less than an hour against @entity167 , when @entity194 saw one of his lesser displays , so this was a fine response			1
@entity53 looks a potential snip at £ 4m			0
@entity31 wideman @entity68 passes the ball under pressure from @entity36 @entity202 looks back having been dispossessed by @entity31 midfielder @entity66 @entity13 striker @entity203 watched the game from the stands @entity31 responded by bring @entity70 on at half - time for @entity69 and within a minute he had found space and rocketed a shot marginally over the bar			1
that was as close as @entity31 came and they were two down after 64 minutes			1
@entity49 played in @entity42 , who hit a hopeful cross into the area			0
under little pressure , @entity62 misread the bounce and headed against his own bar			0
@entity36 buried the rebound from close range			1
‘ the second goal was a bad decision , if you want , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ luck plays a part - it bounces to the striker			2
’ @entity40 wrapped it up after 87 minutes , his low shot going past @entity30 without much bother			2
‘ we kept 15 clean sheets last season , ’ @entity0 added			0

@entity13 beat @entity31 for first - time ever to *progress* in @entity234
goals from @entity29 , @entity36 and @entity40 seal *victory*
@entity31 next face @entity239 rivals @entity241 on saturday at @entity242
