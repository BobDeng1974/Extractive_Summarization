until very recently , tv chef @entity0 refused to delve too deeply into her complicated past			1
when you look at the bare facts of her early life – given up by her birth mother as a baby , fostered , then adopted , then ricocheted back into the foster system , all by the time she was eight – you can understand why			1
since she burst into public consciousness , first as a model then as a potential successor to @entity14 , @entity13 ( herself the mother of a 17 - year - old daughter ) has answered questions about her childhood honestly but with a degree of vagueness			1
she admits she did n't know half the story herself			1
there was , she says , an unwillingness to ' take a brick out , in case the whole wall falls down '			1
it 's an astonishing programme , but a harrowing one for the viewer , never mind for @entity13			1
' i thought i knew my own story , ' she admits			1
' but i underestimated how difficult it would be			1
' what she uncovers is the stuff of nightmares			1
the biggest question had always been why her adoptive parents , @entity53 and @entity54 , had actually allowed her to go back into foster care			1
@entity13 discovers , via social workers ' records , it was because when the @entity60 ' marriage broke up ( @entity13 was three at the time ) , @entity53 began drinking heavily			1
@entity13 became the subject of her rages – to the point where she was placed on the at - risk register			1
in the programme @entity13 , 41 , reads reports of how her mother had physically attacked her and even fantasised about throwing @entity13 under a lorry			1
the first reports are dated 1976			1
by 1981 her records state , ' the mother was in an agitated state and demanded we take her daughter into care as she could not stand her any longer			1
she said she dreaded the school holidays and was sure she would do @entity13 some damage			1
@entity13 holds a photograph of herself as an 18 - month old ' she said she had already tried to strangle her and suffocate her , and had hit her before she went to school this morning			1
she said the only way she could keep from hitting @entity13 was to keep her locked in her bedroom			1
' while @entity13 remembers things being very wrong at home , she did not have any inkling of this			1
' i always got the feeling i did n't belong , that i was in the wrong place , tip - toeing around , trying to be as quiet as i could be , not feeling good enough , ' is how she puts it			1
' but that was devastating to read			1
' for most of the programme she 's remarkably composed , but here she cracks and has to leave the room			1
later , she explains , ' i was reading it as if it was someone else			2
i do n't want to sound " poor me " , but it 's not nice			2
' @entity100 , @entity13 's adoptive mother admitted trying to strangle and suffocate @entity13 @entity13 's story starts in november 1972 when she was born in @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105			1
there had never been any question of her birth mother – who was unmarried – keeping her			2
it was a place , she explains , for ' destitute mothers , which she thought she was '			2
as soon as she was born she was placed into the care of a couple called @entity115 and @entity116 – their first foster child			2
she only tracked them down after a radio appeal asking listeners if they remembered a white couple in @entity123 caring for a black baby			2
@entity13 lived with them happily for 18 months , along with another little girl			2
she was , she learns from @entity115 , ' a chunky little child ' but an adorable one			2
there was talk , she learns , of the home becoming a permanent one			2
' i wanted to adopt you , ' says @entity115 , starting to cry			2
' but we had only signed up to be temporary foster carers			2
and by then i was pregnant myself			2
' @entity115 and @entity116 met @entity53 and @entity54 , the then prospective adoptive parents			1
' they were smitten with you , ' says @entity115			2
' and they were middle class			2
we thought you 'd get a good education with them			0
but handing you over was the most difficult thing i 've had to do			0
' @entity149 was adopted as a baby and later went into foster care by rights , the rest of her life should have been more settled			0
in reality , it was anything but			0
her relationship with her adoptive parents at their @entity162 home has always sounded warm and supportive ( they have featured in her cookery programmes ) , but the reality was much more complex			1
@entity53 now has dementia so is not a part of the programme , but @entity54 is			0
@entity13 confronts him , gently , about his memories of what happened			0
after he and @entity53 split he lived apart from the family – in a boat , it seems – and has scant knowledge of what his daughter was going through			0
' i was n't aware what was going on , ' he says			0
even when the idea of @entity13 going back into care was raised by the social workers ? ' i was the obvious alternative , but i was living in a one - berth boat			0
' he wonders if he could have done more			0
his daughter does n't reply			0
@entity13 retraces some of her old , temporary homes , and has to steel herself for a meeting with @entity187 and @entity188 and their daughter @entity189 – ' the only foster carers i was anxious about '			0
@entity13 had lived with them for six months , and not happily			0
former missionaries , it is suggested that they were paired with @entity13 simply because they had some experience of black people			0
@entity13 was , by then , an angry child – resentful of having to go to church , and desperate to go home to her mother @entity53			0
they recall happy times , she less so			0
' they 're friendly people , ' she says			0
' they had a home and i needed a home			0
what was the problem ? it would probably be different now because there 's all sorts of training			0
' outwardly , @entity13 triumphed			0
after her spell in emergency foster care she went back to her mother , although the subsequent years were not easy			0
she 's said in the past that her difficult upbringing made her determined and self - sufficient			1
but she does open up here about the difficult years in between			0
speaking to one troubled teen she says she recognises the mix of ' toughness and vulnerability ' youngsters in care show , saying she got involved with a gang who were drinking and stealing			0
' i was on the fringes of that , ' she says			0
' i could have gone down a dark route			0
' that she did n't seems all the more remarkable as the credits roll on her extraordinary story , which she sums up as ' enlightening and daunting and sad '			0
there are no regrets , however , that she went looking for the truth			1
' i 'm lucky to have such a history written in black and white , ' she says , in reference to her social work records			0
it 's a sober reminder of how even difficult answers about who you are can be better than none at all			0
