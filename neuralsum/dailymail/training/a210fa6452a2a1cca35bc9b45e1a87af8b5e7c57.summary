with everything from lions to popular superheroes on display , creative pet grooming is proof that art is n't limited to a canvas and paint			1
or so @entity7 , the @entity9 's top dog coiffeur , will tell you			1
a @entity12 mother - of - four , mrs @entity7 has won every competition the @entity9 has to offer - with a little help from her pet poodle , @entity16			1
now a new @entity18 documentary takes you behind the scenes as she battles it out against top groomers from around the globe at the world 's biggest dog grooming event in @entity25 , @entity26			1
' if you 're going to do creative grooming , being the @entity9 champion is really nice , really sweet , but it 's not really much of a challenge , ' explains mrs @entity7			1
' i want to be the best - to be up with the best			0
' and the competition is fierce			0
in the @entity38 , dog grooming is a multi-billion dollar industry and winning at @entity25 can transform a business			1
for @entity51 , a champion dog groomer and the owner of a canine condo in @entity55 , @entity56 , the rewards are obvious			1
' people spend more money on their pets than they do on their children around here , ' she explains , while pointing out some of the more unusual features of her deluxe dog hotel			1
literary inspiration : @entity7 's @entity68 look included a bonsai tree tail , a waterfall and an orange fish competition : @entity7 went up against @entity38 groomers ( @entity74 ) @entity75 , @entity51 and @entity76 ' we 've got flat screen tvs , ceiling fans ... there 's furniture for the dogs and people can choose the channel for their dogs to watch			1
a lot of people request sports but some like the @entity90			0
' like @entity91 , @entity51 is also planning to compete at @entity25 and has dreamed up a @entity93 themed design for her dogs , @entity95 and @entity96			2
' i reckon you could compare this to someone who sculpts things out of wood or concrete , ' she adds of her passion for extreme dog styling			2
' @entity106 used a white blank piece of paper , i use a white dog			2
' in @entity25 , mrs @entity7 and @entity16 have arrived after an eight hour flight from @entity112 , but they ca n't go to bed - there 's still hours of preparation required before the poodle can appear in front of the judges			2
to win the @entity118 , @entity16 will need to be perfect , complete with a clean , fluffed - up coat , a flawless dye job and a haircut that @entity122 would be proud of			0
previous winner : @entity38 dog groomer @entity124 ' 2004 flower garden inspired design clever : @entity76 , a groomer competing against @entity7 , entered this @entity131 design in 2012 impressive : dog groomer @entity134 's @entity133 effort took home the coveted trophy in 2009 but not everything can be done beforehand : points are awarded for the transformation achieved in front of the judges , and most of the cutting work has to be done on stage in front of the @entity147 's 5,000 visitors			1
' i have no idea what 's going to happen , ' reveals @entity151 , the show 's official photographer			2
' i mean , i know what a poodle looks like but here , at a show like this , it ai n't a poodle anymore			0
lions , camels ... i 've seen buffalo			0
they 're running out of animals ! ' luckily for @entity91 , @entity16 's design has little to do with the animal kingdom and everything to do with the literary world			2
' @entity16 's design is @entity68 , ' she explains			2
' there 's quite a lot involved			0
if i mess it up in any way , it 's like anything else - you get sent home			0
' to win , she has to impress judges @entity178 , @entity180 and @entity181 , all of whom were once champion groomers in their own right			0
looks familiar : @entity186 's impressive @entity185 inspired look narrowly missed out on the top prize clever : @entity190 's @entity189 was narrowly beaten by @entity134 's @entity133 effort in 2009 ' there 's more to it than putting colour and a couple of patterns on a dog , ' insists @entity178			1
' it 's still dog grooming			1
i want to see a well - groomed dog and a well - prepared dog			0
' by the time showtime arrives , mrs @entity7 is thoroughly nervous			0
' i feel sick , ' she quavers			0
' there 's so much pressure today ! ' but despite her nerves , her @entity68 design goes on to see off competition from dogs done up as @entity210 , the @entity211 and @entity212 , and @entity16 becomes the first @entity9 dog ever to win the prestigious prize			1
backstage , a thrilled mrs @entity7 ca n't contain her emotion			0
' being able to accept yourself , trust yourself , believe in yourself - that 's what i 'm finally getting to do , ' she says			0
' i 've gone up against some of the best in the world and proved myself against them			0
' @entity224 airs at 9pm on monday 30th december on @entity18 may the force be with you ! @entity228 's 2012 design was inspired by @entity230 favourite , @entity229			1
