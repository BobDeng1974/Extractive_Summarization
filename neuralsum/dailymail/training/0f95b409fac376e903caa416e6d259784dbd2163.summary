by @entity0 @entity1 has likened his ' intense ' @entity3 title battle with @entity5 team - mate @entity4 to a game of poker			1
the drivers ' standings are currently led by @entity10 @entity4 on 202 points , with @entity12 11 points behind in second and eight races of the season remaining			1
the relationship between the drivers was subject to scrutiny when @entity1 refused to allow @entity4 to pass during the @entity20 @entity19 last month , acting against team orders			1
' @entity1 admits this particular title fight has more to it to some of those he has been a part of in the past			1
the 29 - year - old said : ' the battle does feel a lot more intense this year			2
' when i was racing against @entity57 ( in 2007 ) and @entity58 ( in 2008 , the year he won the title ) , they were in a different team and their cars had different strengths and weaknesses to my car and , in my team , it was just me that was really competing with them			2
leaders : @entity1 and @entity4 have both been on the podium nine times this season as @entity5 dominate disgruntled : @entity4 has clashed with @entity1 this season over disputes involving team orders @entity75 should have obeyed team orders - @entity4 ' now i 'm racing against a guy who has the same car as me - we both have access to exactly the same data and feedback so it is really hard to try and be ahead			1
' it 's a little bit like playing poker - you have a set of cards and the other guy is not supposed to know what you got , but @entity4 and i can see each other 's cards so then it 's more difficult to beat each other			1
' @entity1 is in no doubt that it is a tougher task directly vying to be champion with a team - mate , but has also emphasised that he is enjoying his racing more than ever at the moment			1
close competition : @entity4 currently leads his team - mate in the @entity104 but only by 11 points ' it is definitely more challenging ( than competing against someone from another team ) , because you have to find ways to create small margins , ' @entity1 said			1
' and so what you do is bring your skills , things that you 've learned , things you can put into the mix. ' and you always have to move forward - you ca n't just be good and that will be enough , you have to keep pushing the boundaries , because every time you take a step forward the other guy makes an equal step so you have to keep doing it			0
' reflecting on his 2008 triumph , he added : ' it was great because it was the beginning of my @entity3 career but a lot of the things that went on in the sport at the time were n't so enjoyable			2
' now , with so much more experience , i 'm able to really enjoy the sport more			0
i 'm happier and can focus solely on racing without any of the distractions i had back then			0
' thrill : @entity1 took tv presenter @entity22 for a spin during a high speed interview @entity1 says his overwhelming feeling when claiming the title in 2008 was relief , and he does not believe the experience will count for too much in his pursuit this time around			2
' when you win a championship , for me it was a relief , because you worry all year , you think about it non-stop , ' he said			0
' the only fear is failure , you know ? and so when you do win , you just kind of think : " oh thank @entity151 for that and go relax now "			0
' it 's not all " yeah , yeah i won , i won ! it 's the greatest thing ! " ' i know i 've been there before because i 'm going for my second championship but it feels like i 'm going for my first			0
it does n't feel like i 've had one already and i 've experienced it			0
' every race is different and every season is a new experience			0
every sunday you feel different , every start you feel different			0

@entity4 currently leads the @entity104 , 11 points ahead of @entity1
only eight races remain in the @entity3 season for the team - mates to do battle
@entity1 ignored team orders to let @entity4 pass during the @entity20 *gp*
