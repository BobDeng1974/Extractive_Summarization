the interim report by the deputy children 's commissioner @entity17 warned @entity5 is used by gangs to arrange ' sex parties ' where children are abused this includes encouraging girls to swap sexually explicit images on mobiles , adults grooming children on social networking sites such as @entity5 , and the viewing of extreme or violent pornography and discussing it during sexual assaults			1
children groomed online are taken to ‘ parties ’ , where they are drugged or plied with alcohol ‘ so that they did not know what was happening to them ’ , the study found			2
‘ this made it impossible for them to identify the perpetrators			0
’ the interim report found that 2,409 children and young people were confirmed victims between august 2010 and october 2011			1
a further 16,500 children were at ' high risk '			2
of sexual exploitation between april 2010 and march 2011			0
ahead of the report 's publication senior government sources branded it ' hysterical ' and half - baked			1
there was particular criticism that the report appeared to play down the significance of @entity70 men targetting white girls			2
but speaking at @entity74 's questions , @entity72 backed miss @entity17			2
he told @entity75 : ' this is a very serious issue that is being examined			0
it is an interim report that has been produced which we need to study very carefully			2
it has some extremely disturbing findings			0
' we need to give every encouragement to the @entity82 to ensure the final version of the report is produced			2
' deputy prime minister @entity85 also defended the report			1
he said : ' there has been some idiotic response from someone within @entity90 , an absurd response			0
this is obviously a serious and credible report that needs to be taken seriously and taken seriously by the government			0
' according to the interim study , in one abuse network , 2,900 vulnerable children were connected to the main perpetrator who used social networking sites to maintain contact with potential victims			1
the report highlighted the case of @entity104 , not her real name , a 13 - year - old white @entity107 girl , who was sexually exploited by a group of boys form her school			0
when her parents were not at home a group of boys went round for a ‘ sex party ’ which was advertised on @entity5			1
‘ following the incident @entity104 was coerced into throwing further ‘ sex parties ’ whenever her house was empty , ’ the report said			0
@entity121 , a white @entity107 teenager , revealed ‘ a book being available with photographs and ages of all of the girls being sexually exploited by this particular group			0
men could choose which girls they wanted ’			0
the deputy children 's commissioner warned that thousands of youngsters in @entity18 were being abused every year aged 13 , she was taken by a @entity132 man to a variety of ‘ parties ’ across @entity18 at several smart houses and ‘ mansions ’			1
the report found groups of men aged 14 to 70 trawled @entity5 and other social networking to groom vulnerable children and arrange parties where there would be raped			1
miss @entity17 said : ‘ we ’ve found people who are perpetrating these terrible crimes against children up to men in their 70s , so sometimes they are organised , and yes , there are different models , so sometimes we have organised groups of @entity153 males in relation to white girls , but that is not the only model			0
‘ it is desperately important that people wake up to all the evidence			0
i ’ve seen , for example , hard evidence from police			0
i ’ve got a picture in my mind of an enormous piece of paper with photographs on it of victims and offenders in one part of the country			0
the vast majority of the offenders there were white , so everybody needs to recognise that this is happening in a number of different cases in various communities , ’ she told @entity158			0
social networking sites like @entity5 have come under growing pressure to act amid claims they are used by perpetrators of child abuse			1
shadow children ’s minister @entity187 told the @entity188 : ‘ companies such as @entity5 and other social media should be called before mps to explain what they are doing to stop this happening			1
’ a @entity5 spokesman said : ' we have a zero tolerance policy for child exploitative behaviour on the site and such activity is rare			1
' however , when illegal behaviour is detected @entity5 works with law enforcement agencies such as @entity202 to ensure that these people are brought to justice			1
