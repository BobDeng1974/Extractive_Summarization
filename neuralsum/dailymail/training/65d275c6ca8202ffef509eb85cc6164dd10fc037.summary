by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 18:41 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 19:09 est , 4 november 2013 @entity4 ’s plan to encourage businesses to pay a ‘ living wage ’ would put 300,000 young people out of work , a former aide to @entity2 warned yesterday			1
the @entity10 leader will today announce that he would offer tax breaks to firms who pay their employees £ 8.80 an hour in @entity15 and £ 7.65 in the rest of the @entity17 – far higher than the minimum wage , which is £ 6.31 an hour			1
but @entity19 , who helped mr @entity2 introduce the minimum wage in 1999 , warned yesterday that the policy would be a disaster for jobs and hit young people particularly hard			1
political adviser @entity19 who helped @entity2 roll out the minimum wage in 1999 has warned new living wage estimates will be dangerous to jobs ‘ the national minimum wage was subject to intense economic scrutiny to make sure you set the level at a level which would not destroy jobs , ’ he said			1
‘ the @entity32 is £ 8.80 an hour , which is a 40 per cent increase or more on the minimum wage			1
‘ i do n’t think you can increase wages that much without destroying jobs			0
‘ a study says that if you implement it across the country it would lead to 300,000 young people losing their jobs and i do n’t think we can afford that at a time of high unemployment			2
‘ many decent people support this campaign			0
’ the @entity10 leader is expected to suggest people are ' working for poverty ' in a speech today mr @entity4 will use his speech today to say that there is a ‘ low - pay emergency ’ in @entity17 , with people ‘ working for their poverty ’			1
‘ more than five million people are now paid less than the living wage – up 1.4 million in just the last four years to one in five of all employed workers , ’ he will say			2
‘ and low wages are n’t just bad for working people , they cost money in benefits too as the country has to subsidise more and more low - paid jobs with higher and higher tax credits and benefits			2
‘ many businesses now recognise that a low - pay economy is bad for them , too			0
better pay means lower turnover of staff , higher productivity			0
’ attempting to make the cost of living the major battle line before the general election , mr @entity4 will again press his calls for state controls on energy prices			2
labour figures – audited by the @entity81 , – show how the wholesale cost of energy has risen at an average rate of 1.6 per cent a year since 2011 , while the @entity86 energy firms have increased retail prices by an average of 10.4 per cent a year			0
@entity10 will force a vote in the @entity90 tomorrow on mr @entity4 ’s plan for an energy price freeze for 20 months after the next election			0
the @entity10 leader challenged the @entity94 and @entity95 to back the plan .			0
