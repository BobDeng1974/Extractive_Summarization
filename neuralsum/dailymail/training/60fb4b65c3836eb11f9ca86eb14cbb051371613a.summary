@entity1 manager @entity0 has not given up hope of @entity3 playing some part in the @entity6 derby			1
the @entity8 striker has been sorely missed by the @entity9 since sustaining a thigh injury on international duty earlier this month but is inching ever closer to a comeback			1
in his absence @entity0 ' side have lost to @entity15 and @entity16 , snuck a last - gasp win over @entity18 in the @entity19 and required penalties to see off @entity21 in the @entity22			2
' we 'll be very happy to have him back and we hope that can be this weekend , ' said the @entity41			0
' we 've got a number of injuries that we 're going to give every chance to			2
' he ( @entity3 ) is a player who 's out on the field working			1
him and a number of others we 'll just assess nearer the time			2
but if he does n't make it he wo n't be far off after that			0
' he 's someone that responds well to treatment			2
obviously it 's gone well but there are still a couple of days to go before the game			0
the most important thing is he 's near to fitness			0
@entity3 is no chance of being match fit after he was injured on duty for @entity8 , but @entity0 says he is a chance to come off the bench against neighbouring @entity64 rivals @entity65 ' he certainly wo n't be match - fit , he has n't played for a few weeks , but it 'll be great to have him back because he 's a wonderful player for us			1
' he 's a great reference for our team at the top of the field , his pace and movement and quality , which we saw the last time he played against @entity77			0
' another of @entity0 ' talented young @entity8 stars , @entity80 , has been linked this week with @entity82 giants @entity81			1
the 19 - year - old forward , whose contract at @entity30 runs until 2017 , is one of the brightest young talents in the @entity64 and has had an impressive start to the season but his manager is not losing sleep over the reported interest			1
' it shows that he 's playing exceptionally well , ' said @entity0			1
@entity81 's interest in @entity80 ( right ) shows he 's playing ' exceptionally well , ' said @entity0 ' i think you could probably link @entity80 with every club in the world at the moment			1
he 's a fantastic young talent			0
' i 've nothing really to add to it			0
there 's obviously lots of speculation every day about players coming and going here at @entity1			1
' he 's a wonderful boy who 's developing very , very well here			0
i think him and his representatives and the people close to him know how comfortable he is here and i 'm sure at some point in the future , whatever contract we 're looking to work with will be sorted , but he 's still got three years left and there 's no rush from my perspective			0
' video see both @entity24 goals for @entity25			0

@entity0 said he hopes @entity3 will return on *saturday*
@entity1 face @entity65 at @entity30 on a lean run of form since @entity3 hurt his thigh while on duty with @entity8
@entity0 said he 's giving a number of players every chance to be fit
he also said @entity81 's interest in @entity80 is a *reflection* of how well his *teenager* sensation is playing
