by @entity0 boxing day : @entity2 , leftovers and bored children			2
that faint feeling of self - loathing that comes from having spent too much money on things you did n't need or want			0
the @entity11 manicure that looked so witty is now tawdry and chipped by washing up			0
the unmistakeable throb of a nascent spot on your chin			0
my solution is to banish husband and children to the nearest park / multiplex / football game and embark on my annual post-festive purge			0
@entity0 brings you something to keep your carb - addled brains entertained : a reminder of all that was fabulous and / or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013			1
behind the fridge , the oven , the cupboard under the sink : nothing will escape my rubber gloves and bleach			0
and if i 'm feeling really brave , i 'll slip into my bio-hazard suit and tackle my daughter 's bedroom			1
a clean house equals a clear mind , and there 's no better way to see in the @entity43			1
that said , i do realise most people will think i 'm mad			0
so , for those of you who will be spending today curled up on the sofa with the remnants of a family - sized box of celebrations , here 's something to keep your carb - addled brains entertained : a reminder of all that was fabulous and / or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013			1
the year began , as it so often does , with a new diet			0
popularised by an episode of @entity62 and the @entity64 's hugely successful 2 - day diet , it involved adopting a reduced calorie intake on two out of seven days			1
@entity66 , pictured here at the @entity67 , brought twerking to the mainstream , much to most of our dismay the benefits are bountiful : lowered cholesterol , lower blood pressure , regulation of blood sugar , improved mental clarity , focus and concentration			1
oh , and weight loss , which , let 's face it , is all we really care about			1
best of all , though , was the relative ease and simplicity of the thing			0
after all , everyone can stay off chocs for a day at a time ; it 's doing it for weeks on end that 's hard			2
so , while we all bored each other senseless with details of our new regime , a truly terrible portrait of @entity97 was unveiled to provide a little light relief			0
write caption here somehow artist @entity100 made our radiant @entity102 look as if she 'd been pulling night shifts in a dust factory			0
the royal couple were polite about it ; not so the critics , who professed themselves truly impressed by the way @entity100 had managed to turn one of the world 's most beautiful women into an old bag			2
one for the vaults , i fear			0
at the @entity116 in february , some men turned up in beards , causing a frenzy and eliciting endless column inches about the ' return of facial hair '			2
granted , those men included @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 ; but ' man grows beard ' is not exactly a new story			0
meanwhile , @entity129 dyed her hair pink , an uncharacteristic lapse of taste for which we have yet to receive an explanation			1
@entity138 leaving court earlier this month - her immaculate makeup makes her @entity0 's beauty heroine of the year even more baffling was @entity141 's decision to get an entire rosebush tattooed on her behind			1
but then @entity144 shaved her head , @entity146 ran a marathon in full make - up , @entity149 forgot to wear her pants at the @entity152 premiere and @entity153 turned up to a party in not much more than her tights - and @entity157 's bottom rose seemed tame by comparison			2
@entity160 , this year there were plenty			0
there was the vampire facial , involving blood and needles ; teeth grilles ( as worn by @entity169 and , less plausibly , @entity170 ) ; selfies ( photographs of one 's perfect body snapped in the mirror of from the perspective of the sun lounger ) ; belfies ( a selfie from behind ) ; twerking ; and extreme waxing , the latter two pioneered in eye - watering detail by pop star @entity66			1
@entity177 ( as demonstrated by @entity178 of @entity179 , left ) and tattoos ( right , @entity141 's enormous rose artwork ) were big celebrity trends of 2013 as predicted , @entity97 gave birth to a baby and then promptly alienated half the female population by ' snapping back ' into shape			1
luckily she redeemed herself a few weeks later by stepping out on an official visit with - gasp ! - grey roots , which was either an act of pr genius or a genuine oversight			0
either way , a triumph			2
the year ended on a beauty high : the release of make - up artist @entity197 's new cosmetic range , which saw @entity199 ' beauty hall mobbed by women desperate to get their hands on @entity153 's lipstick and @entity204 's cheek - contouring palette			1
not since the launch of @entity208 's make - up line ( which was also devised by @entity197 ) have cosmetics been this exciting - and with one advantage : her eyeshadows do n't cost Â£ 64			2
but for all @entity214 's genius , the beauty triumph of 2013 was @entity138 's court face			1
from @entity129 's pink hair , to @entity170 's ill - advised grilles , we bring you the best and worst of this year 's beauty trends doubtless the experience of having her marital laundry aired in public was deeply unpleasant			1
but never has a woman looked so utterly fabulous under pressure			0
let 's not forget that before she became the queen of cupcakes , she wrote about beauty for a newspaper			1
if she ever tires of cooking , there 's always lipstick			2
my prediction for 2014 ? a @entity138 make - up line			1
stranger things have happened .			0
