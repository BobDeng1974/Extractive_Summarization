according to the @entity1 , there are more than 33million refugees in the world			0
on what seems to be an entirely unrelated note , there are 700million wooden shipping palates produced each year in the @entity8 - 150million of which find their way to landfill each year			1
but one project aims to bring these two facts together in a win - win scenario : converting those pallets into cheap , environmentally friendly houses which can be deployed quickly - and even turned into permanent homes			1
tarpaulin is then draped over the basic structure , which prevents water penetration until enough debris , stone , mud , earth , wood or corrugated metal from the immediate surroundings can be gathered to fill in the wall cavities and cover the roof			0
in areas of severe weather , pallets may be pre-assembled with styrofoam insulation or a vapor barrier to help keep the structure safe			2
the project won a @entity54 in a competition to design transitional housing for the returning refugees of @entity58 , and the @entity59 says that a team of four or five people could build a house using nothing more than hand tools in the space of a week			1
a 250 square foot house can be constructed using 100 recycled pallets and five people within a week as a temporary shelter , tarps draped over the structure prevent water penetration until enough locally available materials are gathered to fill the walls and cover the roof the makers said : ' the @entity20 project was initially conceived as a transitional shelter for the refugees returning to @entity58 after the war			1
' these people needed an immediate alternative to the typical tent solution that could potentially transform into a new permanent home over time , even without access to sophisticated tools and materials			0
' it has since become our aim to also develop the project as a more permanent housing solution to serve not only refugees in disaster stricken areas but also as a modular , prefabricated solution to affordable housing everywhere that can improve people â€™s lives , the environment , society and even inspire greater diplomacy among the various cultures of the world			2
' pallets are versatile , recyclable , sustainable , easily assembled and universally esthetically pleasing			0
they are readily available in most countries and their transportation cost and weight is negligible when used to carry shipments of clothing , food , medical supplies or other relief aid			0
' a simple pallet structure evolves naturally from emergency shelter to permanent house with the addition of more stable indigenous materials like rubble , stone , earth , mud , plaster and concrete			0
' home from home : the @entity20 can easily become a permanent structure , and could be deployed in developing countries pick a style : the homes can take many forms , and be built by hand in less than a week			1

' @entity59 ' aims to help *re-house* millions of refugees
a permanent structure can be built by a team of five in a week using 100 pallets
@entity8 throws out 150million pallets a year
