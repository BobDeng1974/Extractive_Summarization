with a name like the horrid groundweaver , you might think few tears would be shed at the prospect of this tiny beast 's extinction			2
tricky to find due to its size and its habit of living deep in the cracks and crevices of the limestone , it only comes out at night and has only ever been spotted twice			1
but conservationists are warning that despite its trifling size and shy demeanour - and its unfortunate name - action needs to be taken to protect @entity18 , which is found only in a single @entity20 city			2
nothophantes horridus : the horrid groundweaver could be driven into extinction by plans to build homes on an old quarry in @entity25 the spider has only ever been spotted at @entity25 's old limestone quarries - one of which has since been developed into an industrial estate			1
now there are plans to develop a second quarry with 57 homes , a move campaigners fear could kill off the horrid groundweaver completely			2
' the horrid ground - weaver is an extremely rare species , ' said @entity36 , a spokesman for invertebrate conservation charity @entity37			1
' it is amazing that one of the world 's rarest spiders is only found in @entity25 - and that is why @entity44 is of global significance for wildlife			1
' failure to protect this site could be catastrophic for this tiny spider			1
this development could push the spider even closer to extinction			2
this site is critical to the spider 's survival			1
' nearly 2,000 people have already signed a petition calling for planners to reject the scheme to save the endangered species - specimens of which measure just 2.5mm in length			1
the nocturnal spider was first recorded in in 1989 and then again in 1995 , and has not been seen since			0
but campaigners insist its future must be secured			0
refuge : plans to build 57 homes on its last remaining sanctuary have been submitted @entity71 by @entity72 what 's in a name ? the spider 's name comes from the fact that its body is rather bristly - the @entity80 origin for the word horrid is bristly @entity82 , 33 , planning manager at @entity37 , said that because the spider was so rare , they did not know why it had chosen @entity25 as its home			1
but she said it could like the more temperate climate on the south coast			0
' it can happen either because the species ca n't reach other locations or because the conditions are favourable where they live , ' she said			0
' this means that over time species can become localised , such as with the @entity96 , and because it has lived and adapted there , it now does n't exist anywhere else			0
' it 's very unique , and we need to look after it and make sure we do n't drive the species to extinction when we really do n't need to			2
it might have lived in other locations , in other quarries for example , which have been built on , but it has never been recorded anywhere other than @entity25			1
' we believe that it is probably just clinging on at the last few sites			0
' it must just like the weather on the south coast			0
we think it lives underground , or in cracks in stones , but in truth we do n't know much about them because they are so rare			0
' the spider 's name comes from the fact that its body is rather bristly - the @entity80 origin for the word horrid is bristly			1
plans to build 57 homes on its last remaining sanctuary have been submitted @entity71 by @entity129			0

the spider has only ever been spotted at @entity25 's old limestone quarries - one of which is already developed
now there are plans for a *residential* development on another site which could *damage* the spiders ' habitat
