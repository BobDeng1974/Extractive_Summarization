by @entity0 fears that the morning after pill may be less effective in overweight women are unfounded , experts say			1
last november the maker of @entity6 - a morning after pill available in @entity8 - changed its packaging to state the pill did not work among women over a certain weight			1
at least 200,000 prescriptions a year are written out for @entity6 , @entity15 ’s most popular emergency contraceptive , which contains the same key ingredient as @entity6 - as does @entity17 available in the @entity18 morning after pills such as @entity6 - contain the ingredient levonorgestrel - are effective in heavier women , experts say the @entity8 manufacturer referenced studies which showed the pill is less effective among women who weigh more than 11st 11lb and does not work at all in women over 12st 8lb			1
the average @entity15 woman weighs around 11 stone			0
but after a review , the @entity31 has said @entity6 is suitable for heavier women			1
in a statement , the @entity31 said it had assessed all the available evidence and announced the data ' are too limited and not robust enough to conclude with certainty ' that the pill 's efficacy is reduced in heavier women			1
while results of these studies should be included in the product information , current warnings on @entity6 's packaging should be deleted , it added			2
the morning after pill contains a higher dose of the hormone in regular birth control pills			2
the drug is thought to prevent pregnancy by interfering with the release of eggs and disrupting fertilisation			0
it may also stop any fertilised egg from implanting in the womb			0
taking it within 72 hours of intercourse can cut the chances of pregnancy by up to 89 per cent , but it works best within the first 24 hours			0
fears had been raised after a @entity8 morning after pill manufacturer said its product was less effective among women who weigh more than 11st 11lb and did not work at all in women over 12 stone 8lb the issue about weight and efficacy came to light two years ago , when an @entity71 study found that obese women were more than three times as likely as those of normal weight to become pregnant after taking the morningafter pill			1
the link was particularly strong for levonorgestrel - based pills			0
it is thought that the drug may be diluted in bigger women or broken down more quickly by their bodies			0
it is also possible that the drug is soaked up by their fat cells , stopping it from working properly			0
professor @entity88 , the study ’s lead researcher , advised bigger women to have a copper coil , or @entity91 , fitted or take @entity92 , another morning after pill containing a different chemical			2
it works for longer than @entity6 and is more effective and can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex .			2

fears *sparked* last year when @entity8 manufacturer changed packaging
said pill less effective if over 11st 11lb and would *n't* work after 12st 8lb
@entity31 conducted a review into evidence
said data regarding weight limits is ' too limited and not robust enough '
