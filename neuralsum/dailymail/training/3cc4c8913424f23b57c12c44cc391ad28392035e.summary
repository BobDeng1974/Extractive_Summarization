’ ‘ hi , it ’s me			0

miss @entity176 added : ‘ @entity10 told me that this woman treated many people badly at the station , but nothing was done because of her senior status			2
' it seemed everybody was scared to tackle her			0

’ neither @entity53 , responsible for policing in @entity29 , or @entity253 , which covers @entity148 , could find any record of mr @entity10 reporting the alleged harassment			1
