people living in certain parts of the @entity2 are being forced to pay up to £ 170 million a year more for their broadband , due to a ' postcode lottery '			1
new research from a broadband comparison site has revealed that in some cases , families are paying more than double what their neighbours are , despite living just 50 yards apart			1
the study , the biggest ever of its kind , looked at more than 1.7 million postcodes covering 97 per cent of @entity2 households			1
research from @entity16 looked at 1.7 million postcodes and found that people in @entity18 and the @entity19 have the greatest choice of provider , price and speeds			1
residents in @entity25 and @entity26 had the worst with some people paying £ 5 more than their neighbours the study from @entity16 found speeds and prices often differ from street to street - sometimes within 50 yards - with postcode affecting choice of providers , deals and available speeds			1
this system means 13 per cent of internet users are being penalised because they do n't have access to cheaper deals - adding more than £ 60 to their yearly broadband connection bills			2
millions of broadband users are also suffering from reduced download speeds and limits			2
in some areas customers can choose from 10 providers , while others have just five options			0
this means that although some could pay as little as £ 2.99 per month for their broadband package , others are being forced to spend £ 8.15 or more			2
the difference in availability does n't only vary from county to county , some users in the same towns and even the same street can get better deals than their neighbours			0
those living on @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , for example , could find themselves paying over twice as much for their broadband than other houses less than 50 yards away - but getting just a third of the download speed of their neighbours			1
@entity91 residents of @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity84 , pay an extra £ 5 per month as well as receiving slower download speeds and having two fewer providers to pick from compared to neighbours just half a mile away on the same street			1
the survey also reveals a north south divide in the number of providers			0
those in the @entity81 have an average of 10 while those in the @entity106 have a pool of 11 to choose from			0
@entity25 has the worst overall broadband choice where users have the narrowest choice of providers - at an average of eight			1
the county also has the slowest advertised download speeds of just @entity115 and pay the second highest minimum costs in the country of £ 5.47 , second only to @entity26 residents who have to pay a minimum of £ 5.99 a month			0
@entity18 topped the study with the lowest broadband costs at just £ 2.99 per month , average advertised download speeds of up to @entity124 and an average choice of 12 providers			1
people living on @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , pictured , pay over twice as much for their broadband than other houses less than 50 yards away - but get just a third of the download speed of their neighbours those in the @entity81 can take some solace in the fact they just nudge the @entity106 when it comes to average advertised download speeds with @entity139 compared to @entity140			1
the difference in download speeds between counties ranges from @entity144 to @entity145 , meaning a two - hour hd film takes as little as 10 minutes ( at @entity145 ) to download , whilst for others it will take nearly an hour			0
@entity149 , of broadbandchoices.co.uk , said : ' broadband has become an essential utility for people in the @entity2 and it 's madness that in 2013 people are being penalised simply due to where they live			0
' the government has a responsibility along with providers to ensure a consistent standard of broadband service for every household in the @entity2			0
residents living at one end of @entity93 , @entity94 in @entity84 , pictured , pay an extra £ 5 per month , get slower download speeds and have two fewer providers to choose from compared to neighbours just half a mile away at the other end of the street ' however , with the recent announcement that the government will now roll out superfast services to 95 per cent of homes by 2017 , it seems the goalposts are being repeatedly pushed back			2
' most customers will not even be aware that they are at a digital disadvantage			0
these discrepancies in speed and price occur when different broadband providers install their technology in different exchanges located around the country			2
' if your local exchange has been ' enabled ' by lot of different providers , you will have a great selection of broadband services to choose from			0
however , if you only have a handful of providers enabled at your local exchange , your choice will be extremely limited			0
' he added : ' strong broadband competition is vital to ensuring that customers get the best possible service at the best possible price , but even if you live in an area with limited options you should still regularly shop around			2

new study compared broadband choice and price at 1.7 million postcodes
it found some families are paying double their neighbours
