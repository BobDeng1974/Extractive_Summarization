by @entity0 , political editor in @entity1 published : 19:33 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 03:20 est , 4 december 2013 @entity4 has brushed off calls from the @entity6 to ease the tax burden on millions who have been sucked into the higher rate of tax			1
the prime minister suggested his focus was instead on further increases to the starting threshold for tax and to ‘ extend further ’ tax breaks for marriage			1
mr @entity4 said a move to offer a £ 1,000 transferable tax allowance to married couples with one basic - rate taxpayer , to be detailed in tomorrow ’s @entity21 , was ‘ the start of something i would like to see extended further ’			1
refusal : @entity4 has brushed off calls from the @entity6 to ease the 40p tax burden chancellor @entity26 is also preparing to offer more than 20million basic - rate taxpayers a further tax break , despite calls from the @entity6 for him to do more for middle class families who have been dragged into the 40p rate			1
the chancellor is expected to lift the starting rate threshold to £ 10,500 by the time of the next election , a move which he may signal tomorrow or in next spring ’s budget			0
a dramatic and expensive hike in personal allowance thresholds from £ 6,475 to £ 10,000 means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax since 2010			0
for the average taxpayer , it will amount to paying £ 705 less income tax compared to when the @entity43 took power			0
but at the other end , the numbers dragged into paying the higher 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million by 2015			2
mr @entity4 , speaking on a visit to @entity49 , insisted the government ’s focus on the starting rate was right			2
aides pointed it offered some benefit right up to incomes of £ 120,000			0
‘ lifting the income tax threshold benefits all but the richest because it does benefit people on middle and even higher levels of pay , ’ the prime minister said			0
married couples : the prime minister suggested his focus was instead on further increases to the starting threshold for tax and to ' extend further ' tax breaks for marriage ‘ by next april it will be worth around £ 705 to the typical taxpayer so i think it ’s been a very good way of trying to help families with their finances at a difficult time but recognising that there should be a benefit as we keep the costs of @entity51 down and pay down the deficit			1
‘ at the same time , i ’m a low - tax @entity6 , i believe in allowing people to keep more of their own money to spend as they choose			2
offer : chancellor @entity26 is also preparing to offer more than 20million basic - rate taxpayers a further tax break ‘ but i ’m also a fiscal conservative , i believe the first duty of government is to safeguard our economy and the economy is n’t safeguarded properly until you deal with your deficit and make sure that you ’re in a position where future problems that could come down the road , you ’re able to absorb them			1
’ on the proposed marriage tax relief , he added : ‘ we will be making this change to back marriage in the tax system			2
it ’s a change i strongly support			0
it ’s very similar to what we set out in our manifesto			0
‘ i believe in marriage , i believe marriage should be recognised in the tax system			2
i see this as yes , a start of something i would like to extend further			0
’ despite rumours that he and the chancellor disagree on the marriage tax break , mr @entity4 insisted : ‘ i have a very , very strong relationship with the chancellor			1
we work together hand - in - glove			0
’ changes announced in the last budget mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher - rate tax will be £ 41,865			1
it means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the @entity129			0
normally , the 40 per cent higher - tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living			2
but from april 2014 , the point at which higher - rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead			1
this lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net			0
official figures , from @entity142 , show there were just three million higher - rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in may 2010 .			1

@entity4 has brushed off calls from @entity6 to ease 40p tax burden
suggests his focus is instead to ' extend further ' tax breaks for marriage
@entity26 is also set to offer basic - rate taxpayers a further tax break
