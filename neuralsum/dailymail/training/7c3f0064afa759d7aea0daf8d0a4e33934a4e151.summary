a mother and her daughter have been awarded more than $ 15m in compensation after the woman hurt her back as the bus she was traveling in went over a speed bump , it merged today			1
@entity7 , 20 , on a shopping trip with her four - year - old daughter @entity9 , jumped in her seat as the coach hit the traffic speed bump and landed so badly on her back she damaged one of her vertebrae			1
no - one else was injured in the incident and at first the bus driver refused to believe she was in pain			1
eventually she was taken to hospital where she had to have back surgery			0
@entity7 was thrown against the back of the seat , damaging one of her vertebrae			2
she can still walk but her lawyers say she is in chronic pain spin to win : critics says the case throws up the irrationality of the @entity45 legal system - where such a large figure can be arrived at			1
the payout included $ 10m for @entity7 's emotional pain and suffering on top of $ 3m for her medical expenses in the past and future distress : the huge award also included $ 1m for @entity9 's emotional pain caused by witnessing the accident now three years later , a jury has ordered the transit company to pay the unemployed mother $ 14.3m in compensation , including $ 10m for her emotional pain and suffering			1
her daughter was awarded a further $ 1m for past and future emotional pain caused by witnessing the incident			1
ms @entity7 , who can still walk , said she was pleased to have received the money as the incident had put ' a tremendous strain on her and her family '			2
but others criticised the size of the pay out , the biggest in the transit company ’s history			0
@entity75 , senior fellow at the @entity76 think tank the @entity77 , branded the pay out as ' spin to win '			1
' why $ 10 million for pain and suffering in this one case ? ' he said			1
' why $ 1 million , paid by taxpayers , to a 4 - year - old for seeing her mother fall off a bus seat ? why not $ 100,000 and $ 10,000 instead ? ' in a case like this the @entity45 legal system has no real reason for picking one number rather than the other and no real consistency between cases			1
it 's just spin to win			1
ms @entity7 , her daughter and other members of her family were travelling to buy birthday presents at a mall in @entity101 , @entity102 , when the incident happened in august 2011			2
the @entity106 - @entity105 bus driven by @entity107 hit the speed bump at 30mph – twice the limit as it was a school zone – and the impact catapulted ms @entity7 into the air			1
the jury were shown a video of ms @entity7 flying up and then as she lands hitting her back on the edge of the plastic seat			2
the film then shows ms @entity107 stopping the bus and walking down the isle accusing ms @entity7 of faking the pain			1

it is estimated she will need a further $ 2.4m worth of treatment throughout her lifetime			2
at the time , @entity140 refused to admit any liability until it was time and then offered $ 2.75m out - of - court settlement			1
it conceded that @entity147 's injuries were its fault but argued that they , along with ms @entity7 's inability to work , were exaggerated			1
but ms @entity7 , represented by @entity153 - based firm @entity151 & @entity154 , fought the case and this month a jury at @entity158 jury awarded her and her daughter $ 15.3m			1
the pay out included $ 10m for her past and future pain and suffering , $ 3.3m in past and future medical expenses and $ 800,266 for future loss of earnings			1

' i am happy to have been able to show the jury i was seriously hurt and was unjustly attacked by @entity140 , ' she said			0
' i pray they do something so this never happens to anyone else as it has been a tremendous strain on me and my family with more to come			0
' ms @entity7 is able to walk but says the injury leaves her in constant pain and that the condition will get worse in the future			2
it has also affected her sex life and she is unlikely to have more children			2

she has a fused spine and she is going to need to have future surgeries			0
' it has severely damaged her quality of life and it is only going to get worse			0
she can walk but she struggles to bend and stoop			0
' it is going to be hard for her to get a job			0
rather than accepting responsibility for its negligence , @entity140 instead chose to challenge ms @entity7 ’s credibility			0
that tactic did n’t work , and the jury did the right thing with this verdict			0
' life sentence : @entity7 's lawyer said she has a fused spine and she is going to need to have future surgeries			0
it has severely damaged her quality of life			0
she can walk but she struggles to bend and stoop ' fellow attorney @entity212 added : ' this verdict will ensure that ms @entity7 is able to get the long term treatment that she needs and will be able to take care of herself and her daughter			2
' that is what this case was about			0
' meanwhile , mr @entity75 added : ' what i can say is this : no rational system would give out this much money for every incident like this , even accepting the plaintiff 's claims '			1
@entity140 spokesman @entity229 said it was still looking over the details of the pay out			0
' we are still mulling over the verdict as it were and deciding what the steps may be , ' he said			0
' we have no comment in the meantime			0
