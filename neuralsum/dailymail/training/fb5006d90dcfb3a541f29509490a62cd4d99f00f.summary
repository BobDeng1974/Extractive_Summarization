climate change could bring about the greening of @entity3 by the end of the century , scientists predict			2
today only four indigenous tree species grow on the island , confined to small areas in the south and three quarters of the world 's most most sparsely populated country is covered by a barren ice sheet			0
but by the year 2100 swathes of verdant forest could be covering much of its land surface , potentially changing the landscape and making life difficult for arctic animals , according to experts			1
climate change could bring about the greening of @entity3 by the end of the century , scientists predict			2
today only four indigenous tree species grow on the island and three quarters of @entity27 is covered by a barren ice sheet but this could change by the end of this century , scientists warned ' @entity3 has ... the potential to become a lot greener , ' said lead scientist professor @entity31 , from @entity32 in @entity33			1
' @entity37 like the coastal coniferous forests in today ’s @entity36 and western @entity35 will be able to thrive in fairly large parts of @entity3 , for example , with trees like sitka spruce and lodgepole pine			1
' he said : ' it will provide new opportunities for the @entity3			0
' the research showed that with expected levels of warming , a majority of 44 species of @entity50 and @entity51 trees and bushes would be able to thrive in @entity3			1
many species could already grow in small numbers in @entity3 today , according to the analysis published in the journal @entity59 while images like this one might make it seem unlikely , scientists have predicted that trees found in @entity36 and western @entity35 will be able to thrive in fairly large parts of @entity3 , providing new business opportunities for islanders one reason for the island ’s lack of current greenery is the slow speed at which forests expand by themselves			1
computer simulations show it could take more than 2,000 years for @entity3 ’s indigenous trees to spread to every area blessed with a suitable climate in 2100			1
despite this handicap , a key species such as the @entity80 dwarf birch could be established over more than 400,000 square kilometres - an area almost the size of @entity84 - by the end of the century			2
the transformation would alter @entity3 ’s ecosystem , leading to the loss of @entity80 animals and plants			1
on the other hand there could be significant commercial possibilities linked to forestry , agriculture and tourism			0
a species such as the dwarf birch ( pictured ) could be established over more than 400,000 square kilometres - an area almost the size of @entity84 - by the end of the century , according to the scientists but humans could play an active role in the greening of @entity3 by helping to speed up the spread of new plant species , says prof @entity31			2
' people will often plant utility and ornamental plants where they can grow , ' which he believes is in our human nature			0
' he said : ' such plantings could get a huge impact on the future @entity3 nature as a source of dissemination			0
this certainly has positive aspects			0
a warmer @entity3 would also be much more vulnerable to invasive species , he added			0
' if imports and planting of species will take place without any control you may get a very chaotic and @entity126 - like development , ' professor @entity31 warned			0
if temperatures do rise as predicted and @entity3 develops forests , the transformation is likely to alter the island 's ecosystem , leading to the loss of @entity80 animals and plants			1

@entity32 research predicts forests similar to those found in @entity36 and western @entity35 could thrive in parts of @entity3 by the year 2100
the scientists said that if temperatures rise as predicted , 44 species of @entity50 and @entity51 trees would be able to thrive in @entity3
the transformation would alter @entity3 ’s ecosystem , leading to the loss of @entity80 animals and plants
