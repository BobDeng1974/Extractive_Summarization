you do n't need helicopters , diamond rings , @entity3 or designer watches to enjoy yourself			2
that 's the message from a group of @entity7 who have taken to social media to spoof the @entity10 of @entity11 - a notorious account on which members post flashy pictures of their impossibly wealthy , sun - drenched lives			1
their @entity7 counterparts have come up with their own versions of images posted by the more moneyed @entity19			0
the idea came from a @entity53 campaign aimed at showing you do n't need to have lots of money to eat well			0
@entity53 however invited @entity7 teenagers to send in their own versions of the @entity58 of @entity11 snaps , minus the obvious signs of money and the expensive things that it buys			1
@entity7 @entity53 fans who took part in the campaign also replaced lions with cats , infinity pools with inflatable ones and supercars with toy cars			2
they then posted them under the hashtag # distractiepebaniputini , which translates from the @entity7 as ' fun with little money '			0

a lion cub on the dashboard of @entity80 ( left ) is spoofed by a domestic cat in a slightly less expensive vehicle the @entity7 teens posted under the hashtag # distractiepebaniputini , which means ' fun with little money ' the reptile on the right looks considerably less threatening than the one on the left - maybe because it 's a toy the @entity7 may not have had a baby big cat ( right ) , but they boasted a similarly hirsute equivalent ( right )			1

group of teens has *mercilessly* mocked @entity10 of @entity11 account
