@entity1 walked disconsolately back from his parked car , an oil leak having ended his participation on the wind - blown tarmac of the @entity6 airfield called @entity7			1
that was the scene on friday afternoon in practice for the @entity13 @entity12 — a race that , should @entity1 win , would act as balm for the national sporting mood after our cricketers , our footballers , our rugby players have fallen to defeat home and abroad this year			1
he had completed just 14 laps in the session , compared to the 35 of his @entity27 team - mate and world championship rival @entity28			1
‘ the car was feeling pretty good , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ i just missed the most important run			1
i ca n’t keep stopping , but we ’ll learn from these experiences			1
’ yet , in what @entity1 ’s supporters will hope is a happy portent ahead of qualifying and the race on sunday , he was still top of the timesheets by 0.288 of a second			1
rain is forecast for this part of @entity53 over the weekend , during which @entity7 ’s rich history will be celebrated			1
a parade of old cars , driven by old stars , will be part of it			1
it will link the first race here in 1948 — the @entity63 — to the present day , the 50th staging of a grand prix			1
back in those post-war days straw bales marked much of the circuit			1
now the tv cables are so extensive they would stretch from @entity69 to @entity70 and back			2
cool britannia : @entity1 would have benefited if @entity28 was given a grid penalty we sit in the wing — a £ 27million extravagance — where there was once open space , the hum of @entity79 refusing to die			1
on saturday a couple of @entity81 , their beautiful merlin engines , the purr of perfection , will fly over the circuit			2
speaking of engine noise , this will be the first time that the new hybrids will have been heard live by most of the 300,000 weekend audience			2
@entity1 is joining in with the patriotic theme , wearing a @entity91 on the underside of his cap peak			2
‘ it ’s always a special weekend for us @entity13 drivers , ’ he said			1
‘ winning this race is like winning an olympic gold medal			2
‘ coming here , seeing the fans , having already been at @entity102 ( for the @entity103 ) and seeing how many people were there and the support coming into this weekend , it ’s very exciting , the feeling of being at home is really a great one			1
‘ the support , as i say , for me and @entity111 and the guys here , it ’s unlike any other place we experience			2
we are going to do our utmost to try to represent and perform for the country			2
‘ with @entity27 as a leading team , hopefully we ’ll have a good shot this weekend			2
i ’ll do everything i can to bring at least a little bit of joy and add to the great success that some of the top athletes have had			2
’ standing in his way is @entity28 , the blond assassin who leads him at the top of the standings by 29 points			1
the @entity133 was calmness personified in his post-practice interviews on friday			2
rarely has a @entity138 driver been more assured and more focused than this man			1
by this point in late afternoon , he knew he was in the clear despite overtaking the @entity141 of @entity142 under a red flag in the first session			2
@entity111 had been moved three places back on the grid for the same infraction in @entity148 last year , but the stewards here — including the crowd ’s old favourite @entity151 — deemed that he was not to blame because @entity142 had slowed to 24mph in a ‘ very unusual manner ’ and he had taken ‘ reasonable avoiding action ’			0
@entity1 is taking tablets for hay fever			0
‘ everything comes from the doctor and is @entity159 approved , ’ he said			0
‘ when i was kid i had a severe allergy			0
i remember doing my gcses and sitting there with a big box of tissues and everyone was getting on with the exams and i was blowing my nose all the way through			0
‘ i ’ve tried every medicine on the market since i was 10 and i only take it when i really , really need it			0
‘ i have n’t driven with hay fever for a while but it is just this weekend being in @entity174 with the weather having been great and the pollen high			0
’ the two men see only as much of each other as their jobs demand			0
@entity1 is staying at his father ’s house in @entity182 , driving in each day			0
@entity28 is sleeping on site in his motorhome			1
‘ @entity189 ’ is the new word for it — a contraction of ‘ glamorous camping ’			0
penalty : @entity28 risked a grid penalty at @entity7 for passing drivers under a red flag leading the way : @entity28 leads the drivers ' championship by 29 points from @entity1 each of them is trying to find the fractional advantages that can be found in the minute details			1
‘ you are looking everywhere to make a difference but the other guy is too , ’ said @entity1			0
@entity28 and i work quite well together			1
we are battling each other fiercely , but when @entity28 does his debrief he says all that he has to say and vice-versa			1
' but on the track there are things you hope will give you time			0
he might take an apex early for example and hope that i do n’t see that in data and vice-versa			0
’ can anyone possibly stop either of these two ? without the intervention of the weather it is hard to see how			0
the @entity27 is too quick for all the rest			0
that is what makes this a fascinating mano a mano contest			0
the stakes are even higher because if @entity1 does not win the title this year , one wonders whether he ever will again			0
different ball game : @entity28 plays with a football in the @entity27 garage at @entity7 but the season is only into its ninth round of 19 and there is time for @entity28 ’s successful run to be stopped , just as @entity1 ’s early form was			1
@entity1 said : ‘ the tables turned against me in @entity241 and broke my momentum			0
he ’s had it for a few races and now it ’s time to do the same thing the other way round			0
‘ it ’s still early days but there is never a point where you can be too relaxed and think there is a long way to go because there will be a time when it is too late			0
‘ there is no time like the present and this is the best place to do it			0
it is almost like a sailing boat that needs a gust of wind to change direction			0
i hope that the @entity13 @entity12 and the fans can do that for me .			1
