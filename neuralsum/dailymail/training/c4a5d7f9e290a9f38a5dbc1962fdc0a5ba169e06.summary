by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 19:48 est , 30 april 2012 promoting marriage : @entity2 and his wife @entity3 @entity2 last night signalled support for a major campaign to promote marriage and turn back the ‘ appalling ’ tide of divorce			1
the @entity8 , widely seen as the social conscience of the modern @entity10 , indicated he was wholeheartedly behind a bid by high court judge sir @entity12 to end the ‘ destructive scourge ’ of family breakdown			1
sir @entity12 will formally launch the @entity17 today in a bid to raise awareness of the vital role of marriage in bringing up children			1
the senior family court judge said he felt compelled to speak out because of the unprecedented scale of the problem			2
he added : ‘ i happen to think that the family judiciary have a contribution to make to this debate			2
most of us have watched as the situation has gradually got more and more and more appalling and out of control and there comes a time when it is , i think , irresponsible to remain quiet			2
‘ this is now happening across @entity35 – and indeed @entity37 and @entity38 – on a scale we have never seen before and the impact it has on the whole of society is very , very real and dramatic and we need to highlight it and do something about it			0
’ the initiative received a mixed reaction at @entity48 yesterday			0
mr @entity2 , whose social justice strategy paper earlier this year underlined the importance of marriage , indicated his support			1
cool reaction : @entity54 ( left ) said politicians should avoid being judgmental on the issue while @entity57 ( right ) said not everyone in a marriage had a good time saving marriage : the campaign will seek to raise awareness of the vital role getting married has in bringing up children a source close to mr @entity2 , who has been married to @entity3 for 30 years , said : ‘ he thinks it is a great campaign – it has his wholehearted support			1
’ but the @entity71 leadership responded coolly			0
@entity54 , who married 11 months ago , said he did not think politicians should be ‘ judgmental ’ on the question of whether people get married			0
and former @entity71 children ’s secretary @entity57 said that he and his wife @entity76 – who wed 14 years ago – believed marriage was ‘ a better way forward for our children ’ , but warned : ‘ not everyone in a marriage has a good time			1
’ high court judge sir @entity12 said family breakdown is ' destructive ' speaking at a press conference in @entity85 , he said : ‘ what i ’m not going to do is become moral or judgmental about people who are n’t married			1
’ launching the @entity17 in @entity85 tonight , sir @entity12 will stress he is ‘ not courting politicians ’ , saying they ‘ did not create the current epidemic ’ of divorce			1
but he adds : ‘ if we are going to improve things , we need consistency of approach and for many years to come			0
on this issue the record of politicians and political parties is simply not reliable			0
’ the organisation will instead seek to set out the facts about the impact of family breakdown on children ’s prospects and provide practical support for couples			1
it already has the backing of a string of senior family lawyers , including former president of the family division @entity113 and divorce lawyer @entity115 , who represented prince @entity116 and sir @entity117			2
other high - profile backers include the chief rabbi @entity119 and the archbishop of york dr @entity120			0
research by the @entity124 think - tank found that 26 per cent of cohabiting parents had split up by the time their first child reached the age of five , compared with only 9 per cent of married parents			0
another study has estimated the total cost of family breakdown to society at £ 44billion a year			0
sir @entity12 yesterday accused celebrity magazines such as @entity134 ! of promoting unrealistic expectations of marriage			1
he added : ‘ we all know , all of us who have been in relationships – whether married or unmarried – for a long time is that the only way that they are made to work and the only way that they become really qualitatively good is by absolutely grinding away at it			2
‘ that ’s when people find that , actually , if they get through the difficulties and do get the help , they will in fact end up with a product that is really worth having			0
