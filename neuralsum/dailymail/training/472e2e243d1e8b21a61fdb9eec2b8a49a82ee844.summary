by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 2 april 2013 it used to be the case that if you threw this dog a ball , it had to be a very long way from the grass			1
because if @entity11 the @entity10 stepped on a lawn , her paws would break out in painful lumps			1
her owners , @entity15 and @entity16 , soon discovered she had a host of allergies , including a resistance to grass and pollen			1
they spent more than £ 10,000 on medication and special foods to combat her symptoms , without success			1
but then a friend suggested they try her in a set of ‘ doggy boots ’ – and now she can enjoy pain - free walkies for the first time in years			0
mrs @entity36 said : ‘ the shoes have made a huge difference			1
‘ the allergies were all year round			0
as well as giving her serious eye and ear infections she ’d get these horrible lumps between her toes that would open and bleed			1
‘ the pads under her feet have virtually worn away from the years of pollen and grass allergies			2
‘ we had to carry a 30kg ( 5st ) dog out of the house because her feet were too tender to walk on the gravel driveway			0
but now she can run around with our other dogs			0
her quality of life has changed			0
’ come outside : @entity36 and her husband @entity67 ( right ) bought @entity11 when she was a nine - week - old puppy we are family : @entity11 is pictured ( right ) with the @entity16 couple 's two - year old @entity70 ( left ) mrs @entity36 and her husband @entity67 , 40 , bought @entity11 from a breeder when she was a nine - week - old puppy , but it was n’t until she was two that they noticed something was wrong			1
' the pads under her feet have virtually worn away from the years of pollen and grass allergies ' @entity36 , @entity11 's owner their local vet found she suffered from many allergies , including intolerances to wheat , soya , rice , gluten - and also reacts badly when coming into contact with cats , dust mites and pollen			1
mrs @entity36 said : ‘ she was our first dog together			1
we ’d only been married a few years before			0
our families had had dogs but they ’d always been healthy			0
i ’d never heard of a dog with a grass allergy			2
‘ i did n’t think it was possible			0
our cat @entity99 now lives with my parents so that @entity11 does n’t have to come into contact with her fur every day			1
’ dog shoes : the @entity48 boots had to be shipped over to the painters from a specialist company in @entity108 the vet tried a range of things and when he ran out of options , he referred @entity11 to a professor of dermatology at queen mother @entity115 in @entity117 , @entity118			1
' over the years we ’ve spent thousands of pounds			2
if you think there is something that can help and cure them you could n’t live with yourself if you did n’t do it ' @entity36 , @entity11 's owner she was put on a course of steroids , antihistamines and a special allergy - free diet			1
mrs @entity36 said : ' over the years we ’ve spent thousands of pounds			1
if you think there is something that can help and cure them you could n’t live with yourself if you did n’t do it			0
‘ we would 've tried anything			0
the steroid tablets made her incontinent and the antihistamines made her drowsy			0
she was miserable , lethargic and not herself			0
we could n’t avoid grass			2
attempts : @entity36 spent more than £ 10,000 on medication and special allergy food to combat @entity11 's allergies without success ‘ it was impossible			1
so we had to bath her with special medicated shampoo after every walk			2
she was constantly licking her paws where she was sore			2
after six months , although on medication and a new prescription diet , there was really no improvement			2
’ then a friend told the couple , who also have a two - year old @entity44 called @entity45 and a wire haired @entity10 , @entity46 , 14 , about boots she had bought for her dog to protect its paws			1
the boots , which had to be shipped over from a specialist company in @entity108 , have a soft rubber sole and are attached using velcro			1
@entity11 has two sets - one for summer and another for winter			1
poorly paws : a local vet found @entity11 suffered from a range of allergies , including intolerances to wheat , soya , rice , gluten - and also reacts badly when she comes into contact with cats , dust mites and pollen mrs @entity36 said : ‘ the first time she wore them , she just stared at them			1
she was kicking her back legs out when she walked but soon got used to them			0
now she wo n’t leave the house without them			0
‘ when we get ready to go out , @entity45 brings them to her with their leads			0
most people we see when out walking assume i ’ve dressed her up for fashion , like a silly handbag dog , which annoys me			2
the boots are for medical reasons			0
‘ some dog owners , however , are fascinated by them and many say they would like some to help their dogs with cut paws and weak bags legs			2
‘ so i now carry cards around with me with the name of the boots to give out			0
luckily , they ’re stocked in the @entity201 now so we do n’t have to pay shipping			0
i do n’t know where we ’d be without her boots			0

@entity11 , 11 , comes out in painful lumps on her paws when walking on grass
@entity36 , of @entity210 , spent £ 10,00 on medication and special food
but ' @entity48 ' from @entity108 now protect @entity10 's paws outside
